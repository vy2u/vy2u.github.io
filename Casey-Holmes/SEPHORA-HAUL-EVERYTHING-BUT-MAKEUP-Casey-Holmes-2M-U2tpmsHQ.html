be doing an unboxing a bunch of stuff
that I got from Sephora and so excited
to share with you because this is a haul
from Sephora that has no makeup in it
and ever happens to me normally on my
colleages boa foundation here I shadow
in there this has no makeup in it so I'm
really excited to share with you guys I
asked you on Twitter if you want to see
it all of you said duh do which tell me
- so I'm here I'm excited also I'm sorry
my face is a little bit more warm than
my chest right now because my self tan
is currently developing normally this is
the shade and I comes out - so yeah it's
just developing so it's a little off
tone line but I'm sure you can forgive
me right so don't forget to subscribe
before you leave and give this video a
thumbs up if you liked it and let's just
go ahead and see what is in this box
cuz I kinda forgot I'm pretty sure this
is the biggest box that ever happens for
us so I ordered this with like two days
shipping and for some reason it took
like a little over a week to get here so
I'm very confused on why that is if you
guys know let me know down below and
we're doing something wrong usually I'm
not usually it's pretty self-explanatory
where you order two day shipping and it
comes in today somebody's interested at
the time and it hasn't been so I want to
look going on like I said is the biggest
box I've ever gotten from Sephora and
I'm really excited especially because I
forgot some of the stuff I got now I
will say a Kathleen is like the reason
behind majority of this haul because I
watched her perfume haul and favorites
video for summer and I was like I don't
like perfume I want to try some new one
the first thing is that I guys actually
did two fresh honeysuckle moisturizing
hand cream got this fresh honeysuckle
moisturizing hand cream because I love
honeysuckles I love the way that they
smell and I needed a hand cream for my
purse everytime I'm traveling I always
find that I don't have hand creams
because you know when you use the
airport soap and all that in the
bathroom - like really drive your hand
out so I wanted to pick something up
just to have and this smells so good it
really just like honeysuckle like it
doesn't smell like fake honeysuckle oh
it takes me back to when I was a kid we
had honeysuckles everywhere I love it
and it feels really good on the skin so
yeah I just need to pick up my hand
cream so this is I went for next thing I
got something I've heard a lot of people
talk about and it is the
whay haircare rose it's the way it rose
hair and body oil and I love row so I
want to test this out and see if it was
good or not I want to just open it up I
don't wanna actually squirt it out it
does smell really good smells like a
like a rose with a little bit of a
different flower I don't know it smells
nice so I'm excited to attest this out I
want to try out a new hair mask it is
the living proof restorer masks
treatment it says it deeply nourishes it
reverses damaged and what did you do
this because I've been trying to get a
new mask so I just have am able to find
one that I love so very Aldo with living
clips next because a lot of people seem
to really like this brand for their hair
I figured I'll try this out if you guys
have any hair masks that you recommend
let me know down below in the comments I
haven't tried a different hair mask
since I was using the macadamia fever
hair mask and I loved that but I really
feel like that was bracing on my back I
mean I haven't used it in a while but
every time I did use it I noticed
breakout um so yeah which I'm still
struggling with it now which you guys
have recommended a wash from a back
that's like over the counter at Target
and well rain thumbs up and it has been
working I'm definitely going to wear it
is I need to use it for a few more days
but I swear it's been putting in work
you guys save the day all the times but
anyway so I figured I would trends out I
have fine hair but I have a lot of hair
so I don't like too heavy of a mask
because there's an old way my hair down
and make it really oily so if you have
any recommendation let me know I just
have dry in you trying to refresh them
make them feel smooth again stuff this
is kind of like a surprise purchase for
me I for sure thought I had this perfume
and then I look at my little perfume
rack which if you follow my blog channel
you see this beauty room if you haven't
a difference check out my blog channel
I'll have a link down below I was
looking and I was like mmm do not have
this perfume but I have the travel size
perfume and I always purchased the
travel size one so I was like alright I
think it's time I purchased the big size
so this is the classic scent smell so
good YSL black Opium's but it just look
like this it's so pretty and it just
smells so good and I find that this
perfume lasts so long on my body
I'm smells so good
I know I'm going to know how to describe
it but is a really really great sense
hard for me to find a perfume now I'm
like obsessed with this is definitely
one I love mainly because it lasts all
day and it smells delicious
like delicious like I didn't think I
would ever go for its scent like this
cuz I'm more of a rose very floral
feminine but this is like kind of sweet
feminine like more vanilla and not in
some necessarily rose but this is good
okay and the next step is actually a
body oil that I'm pretty sure I read on
this before website that this was what
Miranda Kerr used instead that she loved
it yes oh it says recognize but
creatives love by Miranda Kerr I read
also reviews on this so I had to check
it out because I do struggle with really
dry legs and then if I try to like
prepare myself with going into the
winter here at drunk I want to be
prepared and make sure my skin is smooth
and soft and not like a dry crocodile
this is just a luxurious lightweight
multi-purpose body treatment oil
combining powerful organic noni extract
Road tip and sunflower seed oils
providing the skin with a rich source of
antioxidants and essential fatty acids
I'm a sucker for body oil let's be real
and it comes oh it's nice so it comes
like this you have to top off and it
just has this which is actually really
travel friendly I love that so I would
recommend keeping this top if you ever
want to travel with it a lot of product
I feel like I smell I smell it's a
little bit of both I definitely smell
the rose tip I'll just smell the
sunflower seed oil so I'm really excited
Tess about I'm really here's know what I
think because we're always on the hunt
for the best moisturizer ever which let
me tell you this what I'm about to show
you right now I do restock on and you've
probably seen this a million times if
you follow my Sephora haul but this
glock seat on ultra rich body cream this
is such an amazing body butter if you
have really really dry skin and you just
need something to really get in there
and hydrate this is great this is more
like a nighttime moisturizer or if
you're really dry throughout the day
then you can throw this on but if I put
this on my legs I'm trying to put some
skinny jeans on they're not going up my
legs because this is so moisturizing and
it does leave that film not
see film but it's definitely got a film
on top where it's really moisturizing so
I would recommend using this at night
but it is one of my favorite I love it
i'm just feeling super dry I will throw
this on and I can feel this the next day
so highly recommend it I love it and
knew I had to stock up on again because
it's one of my favorites I also got
Davis another birthday present his
birthday's coming up very soon and I got
him this cologne don't tell him I had
one of these before when I went and had
my meet up is before in New York with
benefit like to Muir year ago here in
have to I don't remember
it was like last summer I believe and I
had engraved for our anniversary and it
broke like when he was at Benning and we
were traveling along so I buy my new one
it's not engraved with our anniversary
but I was like I love the smell and I
need to smell it on you again so I got
this for his birthday it is such an
amazing Cologne you guys this and then
there should nail once you know blue or
something oh my gosh divine okay next up
I have this set okay always yeah I have
um have two more perfumes and then I
have some diffusers and a body Milkha
Singh so this is the Phil McCartney Oh
de Parfum natural spray I got again
smaller size of this because I'm trying
these perfumes I like to get the smaller
size this is just look like I have
really great reviews online I just want
to test it out so let's see
hmm
it does smell good but very alcoholic I
don't know I don't think I'd like that
what this reminds me of is like faculty
used to drink vodka this is why would
smelly I don't think I like it
oh no I don't think I like it I'll keep
you guys updated but I feel like this is
a really well-known perfume and a lot of
people enjoy it
I just don't think it might end a scent
so this I have been so excited about
because I've never tried a perfume Larry
oil and I'm sure you just use this with
me Flowerbomb perfume but I'm not the
biggest fan of flower ball I know I know
I'm crazy just whenever it reacts in my
skin it kind of gives me like a musty
scent instead like a really nice smell
and then it gives me a headache so I
can't ever use it but I figured I would
try to stop because it is the flower
brawl it is the flower blah is the
flower bomb Rhodes twist and I know it's
the same flower bomb fragrance but it
has a rose twist to it and hoping that
this reacts better with my body
chemistry and not smell crazy or give me
a headache
perfume there are 3 trial and error
because you can smell it in store and
like spray it on you and you're like oh
this smells amazing but if you let it
last for like thirty minutes to an hour
and like let it work with your body then
you get the real scent and you can tell
you're like oh no no no no but anyway so
this is what it looks like
you can mix this with different perfumes
you can use it by itself and I've heard
perfume oils lasts really well on the
skin so you know I had to try it see
this looks like oh listen I thought that
would be like a rollerball but it's not
you just like open it up like this like
you just twist it isn't really how it
works whatever how are interesting see
I've never used on these before you just
roll it up Wow
so it's just the oil you pour it onto
your skin ooh and like that hmm I think
I'm really going to like that I think
this mixed with a couple of the
different perfumes that I have like the
Chloe perfume that smells like roses
will smell absolutely amazing with this
even this Dior blooming bouquet oh I
think this would smell so amazing
combined with then let the dew or
blooming bouquet but it doesn't last
that long
me so this can make that last longer and
also incorporate this in into it I think
I'm going to be obsessed and I'm Justin
so intrigued to try oil all right let's
move on to some other products that I
have I did pick this up because I have
been really into bad lately and I just
wanted to see it is really good because
I have really great reviews I'm always
looking for something that's going to be
nice and moisturizing I do use a lot of
lush but I figure don't try this out
this is the Laura Mercier body and bath
almond coconut milk honey bath very
pretty packaging I like it a lot it's
like when we do the pool over here take
oh oh it's like so fancy this is
literally giving me Winnie the Pooh
vibes if you don't mind waiting to is
men forget no this is looks oh oh oh oh
there's not a lid Danielle there's not a
protector look I saw something around
Christmas time wow this smells amazing
so I can't wait to try this out
a lot of reviews said that was really
moisturizing to be honest I guess you
just use this to put it in your bag that
I'm just probably going to like pour it
you know I don't know because I also
hate the way this feels kinda hurts my
teeth and that's a little weird you get
these two little goodies and I'm really
excited to turn it out I will definitely
let you guys know in my hips and this is
what works what doesn't
we're going to find out okay so another
thing I have been loving is diffusers I
have a new one back here that I got when
I was in Atlanta had them ship it to me
because I love the smell of it it just
smelled like flowers it's amazing I used
to get all my nest diffusers in the fort
bidding at their PX because they always
had them there and they were at a
discount so that's what I would always
get down but here drawn they do not have
nests but they don't have a lot of
things in the PX so I decided to go
ahead and just pick this up from the
Sephora I love this one this is the
white camellia
I think it's how you say it if I said it
wrong white floral bouquet of fresh
camilla
wisteria and Indonesian Jasmine are
intermingles of crisp notes of white tea
and amber and we tell you love spoil
sense and you just look that fresh
feminine scent this is what you need it
smells absolutely amazing and it's just
so good like to really
hi and then this looks so fancy so next
up I got something from Jo Malone I had
no idea jo Malone is being sold on
Sephora and I was like uh yes I am
definitely gonna buy something so
they're always so fancy with their
packaging I love it they go the extra
mile and in here we have another
diffuser this is called red roses and
it's a scent surround diffuser and it
just looks like this it was absolutely
stunning and then you do have your wicks
in here as well which I love how classy
this looks it just looks so nice I
wanted to try this out I was a little
nervous because I've never purchased a
diffuser that I haven't smelled like I
knew what this meant like so I bought it
but I've never purchased a diffuser
online without smelling it because I'm
very picky about those as well and it
smells like roses I am going to be
obsessed with this this definitely
smells like roses I mean there's no
extra vanilla or anything like that
added to it it just smells like
beautiful roses and I cannot wait to put
this up in a room so this one I have
that here is from antic afar meseta I'm
sorry and it's called ala moana
oh it just smell like fresh flowers like
you know when you have like gardenias or
something like growing outside and you
can just smell it this gives that
gardenia scent but not as powerful it's
just so fresh and it just smells like a
pure flower like you're putting out to
your nose and you're sniffing it I'm
obsessed with floral scent there's just
something about it some people can do
for completely wrong and it just does
not smell great at all smells too musky
or something with that I love that and
it goes with my themes I think that is
all that I've got from Sephora I really
hope you enjoyed this haul I know it was
a lot and there was a lot of different
things but I'm super excited tested out
think the only thing I really didn't
like was this one right here just the
scent is not my favorite but the most
part I'm excited to try everything else
out that they use so much for watching
