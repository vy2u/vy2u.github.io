today I have a Sephora hits and misses
for you purchase all this stuff and I
was like oh it's time to do a haul I'm
so excited and then I realized I
probably should try some of this stuff
out before I shared it with you because
there's quite a bit of stuff I mean
there's not like a 30 minute long video
worth of stuff but there's some stuff in
here I'm excited to share with you guys
all so I hope you don't mind I'm in a
sweatshirt this is actually like a
sweater dress is from Free People
I don't know why I did that my little
bra let is also from free people and
it's just cold in my house it's like 67
degrees I don't want to turn on the heat
because I don't like turning on the heat
in my house I know that sounds a little
bit weird I would much rather just add
on warm clothes then turn on the heat
unless it's like super cold also if you
guys have not been checking out my
Instagram you definitely should I've
been posting some outfit photos and I'm
really looking into starting my blog
back up soon I was looking at my old
blog this morning actually and I hadn't
made a post since like 2014 which is
insane so yeah I'm really enjoying doing
outfit post you should definitely check
them out on Instagram and if I do have
my blog live I will link it down below
so anyways we're gonna go ahead and just
jump into everything I do have one thing
that is PR so I'm just gonna show you
that first because I mean the packaging
just screams to me look at this now the
black glitter packaging is just my
favorite I think it is absolutely
stunning but then you also have this
silver one as well so the black point is
actually the gritty eye palette these
are new from the Estee edit line and
look at how big these eyeshadows are
these I chose are so huge and look at
how pigmented this green I just I knew
once I opened it I was going to love it
you have this pretty plum Brown will do
the shade right here then this duochrome
blue is so pretty it's like green purple
blue it's much more beautiful in person
like showing you on camera it's gorgeous
but in person it's like I haven't
actually put these on my eyes yet and
kind of going back and forth with the
thought of having to use a glitter glue
because these do have some shimmer in it
but I don't know how well they're going
to hold on the lid but I'll definitely
try them out with and without a glitter
glue and let you guys know the next
thing that is stunning is the glow face
and eye palette these are some gorgeous
highlighters list
try I mean everything is so soft and
pigmented I just I can't get enough of
it so there are some of the highlights
shades right there
absolutely stunning put them on the back
of the hand so that's they look like
swatched they really catch the light
beautifully and I love the color
selection in this I feel like if you're
a freelance makeup artist you'd really
like this highlight palette because you
can use this on so many different skin
tones so the next product about to share
with you guys is something I did not
like I got this online and you always
kind of you bet you gamble when you buy
scents online you know what I'm saying
like it's one of those things where I
see they're gonna be a hit or it's gonna
be a miss this was unfortunately a miss
not because of the formula and how it
hydrates the skin I didn't even get that
far because I could not stay in the
smell this is a Moroccan body body
butter and this is the scent fleur de
ros now I love floral scents I love the
smell of roses I love I just love that
smell I think it smells so good this is
so heavy it could knock you out if
you're not careful I definitely think
the jar makes it look bigger than it
actually is but having 6.4 fluid ounces
is pretty good I love the packaging I
think it's beautiful it looks gorgeous
when it's sitting on your counter but
the smell is just Oh
when I first smelt it it gave me jo
Malone vibes like it reminds me of the
peony scent that Jo Malone has and I
love that I've had the lotion from them
I have the perfume but this one it
smells good but when you put on your
body it could just be my chemistry with
this scent but it smelt like Bo all over
my body maybe it's just the way head it
reacted with my body but the scent was
just terrible I could not stand it had
to take it off and I never wanted to put
it back on my body again next thing I
want to quickly shout out to you guys I
did get a couple Vita Liberata tanning
mitts you guys know I love these and
it's that time of the year where I got
to start self-tanning I have a little
bit on right now I don't have much I'm
just having like whatever's left over
but I do love these self tan mitts if
you want a free one I do use loving tan
and I have a coupon code where you can
just get a free minute not to buy one
but I like to have these in stock just
in case one goes bad or I don't have
another loving tan one so I love these I
think they're great they apply really
smoothly the only thing that sucks about
these is that they break easy
you like right here at the edges where
your fingers are and sometimes my
fingers poke through the sides so I
noticed that happening a lot more with
these than with the loving 10:1 so
that's why I purchased multiples just to
have like backup next thing I have not
tried but I'm super excited to test it
out I think I need to do it actually
pretty soon because my hair is going a
little warm this is a silver conditioner
from Sasha Quan and I don't know it's
really simple packaging I kind of love
how simple this is it looks really
elegant and pretty I don't know I just
love that it's really simple to the
point and it is a pretty intense purple
shampoo so purple is just to kind of
take the brassiness out of the blonde I
go to my hair stylist pretty often and
she usually just tones it for me but
even like right now I could use a nice
purple shampoo it's just I don't wash my
hair very often and when I do I forget
to put purple shampoo in my hair smells
really good - it smells really fresh
okay I will say I've never I just
noticed this now I just noticed it's a
condition or not a shampoo I'm used to
using a purple shampoos so I'm excited
to see if this will make my hair really
soft because I always use the macadamia
do prepare mass every single time I wash
my hair that's the conditioner I put on
but I'll have to test this out this I am
really enjoying I can't tell you if I
would repurchase it yet but I've been
really loving it and I have a little bit
of ways to go before I have to
repurchase another one this is the in
row love's love's low soothe and calm
sensitive cleansing oil so since I can't
pronounce the name that's what it looks
like now this is a different cleansing
well than what I'm used to
this is like a water when yet when I
think of cleansing oil I think of the
bosha
makeup breakup cool cleansing oil where
it's like a thicker oil and it feels
like it's just kind of sliding all over
your face and like getting everything
off this feels like a water and you
could kind of see - it's thinner than
most cleansing oils and I will say I do
like this a lot it takes off my makeup
very well I've used it with intense
dramatic makeup I've used it with light
natural makeup and it takes everything
off really well I do find myself pumping
out a lot of product
that's why I've kind of gone down a
little bit even though I use this every
single day I find myself just pumping
out quite a bit and the pump
sucks okay it pumps it out so
sporadically like it's practically the
word but it pumps it out and it just
goes everywhere so you have to really
make sure you cup your hand and get it
right in there the pump is just not
consistent it doesn't distribute the
product really well you know what I'm
saying so just be aware of that because
when I first went like this and I
squirted it out it just went everywhere
and I was like oh well this is just
gonna get in here but it is really good
it has not broke me out whatsoever and
it leaves my skin really smooth as well
so even though it's not a really thick
cleansing oil I feel like it does do the
job and if you have really sensitive
skin like I do I think you would really
like this also if you don't like the
feeling of that oil being on your face
you would also really like this the next
thing I've only tried once and if you
guys follow me on snapchat which you do
don't go follow me on snapchat I tried
this once and I was really nervous to
try it because if you watched my
September hits and misses the toner from
this brand did not work for me it just
didn't work for me so this is a belief
Peet miracle revival clay mask and this
is what it looks like right here this
looks kind of like the toner kinda has a
same packaging and then you take this
off which I love this packaging by the
way I think is so cute and this is what
the mask looks like like I said I've
only used it once but it left my skin
really smooth and soft and I really
liked it when I first used it I thought
it was great I haven't had time to do
another mask yet so that's why I haven't
tried it out again it was really easy to
apply I think it's a quick mess too I
think it looked on for like ten minutes
right right ten minutes yeah you only
leave it on for ten minutes it'll become
dry and then you rinse it off with warm
water it didn't break me out and it
didn't make my redness like flare up or
anything like that so been really
enjoying this I'm still gonna test it
out some more let you know and my hits
and misses
if a must-have or not next thing is a
makeup item I don't know if this is
still for sale but I purchased it and I
really like the color it's the project
chimps liquid lipstick from Kat Von D
from every lipstick sold twenty percent
of the retail price will go to project
chimps a non-profit organization that
has worked to stop the use of chimps and
private biomedical research and retire
them to a sanctuary so I thought that
was really cool I wanted to purchase it
because of that and also because I love
the color this is what it looks like
it's kind of just a deeper red
orange color and I don't you know for
fall this is my type of thing and I just
think it is so beautiful isn't that
stunning just like a red brick color
with a little bit of orange in it I just
love it so this is the same formula as
all of her other liquid lipsticks I do
still really love Smashbox liquid
lipsticks more they just have my
favorite formula I love them but I also
love using different liquid lipsticks
and I like Kat Von D's a lot I have so
many of her liquid lipsticks it's not
even funny next up we have this skin Inc
pure serum mist and honestly guys I
don't know why I keep purchasing spray
stuff like this like I don't ever see a
difference with things like this even
makeup setting sprays I just never see a
difference everybody else like swears by
different makeup setting sprays but I'm
always like what's going on what's wrong
with me I don't see any difference at
all this is kind of like that same thing
I purchased it thinking this is it this
is gonna be the next best thing and I
just didn't really see a huge difference
in my skin so I am gonna be sending this
back I will say it was pretty hydrating
it's just not something that I feel like
I should keep for the price you know
what I'm saying especially if I just
don't notice a huge difference with this
it has pure skin loving ingredients to
help strengthen your skin's natural
barrier in tint instantly hydrate skin i
reduced sensitivity even for blemish
prone skin I didn't notice a huge
difference with this with my sensitivity
or anything like that I mean it didn't
make it worse so that's really good but
I didn't notice it making my skin a
little bit more clear anything like that
just one of those things I was like
let's try it maybe it'll work it
probably does work I just I don't want
to take the extra step unless it's like
holy this is amazing you know what
I'm saying next thing I want to talk
about is this Becca blushed with light
palette so this is what the packaging
looks like it is absolutely stunning
Becca always has absolutely beautiful
packaging because see right there has
some texture at the top and then you
have the three shades on the back so you
get three different blushes in this
palette this one's definitely the most
matte out of all of them on these other
two do have shimmer in them I mainly got
this palette for this color right here
because it's so warm and absolutely
stunning I really do like it and then I
also love this one right
here because this is like a great
everyday kind of neutral blush I knew I
wouldn't use this one as much just
because it's so intense and flamingo
pink that I just it's not I don't know
it's not something I gravitate towards
right away but they're the three blushes
right there they are beautiful the one
thing I will say is these are so
pigmented you need the smallest amount
for them but the good thing about these
blushes is if you do apply too much you
can take a duo fiber brush and really
blend it out and it blends out pretty
easily so these are very pigmented use a
light hand with it what I say it's my
favorite blush palette ever and that you
have to have it probably not probably
not for the price tag but I did buy it
and I do like it it's just not something
that I'm like blown away by okay the
next thing that I really do like is the
anasazi aglow kit this is in the shade
ultimate glow and I have used this a
couple times and I really do like it now
I remember when people were showing
their PR packages on snapchat they were
all saying like it's not as pigmented as
the others blah blah blah and I started
to get nervous because I was like I
just purchased this online like it's not
as pigmented what the heck cuz I love on
sizes glow cos I don't get their PR
stuff but what I've purchased I really
do love and honestly I dip my fingers in
here and I was like what is everybody
talking about I think these are
absolutely stunning I mean they don't
give off a ton of product but when you
use it with a brush it is absolutely
beautiful and I really love them the one
thing I really love about her palettes
is that they're just so easy to mix and
match with to create your own highlight
that you want and I just think they are
beautiful I really like them so I
honestly have nothing bad to say about
it I love the fact that there's a big
mirror on here I love that sound don't
you I think it's worth trying out I love
how big the pans are I think that her
glow kits are worth the money so the
only thing I will say that I do not like
is the font right here I just don't like
that font something about it just
doesn't speak to me it looks kind of not
honest as you like I don't really like
that but the product on the inside
fantastic next up we have some little
Beauty Blender dupes I guess you could
say
got this little nugget thing this is the
gnome for the holidays Sephora airbrush
air brush sponge set it's 18 dollars now
that's a little like $2 cheaper than the
beauty blender I think I haven't
purchased a beauty blender in so long I
can't remember exactly how much it is
but this is $18 and you get three
different sponges I was a little bit
nervous to try this out because you know
when you try different knockoff Beauty
blenders they can be really bad or
really good like the Real Techniques one
the diamond sponge so good but I was
like you know what let's just give this
a try it's three sponges $18 I mean
that's a good deal you know what I'm
saying so I have been using this sponge
so much you've probably seen it on some
of my youtube videos in my makeup
tutorials you've probably seen it on my
Instagram I just love this little sponge
when you put it under water they expand
so well and they're so bouncy and fluffy
and it's just so easy to blend out your
foundation and concealer I'm obsessed
with this one this is my favorite now I
want another line you I don't use small
sponges I like this one for my
foundation and my concealer because you
can use this point it in to get right
underneath here use this bigger end to
get all over your face and like I said
when you put it under water it does
expand so it does get bigger than this
but it is a great sponge I highly
recommend it if you are the type to want
to use smaller sponges these will
definitely be great for you and
guarantee that they're the same texture
and bouncing this is this one so I would
definitely check this out you could get
three for the price of one okay guys
just three more things left and these
are actually two skin care products and
one makeup product now the makeup
product I have not tried yet but I'm
super excited try Doc's you know I love
her eyeshadow palette I think it is
absolutely amazing this is the Natasha -
no no prime magic primer and it's the
anti-shine flawless face space so
anything that says anti-shine I gotta
thank for it um this is what it looks
like it is actually the cutest packaging
for a primer ever like honestly and I
love the pump I just think it's so nice
it is kind of a thicker consistency you
can definitely tell that it mattifies I
mean it is already dried on my skin and
it's nice and smooth smells really fresh
I like it so far I cannot wait to put
this on my face
and she gets an A+ plus for packaging
because I mean honestly we get suckered
into packaging and this is cute this
thing I go back and forth with and some
of you are gonna be like Casey Holmes
you better get your together
because that's the best thing ever and I
know a lot of people love this but I
cannot get past the smell I just can't I
cannot get past the smell today Sunday
Riley UFO ultra clarifying face oil is
for the treatment and prevention of acne
and blackheads 1.5% salicylic acid
medicated dry oil clears congested pores
while smoothing the appearance of fine
lines wrinkles for clarifying and hia
geing support this was expensive I think
this was like $80 and you can see right
there I've used quite a bit of it oh the
first time I use this it was before my
makeup and I used it because the set was
fast drying and I have heard nothing but
great things about this for oily skin
you know acne prone skin whatever so I
decided to try this out before I put on
my makeup and it did not dry fast
I expected it to absorb into my skin
really quickly and it didn't it did give
me a really nice smooth application but
it wasn't anything super different from
my cane and Austin primer that I use
every single day that gives me a really
great soft focus finish and once I
discovered that this wasn't as fast
drying as I wanted I decided to just use
it at night and I do like it at night
but I just you guys the smell is just
I'm a big scent person you guys if I'm
putting it on my face I have to enjoy
the smell I just it's so hard for me
like the smell it really is at one point
Davis was over and I put this on my face
before bed and he went to give me a kiss
and he was like woah like this stuff is
potent and it's just it kind of smells
like I guess with pine trees be the
right word actually makes me nauseous
sometimes because it's so intense and
it's just not my favorite scent I didn't
notice it smooth out my skin when I say
that it helped with acne and my rosacea
I I don't know I haven't used it for the
past few days and my skin looks really
nice and its really smooth as well so I
personally am not the biggest fan of
this I'm on the fence about keeping it
and returning it to be quite honest with
you if you guys have any of the Sunday
Riley oils let me know down below what
you think of them what you think of this
one
I'm not alone because I feel like I'm
the only person as something negative to
say about these oils but I'm just being
honest not trying to be rude I'm just
very sensitive with smells and this is
just really intense so let me know if
you guys have tried it what you think
maybe in the comments I'll decide if I
should keep it or not last thing we have
is something that I found at my Sephora
I don't know what this call but it's by
dr. jart and se derma crit I cannot say
this is the derma green solutions Tiger
grass color correcting treatment it
neutralizes redness and protect skin it
also improves skin appears to be vibrant
this reminds me so much of the skincare
version of bye-bye redness by it
cosmetics but you're supposed to apply
this 15 minutes before sun exposure use
a water resistant sunscreen and it says
to reapply every two hours now the thing
I like about this I'm on the fence about
this one as well first off I love the
packaging I just think this is so
stinking cute it has like this little
tin top and it's just luxurious and cute
and I just love it this does exactly
what it says it really does neutralize
the redness on your face if you're oily
like myself this will make you a little
bit shiny
it made me shiny probably within 15
minutes I don't necessarily know if this
is like made for oily skin I feel like
it's more for all skin types if you have
redness this is a great product if you
don't want to apply full face and makeup
for the day if your oily I would apply
this and then apply translucent powder
on top just to mattify because it does
make you look shiny it's not a
mattifying product whatsoever it just
neutralizes your redness this is great
to use if you want to use it before your
foundation as well because it'll take
care of a lot of that redness and then
you could just put the foundation on on
top to even out the skin tone because
this does at least what for me it made
me look a little bit more fair than I
actually was and you do get 1.7 fluid
ounces of this product so let me show
you guys what it looks like that's what
it looks like right there if you can't
really tell too much but it looks like
mint chocolate chip ice cream to be
quite honest with you I love mint
chocolate chip ice cream so I'm okay
with that you can see it's a thicker
consistency it's just kind of dripping
there I mean it's not going anywhere
yeah still there definitely is thicker
which I think contributes to the reason
why it makes me a li but I don't really
use that against this product because
this product doesn't say that it
mattifies it's supposed to neutralize
the redness which is what it does so I
like this product I think it's awesome
I'm trying to figure out if I would use
it as much as I should for the price
that's kind of like what I'm going back
and forth with just can't decide if it's
worth me keeping if I'm actually going
to use it honestly I'll probably take it
back just for the price tag but it does
work if you're looking for something
like this where it's a moisturizer
that's going to calm down that redness
and really neutralize it you would
really enjoy this product because it is
awesome it does exactly what it says I
feel like I talked forever in this video
but I really hope you guys enjoyed it if
you did don't forget to give this video
a thumbs up and subscribe leave in the
comments below what you think of these
products that I've mentioned if you've
tried any of them let me know or if I
should try anything out that's new EXIF
Ora also let me know in the comments as
well or you can let me know on Twitter
and Instagram I would love to hear thank
you guys so much for watching and I will
see you all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
