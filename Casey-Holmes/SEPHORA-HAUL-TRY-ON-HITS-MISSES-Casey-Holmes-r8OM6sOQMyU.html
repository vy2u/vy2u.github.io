to be doing a Sephora try on haul and I
have a couple things in here that were
sent to me like in PR that I figured I
would throw in here but most of this
stuff is base products I don't have any
eyeshadows I do have some brow products
in here I have a couple skincare a
perfume you know just different things
like that so I figured I would show you
guys what I got and also try it on for
you if you're excited to see this before
a try on haul definitely give this video
a thumbs up so I know to continue to do
them when I do home because I find them
a little bit more interesting this way
and also don't forget to subscribe
before you leave and let's go ahead
aggressive
so let's go ahead and get started
alright so I'm going to pull my hair
back I got quite a bit on line just
things that I really want to try out
there's a ton of new primers out there's
like there's so much stuff out right now
so the first thing I got is a Smashbox
photo finish primer Iser this is what it
looks like I'm sure you guys have
probably seen this everywhere I've heard
some good things about it Dan hydration
for their like texture all-in-one power
primer plumps and moisturizes sets in
seconds and skin feels comfortable all
day so it can be used in place of
moisturizer you guys I love the primer
water so I was like I helped try this
this is a primer slash moisturizer I do
have moisturizer on now but I really
want to just try this out I'm going to
be trying like a bunch of primers on my
face so this is the bottle really pretty
I'm just gonna put some of my fingers
and rub it in is really smooth and
cooling I like that a lot it's not like
super cooling but it feels really nice
definitely is lightweight kind of get a
little tacky which is good for a primer
so I'm going to continue to use this let
you know what I think does have
hyaluronic acid in it and then moving on
to some more primers that it got because
can never have enough primers right have
the Becca velvet blurring primer which
is this one right here I didn't even
know they came out with this and then
also these Smashbox photo-finish
iconic primer stick I will be honest
normally primer sticks like this don't
work out for me but I want to try out
for you guys because I had a few
requests about it so I'm just going to
try one on one side and what
the other and just see how it looks so
the first one we're going to take is the
Becca velvet blurring primer the skin
smoothing primer creates an ultimate
canvas for all day velvety smooth finish
so that sounds really good so this is
the packaging kinda looks like the rest
of them but it does have this like soft
grey matte finish to it which I like oh
so it's pretty liquidy as you can see
I'm just going to I need a hurry now you
scoop this on my hand and I'm gonna put
this on this side of my face and just
kind of work it in my forehead this
definitely dries down pretty quickly
since it is such a thin consistency it
doesn't like sit on the skin very much
at all so it does give a really nice
soft matte finish I mean you can still
see a glow coming through but it's
definitely more magnified in that size
and does so really velvety to the touch
like it feels very very soft like the
way that feels we've got that on one
side it also says it'll eat erases the
appearance of pores fine lines and
imperfections that we have the Smashbox
photo-finish iconic primer stick and it
says delete your retouching app we
created a primer stick that instantly
blurs pores and imperfections while
eliminating shine for 12 hours
lightweight and non-drying unique silky
texture glides over the skin with an
easy tug free application looks like
that always down to try to find the new
best primer so it's like a clear little
bomb oh just like I think that was from
the lid that was on it whoo hold on hold
on that really is like smoothing out the
pores huh
just going to blend it in a little bit
put this on my nose yeah I know I don't
know which one's wears out pores more
they both kind of do it one still gives
you more of a little glow underneath the
primer and this one is more mattifying
like taking away that oil so I'm very
interested to see how these both work
out so far I think they feel really nice
I did not think I was going to like this
I for sure does going to be some sort of
greasy consistency
or to dry like the milk blurring primer
which I do not like that one at all but
this one is really nice okay and now we
have a new foundation I'm hoping this
matches because I did just self-tan but
a lot of you even asked me to review
this it's the bare minerals bear pro
performance wear liquid foundation SPF
20 this flawless medium to full coverage
that lasts all day is creamy buildable
texture for luxurious comfort stay true
mineral pigments designed for all skin
tones so this is the packaging I got the
shade 19 toffee the packaging is really
nice is a really pretty glass bottle and
it does have a pump which I appreciate
just shake it up a little bit and you
can also turn this off like where it
doesn't pump and then this way you can
pump it so I love that I wish I know
Tasha Genoa foundation X primer or
foundation had that because I took a
traveling I didn't have the top for it
and that she got everywhere it got all
over my makeup bag so I really
appreciate the little touches like
turning this knob just in case you if
you lose a lid and you need to travel
with it so I pump some out I'm going to
do one side with a brush one side with a
sponge a little too yellow for me but
we're going to try to work with it here
definitely feels really lightweight
that's pretty yellow we're just gonna
you guys know like my new favorite
foundation right now is the YSL one I
got the shade warm honey because I got a
different shade it was like Amber 60 or
something and it was so ashy on my skin
it just looked the clothes off so I'm
hoping this one will match so this is
another thing that I got in my haul so
what - so this foundation get this ear
back here plus it's hard
so nation color doesn't actually look
that bad compared to my neck so nose on
my face like so it definitely is like
medium coverage I'm gonna see if I can
try build it up but I don't know if I'm
obsessed with it alright so I'm going to
take my L'Oreal sponge houses in
normally if I can't get a good coverage
with a brush I'll go in with a sponge
because sometimes I get better coverage
with a sponge so far I like the finish
of this way better I don't know want to
save up the primer
the product I'm blending it out with but
this sides definitely looking better
seeing a sponge is the way to apply this
one it's still medium coverage that like
I can see redness peeking through here
but we're going to add concealer so far
I'm not like obsessed with the
foundation but this side looks way
better than the side we're going to try
this chemical want as a concealer it's
in the shade light it's the super
natural concealer and I don't really use
a lot of things from Kevin of Quan and I
just or stop they're expensive but this
is what the packaging looks like it's
really pretty it's like an ombre top and
I love the clear glass it's not glass
it's a clear - so that's what the dope
that looks like I actually really like
it having a curve to it at the top I'm
gonna plan on this side whoo that feels
good feels nice and creamy so much
lighter wood foundation when blended out
with sponge oh my gosh try to even out
this face real quick
Wow I actually like the finish of that
it's a nice soft matte finish I wouldn't
say it's super full coverage is more
medium foundation so yellow it's not
working for me I'm hoping this looks
okay so I'm just going to use this one
all over my face I got the shade light
which is a little too light definitely
for this foundation but it is a thicker
concealer I want to try want to see what
still back Shh girl please I'm down I
don't know what you guys but ever since
I tried tart shape tape I just feel like
concealers really have to step up their
game because I'm so picky now about what
I use like if it's not full coverage
like tart tape tape down this is
actually a really nice concealer letting
out really beautiful with a brush as
well I think if you have more dry skin
though this might be a little too matte
for you even though it's not super full
coverage it still looks really nice I'm
lending it out with a brush looks really
good as well I like it both with a
sponge and a brush
not too bad not you guys so I think this
is nice it is more of a matte concealer
so again if you have more dry skin I
don't know if you would like this but so
far I think it's really really pretty
and then I also did get this before I
make no mistake high coverage concealer
so I think I'll save this for a full
face of first impressions because I
still want to try this it's like super
tiny and I want to see how full coverage
this is and this one is any shade zero
for ginger I'll just go ahead and open
it and swatch for you guys you can see
the shade blue that it's thick and is it
stick concealer oh I don't know smell
like that has that conceit the
consistency of like a concealer pot
which normally I don't like those
concealers because they tend to make me
look even more oily and a little bit
greasy throughout the day so just keep
that in mind
yeah I don't know if I'm like that so
that's this a for10 ginger this is the
Kevin ik lon
okay so now I'm going to set my face
with this Too Faced Born This Way powder
and still trying this out and it does
have a little top on it am I only one
who doesn't understand like the top like
I get it's great for traveling but I
still find that I have to like pour it
out and get messy I don't know just me
probably okay so what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to just this all over my
face I'm not going to bake with it I'm
going to take it on my mr. right brush
as always and just press it into the
skin so far I think I'm liking the
Smashbox primer more than the Becca one
I really feel like it smooths out the
texture I'll still have to try it out
with different foundation and everything
and keep you guys updated so far from
first impressions the side looks
flawless another foundation that I got
is the Estee Lauder Double Wear stay in
place makeup and I got this because you
guys told me that they reformulated it
without SPF so it shouldn't flash back I
tried this before it was flashback so
bad and picture I also have a new shade
in four in one I think I used to use
four in one this is what it looks like
though it's just like a staple
foundation that was amazing it's very
full coverage it lasts all freaking day
and they just now came out with a pump
specific
for this foundation I mean finally if
you can't get the si letter pump for
them the max foundation pumps do work on
this but it does not come with a pump
just so you know moving on I guess you
can go to browse because I have for bra
products
I've been trying lots of new brow
products just trying to find like my
favorite new way I don't know I think I
kind of got bored with brow and I really
want to try some new things out to have
a few I used to use this all the time
this is the on salvia tinted brow gel
but I got the shape blonde this time
since I am a little bit lighter I used
to use the more golden one so this is
what it looks like I really love these
brow gels because it keeps them locked
in all day she did change the brush on
these one of the sides is longer but I
used to use this and I loved it so
interested to touch that out I also got
this Sela stay all day waterproof brow
color I came in here this is a pencil or
what this is oh yes like a little brush
since I'm loving like that or gel brush
I want to try this out oh that's really
like oh no this might work in the inner
part of the eye so we will see then I
got two new benefit brow products I have
the precisely my brow pencil and then
the goof proof brow pencil I just didn't
know which one I would prefer normally I
don't like thin pencils just because
they take forever for me to put on my
brows I'm like sitting there for hours I
feel like but I got the shade number two
I do love been distraught products
though I always think they just work so
well and this is the shade 2 which is a
nice like taupey color and it also has a
spoolie on the other end which I love
and then this goof proof brow pencil I
also got in number two this one
definitely yeah it has a wide tip to it
so I might like that a little bit more
we will see so the packaging is a little
bit different but you do again have a
sleeve on one side and then yes I might
like just a little bit more so this
one's quite a bit thicker which I love
you guys have used the Augusta's via
brow pencil that's not the smallest one
but the bigger one this one is a little
bit thinner than that and has a better
shape to it it goes like super pointy to
a thicker in which I like so you could
still get like a nice precise line but
also fill in more of your brow so we're
just going to
in these brows I'm going to actually try
out this one the goof proof brow pencil
to me forever do my brows as it is
because they're definitely not sisters
or twins
I like this brow pixel I've never tried
that was really quick I've never tried a
brow pencil this shape and I really like
it okay so that's the brows I really
like these products I think these are
nice I don't know how I feel about this
Stila one just yet I need to try it out
a little bit more but the benefit ones I
really do like okay so now we're going
to set them in place with this on Sophia
teaches brow gel in blonde which should
just see what this color looks like last
time I use these they were really
pigmented that's why I loved them oh
yeah
still there it just adds like little
highlights to your brows and makes them
look more natural you see the difference
and it also locks your brow hairs into
place so I'm going to include a few more
products for my face and then I had just
sitting in my drawer this I did
purchased a couple weeks ago so I'm
going to try out for you guys it's the
st. Tropez three-in-one bronzing powder
so as you can sculpt bronze and
highlight I did open this up and look at
it and I'm kind of like doing those how
that's going to work but we will just
have to stay pretty decent size compact
you really big mirror and then these
shades in here so I'm on the fence like
what I want to do because normally I
just mix colors like this all together
actually let's just try it let's just
mix them all together alright just wing
it I will say I'm on the fence about it
but
oh that's a really pretty color okay
eating my words I sing them all together
just gives you that perfect color looks
so good blending out really well I mean
saint-tropez is not known for makeup
they're known for their self tanners so
I'm really surprised that this is going
so well honestly
first first use love it so now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to take the
tools techniques brushes I use to
contour sometimes I'm going to use this
darker shade and try to contour with it
okay so Becker came out with these
highlighters the previous holographic
packaging ever so I'm Trent multi test
but they're the light chaser
highlighters for face and eyes and this
one's pearl flashes gold champagne dream
flashes Bellini and then topaz the
flashes gilt these were sent impr I gave
a bunch of the other ones away but I
kept these to test out on my channel so
this is what the packaging looks like
they're really tiny smaller than their
other highlighters and then there is a
color this one's in the shade topaz
flashes guilt so that's that one that's
a little too goal for me but I think you
have more deeper skin tone you might
like that it's kind of weird though it's
like going it's like a gold but then it
goes to like a blue light green it's
very interesting okay this one is in the
shade a pearl flashes gold I figured
this one was when I like the most but
there's pearl flashes gold yeah
oh that it's really really pretty and
then we also have champagne dream
flashes Bellini right there you can see
it's just going to more of a pink shade
so I probably I'm going to use this one
right here
I don't know if I'm feeling it we try a
different brush definitely going to
enhance some texture
I don't know if I'm obsessed with the
formula I mean the shades are pretty but
I also kind of doesn't look like the
same thing on each cheek which is weird
think it's just a little like if you
feel the formula it's not as soft and
creamy like I was opal I'm going to
apply a little bit opal on top just to
kind of give us a good sheen feel like
we were losing that by more reflective I
would say you're going to Tribeca
highlighters and you're not really into
trying different kind of shades and you
want something that's going to be like
everyday highlighter I will go for her
regular one now we're going to try out
some of these lip products so this is
the CIPA this girl looks absolutely
stunning on here like in her highlight
is just pop in I love it but these
aren't the glitter slip it says take
your lip game to dazzling new heights
with another world first innovation from
Co a London glitter flip transforms from
Matt - metallic lipstick into a full
dimensional glitter with just the press
of your lips prepared to flip out so
very excited to test this out I do love
a good glitter lip I don't know man I'm
just all about it lately so you have
like pinks kind of more peachy Reds
pinks and then going down to like purple
and blues and this teal look stunning
dude I need to know a highlight she's
wearing because it looks amazing on her
oh it's a charger oh that's very nice
it's so pretty at first day I have to
say I thought that was the packaging of
it and I was kind of looking for it so
we're going to go crazy and we're going
to try a conic which is the blue why not
ready top is glitter oh my gosh it looks
so nice I'm going to swatch all three of
these for you
very pigmented there's candy so we have
fortune looks really pretty and then the
one I'm going to be trying which is
iconic so pretty so they're the three
shade I like the applicator so much it
kind of has like that little indent
right there to just cup your lips oh my
god
so right now it's like a metallic lip is
so pigmented
Wow
I'm impressed that that was not streaky
at all so I'm trying to apply it without
rubbing my lips together because that's
when you're supposed to see the really
intense glitter I kind of feel in this
color so I applied it looks like a
metallic lip then it says press my lips
and I'm gonna slip out so I'm going from
this to this hopefully I don't a little
sounder me I mean I see what they're
talking about is so glittery and pretty
you see that it's so pretty I like it I
think these are cool I don't think
they're like as crazy as this picture is
like let's be real but it is really nice
and I like the shades in this I love
candy - I think Andy's gonna be so
pretty so moving on to things that is
not makeup and didn't got this al Genest
a liquid collagen and it just had like
really good reviews and I seems L genis
all the time and I loved them because I
love to their skincare products they
just worked so well for me this is
actually a bigger bottle than I expected
so this is what it looks like collagen
on lock for the first time al Jenna's
introduces liquid collagen a collagen
based formulation readily available for
youthful vitality collagen is the key
structural element and skins needs to
maintain a youthful appearance of skin
matures the production and availability
of collagen the most abundant protein in
the body responsible for skin elasticity
rapidly decreases so basically this is
supposed to unveil your most youthful
radiance with visibly refined smoother
skin texture I love that skin appears
firmer more tones visibly minimized the
fine lines and deep wrinkles in 10 days
Wow
so disaster cleansing and toning applied
entire face and then follow with your
moisturizer I'm interested to try this
out I mean I don't have a lot of like
deep wrinkles or anything but of course
you guys know I do have a lot of texture
and I'm always down to try new things to
help with that very excited to testers
now
I have high hopes for it so the other
center item I got is this shoe Shadow -
shadow quick matte moisturizer it's oil
free and its mass which I'm all about
the packaging is so different and cute
but I really love it so that's what it
looks like has like a nice pulling
sensation and it smells refreshing so
keep you guys updated again I love this
packaging so this lips dry matte and I
like it even more now okay and then two
more things I did get this bumble and
bumble bee BYU sleep overnight damage or
pair mask and basically its essence an
overnight treatment that helps reverse
the appearance of damaged hair it says
apply on dry hair once or twice a week
for deep nourishment leave on overnight
and then wash out with your favorite
shampoo and conditioner but I want to
try this out like try an overnight Mac
and see how that works we just gonna
have to really tie it up and keep it off
my back so I'm feeling it'll make me
break out I want to see what this smells
like
oh that smells so freakin good I'm going
to kind of play around with it and keep
you guys updated but I love the smell
the smell is what's really gonna make me
use it and pretty sure it likes it
floral or something online and I was
like um yes give it to me but I don't
like the smell of it I don't know what
it smells like but something about this
I just don't like so I will be returning
if this perfume it's not super floral or
anything I will leave the note down
below in the description box just a
quick little review I didn't like this
in the way it would work with me so I'll
be taking it that back so that is that
you guys is everything that I got from
Sephora and a couple PR items that I
want to share with you and try out as
always I will let you know what I think
I'm not too sure what I think about the
foundation just yet for primers so far I
feel like Smashbox is kind of winning
and I really like to concealer all that
kind of stuff so I will keep you guys
updated and I hope you enjoyed this try
on haul and I will see you guys in my
next video bye
wouldn't let you go if you left me
wouldn't let you go in stand-in on the
part I do you Domino I will let you know
through my brain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
