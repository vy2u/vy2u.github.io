to be sharing with you my Sephora haul
as well as items that I will be
returning so I thought this would be
kind of fun because I'm showing you
things that I've purchased some of them
I've tried and let you know my opinion
on and then I'm also sharing with you
guys things that I will be returning
they're gonna go back that's what I'm
gonna be sharing with you guys today I
really hope you guys enjoy this video if
you're wondering I just have red bandana
on and then this USA top from Miss
guided and my glow right now and we get
to it first things that I ordered a from
Sephora were new makeup bags and these
are just some travel makeup bags I'll
show you the other one in just a second
but I got this one first because I saw
Kathleen like to talk about it it just
looks super spacious which it is it's
pretty big this other one though when
you see it you're gonna be like oh my
gosh I have my other high-end makeup
bags I love but I also wanted something
that had compartments to that I can also
use for skin care this one when you open
it up it does have brushes and then you
have these little compartments in here
which I love these I probably should've
just got packing cubes instead of buying
all this I honestly I haven't decided if
I'm gonna keep this one just yet I might
return it because I have this other one
over here that is ginormous and would
fit literally everything and more like
probably all of my bath products and my
skin care and makeup in one bag this one
is probably gonna get returned I'll be
honest I do like the fact that it has
little cubes on the inside if you're
looking for something that's a little
bit smaller I think it would really like
this I mean it's a big bag but it's
smaller than what I'm about to show you
speaking of a sad bag this is the other
travel case I know I know it's huge bag
would definitely take up a whole section
of your suitcase also if you wanted to I
have another bandana in my head today
it's because I'm too lazy to carry two
first thing is something I've been
trying and really loving it's this
belief moisturizing eye balm and this is
what it looks like this had really great
reviews on Sephora and I wanted another
eye cream that was super moisturizing
I'm like really big on eye creams I love
trying new ones and finding like the
next best thing and this one had amazing
reviews and this is so good this is very
very hydrating it says that it provides
instant
sure 100% and it boosts elasticity his
IQ has been clinically tested to provide
up to 26 hours of moisture and improve
skin elasticity so I really do feel like
my under eyes are so incredibly
moisturized when using this product like
it really does last all day my makeup
looks amazing on top of it I don't feel
like my eyes are dry or anything like
that this is such a good eye cream I
think this might be my favorite one
absolutely loving this airing of another
eye cream so I purchased a different one
and I went with this and I have been
enjoying it so much let's talk about
something that is so expensive that the
reviews maybe buy it
it's the lemare the lifting and firming
mask I have also been using this as well
you get a lot of packaging for just a
little bit of product right there I will
say this smells really good it feels
really great on the skin I haven't
noticed the biggest difference just yet
I've used quite a bit of it too which is
kind of depressing I've been putting it
on my neck on my chest I do kind of feel
like it smooths out my neck quite a bit
as well as my face but I don't know if I
love this more than the Erno law is low
moisturizing mask which is way cheaper
than that it's not a cheap mask
whatsoever but it's way more affordable
than this one and it really just locks
in a moisture but this one's a firming
mask so I don't know I feel like I need
to use a little bit more because it's
not necessarily meant for just hydration
it's meant to firm and lift so I'm gonna
keep using this I'm probably honestly
gonna use it up and then let you guys
know what I think about it but so far
I'm on the fence like it does feel
really good but is it worth the price
because it is not cheap so next up I
have a repurchase this is the sol de
janeiro billion foreplay moisturizing a
shower cream gel this is really really
good I've been repurchasing this for a
while it smells delicious oh it smells
so good it really does moisturize the
skin nicely sometimes it's sold out and
it's hard to get your hands on but I
found it when I was making another order
and I snagged one up because I love this
body wash so much it's my favorite and
another thing that I got from the same
brand is what I have on my chest now and
I I think this is my new favorite body
product i'm sayyig low oil and you guys
this gives you a beautiful glow I wore
this the other night whenever I wore I
was like a jumpsuit out and I had one of
my light wash denim jackets over top and
I had put the highlighter everywhere
just in case I want to take it off I was
still glowing you know I put this all
over and they did not get on my jacket
oh it smells so good it smells like the
body wash and it is beautiful it gives
you like that natural looking glow like
it doesn't look like you put a ton of
makeup on your chest it just looks very
glowy and hydrated and that's what I
really love don't get me wrong I love a
good slick looking leg but for something
like when you're going out and about and
you're gonna be sweating and stuff this
is really good because I feel like it
would last all day but still give you
that glowy finish next thing is
something I need to do more research on
I have been using it and liking it but
wow I have used so much of this product
already I think I've had this for like a
week thank you guys I feel like I'm
think I'm using too much this is
expensive as well it's the facial
treatment essence I need to do more
research on essence I know I should've
done that before I brought the product
but it says that it's a skin balancing
essence you apply after cleansing you
saturate a comp ad and then put it on
your face and your neck I just put it on
my face I haven't been putting it online
that's really great packaging so far I
feel like my skin is really loving it my
skin is very hydrated my redness is
really starting to go down I think
that's mainly because I'm just taking
extra better care of my skin lately like
I'm really trying hard to make sure it's
nice and cleansed and refreshed I'm
doing a lot of masks and sheets as well
like sheet masks I think that has a lot
to do with my redness going down I'm
also going to the dermatologist at the
end of the month to see well we can do
about this but it doesn't really
bothered me that much I will update you
guys in my hits and misses video more
about this I know I'm coming to you with
like a half assed review but so far so
good doesn't bring me out makes my skin
look really good this is another body
product but I haven't not tried this yet
it's the Marc Jacobs dewdrops and this
is the coconut gel highlighter it's a
limited edition and it's e52 fantasy did
get a PR package with all this but I
also purchase it before that PR package
came because
I couldn't wait any longer so we
actually haven't tried this color Oh
little it just came off I love the other
one that they came out with last year I
actually have a couple of them so let's
just let's just see what it looks like
that lid just came right off tin it oh
this lid is broke that's not good I mean
this is mine but oh so I think I'm gonna
return this just because this is not one
to stay on like I thought pushing it
down would help but it's not wanting to
stay on at all so that's probably why
that would be going back but let's see
what this color looks like I thought it
was gonna be a little too dark for me
but we can see it's a little bit darker
yeah it has more of a tint you can kind
of see it right here like it's right
here and not in this area I personally
prefer the other shade for my skin tone
this one just looks a little bit red on
me like I had a little bit too much Sun
I am gonna be returning this one mainly
because of the packaging but I do think
the formula is really nice it's very
very shiny if that's what you're into
but I definitely prefer this one more
just cuz I like the color a little bit
better alright let's talk about perfumes
so I decided to try this new perfume
it's called fawn and it's the Ellis
Brooklyn fawn Oh de parfum this smells
like the beach it smells so good if you
loved the Tom Ford perfume I think it
was like the white bottle it was like so
a de Blanc or something like that
you would like this and I feel like this
lasts longer than that one pound for one
didn't really last that long on me at
all which was super annoying it was very
expensive but this one does last a bit
longer I like to just kind of spray this
all over it just gives you a really warm
summer scent that I love it's not super
sweet doesn't mind me so much of that
Tom Ford perfume but just a little bit
better and last longer so if you know
what that smells like and you like it
you would probably like this except I
did purchase this Marc Jacobs which you
guys have probably seen this before the
perfecting coconut setting powder I
really like this I have it on my face
right now
I love the tint of it kind of has like
that yellow tint there it does have a
net remind super dirty because I put my
sponge in there but it sets the makeup
beautifully it really makes your skin
look flawless it keeps you matte and
I've been
enjoying it so this is a great product
from Marc Jacobs so I decided it to
Amica products and this one is the Amika
per cup dry shampoo I just got the
sample size I tried this out the other
day and it wasn't the kind of dry
shampoo that I like I like a very
powdery dry shampoo something that's
really gonna soak up that oil in my hair
because I have an oily scalp my hair
gets super oily very quickly especially
with working out and you know now we're
getting into summer and when we sweating
more I don't think I like this just yet
I'm not gonna return it cuz it's a
sample size but I don't think I'm gonna
like this and I haven't tried this yet
but it's the volume powder spray and
we'll see how I like this is such cute
packaging they like very very cute it
says fill your hair with fat Matt volume
puff on for instant grip and then get
your hands into it watch your style grow
shake well aim for root for volume you
can apply mid link for a tussle toss a
little sex
I did try something like this from igk I
ended up well you'll see in a minute but
I'm gonna end up returning it because I
don't like it
mmm oh crap I just like opened it this
way and you're not supposed to do that
don't do that don't just do what I just
did yeah it does add some grit bad it's
not as like it's not as like sticky as
the igk one that I tried which is nice
but it does have that grit to it like
that really dirty hair but it does give
you nice volume if you like volumizing
powders I think you would like this I am
gonna keep it just because I think I
just wasted half the product such cute
packaging and it's not as intense as the
other one like this feels pretty good I
can deal with this also got two perfumes
from this brand it's by Rosie Jane and I
got James and Tilly first off the name
got me because it's Rosie you know let
my Rosie this wasn't the scent James
this smells really good it smells
it's not sweet this one just smells like
a classic scent to me I don't know I
can't stop describing thing James I
really like James more than I do Tilly I
will say that yeah Tilly's a little bit
too Tilly's a little too mature for me
at this moment I like James better so
Tilly will be going back but I will be
keeping James I do like the fact that
they're a spray it travel perfume
because I hate roller balls so much
moving on to the next product this is
something I have not tried yet but I
think would be a really great product to
incorporate into my hair care routine
this is the I believe it's called
chlorine-chlorine sun radiance
protective oil and it's for sun exposed
hair which you guys know I love to go to
the lake so it says all over dry or damp
hair reapply as needed before during
after sun exposure so you could like
take this to Lake and spray it all over
your hair if you wanted to or the beach
it says multi protecting UV salt
chlorine a deeply nourishing color
protecting waterproof silicone free so I
just thought this would be a great
barrier product for the spring and
summertime if you're out and about and
the pool and the leg and the beach I
think this is something that would be
great to incorporate into your hair care
routine so I'm gonna try it out and see
how I like it I've got a Cabo trip
coming up with Davis and I'm so excited
about and I think my hair is gonna go
through it so we'll see we'll use that
up I did a purchase these Sunday Riley
the influencer clean long wear
foundation I will be returning the
foundations that I got from this line I
don't like this foundation at all I
think I'm gonna do a wear test before I
actually return the product just so I
can share with you guys why I don't like
it I did include this in a previous
video and you got to see it on my face
and you could see why I didn't like it
it just does not last throughout the day
it breaks up on my forehead so bad it is
definitely not a full coverage product
like I feel like you cannot build this
up to be full coverage it's definitely
more light to medium yeah just not not a
favorite and I haven't returned a
foundation in a while but I'm returning
this one I do not like it at all the
repurchase is my Donna Karen at cashmere
mist deodorant I love this deodorant
it's an antiperspirant love this
deodorant I also love a CREZ deodorant
that I have it's really really good it's
aluminum free this one does have
aluminum I probably should wean off of
this again
use at your own risk last thing I'm
keeping in this makeup bag that I'm
showing you is the callee contour from
Smashbox I didn't get this in PR and
I've been really wanting to try it I was
kind of just waiting to see if I'd get
it but you know this is why I always
purchase things and then I get a PR and
then I just give that away because I'd
rather just purchase it myself because I
know I'm gonna have it but this is
really cute it just looks like this and
you have a really great big mirror this
is like a nice quality palette and then
you have some contour shades some
highlight something to brighten up the
under eye and it just looks really
pretty in this blush looks so nice - I
just really like all the colors in here
and I really love this palette so it
looks very very pretty and I love how
compact it is I kind of thought it would
be bigger but I like this size one quick
thing I did get a huda beauty package
and she sent over a few of her new items
so I'm just gonna share this one with
you because this one was when I was
gonna purchase but I dig it in PR it's
the hood of beauty coral obsessions and
these are her little mini palettes these
colors are just so pretty
did you guys see that she revamped her
rose gold palette like now I feel like
I'm gonna have to get rid of mine and
get the new one cuz I feel like it's
gonna be ten times better I'm gonna
purchase her new formula palette and see
the difference between the two because
I'm very interested to see you like
because I remember when I first tried it
I didn't like the shimmer shades so they
had these on with my finger now I use
things with my fingers all the time
because of hooda but now she's changing
it on me so I got it I gotta figure it
out so once you get everything out of
this makeup bag and this is what it
looks like I don't quite understand
these but I mean I'll keep them in here
mainly this one I'll probably toss this
guy to be honest with you but you do
have like two of these packs you have
one on this side one on this side you
also have some stretchy compartments
here and again you do have like a brush
set up here that you can put in here but
it is huge so I'm going to keep this one
I think I'm gonna return the other one
because there's no sense in keeping two
of them okay guys let's talk about what
I'm returning so you guys already know
I'm returning the Sunday Riley
Foundation and then this Tilly Rosie
Jane perfume but I'm also gonna return
this as well like I had mentioned
earlier it's the igk 30,000 feet volume
powder spray again just too sticky it
was just too too
dirty for me that's gonna go as well as
this palette oh my gosh I don't know if
I've talked about this before because
these products are pretty old for me
I've been waiting to return them just
cuz I want to do a video I just vices
palette it's the medallist high shine a
bouncy cream eyeshadow palette by touch
and soul I don't like this all I did
talk about this cuz I talked about the
price and how much I didn't like it so
this is going back it's expensive it
feels like a literally five dollar
palette mine are super dry they don't
work on my eyes at all like look at that
eye I expected so much more from these
but once you put them on your eyes they
kind of just sheer out and they're just
not what I expected so these are going
back
I just remembered now and I'm talking
about it that I did talk about this and
did not like it at all I'm also
returning my anastacio powder bronzer in
rich amber my shade is rosewood I do
have rosewood on my face right now to
bronze but rich amber was definitely too
dark nothing wrong with this powder at
all just not my shade
I will also be returning the Locke suit
on hold your thirst quenching gel and
its daily hydration a thirst quench now
I love luck suit on so much you guys
know they have my favorite body butter
ever if you are dry you better get it
you ready to get it cuz you'll be smooth
as all get-out and it will last all day
long but this I was really excited about
because I thought okay I love that and
then I love gel moisturizers because
they're not super greasy they're not
heavy but this didn't feel like it
moisturize my skin much at all like I
didn't feel like my skin was plum bike
for my moisturizers to not be heavy but
I still want that deep moisturize
feeling you know what I'm saying am I
making sense do you like a lot of gel
moisturizers this one just wasn't my
favorite I feel like it was a little too
drying if anything like it just wasn't
enough moisture for me so I'm gonna have
to return this as well I will also be
returning a chance Chanel a body oil I
thought since this is a body oil this is
going to last all day you know this does
not last on me at all so I am returning
this it's a beautiful beautiful scent
but I need long-lasting products if I'm
purchasing Chanel stuff I need it to
last all day long and then the last one
that Davis is very upset about because
I've gone back and forth of this you
guys know if you watched one of my hits
and misses videos I mentioned this Davis
loves this perfume
I cannot do it I cannot do it and it was
so expensive to see Killian a good girl
gone bad I told you guys about those
reviews and about how people were like
oh man love this set I'm like yes I'm
gonna get it
David's gonna love it oh I don't know
man he like I'm not kidding he is
obsessed with this set he doesn't
understand why I'm returning it because
I was putting on Gucci Guilty and he's
like what about that other one I'm like
but this one smells amazing and he's
like I like that other one the most out
of all your perfumes and I'm just like
what do we smell different there's
something like we're not on the same
page with this scent at all I just can't
do it I just feel like if I spent this
much money on it I need to use it every
single freaking day and I just can't do
it I can't do it so it's going back
I'm sorry killing it does work guys like
it a lot but me okay guys so that is it
