another Sephora haul for you this thing
is heavy and I told you guys in my last
one that I had another order coming and
this is it this is it for a while and I
figured instead of showing you guys like
I did in my last one like you're showing
each product that I would try some this
on for you so I make it at Sephora try
on haul that's what we're going to do
today we're going to kind of just go
through the box see what we can try out
on our face today I don't think that
have any eye shadows in here do I
no but I have a new concealer and
foundation new primers I have a new
contour palette anyone just do like a
lighter makeup look no eye shadow just
mascara and try out some other products
that I've been wanting to test that as
well
also before we get started don't forget
to subscribe don't forget that my
palettes are on sale my highlight
palettes with Smashbox I will have them
linked down below where you can get them
to be available in stores at Sephora and
a line on March 3rd and I'll leave the
other days for Macy's and open and all
of that down below yes
be sure to check that out let's go ahead
and get started ok so the first thing I
got was a div Rouge pouch actually kind
of forgot what this was I don't really
remember what it is oh it's the little
before of the IV Rouge a lip brush is a
pro mini flawless airbrush so it's just
a little mini brush for vib Rouge
members I also got let's try this out
right now I got this way dry shampoo I
have heard so many people talk about
this and I've been intrigued and I
really wanted to try it so what did I
test this out and see if it works really
well to take my wings off real quick
just by Jen Atkin and she does she's
really well known for doing the
Kardashian's hair this is a really cool
product I normally used batiste which is
a lot more floral than this but if you
do try it out because it looks like a
cool product here's a little bit shiny
it's only the like first day after I
wash my hair but I always like to put a
little bit dry shampoo and just to
control the oils a little nervous I was
a little nervous I'm always nervous
trying out a new dry shampoo because
they can either grow really well or
Dover that and this is a mousse so I'm
very nervous but the packaging is really
nice I love how simple and sleek it is
all right that's a little loose I was
expecting like a loose oh this is just a
dry shampoo
this is not one or two try forgot I
purchase both so let me get the mousse
real quick and this is what I thought I
was going to try the dry shampoo foam
this one has like a little group blue
lining around it the other one has
silver so we're going to try out the
mousse because I know how this works
I'll just keep you guys updated if it's
actually good hit restart for real with
this unique foaming dry shampoo it works
without water to thoroughly cleanse and
refresh hair while adding instant volume
and just shower shine and just showered
shine for use on dry hair dirty hair
take it up work a palm full of product
into your hair and scalp and reapply as
needed again with the packaging very
very pretty I just love the simplicity
of it very pretty oh my god I'm so
nervous just too much oh my god I feel
like my hair is wet from the shower
oh my god oh my god he's going to keep
working it it's adding a lot of volume
it seems but I'm sorry and also much
product really crazy
you guys saw how wet my hair look it
smells so good I mean it kind of feels
oily but it gave lots of volume so I'm
interested to see how this is going to
work with super oily hair I still like
the effect of the batiste a little bit
more just because it doesn't give this
really product II I don't know I don't
know how to describe it it doesn't feel
oily this kind of feels smooth see in
your hair you know it sounds really dull
but it definitely feels very Lucy okay
so moving on to the rest of the haul I
got a new perfume I wanted to try this
is the Daisy Marc Jacobs kit and it's a
limited edition fragrance perfume is
always a hard thing to buy online but I
really rely on reviews them being
florals usually the floral perfume I
like it the limited edition packaging
nothing like that and I don't think I'm
gonna like that it's not kind of citrusy
and like a not the floral that I like
I'll try it on my body but so far I
don't think I'm liking it so I also I'll
show you guys my repurchase real quick I
purchased the inner laws low food and
calm since this cleansing oil I love
this I'm officially out of it so I
needed a new bottle and then I also
repurchase my lock seat on ultra rich
body cream and this is amazing I've also
been using my Clinique body butter I
needed something a little bit thicker
and a little bit more hydrating and this
is like my go-to from when I'm feeling
very very dry so again just be lucky con
ultra rich body cream and then we have
have any other repurchases in here I
think that's it oh now I did repurchase
the Smashbox Studios skin concealer in
light neutrals I also purchased another
Make Up For Ever HD I forgot that I had
purchases in this haul so when I got it
in store I didn't realize it but I also
got this so we'll see what color mass is
set I got the Make Up For Ever matte
velvet plus for my throwback throw down
series so stay tuned for that
the shade 45 for when I'm really nice in
self-tan but yeah you can really tell
the color in here but it's a nice dark
color and these to use this total long
ago so stay tuned for throwback
throwdowns I did try this poor Festing
white charcoal mattifying treatment
primer yesterday on my facebook live and
I really liked it so I'm going to save
this and let you guys know I'll update
you then but for now I'm going to try
out this do your skin's forever and ever
wear face good tint is this extreme
perfection and hold make up base that's
what it looks like we all know this is
parsley tail because your look weighs
good and it's a pretty tiny bottle
luckily this is the primer and on a
foundation but it has one fluid ounce in
it and it says just shake well we're
going to go ahead and shake it oh came
out like that came out all over the
bottle and lid we're just going to
squeeze some out wrote two fingers and
put it on my face oh yeah that mattifies
the skin really nicely so three
different foundations I can trial I have
the girl on Paris lingerie PO natural
perfecting foundation also purchased
this Giorgio will show you our money
power fabric long wear high coverage
foundation and then I also have this
Burberry cashmere long-lasting flawless
soft matte foundation do you want to try
the Burberry ones because they've been
really into it I think the packaging is
gorgeous and I just really isn't wanting
to try this out for a long time this one
is in the shade honey and it's one fluid
ounce when you open up the box the first
flap says I guess to shake and then the
next flap says to twist the top on or
off what okay this is the foundation
right yes the directions say reapply at
least every two hours use a water
resistant sunscreen is swimming or
sweating I'm not going to in the
foundation on and then it says apply
liberally 15 minutes before sun exposure
children only six months of age ask a
doctor okay this is what C foundation
looks like or the packaging so you take
that off and you have the pump this is a
really hefty lid by the way it's very
nice quality to that squirt it out on my
hand you gotta take the word sport so
that's to show you honey
and kind of runny let me screen you my
L'Oreal sponge
I want to how much I need that I know I
just put too much on my hand you're just
going to woo hmm the shade look very
warm the shade is definitely off yes not
going to work not Network so we're going
to take this one off all right moving on
we got two more foundations we can try
we have the girl on lingerie Depot and
number 30 natural maybe this this is a
little bit nicer see like it looks
really dark down here but if I had like
a light reflector you would see it's not
that arc is a very nice glass bottle it
looks very luxurious and pretty and it
says natural perfection foundation put
SPF 20 take the top off and you have a
pump this is a Randi foundation very
runny okay down with that L'Oreal sponge
I just took off the other foundation
this seems like a really thin foundation
this sounds like a lot too light
huh oh I'll in a really long way
surprisingly alright doesn't want to too
long I can just bronze with it most of
you know I love applying my foundations
of the sponge so that's how I normally
do it unless stated differently this
one's very easily and it feels really
lightweight and it actually feels kind
of hydrating on the skin which is nice
it also makes me nervous for how it's
going to wear that's that it looks
really refreshing and pretty kind of
digging it so far and then I also
purchased the NARS soft matte complete
concealer and I got the shade medium one
custard comes in packaging like this
which is very very pretty that's the
product right there so I'm going to play
it with a brush on this side and then
blend it out with a Beauty Blender and
see how it looks
colors not bad but it's not super
highlighted like I normally like that's
okay take my sponge and blend this out I
do like to do the triangle shape
underneath my eyes blend it out very
easily that's one side done it did cover
some darkness that I have and use my
finger as much as I can because they do
have nails so I can't do my finger in
there I'm just gonna blend this out okay
so it feels really lightweight and it
looks really nice on the skin especially
with this foundation we're going to set
with a different powder today if you
follow me on my facebook and you saw my
facebook live the other night you saw it
because I really liked that powder right
now very easy to blend out and it feels
so good on the skin doesn't feel heavy
or anything so Mike it's been so long
since I've tried out new high-end
products so now I'm going to set my
under eyes and the rest of my face will
not rest my face just my under eyes on
my t-zone why put concealer with the Kat
Von D brightening powder in petal she
has three different shades of it and
it's supposed to be like a really
smoothing powder for your under eyes and
the everything kind of blurred out and
beautiful I did really like this when I
use this on my facebook live so as I'm
using it again like I said there are
three shades I don't remember the exact
colors but I did go with petal and now
I'm going to go ahead and move on to
brows I'm going to do those off-camera
but I am using anis Fiona styles brow
sculpting wax and I really really like
this right now this is what I'm going to
use real quick and then I'll be back to
do some more first impressions for you
guys and now I'm back my brows are done
look a little dark but I'm going to go
ahead and take my brush and I'm just
going to just powder away have glitter
all in my eyes powder is so pretty
very very smooth on the skin look at
that this powder concealer and the
foundation combo is looking really nice
so I got a new bronzer this is HD
offtake bamboo bronzer is a long way of
bronzing powder this is the shade Palm
Island so the packaging looks like very
sleek and pretty this is the powder this
looks like a nice color for me right now
put on to skin seems like a really
pretty smooth bronzer just applying
really well and it looks really natural
it's definitely a buildable bronzer at
least this shade I really like the color
not too intense I did get the Sephora
palette the contour palette but they
have this is all too much as my shirt so
this is before contour palette
and has six shades in here so it looks
like it looks very pretty I like the
clear front and then this is the inside
I'm going to go for this one right here
to contour my face so I'm also going to
use the things you can use this Real
Techniques brush this is the setting
brush and contour
I like that shade it's very a she so it
just looks like a nice shadow and take
my NARS eita brush in that same color
and see if I like it just a little bit
more just see if it blends out a little
bit better that dark run this out credit
it blends right this lemons harsh think
dinars eat a brush picked up a lot of
products so we're should be here for a
second not the easiest to blend out it's
not blending out very easily on this
side at all like there's this one area
that's just too dark course controlled
it because I can't take it off right to
help and then I'm going to take this
smaller brush which is what I've been
using the contour recently and when you
use that same color and contour my nose
oh this is not easy to blend out okay
now what I'm going to do is I'm actually
just going to take the end of this
Beauty Blender and kind of go over these
areas to try to make it look a little
bit better especially windows I mean
this guy looks really good this side I
can't get it to blend out and look any
better like it's just looking huh
so I am going to add blush I'm just
going to use this Tarte risque blush
which is one of my favorites I really
really like this color
and then I'm going to go in with my gold
palette you guys wouldn't want me to use
it so I'm about to use it now I'm
actually going to do a full video on
this like a makeup tutorial using it
just stay tuned for that but I'm just
going to mix these two because this
one's a little too dark for me right now
and McPhee's klenda that gold highlight
oh my gosh so beautiful when I mix the
first shade and then the middle shade it
does just lighten it up a little bit
which is good for me right now and then
that's what you get
very pretty good that contour is so dark
oh let me try out a new mascara for me
at least it's the torch tourist lash
paint mascara and black I want to try
this out and I think it's perfect time
because we're not doing any eyeshadow
which is probably a good thing since
you're like this video is so long right
now whoo whoo I love wands like this so
this is what the wand looks like there
it is right there
I love wands like this so now I'm like
super pumped I'm gonna curl my lashes
real quick very voluminous and the
bristles are separating my lashes really
nicely and there's little ones on the
end to get in the outer part whoo whoo I
like that I don't know if you guys can
see but it looks really nice and I'm
going to go in with the new bite Beauty
that pencils number 10 these came so
sharp in like for real they were sharp
I'm gonna find this liquid lip again
I've been applying it a lot lately just
because I love it but it's the Urban
Decay liquid lip in Vice it's just such
a pretty color and I really love the
formula of these really like the way
that makeup turned out the highlight
like this tie my face looks good this
contour turned out a little bit better
this I don't look good well just look at
the side for now I will have a wear test
for you guys on this foundation and this
concealer let me know if you want them
together again like I did in this video
or separate videos trying this out with
different foundations or if you just
want to wait and me include this in
favourites video I will and wear test
consists of me using this a few times
then coming on camera and being like
alright you guys are going to watch me
you wear this throughout the day and
that's usually how it goes so I
definitely want to do that with this
foundation I'm really really liking it
so far I think everything looks
beautiful and in the wrap of this video
I'm going to show you the rents and
stuff I got it's just four items got
this uni flashback no wrist body
cleanser instantly bones away sweat dirt
and odor now I know you're probably
thinking let grow you don't want to
shower no I do I want to shower everyday
but you know there's some days where
like if when you go into the gym you
don't necessarily want to take a shower
before the gym because you know you're
going to take one after these you're
like you need a refresher before the gym
that's what I'm going to use this for
I'm interested to see how well this will
work like if you're someone who is on
the go working 9 to 5 and like on your
lunch break you go to the gym and you
want to you know touch up for this
afterwards so you don't smell I think
that would be a really cool product so
we'll see if this works out and then I
also got the cover FX perfect setting
powder I wanted to try this out I have a
lot of translucent powers too I have a
lot of translucent powers to test out
actually pink powers I have a lot of
translucent power pack vol like y'all a
lot of translucent powders to try out
for you guys and then I got this hair
and body refresher from philosophy to
pure grace swimmer sir I'm not going to
lie I haven't smelt this yet oh yeah
summertime oh my gosh oh that's going to
be amazing in the summertime I am so
excited to have this oh it smells like
summer that's just what it smells like
smells like suntan lotion a beach some
coconut smells delicious so I'm excited
for this I don't think I'm a fan of the
pure grace scent but this one I guess
because it's the summer surge yes so
good and then the last thing that I got
to try out for you is I love to Grand
Isle Jenna so when I saw this I knew I
had tried out the pore corrector
anti-aging primer and it is a pore
crafter so I'm all about that life but
so far I mean the Dior one I think
everything the face makeup right now is
just looking really good - my contour
really excited to test this out for you
guys this is what it looks like and it's
a little too right here definitely let
me know in the comments if you've tried
any of this stuff if there's something
you want a specific review on I will do
that for you all these people look out
for my monthly hits and this is because
a lot of products are usually in there
either omission or in the mister
after I use them for a while thank you
guys so much for watching and I will see
you all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
