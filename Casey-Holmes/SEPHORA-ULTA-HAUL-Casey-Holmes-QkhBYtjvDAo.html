today I am doing a is Sephora and Ulta
haul and I got a bunch of stuff and I
wanted to share with you guys and I know
I've done a few hauls these past couple
weeks past you guys on snapchat by the
way I created a new snapchat if you
haven't checked it out
I've been snapping every single day so
if you haven't seen it I will leave my
snapchat name right here go check it out
I would love for you to follow but I
asked you guys if you want to see it you
said yes and I did just film a video
using new products as well and I just
decided that I'm not gonna include them
in this haul since you will see them in
their own separate video of me trying
all of these out I have 11 products that
I just filmed with that were like first
impressions and like just seeing
highlights them I figured just to kind
of cut this video down a little bit cuz
there's a lot of stuff that I would just
leave those out for that video and you
could check that one out as well so it's
kind of like a haul first impression and
that one so I'm just gonna get started
with Sephora first thing is actually
something I tried today this is the
Sephora color switch by Vera Mona and it
says it's a knit top it says it
instantly removed shadow color from oh
my god says that it instantly removes
shadow color from makeup brushes I've
seen a few people talk about this and
I've kind of just been like I hate
washing my brushes and if there's
something invented where you don't have
to go wash some of your eye brushes and
I'm all about that so I don't recommend
not washing your brushes by the way
definitely wash them but for like
traveling or just if you don't have
enough time to wash your eye brushes
this works I used it and I loved it all
you do is just take your brush and you
swivel it around in here and it takes
off all that excess color it's not
something that's going to deeply
penetrate the bristles and get all of
that color out in that bacteria but this
does get that color out so if you have
one shade that you just use and you want
to use a different one just swirl it in
here put it in the other one and you are
good to go so I think this is awesome
and it does work because I just used it
if you follow me on snapchat you know I
have been wanting this perfume and I've
just been eyeing it and I hate to say
isn't that my cup of tea doesn't smell
good
to me I want to try the new Gucci one
the new Gucci floral one because I love
floral perfumes sadly this wouldn't work
for me I loved this Marc Jacobs Daisy
perfume this one was amazing I don't
like the original Daisy I know it's
weird
this one smells so good I didn't like
blush I hated it
I also renewed my vib Rouge and they
gave like a little NARS blush in here
but it's in the color go Louie I don't
know that's a really pretty mom okay so
this I have on my eyes right now if you
watched my I think it was my last
Sephora haul I mentioned these they're
the velour fluff and wispy lashes these
are my Holy Grail I love them I would
buy their whole stock if I knew that
they were going to be discontinued
because I love these they're so fluffy
and wispy that's why they're called
fluff and wisp ins and they're just so
much thicker than their original lashes
you have to try these if you have not
tried them out you need to because they
are so stunning and I feel like they go
with any look I could wear them for
something really natural or something
like today where I went a little bit
more dramatic so pretty I am on the hunt
for the perfect green corrector for
redness you guys know I have rosacea and
I'm just on the hunt now to find the
perfect one so I'm not gonna swatch all
these but I'm just gonna show you which
ones I got by the way I do have the YSL
one and I will include that in the video
um not a big fan of it I'll just tell
you right now so far I'm not a big fan I
do like a full review of all these green
concealers I will let you know which one
is best so you can save your money and
just get one of them or if they all suck
I'll let you know that too
but first I got these Sephora brands is
the bright future one in green I also
got the Urban Decay and naked skin I'm
so excited about this one and this is
the green as well and I love that I've
indicated concealer so I am hoping that
this is just as beautiful as that I
cannot wait to try it
got the Marc Jacobs one as well this is
the Marc Jacobs cover stick and cover
affairs number 300 so this one's
definitely different than all the other
ones and you just twist it up and it
comes out like that I can't wait to try
it because it's very interesting and I
like
stick form that you can just like put it
on and be good to go really like Marc
Jacobs native to Marc Jacobs does have
really great makeup and then I tried
something from Lancome this is the
miracle cushion in number zero one three
so it's kind of like a cushion
foundation but it's a corrector I love
that it's you can't really see it
because the lighting but it's like a
light matte green on top I love that so
it just looks like a cushion foundation
and it's gonna be green on the inside I
can't wait to try it I love it they did
that so you know it's a green corrector
that's awesome okay so wrapping up the
rest of Sephora I did get this milk
makeup concealer never tried this brand
before but this just looks so cool it's
in the shade light and it just looks
like this this is a very creamy
concealer i swatched it when I first got
this and I'm excited it has more of a
pink undertone which I mean sometimes I
am will just have to see but it blends
in really well so I cannot wait to see
how this works I like that it's a stick
form so you could just go right
underneath your eyes and like take a
Beauty Blender or blush blush then you
can take a Beauty Blender or a brush to
blend it out and then I just have
another set of the fluff and whispies I
bought three pairs okay so crazy I'm
about them and then I bought this backup
ultimate coverage concealer but I bought
it and the wrong shade this is not my
shade this isn't the color banana then
hang a work for me that's too light so I
need to go up a shade or two I think I'm
gonna go into an Ulta and just find my
shade that way I really want to try this
so if you have tried this concealer let
me know if you like it I'm actually
trying a new concealer right now and you
guys will see how I feel about it in
that video but I'm hoping this one will
be really good as well although that
also puts all your makeup products in
like a little bag makes it so easy to
hold okay so the first thing I want to
talk about is something I am a
definitely returning because this was
expensive and the smell so this is the
girl on Shalimar perfume dusting powder
and I got this because it was supposed
to be like floral and just sexy
and just I don't know I just like a
dusting powder you could just all over
your body and just smell good now is all
about that but guys this is just way too
mature of a scent for me I was thinking
more of like a light floral set you know
nothing too crazy but that is definitely
much more mature than I thought it was
gonna be so I'm gonna return this
because it wasn't cheap and I'm not
gonna use it at all because it won't it
won't go with any perfumes that I have
so yeah that one is going back this I'm
really excited about I don't think I've
ever told you guys I hate these lines on
my neck they just seem to get worse and
worse as they get older and I always try
to make sure I moisturize that area so I
can like keep it from getting worse
but I got these and I know you can't
reverse what's already been done unless
you get a little but otherwise I don't
even know if you could do Botox in your
neck if you do that but anyways I
thought I would use this to try to keep
that area moisturized so it doesn't get
more lines and this is the rodeo neck
mass it says freeze and smooth tint skin
tightening and hydrating bio cellulose
mask with cynic oh my god you're
supposed to have a clean neck put it on
leave it on for I think it's 20 to 30
minutes yes and then peel it away and
then rub in the rest of the product so I
will let you guys know in like a
favourites video if I like this or not
I've never tried a neck mask
I've tried sheet masks before but okay
if it helps they help and then I did get
a NYX brush I saw a lot of NYX brushes
online and they looked really good but
this is just the one I wanted to try
first and what is this called it's just
called the o4 brush it's really soft and
it's shedding already no it's just a
nice duo fiber brush I figured maybe for
like underneath the eyes or something
like that or even like a cream contour
it would be really good and it has a
really sleek handle and just the
packaging in general is really sleek so
hoping this is good it's shedding but
it's okay
got this free Tarte Amazonian clay
finishing powder with this purchase
which I feel like is a really good size
this is just one of the reasons why I
love Ulta because they do stuff like
this they just
presents for buying expensive stuff this
is the tarte high-performance empowered
hybrid gel foundation i got the color
medium honey i think this will be good
for me like on spring break or a little
bit after spring break but the reason i
got is because it said it was a gel
foundation and I really like gel
products for my skin especially just
having oily skin yeah I mean this
packaging is gorgeous and I've already
kind of messed it up on the inside but
this is this is what it looks like
oh yeah Mama's gonna have to get a
little more tan and then I have four
more products for you guys but the first
one is this NYX glitter primer and I've
just heard great things about this
I love these two-faced I feel like I'm
talking really fast I'm sorry
I love the Too Faced glitter glue primer
it is my holy girl I've been using it
for years but I've heard great things
about this as well and I'm all for
trying new things that are more
affordable and I love this packaging I
wanted the white one so bad but they
were sold out so I'm gonna have to try
to find it but this is the NYX Pro
foundation mixer and this is the warm
one I love this okay sometimes like my
Marc Jacobs foundations they're very
yellow tone and sometimes they need to
be a little bit more warmed up when I
have a tan going on and this is gonna be
perfect for that I feel like I'm so
excited to try it it's just this just
helps you customize your shade so you
can make it more warm and then they have
the white one where you can lighten
foundations so I want the white one and
then of course now I have this one which
I'm just so pumped about so I cannot
wait and then I also got this HD
finishing powder and for a little sneak
peak I did try to eat banana powder of
this in my video I just did and I loved
it I think I'm gonna love this just as
much because this one was really smooth
and really fine and it blended in so
well and just created a really soft
focused finish I think this is gonna be
just as great and I'm all about
translucent powders I stick them things
I stick them things at my grammar
I stick translucent powders in every
single purse so like if I talk about
translucent powder and I'm like I love
it and you don't see it for a few months
it's because it's in one of my clutches
and I haven't found
and then I got this shea moisture
mineral powder blush and peach coral
this is a smallest little blush ever but
I love this color this is like my kind
of color so I wanted to give this shot
Oh Fort Knox all up on this thing Oh
kind of gives me Becca packaging vibes
like their blush packaging just a lot
smaller so that's what it looks like oh
it's gonna be a good blush you guys
that's it that's gonna be it I'm gonna
love this color it's really smooth to
sit - it smells like play-doh don't
bother me I like play-doh that's a kid
but I think I'm really gonna like this
because this is my kind of color I love
these coral peachy shades for summer
especially with a tan and it looks like
it blends out really well so I can't
wait to play with that and that is it
for this haul guys I hope you enjoyed it
