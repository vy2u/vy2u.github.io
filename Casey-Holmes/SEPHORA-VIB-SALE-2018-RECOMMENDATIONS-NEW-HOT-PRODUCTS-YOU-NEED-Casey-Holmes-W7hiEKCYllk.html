be sharing with you my Sephora VIP cell
recommendations I had a lot of you
requests for me to do this I feel like
you guys requested every time that the
sale comes around because it's only
twice of the year this one coming up is
15% so like in the springtime it's
always 15 and then later in the year
because there's a link to it is 20%
which we all prefer the 20% lets you
roll but 15% is still something off of
all these products at Sephora so I
picked some of my favorites at the
moment also some classic products that
you know I just can't shut up about so
yeah I have some new things in here too
that I haven't mentioned to you guys
that I've been trying lately really
loving and I'm excited to share all
these products with you so these are
ones that I think are amazing and you
should definitely spend your money on
also if you're wondering I'm wearing
this denim crop top and I feel like my
boobs look funny because it's denim like
this crop top is like tight to my body
so it's like squishing my boobs in so I
feel like I need to like contour these
or something but yeah my boobs are like
to my chest but I'm wearing a denim crop
top because I'm obsessed with denim I'm
so happy it's a thing if I can find this
on revolve only get down below I know
there was like limited available last
time I purchased it aside small it's
like the most comfortable crop top even
though my boobs are like squish it's
kind of nice it's kind of nice I'm so
ready for spring and summer because I'm
ready to wear stuff like this and like
high-waisted denim with these cute crop
tops but we just had a nice storm so I
mean spring will be here sometime you
guys are excited for this video I
definitely let me know down below what
you're picking up from the vib cell if
you're going to shop it and get that 15%
off definitely interested in hearing
what you guys think don't forget to
subscribe before you leave and also hit
that post notification bell so you know
when I upload so if you want to see all
the products that I recommend then let's
just go ahead and get started first
thing I want to talk about is this
diffuser if you follow me on Instagram
and like watch my Instagram stories I
have mentioned this before this is the
Jo Malone red roses diffuser and oh oh
my gosh I've actually had this as fuser
downstairs in our cabinets with our
candles for the longest time I just
never opened it up for some reason even
though I bought it cuz it's red roses I
love floral you guys know this I don't
know why I just didn't open it up I
think because I purchased some other
ones before this at Neiman Marcus that
were so expensive and they're awesome
it's actual
to the fuser that is back here the antic
afar Pharma Sita I don't know it's this
little fancy brand and these are awesome
they last a really long time I'm one of
those people that puts all the wakes in
their diffusers so a lot of people don't
recommend that but I do because why not
I do love that diffuser back there but
this diffuser is so strong put it in our
bedroom and it smelt up the whole entire
upstairs that's amazing so once I put
this out and figured out how intense it
was because sometimes diffusers are a
hit miss you know I bought a bunch more
and I have one downstairs and I also
have a backup as well like I said I do
put all the wicks in there because I
want the strongest stem possible just
kind of make it go down a little bit
faster but I really you know I'm getting
my use out of it so I really don't care
it's definitely go get your 15% off if
you're wanting to try a new diffuser or
something that is really gorgeous
and that really does smell up the entire
floor like this is amazing I love so
much I can't say enough good things
about it and it just looks really pretty
as well it's like classic Joe Malone it
comes in a gorgeous packaging it's just
like a luxurious present that you're
giving yourself and I love it it's also
great for a gift if you know someone who
loves florals and it's their birthday or
something I highly recommend though I'm
saying I recommend to you guys is Dior
hide your life and my cellar milk no
rinse cleanser now when I got this I
found it so interesting I was like no
rinse cleanser what and you can actually
take off all your makeup with this your
eye makeup your face makeup all that but
I don't use it for that just because I
personally love my Clinique take off the
day cleansing balm which you could also
get it for 15% off a Sephora but I've
mentioned it so many times that I
figured I would keep it out of this
video I personally love this for like if
I wake up and I wash my face in the
morning but I don't put on makeup
throughout the day and then I'm getting
ready for bed and I need to wash my face
but I don't feel like I have to wash it
I'll use this to just get all that dirt
and grime off my face it just got on
throughout the day all the bacteria and
I'll also do it in the morning too if I
just don't feel like washing my face I
would do something like this because
that way you're still cleansing your
skin but you're not like having to do
all the water and all the extra stuff
especially if you wake up and you're
about to go to the gym and you're gonna
have to wash your face a little bit
later anyways I think this is a great
alternative is a huge bottle it is six
point seven fluid ounces and I find that
it really makes my skin super super saw
it doesn't strip my skin
any moisture anything like that and it
does take a lot of dirt up I just use
like a cotton round and just go all over
my face I actually do about two cotton
rounds and it gets everything off and I
feel really nice and cleansed when I use
this so I just think it's cool I haven't
ever had anything like this and I saw no
Sephora and thought why not try it I
even use this the other night before I
used a self-tanner on my face because I
was like well I'm about to put self
tanner on my face so I don't really want
to like wash and put water all over my
skin so I just used this I love this for
like the convenience part of it I know
you can get like micellar water at like
the drugstore Garnier and all of that
but I like this because it's still
pretty hydrating and leaves your skin
really nice and smooth I tried it and I
loved it and if you want to try it I
definitely recommend it and get that 15%
off your you know also I want to shout
out the YSL mom pony perfume guys this
smells so good this is my second bottle
of this stuff it is hard for me to go
through bottles of perfume like I'm
looking at it right now and I have a lot
just because I love perfumes I love
smelling different since I just highly
recommend it I always get compliments
when I wear it it lasts on me throughout
the day which I am obsessed with and
honestly if I could have this like in a
shampoo conditioner I would be all about
it now we're moving on to these Smashbox
primer water you guys already know I
love this this is awesome if you have
oily skin I love to use this as a primer
I put it on before my other primers so
normally I do two primers so I applied
this one first and I feel like it just
really refreshes the skin hydrates it
and like preps everything for makeup and
then I go in with more of like a pore
filling one that's like going to make me
really nice and smooth or control my oil
honestly this just feels so good on the
skin I love it but the reason why I'm
mentioning this is because they did
collab with Nicole can see Leo to come
out with some different scents of primer
water and this one is my favorite if you
love coconut scent something that smells
really summery and spring you are going
to love the coconut 1/2 so easy Smashbox
photo-finish
so I can't say this so chill coconut
primer water have been using this loving
the scent but I would also even throw
this like in my lake bag or beach bag
and really refresh my skin throughout
the day if I feel like I need it you
smell of coconut in the spring and
summertime just makes me so happy if
you're a big fan of the primer water
definitely check out the other sins that
they came out with
in collab with Nicole Concilio they have
the cutest little designs on them and
they smell absolutely delicious so
congrats to Nicole and definitely pick
these up on the sale I'm kind of going
backwards again and talking about
skincare I just want to quickly mention
drunk elephant you guys already know I'm
obsessed with this brand I've talked
about them so much so you have the
glycolic night serum and then the C from
a day serum I love them use them every
every single day I am NOT without these
products they really help with my
texture my pores they keep my skin nice
and clear it is rare that I have
breakouts if I do it's probably this is
that time of the month but otherwise I
never have breakouts and I feel like
these have helped with my redness so
much so definitely give these a try with
a 15% off sale I've also been trying out
this drunk elephant sea tango
multivitamin eye cream it says it firms
and brightens and it has power 5 C &amp;amp; 8
peptide blend makes my under eye is
really nice and smooth they're never dry
or anything like that I've just been
really enjoying this I'm a big eye cream
person I cannot be without eye cream I
need it in my life if I don't put it on
I noticed the biggest difference and I
do feel like this does kind of freshen
up that area and brighten it especially
in the morning I do use this day and
night but I do love it in the mornings
to kind of like refresh my eyes it's
kind of cooling and it just feels really
good on the skin and just completely
moisturizes that entire area I like to
put this product underneath my eyes and
I also put it on my eyelids because I
like to keep my eyelids moisturize as
well so yeah love this definitely check
it out
moving on to dry shampoo I actually
recently just tried out this dry shampoo
I thought I used to not like it but now
I love it it seems more powdery than it
used to be I don't know a dry shampoo
girl that I am is I don't care if it has
a white cast which is why I love the
batiste dry shampoo it gives me a white
cast but what I feel like it does is
it's so powdery kind of like baby powder
then it just really soaks up that oil
and I can go days without washing my
hair so I want to try this one out this
is the dry bar detox dry shampoo
shampooing sec it's just desorbs oil and
leaves hair feeling fresh and clean
between washes I really like this I
think this is a great dry shampoo to use
like on your first second even third day
hair I actually have it in my third day
here now and it looks really nice and
refreshed once I get to like
fourth day and I need to keep going I go
to my batiste because it's very very
powdery but this one does have more of
like that powdery finish it has a really
great scent to it and it does soak up
all that oil and just leave your hair
nice and fresh and look in clean you
know what I mean so clean you know what
I mean
highly recommend trying it out speaking
of Drybar
I have to say if you want a new curling
wand get that 15% off this one this is
so good I can't remember the exact name
of it I will have it linked down below
as well as all this other stuff but it
does have more of like a tapered wand it
goes from a little bit of a smaller
barrel up to a thicker barrel this is
how I get all my curls every curl you've
been seeing for the past like couple
months I think I've had this for a while
have been from this curling wand I love
it so much I've shown it in a video
before like me styling my hair with it I
keep mine at 430 degrees and then I just
curl my hair and they stay in four days
and they look so good best curling
whatever I love this so much okay what
should I talk about next I'll talk about
primers I want to talk about two
different ones this one you're probably
like what you don't know if you like
that I know but I keep using it I think
I really like it I think I've come to
the conclusion that you know what it's a
bomb primer because I have been really
enjoying it it is a touch of silk canvas
filter finish protective primer I've
used so much of this stuff as you guys
can see I just feel like it really
creates a nice smooth base for my
foundation now I don't know if this will
be something that I will go to in the
summertime as you guys know I'm very
oily this isn't necessarily a mattifying
primer but it does create this nice
flawless finish to the skin especially
with your foundation I have gotten so
many compliments on my foundation when I
wear my favorite foundation with this
primer I just feel like it's a really
great combo with a lot of my favorites
and it just really smooths out the skin
so if you want to try it out now's the
time you go get that coupon code if you
don't like it you can return it and then
another one that you guys know I'm
obsessed with is the Bobbi Brown vitamin
enriched face space this just feels so
good on the skin I would even use this
at nighttime if you just need a little
extra moisture or even throughout the
day you could toss this in your purse
even though it's kind of big but you can
still toss it in your purse if you just
want a little bit of some
on your skin even in your beach or lake
bag whatever I'm more of a lake person
so that's why I always say like a lake
bag I love it it does have shea butter
vitamin C and E and it just really
hydrates the skin plumps it up and
really makes you feel nice and refreshed
so love this you can use as a primer you
can use it on its own it's such a great
product okay so now I'm gonna tell you
guys about three different foundations
that I love and that you should
definitely check out I have so many
favorite high-end foundations but I
figured I would mention these because I
haven't mentioned them in a while and I
don't want you to forget about them
first one is the hourglass advantage to
take a foundation oh my gosh
this is such a gorgeous full coverage
foundation I this is like the only stick
foundation that I am through-and-through
100% obsessed with it gives such great
coverage it looks beautiful on the skin
I love applying it because it's just so
easy
blend it out with a brush or sponge and
it works perfectly have two shades I
have nude and then I believe warm beige
is my really nice self tan shade I love
it for traveling it's so easy convenient
in this little small package and I just
love the coverage now in the summertime
if you're oily you probably are not
gonna like this because it doesn't keep
you matte or anything like that but it
does look really beautiful on the skin
so it's one of those things where you
could wear it for like a special event
but if you want to wear it for like 12
hours and the heat and you oily you
probably don't want to wear this all day
but for a special event it'd be perfect
or even in the wintertime this would be
great as well because you won't be
sweating as much another one that you
guys should definitely check out is the
YSL all hours foundation this is such a
beautiful foundation it literally makes
you look poreless it is so beautiful it
lasts for a long time it is matte it
just looks really really good it's like
a nice comfortable foundation that just
looks completely flawless it's just
amazing I have quite a few colors of
this just depending on how self tan I am
it does have a pump it is a luxurious
foundation one thing I will say is don't
travel with this it's not very travel
friendly it does have this glass bottle
I have already shattered one of these in
one of my really nice makeup bags and I
was pretty upset about it first off I
lost a really great foundation second
off my nice makeup bag was ruined which
the makeup bag can be cleaned but you
know I just it's not travel friendly
wouldn't recommend traveling with it but
it is a really great foundation
otherwise another one that I want
with you is the new NARS natural radiant
long wear foundation this isn't super
new but I love this foundation so much I
wore this to my Meetup and had so many
of you asking what I was wearing was
this it was my Pilate I meet up last
weekend it was so fun so thank you so
much to everyone who came out you guys
were amazing I used to shave Barcelona
when I'm nice and self tan so this is
the shade Barcelona does have a pump to
it when I first saw this foundation I
was like okay says radiant is probably
gonna be super dewy I'm not about that
life I just don't know but this came on
a time where a lot of the high-end
foundations were saying like a payer
it's dewy it's gonna look great on the
skin its luminous then you put it on
it's kind of like more of a matte satin
finish and you're like I can do this
this is fine this definitely has more of
a satin finish it's not very dewy at all
and it stays on the skin for such a long
time it looks absolutely flawless on the
skin I know I'm telling you the same
thing about every foundation but they
just look really great I don't use
foundations if they don't make me look
good it just doesn't work I can't do it
so you could kind of base it on
depending on your price point even
though they're all high-end I believe
both of these are lower than the YSL one
so you could go for something like this
you know they're just really great
foundations and I highly recommend you
guys checking them out because I don't
play when it comes to foundations it's
got to be good to be a favorite you know
so I'm not gonna mention concealers
because we all know my favorite
concealer that is high-end is each
heart-shaped tape and nothing can top it
but if you want it I've talked about it
so many times so I tried to keep out
things that I've talked about over and
over again on this video but if you want
to that's a great concealer how they
recommend checking it out for powder I
definitely recommend the Too Faced peach
perfect powder I actually will probably
purchase another one because I have used
so much of this powder it is just one of
my all-time favorites it makes me look
poreless and so good it smells like
peaches tastes like peach it just sets
you makeup makes you look nice and matte
you don't look dry ever with this
product and I love it I apply it with my
Real Techniques sponge let's talk about
blushes for blush I really recommend the
honest Asya blushes so we have this
blush kit in radiant which is really
really pretty they are all matte shades
yeah all matte shades other than this
one right here which is okay because I
wouldn't really use this one the most I
use
these more than anything super pigmented
they're gonna last you a long time and
the packaging is so cute as well you
have a little mirror in there and it's
just awesome so again this is the
radiant blush kit and then the other
blush kit from them this is actually a
blush trio called peachy love if you
love if you love peachy blushes peachy
love is the way to go okay this is
beautiful
I usually just mix them all together and
put them on my cheeks and it gives you
just this gorgeous if I see peach again
it's very travel friendly it's a nice
slim compact and it's just perfect
another blush you should definitely
check out is the benefit Dallas blush I
feel like every time I look at this
blush I'm like okay it looks kind of
basic but it's so pretty when you put it
on your cheeks just really gives you a
gorgeous bronze cheek and it looks just
so pretty I love it so much I feel like
I didn't use it for the longest time cuz
it looked it's just boring but then when
you put it on it's just like really like
sexified your cheeks is that stupid when
you put this on it really does just give
you that gorgeous bronze look so if
you're going for like a bronze smokey
eye or something like that this is the
way to go because it just makes
everything look very sultry really
quickly I do want to talk about
eyeshadow palettes so 15% off you should
totally snag up some Natasha de Nona
eyeshadow palettes they are so expensive
but so worth it I will say they do
expire I have definitely had a few of
mine expire this green Brown palette is
pretty much done for but it's so pretty
and I've used it so much that I honestly
don't want to get rid of it even though
I know I should I really love this
palette but once they kind of start to
expire and go bad they don't blend as
well as they used to so if you buy a
Natasha Danone a palette girl use it all
the time get your money's worth out of
it and it's a great palette I do like
the tropic palette - I don't know if
that video is up now but I did do a look
with it and I was very surprised by it
because I wasn't loving the newer
formula that she has but that palette is
pretty nice I like it but I don't I
haven't used it enough to include it in
this video but I have used this green
Brown palette more than enough times and
then also the sunset palette I mean I I
just this is so good
this is such a beautiful palette perfect
for spring and summer even the fall time
I mean you can do some bu
looks with this and it's just one of my
favorite palettes as well and then the
last I showed a palette is the Tarte
clay play palette this is a must-have I
feel like in any collection because it's
all matte shades you also have matte
contours smells like chocolate it's just
such a great palette you have a black in
here you have some cool tone Browns warm
tones you have some nice highlight
shades it's just an all matte palette
which I feel like is essential using a
palette that has mainly all shimmers and
you need a transition shade this is
where you can go to if you need a black
go to this palette you know what I'm
saying like it has everything you need
think it's a staple I love it just a
couple more things on I mentioned to you
guys the YSL babydoll mascara I am back
on this okay just because I bought it
and I was like I wonder if I still love
it like I used to because I used to love
this mascara and it is such a good
mascara it gives you so much volume it
separates your lashes it just looks so
beautiful it's a staple and if you want
to try out a luxurious mascara this is
the way you can I love the brush it is a
rubberized brush but it gives tons and
tons of volume as well as hooda beauty's
liquid matte lipsticks the one that I
have used the most is bombshell
bombshell is so incredibly beautiful
it's like one of those staple colors so
it's definitely a pink nude it is just
gorgeous and then I also love this one
called girlfriend this line is so pretty
oh these these colors are everything
okay guys says it for my support vib
sale recommendations I personally will
not to be participating in these sell
this year just because I pretty much
have everything I want and there's
nothing at Sephora that I feel like I
absolutely need you know maybe I'll get
some restocks like my laksa top and body
butter some more jo Malone diffusers and
my body wash I might get some of things
like that but I feel like it's not
interesting enough for a haul video but
for makeup I'm probably not gonna get
anything just because I have pretty much
everything that I need so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video let me know
where you're gonna pick up down below in
the comments thank you guys so much for
watching I hope you enjoyed this and I
will see you all in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
