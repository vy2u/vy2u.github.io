be doing my VIP recommendations video
now Sephora has this cell every year
twice a year the first time around it's
15 and then this time around towards the
holidays it is 20% off which is like the
best because the four never has sales
unless the product is like crap I mean
let's be honest I'm really excited to
share these products of you I have some
holiday stuff I have some oldies but
goodies some staples and I'm also gonna
share with you guys what is in my basket
on Sephora calm as I wait for the vib
sale now I am vib Rouge but I missed
that sale because I didn't get my
together and like get my list up but now
I have a list it's about like 10 or 11
items nothing too crazy but I figured I
would share with you at the end of this
video if you were curious you want to
see all of my vib cell recommendations
then alicia's go ahead and get started
so I'm gonna try to get through these
pretty quickly because if I talk in
depth about everything we're gonna be
here for a very very long time so first
thing I would recommend is the Smashbox
primer water I think you guys know this
by now this is one of my favorite
primers ever it's really great for oily
skin as well if you feel like you need a
refresher need some hydration this is
the best way to go I use this every
single time I wear any sort of face
makeup even though this product doesn't
like fill in my pores or anything or
help with texture it does hydrate my
skin which helps foundation lay a lot
better than if it was like really dry so
I love this and then I put a pore
minimizer in the areas that I need it
which is in my t-zone but I highly
recommend this get it sweeps enough cuz
it's the bomb okay next up is the YSL
let me fix this top make it pretty for
you
next up is the YSL all hours foundation
I think this is so pretty I know this
has a very high alcohol content so just
look into it see if you want to purchase
it and whatnot I actually took this
traveling with me which I wouldn't
recommend you can see the bottom is
messed up because this is a really nice
glass bottle and I took it traveling
because that's just who I am
I like this foundation a lot it does
have a pump and it just looks really
really good on the skin it doesn't
accentuate pores and makes your skin
look flawless you can have texture and
it still looks good I just oh I love
this foundation Ally it's one of my
favorites again I don't
every single time I put on my makeup but
I do really love it for like special
occasions because it makes me look
flawless okay next up is the hourglass
vanish stick foundation this is one that
I would recommend if you have more dry
skin not super super oily I mean I have
really oily skin and I wear it but you
are gonna get pretty shiny really
quickly but the coverage of this is
amazing I think it's one of the best
actually the best stick foundation I've
ever tried because it doesn't ever look
cakey it doesn't break up on the skin
and it really covers absolutely
everything and looks flawless if you're
oily and okay with getting shiny a
little bit quickly and having to blot
more I would totally go for this I think
it is so pretty great on the skin and I
love the shade warm beige for when I'm
nice and soft and it's my favorite this
last for such a long time and looks
gorgeous in photos next up is this tarte
holiday blush palette i think this is
holiday I can't keep up any more of you
this is what it looks like you do have
eight blushes and two highlighters as
you can see I have been using this I
love this palette first off because I
love the Tarte Amazonian clay blushes I
think they're phenomenal so having this
is just so great because it's compact
easy to travel with this is honestly
gonna last you so long instead of just
buying one Tarte blush just go buy this
and you'll be set for quite a long time
I just think it's great the quality is
still there they're not different from
the original Amazonian clay blushes and
this highlight right here and whimsical
is really nice wouldn't say I love it
more than the spotlight pot but it is
nice because I was traveling forgot my
highlight so I use that one and it
looked really great in photos next up I
have this Tarte brush set and I'm
showing you this one because it kept
another one that I believe the one that
I kept is on the website I'm not sure
but I know they do have something very
similar to this on their website and I
would highly recommend picking it up
because Tarte brushes are amazing and
they don't skimp on them in these kind
of like gift sets you've been wanting to
try Tarte brushes I would recommend this
because these are my favorite brushes
when they come out with stuff like this
that's when I usually gravitate towards
them because they're more fluffy and
there's a lot more options and usually
they just have like one or two brushes
that kind of go with different
foundations this is just a really great
set if you want to try it out and you
get a little colder I mean this is good
so with these sale
I think it's really smart to go in if
there's something that is like really
above your price range that you've been
wanting this is the time to get it when
I think of things above my price range
I think of Natasha de Nonna and this is
the perfect time to purchase her
palettes there are over a hundred
dollars so her pallets are it's insane
but they're really great quality so I do
have the sunset palette here this is a
really great warm toned palette is
beautiful the quality is there I love
the shades
I love the mattes I love the shimmers I
love the intense litters I mean it's
just it's there these are such good eye
shadows I really recommend picking up
her palettes at this time so again the
sunset palette as well as this green
Brown palette which I did use for my
wedding ceremony and I loved it it's
pretty beat up but I think it's great I
love this palette so much and I use it a
lot as well as her blackest black
eyeshadow which is just a single
eyeshadow that is such a great black
because it blends so well she does have
a few different palettes now that you
could choose from she has a purple one a
more blue toned one but these two are by
far my favorite from her and I purchased
them myself and I love them and then if
you don't want to go the route of
Natasha de Nonna
then the Sephora Pro warm palette is
amazing as well very very pigmented you
have a lot of shades to choose from it's
really similar to the sunset palette but
just a little bit different but this
does have some really pretty shades in
here you have a lot of mattes a lot of
shimmers and the quality is there as
well so if you want to save some cash
this is a great way to go I also have
two different ones an electric palette
which is intense and then they have a
cool tone one which isn't my favorite
and one last one that's a little bit
more compact but still in the warm tones
side because I'm a warm toned freak I
can't stay away from it is the Too Faced
Just Peachy palette this is an all matte
palette so there are no shimmers in here
so it's gonna be up to you kind of like
what you're feeling but this is a really
great palette you have a lot of pretty
shades again just very warm and perfect
for I think year-round
up to you but I think you around this is
perfect this does smell like peaches if
you're wondering and I really really
like this a lot so this is what it looks
like and then last but not least are
these liquid lipsticks from Smashbox I
believe they came out with the metallic
ones on Sephora I'm not sure I thought
they were
with them like next year but these are
so good
any of their liquid lipsticks are just
they're so good they've came out with so
many different colors which I love here
too my favorites True Grit
is one of my favorite like deep Browns I
mean you can't you can't get prettier
than that that is so pretty they're very
opaque and I love the applicator of the
I mean they just have the best formula
it's not drying it doesn't crack on your
lips it just looks really really good
and they last for such a long time and
then this is a new favorite it is
gorgeous
this is in the shade out loud this is
more of like a warm tone oh my god this
is like a warm orange oh my god that is
just that look at that okay now let's
talk about what I have in my cart on
Sephora so I have some repurchases in
here have some things from like old days
that I kind of want to try out again and
then I have some new products that are
I'm itching to try but let me know if
you like them because I'm a little
there's one thing I'm a little nervous
to buy because I've seen such mixed
reviews and it's so expensive but
anyways I'll just tell you what it got
also and I'm talking through these
products I'll have a image pop-up of
what they are so you can see them first
thing is the Natasha de Nona eyeshadow
palette 5 this is no surprise because
these came out and I was like oh my gosh
I have to have that number 5 one there's
just something about this eyeshadow
palette that I just I love though super
excited I'm going to be getting this
hopefully at the vib sale another thing
that I repurchase that I actually have
right here is the lock seat on ultra
rich body cream now they did change up
their packaging I don't know if you guys
have noticed they went to a 10 top which
is pretty nice I think it looks a little
bit more fancy but I guess I am
repurchasing this because I love it and
I don't think my body is prepared for
winter here at drum so I want to make
sure I have the perfect moisturizer for
my skin this is like the best
it keeps me super moisturize no matter
how dry I am this saves the day I'm
going to purchase this because it is
super expensive and I'm gonna get two of
them because I need to make sure I'm
fully stopped so I'm going to be
repurchasing these sol de janeiro
foreplay moisturizing shower cream gel
because I love it it's very moisturizing
as well and it smells really good and I
just haven't had it and so long when I
used it I was loving it and then I'm not
gonna lie I saw James this video on talk
to you Shannon I thought it was so cute
and I was trying to get ideas for Davis
as well and he had mentioned this and I
was like oh my god I forgot all about
that body wash I love that body wash so
I threw it in my car and I was like I'm
gonna go buy that another recommendation
from I know Davis isn't gonna watch this
video another recommendation from James
is the Kiehl's clothes shavers shave
cream the shirt he said was like the
best of the best and I trust him so I
figured I would get it for Davis as
stocking stuffer so I have that in my
card oh I have this Sephora collection
winter flush blush palette first off
it's only $16 honest Asya has a blush
palette out as well I don't know how
much it is but I'd know what I need $16
I know it's a little bit higher price
than that I just want to try it out and
kind of compare the two as well to see
if you could save some cash and just get
this a for collection one and not the
anasazi one but I did purchase the
anasazi one in my Ulta order that is
coming this week so I'm having a huge
order from Ulta come in this week so if
you want to see a haul let me know down
below and I will work on that for you
but there's a lot of drugstore and some
stuff from honest Asya that I want to
order right away so those are coming in
the mail now okay so this next one is
the one I'm nervous about because it's a
hundred and twenty-five dollars I'm sure
you know what I'm talking about
but it's the Pat McGrath mothership to
eyeshadow palette it just looks so
pretty from the pictures like it just
looks so so so nice but I've seen some
very mixed reviews on the actual shadows
there's only ten I shadow Zin here so I
it's in my cart but I can't confirm if
I'm gonna buy it just yet let me know
down below if you guys have tried it or
not I can't decide it just yeah I mean I
know I can return it but I'm just I'm
not there yet another thing is the color
pop golden state of mine shadow palette
now I haven't tried I don't think any
color pop eyeshadows I don't think at
all I don't think I've ever tried their
eyeshadows I've only tried things that I
used to get in like little bags like the
little empty bags or something which was
like freaking so long ago I'm really
interested
to try this out because it looks
absolutely stunning stunning on the
website and I don't know I'm just all
about it I know it's all shimmer palette
but I'm here for it I have matte shadows
so I don't mind having to pull a matte
shadow for that palette it's $26 I think
it's really cool that color pops in
Sephora and I just want to try them out
I got that as well as a repurchase of
the makeup forever ink liner which is
this one right here just a very very
nice matte eyeliner super super black
and I've just memory purchasing this for
so long that I figured I might as well
get another one when I could get 20% off
so we have three more things I have the
hood of beauty obsessions I shut up
highlight now I have this in my cart
when I just saw a video today somebody
like holding it in their hand and it is
so small I don't know I really want to
try it out I love who - Beauty stuff
right now and I don't know the smoky
palette is just kind of calling my name
and then another thing I have in my car
is the NARS sheer glow foundation and I
wanted to try this because I remember I
was even thinking about throwing the
makeup forever map of the plus in my
basket because I was just thinking about
back in the day how I used to use the
NARS sheer matte and people are like oh
my god you need to try sheer glow even
if you have oily skin you just need to
try it so every time I go on the site
and look at it I think about that moment
of you know years ago when people talked
about it and I just don't ever go and
buy it I'm interested to see how it will
wear on my skin and then again I've been
thinking about purchasing the makeup
forever matte velvet plus because if you
watched me way back in the day then you
understand that I used to love the shade
45 I'm just interested to see if I still
loved it yeah that is all my
recommendations and what is currently in
my cart let me know what you guys are
gonna purchase from the sale I want to
know down below also if you're gonna get
that Pat McGrath mothership thing or if
you already have it please let me know
your thoughts down below because that
will help determine if I want to buy it
or not because this is a lot of money
for a pallet I mean etosha to Nonna I
splurge on her palettes like this
because I know the quality I would be
very surprised if I got a pallet that I
didn't like but Pat McGrath I have not
tried any of her eye shadow product so
let me know down below in the comments
thank you guys so much for watching I
hope you enjoyed this video and
I'll see you guys in my next one Yama
music by you tear me to pieces so where
does it come from seem that keeps plain
