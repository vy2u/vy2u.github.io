show you 10 items from Sephora that I
recommend for the VIP Rouge and vib sale
that is coming up in like a couple days
or maybe tomorrow maybe today I forgot
when it goes live it's sometime early in
the month of November for vib Rouge and
then a little bit later for VIP members
you can even just use this as
inspiration to figure out what to buy at
Sephora because these are new products
that I have purchased recently that I've
been using and you might have seen a
couple of the products but for the most
part everything is pretty new so yeah
I'm excited to share with you these
products I really really love them and I
highly recommend all of them by the way
I hope you don't find my hair I had it
down but then it was like getting in my
face and it was annoying me so I was
like pulling it back and now I feel like
I'm five years old all over again it's
great it's great
reminiscing if you guys like this video
don't forget to give it a thumbs up as
well I would love your support so just
go ahead and click that thumbs up button
if you liked it and yeah let's just go
ahead and get started with this video
okay so the first thing is related to
lips I purchased this in my Sephora haul
which if you guys haven't seen it it was
my last video up so I will leave it down
below in the description box if you want
to check it out but I did get these glam
glow and lip treatments they came in a
set together so you get the glam glow
fuzzy lip exfoliating treatment which is
this one and then you also get the wet
lip balm treatment they both stay on
here what they are so you don't have to
like open it up and look even though
you're gonna have to open up a nice but
anyways so this is the exfoliator all
you do is just take a tiny bit and rub
it on your lips for about 5 to 10
seconds then add a little bit of water
to your finger again rub it and then
rinse it all off and then all you do is
you just take the lip balm and you put
this on top and I really like this stuff
I've been using it ever since I got it
and I just use it before I did my makeup
today the exfoliating and the lip
treatment and they just leave my lips so
soft and great for matte lips I just
love it if you have an issue with dry
lips are getting chapped here in the
inner part I would definitely recommend
something like this and you could also
use the lip exfoliator about 2 to 3
times a week but you can use the lip
every day if you wanted to so the next
thing I would recommend to you guys is
this brush I've been using this for
foundation and I am in love with it this
is the beautiful finish brush by bare
minerals and I love it it does kind of
have that indention here and at first I
was scared about that I was like oh gosh
it's just not gonna work out but this
blends foundation so beautifully I've
used it with my Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation which you guys know I love
and I've used it with another foundation
that I'm loving right now that I'm about
to show you guys but this is a great
brush it gives a little bit but it's
still nice and dense it's more dense
here in the center and then the bristles
are lightly packed around here and I
don't know what it is just blending and
circular motions this just blends
everything into the skin beautifully ok
the last thing for brushes is inked art
set I haven't used this little guy but I
have used this one for a concealer but I
recommend the brush set so much from
Tarte it comes in a cute little sequin
case which I will actually show you I
should have been prepared it comes in
this cute little case which i think is
amazing it's a nice nice pencil case you
can use this for traveling and your
makeup is not gonna get messed up or
squashed but it comes to this little
case and you get a bunch of different
brushes you get five of them I've been
using another one so it's like over here
somewhere
but these brushes are amazing and you
can use them for so many different
things and I think they're essential and
I think the price that you get for them
is awesome so definitely pick these up
from Sephora okay something that is new
that I have not shown you guys hit that
I'm obsessed with I'm wearing it right
now it is B cover X it is the cover FX
custom cover drops I love this makes
some wd-40 for my chair if anybody wants
to help a sister out so I am in the
shade in 40 right now I haven't really
felt and so this is my shade right now I
love this honestly I did not have high
expectations for this I thought I was
gonna be super light coverage and I was
expecting to actually mix it with
another full coverage foundation to like
lighten it up and I was like oh let's
just see how this works cuz I had
himself tanned or anything I put it on
my face and I accidentally put too much
because I thought it was gonna be like a
BB cream kind
leverage and I was using this
bareMinerals brush and I put it on and I
was like oh my gosh like when it would
cover up my redness there were certain
spots that weren't covered it looked
like my redness was so intense because
the rest of it was so full coverage and
I mean I was like from this I'm still
happy with it it does have a matte
finish on me I didn't set it with a
powder I did set my under eyes with
powder but not my whole face with a
powder but yeah I'm impressed with this
stuff
definitely check it out if you have oily
skin I think it's great next thing this
is a new collection out by NARS this is
ignores Steven Klein this one's the
despair cheek palette I don't know if
they have decimal support but they do
know that they have a bigger version on
Sephora that I actually purchased
because I was like oh yeah
I never heard of any of these shades
before so this is the one I have and I
love it you have three different blushes
I'm actually wearing this one right now
I can't tell just a really pretty peachy
glow and it comes with a NARS either
brush but the one that I want from
Sephora has bronzer in it to like a
couple different bronzers and it is so
beautiful I will leave a link for down
below because you need it in your life
like this is so pigmented I had to blend
out this blush like crazy because I was
like oh it's not gonna be that bad it
was super pigmented and I was like oh
crap in there with my duo fiber brush
just like blending away sometimes NARS
comes out with palettes that are like
repeating themselves and it's just like
you use the same colors every time like
I don't need orgasm in every single
palette you know what I mean so for them
to switch it up is awesome and I highly
recommend the blush palettes from this
collection they're awesome
now I know I mentioned this in my
favorites video but I really love it and
if you're just wanting to splurge on
something since you're getting a
percentage off this is something to try
it's such a great powder I use this like
I said in my last video to set my makeup
and it just looks so oh hello listen is
that it is just so beautiful on the skin
it is so fine it just sinks and like
butter and it makes you look poreless I
love it now I don't know like I said in
the other video how it is for a powder
foundation I'm not a big
powder foundation person I just don't
like it I've got redness on my skin that
I need to cover up and powder
foundations just don't do it for me
but this as a setting powder is
phenomenal and I know it's pricey but I
promise you I would never recommend
something like this if it wasn't worth
the money I would recommend anything if
it wasn't worth the money okay the next
thing is also what I mentioned in my
Sephora ha I'm wearing this right now it
is the sea octane ciat liquid velvet in
swoon and I love this actually have a
NYX lip product underneath this so it
looks a little bit darker but I love
this lip color so much just a gorgeous
peachy nude and I love it it's beautiful
I want so much already
another great thing about it is it does
last all day but it's not like super
drying on the lips it's a matte lip
color but it's not gonna like sink into
your fine lines and make everything look
a little bit worse so I love this it's
awesome I would definitely check out
this line and the different colors that
they have okay so have three more things
to show you guys the first one is a
blush this is the urban decay afterglow
8 hour blush and video the reason why I
chose this is because I love this for
any look I mean any look it's just a
gorgeous neutral peachy bronzy pink
blush and I love it you can build it up
and it just looks so gorgeous with
anything and it's really smooth and it
blends out very very easily so Urban
Decay's video the bomb I just had this
sneak this one in here because I love it
and I've heard a lot of people with dry
skin love it and all these skin love it
so I just wanted to like pop on here and
say try this out so Smashbox photo
finish primer water I know they have
smaller ones at the checkout line you
know where they always get you with
those little items but this is so good I
love it I was never a believer of
setting sprays skin and Naevia sings
phrase I just dead in like him they
didn't work for me I would like have
such high hopes for them and they just
didn't work out but this is my second
bottle of this stuff and I just love it
I cannot do my makeup without it it
makes me feel so refreshed and really
gets my skin ready for foundation and
everything that I'm gonna put on so
Smashbox a photo finish primer water is
a must and if
recommend checking it out cuz I love it
now this is the last thing I chose a
pallet for my last thing to mention and
this is like my favorite palette and the
reason why I'm mentioning it to you is
because I recommend this for any time of
the year and it has so many different
things in this palette that you can do
if you do a full face with this palette
and it's awesome so it is these Smashbox
shapematters palette you get a big
mirror which is great for traveling and
then you get three six nine eyeshadows
which I'm wearing all of these on my
eyes today well not all of them that's
what I'm wearing on my eyes today and
you get a bronzer a contour shade you
get a highlight shade and then the glow
shade this is sorry I can't figure out
this is a matte highlight shade like a
banana powder so I use this underneath
my eyes which is what I use today then
they use this highlight today and look
at that I know you guys see that
highlight it is so beautiful this is
such a beautiful highlight sometimes
highlighters and palettes are like
really cheap and really like not worth
it
but this is awesome okay so then here
you have a wax a taupe shade and then
they stopped brown shade for your brows
which is awesome so I love this palette
you can do anything with this you have
so many just so this mirrors go-stop so
yeah this is the palette absolutely love
it you can do your full face with it and
I just think it's awesome and the
eyeshadows are just so beautiful it's
like I said since I have on my eyes it's
like bronzer eye contour all right thing
but my brows cuz my brows are Anasazi a
dip brow just because I've been using it
forever and I love it you can use these
shades for many different things like
you I like to use this one as a
transition shade because it's a little
more warm than this one right here I
also can use these as eyeshadow shades
as well and I love the fact that they
have a little cover covering the wax so
you don't get color in there that's just
so smart it's the little things in life
like a cover for your brow wax means a
lot yeah I really love that palette I
think you guys should totally check it
out and yeah that's pretty much it for
