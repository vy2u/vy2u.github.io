a haul with Mac and Sephora I purchased
a few things over the past couple weeks
couple days all that so we thought I
would show you guys cuz they haven't
done a haul in a while especially one
with some high-end products so yes I'm
just gonna go ahead and get started with
Mac now the reason why I went back to
math was to are you surprised to get a
new shade for my mac prolongwear
foundation now I did do a first
impression on it in the end there we
have 35 did match pretty well but the
color was just off a lot of you saw it I
saw it it was just kind of false so I
went back and I matched now to an NC 30
and right now I'm currently wearing NC
35 because I asked her first because I
asked her for a sample of it and that's
what I'm wearing now it's a little bit
lighter than my body but you know it's
okay so I got NC 30 because I was kind
of faded yesterday my self tanner was at
least but with a little bronzer it'll be
fine
so I'm so far liking this better the NC
35 at least looks a lot better with my
skin tone I was like I'm just so over
looking like I'm red all the time you
know I was there I purchased a couple
other things and I did get the Mac blush
and Melba and it's a beautiful beautiful
color this is like a cult favorite on
here and it's just gorgeous I can't wait
to wear it it's gonna look great I think
I'm going to take it with me to
beautycon if you guys are not aware if
you don't follow me on Twitter I did say
that I am going to beautycon next
weekend me and Cole are flying out that
Friday we're gonna be there til Sunday
so I'm very excited I will be at the
Bellamy booth if you guys are wondering
I'll be there and they'll have like a
bunch of discount codes on their stuff
and they'll be showing you different
styling tools that they have which is
gonna be great and yeah I hope to meet
some of you there so if you're gonna be
at beautycon next weekend please let me
know in the comments below I would love
to meet as many of you as I can
because I'm
I met a subscriber before but yeah I'm
really excited about this it's a
gorgeous shade and it's matte so that's
always good as well I also got the mac
242 brush i love mac brushes I've had
really good experiences with my mac
brushes so I wanted to try an eye brush
from them because I think only have an
eyeliner brush from them and that's it
so I thought I would try this out
they're really expensive so I usually
pick up one each time I go and then the
next thing I got I was supposed to get
this in the loose powder but she picked
up the pressed powder and I was like
I'll just go ahead and try it
it's the Mac prep and prime transparent
finishing powder and it's not a color or
anything
obviously it's transparent so that's
what it looks like it's supposed to be
really great at setting your makeup i've
swatched it a couple times and it looks
like it really does blend into the skin
nicely but yeah I didn't want the loose
powder but hopefully the pressed powder
works just as well okay moving on to
Sephora so the first thing I want to
show you guys is this Urban Decay b6
vitamin infused complexion prep spray
whew that's a lot it's supposed to be
red this reduce ink or minimizing and
oil absorbing and I have used this once
and the only time I used it I did not
notice a difference in my redness you
guys don't have a lot of redness on my
cheeks I did notice a lot of difference
and it knows the difference with my
pores or the oil absorbing product part
of it as well I got this because it had
amazing reviews on Sephora but let me
just say a ton of people rave about the
Urban Decay D slick and they rave about
all those different kinds of sprays from
them I've tried these like I did not
like it I did think it helped with my
oil at all and this isn't really working
for me either so what is the problem in
mine is my skin just not having it with
these Urban Decay's sprays
I don't know but I figured I'd keep
trying it because it does have some
vitamins in it and you know if that's
you know great to go ahead and spray on
your face before your makeup so you are
some service sprays on your face before
you make up and then you can spritz it
on your face throughout the day if you
prefer but yeah I haven't noticed a huge
difference but maybe it's just my skin
maybe just doesn't like a sprays on them
and then the next thing which I didn't
have
good was it called I don't have a good
experience with is the benefit stay
Follis 15-hour primer this is a new one
that's a force sent me because my old
one if you follow me on instagram you
saw the picture and i'll show you guys
right here it did I used it once I put
the leg back on and I went to use it the
next time it wasn't like the next day
but I you went to use it like a couple
days later and pull the top off and it
just fell out
it wasn't stuck to the cap at all it
literally just like fell out and I was
like oh my god just split it in half if
I haven't even used it twice so I got it
because everybody was raving about it
and I was like ok you know I wanted to
see what all the hype is about all about
trying new primers and that did not put
a good taste in my mouth I know a lot of
people were saying you know just take it
and push it back in there and I'm like
no no no no no it's a 30 color primer it
shouldn't be splitted in half like that
but supported sent me another one I did
return the other one so I should be
getting my thirty dollars back I haven't
tried it again the first time I tried it
I really I made my George foundation
stayed on pretty well but honestly it
stays on pretty well anyways so I don't
know I'll try to get it soon since this
is basically a free one and I'll let you
guys know how I like it I don't like it
I don't have a good experience with it
then I'm gonna let you know because I'm
gonna let you know not to spend your
money on it that's all I don't care if a
company doesn't like me for it I don't
care if they don't study products so I'm
just letting you know I'm always honest
with you I will never tell you to
purchase something if I truly don't
think it's a great product and if I
don't like it I'll let you know we'll be
on to products that I do like did your
air flash matte touch this is so good
especially if you have very very very
oily skin if you have dry skin or if you
have combo skin with dry patches I would
stay away from this because it would
cling to your dry patches but if you
have very oily skin you will love this
if you are willing to purchase it like
because I know it is pricey trust me I
know but if you're willing to purchase
it it is so good I use it with my arrow
flash foundation it is like a god stick
oh it's beautiful and keeping that all
day I will probably be doing an updated
flawless foundation routine with this
because a lot of you been asking me how
I like it
I freaking love it and I'd be using
really good primers with it so if you
want to see that then let me know in the
comments below because I'm probably
going to do an updated foundation
routine with this and I still have a
good that left and I've been using this
all month so this is great what I like
to do is spray on the powder brush and
then just press it into my skin I don't
swirl it around or anything like that
and it looks really great also I did
spray this like on my face like so and I
had powder in my hair because it is
tinted so you're gonna see the powder
but it's it keeps you matte like I'm not
even kidding it's so good and then the
next thing is something that I just
couldn't resist this helped me get up to
the idea Rouge first off so ha but I did
get the YSL babydoll mascara I mentioned
this mascara in my favorites last month
I had a sample of it and I was like I
don't know if I should buy it and girl
you know I would have inque min and I
bought it so I loved it and wearing it
today I love it because it looks like
I'm wearing false lashes and I'm not I
always get compliments on my eyelashes
when I wear this mascara and I'm just I
couldn't help myself I was like oh I've
never ever ever ever ever purchased a
high-end mascara cuz I was like I'm not
gonna pay $30 for a mascara but this is
the only one that has proven to me that
it is worth the money so I highly
recommend it if you can snag a sample of
this I definitely recommend you trying
it it's that good moving on so I
purchased recently I want to get this
one out of the way it's the bumble and
bumble bees thickening dry spun finished
dry spray create dry spray creates
instant fullness and hold its Airy
texture that's a lot but I want to try
this I've never tried bumble and bumble
I kind of feel like this brand is a hit
and miss with a lot of people especially
if you look on the reviews on the
Sephora website I've been using a lot of
very sexy or big sexy hair products this
month because I've been wearing my hair
straight and I like it to be volume eyes
I'll let you guys know what I've been
using to keep my hair you know with some
volume and texture and the end of the
in my favorites video but I wanted to
try this because it just sounded
intriguing and I was like spray it and
it adds instant fullness and I was like
ooh I want to try that
I love full hair I love big full hair I
wish my hair was super thick but it's
not and then the next thing that's not
makeup related is this self tanner that
actually came to the US I think back in
May it's the Vita Liberata a two week or
two to three week tan I got it in dark
because of course I want to be dark I
did self tan with it last night so do I
look dark to you really dark I don't
know if I look dark I thought I was
gonna be streaky as hell this morning
but it was not I was thinking the Lord
cuz I was like I have to go to a lunch
this morning if I look streaky I'm not
gonna go to the lunch but yeah I really
like this so far I don't like the fact
that I have to apply it with my Center
payment because I haven't time I applied
with the mint I'm like trying to you
know rub it in and then I'm it keeps
going everywhere like all over my hand
and I'm like stay on my place
dang it so I never tried a mousse with
my hands though if you have let me know
how you like it down below
did it give you a lot of streaks or not
but I think I just need to purchase
another myth but so far the formulation
is really nice and it did give me a nice
brown color okay moving on to makeup
products I did get this so for
foundation is the perfection mist air
but airbrush foundation and I got this
because a lot of you wanted me to
compare this to the Dior air flash
mainly because it's more than leather or
it's less is more than less it's way
less than the price of this little guy
so I got the color medium I didn't know
if I should get medium or tan because
you know my color like fluctuates all
the time it might be too light I don't
know it's oil free and ya know I find it
really great supposedly this is their
upgrade from their last spray foundation
so hopefully it looks good next
foundation is I know I'm on a foundation
kick right now I don't know what the
problem is I have
enough in my drawer this is the
hourglass immaculate liquid powder
foundation mattifying oil-free and this
is free of a lot of stuff it's paraben
free oil free fragrance free
nanoparticle free the late pretty late
free no no synthetic dye free gluten
free vegan free and water resistant and
supposedly I've heard this is the for
oily skin curls and I really hope it
lives up to the claim now you know how
Sephora I don't know if you guys know
but I would support and they matched me
to my duo foundation with their color IQ
thing that they're doing now and it's a
perfect match so I did the color IQ
online with the color that I was in the
Dior Foundation and this matched me to
light beige so I'm hoping this is the
color for me and we'll see how it goes I
might do a first impression I always
hate buying foundations online I never
know the shade but hopefully that color
IQ stuff actually works and hopefully
it's the right shape also I did purchase
again the benefit Porefessional primer I
did used to have this back in the day
and then I gave it away to a friend
I regret that because I wanted to kind
of see now since I've been using
Clarisonic if it made my skin red again
because the Clarisonic is literally
slowly but surely has been changing my
skin my redness has started to go down
some you know my skin's get a little bit
smoother so I kind of regret giving that
away cuz I had a ghost in the mind buy
this one but I used it today and it did
not make my skin red so I think the
Clarisonic is working wonders for me
lately and I'm hoping it's just better
results to come and yeah this is
literally the best product for pores
like if you have larger pores I know I
do I get self-conscious about them but
the primary side I've had I tried a
bunch of them since I given this one
away
and none of them compared to this one I
have drugstore high end everything none
of them compare to this for pore
minimizing so it's really great this
benefit primer is actually very very
good okay
two more things I did purchase the Stila
eyeshadow and kitchen I have it on my
ice today along with coppering by Mac I
might do a tutorial on this look let me
know if you want to see it but it's this
gorgeous gorgeous shadow it is literally
the softest most pigmented shadow I've
ever seen I didn't know how I'd like it
because I'm not really huge on liner eye
shadows I love dark shadows I love
putting them all over the lid I just
don't I love dark shadows but this one
is beautiful I see why everybody raised
about it especially with coppering oh it
looks so good so I'm really excited I
got this and this is also a pretty good
size it's - what is it two point six
grams yeah two point six grand so that's
really good and the last thing I got is
probably something that I will be
returning or not returning about
exchanging at the CIFOR I'm gonna go to
Atlanta Monday this is a Bobby Brown
bronzer in medium - this is a lot darker
than I thought it was gonna be how
pretty is for packaging oh my gosh
love love love for packaging but this is
a very dark bronzer it doesn't look dark
on camera but let me tell you this is
the darkest bronzer I've come across it
is so dark and has a red undertone to it
and then this so dark um I found a
bronzer I really loved when I was at the
Sephora store I couldn't find the color
online I was like okay I saw it in
stores and I loved it but I can't find
it online it makes no sense so I'm gonna
go back and get that shade and just
exchange this one because it looked a
lot lighter online but it is very very
dark really quickly I will show you my
point purse I have a lot of points that
I never ever ever used my points only
this time I use them so I got three
things I got the Illamasqua hydrating
veil or veal
rehydrating gels supposed to be a really
nice primer
I got it cousin said gel and it's
hydrating so hopefully I'll be okay for
my oily skin and yeah if it was like a
rehydrating lotion I would not have
but it's a gel so hopefully like stinks
into the skin really quick and then I
got the Kat Von D tattoo liner in
trooper I think this is black I don't
know but I got this little liner and
then the last thing I got is this
deborah lippmann polish and happy
birthday it's just a little glitter nail
polish and it's the perfect size for a
glitter nail polish I feel like because
let's be real none of us ever go through
glitter nail polish I mean some of us
might but why actually I never go
through a regular nail polish so I'm
okay with minis they're fine with me
this is called happy birthday it's a
really cute glitter polish and yeah that
is Nihal I hope you guys enjoyed this
