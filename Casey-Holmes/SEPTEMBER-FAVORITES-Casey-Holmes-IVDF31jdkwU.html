eat my hey guys so today is going to be
my September favorites and I'm so
excited to share this with you guys
because I have quite a bit of new stuff
to show you that I've been really loving
I have some fashion items body care and
of course I have makeup items as well so
excuse my voice I'm really sick right
now actually have a cup of green tea and
some honey right beside me because I'm
like sucking the stuff down so my first
favorite is actually something you guys
have seen or a lot of you've seen and
you tweeted to me and you've had nothing
but nice things to say so thank you so
much but is my partnership with Regal
Cinemas I am doing a series of them it's
called the makeup room where I do makeup
looks based on certain characters and
new movies that are coming out so
definitely check it out it was so much
fun we I was there for a whole week and
I really worked hard and try to do the
best that I could for you guys so I
really hope you enjoy it and get some
tips or tricks from it it was just so
fun like base the makeup looks off of
what you see in the movies and there's a
lot of crazy ones coming up so make sure
you go and subscribe to them and check
them out because it's really cool I'll
also have a playlist on my channel so
you guys can check that out that's the
first day right I just it was so much
fun and it's so crazy to see it's like
on their channel now it's just oh it's
so awesome another favorite is actually
this bracelet that soap &amp;amp; Glory gifted
to me I'll do a close-up on it but it's
a little dainty rose gold bracelet and
it has in Roman numerals the date that I
hit a million subscribers or just a lot
thank you guys so much for subscribing
and thank you sniffing Lord for this
because I'm such a sentimental person
and little things like this like
unexpected sentimental gifts are my
favorite and I cherish them so thank you
so much to them because I'm obsessed
with this bracelet okay so let's get
started with Bharti Kher and the first
thing we're gonna talk about is a new
body wash I've been using and I am so in
love with this stuff it's the OL a
two-in-one advance ribbons smoothing
cream and it
and what what is this in I don't even
know what flavors do then but it's just
a pink one that looks like this and I
love this stuff so much because it lasts
all day on my skin and it really does
moisturize my skin as well I'm so I'm so
in love with it it smells so good
oh it just it smells so good and I just
I reuse this last year completely forgot
all about it
repurchased it when I was in New York a
couple weekends ago and I'm like I'm
gonna grit through this whole thing at 6
it's expensive
I know I should have used that much but
I like to drench myself in this and I'm
telling you it lasts all day long now
this next topic it's kind of like a
topic I've never talked to you guys
about before because it's like a little
embarrassing but then again it's not
embarrassing it's just things that
happen in life but sometimes I get back
me and it's really annoying because a
lot of the times I'll get it when I'm
self-tanning no matter what self-tanner
I'm using it will always break out my
back it's just something it's nothing
like really dramatic and crazy but I
just get spots here and there where I
don't feel comfortable enough to go like
one day with a backless shirt on or
something like that but I have found
some products that really helped me and
I wanted to share them with you because
I got them on a whim but I am so in love
with them so the first thing that I do
is I use this murad acne body wash and
this is the cleanse tone part and it
says it exfoliates indeed cleanses to
control body breakouts and it helps to
heal soothe irritation so I use this
when I'm in the shower and I just put
this all over my back and it really
exfoliates nicely it doesn't burn or
anything but I really really do like
this a lot I think it's important to
exfoliate your back and just get all
that dead skin off but then once I got a
shower and I like dry off my back and
it's nice and dry and clean I will use
this Murad clarifying body spray and
this is the step two part which is the
treat and repair part I love this stuff
I think this stuff has made a really big
difference to this has a 360 degree
spray so you can spray it upside down
like this and then
not gonna like clog up or not spray out
I love that I'm glad they did that
because for me I don't have somebody
around the house all the time to like
spray my back or exfoliate my back when
I'm in the shower or something so having
the 360 spray is perfect because you can
just spray it like this go like that and
you get all the areas of your back and I
really do like this whenever it's drying
you do kind of feel it drying out your
back a little bit it's not like really
bad mint tint like I said that doesn't
overdrive but it does kind of draw out
your back but I have noticed such a huge
difference just using three these two
products I don't use the lotion I
believe the lotion was the next step I
don't use that um if I had like my
boyfriend all the time I would probably
have him put that on my back but I don't
so I just think it's hard to put lotion
on your back I don't know that's why I
barely ever self-tanning my back when
it's wintertime
I'm not self-tanning with that I haven't
done that part I've just done those two
steps and they've really worked wonders
for my skin so definitely check that out
if you're having that issue it's an
embarrassing thing if your back is
breaking out and you like you don't know
how to fix it I didn't know how to fix
it for the longest time and I just
decided to splurge on those and they've
helped a lot so hopefully it helped you
guys out if you're having an issue as
well okay and then for hair I got this
just to get it and I have been obsessed
with it it's the caviar anti-aging
working hairspray it says ultra dry
control and this is by alterna and I
really like this a lot
I just got a sample size because I was
in old tub before I went traveling I
just wouldn't pick this up and this
hairspray is amazing first up it is not
heavy and it does not feel like you have
hairspray in your hair and I spray so
much of the stuff in my hair because the
first time I use it I was like oh
whatever I'll just spray all over but
honestly first off it's not crunchy
second off you can run your fingers
through it and third my curls lasted all
day long and I was out and about and it
was missing and you know when it starts
misting and you have your hair all done
it's like okay you should have never
done it because your curls fall out my
curls did not fall out whatsoever with
this
product I've always loved all Turnham I
just tried different things from them
every now and then but this is
definitely something I'm gonna buy the
full size of because it's a miracle
worker for like weather conditions it
just worked so well for my hair so
that's what it looks like this brand is
a little pricey but I promise you it's
amazing I love this brand a lot I
actually use the shampoo right now the
caviar shampoo it's amazing and then
this is have two more things and then
we'll get onto makeup this is my
favorite perfume right now I also have
the other Dolce Dolce Gabanna one but
this one is the floral drops one and
it's in the frosted glass and I love
this it just smells so good oh it's just
a really nice floral perfume I honestly
didn't think I was gonna like it but I
like this better than the first one that
they came out with and it just smells
delicious I don't care if it's fall time
and I'm trying to smell like spring and
summer I don't care this smells so good
I love floral and this is just a great
addition to my collection so the Dolce
Dolce Gabanna floral drops in the
frosted glass is my favorite out of the
two and has been my favorite for a while
now and then the last thing I wanna show
you guys is a fashion favorite and I got
these boots from Free People a couple
months ago but I just never wore them
because it was summer and was still
super hot I mean you could wear these in
the summer but I just didn't have
anything to wear them with so they are
these boots right here they're a little
nasty because I went out in these but
they are so cute the little wrap wraps
around and it buckles it is a useful
wrap because you have to unbuckle it to
put your foot in at first I didn't like
that but I've grown to really love it I
had like this little flap right here and
I love the color of the boots I think
these are just so beautiful I love the
height and they're really really
comfortable I love free peoples shoes I
also I get this brand um I forget the
brand that I get it's called free bird I
believe I get free bird from free people
a lot too and I love that brand it's
always kind of like this rustic kind of
look very to me it looks kind of
stubborn you know I just I don't know I
really like it they're really cute and
I've been wearing
a lot this month so these boots are from
free people okay let's get started
with makeup the first thing I want to
talk about is this Tarte smooth operator
Amazonian clay pressed finishing powder
this stuff is so freakin good I am in
love with this stuff I found it in a
clutch because I was swapped it out
clutches and that's usually when I fine
old makeup products that I just haven't
used in a while because I put it in
there and then I hang the clutch back up
and like you never look in there ever
again but I found this and it's a white
translucent powder and I wish you guys
could see up close but this stuff it has
a huge debt in it but this is a really
fine powder and it just glides over your
skin and makes your skin look airbrushed
like I'm so in love with this is it a
new favorite product I cannot believe I
hadn't used it a long time it's just my
powder that I use to touch up and go if
I'm feeling oily or something and like I
said it's just so fine if you go into
Ulta or Sephora just feel it feel it
through your fingers and you'll feel
what I'm talking about it feels so good
on the skin next thing has been my
all-time favorite palette so far this
month I've also been loving the Smashbox
palette that I showed in my last fall
favorites or fall essentials video which
I'll link down below if you guys have
not seen that but this palette has just
been like the one that I wanted to tell
you guys to stop drop everything and
just go get it because it's beautiful
and I'm not surprised because I'm a huge
lorac fan so it's a lock Pro mega 2
palette their new one for fall and I'm
so in love with it oh my god
first off huge mirror amazing for
traveling sorry huge great for traveling
this is what I'm gonna be taking in the
next couple weekends because I just love
it you have two rows of matte shades and
two rows of shimmer shades and I'm just
I love the pro palette I love every
single Pro palette that they have come
out with not a big fan of the other
eyeshadows that they have but the pro
palettes I have all them and I love them
and this one is just well actually no I
don't have the first mega Pro palette
forgot that you might have other ones
and this is just so beautiful I've been
using it so much just what I have on my
eyes today I know I haven't done and
makeup tutorial in a while but I will be
doing a couple this week with this
palette so you guys can check it out I
know it came out this month so I'll try
to find a link I believe it's on Malta
yeah and I will leave it to down below
for you guys but I highly recommend it I
mean this is something you need in your
life so good okay next up is this Kat
Von D high-voltage eye primer this is a
prime and correct I love this because it
reminds me of the soft ochre Paint Pot
by Mac but a hundred times better I have
super oily eyelids so I'm very careful
of what I use because my eyeshadow will
crease in an instant I can't use like
the Urban Decay primer potion to things
like I can't use a regular primer I have
to use something that's ok with oily
eyelids because mine are super oily this
is great actually mix this with my NARS
primer if you had to get one thing for
your super oily eyelids
I recommend the ignores eyeshadow primer
I'll link it down below
it is a game-changer for anything
doesn't have a tint to it it is clear
but if you only want to purchase one
thing definitely get that but this one
is great because it has a yellow base to
it and it just corrects the eyelids so
you have an even canvas to apply how
your eyeshadow on and I love it it keeps
my eyeshadow on all day as well but I
just love the campus that it gives
because I've always wanted to purchase
soft ochre again and mix it with the
Norris primer I just love how had like
an even canvas it made it ready for
eyeshadow but this is so good like first
off it's easier because all you do is
you just squeeze it out of the tube you
only need a tiny amount than this stuff
will last you forever and I love it it
really holds onto the eyeshadow but you
can still blend everything out really
nicely this is something I got when I
was at CCO in New York and this is the
Bobbi Brown shimmer brick compact and
apricot I don't know if you can get this
right now I'm really sorry if it's not
online like a Nordstrom or Sephora but I
have been using it every single day and
I love it so this is what it looks like
right here it is just that apricot color
it's beautiful I love it I love it when
I self tan it just looks so gorgeous
I'll even take the lighter shades right
here and use them as eyeshadow
I mean I just I love her.she rubrics I
think they are beautiful so apricot has
been my new favorite from Bobby Brown I
was so happy I found this in the store
because I'm I think it's not online I'm
sorry if it's not but if you can find
this and get your hands on it like at
one of the CCOs
definitely get it and what I've been
using to apply my highlighter is this
lorac brush this came in the pro contour
kit I just really like this for
highlighter because it doesn't spread it
all over the place it just puts it right
on the top of your cheekbone and I'll
know if you guys can see but I do have
the that highlight on my face right now
but this just places it right there
above the cheekbone and it doesn't look
excessive I think sometimes when we take
a fan brush and put it all over
it's a beautiful highlight but it just
looks excessive when you're out and
about and stuff and people are like what
the hell is your face gleaming for Kirk
you know I'm saying this just places it
right there on the top of your cheekbone
and you just catch that light on the
highlight and it just glows it looks
beautiful so I like this brush more than
a fan brush right now just because it is
more precise and I just like the way it
looks better and then I've also been
loving this ball the ball meets
Matt Hughes long lasting liquid lipstick
that's a hell of a lot but this is in
the shape committed I love this color it
is so beautiful I mean it is just
stunning it's just a really gorgeous
warm pinky nude I just I don't know and
the way that it dries on my lips I'm
just obsessed with it and I think it is
beautiful I'll do it close-up on it but
I just love this color so much and it
lasts really well throughout the night
and I'm really surprised because I was
really excited to see the balm come out
with liquid lipsticks and they did a
really good job with the formula and all
the colors are super beautiful as well
so that was it for my video today I hope
oh my god no I have to do music
favorites oh my god literally funding
our new music favorites that would be
like what the hell is going all of you
I'm gonna get my music favorites
together but first maybe new drinks on
this team or you're crazy I'm just
drinking yogi green tea and then I put
this organic honey pure and raw 100% in
here cuz your girls having a really hard
lately my voice is just not going
anywhere well this is still hot hmm okay
so music favorites this month I think I
have quite a bit of favorites um my
music wise that I've just found recently
that I love cuz one day I find the song
I usually wear it out I'm sorry that's
probably going once I find a music
favorite that I love I usually just wear
it out like immediately in the next
month I'm like oh yeah I like that song
but I just you know I ruined it for
myself I always keep a lot of my
favorites on work out to work out on my
Spotify account if you don't know my
Spotify I'll leave it in here somewhere
okay the first one is called you don't
own me by grace and this is like my song
when I was single this is like my exact
thought process and it's still my like
thought process now like it being
independent doing your own thing and not
having anybody else like come up to you
and say you know you can't do this so
you can't do that you know I'm saying
for my girls out there that are
independent and have their ish together
or even if you're working on getting
your is together you know what I'm
saying I love this song and I feel like
you guys would love it too it's so
dramatic but it's just so true
Oh
it's so good okay obviously I've been
loving right hand by dre cuz if you
don't love right hand I'm obsessed with
it and I saw the thigh another girl
dancing and doing her makeup of steps
with her I would be friends of her and
heartbeat that's where I first heard it
and I looked it up and I'm like Cassie
why you think it's a girl
it's a great song so right hand by Drake
is also been loving lady killers by gez
featuring Hoodie Allen I really love
Hoodie Allen I just let this song I
don't really know the words but I love
