nine let's try this again shall we hey
guys so today's video is going to be my
September favorites and so excited
October you've no idea I love all time
I'm so excited
I want to go on hayrides I want to go to
haunted houses just let me soak it in
for a minute okay
I'm gay I don't have a lot of makeup
favorites for the month but I do have
some different favourites to show you
guys and I think you are really going it
too like and yeah so the first thing I
want to talk about is fall decor you
guys don't know I did just do a DIY of
some fall decor that are super cute I
will leave that link down below and I
put them in my house and actually with
the Pier one in the middle of September
and got a bunch of stuff from Pier one
and I am obsessed with everything I got
I did an apartment tour so if you want
to see it I will leave it down below you
guys have been asking for that video for
like ever and I finally did it so I hope
you guys liked it it was different for
my channel I definitely wanted to kind
of put up a couple of different videos
that weren't necessarily just makeup
related something a little bit different
to kind of spice your interest or is it
spice or perk your interest you know
what I'm saying that is my first
favorite it's just the fall decor I've
been doing and the DIY is they've been
so fun I've made the little mason jar
flowers for my friends and my mother and
I just
love them I could literally make an SC
and just make them all day long is that
an idea no I don't have time for that
but if I could I totally would because
they're super cute
next thing gonna talk about is some
fashion items so the first thing are
these boots now let me go ahead and say
I know these are like a love and hate
kind of boot there was more positive
comments than negative on my Instagram
but honestly I don't care if you like
them or not because I think they cute
and I am in the south so I think they go
perfectly you know so this is what they
look like I got these from Kohl's
they're just so cute I wear these to
Ikea I'll insert a picture right here so
you can see it and I love these I just
felt like I was going to build something
which I was going to build something but
these just made it more you know fun and
interesting so I love them they're a
little bit more girly with the heel the
heel is not too high my friend Terina
actually saw these and she was like
Casey you did not I'm like watch me work
these just watch and she's deadly look
really cute so I was like see don't
knock it till you try it so I love these
they fit my style perfectly and you guys
know I cannot enjoy fall without some
combat boots and I bought every color in
these boots these are Steve Madden
combat boots I don't necessarily know
the names of them but these pair
actually came with the laces tied around
the middle part and I love them that way
I will not lace d Steve Maddens ones up
or the other two pairs that I have of
these because they look so edgy and just
kind of like grungy with the shoe laces
tie around the edges so when I wear them
this part kind of like pokes out like
this super cute I'll insert picture in
here for you guys to see because I did
do like a little snapchat outfit of the
day I'm thinking of starting a snapchat
for you guys so you can kind of see what
I've been doing it'll kind of be like a
little vlog I guess so if I create one I
will insert it in this video all right
here for you and down below so you guys
can follow me on snapchat because a lot
of you been asking about my personal one
but that is my personal snapchat so I'll
create a public one for you guys and
I'll leave it down below for you but I
love these I mean the grungy look that
it gives is so hot I wear this with
flannel and it looked super cute and
were the black ones with just a casual
like boyfriend sleeve shirt and it was
adorable so these boots are my favorite
Steve Madden I love them and I love tiny
laces around the middle of the shoe it's
so cute I just love them NextEra I want
to talk about is this necklace from
Urban Outfitters
I'm not really a silver kind of person I
like my watches gold and most of my
jewelry gold I used to be a silver
person but then I just kind of eased on
out of it but this necklace is gorgeous
and like I said it's from Urban
Outfitters so it kind of has like a
tribal theme to it every time I wore
this one it was like are you gonna try
but because your necklace looks like it
my answer always be yes I am I just love
this and it's so different it just
spices up any outfit if you have like a
casual top on you could throw this on
and it just looks so cute I got a ton of
compliments on this and I'm an Instagram
post that I had this with so love this
every Outfitters it is pretty expensive
but the quality is really nice and
nothing has fallen off which is perfect
okay and then I have a hair favorite
this is a caviar anti-aging perfect
texture finishing spray and it's free of
parabens plates and synthetic color I
love this caviar brand you can get at
Sephora
it is really pricey not gonna lie to you
I just really I really love this brand
I've been using their heat protectant
for forever now I actually included it
in my watch and get ready video I'll
link it down below if you want to see it
and I really feel like it has changed my
hair and the damage and stuff like I
just my hair is the best that it's been
in such a long time but this is a
perfect texture finishing spray so this
just add some texture which I definitely
need especially if I just wash my hair
my hair needs texture so like right now
I'm running on you know just washed hair
and just kind of spray it through add
some texture to it and add some body as
well so I just really love it
so really fine mist it's nothing too
crazy and it doesn't leave your hair
kind of straw like I guess you could say
really smooth but still holds everything
in place and adds a lot of body and
texture so I love this I love
this brand you guys have to check it out
so the last non makeup related item is
can you tell can you tell how much
volume I have right now my new
extensions it's about time I got some
extensions because let's be real
I'm at an extension since I highlighted
the ends of my hair because I didn't
have any to match and I didn't want to
get like random extensions like one
color because they would not blend with
my hair since I have like the ombre
balayage stuff so I am currently wearing
the Bellamy guys hanging of all iaj
extensions in the color number two to
number six and I really like these at
first I was a little skeptical because
they were a little bit more ashy than my
hair because my color is more warm but
you decided just to throw them in and
blend them and see how they would look
and then look phenomenal so I'm really
excited these worked out this is what
the I have one right here this is what
the extension looks like and the base
color matches my natural hair color
pretty much perfectly and then it just
goes into like the balayage highlighted
effect at the end and I love it I love
that these are a little bit more ashy
because I think it's perfect for winter
time it just kind of cools it down a
little bit and doesn't make it look as
summery
so I love these extensions they really
think they're the 220 gram extensions
and I had the 220 gram in the number two
when I was a dark brunette and I love
them I cannot tell you guys how excited
I am to have extensions back into my
life
because I love big hair and I'm just I'm
so excited these match so yeah okay
let's move on I just bit my tongue of it
that was attractive face rewind
okay so moving on to makeup the first
thing I want to talk about is something
I am super happy with this month I did
not think I was gonna like it as much
but I ended up loving it
it is a Smashbox photo finish foundation
primer oil free and this is the pore
minimizing one so this is what it looks
like really cute packaging I don't know
if you guys can tell but I've pretty
much put a nice little dent in this I
quit using the benefit Porefessional
just because I didn't feel
it really satisfied me anymore I kind of
felt like I used it for so long then
just kind of got tired of it the first
time I saw this was on a few people's
videos and every single person that had
tried this said they loved it and I was
like okay I'll go try it but like since
I have such oily skin especially here in
my t-zone I was kind of like it's gonna
be a oil slick it's kind of disgusting I
don't know if I want to deal with it but
this is perfect the oil free part is so
correct it does not make me super oily
this just really fills in your pores and
it's amazing I think better than the
benefit Porefessional I must have to say
and this is just phenomenal you guys
that you have bigger pores
I have very large pores right here you
probably can't see it on camera but I
have very large pores and they suck
this definitely camouflages them and
when you put your foundation on it looks
beautiful if you guys are wondering I am
still using the ex1 foundation look at
how much I've use of this I wasn't
kidding when I said I loved it so these
two together are amazing I haven't even
touched my hourglass primer since I got
this one in the beginning of the month
and I've just been loving it it is
pretty pricey though it's actually
really surprised at how pricey was I
think it's like 30 something dollars
next thing I want to talk about is my
lip combo I have had so many questions
on my lip combo this month and I love it
I'm glad you guys love it as well I just
cannot stop wearing it so the two of
these together is kind of like a weird
combination but they work together and
make it work and I love it I'm wearing
it right now so the first thing I take
is Mac swirl which you guys have heard
me talk about before absolutely adore
the shade I even loved it by itself it's
just a nice kind of rosy nude color very
pretty and then this is a newest
lipstick I got this month and this is
from the one step collection called so I
got for this eyeshadow it's called a
natural wilderness collection I believe
and this is in the color cyst now when I
first saw this color I was like
about that color and when i swatched it
it's definitely it's just different
it kind of is more of an ashy nude and
it kind of has a hint of green in there
which sounds a little bit disturbing but
these two together are amazing what I'll
do is I will line up my lips with whirl
and fill them in and the Cupid's bow and
a little bit more right here on the
outer part of my bottom lip and then
I'll apply this and then you know rub my
lips together mix it all in and then
apply a little bit more world here in
the outer corner and then I get this
color sometimes it turns out a little
bit more ombre which I really love and
sometimes it turns out like this which
is just like a mommy kind of ashy nude
and I love this a lot definitely give
the natural wilderness to collection a
try because I even have an eyeshadow to
show you guys that I've been loving this
color by itself on my lips it looks
really weird way too ashy and it just
kind of looks like I'm sick but pairing
it with whirl just looks gorgeous
speaking of that collection I got this
eyeshadow from them and I love it
this is in the color natural wilderness
and it's missing the top because Daisy
decided to chew on it so I have no idea
where it is
but this is the color right here it
reminds me so much of Bobby Brown's
camel so if this is still out it is
cheaper than that so I would go and pick
it up this does have a little bit of
shimmer in it and this is like a mustard
color with a tint of green in it again
it sounds kind of weird but I personally
love the color so that's what it looks
like right there you can kind of see the
natural wilderness collection is more of
kind of like a camo theme I actually
have it in my crease before I put the
darker shade in there and I love it I've
been using it every single day because I
purchased it another lip product I want
to talk about is this I got it from the
Mac of Sharon Osbourne collection again
you could probably find this on
Nordstrom or Macy usually they hold
stuff for quite a while after
collections have gone but this is the
only thing that I liked from the
collection and the see Sharon Osbourne
patent polish lip pencil and
french-kissed and this is just one of
those you know twist of lip products and
I keep this in my purse and this is just
a gorgeous darker nude very creamy on my
hand it doesn't
as pigmented like it looks a little bit
patchy but when I put it on my lips it's
just a really nice shade and it doesn't
look patchy at all and it's really nice
and moisturizing as well so that is what
is it :
French kiss from the Sharon Osbourne
collection I also want to mention my
velour lashes these I'm actually wearing
the girl you crazy ones right now if you
can ask anybody to any of my friends all
I wear is girl you crazy like I cannot
stop wearing them I just love them I
love the way they look on my eyes I just
can't French ones child there's brand
because it says it is Breast Cancer
Awareness Month and I thought it was so
awesome of them to make this into pink
packaging with a little ribbon and also
donate to the cause for every lash
purchase they will give a dollar to the
cause so you know one pack of lashes
they'll donate a dollar which I thought
was really nice they're contributing so
that's awesome and I just love this pink
packaging it's also on the box I mean I
probably won't throw these boxes away
because they are so cute so if you guys
are interested I also have a 15% off
coupon code for them so you can get 15%
off and they also donate to the cause as
well so I thought that was awesome go
you crazy is my favorite no matter what
my ride-or-die is girl you crazy they do
have a bunch of awesome lashes but my
opinion you can't top girly crazy
I'm just saying I also really quickly
once you shout out this mascara I think
I've mentioned it before but I just been
really loving it this month when I don't
wear false lashes
it's solorio miss manga voluminous
mascara and this is awesome I use this
more than my toothpaste it better than
sex mascara and it's just is perfect
doesn't smudge doesn't like have no
flakes underneath my eyes and I can even
use this on my bottom lashes and it
looks perfect so amazing mascara gives a
lot of volume and a level link I
actually got my friend Tarina on this as
well she's like I'm obsessed with it and
I was like I know right so before this
video ends I want to mention my favorite
songs because I just I love mentioning
to you guys my favorite songs
I don't know we just I don't know we get
on that level for song favorites the
first song is called 2 a.m. and it is by
was singing on Adrian Marcel let me just
tell you the song is bomb I love it
okay next song let's see is I have such
a like I'm so open to music like I love
so many different kinds of music this
one by Chris Brown called new flame is
my thing I have so many songs to share
with you guys this month Hoodie Allen
has been one of my favorite artists as
my love you guys do not know Hoodie
Allen leaving him down below I'll leave
all the songs down below
I love Hoodie Allen no interruption has
been my thing
love honey I've also been loving what's
that song dumb for you by him
okay an artist that I've actually been
obsessed with is called caked up he does
remixes and oh my gosh
every time I'm getting ready or whatever
I'm listening to him or if I'm working
out
this is who I listen to because he gets
me so pumped and let me show you my
favorite song of the moment all his
songs really are my favorite I just run
through the list when I'm working out
but this one it's just so good this song
by SIA if you are going through a
breakup you guys this song is for you it
makes you feel empowered and kind of
like get out there whenever I went
through of my breakup this was my
mindset I would go out have a good time
not give a damn about anybody because I
was having fun and it really encouraged
girls if you are going through a breakup
get out go out and have fun do not sit
at home and mourn whether you have
broken up with him he's broken up with
you go out have a good time you will
meet people I didn't have a lot of
friends when I when I went through my
breakup I just kind of take a minute to
say you know you will be okay I swear to
you you will be fine
a boy is not everything don't rely on
someone else for your happiness if
you're truly not happy with who you are
you will never find the perfect guy nor
will you be happy in relationship so
happiness starts from within
enjoy yourself love yourself if you are
young please enjoy being young I've
tried telling all my friends this if
you're young there is no need to settle
down right away I know if you have
settle down there's nothing against that
you're happy that's amazing I'm so happy
for you but if you are single and you're
like where's my husband don't have that
mindset enjoy your life just enjoy it
anyways

perfect if you're going through a
