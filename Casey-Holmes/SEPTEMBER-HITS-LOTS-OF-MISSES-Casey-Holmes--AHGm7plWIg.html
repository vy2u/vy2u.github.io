today I'm gonna be filming my hits and
misses for the month of September and I
have some hits but oh my gosh we've got
so many misses I even asked you guys on
my when I was it was Twitter asked you
guys on Twitter I even did a poll did
you guys want me to do like a full video
of the misses since there were so many
or just include them and make this a
super long video and a lot of you voted
to make this a super long video so I'm
glad you guys love long videos like I do
you're wondering about this makeup look
I did just film this it is my bridal
trial makeup look my second one so I
will leave it down below and a little
annotation up here because it is up
before this video and I love the way
that it turned out so if you want to see
what products I use you can head on over
there and I show you step-by-step do you
want to see this on my hit's and all my
dang misses and let's just go ahead and
get started so the first hit of the
month has to be these green nails now I
told you guys I don't know the exact
name but like olive green nail polish is
just calling to me I even want to do
like gold flakes on a ring finger one
day or something I'm just really feeling
fall nails I just I love fall first off
I don't really love the shape I'm more
of a coffin type of girl but I love this
color and I definitely think I'll be
doing like a burgundy and all of that
kind of stuff all of nails or I must
have and also since I don't know the
name of this I do know that Kathleen is
coming out with an olive green polish it
should be out now and it's pretty much
identical to this so I will leave a link
for that down below so I've been using a
different shampoo and a different
conditioner this month and I have been
really enjoying them so the shampoo I've
been using is this verb shampoo and
basically it says verbs see shampoo
gently cleanses hair adds body and
enhances waves for a natural tousled
look leaves hair volumous and with
touchable texture ahh
I don't really notice a lot texture but
I don't leave my hair like I don't let
my hair air dry ever because if I did my
roots get so freakin oily it's awful I'm
sure this cuz you light a texture for me
it just really cleans my hair makes my
hair feel super soft super smooth
another thing to also add on to that to
help keep it nice and smooth and look
pretty is definitely this igk expensive
i'm la oil high shine topcoat i think
that's how you say it i could be wrong i
was super nervous about this I didn't
know if it was gonna work or not this is
kind of a small bottle it's 4.2 fluid
ounces I feel like I've used quite a bit
of it but then again I still have like
this much left and I've used a lot of it
for the past months so I mean it's
probably not that bad but it says like a
top coat for nails UV protectant glaze
instantly forms to hair creating a
transparent weightless shield that adds
intense color depth and dimension I love
this product because again I feel like
this really makes my hair super smooth I
think these two together are just key
this really cleans the hair doesn't
weigh it down this adds a lot of shine
as a lot of moisture this really helps
keep it healthy and shiny and I like it
a lot I will say if you do not rinse all
of this out it is so heavy and it will
make your hair look kind of oily which
any conditioner will do that but really
make sure that you rinse this out or
else it's not gonna dry and it just
looks really gross and you have to wash
your hair again but I like to apply it
from like the top of my ears down and
I'm good to go and yeah so this is
another favorite of the month I've been
really enjoying it
got in PR I think it's great so my
favourite scent of the month has been
this one by shibashi it's Dalia Devon
where did I get this at I got this at
the duty-free section when I was in Fiji
at the airport oh my gosh I didn't know
this was new but its new you guys this
smells so good this is like my perfect
floral scent it's not like mature
smelling it's not super young it's just
that perfect scent I highly recommend
Olga highly recommend checking this out
because is by far my favorite set I have
tried yet let's move on to makeup so
first thing I want to shout out is the
Too Faced Just Peachy mattes palette I
had been using this so much since I did
a review on the full collection which I
will have linked down below but I really
love this palette first off I love matte
shadows and I think this is just a
really great staple palette to have if
you love these tones and if you love
matte shadows this is the palette for
you I think the packaging is really nice
I will say I find that before this pilot
to face was putting out like very subpar
eyeshadows that just weren't fun to play
with or fun to even look at like the
pallets were just not inspiring at all
but I really love this one I do a lot of
different looks with it I love an all
matte look you could do something
day-to-day but also do a really smoky
look for nighttime but this one and the
candy Johnson one I actually just tried
to candy Johnson one out yesterday so
I'm not included in this one cuz I
haven't used it online but oh my gosh
the candy Johnson one is so freakin good
next up I want to shout out this one
palette from the drugstore this is the
Melissa Michelle Ulta palette this is so
good you guys if you just want like a
fall palette that's affordable this is
the way to go I did do a full video
using this I did a full like fall makeup
look not too long ago anyway so these
are so pretty it's perfect for fall you
have a highlighter you have a blush and
it does come with a lippy that I've
already lost but it comes with that as
well and it's just a really great
product to get at the drugstore shadows
are really nice the gold ones a little
chunky but on the eye it is so stinkin
pretty ting being another one of my
favorites that is super pigmented I mean
the Matteson here gray Lola is really
great as well the little shimmery shade
though I highly recommend checking us
out again congrats to Melissa on this
palette it is beautiful and I think it's
really cool as she collabed with Ulta to
make it moving on to a face powder so I
have a few things from that two feet two
feet so I have a few things from that
Too Faced peach collection that I really
love and I also have some in my misses
for the month but this is the peach
perfect mattifying loose setting powder
I love this powder so much I think it
gives you a nice smooth finish smells
really good tastes good I mean I don't
recommend going like this but it does
taste really good if you get it in your
mouth and I just find that it lasts so
long on my skin and it also goes really
well with the foundation on Dacian has
also been one of my favorites too i just
combining them together gives a nice
smooth finish to the skin and i've been
really enjoying it this is a two-faced
peach perfect comfort comfort matte
foundation infused with peach and sweet
fig cream oil-free 14-hour wear oil
controlling and photo ready this looks
so good in photos
video as well actually wore this during
Fashion Week when I went a few weekends
ago and it looked so good and it lasted
for such a long time as well does it say
yeah 14 hour wear I agree with that
this lasted all day for me I would get
up in the morning do my makeup for work
wear it all day into the night and it
still looked amazing so really love this
product I think it's great I think the
packaging is really cute you do get a
pump with it as well and it's really
easy to travel with the color sand is
the perfect shape for me when I'm nice
and freshly self tan I use loving tan
self-tanner in the shade ultra dark
that shade matches absolutely perfectly
okay and then the last thing I want to a
shout out is this flower Beauty
highlight palette I have been using this
so stinking much this is just the best
drugstore highlight palette ever I mean
the formula is amazing they are super
reflective look at that there's nothing
like this in the drugstore white model
does have great highlighters but they're
not like this this is like super intense
in your face I actually have this on my
chest right now let me just look at that
do you there's nothing like this in the
drugstore by our Beauty is one of my
absolute favorite brand in the drugstore
because a lot of their stuff is really
great quality last thing I wanna mention
is this highlighter brush from Smashbox
this is a precise highlighting brush and
I love this because it is the perfect
size and it's like a duo fiber brush
here at the top I love this brush it
just sits right there on the top of the
cheekbone where you want to put it and
blend everything out beautifully this
has been my go-to over my honest Asya
won over any other highlighting brush
this has been my must-haves so now we
are moving on to our misses there's so
much stuff in here it's not even funny
the first thing I want to talk about I
love this brand for skincare I've used
their cleanser I use their moisturizer
right now and I just think they're a
great brand but this was a complete miss
for me this is the Dermalogica pre
cleanse balm I ran out of my clinic take
off the day cleansing balm which I have
to go get another one because I'm going
crazy without it this did not do
anything for
says it melts away impurities and makeup
from skin I had so much makeup left over
on my skin after this at first I thought
it was a cool concept because it's kind
of like the Clinique take off the day
balm you see how it's thick right there
but it's in a bottle form and it melts
down to like a oil consistency but it
doesn't take off like my mascara that's
not even waterproof it just doesn't make
any sense to me I got this in PR it was
just hitting my drawer waiting for me to
use
I used it did not like it at all gonna
mention the most controversial line ever
not controversial as in people are
always talking bad about it but what I
mean by it is if you talk bad about it
people come for you come for you got to
keep it real it's just how it is so I do
have all my 50 beauty products in here
that I don't like so the foundation was
a Miss for me if you want to know full
details and see my skin I will link that
video down below so you can check it out
I love the packaging of these I can't
wait to see her eyeshadow palettes
because I saw she was coming out with
more things October 13th
very excited to pick those up yeah these
were a Miss for me they were too drying
they accentuated my texture really
really bad and some people came for me
there was one person who was like wow if
that makes your skin look bad you must
have horrible skin I'm just like mama
didn't teach you any manners did she now
girl moving on the primer again this
just really didn't do anything for me I
mean it feels nice but it doesn't like
fill in my pores or make my skin look a
little bit smoother doesn't really help
with the longevity of foundation either
but this was a Miss for me as well as
this matchstick I think this was the
thing that I dislike the most because it
really makes your under eyes look so
cakey and dry it's just not pretty on
the skin so that was another miss for me
so next time I have this Smashbox photo
finish primer Iser primer and
moisturizer in one has hyaluronic acid
in it which is great adds a lot of
moisture to the skin I just I felt this
made me so greasy oh I made me so greasy
I could not use this as a moisturizer or
primer it was just too much for my skin
when my oils started coming through it
was just like a sliding mess it just did
not work if you have more combo dry skin
you might really like this because it's
a lot of moisture but for me it just
didn't work I mean I always apply
moisturizer anyways I even tried this as
a moisturizer and it just it just didn't
work it's just a little too much for my
skin so I'm gonna have to
on this but I know a lot of people love
it I was really excited to try it out
because I loved the primer water I would
check this out if you have really
dehydrated skin but for me it was just
it's just a pass another thing that
makes me look like a oil slick is this
Marc Jacobs invisible undercover
perfecting coconut face primer this
coconut line was a I believe limited
edition thing I love the bronzer from
the collection but this primer makes me
so greasy oh so greasy it doesn't even
take long at all I would say maybe one
and a half to two to look like a
complete disco ball I definitely this is
targeted more towards dry skin so if you
have dry skin I think you would like
this but my oily girls out there girls
don't even try it moving back to the Too
Faced collection the peach one we have
the peach blur here I did not like this
I felt like it did nothing for my skin I
don't even understand why this was in
the collection that sounds a little
harsh I didn't blur out any of my pores
didn't make my skin look smoother and to
be honest it didn't even look like I had
powder it just looks like a peach tint
that's what it's really weird it just
didn't work but instead of making me
look super smooth I feel like it brought
out more texture so just I feel like
there's some shimmer enos in there I
mean even when you look at it it has a
glow to it and then the other thing is
the sweetie pie radiant matte bronzer I
didn't like this for a bronzer if you
like more of a bronzey peach blush you
might like this there is quite a bit of
shimmer in here but I use this as a
bronzer because that's what it says but
I just didn't enjoy this especially as a
bronzer because it really looks like a
peachy bronze color all over your face
and it just doesn't look right so like I
said if you like these kinds of colors
for blush you might really enjoy it but
I think if they took out this peachy
shade I would have really liked it even
though it is more of a radiant bronzer
it's not like chunky glitter there's
just too much peach in it for me so the
next product that was a Miss is this
L'Oreal infallible Pro glow concealer
this burned the out of my eyes I
mean my skin was burning my eyes were
watering I did a full video and you guys
got to see like first hand it completely
making my eyes water instantly and it
was crazy so that's why I'm gonna have
to pass on this I don't even know really
how the wear is or
how bad it burned my eyes so I would
just be warned this burns the out
of your eyes another product in my
missus again from Smashbox I love the
contour side of these two cream contour
but I do not like the foundation so
that's why these are in here because I'm
just not a fan
I find oh by the way these are these
Smashbox Studios skin shaping
foundations again I think if you have
dry skin you might like this more for me
it just really made me super oily it
didn't want to stay in place and
personally if I'm gonna use a stick
foundation there has been nothing that
can beat my hourglass vanish stick
foundation even the hourglass one makes
me a little bit oily throughout the day
it still looks so much better than this
one I'm so sorry Smashbox I love you
guys this was just a Miss for me but the
contour side is really nice so maybe if
you have dry skin you would really like
this because I think my oils and this
foundation just did not work together
that's how I feel about those next up is
the Milani retouch and erase light
lifting concealer this just accentuated
texture and it had more of a medium
coverage which I didn't like it just
wasn't a favorite of mine it just looked
very cakey and not pretty whatsoever if
you're gonna do a drugstore concealer I
would recommend trying a Maybelline one
like the Maybelline better skin
Maybelline fit me think this is just too
much it's just too much you know okay
guys so that is it for my mrs. holy crap
I was a lot y'all that was a lot I gotta
figure out how to return half this stuff

music favorites this is the best part

name by baka not nice so Met Gala from
Gucci Mane okay what else can I shout

that's like the newest one that I have I
really like this one obviously because
it's owning the dogs I will also say I
haven't really been a big Blake Shelton
fan I don't know why like his past few
songs just haven't really made it to my
heart but this one's really good
