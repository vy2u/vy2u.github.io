today we are doing my September hits and
misses I have a few new hits and I
actually have quite a bit of misses it's
kind of like an even amount today so I'm
also going to include some of my music
favorites at the end of this video
because a lot of you like when I do that
and I personally love doing that as well
so that will be at the end of this video
quickly want to say don't forget to give
this video a thumbs up and subscribe to
my channel I will have a link right here
and also down below in the description
box just so you don't miss any videos
that I post I post three times a week
also I don't know when this video is
going up but there's like three days
left for my huge giveaway that I'm
having so if you have not entered I will
have all the details listed in the
description box below and if this video
goes up after the giveaway is ended I am
having a new giveaway so just stay tuned
just stay tuned okay so I want to start
with my very first favorite that I have
been loving this month and it is my
nails I've been doing this ombre natural
nail look this is the second time I just
got them done I refilled them yesterday
and oh I'm so obsessed with them so this
is what they look like if you follow me
on snapchat or my blog channel you have
seen them but I am so obsessed with this
nail look I think it is gorgeous
I think it's timeless and it matches
like every single outfit I don't know
about you guys but when I am in the nail
salon and I'm trying to find a color I
think about like the season what I'm
gonna wear and sometimes no color
clashes what you're wearing and I just
feel like this looks so feminine so
clean and just beautiful
I believe it's acrylic powder she uses
the acrylic pink powder and then the
white powder as well so these are the my
favorite I love them and now moving on
to a haircare product I did do a short
hair styling video or shorter some
people were kind of like coming after me
cuz it's like medium length hair which I
totally get I think I'm actually going
to chop off maybe an inch inch and a
half more soon I feel like it's growing
quickly I don't know anybody else maybe
just me I have been loving this living
proof full drive volume blast is instant
lasting volume and texture and I bought
these sample size because
you can find these sample size of this
or like the travel size because I didn't
know how it's gonna like it I did
purchase the travel size of the dry
shampoo from living proof and I just
don't like it so that's in my messes I
didn't like it at all that's why I
purchased the travel size of this but
I'm definitely gonna be getting the full
size because I love it for my shorter
hair adds just enough texture and volume
and it lasts for so long it's not
crunchy and it smells smells so good
your hair smells so freaking out now
let's go ahead and move on to skincare
the one thing I really want to talk to
you guys about I've been trying this out
for a couple months haven't really
discussed it just because I want to see
how well it works so I purchased the
foreo I believe this one's for oily skin
and I have been obsessed with this
product I feel like it has transformed
the texture of my skin and I have not
broken out as bad at all with this
product I feel like it really gives me a
nice deep clean but the main thing that
I notice about it is the texture of my
skin is just so much better it's so much
smoother and I feel like when I use this
my cleanser really gets into my skin and
cleanses and then my moisturizers and
eye creams on top just really absorb
into the skin and I love it I purchased
this because it's all kathleenlights
mention us in a video a long time ago a
long time ago I purchased this because I
was like okay it's silicone it's not
going to hold bacteria it's easy to
clean and I just love it I don't really
use this side at all I just stick with
this side and I use the first setting
which I think is the highest setting I'm
probably going to do a morning routine
very soon and I will include this in
some other skincare that I've been using
for you guys and show you that in action
just stay on the lookout but I have been
obsessed with this I know it's super
expensive but holy crap I have not gone
a day without using this the next thing
I want to talk about is this it
cosmetics bye bye under eye eye cream
and it claims to smooth brighten and
deep puffs this is what it looks like
this came in a PR package now I do have
one item from this PR that I got that I
absolutely do not like too
which I'll tell you about more towards
the end of the video when I mention my
missus but this product I really do like
I use a la Prairie eye cream now since
I've been using this I use a la Prairie
one at night just to save more of that
product because it is so expensive I
love it but I'd rather use it at night
than in the morning so I've been using
this every morning I love it it's kind
of a thicker cream it feels really good
underneath the eyes it's kind of a
cooling sensation and I do feel like it
really smooths out that area and
concealer and everything else I put on
top just glides I don't really have a
problem with puffiness underneath my
eyes I just noticed that smooths and
hydrates my under eye very very well and
I have been enjoying this a lot next
thing you want to talk about is by renn
this is a flash hydro boost instant
plumping emulsion I probably sound like
a like a dumbass because I can't get
that word right basically it's for all
skin types
I kept the box because it kind of tells
you more about on the box then on the
tube so basically it's a water charging
hydration booster designed to work in
harmony with the skin to prevent the
aging effects of dehydration or Tyler on
acid in it to maximize moisture levels
by helping to draw in water locking into
the skin for an instant plumping effect
so basically uses to prevent fine lines
all kinds of stuff like that if you're
feeling really dry you use this product
it's just gonna help hydrate and plump
that skin up and I love this this is a
lifesaver if I've been at the lake and
my skin is super dehydrated especially
like being out in the Sun all that kind
of stuff even with an SPF 50 on my face
my face gets really dry and just
dehydrated so this is the perfect
product for that it just really smooths
everything out I've been telling you
guys so far in this video that my skin
has become a lot smoother due to the
foreo and other products i've been using
and this is definitely one of the
products this kind of keeps up with that
korean beauty trend that everybody loves
because it has water as like a key
skincare ingredient so basically you do
your cleanser all of that you apply this
all over your face and then you take
water on your fingertips and massage it
into the skin and that's what activates
it and that's what really gets it deep
into the skin and really plumps and
hydrate you can use it before your
moisturizer as like your daily routine
you can apply it at night and it is for
all skin types so for my oily skin I've
been really loving it I've noticed such
a huge difference with the moisture of
my skin gnorm
when you have oily skin you think oh I
don't need moisture I have enough
because I'm oily basically it's the
opposite you need more moisture you need
to put that back into your skin because
your skin is thinking that it's not
getting enough so it's just putting more
and more oil out so it's important to
really moisturize my lovely skin girls I
don't moisturize been there done that
make sure you're doing Wooster eyes it
makes the biggest difference in the
world I've been using the R in skin care
a lot this month they have some stuff
for redness that I've been trying out
and loving but I've been really really
enjoying this product it does have a
pump which is amazing oh it does kind of
look like a cream but again you just
won't apply it all over take some water
on your fingertips and use it to really
blend into the skin you feel this and
you're like oh it's just a moisturizer
but the water is the key ingredient to
really make all this work and really
sink into the skin plump it up keep it
from aging and looking dehydrated
another great thing about it is smells
like a spa honestly you you just can't
get past it and it feels so good on the
skin one thing I want to mention that
I've talked about a lot this month is a
Too Faced glitter glue I'm obsessed with
this I used to have the older one that
had like older packaging they redesign
the packaging of this which I love I do
have the older packaging but it was time
to throw that out because it was old I
do like this new packaging I think it's
really sleek and this is amazing if you
want any shimmery eyeshadows to stay all
day any glitter
loose glitter glitter eyeshadows
anything like that this is a life saver
it's my all-time favorite I love it so
much so again the Too Faced glitter glue
is a must-have especially for the
holidays coming up you want to have a
fun glittery look this is a must-have
because it will stay all day long and
then really quickly I'm going to mention
some tools I've been loving this
japonesque brush this is a bigger kabuki
brush I forget what they call this it's
a it's a different kind of name but
these are great dupes for the NARS
brushes that look like this it's so soft
I've also been loving this anyway which
you can get at CVS this is the contour
and highlighting brush I think this is
awesome I love brush on the end this
kind of dome shaped brush where it's
easy to contour then you also have this
one right here which is great for like
blush or you can use this for contour
and this for highlight I mean you could
do whatever with this dual ended brush I
love it and it's really soft and applies
product amazingly and also blends
product so well highly recommend the MUA
brand for brushes neck
I want to shout out the benefit 3d brow
tones I think this is so cute this gives
me Britney Spears vibes with her circus
album and all of that I just love it I'm
using the shade to hike at first I
thought I had to read under here but
it's just literally right here on the
side so this is a shade too and I love
this product it has little spiky parts
at the end and it's spiky all the way
around basically this is like a
highlighter for your brows so you just
comb it through your brows and it adds
just different tones where it looks a
lot more natural so if you feel like you
went a little bit too dark with your
brows or you're just feeling like your
brows don't look super natural this
product is so good I love the
highlighted effect that it gives it
makes it look more natural and it's just
such a beautiful product I've been
really really enjoying it and like I
said I'm in the shade too I used the
number three for my brows all the time
like this pomade but I went a little
lighter with this just because I really
want to get that like nice highlighted
effect and like lighten them up a little
bit to kind of match my hair so this
combo number three pomade number two
brow tones it's good stuff okay guys we
have a few more favorites this one is
the Marc Jacobs blush in lines and last
night I'm not a big fan of the name uh
that's just my personal preference I
don't think that's I know NARS has like
orgasm and all of that but I don't know
I'm just not a big fan of this name I
just love this color I think it goes
with so many different looks and it's
just beautiful it's just like a nice
kind of coral nude shade and I love the
fact that you can kind of adjust the
color you can get a little bit more of
the coral down here or you could get a
little bit more of the nude down here so
it's one of those products that you can
customize with whatever look that you're
doing the powder is really really soft
and blends so well honestly that swatch
doesn't know justice putting on cheeks
it just looks absolutely beautiful and
like a soft focused blush stunning so
love this I also love the packaging I
think Marc Jacobs does a great job with
his makeup packaging okay to eyeshadow
palettes that I have just oh there's
dust with been obsessed with these are
so good the Urban Decay Naked ultimate
basics palette yes I love this Wow
it this is me in a bad way you know like
a mats warm neutrals it's just my
you know what I mean I really love that
I mainly focus on this bottom row right
here honestly I'll use these colors
sometimes these are a little bit more
cool tone I like the shades right in
here I think it's a beautiful palette
it's great I absolutely love the
packaging of this and the mirror is Jai
Norma's it's absolutely huge I just love
this the shadows blend really really
well but I will say if you have like a
buttload of neutrals in your collection
and you're just like do I really need
another neutrals palette
you probably don't you probably already
have these in your collection and you're
probably happy with them as well so this
is not like day oh my god go run out and
get it right now but it's a great
palette I've been really enjoying it and
I think it's beautiful this is like one
of those palettes I can use when another
palette doesn't have like a nice mid
tone shade or nice black which I'm about
to show you in a minute I will use this
palette to take with me as well and it's
gorgeous so I did a full video on this
next palette and it's so expensive but
damn it I've been using it a lot and I
love it and if you want to see a full
detailed review I will link that video
right here in a card and also down below
in the description box and this is the
Natasha de Nonna green brown palette are
you ready oh my god it is so pretty you
guys I just I know it's expensive
someone did the math for me it's like
850 per shadow which is actually very
good they're made with real crushed
pearls and I think that's so awesome
these are more moisturizing eyeshadows
which is great they're creamy they're
beautiful they last so long on the lid
and I've been using the glitter glue
with this palette a ton this month and I
just love it it's worth it it's worth it
like I said in that review video if you
are not one to experiment with your look
you don't want about this palette okay
you do not want to buy this if you don't
like to experiment or play with shimmers
or anything like that but if you love
makeup and you love to have fun and you
love to try new things try colors and
just get a little bit more bold with
your look you would be obsessed with
this she also has a purple blue palette
if you like more of those colors this is
my kind of palette I mentioned in that
video and bummed that this does not have
a black because home girl needs a black
in almost every palette but again I have
like the Urban Decay Naked basics
palette or I have my original lorac
palette that I can go into for a nice
black very last thing I want to mention
to you guys you're not going to be
surprised about but it is the Smashbox
always on liquid lipstick and True Grit
this is my perfect brown for fall you
guys I am obsessed with it that is one
swipe these are pigmented you know I
love the formula these are by far my
favorite liquid lipstick formulas ever
just oh they're so good and this color
is my favorite so it's just a nice Brown
right there anyways my memory card that
full and I don't know what I was saying
but I love it you can see it's now dried
matte it's just such a beautiful color
it's not streaky it's just it's so fun
to experiment with your look with this
you could do a really nice smoky eye you
could do an eye like this and put this
on your lips and it just pops I love
this color in True Grit it's just
amazing I mix it with different colors
to make them deeper everything like that
for fall and winter
you need this product all right let's
get on to the misses and start off with
these two things that I mentioned on
snapchat if you don't follow me on
snapchat you should I'll leave it right
here think these were something that I
could not work with at all so this is
the Lancome tint idol ultra wear makeup
stick it has SPF 21 it says all day
color wear stuff I would like to say
when I applied this I did not see a soft
matte finish whatsoever I was actually
pretty dewy I'm not super dewy with like
an intense luminous glow but I did have
some glow to my skin and I was not a fan
of that this looked so bad on my pores
my texture my rosacea it just did not
work for me I couldn't I couldn't do it
you guys I could not get past applying
it looking at my skin and being like
what the actual hell happened with this
foundation it did cover really well it
blended really well it's very very
creamy but man no ma'am no ma'am no
ma'am did not work my texture right here
we just pop it at product from Lancome
and this one are a part of my expensive
ass luxury makeup all that I'll be doing
soon that I've been reviewing and trying
out for the past
weeks that video is going to be
disappointing as hell so just wait for
my next one because May I could not get
some good stuff this time
so this one is the Tom Ford concealing
pin and it's beautiful packaging blah
blah blah and then you open it up and
you have the sponge applicator which I
do not mind there's a little hole on the
top where you can just click it out and
the concealer comes out and you just
apply it's really easy to apply it's
just such a sick concealer it's the
weirdest thing and it's so thick and
weird that it's it's streaky on the skin
and I don't like it that swatch makes it
look good but girl you put this on your
skin it is gross it looks so streaky it
looks like you have a hella lot of
concealer on when really you really
didn't put that much on okay you but I
put my normal amount of concealer on
which yes it's a lot but damn this
looked like I put on half the bottle on
my face I could not work with this it
was so hard to blend it was just way too
much for me so this tomforde concealing
pin no big on to to kind of
disappointing things these are just
things that I regret purchasing that did
not work for me
so if you follow me again I'll snapchat
you know that I was beyond excited to
get this product I was looking for this
product I even put my email and the
notify me went back in stock when it was
out of stock at Sephora I never do that
that's how you know I wanted this
product so this is the belief believe in
truth problem solutions toner for
trouble skin yes contains tea tree oil
yes mineral oils no basically it tells
you all the things it doesn't have and
then there's only one thing it does have
which is tea tree oil at the top and
basically it says it's supposed to calm
and balance trouble and sensitive and
all these skin types let's make the
model formula of natural herbal extract
soothes and moisturizes the skin without
any irritating additives hmmm man I use
this for a good couple weeks morning and
night first thing I did not see a
difference with my skin
I wasn't breaking out less I wasn't less
red I just didn't notice the difference
you know what I mean I wanted to see a
difference with the redness mainly
because it did have tea tree oil in it
and not supposed to help it didn't sue
that all this actually
- worse and it stung my skin like so bad
I don't know if I'm the only one that
that's happened to but it's some so bad
when I put on my skin I would apply it
it would feel like a cooling sensation
like a normal toner but then just to
start stinging and then I would get like
a lot of redness in my forehead it was
splotchy redness so I knew it was my
rosacea really reacting and it was
pissed off this was the first thing I
would put on and that's when I would
notice it so I hate that this kind of
did the opposite to my skin it didn't
really heal anything it didn't really
soothe or anything like that it just
kind of irritated my skin in my rosacea
maybe if you don't have rosacea you just
have oily problematic skin you might
like this but it did not work for me
flared everything up and I looked like a
hot damn mess next thing is a makeup
product and I purchased this and I was
so excited about it and I don't know
just playing with it it's just not worth
it in my opinion I feel like you could
buy drugstore blushes drugstore palettes
like the one from makeup revolution and
get kind of like the same effect
this is divides art blush palette in a
plum bronze now the shades are beautiful
it's my kind of palette you know I love
these plums I love the Browns over here
couldn't even use this to contour
honestly so it looks like they have a
great formula Bazaar has a really really
great formula for eyeshadows for their
blushes all of that I personally do not
like the pan size I find that I just I
can't just use one shade I have to
either mix two or I have to squeeze my
brush and dig it in there which I don't
really like doing that's one thing I
don't like about this palette and I
don't know it's just when I apply it to
my cheeks I just don't see anything like
wow this is supposed to be worth all
that money it's not I don't I don't get
that vibe I'm not over the moon about it
I don't think it's like a must-have
palette I'm not saying it's a terrible
palette because it has a great formula
great colors they also have another
palette with different colors but this
was the shade that I wanted was a Miss
for me not a big fan mainly because of
the price tag if it was about like $25 I
would be okay with it but it's not it's
not actually how much is it buys art
blush palette bys are really see Reno
these are $80 like the eye shadow so
okay so the last thing that broke me out
and that I will not put my fingers in
ever again is this it cosmetics buy my
makeup three and one makeups melting a
cleansing balm now this is what it looks
like you can see I gave it a fair try
I was thinking no there's no way this is
what's freaking me out
yes it is I was using this I used the
belief thing before I ever touched this
and this did not break me out okay it
didn't solve any breakouts but it did
not break me out this girl I put this on
my face and I used it for a couple
nights and all of a sudden I had these
terrible underneath the skin breakouts
that were so painful it couldn't pop
them you couldn't do anything they're
just sitting there like a big-ass lump
on your face and they came out of
nowhere girl I use this for just a
couple days and it was like done I also
had small little pimples as well but oh
my god I had the worst ones right here
if you check out my ultimate full makeup
tutorial you can kind of see I was like
three days after I first got that
breakout and it was still raised it was
painful it was this bad boy I quit using
this and girl did it clear up it cleared
up within probably two to three days I
would say because obviously they were
such bad breakouts like I could not take
it I just I even quit wearing makeup for
a while does melt away everything but I
don't know what's in it I need to look
up the ingredients and everything
because I don't know what's in it that
problem that made me break out so bad
never touching this again I've had high
hopes for it I honestly did but I've
been using the Boscia cleansing balm and
I used that before this one and that was
really great it's a little bit tougher
to have it melt into the skin and melt
all that makeup but it does the job my
all-time favorite one is the Clinique
take off the day cleansing balm that's
my ultimate favorite this does melt a
little bit easier than the Clinic one
but if it's gonna break you out no I
don't know if it's just because my skin
is so sensitive that there's an
ingredient in that that just was like no
to my skin um but just be warned called
hella breakouts okay sorry okay now
