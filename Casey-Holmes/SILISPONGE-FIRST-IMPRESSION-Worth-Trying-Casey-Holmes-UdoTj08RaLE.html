is going to be a highly requested video
that I'm filming for you and it is
demonstrating the silly sponge now I
have not used it when I opened my
package I used a knife so I cut off the
top of it I have not used it yet and I
wanted to use it on camera for you guys
I'll supposed to do this like a few
weeks ago but eh I was out of town for a
while and it didn't come and when I'm
supposed to
so don't pay extra in shipping because
it doesn't come what it's supposed to
feel like YouTube was so saturated with
this at the time that I just kind of
decided to wait a little bit hopefully
you're still interested in seeing my
opinion on this silicone sponge well
silicone applicator right now my skin is
breaking out so incredibly bad it's
either the new went wild foundation or
my Urban Decay D slick primer both of
those got my skin effed up yesterday I
have to do a mask tonight I'm probably
going to wash all this makeup off and
then do a mask and right here yeah
that's not blended very well because I
got my scare up there and I had to take
a q-tip to it so just like it like a hot
dip it's okay so we're just going to go
in and try this product out I have my
regular primers on so I'm just gonna
kind of roll with it I am very not
self-tan right now I need a self-tan
tonight you can see how intense my
redness is compared to like my chest and
stuff isn't that crazy I'm gonna just
use my regular foundation that I have
been using it's a Sonia Kashuk soft
focus satin matte foundation how do you
know that I love this it's just my
favorite I'm gonna try with this first
and if it doesn't work out I'll try to
find a different foundation that matches
me because right now I don't really have
a shade that matches this color other
than the white wild one but I don't want
to try the wet and wild again we're
gonna try it with this one first I'm a
little nervous because this is more of a
matte finish but we'll see how it blends
onto the skin I would think that this
would work better with like a dewy
foundation or something we shall see
just open this little baggie up this is
what it looks like it's kind of cool
that's not a sponge that way it is super
easy to clean and I feel like it's gonna
last a little bit longer whoa that it's
cool
it does feel cool whoo oh it feels so
nice this is a shade o to denim using
right now sometimes I mix just depends
on what kind of color I am I think this
is gonna match me right now and I'm just
gonna just going to dive right into it
okay so I'm going to take some of it on
the silicone
and we're gonna do this at my face first
it's feels so weird now I do like beauty
blunders oh I don't know looks like it's
not necessarily blending it in maybe I
used too much product take something on
my forehead but a little bit like this
think people are just giving this a lot
of height because it's something new and
different okay what we're going to do is
we're going to do one side with this and
then we're going to do one side with a
sponge so we could all see the
difference oh it's just like you have to
keep blending and keep blending and keep
blending it shows an assload of texture
like I don't know how it's doing that
and it's not covering my redness
variable I feel like it takes a lot
longer to blend out I mean it's starting
to blend out now but I feel like it just
takes forever we're also going to try
concealer with this I don't know if
you're supposed to but we're going to
test it out normally I don't go
underneath my eyes a foundation but
right now I have no choice okay so it is
working you just have to keep really
blending it into the skin how does it
say to do it we're blend until coverage
is even so you're just supposed to do
what I'm doing basically and really just
spread it out until you're blended it
wasn't weird on my forehead I feel like
it's making my foundation look patchy on
my forehead which does not happen with
this product we add a little bit more
trying to do half of my face here who's
not looking cute by the way if you're
wondering my eyeshadow is this persona
eyeshadow pot is the identity palette
it's really really nice I'll leave it
down below in the description box I feel
like the bottom half of my face looks
decent but I'm not the biggest fan
because I feel like it kind of took away
some of the coverage you can kind of see
right here that like my purple red
rosacea is peeking through and I don't
like that I'm going to go wet my
japonesque sponge and I'll be right back
see how much easier it's so easy just to
blend out and look you can already tell
the difference like do you see how much
more coverage this side has on this side
I'm going to kind of go over everything
right here and I really feel like the
Beauty Blender does not show the tech
like look at the difference between this
side and this side the side looks
half-assed this side looks good and this
is a japonesque sponge this is not like
the full price Beauty Blender so this is
a really great sponge you get it all to
see like this side makes me hate the
foundation this eye makes me love it I
don't like it I don't like it I'm so
sorry moly cosmetics it's so cool to
come out with something different I
totally get it but I mean I think right
here this side-by-side comparison just
speaks for itself
anyways I'm gonna go in with concealer
now I'm gonna quickly do this side of my
face with my Beauty Blender since
already have it in my hand
look at how that eye shadow I got my in
there my inner corner of my eye tell you
right now that silicone sponge is not
gonna get in there so take this right in
here cover-ups in that darkness now I
don't know if this is for your under
eyes probably not but I mean I figured I
would try it these sponges are a
two-in-one kind of product so why not
try this as like a tool one product you
know what I mean this just feels so
wrong I don't know what it is it just
feels so wrong and I feel like such a
hater for this video but damn good okay
this is actually going a little bit
better than I expected it's gonna take
me forever to get in the inner corner so
that obviously added more coverage try
not to ruin this wing that I worked so
hard on I feel like the sponge side
still looks better that's what it looks
like with the silicone sponge on this
side I feel like concealer went a lot
better than I expected it to to be quite
honest with you and it did cover up all
that redness that did it didn't cover in
the beginning that way well I'm going to
do the rest of my face with the silly
sponge I'm just going to highlight down
my nose with the Tarte take the better
skin and put it on the other areas where
I want to highlight because I really
like to a lighter
creamier concealer on places I want to
highlight other than my nose my nose I
like to use that Tarte one just because
I know it stays put all day long but for
the other areas I just use something
light I mean it is working but just feel
like it's a lot more work
I have a feeling blending this on my
nose is going to be very difficult
okay let's try wiping some of it off I
like that it gets right down the center
of the nose but I'm working my ass off
to plan this out oh it looks terrible my
forehead can you see that no we're not
doing that to myself today okay so I'm
going to finish the rest of my face and
then I'll be back to give you guys a
final update okay guys so I am done with
my makeup now if you want to know what
I'm wearing I will have it listed in the
description box below
but I'm quickly going to give you my
final thoughts on the silly sponge I do
think it's a good idea I just don't
think it's practical for me personally I
do not see myself gravitating towards
this honestly this is the only time I
will probably ever use it I'm probably
going to give this to a friend or
somebody who wants to try it after this
video because it's just not my thing
I love swishing it I think it feels
really really cool I just don't think
it's practical and I think it takes a
lot longer than using a Beauty Blender
but if you want to use less product and
you don't mind taking the time to do
your makeup you might like this I
definitely liked it more after I put on
my concealer but I do feel like this
side is a little bit more flawless in
this side even though this side does
have more texture I just feel like even
though this side has texture everything
just went on a lot more smoother and a
lot a lot quicker but we do know that
this can blend out concealer as well I
just can't get right in here into the
inner corners that's a plus as well but
you cannot bake with those are my
thoughts on the silly sponge I
personally would never use it again but
you know there's some people out there
that find this stuff really cool and
really handy and if it doesn't soak up
product it might be for them let me know
