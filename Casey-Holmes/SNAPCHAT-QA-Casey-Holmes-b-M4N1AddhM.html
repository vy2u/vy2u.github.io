tutorial and I wanted to film a snapchat
Q&amp;amp;A because I love Q AIDS and I want to
do something with snapchat so I asked
you guys to send me some snaps and I
haven't done like a snapchat thing on my
channel since I was in my apartment last
year that's too damn long oh she's so
pretty oh my god girl you're killing it
um how'd it get over your first breakup
it's it's just one of those things where
you kind of have to keep yourself busy I
know at first it really sucks surround
yourself with new people and just people
who are gonna lift you up because if you
constantly go back to that person or if
you constantly think about them it's
just gonna be even harder so go out
enjoy yourself have fun I mean really
embrace being on your own - I think
that's like one of the best parts about
being single is being by yourself
constantly and I just think you should
really really embrace it
you look gorgeous without makeup you're
really pretty eyes um three favorite
nude lip products I would say give me
like those I guess all them three of my
favorites that I just picked out our
this one the lorac pro this isn't peep
toe I used to love this all the time you
swear at a ton I just don't really love
it but it's a really pretty pinky nude
and I just I think it's amazing a great
nude lip liner is this one from a
Lancome
it's the lipstick crayon and nude tan
well I have to sharpen it so I haven't
used it but it's a really pretty color I
wish I could swatch it for you but
definitely go to a Lancome counter and
swatch that is amazing and for drugstore
I love this color by Maybelline and clay
crush oh my god it's so pretty and it's
matte so oh I love that color that's
probably my favorite out of all three
though to be quite honest with you
I don't know you know every time we come
back to fall I just I just loved our
clips and I love the fact that as the
years go on people are like embracing it
more and more I just have saved our
clips every single time I mean there's
nothing I look forward to more than a
nice dark lip I'm talking like almost
black I like super dark lips so that has
to be my favorite let me know if y'all's
favorite is down below in the comments
cuz I wanna know what you guys love the
most go girl oh do you see um by a
promise ring and they've never met each
other and they're no long distance
relationship I think if it makes you
happy okay
um for me if it was me in that situation
I would not want that because a promise
ring means like something close to an
engagement ring and I would not want to
promise myself to someone if I've never
met them before so I personally wouldn't
do it but if it makes them happy I would
say do you think um when I'm alone and
I'm having a bad day what I like to do
the most out of everything is just go
for a ride and get out of my house if I
can't leave I usually just play with my
dogs and let go out on the porch and
listen to really great music I'll just
blare it I'm a very Intune person and
what really helps with me is music or
just like the air like I feel like it
sounds really weird but my Jeep has
helped a lot and when I got it like in
certain situations where I feel like I
just wanted to really get away I would
just take the top off roll the windows
down and it just felt good to go on back
roads I like nature I like music things
like that or I'll even talk to like one
of my girlfriends and we'll go out to
lunch or something or even my mom my mom
is really great I love having my mom
around to talk to you so you could go to
lunch or something with them and it
it helps me a lot how many pairs of
shoes do you own I'm actually in the
process of clearing out my shoes right
now
I'm switching everything over from
summer to fall and I'm getting rid of a
lot of stuff as well but um I did a
roundup of how much and how many shoes I
had before I moved and it was a lot I
don't know if I'd do a shoe collection
because those videos don't get like
really good responses I don't know
people just get really upset by them and
I don't want it to come off as bragging
in any way shape or form so I don't know
if I would ever do a shoe collection but
I do have over-under pairs
I'm waiting for that question ever since
I said his age I've been waiting for it
um first off for your hair I tell you
what my hair like I was blond at one
point and it was so dry I'm telling you
what not washing it every day helps a
lot dry shampoo is my life I just
watched it today it's Sunday and before
that I didn't watch it till Wednesday
I watched it Wednesday I haven't washed
it since today which is Sunday so I go
quite a few days without it and I'm
telling the macadamia deep repair mask
is like my life it's my life and the bee
bee and the bumble and bumble little
shampoo the invisible oil one swear by
it I haven't
I just blow-dried it today I haven't
straighten it or anything and I just I
love the combo of those two for my hair
and dating a 22 year old when he first
told me his age I was like you've got to
be kidding me cuz I don't know if you
guys remember but in a video I think it
was like a Q&amp;amp;A a while back I was like
oh I keep getting these young guys and
I'm so over it and I just got another
young guy but he's completely different
he he has manners that are
expected with these younger guys
especially the ones that I've dated if
it wasn't for him being a gentleman and
opening the doors and doing everything
that I've always wanted I wouldn't talk
to him I mean I've noticed now I can't I
can't judge by the age I have to judge
by how they treat me in their
personality so it happened I don't know
how a girl but it did yeah definitely
the Bumble and Bumble was it called
bubble bubble invisible oil shampoo
macadamia deep repair mask for my hair
and then I still use the kinder platinum
plug blow dry spray and then I've also
been using the bumble and bumble
invisible oil like heat protectant spray
before I blow dry my hair and that's all
I do I think I keep my routine down to a
minimum and I kind of use the same
products for a while so it's just been
working for my hair and I just love it
thank you so much it's so sweet umm and
what I would wish for is to have my own
rescue shelter like my own no-kill
shelter I would love to have one and I
was I would wish to have one and like
really easily you know and have the
money for that so that's one of the
wishes I would have another wish I would
have is to have my mom feeling healthy
again that's something I haven't
discussed with you guys but um she
hasn't been feeling well for a while now
so that would be my next wish for her to
be healthy and for her to feel good and
then my last wish would be to just world
peace is so cliche but something where
people would just be nicer to each other
you know what I mean like I would wish
that people would not take time out of
their day to be so hateful to certain
people you know so that would be my next
one those are my three wishes and if I
could have all of those I would be set I
would be really happy I'd be one happy
girl
you ever consider doing a video on like
life tips and life hacks because your
girl gets super stressed and sometimes
makeup doesn't solve my problem oh and
by the way I love you so much you're
such an inspiration to me motivate me on
the daily and the day you follow me on
Twitter I celebrated with pizza yes
that's my kind of girl
um yeah I would love to do like a life
hacks had the video I did like a packing
hacks alone but I think life hacks would
be fun just like little things that I do
to like get me through the day I guess
you could say especially like I'm like
having a bad day like what are the
certain hacks that have to do and you
know what are we used for like a bath or
something if I want to take one so I
definitely would do that but thank you
so much for the sweet words I really do
appreciate it and you look glam tonight
girl you look glam I love it my biggest
insecurity um I would say every single
time it goes down to pores like I hate
having pores I know that's so stupid and
I'm gonna have it for the rest of my
life but having larger pores with oily
skin just really sucks
and it's something I'm always insecure
about and I'm like okay are people
looking at me are they looking at my
pores like what's going on so I would
say that I know that's something I can't
fix but it's just always been an
insecurity of mine sure um I would
definitely do these Sony ones like these
cameras from Sony the ones that flip up
because they have amazing quality and
they are priced eithe I think they're
like five or six hundred dollars very
pricey but it autofocuses really well
has amazing quality and you could
probably like me set with this for a
really long time on YouTube I just I
think these are awesome so I would
definitely recommend this Sony I think
it's like next 500 or something but they
haven't met Best Buy and you can kind of
play with different ones and see which
one you like best
I have two different versions and I love
both of them a lot
favorite band NSYNC probably it I don't
know
NSYNC and Backstreet Boys those are like
my two that I always went back and forth
with so instinct of Backstreet Boys I
can't pick which was probably NSYNC more
but then Backstreet Boys I don't know
those two I can't just pick one I'm just
so excited for fall fashion oh my god
the so excitement fall fashion I'm
excited to layer I'm excited to wear
different coats and like capes and try
out different trends that are new this
year so definitely the fall fashion I am
really big into clothes really big in
the shoes and I love trying new things
and I feel like fall is like the best
time to try new styles because I don't
know layering and stuff you can make it
your own so definitely fall fashion but
my house caught fire and I only had one
makeup product to take um mascara yeah I
would do mascara I was thinking
foundation I feel like that's really not
okay because I would need to set it add
concealer um I my house on fire I would
definitely take my scare because it
would just be easy and something I can
use without any makeup and still look a
little bit put together this one's from
Brooklyn buffa she said do you plan on
getting a fourth dog and when Gorge you
guys have had like amazing makeup
tonight um I would love a fourth dog but
I think the time that I will get a
fourth dog is if I right now I need to
chill enjoy my three dogs that I have
but I think if I get a fourth dog if
things work out with me and my boyfriend
well on in the next year or something
and we end up moving in together within
a year year and a half then he would get
another dog and that would be our fourth
dog so probably be a golden retriever
but it probably won't be for a couple
years a couple couple years
saying that you were most adamant about
finding when you find the lead down your
boyfriend I feel like I can really
relate because I was engaged before as
well and I thought I would never date I
would know nothing but that ain't found
thanks ever so
congratulate oh thank you so much let me
replay the first one real quick and see
what that one was first off thank you so
much Rachel the most can I just say okay
I was watching my video of I'm on tinder
it was my vlog and I was looking at this
I've no I was listening to myself when I
was talking at the table about what I
wanted in a guy and I said in that video
I was like I just feel like I'm gonna
run into him like I feel like I'm not
gonna expect this guy whoever it is it's
just gonna be it's just gonna happen and
I got chill cuz I was like holy crap
that is exactly how I met my boyfriend
and the one thing I needed the most out
of a new guy was for him to be a
gentleman I feel like I just wanted a
Southern gentleman you know I didn't
want to play like these little games
with guys anymore and you know I didn't
I wanted something serious if I was
gonna date somebody and I got myself a
gentleman and I'm so happy and thank you
so much I'm so happy that you found
someone too because it's definitely
interesting to go from engage to single
and it's very it's very crazy really
cool to see other girls like that that
go through like the same situations as
you so that's awesome and I'm really
happy you found someone 100 100 100
percent the makeup forever Matt's
eyeliner where is it I just used it
today so I can't oh there it is yeah the
makeup forever liquid liner and it's the
matte one is the ink liner and this is
my favorite it's been my favorite for a
while I really like it for winged liner
because it's more of a felt tip so so I
want to do my wing I'd get it nice and
sharp and it's one of my favorites it's
matte and it lasts all day and all night
it's amazing so just open two snaps in
my camera completely shut off and didn't
even save them so thanks camera okay

your dogs and how long have you had them

trainer and I feel like that's a whole
lot to go through and I have to get

camera and they don't want to have
pictures taken of them when they're
