back with some more eye masks because
I'm obsessed with these again they're
the Erno law slow multi mask or
multitask I serum ass I've just been
loving them so I have that I'm about to
take them off today we're doing
Instagram pics my makeup though what I
did if you guys don't follow me on
instagram you definitely should I post
more stories there I don't really
interact with snapchat much anymore more
about Instagram story but definitely go
follow me if you're not already but I
did Instagram stories and the polls on
all of these items and these are the
ones that you guys chose Davis helped me
as well so if you follow me you got to
see that it was a lot of fun I picked
all this stuff with my eyes closed and
then I had you guys pull on what you
wanted to see for this video so I have
everything and my busted bin right here
the only thing I forgot was eyeliner but
I'll just have to move forward I hope
you guys enjoyed this video if you want
to see all the makeup that you guys
picked and how they all work together
then definitely keep watching don't
forget to subscribe and hit that post
notification bell before you leave yeah
let's just go ahead and get started
all right so it's time to take these
beautiful masks off just feel so good
underneath my eyes I'm obsessed with
them though first off you guys know I do
eyes first so that's what we're gonna do
today
the eyeshadow palette that you guys
chose is the makeup revolution and the
sofex collaboration ultra eyeshadows and
there's 24 eyeshadows in here I was
really excited that I first off blindly
picked this but second off that you guys
wanted to see it because it was between
this one and they need Sephora electric
palette and I was like oh god they're
gonna want me to use that electric
palette I could just feel it in my bones
but I was wrong I am just gonna use this
Tarte double duty shape tape eyeshadow
primer this is something I'm still
trying out so I'll let you guys know
what I think later on I also did two
like wild card options so we went into
my new makeup for face and new makeup
for eyes and they randomly pick
something and then you guys voted on
what you wanted to see so another
product was this NARS eyeshadow palette
this is the night garden' one and it's
really pretty very dramatic and we will
see if I use this I'm not sure it's just
an optional product so I'm really
excited about this makeup revolution
palette though it is absolutely stunning
I actually did a vlog when I picked this
up I haven't been able to really dig
into it much so
we're gonna do that today I am going to
be taking some tape because I just don't
feel like being careful with my
eyeshadow today first thing we're gonna
take is this color right here and we're
going to set our lid with this so again
this is 24 eyeshadows it has a mixture
of matte and shimmers and yeah I haven't
really been able to play that much and I
haven't really seen people talk about it
much but the highlighter palette with
this collab is very very good they cloud
with a youtuber so I will leave her
channel down below I what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna take this really warm color
right here and we're gonna throw this
into the crease all the colors in this
palette look how pigmented all the
colors in this palette honestly are my
kind of shades whoo I love that color my
kind of shade
so we're really just splitting this all
into the crease and extending it out to
that tape to get a nice sharp line
blending out really well and I love this
color alright next rate I'm going to
take is this one right here obviously
and blend this into the crease ooh
so so so pretty yes please I'm so glad
you guys picked this because I really
thought y'all we're gonna vote for the
electric palette and then I saw
literally most of y'all voted for this
and I was like oh you all know me so
well
now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take
this pink shade right here and we're
gonna put this in the outer V we're also
going to bring it in towards the center
of the lid so I'm just gonna do it right
in here
very pretty color just like that nice
and pigmented I do want to take this
really light orange and fluff it right
in here just to make it pop
it's not too intense but it will just
kind of bring out some of that orange in
there then I'm gonna use a flat brush
which the one I always use is this mac
242 brush one of my favorite for this
I'm going to use I'm either gonna go
with this shade or this shade like look
at all of these colors look at all these
colors together maybe this one because
this is super pretty that's what I'll do
actually I'm gonna take a little bit of
my concealer you guys picked the Mac Pro
Longwear which I'll tell you what was
also in the category I'm going to take
the Mac Pro Longwear concealer and we'll
just carve this out you guys know I love
doing this take it right in here again
not going too far back just like a
little pop and then I'm going to take
this shade right here and put that on
the lid ooh this looks pigmented that is
super pretty I like that a lot
okay we'll do the same for the other eye
I'm just gonna take this little Milani
brush it is pretty fluffy but it's
really densely packed I'm going to take
this shade right here and I'm gonna
blend in between that pink and that
really pretty like kind of like goldish
color and we're just gonna work it right
in here just so we don't have any harsh
lines so pretty so there the eyes are
just kind of like a really blended out
pink orange warm colors with some pop in
the inner corner which I like and then
for lashes you guys chose these Lily
lashes and caramel these are one of my
favorites it was between this one and
the velour lashes so I'm going to go
ahead go off camera and put these on and
then I'll be back and we'll move on to
face so I'm back up my lashes on did
have to add this NYX matte liquid liner
because the way my eye shapes it up you
know it kind of goes in I gotta make it
look a little bit no more natural even
though these lashes aren't natural but
you know just the way they set up anyway
I got that on and now we're gonna move
on to face and I'm not oh man
everybody's this has a primer before I
have used this in a Instagram made me
buy it or something like trying it hyped
up Instagram makeup I don't know if it
got a lot of views and that was the
first time that I tried this product and
I haven't really used it much since that
video I'll be honest so you guys chose
this one over the cane and Austin
mattifying primer I see what you guys
did there you wanted me to use something
different it's the Pharsalia lakorn
essence skin enhancing antioxidant serum
so I don't know if this is technically a
primer but it's in my primer drawer and
we're gonna use that as a primer it's
actually super pretty just looks like
this and I'm gonna do the thing I had to
do it okay ah myself well I think about
this you guys go quick oh okay so I did
that and I'm just gonna go ahead and
blend it into the skin it's very
moisturizing it smells really good
smells really good
I don't know how foundation is gonna
work on top
to be honest I'm already oily as it is
so we will see we'll have to let this
really sink into the skin so wow this is
setting into the skin I could kind of
feel it absorbing now I'm going to be
using the Maybelline matte and poreless
foundation you guys pick this over the
NARS radiant foundation I believe is
what it's called you guys want to see
this one so I think this shade will
match me and it's self tan in quite a
while so this is in the shade 2 to 8
soft tan and again this is the mat in
poreless so it looks like I will be
using my Real Techniques sponge to blend
this out today yeah I think this color
will be good so we're just gonna take
our sponge yeah I think we're good kind
of has not a tacky feeling but it's
definitely set into the skin so you
could probably use a primer even if
you're like dry I haven't really seen a
lot of people use this anymore
so I'm gonna apply this all over the
skin guys I love this sponge so much
yeah this color is pretty dang good
thank the Lord
matches my neck perfectly this is more
of a medium to full coverage foundation
does cover out quite a bit have you guys
seen all the new and that foundations
coming out Revlon has one coming out
they don't have a ton of shades from
what I can tell at least in the picture
I saw on trend mood don't have a ton of
shades covergirl has one coming out it
looked like they had more shades in
Revlon and they're both mattifying
foundations which I am so excited to try
yeah have you guys seen it what do you
think I know Revlon's color range was
not good in the photo so that's never
good I start out a new foundation launch
but I don't know what their process is I
was a little nervous about this but it
looks good now you guys chose the Mac
Pro Longwear over the Dior full coverage
concealer don't remember how I feel
about the do or one so I kind of wanted
to see what that was like but I'm okay
with the Mac one too this is in NC 20 so
this is gonna be a little bit light for
me that's okay we'll just we'll make it
work you know
so we'll just apply under eyes we're
gonna highlight we're gonna
I in hopefully I don't mess up my outer
of these because every time I do
concealer I usually mess it up I have
been absolutely loving the k'kaw
concealer and brightening powder that I
showed and I think it was my last video
it's good like mixed with the Tarte
shape tape I love it it's good by itself
too but it's more medium coverage and
y'all know I like more of a full
coverage look I'm just a whole coverage
gal like the foundation was starting to
get a little bit darker it was starting
to oxidize so it's nice that this is a
little bit lighter because it's
highlighting the face but also kind of
taking that color down a bit mac
prolongwear still really good tart chick
take definitely still has more coverage
but Mac does look really good I like it
so for powder it was between Estee
Lauder the loose powder and then this
flower beauty powder this is the miracle
matte universal finishing powder
normally I don't set my face with a
powder that is white like this but you
guys wanted it so that's what we'll do
today I'm just gonna take my sponge and
apply this so I'm just gonna Pat it
underneath my eyes and we're gonna Pat
it on the rest of the face just because
this is my preferred way of putting
powder on
let's move on to bronzer so we have two
palettes that you guys chose because I
did have a flower Beauty blush bronzer
and highlighter and then I also had this
and then we had to pull audio bronzer
and Anasazi and you guys chose these two
so we're just gonna kind of go back and
forth I do really like this one from Too
Faced these are so pretty the highlights
are absolutely gorgeous and then this
bronzer in Rosewood from Anastacio is
really good too so we'll start with this
one first and I'm just going to lightly
put my brush in there and bronze up the
skin I definitely like this shade
rosewood more than my previous shade
which was had like my return palette
over here
my last shade I got was rich amber this
is definitely too dark for me but
rosewood if you're kind of my skin tone
this is like really really nice just use
it with a fluffy brush and a really
light hand so now we're going to just
lightly blend that out with a duo fiber
brush this is the MUA stippling brush
from CBS well not from oh yeah it's from
CBS but it's by the brand mu a my
favorite stippling brush now I'm gonna
go in with sunny honey from the Too
Faced palette and I'm gonna contour my
cheeks with this I still use this wet ma
brush have been really enjoying it so
I'm gonna take that color and just
contour the face smells really good
packaging is gorgeous I love it also so
if you guys follow me on my Instagram
you saw or on Twitter too you would have
seen that I tried out a new Starbucks
drink it was the refresher the
strawberry is the strawberry aside a
refresher
but with lemonade instead of water it's
really good you can also get a half
water half lemonade too and it's
absolutely delicious so I fell in love
with that and I was like huh I wonder
what it would be like if I had the
eliminate and my green tea cuz if you
follow me for a while you know all I
used to get from Starbucks was just like
a black coffee or the cold brew if I got
the cold brew I'd have almond milk if I
got black coffee like just regular iced
coffee I would get just black and then I
also get my green tea unsweetened with
no water well now I get it unsweetened
no water but with a splash of lemonade
and it just kind of tastes like you
squeezed fresh lemons in your green tea
so if you have a hard time drinking like
straight green tea with nothing in it
not even water they do water it down
then you need to try the splash of
lemonade because it is like changing
we're gonna move on now you guys pick
this NARS blush over the Lottie London
one that was in the picture this one's
really pretty it's in the shade luster
and I'm also gonna dip back into this
Too Faced natural face palette and dip
into pink sand and just do a little bit
of that as well
and then we're gonna blend it out now
for highlighter you guys chose this wet
and wild one over the Estee Lauder heat
way which I was really surprised about
but I think because you guys really
wanted to see this one in action so I
actually don't remember how I used to
feel about it so we're gonna check it
out today and we're just going to swirl
it woo
that is pretty mr.president use this
more that is gorgeous it's very similar
to heatwave to like when they were
side-by-side with each other they looked
super similar so maybe this could even
be a dupe for it
I think heatwave definitely has more
pigment but you can just build this up
okay so I am gonna dip back into this
one and I'm gonna take a little bit of
these too because they're so pretty
and just do a little bit more in the
center to really make it pop the
highlighters in this palette this
palette is just gorgeous in general and
the highlighters are really nice too
this satin sheets one is super super
gold it doesn't look like in the pan
really but it's definitely gold they're
very creamy and pigmented I like I love
everything in this palette it's just
really really good now we're gonna move
on to brows and you guys picked the
flower Beauty pen Oh
for the Ardell stroke a brow or strike a
brow oh I forgot I thought this was like
the pen pen like the feather pen but
this one's actually the like pencil
version we're gonna use this a I'm gonna
grab a spoolie because I do need a
spoolie normally I use two different
shades on my brows but we're just gonna
use this one today it's the shape blonde
we're just gonna fill them in might be
just a tad bit messy because this is a
pretty thick pencil let me show you guys
so you see how thick it is it's not like
a super skinny pencil so I have to go
back and forth with what side is more
slanted and try to really do like detail
work
I forgot eyeliner I can't believe it
okay so I am just gonna put a little bit
eyeliner i'm gonna use this Marc Jacobs
one in brownie just a brown eyeliner I'm
just gonna use this on my lower
waterline these are great by the way
they're the matte gel eye crayons
they're very pigmented I feel like I
tried them before and I wasn't a big fan
but I've been trying them again recently
and I'm really enjoying them this color
as well as a earthquake those have been
like my two favorites I'm actually going
to take this deep brown real quick I'm
gonna press this right up against that
lower lash line this is more of the warm
toned Brown in the palette this actually
goes really well with the eyeliner okay
and then we're gonna take our pencil
brush and I'm gonna go in with this pink
shade actually I'll mix the pink and the
orange and then put that down to blend
it out so I'm gonna blend out the edges
of that Brown ooh and mixing them kit
gives like a cool effect then what I'm
gonna do is clean my pencil brush and
we're gonna go in with a lighter shade
to highlight the brow as well as the
inner corner I'm gonna use this shade
right here in my inner corner nice pop
and then underneath the brow
so I did highlight underneath my brow in
the inner corner with that color and
that is so pretty I really like the way
the eyes look I think you could not tell
this is a drugstore palette like it is
so pretty I just I love all of it these
are my kind of colors too you guys
already know obsessed with it okay then
we have two more things you guys picked
the l'oreal infallible Pro matte liquid
lipstick in the shade down I was very
rude of my camera so this one's in the
shade shakedown the colors that I picked
randomly were almost identical they were
insane so I liked that you guys picked
this one but the SI Lauder liquid lips -
are really good if you're wanting to
test them out but like I said I'm gonna
use this shade shake down oh that's a
lot darker than what I thought was gonna
be does it go with the I look
necessarily but you know we're gonna
make it work so dark we're gonna go in
with the Mac Pro Longwear concealer and
we're gonna lighten this up so you can
create kind of a ombre look this is more
cool tone the look is more warm tone so
that's the lip color on again it doesn't
really go with a look like super well
but I think lining it up a little bit in
the center is like he kind of helped out
a little bit and then the last thing you
guys chose was the Mac prep and prime
fixed and gold light it's the fixed plus
that has like gold shimmers in it and I
normally don't use things like this I
feel like they make my skin look bad you
can kind of see that's what it looks
like before you shake it then after you
shake it it's this gorgeous Ness here I
tried something like this one two-faced
came out with the unicorn collection and
they had something like this in there
anyway my skin look terrible so we've
seen how this looks so although they're
coming out with a matte one too so I'm
pretty excited about that but these
usually make me look bad so delicious
smells good I don't really notice a big
difference like insane glitter in my
skin or anything I just don't like using
this on my face that much there's
definitely a difference between primer
water applying it before your makeup and
then something that I spray after makeup
on a Y but for me it just seems to like
bring out texture on me I don't know
this is a makeup look that I came up
with for this video this is the makeup
that you guys picked out so I really
like it - the lip color being off
I like the lip color just not with this
look but I like everything else I think
it looks really really nice okay guys so
that is it my hair is done still in
Sam's t-shirt but at least my hairs
don't forget to follow me on Instagram
