clothing wow so you know I'm like are
these lights too bright
oh cool
another thing hey guys so today's video
is going to be a spring clothing haul
this is definitely a collective clothing
haul and all the stuff is from more
affordable sites so I really hope you
enjoy it and let's get started the first
thing I want to talk about are these
sunglasses that I got from HauteLook
first off this packaging or this like
little case is so cute I love this it's
Kate Spade and I actually got these off
of HauteLook there were like 25 bucks I
had a head on what do you call them add
credits so I got these for free but look
at how cute they are
this is like my style right here like
the semi cat eye big lens these are my
kind of synthesis okay so the first
place I want to show you guys is forever
tween woman I went a little ham and
forever from us so i'ma show you guys
everything I got this one is filled with
shoes and one of the pairs of shoes that
I got were like sandal they look like
the Birkenstock ones they're kind of
knockoffs but a little black and white
dog rose she you know she chewed them up
so they're gone but luckily I have two
will show you so the first pair I've
actually worn these and they're really
cute and really comfortable I don't have
any pair of sandals this kind of brown
so I got these from forever 21 I really
like them they're easy to just slip on
and go and yeah I just thought they were
I just thought they were really cute and
then another pair of signals that I got
from them were these I wanted these
originally in black but they didn't have
my size I'm a true eight but I had to go
up to eight and a half in these but I
love them they have like the little
fringe I in the fringe baby like that's
that's my calling in life is to be a
fringe baby and I loved the fringe on
this I loved the detail of like the
ankle wrap so these look a lot cuter on
but I really really like
and again I loved the brown color of
these and then I got these shoes which
are like little sneakers I don't have
anything like this but I really wanted
something casual like this just for like
day to day use or something and these
are only 10 bucks and they're like a
silver sneaker I thought they were
really really cute I mean it's not like
BAM in your face silver but it's just
like a cute way to kind of like spice up
an outfit or something
and then this next pair I got in two
different colors just because I love
them so much
and these I really have nothing alike
they were 15 and 90 each so they're like
what like what would you say it with
these be like little loafers or
something I don't know I got them in
this really pretty brown obviously I got
some Brown sandals cuz I just feel like
you could ever have enough Brown sandals
and every time I tried to like match
brown sandals and brown belts they never
matched so I feel like I have to have
every shade of brown to match about like
does anybody else like that anyways and
then I got these in white as well just
because I really liked the white or the
cream
moving on to clothes so the first talk I
got I love this actually got this in a
large because my boobs have gotten
bigger I don't know why but it's really
annoying me it's like can it all just go
to the butt but my boobs have gotten
bigger and like when I wear button ups
and stuff I usually wear a medium but
sometimes a medium just isn't enough and
like I'll have a space you know if you
have a bigger chest you know when you
wear a the button ups sometimes if it's
too tight it like leaves like a hole I
don't like that I think that's very
unattractive so I always go up the size
so I got this in size large and it fits
really nice around the bus it's not too
tight and I plan on wearing this like
tied up at the waist and I loved the
color combo of this this was just some
jeans shorts tying at the waist and you
got a little southern belle on your
hands okay and then I got this shirt
because I love this color I think it's
so cute especially with some
high-waisted shorts and some antique
color jewelry so I just got like a
little crop top like this the one that
I'm wearing right now I also got in this
haul but I needed to wear it now then I
got another color like this
don't know if I'm gonna wear this one
just because I don't know if I like this
color with my new blonde hair I like
these kind of colors more on brunettes
but we'll see we'll see how it works out
and then it also got this little
crocheted tank top because I really like
crochet tanks as well just with like a
colorful bralette or something and this
one does have little tassels at the end
also on this trip I did get quite a bit
of shorts just because my buds got
bigger my boobs and with Mettenberger I
could have it any way I wish my boobs
would have went straight to my butt too
but anyways I had to get more jeans
because they fit around the waist but
they don't fit my butt so it's just been
a difficult situation so I got some
shorts at forever 21 these are a
high-waisted black shorts and these were
only at 1090 I really like getting
Shores from forever 21 because there are
nice and affordable and they're still on
trend
these ones fits like so perfectly
these were 1790 and they're just
acid-washed shorts shorts so love those
and then I got another pair and a dark
wash this one was 1090 I got another
pair this one came with a belt so I
scored on that one and this one was 1980
a little bit more expensive it was
probably the belt hahaha but they're
cuffed at the ends and these are just
really cute casual shorts I really like
the back of these two and they're low it
more high-waisted so I love that I got
another pair of the black shorts because
I don't have enough black shorts in my
life so these are again just another
pair of the high-waisted black ones and
then I got these a little cute sexy
cutoff destroyed denim ones which are
adorable what they would look really
cute with a flannel and then I got this
plain old top because I thought this
would be super cute with like a white
bralette and you could unzip this a
little bit to make it a little bit more
sexy and casual but like the arms of
this are a little bit bag here so you
would see a little bit of the bralette
peeking through I also had these from
forever 21 they're like terry cloth
shorts and love the different patterns
and textures going on with these shorts
I actually wore these when I drove down
to Valdosta and they were
Oh comfortable so comfortable I really
like these I'm going I mention this
before I'm going to another country
festival concert thing in May and I'm
probably gonna wear these on the way
down there because I mean it's really
not that far for me but I like to be
comfortable okay so the next shop is
white pops motif I mentioned them
honestly every single time I do a
clothing a lot because they have such
cute stuff so the first thing actually
posted these on my Instagram all back
when I got them so when I put these on
every time I just all I want to do is be
like in my car and just be like bad boys
bad boys
I love aviators like this that are
oversized and kind of droopy because it
just kind of fit my face better and the
smaller aviators just show how big my
head is so I really like these and these
are the quite light shade line also from
my folks I got this statement necklace
which I adore I love statement necklaces
and this is really cute this would even
look cute with a burgundy shirt that I
got from forever 21 these shorts are a
little too big for me they're in a
medium but they're really cute I just
I'm not gonna be able to wear them um
but they look like this and we have to
send them back and they're just really
destroyed I mean these are really cute
high-waisted jeans they just don't fit
me right sure I post it on a histogram
as well I really love it it's so cute I
mean showing it to you just doesn't do
it justice like you have to see it on
but it's like a cold shoulder top and it
has a tie friend and also ties at the
bottom which I love so it's like a flowy
top but it still cinches in at the waist
so you can see where your waist is and
it's not like too flowy and not put
together if you know what I mean so yeah
it's just like the perfect summer top
because it's such a lightweight material
and I loved it I wore this when I was in
California and it's just beautiful I
also got this crop top which is like
super crop top this is a size 8 if you
have a bigger chest like I do I would
recommend going up a size if you don't
like that super tight feeling I'm like
are you 6d I actually think I'm going to
like a 38d right now cuz my boobs are
just getting so big and no I'm not
pregnant by the way
I'm on my PMSing right now so that is
not an option
but if you do have a bigger chest go up
size but this is really cute it's just
like literally a boob cover-up on me
because my boobs are just just just so
tight but it's a really cute crop it
looks like this and it ties in the front
which I love things like this this is
one of my favorite shirts I got through
my thoughts I mean it's just beautiful
and I posted a picture of this on
Instagram to you as you're you tell have
had some of this stuff for a while but
it is just a crochet white top I love
this it is so cute and it's like the
perfect crop top size and this is a size
8 and this fits really good on me so
this last place is Windsor and holy
cannoli they have like some of the
cutest stuff first thing that jewelry
wise is this necklace from Windsor and
I'm obsessed with it it's just jingling
it everywhere but it's kind of like this
antique necklace so this is what it
looks like I actually plan on pairing
this with a tank top that I got from
Windsor as well so when I go to this
country concert I pretty much have my
outfit now because a winter just has
like really some of the cutest items
ever another accessory I got I was
actually gonna buy a pair of I really
love prada sunglasses I have a lot of
them well not a lot of them but I have a
few pairs I like to invest in my Prada
sunglasses because I know that they'll
last a really long time and the style
for me just never goes out like I just I
really love them so I was gonna buy a
pair of tortoise ones or like brown pair
and instead I found ones that look the
exact same on Wednesday that I was gonna
purchase same look just as cute like I
just needed a pair of tortoise or Browns
my glasses to go with outfits that
weren't black Soho I really like these I
think they're really really cute and
they fit my face really well and then I
also got another necklace sorry I need
to fill out this is like a body chain
necklace type thing it's really
interesting but it's very very cute so
basically what it does is this goes
around your neck and then these go
around like your arms so they just kind
of drink out but it's really cute and I
like this a lot it's very very
interesting and I love the silver I'm
really diggin like the silver gunmetal
kind of jewelry right now I think
they're very adorable so this top I'm
obsessed with and I was gonna wear this
one to the concert but I've decided to
wear a different one that I got from
Windsor but I'm obsessed with this top
it is so cute especially with my blonde
hair now so this is what it looks like
it's a what do you call this this is a
halter top and it has like an eagle
little tribal looking thing on it but I
love this and the back is so cute - it
just has like this little thing going
down which I love so then it holds up
the back as well as the front yeah I
think it's really pretty I love this
color it's so cute and it's a really
really soft material I also got this
little tunic which is really cute great
to wear like day to day just put some
little black like spandex shorts or even
jean shorts it's I think it's too short
or as a dress personally but it's just a
little tunic like this and it's tie-dye
and I just I loved it it's really cute
bouncy soft this with a bralette would
just be adorable I love this crochet top
I have one like this in blue and I
really wanted it one in black so I got
this one it's really pretty
again it has like the little tassel
fringe at the bottom this one I tweeted
about and I was like oh my god I have to
have that shirt because I just find it
so funny so in the front it just looks
like a plain old you know muscle to you
but in the back it says stop following
me I mean see like come on that's
freaking hilarious like stop following
me people that come up with this stuff
need to be my friends because I find
that so hilarious when you get a pair of
wool spandex shorts to go under the
tunic
these look like toddler shorts
how's it go fit Alma but it actually
barely affects my butt but it's there
and this is a no size thing so if your
butt is bigger than mine
and if you want to see how big my butt
is go check out my morning routine
because you can see it there if your
butt's bigger than mine it's probably
not gonna fit in these because mine
barely fits in this then I got this
dress which I love I love I love I love
it's like a tie-dye black dress I think
this is so stinkin cute it's really
really pretty and I love the colors of
it so it's just a little cami one and it
goes all the way down is just a maxi
dress but I love the ombre effect of it
I think it's really pretty oh I also got
this because I love saying this little
saying a fusion I just think it's funny
usually I'm joking around when I say it
but it just says or nah my BAE or not I
just thought it was cute something easy
to throw on and yeah oh okay and this is
a shirt that I actually plan on wearing
to shakey boots the concert it's just so
cute with high-waisted shorts and then
this necklace paired with it is just
it's everything so this is a little tank
that I got I love it so much it's like a
high-neck and it is more of a muscle t
sleeve I'm obsessed with the color combo
and again with that necklace it's gonna
be adorable so follow me on instagram if
you want to see me wear this to see how
I style it because this is like one of
my favorite shirts that I got I love it
okay and then the last two things I got
from Windsor were shoes so since I
didn't get the ones ever of 21 at my
size Windsor also had a pair of really
cute French sandals and I actually kind
of liked these better but again they're
just like little fringe black sandals
they zip in the back and I love them I
mean I'm telling you if there's
something friends I'm going to buy it
because I'm a Flynn I'm a fringe child
instead of a flower child I'm a fringe
child that's what I am and then the last
pair of shoes that I got were these
hello we're these little white gladiator
sandals I don't have anything like this
and these have a really good padding to
them I was very shocked and they're $25
they laced up they zip in the back - so
it's like easy access but I really
really love these and again like I said
I don't have anything like this and I
needed a pair of light sandals because I
don't have any so these are awesome I'm
so excited to wear them so that is it
for this fashion haul I really hope you
