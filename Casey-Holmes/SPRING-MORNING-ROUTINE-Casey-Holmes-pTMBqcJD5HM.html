I hope you enjoy this video it is my
morning routine so I do every single
weekday morning so I hope you enjoy it
first off I have my own little arm clock
her name is rose and she scratches my
arm and comes and greets me every single
morning she is the sweetest dog and she
calls me to death so I love her very
much and then Daisy comes up on the bed
gives me kisses and Lily just chills
until I say it's time to potty so as
every other person does in the morning I
check all of my social media and just
kind of waste time on my phone and
sometimes I'll even play games I don't
know how I get here but I just start
playing them so one of my favorite games
right now is best fiends
you can see it knows I'm back because I
come here too often so I like this game
it's really easy to play basically you
just want to connect all the same icons
and they end up going and knocking out
that little monster which you want to
knock him out so you want to connect
them as fast as possible and as many of
them as possible I'll leave a link for
you guys down below where you can
download it for free
and on Mother's Day May 8th they are
also going to do a free special gift
so definitely play the game on that day
to get your free gift and then I just
text Davis back because you text every
morning and then it is time for me to
finally get my low self out of bed
so finally we all go downstairs and I
get my slides on I love these from Nike
I mean they're just like the best shoes
ever but I have to let the dogs out and
also clean my pool I do this every
morning just to get any debris that's
probably fallen into the pool and make
sure to get it out the dogs kind of run
around and they absolutely love the
porch so just kind of chill here for a
little bit until I'm done and we're
ready to go back inside for some
breakfast
under the clouds real bow so
and then it's on to make my favorite
thing in the morning which is coffee I
had to go get some more cake ups but my
favorite one is the caramel Starbucks
blend it is so good especially with
Vanilla creamer it's just amazing then
it's time to walk over and take my
AdvoCare and I have to watch out for
dogs cuz they lay everywhere so I just
put my coffee down and I put my creamer
in I do use quite a bit of creamer but
honestly I don't really mind it because
in the morning and then I get my
advocate ready if you've been watching
my when I eat in the day videos you've
seen this but if not I'll leave what I
use down below just so you guys know but
I do this every single morning and also
every night and I didn't have time to
cook this morning so I'm just going to
eat a protein bar and drink my coffee
and also look at YouTube and work on my
video
now it's time to take a shower and get
ready for the gym I don't do anything
crazy in the shower I basically just
wash off my body shave and wash my face
and then I go over to the section where
I have all my workout clothes and I just
pick out whatever I want for the day
Lily actually helped me so thanks to her
I had some good looking pants on and a
nice little shirt
so today with shoulders it was a nice
workout a good burn and I had a really
good morning this is how I start every
morning and I just end up at the gym I
love it and you guys will have a full
workout video very soon I'll show you
guys all of my legs arms everything like
that
so thumbs up if you're excited for those
videos and thank you guys so much for
watching I hope you enjoyed this and I
will see you all in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
