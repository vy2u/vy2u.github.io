and see hey guys today's videos gonna be
all about my self tanning regimen these
are things I've been doing quite a bit
past few months and I thought I'd
finally share it with you guys I've had
so many questions on how I stink tan and
I figured why not go ahead and do it
especially for the summertime if you
don't want to go lay out or anything
like that these are great alternatives
so the first thing I'm going to talk
about is my favorite way to self tan and
I have my own spray tanning system now
and it is for a million dollar tan I've
had this for I say a month a month and a
half and I've been in love with it it is
so freakin amazing I just got sprayed
Colten spread me last night and I feel
so dark and it just it looks so good it
doesn't give you an orange tan it just
gives you like that natural bronze color
to your skin it was great about this
system is you can decide on your color
you can decide if you want light medium
dark because the solution is so dark you
can see it when it goes on your skin so
you already kind of know what color
you're gonna be basically after the
spray tan now this rating system that
you get from a million dollar tan comes
with literally everything you need it
comes with baby wipes gloves hair nets
body scrubs extra sprays you know if you
just want to touch up or something comes
with barrier cream it literally comes
with everything now for the baby wipes I
really highly recommend them I haven't
been using baby wipes everytime cold
spray Tammy but last night for some odd
reason I didn't accuse the baby wipes so
my hands are kind of crazy because a lot
of you know my hands are very dry so
whenever self-tanner gets on them they
freaking just hate it they hate it grab
use it last nice and my hands look crazy
I don't know how I forgot but somehow I
did once you use the baby wise because I
put very good cream on my hands and my
feet and I usually just go ahead and
wipe it off at the end of the session
and I just totally forgot but make sure
you wipe your hands after you get your
spray but I really like the system
honestly my tan lasts for a week Colton
will spray me about every Friday just so
I can have it really nice on the Lee
and I'll still be really tan throughout
the week so it lasts me a week as long
as you say moisturize basically with any
self-tanner you use as long as you stay
nice and moisturize the longer your self
tan will last so keep that in mind as
well and also I'm going to show you guys
a clip of Colton spray tanning my legs
and also I know a bunch of you when you
go and look at the price you're gonna be
like oh my god that is so expensive I
mean I went to my tanning salon I was
getting the versus saw and I paid $35 a
month plus $10 every time I went in and
I went in every Friday and the vs. ball
tan I got it in dark and it didn't last
as long as I wish it would've it
literally lasts until about Monday and
then just started fading and I didn't
even obtain anymore so it was kind of
pointless and a waste of money
and if you want the unlimited package
and my tanning salon it's like 85 to 95
dollars I can remember exactly how much
it is but it's pretty expensive and my
salon is actually a lot cheaper than the
ones that I've heard of I'm sorry there
is no way I would pay $100 a month for
unlimited spray tanning but with this
system is very much like one of those
one-time things you spend the money on
at one time and you're done man I think
it's a great idea if you want to kind of
have like a party with all your friends
you can always go half in with your mom
your sister your best friend on the
price and it's just a one-time price I
know it's really expensive but it's a
nice system and it comes with everything
you need so I really recommend it it's
personally my favorite way of
self-tanning I don't even use
self-tanning lotion anymore but I do
have one that I want to tell you guys
about because I've been talking about
forever and I still really love it but
ever since I got the system I've just
been strictly spray tan I don't put that
link down below and so you can check it
out I also have a 20% off coupon it's
not for the system but it's for the
other products that million dollar tan
has so you can check the down below if
you are interested so the last filter I
think we want to talk about is this Sun
Goddess sunless tanning lotion this is a
lotion a self-tanner
this is what it looks like if you've
been watching my channel for a while you
know that I have been using this since I
think it's June of last year
yeah but using it since June of last
year it is literally one of the best
lotion sub-camp I have my favorite spray
tan one which I use all the time now so
I don't really go to this a lot unless I
don't have time throughout the week to
actually stop and spray tan then I'll
use this this is a new bottle because if
you saw my products I used up I did use
up one last month but it's a really
really really dark lotion it's great it
has like a green base to it so it gives
you a nice olive tan and you want
something with a dark face just like the
spray tan because you can see where it's
going on and you know if you missed a
spot or anything like that you always
want a self-tanner with a dark base and
what's great about this is it comes with
gloves and everything and I do think
they come when they ship this off it
comes with a pack of ten samples and
it's really nice I think it's like 40
bucks I'll put a coupon code for 10% off
down below if you're interested and also
sometimes does have this thing where you
can order samples before you buy so you
can also go to their website check out
the samples buy if you like it and then
be done so it's really easy but I've
talked about this so much I mean I
really can't say enough good things
about this self tanner lotion it really
quickly why we're on the topic of self
tanning lotions I want to put this in
here it's the million dollar tan cabana
tan face extreme this is strictly for
your face which is what I like like I
will not put some guys on my face
because I have very sensitive skin and
I'm so scared that that's gonna break me
out so this is what it looks like I
showed this in my March favorites I do
believe and it's nice and easy whenever
you feel like your face is getting a
little bit too pale you could just apply
this I probably do it every two days
just makes my face nice and tan so I
don't have this white white face and a
really tan body because I used to do
that all the time but now I'm like well
I like going out without makeup on so
that's great because it I can go out
with that makeup on and I have a crazy
looking
Thanks so that is pretty much it guys
those are the two self-tanning products
I have been loving and I cannot get
enough of I'm just a spray tan aha like
right now I mean I just I can't get
enough of it
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video

self-tanning products aren't down below

self-tanning world so thank you guys so
