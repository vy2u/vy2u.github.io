looking really bronzed because I just
felt tan before this video so I wanted
to bring you guys a like spring/summer
clothing haul I have just a few things
you know this is going to be like a
ginormous haul but these items really
stand out to me and I wanted to share
them with you now actually guys while
back on Twitter if you wanted a clothing
haul and a lot of you said yes so I
figured I would do that for you guys
today you have so many things to share
with you I hope you're excited what I'm
wearing is one of the pieces that I got
and I just love it this will also be a
try on haul so I definitely stay tuned
if you like clothing hauls they want me
to do some more and you like these
pieces definitely give it a thumbs up so
I know to continue to do them because I
know it's a little bit different than
any of them makeup videos I have on my
channel so definitely give it a thumbs
up don't forget to subscribe and if you
want to see some really cute pieces like
this whoops then let's just go ahead and
get started
okay so since I've been talking about
this top I'm just going to mention it
first this is from the brand lizard
thicket or from the boutique lizard
tikka I believe I'm saying that right I
always say it wrong this is what looks
like it's just like a velvet top and it
has this lace detail here on the chest
and on the bottom so yes myself hands
developing so don't judge me too much
and then on the sides it's a little bit
cut open so that's what looks like oh
I'm going to show you is my favorite
star scroll but yeah this is my my
favorites I believe I got one of the
last one because I always felt their
sight to see if they have some new
things and I want to quickly mention my
favorite strapless bra that I've been
wearing a lot to you guys because I
showed this on my vlog Channel and had a
lot of you asked me to update you so
here's your update I love this one bra
so this is the new bra ultra like a
softer lighter definition of freedom I
get mine in the size double D for this
because I find that these are in a
little bit small on the cup size but the
double D does fit like my full cup it
doesn't look awkward or anything I love
this it's the last thing so well I've
worn it so many times and it's still
really sticky very comfortable and it
looks good under top so like I said I do
have it underneath this one and you
can't really tell but it is padded you
could push it more together and make
your boobs like have a lot of volume
right in here and a lot more cleavage
but honestly I have period boobs right
now and they hurt really bad so I messed
up in it you could do that and I just
really liked it I always keep it in the
box it has like a plastic box that it
comes with which is on my bed right now
and I just keep it in here and I've been
using it non-stop I'm just going to nope
and kind of like a different order I'm
just going to grab things because I have
it all hanging over here so I'm just
going to grab some things and show it to
you so the next shop is called Nana max
now they do a lot of facebook lives
which is what I like to watch I find
them so entertaining like if anyone does
the Facebook live I'm watching them I
know some people hate them but like I
understand why because it's like I'm
watching a TV show so I always tune in
to their Facebook lives and see what
they have and this shirt without stock
when it first went live but then I was
there when it went back in stock like I
have one on their site randomly after a
live feed and I saw it and I was like
yeah this is the top it is just so
gorgeous the floral print on this is
just beautiful very very soft I mean the
thing about some of these we teach by
physical is they're thick at one they
have such soft fabric where vendors are
just really nice whoever these people
buy from because their fabrics are
always so soft and it's pretty sick as
well so it's not going to be see-through
but it's off the shoulder and then you
have these sleeves right here which are
gorgeous it can be a really great casual
top or you could really dress this up I
love the floral print it's a really
great links as well and then you do have
this keyhole opening in the back and I
just love the high neck the off the
shoulder everything about this top I
think is just stunning this next item is
one that I'm probably going to wear to a
wedding I don't know quite yet I'm just
trying to find like the perfect dress
but I still love this dress I think it's
beautiful when I saw this ring on the
live feed I felt like you go like a
plastic ring so I didn't know if I was
going to love it but I ended up loving
this because it's more like a metal and
it looks really great in person but your
head just goes here and then this goes
over your chest and then again is
another off the shoulder dress and I
just love this it is fully lined so
you're not going to do a peep show or
anything and I love the little ruffle
here at the top and also in feedback I
just really like this I think it's so
pretty your armpits are open so you're
not going to get any like sweat stains
these so to me I really like this I
can't wait for you guys to see what it
looks like on I just think it is so
gorgeous so the next items are from
princess Polly they have really great
items as well they kind of just buy from
different people and put it all on their
site it's kind of like a revolve or
something like that you know where they
have really great brands all in one
place so
the first thing that I got that I'm so
excited to wear this summer which I've
showed you guys this on instagrams but
these are the new desi key sunglasses
she has some black faded ones coming out
that are killer but I love these for
summer I just think they're gorgeous
they're a nice ombre orange to yellow
tint and I don't know I just think these
are so cool so we just love them maybe
not with a smokey eye but I think they
are just so awesome they really can just
amp up any outfit and I don't know I
think they look awesome feel like I'm
with the times you know I feel kind of
trendy another thing that I got from
princess Polly is one of my favorite
styles this year and it's wrapped tops
so this is what this shirt looks like
it's just a nice burgundy striped top
these sleeves are kind of flowy and
really loose so you have the ability to
wrap this shirt around and tie it which
I love you can pair a really great bra
let meet this I think this shirt with
some white denim shorts is just perfect
for summer and it just feels really good
soft and all of that and this is by the
brand in the cuff so that's it so if you
go on their site you should be able to
find this by the way they did provide me
a coupon code for you guys for 20% off
so if you're interested in anything I
will leave that down below the next item
is a dress that I did not know if I was
going to like it because of the pattern
the pattern is a little bit more boho
for me I'm not really boho but something
about this once I tried it on I loved it
I just think for the summertime with
some white sandals or white wedges and
like a white purse this is just really
gorgeous so it's this dress right here
and that's the pattern see what I mean
when I mean like boho this is very boho
we love this button detail down the
front it has a deep v in the front and a
deep V in the back and it's just a
really nice dress it's like that perfect
length I think with the blonde hair and
the tan I just I feel this I feel this
this please are nice and loose or not
too tight on your arms I feel like what
makes this so flirty and kind of sexy is
just that deep V in the front and the
back I just really really love that I
believe this is the last thing a from
princess Polly this is an off the
shoulder dress and it is in this olive
green shade has it embroidered a floral
detail here on the sleeve and what I
love about this you can wear as a dress
it's a little bit of a shorter dress so
it just depends on what you like you can
wear it as a top but it is off the
shoulder so you have the ability to
figure out what kind of length you like
this but it is really like
white and great for summer and I just
love these like open bell sleeves I
think it is absolutely adorable next up
I have two tops from Free People
actually got this tank and another color
as well as like more red by figures you
guys would really like this color and
this is what it looks like I've had some
tanks like this from Free People before
so I knew I would like the style it's
where it just ties right here on the
side which is a little bow but I love
this print and it's so beautiful again
with that floral I love the blue the
pink it's really feminine and I love all
the different patterns and everything
and this is one of my favorite things
that I got from Free People first off
it's white I love white and it's a set
so you have this top right here that is
just gorgeous I mean if you're going to
the beach this is a perfect Beach outfit
but have all these cutouts here in the
front in the chest area which is
adorable again you can wear like a
really nice bra let or a strapless bra
and then in the back it does have like
this cage detail and then you have the
matching shorts that are stretchy and
this is should the gorgeous print I love
it it's really open and flowy too great
for summer if you're like me and you
sweat a lot you're going to like this
because it's just so loose and like all
that sweat is going to dry off and might
not get all of your clothes I have a few
more things from that lizard ticket
boutique and the first thing is this is
another trend that I'm really loving
right now and I had it mainly just in
basics actually have a shirt like this
from Alexander Wang that was a lot more
offensive than this one so let's be on
the lookout for people with cheaper
alternatives this is just that knotted
front T that everyone's loving right now
it's just like a cropped tee in the back
it does have this cinched waist I guess
you could call it but I love this it's
just a great basic and again it's that
white classic top and it does have a
pocket actually have this dress in the
green and I loved it so much that I got
it in black but I don't know if they
call this black online this is
definitely more grey but this is what it
looks like and I love this it's just a
nice flowy soft dress and I wore a
strapless bra with this as well for my
engagement photos I did wear the green
one in the engagement photo is not this
what I figured I would pick this one up
just cuz I love it so much I love that
high neck right here but in the open
detail in the front and in the back very
flattering these are like flutter
sleeves I would say and they just really
flatter your shoulders and arms really
beautifully it just lays so nice
is another one of my all-time favorite
tops that I got from them and it just
looks like this in the front you know
this top right here is definitely
business in the front party in the back
I love this top again you can wear a
sticky bra with it it does have openings
on the side as well I think this is a
classic gorgeous summer top I love it I
love it it's a high neck I love the open
details it's not too scandalous but it's
perfect for those really hot summer days
so I love it in with a Chan it just
going to be so gorgeous
I got another basic white top this is
just something that I wanted to have in
my closet just for a basic I just have
this really nice kind of I guess cage
detail the fabric is very very soft
again and it's just one of those basics
you can't go wrong with you can pair it
with absolutely anything this one's so
cute I just pictured this with black
shorts and I don't know what shoes yet
but I love the color of this so here's
the collar you have like some studded
details right here and then you have
this open neck which I think you guys
can tell that I'm really loving this
open neck thing and then it just says
rock music American I just think the
graphic tee with this detail is so cute
and I love the color the color is what
really sold me and then the last thing I
got is a kind of flirty girl shirt and
again it has been a cutout I'm over the
like crisscross details like you know
the lace-up tops now I'm into these so
this is what it looks like it has this
beautiful lace detail a cold shoulder
top but still has the lace here on the
bottom so what I would probably do with
this is like tuck in the nips and denim
here at the top or maybe tight and a
knot and really focus on this chest area
because that's my favorite part of the
shirt it has two more tops to share with
you this one is from All Saints so it's
a little bit more on the pricey side but
I showed this on my Instagram figured I
would share it with you guys because I
love it so much it's so different so
it's this really nice kind of muted pink
but when you go down it has this cinched
up area that I think it's so cool very
different I love it is a basic top but
they added this little fun flare to it
and it just really ants at the top I
mean you can wear a dressy wear casual
this laptop is from Nordstrom and some
of you are going to think this is the
ugliest top ever but I love the colors
and I love the print and you're going to
see why so again this is from Nordstrom
it's from Paul and Joe's sister and
it's this really gorgeous blue like the
camera isn't even picking up how blue
this is a really gorgeous blue with
Dalmatians all over it and I love the
contrast of like the white the black the
blue it is just so fun and so gorgeous
no this is a lot for some people but you
could wear this with some white shorts
and this is like your statement piece
and it just looks really fun and great
for summer because it has so many great
colors in it mainly just blue
but like the white and black really pop
with it right guys that is it for this
haul let me know what you thought down
below in the comments and I hope you
enjoyed this again if you do like the
clothing hauls give it a thumbs up
because I haven't done them in so long
so I'm kind of like testing the waters
to see if you guys really like them
thank you guys again so much for
watching and I will see you all in my
next video hi
