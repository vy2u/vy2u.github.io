got style it after I do this makeup I
didn't want to style at first because if
I can find a ssin in my hair then I
gotta work it out
basically this is what the bottle looks
like is a lot of slimmer than the older
packaging it's a lot more sleek and you
can see like the color I guess I don't
know if this is my shade this is in the
shade medium I did take the plastic off
and you just have your little spray
nozzle and it looks like it's going to
be a good little nozzle but it says it's
non oily what is this Lissy quick and
easy professional airbrush results at
home in stippling pigment technology
helps color blend seamlessly creating a
smooth and even and flawless matte satin
finish you know I'm going to be looking
for that tear our wear waterproof
fragrance free so that's good for you
guys who have really really soon as your
skin let's see so we were just going to
go with it I'm nervous it's like you
know you're spraying yourself in the
face it's kind of scary I shake it now
let's get going
I don't see anything maybe it's like a
light mist
okay I see stuff coming onto my skin I
guess can you can you tell a difference
I see it in my hair so very very fine
mist quit baby let's see
let's go forehead
Oh God that last one was a real winner
winner let me rub this out I was like I
have no eyebrows you want to tint your
eyebrows in a hairbrush or get a spray
foundation and that'll happen it looks
like it matches though I don't really
want to spray it even more let me show
you guys so this is what looks like up
close
I mean it looks like it has a nice
natural finish other than getting all my
eyebrows and my eyelashes I kind of have
a prom concealer and see how it goes
from here I think I'm going to stick
with it like this I think it looks good
so far though it does have like a matte
finish so I enjoyed that so yeah I'm
just going to do the rest of my face
makeup and see how it looks the medium
does kind of match really well I'm
liking it so far so I'm going to go
ahead and progress my face makeup and
I'll be right back I know I just put it
on I was like oh I like it but I don't
think I like it anymore after it's set
into the skin I feel like you could
definitely tell I have foundation on and
it's just I don't know I don't like it
any more I kind of want to take it off
but I think it's something with the
spray foundations because honestly like
after I use a Dior
I loved it for the longest time and then
lately when I've been trying to go back
to it I just don't love it as much like
I feel like it's tinged into my pores
and it just is not flattering on my skin
anymore this one I feel like it sinks
into the pores a little bit at first it
didn't wants to set into the skin I feel
like it definitely went straight into my
pores it was very hard to blend my blush
and bronzer I don't know it was just
difficult like I just used my regular
blush and bronzers and my regular
brushes that I always used and it was
just a lot more difficult to get looks
to get it to look more seamless and I
don't like that so this is definitely
assuming that foundation but I can feel
my oils underneath this foundation like
I feel like I'm going to get oily
throughout the day and that's why I also
want to wash off this makeup because I
can feel the oils like sitting
underneath the makeup but I'm going to
go ahead and go through
day and see if anything changes see the
kind of you know I don't know think it's
better so it is 12:03 and I'll update
you guys in just a little bit on how the
foundation is holding up hi guys so I
literally just walked in from running
errands and I thought I would do an
update for you guys because I think this
is going to be the time where I'm taking
off this foundation because I'm so over
wearing it it is now 331 and this
foundation has it looks really oily now
like the places where I felt like I was
going to get oily I am now really oily
and shiny its accentuating my pores
I haven't blotted or anything actually
though I like I did blot once I like one
o'clock or so but I didn't really I just
don't like late this makes my skin look
the covergirl 3 in 1 foundation just
beat this so I'm not digging this
foundation I'm definitely going to give
this to a friend because I don't like it
at all it's just so not flattering for
my skin type maybe if you did have like
big pores and stuff like that or oily
skin you might like this but personally
for me I have bigger larger pores I just
oh I don't like it it is really driving
me insane that I can feel this
foundation on my skin so much and I just
I can't wear it anymore so I'm sorry I'm
kind of short but it just OH it just
didn't work for me so I do apologize I
can't necessarily tell you if I would
repurchase the do or one again because
I'm not really loving that anymore so I
think I'm going to just stick to liquid
foundations
those are my safe places and my favorite
favorite foundation at the moment is the
covergirl three in one so I think I'm
going to stop trying out the airbrush
foundations because they just really
don't work for my skin I know there's
just make everyone flawless but I feel
like it just accentuates my pores and
that's the one thing I hate if I would
have purchased this first and tried it
out and seeing how it wore I probably
want to purchase the Dior so just being
honest also you guys know I am going to
try to bring out bring it back first
impression Friday's they will be every
other
starting now so today next week won't be
one the next week there will be one so
there would be two FIS a month you guys
been requesting it like crazy and you
know I want to do what you want to seize
I hope you enjoyed this video and I will
see you guys in my next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
