my Sephora haul and I did participate in
the vib Rouge sale event that they have
going on I believe it was at the end of
March until April 11th they have a
coupon code for the VIP members the
Beauty insiders and then also the vme
Rouge members I think it's pretty sure
it's 15% off so I leave the code down
below if you want to check it out
so if you're one of those members you
can get the percentage off of your order
and I figured during this time I would
stock up on some items and try a couple
different things out I also have some
joy items for you guys and yeah I'm just
gonna go ahead and get started with this
video because I feel like it's gonna be
a long one so this is the box that I got
mail everything is still pretty much in
its packaging and the first thing that I
stocked up on are these and feet'
elaborado self-tanning mints I just did
a full self-tanning video so if you want
to check that out I'll leave it down
below these are my favorite bits I think
they're about 6 bucks apiece so they're
really nice I have tried the mitts from
Ulta and personally I didn't like them I
felt like they scratched my chest too
much these are definitely my favorites I
love them and I just continue to
repurchase them they're so good okay
next up I did purchase these boscia
green tea blotting linens and I bought
these because spring and summer time
comes the warm weather and then the oily
skin just comes right out at you so I
figured I would try these out I haven't
tried blotting sheets and forever
usually I'll just take like a paper
towel or a tissue and just blot my face
I figured for on the go or something and
these would be great so that's just what
they look like they're really cute and I
believe they're pretty inexpensive and
there are a hundred sheets per thing so
should last me quite a bit I believe
next up I have some stuff from Tarte and
I've been wanting to try this foundation
for a while especially since spring and
summer is coming around of course I want
to try some powder foundations I don't
know if this is gonna be the right shape
for me though this is the tarte
high-performance Naturals Amazonian clay
full coverage airbrush foundation I got
the color medium tan sand so yeah it
comes in this packaging is like the same
packaging as a little foundation that
they have like
I really love that liquid foundation but
you just open it up and it has like a
sifter I believe might be I don't know
I'm gonna have to try the color out but
that's what it looks like and then to go
along with that I heard this was an
awesome brush this is a Tarte air Buki
the bamboo powder foundation brush and
you know it goes along with it so I
figured why not and I needed a more
dense brush to really apply powder
foundations so I figured to succumb and
great handy oh it's so much smaller than
like I expect it to be a little bit
bigger but it is really dense and a nice
quality brush so I'm excited to try this
thing out taking this little package
in here I have the bite beauty of davay
lip mask I've heard so many people
talking about this and I was like you
know what it's a perfect time to try it
out as soon as I get 15% off so this is
just what it looks like again it's kind
of just like a lip treatment that you
can leave on and you get a lot of
product I also got this honest Asya
clear waterproof topcoat it says
instantly waterproofs any mascara and
yeah I believe you could put this on
your brows too so that's just what it
looks like of course I got it again
first spring and summertime and I'm also
going to try a new under eye cream I
love my bobbi brown one you guys know
that I've purchased so many of them by
far my favorite but you know sometimes
just get used to things and I just
wanted to kind of switch it up so I got
this super goop advanced anti-aging eye
cream and it says wrinkle reducing boat
peptide complex with SPF 37 I love the
fact that I had SPF in it it comes like
this just in a little white tube and
then you have like a metal thing at the
end so it's probably gonna be like
really cooling underneath the eyes and I
really like that and the fact that I did
have to stick my finger in it especially
since I have these nails I'm just kind
of going all over the place because I
bought just different stuff things I
really wanted to try and things I just
wanted to kind of stock up on the next
step I have this bamboo smooth candy
candy dry oil micro-mist its ultimate
frizz control for all hair types I had a
little sample of it and I'm actually
almost out of it and I
really loving it so I figured I would
purchase the full-size and I love the
fact that it's a sprite thing like this
so I could just spray on the ends of my
hair when I'm running on 2nd 3rd 4th day
hair or whatever just spray it through
and I'll really smooth it out it's a
really awesome oil it smells so good and
this doesn't like wear your hair down or
anything so I love this last thing in
this packet is the Sephora tinted
self-tanning body mist you guys know I
love self-tanning like I said I just did
a whole video on it and I saw this and
wanted to try it out so yeah I just got
another self tanner to try you guys know
I'll be letting you know if I like it or
not ok so I did get a sample I told you
guys
not too long ago I'm a huge al Genest
fan and I saw that they had this as a
sample again and I always snag up the
sample when I see it on Sephora so I got
the sample of the firming lifting cream
and you can't beat the example sizes
from them because they are great sizes
and you can really try out the product
and I know I love this one so yeah just
got a sample of that speaking of
something high-end for skincare I got
this new body butter I've been trying
different body butters I love first a
beauty's body butters
I love soap &amp;amp; Glory and then I love
clinics but I figured I would try this
one out because I've been suffering from
really really dry legs and if I don't
keep them moisturized they're gonna go
crazy so I got this locket Ain I think
that's how you say it
ultra rich body cream rich in shea
butter this is a huge jar so this is
what it looks like you'll get what do
you get how much do you got here I don't
know but this had amazing reviews and
I've been on the fence about trying it
for a really long time it just smells
clean and it smells like something
that's not gonna interfere with your
perfume which I love that I hate what
motions kind of fight with your perfume
like both this smells so this just
smells clean and refreshing and I have a
sample of the lock tain hand cream and
I've been really enjoying it I just
don't know if I want to spend the money
on like the full-size okay another
boring item I
we purchase my purity facial wash I love
this stuff I think it is perfect I'm
almost out of mine I know a lot of
people like to get these off of QVC and
HSN I just purchased mine off of Sephora
I like to get the points and things like
that I also got this Stila duo in kits
in and it's just the highlighting duo so
it has a kitten shade and then the
darker shade on the other side so I love
kitten as well I have the eye shadow and
I use that as a highlight a lot but I
figured this one was really cute and I
liked the fact that I had a bronzy side
for like summer I just I love colors
like that so that's just what it looks
like this has been shown so many times I
love that bronze color that's just
absolutely stunning when I'm tan in the
summer that it's going great and kitten
can just an amazing color like you
cannot go wrong with kitten okay I also
got this Clarins
one-step gentle exfoliating cleanser
with orange extract it says for all skin
types
I needed a good exfoliator for a while
since I don't use my Clarisonic anymore
I need to find things like this to
compensate with so yeah I figured it
would try this out again I had good
reviews and I can't wait to see if I
like it or not okay and then I got this
Laura Mercier smooth focused pressed
setting powder shine control huge powder
junkie right here actually anything to
do with face like concealers powders
foundations I'm all about so I love
trying different items I have put myself
on a foundation no buy right now because
I need to seriously use the boards that
I have but it's powders I'm always
interested in trying some more so I just
heard regular compact HD you get a
little puff in it and the powder is
super fine kind of leaves like a little
bit of a white cast I don't I'll see how
I like this and it will you guys know
okay so last few things again to hair
products these are the smaller sizes so
I didn't pay like the full size price
cuz I wanted to just try them out this
is a living proof full thickening cream
it says bunny boosting volume creating
nice
moving I don't know that made absolutely
no sense but again this had great
reviews and I figured I would try it out
I've heard a lot of things about this
and I also got the living proof prime
style extender it says lob speed in your
style longer it says use alone or under
other stylers so I'm excited to try this
out I've seen this in magazines for like
the longest time and I've just been so
interested so yeah I think these are
like ten dollars or something in a piece
ten or twelve dollars because these are
the smaller sizes but they're great to
purchase if you just want to try it out
this is called the blonds and it's just
the humongous bronzing brush this is
literally the softest brush I've ever
felt in my life I have been a supporter
of times and have felt this and I'm just
like oh I want it so bad but I just
never bought it this is what it looks
like it's such a luxury brush like Oh
even if I don't use this for a bronzer I
could totally use it for powder and it's
just oh so gorgeous and it feels so good
okay so onto the giveaway I always say
