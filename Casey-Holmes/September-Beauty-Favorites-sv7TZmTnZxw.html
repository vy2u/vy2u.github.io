my September favorites and I actually
don't have a lot of makeup like I
usually do but I do have quite a few
stuff I want to mention to you guys I'm
gonna go ahead and start with makeup
first and you know I'm just going to
start with the thing you guys are seeing
the most probably this month because I
cannot stop wearing it it's so good I
just can't help myself and I wear it in
almost every video every tutorial I have
been loving the covergirl outlast three
and one foundations these are just
beautiful I have 855 and 857 and
depending on my self tanner I'll mix
these I'll use one just depends on how
my self tanner is looking for the day
but these are by far my favorite
foundations from the drugstore I guess
like a nice satin finish you set it with
a powder you're gonna be matte and it
gives really great full coverage if you
want to see it in action
I will leave my current foundation
routine down below so you can check them
out and see how well they cover another
thing you guys will see in my current
foundation routine which will be down
below like I said is this concealer from
Jane I love this concealer I think it is
a great alternative for the Mac Pro
Longwear if you don't want to go
purchase these definitely try this out I
think it's really similar because it
doesn't sink it to my fine lines it
lasts all day
it looks really gorgeous and covers like
everything underneath your eyes being on
I absolutely love this I think it's
amazing and I just I really like the
Jane line so far I think it's a really
great drugstore line speaking of Jane I
do have this bronzer I want to mention
first off the packaging it's too cute
right so this isn't the color in power
it's like a really nice deep brown and I
love this because it's not orange or
anything like that actually used it to
contour today and it's just perfect I'm
gonna create the most amazing shadow on
your face and I highly recommend that it
doesn't have shimmer when you look at it
but once you apply to your face you
can't even see it this bronzer I want to
mention because I am obsessed with it
for $4 you cannot go wrong I've said
that probably like 10 times this month
and I know a lot of you probably over
seeing it but you know I love it so I
gotta mention it this is the NYC
Braun's bronzing powder in Montauk
bronze I have never seen anyone talk
about these and I'm so surprised because
it's stunning like I've used it so much
I'm starting to see the pan from around
the rim come through really nicely and
that's when you know you've been using
it a lot I absolutely adore this if you
want to see it in action go check out my
bold lip tutorial because you will see
how much of a gorgeous bronze look it as
the skin I mean it's done next I want to
talk about my NARS powders these are
just regular face powders I have the
colors Beach and mountain I didn't show
leave enough love you know throughout
the months that I've had them so I
decided to start using them more and I
just realized how much I love these I
used to rave about these all the time
when I first started my channel here on
YouTube because I had mountain and then
I ran out and I just never repurchased
it these are so so nice I highly
recommend them I feel like you could
Polly's on and they will never look
cakey because like there's such a fine
powder it doesn't add like a lot of
coverage to your skin it just sets your
foundation really well and just creates
like this soft effect to your face
moving on to skin care I'm going to have
a whole skincare video up what I'm gonna
do I'm gonna do it a little bit
differently cuz I want to sit down and
just talk to you about each product I'd
rather show you and kind of do a
voiceover so I'm gonna be filming myself
in the morning for my skincare and then
eat at night before I go to bed and then
I'll put them on together do a voiceover
and you'll see my whole skin care
routine for a day and night but I'm
gonna mention these two products to you
because they're amazing
and the first one is this lush tea tree
water and this is a toner it's
beneficial for anyone with oily or
acne-prone skin hi that's me this is so
good I got it at lush I think like a
little over a month ago I spray this on
my face right after I wash it so right
and it's nice and clean i spritz this
all over I probably spray it too much on
my face but I just love the way it feels
notice that I haven't really had a
breakout at all and my redness has gone
down so much I mean I feel like this is
so beneficial and my skincare routine
along with the Clarisonic just because I
don't know I really really like it I
think it's done a lot for my skin when I
don't use it I do
it's like a couple breakouts but I mean
it's as long as I keep using it it's
amazing my skincare routine I'm not
gonna lie to you guys it is expensive
I had to repurchase them and I posted in
a tweet the other day cuz literally
almost everything is ran out so I had to
purchase everything I posted a tweet the
other day I was like I love having a
higher in skincare routine but I hate
paying for it and it is so freakin true
but this is a nighttime moisturizer I
actually purchased and I had a sample of
it completely fell in love and I had to
have the full size I just knew I had to
have it it's the philosophy full of
promise and it's the dual-action
restoring cream for volume and lift I
put this on at night and I could just
tell it like makes my face feel so I
don't know like plump and just so soft
and in the morning when I wake up my
skin looks amazing so I've been loving
philosophy products for my skin care
which you will see in that video that I
show you but this has been a newer
purchase and I did use that whole sample
up but it's my nighttime cream I'm
absolutely in love with it for haircare
I want to mention this product I will
have a hair care routine coming for you
guys I've got recorded and everything
I'm trying to get some other videos out
before that one but it is coming for you
but this is also mentioned in there it's
the kinder platinum recovery polished
restore and refine it says new on here
so I'm guessing it's new I got it from
the salon like a month or so ago and
this is great stuff now it says recovery
polish is an ultra lightweight
restorative leave-in treatment that
combats dehydration and smoothes the
damaged cuticle layer for an incredible
softness shine and definition with
natural movement that was a long
sentence like that was one whole
sentence sounds crazy but I completely
agree with this like completely when I'm
going on third or fourth day hair and
you know sometimes you're in jitters
looking a little dry I spray I spray I
pump a couple pumps of this into my hand
work it out you'll kind of see it looks
a little bit oily but it's not launching
put it on your ends you'll be good to go
just drive between my hands put all
throughout my ends and it just looks so
good it looks nice and shiny again
refresh it feels really soft and I just
and I really really like this product
especially when I use the pinnacle wand
which is the deep waver that I had in my
bullet pickup tutorial you can see my
hair is wavy in that like I had to brush
out my hair so it looked a little poofy
I just took a couple pumps of this put
it throughout my ends and it just looked
nice and sealed together and it didn't
look poufy or frizzy or anything like
that so I love this stuff it has
definitely been worth it I think kinder
is a great brand everything I have tried
from kenra has been amazing and I know
you can get it at Ulta self tanner this
month I have had so many questions from
you guys what I have been using and I
have actually purchased both of these
self tanners again this month because I
ran out of both of them and it is the
essential pay dark and the Vita Liberata
and dark now I'm a self tanning addict
we all know I love trying self tanners I
love trying new ones and I've actually I
think mentioned both of these in
favourites videos before and speaking of
beauty Liberata this is by far my
favorite mid I did have a mint from
Saint Tropez but it is that like getting
really big and sliding all over the
place and this one it doesn't last as
long as it's a Tropez it will kind of I
don't know like like I kept using it
after a few times and then this sides
just popped up so my finger poke through
and it had a hole in it but this is a
smaller mint so I like this one a lot
better because when I'm applying my
self-tanner it's not like moving all
over the place like that and I have a
hard time blending it in if you just
spread my hand out and buff it in really
easily with these and I bought a lot of
them so I love these back to the
self-tanner what I like to do is apply
like the Saint Tropez first I'll apply
it all over my body let it dry for a
quick sec and then I'll put the V
deliver on it on top I have a whole blog
post on my favorite self tanners I've
ever tried and I will leave that down
below yes birthday on me
oh my freaking freaking out and I was
gonna get to I do like I said the same
trip a home first the V deliver on over
top once it dries it's a really gorgeous
tan the only bad thing about it and it
pisses me off just like I did right now
is these mousse jars leak I don't know
what the hell the problem is but the st.
Tropez has leaked on me I've got it on
my actual palm this leaks and obviously
the V I'm not even picking up the Vita
Liberata cuz you just thought leaked all
over my hands
fix your packaging because that's the
kind of stuff that will piss everybody
off and not want to purchase your
product just sayin
moving on I do have another st. tropez
product this is actually a one that was
recommended by Lauren Beauty she did a
whole self-tanning video I saw her
mention this and I had to try it it's
the st. Tropez tan optimizing body
butter I love this for when I'm getting
out of the shower and have my rows are
going on I just apply this over top of
the rose argan so it's like an extra
deep moisturizer and it really does help
my tan last a lot longer so I highly
highly highly recommend this it's really
good I'll put the link below where you
can get it this is be able a juicy
perfume I used to use this for a good
few years and I ran out of it last year
never repurchase it but I finally did
this used to be my signature scent and
it's back to being my signature scent
because I think that this is the only
perfume I have that actually lingers
throughout the entire day and I get
constant compliments so this is by far
my favorite perfume so last thing I want
to mention are my phone cases and these
are from a wildflower cases calm they
are so kind at beautycon they did give
me this and then they sent me this one
as well
they're not paying me to talk to you
guys about them I just love their cases
so this one is of course the flag with a
cross on it my two favorite things and
then this one is of course another one
of my favorites the camo with studs
these are great quality I've actually
dropped my phone face down like
this did not crack it all hallelujah
because I would have been freaking out I
love these cases they're so cute I feel
like there's such a statement like this
is an accessory it's so gorgeous you can
tell how sturdy these are and just
they're all handmade and I highly
recommend them so I'll put their link
below you should definitely check them
out it's a really great family oriented
company and they were so sweet me me and
Colt pumps them forever at beautycon and
their story of how they got started was
just so amazing and it's just it's so
crazy to see when something's meant to
be it'll happen so I love this company
you should definitely check them out
because their cases are so cute okay
guys that's pretty much it I'm gonna go
lemon juice my hand now since we had a
little technical difficulty
but I hope you guys enjoyed this video
thank you so much for watching and don't
forget to give it a big thumbs up and I
