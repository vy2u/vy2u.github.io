but I did from this video when it was
going down so if the color changes like
I look orange or something that is why
but this tutorial is on this hair that
you guys have been asking about that I
had in one of my videos I'm just gonna
behind let you know you just need your
favorite thermal spray which I sprayed
mine before I fill in the tutorial so
mine is the Chi iron guard so I sprayed
it all over my hair and then the only
thing you'll need to be using is a
straightener and I used this one-inch to
do or C do whatever I onyx ceramic pro
Flatiron straightener just looks like
this I love this one because it glides
through my hair the only problem is and
you'll see me having trouble with it in
the video it does not have a swivel cord
so I kinda have to let it unravel but
this is it and yeah I think I used
hairspray to and if I did I use the
suave touchable finish hairspray extra
hold but I hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial or hope you do enjoy it and I
will see you on the next video you know
I'm going to show you guys how I got
that curly hair in the video I asked you
guys what you wanted to see this is I
did half of it already and this is what
it's looking like you can do this a
second day hair or whatever I'm gonna go
ahead and it started already explained
pretty much everything in the beginning
of the video so let's get started um
what you can do is obviously my hair is
halfway up and my buddies are gonna go
miners but you can take I take bigger
sections because I don't like spending
three thousand hours on my hair um when
I'm curling it I take about that big of
a section sorry about the lines by the
way with the lines the only thing that
sucks about this strainer is is not a
swivel board whatever so I'm gonna take
about this much hair I'm gonna make my
wrist go down because all of my curls
will be away from my face that's how I
always do my curls I don't like them to
be you know coming towards my face I
don't like that so you take it with your
wrist down excuse my roots um your wrist
is down and you just want to clamp it
halfway bring it down and kind of hold
the ends while you pull
and then you just get this little curl
on the bottom and what we're gonna do is
we're CAF way down and then we'll go
back to the roots and fix them so like I
said that one's over here take another
section kind of varies how big I want
them to be but I'll go about this big
now it's like an inch or so and again
wrist facing down you clamp it halfway
flip it over
hold your ends and pull down and that's
what you got I like doing my ends like
halfway down first before because it
just makes a difference to me with how
it looks and stuff like that and for me
I have told end and if you have really
hung long hair you have to hold it hold
the ends because your hair will slip out
the straightener more than likely so
just keep going until you got all the
halfway part done this is also a good
way to make sure you curled your ends
like all the ends of your hair is curled
because you don't want that one strand
that's like straight so just like that
okay so night that you got all of it
halfway down done you're gonna go start
back at the root again and there's a
thing that I do to this so when I start
back at the root and you see where this
ends right you take the clamp up to your
root flip it over again hold and you see
where I first started halfway I'm gonna
let that clamp go there that's up in it
let's see let the cleanup go where I
went half way down day I turned it off
that's why it's not working give it a
minute takes about 30 seconds to eat up
but that's pretty much what I do
um because I stopped right here because
I don't want to add extra heat to that
part that I just curled so and plus it
kind of gives you like these sexy curls
it doesn't ruin the straighten of hair
at all like with how the curl looks and
stuff it just goes along with it if you
do it right see it's already heated up
so
like I said just take it clamp it flip
it over go down to where you start
halfway and let go like that and of
course later on you can fix whatever you
don't like so again take your strand you
see where you ended halfway or you
started your halfway and you clamp it
flip over hold till you get to a halfway
point and then let go and sometimes
they'll start looking like this kind of
like weird looking like I said you could
always go back and just flip it out like
this is just the easiest way to curl
your hair but you kind of have to know
the technique to kind of fix stuff it's
really not hard I swear to you I'm
probably confusing the heck out of you I
swear it's not this hard clamp flip over
halfway point let go like that and see
sometimes if it looks a little flat like
that you can go take the ends or the
clamp again go on the ends and flip it
you know do whatever you want so again
do this one
and then this is not really crawled on
the end so I'm just gonna let it go
through like that okay so this is just
the beginning you don't have to start
freaking out couldn't like the way
acrylics if you don't really like one
you can go back through and just curl
that little and you don't have to take
that whole section again just get the
little part that you don't like and fix
it like that and this sides a lot
thicker than this side so that's why
this one's kind of like hot whoops
and this one's lower because there's a
lot more hair on this side of my head so
also again going to take section of my
hair down I'm taking about that much not
much at all just leaving the basic like
top layer up alright so horrible you
guys I have to get them done I felt so
much better when my roots are done cuz
like and I feel like a whole new woman
so click the upper part up what that
looks and then we're gonna start on this
side so come on bangs I'm gonna take how
much I want need my a little bit okay so
I'm going to take when I get kind of
closer to the top I kind of take smaller
sections so this one's I'm going to take
about hmmm that much I'm going to go up
towards the top more that's when I start
the root and just go all the way through
the bottom part is pretty much right of
the whole halfway thing and then I get
up here and I'm gonna clamp it my wrist
is going like that is going outwards see
if I can fix this for y'all okay that
works um it's gonna be flipped like this
clamp it hold the ends while you twist
down and but a vein
there's your curl so simple and then
again I'm taking another section about
this much about an inch
wrist is always facing down hold and
when you start getting up more at least
of me I start twirling it more twisting
it out more it's really not hard so you
kind of get that curl like that I don't
really switch the way the curls go like
forwards and backwards and stuff like
that because that's just too much work
so I'm gonna make that smaller again
take this section clamp it and twist it
so I'm gonna finish this whole part of
my hair
you know buddy shot as you can see I did
pretty much my whole bottom layer now I
just put brought down my top layer so we
go curl this and as you can see it's
very voluminous I love curling with a
straightener because I think they look
really nice try to get away this line -
stuff going on I think they look really
voluminous and really pretty so what I'm
gonna do I'm gonna brush through the top
I'm gonna have to kind of look this way
see what I'm doing and I like to take
smaller section well not really I'm
lying I take about this big of a section
with my top layer and all I like to do I
don't like to go too close to the root
with this one I kind of just take about
there and I twist it out just so I can
get that curl but I don't get like a
huge curl like I want just kind of the
volume on top so let me show you again
and that's what it came out like just
take it again and let it go and you just
get this nice kind of volumous curl so
when you kind of run your fingers
through your hair it's like not super
curly up top goes out like that look so
then
take this layer the same thing this one
in half and I'm just going to curl away
like so straightener be so much more
amazing that will record my do it one
more time
dad I'm gonna do this part
like that so you see what we're getting
right here just kind of that sexy volume
is Carl but I am I'm gonna kind of curl
this a little bit more around my face
just to give it kinda like a frame or
whatever so that's that side bear I love
this look I've always done this to my
questions about it like when I went to
high school and stuff when I did my hair
like this - oh my god how'd you do that
I guess the simplest thing ever just use
a straightener so I'm gonna go ahead and
finish the side do the same thing that I
did on this side on this side and I'll
be before the bangs all I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna take my bangs which these are
them right here I don't like to
Crowley's very much I just like to
basically take the ends out so it looks
like they blend in but they're not like
a curl so so I still kind of get this
look you know any mean like the side
sweat look with the curls so I just take
the ends and I just really light like go
out like that like you see I just go
what just a little feather nothing crazy
and that's what I again it's kind of
like I don't know like Texas hair like
baby I feel good in the summer when I
have this hair like a super dark tan no
makes me feel good and like if you want
to you could use hairspray and tease
that I felt like this is enough of
volume so and yeah how you guys like
this I you all have been asking for a
trial like this um so that stuff the
sun's going in and out - if I don't know
why I like my face is turning orange
it's not trying on orange I don't know
but this is the look and you see how I
kind of do mine like I just like it to
look kind of flatter on top and then
more volume on the bottom like just do
big curls up here and then do it smaller
at the bottom and of course like I have
random strays
this one better like mentally ill so I
gotta crawl that there you go so I hope
you guys enjoyed this tutorial on this
hair I personally love doing this to my
hair I just OH
I'm obsessed with it so I hope I wasn't
too confusing I know it was my first
tutorial so I was like oh but I hope you
guys enjoyed it and I'll see you on my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
