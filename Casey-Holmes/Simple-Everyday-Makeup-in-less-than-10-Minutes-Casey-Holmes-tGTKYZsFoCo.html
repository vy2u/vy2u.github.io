showing you my go to less than 10 minute
of makeup look this is a really easy
love to do I love the products in this
video I have a mixture of high-end and
more affordable products the foundation
I used is by ex1 I believe this is
pretty affordable though I don't think
it's high-end at all I love this
foundation for everyday wear it's color
right now matches me perfectly I have on
this lorac spray tan thing that it's not
a permanent self tan but it's something
that I'm doing right now so I can get my
whole body exfoliated and like get my
dryness under control because if you see
the last couple videos it's a little
rough
it matches that like.oh perfectly
seriously it just it just matches it
perfectly I hope you guys enjoyed this
look I love this look I think minimal
makeup is just as beautiful as a
dramatic dark smoky eye so give this
video a thumbs up if you liked it and I
hope you don't mind this setup right now
I'm just kind of sitting here usually
sitting all the way over there but now
I'm in my vanity so it's give me a
little bit to kind of figure out where I
want to sit in this room if you like
this video please give it a thumbs up
and don't forget to subscribe and let's
just go ahead and get started with this
makeup look okay so obviously I gotta
start off by having some green tea I'm
showing you the time and we're gonna go
ahead and get started so I'm taking the
ex1 a foundation this is the invisibly
foundation and f 400 works a little
crazy at first but I promise you it
blends in perfectly and it matches these
self-tanner so don't worry it's just the
contrast from the pale face to the tan
foundation I personally like using a
foundation I don't like using tinted
moisturizers or anything just because I
have rosacea and things I want to cover
up and it takes me just as long to blend
in foundation as it would a tinted
moisturizer so that's just the route I
like to go now I'm gonna go ahead and
take the NYX HD concealer and put this
underneath my eyes and I'm gonna use my
fingers first to kind of hurry up and
spread out this product and then I will
be going in and using a brush to blend
it all out and
little Daisy she got shaved so she kinda
looks like a little naked mole-rat okay
anyways so back to the concealer I'm
gonna take my brush and also help blend
it out as well and this just helps
everything go on seamlessly and it's
actually pretty quick going from my
fingers to the brush and then after that
I'm going to put this on my nose as well
and then I'm gonna drag whatever excess
product I have on to the center of my
forehead like right between my brows and
then on my chin just to highlight and
give the face a little extra and that
make it look so flat taking the Kat Von
D shade and light palette I'm gonna take
the V net the banana the banana colored
powder and I'm going to set all of my
concealer also set the concealer on my
eyelids because if I don't it will
crease on me then we are going to brow
tint which I couldn't find it for the
longest time and I was like I'm being
timed here where are you and then I
finally found it so this is the Ulta
brow tint in a medium brown or not deep
there it is says deep and I'm going to
put this on my brows I actually really
really love this I like it more than my
benefit gimme brow so far it's like half
the price and it does the same exact
thing and it looks so natural then I'm
taking this elf blush palette this is
the lighter version of the two and I'm
gonna mix those two shades and put them
on my cheeks and this is just gonna give
a nice bronzy glow and the pink really
helps add like a little bit of
healthiness back into your skin and you
just look alive and awake and then you
want to blend it out and then for
highlight I'm gonna take this one from
Mac it's called perfect topping and this
is Beth this has been my favorite
highlight of the moment just because it
really gives you a beautiful glow it
doesn't have like a lot of shimmer or
anything in it so it doesn't look too
overdone but I'm telling you the glow it
gives you is beautiful I tightline with
that Revlon eyeliner and then I'm going
on to the Too Faced better than sex
mascara which is my favorite mascara for
times like this when I just need to
hurry up and get it done and get my
makeup on and go because this makes my
lashes look amazing and like such a
short amount of time I love this mascara
so much it's just oh make sure lashes
look so beautiful so I'm gonna put that
on my top and lower lashes and then for
lips I'm gonna mix these two items from
NYX
I liked the matte lip
cream I put on first but I just wanted
to kind of liven up the lips a little
bit and not make it look so flat so I
put a gloss on top as well and it just
really adds a gorgeous glow and makes
you look healthy and put together and
the names of everything will be listed
down below in the description box so I'm
also gonna put that highlighter by the
way by Mac in the inner corners just to
brighten up the eyes and then you're
done with the look so I hope you guys
enjoyed this I'm sorry this videos a
little bright just bear with me like I
said while I'm figuring out where I'm
trying to sit in film in this room so
thank you guys again so much for
