box so enough about the giveaway if you
want to see how I got this makeup look
and a few first impressions that I tried
on camera for you then just keep
watching
so the first portion of this video I am
gonna do that smokey eye but I'm gonna
do a voiceover for this part so yeah
let's go ahead and be on the smokey eye
and then we'll come back and talk
through these new face products starting
off I'm gonna go ahead and prime my eyes
just so these shadows last all day and
don't crease I'm using the NARS smudge
proof eyeshadow primer then going in
with the urban decay ultimate Nasik
makes it make it basics palette I'm
gonna take this yellow shade right here
and I'm going to put this all over the
lid just to set that primer and make
sure that all the other shadows glide on
easily
then I'm gonna go in with this mid-tone
Brown right here and I'm gonna put this
into my crease just to add as a
transition shade and I'm using a nice
fluffy blending brush to put this in
there then I'm also going up towards the
brow where my two duct area is I'm just
learning a little bit up more and yeah
getting this all over that crease area
then I'm gonna take this orange Shay
which you guys know I love I'm gonna
have to do like a makeup look with just
this orange shade and I'm going to put
this into a Derby and also in the crease
I'm going a little bit below the first
shade that we did apply and I'm using a
smaller blending brush to apply this
going in with this black right here this
is a really nice black and it blends out
very well taking this smaller precise
brush I'm gonna put this into the crease
and outer V but I'm going to go about
half way into the crease you see me
blending in towards the inner corner but
that's just to help blend so there's not
a harsh line then I'm going to take a
blending brush and blend out the edges
of that black just so it's not super
harsh or anything like that going on my
favorite shade which is this one right
here I absolutely love it I'm going to
use a flat shading brush and I'm gonna
put this all over the lid to really
deepen this look up I like it because
it's a really deep plum II Brown but
it's not a black so it's not too intense
you know I'm saying it just gives you
that nice smoky look
then I'm going in with the orange shade
again and I'm just blending out the
edges of these shadows just to make sure
they blend it nice and seamlessly after
that I'm gonna do a winged eyeliner I
use the Make Up For Ever ink eyeliner
which is a nice matte black and then I'm
gonna use my Shayla lashes from flutter
lashes and then the eye look is complete
so super super easy and really dramatic
which is my favorite okay I feel like a
new woman when I put false lashes on and
I have a smoky eye
I feel good feel good we're gonna move
on to some the new products that I went
to try on camera for you guys I'm going
to start with this laura geller spackle
treatment mattifying makeup primer this
is what it looks like I got this from
Ulta and of course is the mattifying one
for oily skin that's what it looks like
right there just gonna apply this all
over not all over it but like at the
center of my face kind of looks like it
whenever I pour it nicely moving on I am
going to use the anastacio stick
foundation I love this stick foundation
I think it's amazing I had to get a
couple other shades because the other
ones were just way too warm so I'm gonna
try this shade and natural which looks a
little light I also got a different
shade as well so right now I have four
shades of the Sun nation cuz I'm trying
to find that perfect color so this one's
the shade golden caramel did match
pretty well I just don't know it looks
good after concealer and stuff you know
what I'm saying so this one is golden
that looks like it's gonna match me oh I
don't know I'm just gonna mix a few
shades to get my like perfect shade I'm
gonna take the colors natural and
caramel and mix them on my face this is
natural then I'm going to add some
caramel with that
now nation looks so good on my skin I
just love it covers up everything I like
to use it with me you'll endure I know
some people get onto me for like swiping
my Beauty Blender like this but honestly
I just get to a point where I'm so tired
of tapping it and I start swiping it so
that's why I do that okay now we're
going to try out a new concealer I just
purchased this off of Sephora it came in
today see Becca aqua luminous perfecting
concealer in light don't know how the
shade range is hopefully this is okay
but we're gonna find out oh that is
light we're just gonna we're gonna work
with it so whoo that applicator is
different that's what the applicator
looks like and that's the shade light
and it is light so we're gonna have to
definitely bronze the skin definitely
have to dip the one back in the product
quite a bit to get some more off just
FYI I'm gonna take my Beauty Blender and
win this out first I want to say this
concealer is $30 this looks nice it is
not too full coverage in my opinion it
reminds me of the Too Faced Born This
Way concealer full coverage like the
Tarte chip tape concealer I have been
really loving the tarp shape tape
concealer with this anasazi foundation I
think they look gorgeous
together and then topping it off with my
flower booty translucent powder they
look so good I think if you have really
intense under-eye circles and stiff just
stuff you want to cover I do think
you're gonna have to color correct and
then go in with this to like it but if
you're like me and you don't really have
too much to cover you kind of just want
to brighten this is nice I'm gonna use
it a little bit more but so far first
impression I'm not impressed
all right now that we have a buttload of
powder on our face we're gonna go in
with a brow product and I love the
benefit to brow you guys know this but I
want to try something new so I'm trying
something from Anastasio I'm gonna try
Anastasi as brow definer I'm not huge on
pencils so I'm not gonna be too harsh on
this because I know I'm not like a big
fan of pencil ones but I just really
want to try it this reminds me of a Dior
brow product I'm using right now so I
just kind of want to see the difference
between the two so you do have a spoolie
on the end it's not like the brow Wiz
where it's a super thin pencil it's kind
of thicker and this is in the shade soft
brown oh that is stiff let's warm it up
a little bit Jesus so that soft Brown
ooh that blends really nicely see this
right here is why I don't like pencils
because I could never get this part
right but the formulas really nice all
right honestly it's just taking too long
for me to put it on my brows so I'm just
gonna go in with my pomade
I don't know if you guys could tell from
my previous videos but you do not like
spending a lot of time on my brows I
don't know what it is just not fun for
me anyway something I'm trying to say
the product is that because it's not has
a great formula and it's not too hard to
apply and it blends out really well I
figured I would just test value guys
know if I liked it because it is a
thicker pencil so I was thinking maybe
be a little bit quicker so I'm going and
with this what is this calm 3d brow
tones from benefit I'm just going to put
this on to kind of lighten them up make
them look a little bit more natural like
this is all with that pencil and it
looks good I'm just like super impatient
about this bronzer palette from Ulta
it's the butter LONDON
bronzer clutch and this has a four piece
contouring palette that shapes defines
and brightens three universal primary
Feud shades and a highlighting pin for
an effortless contoured face so I swatch
these in the store and they just looked
so beautiful you have a really big
mirror and then these shades you have
like a kind of highlight looking shade
right here a more warm tone and then a
more ashy tone bronzer so I'm gonna take
the more warm tone one and bronze up my
face and to do that I'm going to use
this japonesque brush
then I'm gonna take the more a sheet
tone in this palette and contour with it
I'm gonna use I'm gonna use mine RZ to
brush yes look at that color
these blends so well then I'm gonna do
something to go in with one of these new
what Marc Jacobs blushes and I think I'm
gonna do this one this one's called pink
and kisses and I'm gonna take the blush
brush that they sent just mix them all
together I think there's like a certain
way you're supposed to apply these but
I'm just gonna mix them together cuz I
get time for that that's a pretty pink
color good nice rosy shade i likey I
just want a little heavy with it but I
like it I'm going to blend it out the
way I apply blush is like I apply a lot
and then I blend it out and hopes that
it blends out really well because the
blush is I normally use do now I'm going
to take this new Urban Decay Naked
illuminating trio it has three different
highlights so we're gonna see if it's
good hopefully they're not too literally
so this is what the palette looks like
absolutely gorgeous then it has a little
highlighting brush which I guess we
could use why not right and then you
have three different shades right here
I'm gonna go for the middle one see what
this looks like swatch these look really
glittery and they are let's actually mix
these two
not going too far on my face like too
far down because this type of glitter /
shimmer really emphasizes texture pores
so more than anything I would probably
use this for my body but mm not so much
for my face it adds too much of a
textured look and I just I don't really
like that and I got the highlight on my
lips and it's a little bit grainy so
don't know about that let's just close
to the body yes see now for a body
highlight this is gorgeous
but don't really like it for the face
then once you blend it out kind of
blends out to like a glow I guess that's
just the shimmer left over but you know
personal preference here and then I'm
going to take my Urban Katee and naked
ultimate basics palette I'm actually
gonna go in with the shade below pretty
though
I like that highlight shade that is
definitely more of a sheen than a matte
before my eyes I am going to line my
waterline I'm gonna use this Sephora
waterproof crayon in black right yes
black they also have a smaller version
of this which I would recommend I can't
find it right now I take the shade
lethal which is wipe it all over my lid
we're going to press that up against
that lower lash line
so I'm going to go in with faith which
is the first color that we used right
here I'm going to blend out lethal
for lips these come out September 19th I
really like this formula I think it's
great so Laura Pro liquid lipstick I
think these are gonna be exclusive to
Kohl's I'm pretty sure which kind of
sucks I wish they would put these in
Altos because I don't think everybody
has the Kohl's I mean everybody don't
have it all - either but I don't know so
this is in the shade plumberry
but it just seems like my kind of color
so surprised I haven't use it yet blitz
yes oh my god I love this color you
smell so good okay guys so I hope you
