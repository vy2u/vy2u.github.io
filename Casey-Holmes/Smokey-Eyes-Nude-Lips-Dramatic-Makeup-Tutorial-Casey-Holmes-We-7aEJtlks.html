for the truth though hey guys so today's
video is going to be a makeup tutorial
on this look it's just a really dramatic
look and I haven't done this nude of
uplifts twenties I haven't done this
nude of a lip in a really long time and
I wanted to do something really dramatic
with the eyes and nice and nude for the
lips and you can do this any time of the
year I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video if you do like it don't forget to
give it a thumbs up and yeah let's just
go ahead and get started with the video
okay first you obviously want to start
off with a bare face and we're gonna
take one of my all-time favorite
palettes in an Isaiah lorac Pro palette
the first edition and we're gonna take
the color taupe and blend this all over
our crease and on the lid boland it
everywhere this is gonna be our
transition shade and you just want to
make sure you really really blend this
out then I'm gonna take the color sable
and I'm going to be putting this into
the crease and my last video is a little
bit similar to this but this one is
definitely a little bit more bold and
more smoky and we're not being as
precise in the crease we're gonna really
completely smoke everything out so don't
be afraid to use some dark colors in
this video but I'm gonna take sable like
I said and just put this all into the
crease and blend it out as much as
possible going from the inner corner
where the tear duct is all the way to
the outer V then I'm gonna just take my
blending brush and I'm just going to
Blinn as I go because looks like this
that are really dramatic are just all
about blending just blend blend and then
a little more then I'm going to take a
spresso with a pencil brush and I'm
going to do the same exact thing I did
with sable but I'm gonna put this right
underneath it so you're gonna see
espresso sable taupe and then the brow
shade like the brow bone highlight so
you're just gonna put a spresso right
underneath sable and again kind of
following that whole line that we made
going from the inner tear-duct to the
outer corner I'm really really
putting this color in there because I
want to be very smoky and for some
reason I've been really loving putting
color in the inner corner and then I'm
gonna take my Too Faced glitter glue I
like to use this for pigments as well I
just think it really helps the pigment
adhere to the lid and not get all over
the place throughout the day so I love
that product she's not just for glitters
but for pigments as well so I'm gonna
take this pigment from Alexis purse Co
Cosmetics I believe and put that on my
lid I'll have all the colors listed down
below and then I'm gonna go back in with
espresso and touch up that crease shade
and make sure it's really nice and deep
you can see my right eye which looks
like my left eye for you guys but my
right eye I ended up taking off my
makeup and reapplying it because I was
just not having it but I did the exact
same thing to the other eye and I'm just
putting it that pigment on again and
then blending as I go
then for eyeliner I'm gonna take my BH
Cosmetics gel eyeliner and you're just
gonna want to line the upper lash line
nothing crazy
you can just do a thin line and then
what we're gonna do is we're going to
apply eyelashes and lashes I'm using are
these by house of lashes and pixie luxe
these have a very thick band
I wouldn't recommend them for someone
who is just starting out with lashes
because I think they're really difficult
in my personal opinion I would recommend
velour if you want to spend good money
on lashes but house of lashes it's
definitely a little bit tricky to work
with sometimes mainly that style though
and then I'm gonna take my Estee Lauder
Double Wear foundation and put this all
over my skin and of course go in my Mac
Pro Longwear and put this in the same
areas I always do this video was
prefilled it's been a while so I've been
using some different foundations and
stuff so just stay tuned to see that and
then I'm gonna take this honest Asya
contour kit and the only shade we all
know that I use in this palette which is
the banana shade and set my concealer
and then I'm taking my s a lot of
bronzer and we're just gonna go ahead
and bronze the skin I believe I got this
at a CCO I can't remember the name but
like I said I will leave it in the
description box for you guys
then I'm taking my Too Faced chocolate
Soleil bronzer I'm just gonna apply this
where I would contour I really like this
bronzer shade it's just been coming back
into my life recently and I think it's
really really beautiful M blends really
amazing you gotta have a tea break and
then this blush you guys I didn't
realize how much I use this blush but I
can't stop it's so good its NARS blush
and Madley just look at it oh I love it
so I'm gonna put that on my cheeks and
blend it out and then of course topping
everything off with this highlighter
from Bobbi Brown and copper diamond
because it is beautiful and it's
literally a copper diamond it's so
stunning I love it when I put on the
tops of my cheekbones bridge of my nose
and also on my lips filling my brows in
with this Mac deep dark brunette flew in
line and then moving on to liner I'm
taking the NARS eyeliner in via veneto I
love this if you have watery eyes or
just have a hard time with liner
smudging you would love this and then
I'm gonna go in and take that pigment
again and this is the only shade we'll
be using on the lower lash line I wanted
to make sure that burnt orange color
really really popped with this look so
that's the only shade I'm gonna be using
I'm really gonna pack this color on
because I want you to be able to see it
and then I'm gonna go in with a blending
brush just a regular blending brush and
you the Sigma has one called an e25 but
I'm just gonna go in and blend that out
just so there's not a harsh line
underneath there and then after you do
that you just want to apply it bottom
lash mascara this look is super easy to
recreate and I really really love it you
can honestly use any pigment or glitter
that you want and then just use the
lorac Pro the first edition and you're
good to go
then I'm gonna take the color white in
the palette I'm gonna highlight my brow
bone with this this will really help
lift the brows and kind of bring the
whole look together and awkward posing
and trying to show them off and then I'm
dancing it's really awkward but then
we're moving on to lips I want to say
that gloss makes my lips look ten times
bigger let me just say that because I
know I've had a lot of issues especially
my November favorites people hated it
so just keep in mind the glass makes
them look a little bit bigger and the
lipliner everything with a highlight it
all comes together but I love this color
combo I'll have all the colors listed
down below it's absolutely beautiful and
the perfect light nude which I haven't
done in forever so after that you're
done with the whole look I hope you guys
enjoyed it please give it a thumbs up if
you did like it and don't forget to
subscribe and I will see you all in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
