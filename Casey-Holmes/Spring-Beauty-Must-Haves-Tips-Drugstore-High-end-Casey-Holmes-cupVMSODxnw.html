couple days what was that ha ha ha
oh my god I just like literally it was
embarrassing do you know what that was
yes yeah you know what sucks is I have
ran out of so many products recently
that I have not been saving them like I
usually do a products that I used up
video and I haven't been saving them and
I feel like I've ran out of so many
products at once makeup skincare hair
everything it's all gone hey guys so
today's video I'm gonna be sharing with
you some of my spring beauty must-have
so we were talking all about makeup
today you know fashion and nothing it is
all going to be makeup products that I
recommend for spring coming up since it
is getting warmer especially here in
Georgia it is getting a pretty warm I've
already switched out my winter clothes
for my spring clothes and that was a
task within itself I think we're all
pretty excited about spring and summer
right like we're over this cold so let's
just go ahead and get started with this
video ok first we're gonna start off
with Beltane errs now I just got a new
shipment in today and I'm so excited
this is the self-tanner I have been
using for a while now like a few months
I would say I really really love it it
is loving tan and they are based out in
Australia and I believe that they now
have their shipping to America America I
believe that they're shipping to the US
now is a lot cheaper than it was because
when I ordered it was like $20 see they
fixed that and I think they are on their
a-game and everyone to wait to mention
them till they got their shipping the
situation under control because it's
just expensive so anyway this is a
self-tanner I'm using so this is the
loving tan deluxe bronzing mousse in
ultra dark I've only used the ultra dark
one and when it says ultra dark it means
like hello you went to the Bahamas not
really when you're just sitting at home
eating pizza and you came back and you
have this gorgeous bronze olive tan I
mean oh my god it's beautiful so this is
the one that I use this
the one that I use when I have enough
time in a day to apply this but the one
that I really really really love is the
two hour Express and this is the first
self-tanner I've ever tried like this
that I really love that like works
instantly yesterday was actually st.
Patrick's Day and I put this on right
before I went out and I was super tan
and I was just like yes it looks really
good
and it doesn't look like you know your
self tanning at the moment it just looks
like you're really nice and tan so this
is a two hour Express deluxe bronzing
mousse in the dark like I said I love
these both but if you're kind of in a
rush and need a tan really quickly like
if you're doing it in the morning or
something definitely get it to our
Express it's amazing but if you have
more time on your hands and definitely
get the deluxe bronzing mousse both of
them are amazing and both of them are
super dark so love love love loving tan
then for just like a temporary bronzer I
have been obsessed with this product it
is the Laura tantalizer at body bronzing
spray and I've actually had this forever
you guys like forever when I moved I
rediscovered it and I was like where
have you been I mean I'm not seeing you
ever so what I really love this product
for is what I'm trying to really exploit
in my skin and not self tan because this
self tanner is quite hard to get off I
will say that it takes me a little bit
like a week to get this off I'm not even
kidding so while I'm in transition of
trying to get that self tear off so I
can reapply I will use this and what
I'll do is I'll just spray my chest or
whatever areas are gonna be showing on
my body and sure you let it dry before
you could put your clothes on because
otherwise it will get all over them when
you use this all you want to do is just
spray it on evenly it also comes with a
puff which is great because when I get
to my hands I really need to buff in
that product and the puff works really
really well I don't have it on me right
now it's in my bathroom but if you get
this product you'll get that in there
and it's just I recommend keeping it for
times where you think that it looks a
little streaky if you just buff it in
and it looks beautiful
but it's just a nice a noice honestly
and makes your skin look flawless it's
like makeup for your chest and
everything I just I love this and if
you're just trying to have like a one
night tan this is the way to go okay
moving on to fun stuff which is makeup
products I have a quite a bit to show
you so
we're just may get started let's start
with how you apply it to your face so
the first thing I want to recommend it
is a primer now I have really oily skin
so I'm focused on having a more matte
face during the spring and summertime
and if I want to glow I'll just add a
highlight so I love Matt primers I don't
have my other one on me which is
drugstore it is the number seven primer
from Boots you can get it from Target
it's so great at keeping you mattes and
I love that but my dog's got ahold of it
and it was dead after that also for a
high end I love these Smashbox a fotomat
anti-shine primer now that I think about
it I don't think that this is in stock
anymore like I don't think they sell it
anymore which is actually really
depressing so if you can find this
definitely pick it up I just like
remember it off the top of my head they
probably don't have it but if all else
fails go by Target get the boots number
seven one and you will love it now when
you use that boots number seven primer
you really want to press it into your
skin you don't want to like rub it all
over because then it starts getting a
little bit flaky and you're gonna get
these little white specks everywhere
just really press it into areas that
you're super oily if you're not oily in
one area then avoid that because it will
claim to dry patches and it will just
make everything look a hot mess so put
it where you have really really oily
areas which for me is right here right
here right here right here
this whole t-zone is a hot mess so next
up we're gonna talk about foundation and
the first one you guys are gonna be like
we already know okay see it's amazing
but I have to mention it is the Estee
Lauder Double Wear foundation I love
this foundation especially for the
warmer months it's a nice full coverage
foundation and it really just makes
everything look flawless and if I need
something that I'm like okay I need to
have a really long wearing foundation
for a really long period of time what do
I need to use this is it this is my
go-to foundation no matter what so I
love it and love it I've gone through at
least three bottles of this and it's
just my favorite foundation ever so
highly recommend Estee Lauder nowhere
perfection and then from the drugstore
I'm obsessed with this one it is the
L'Oreal Paris infallible Pro matte
foundation I'm wearing this right now
and I'm wearing the color Sun beige and
it's really really nice but this does
Drive fairly quickly so you
wanna make sure you really buff it in
and what I like to do is I like to use
this a makeup peek foundation brush is
the face of buffer brush it's dirty
because I just used it today but this is
like my new favorite foundation brush of
life it is the best thing I've ever used
for foundation I even think I like it
more than the Beauty Blender like it's
that good it just really blends
everything into the skin and makes it
all sink in and just look flawless the
foundation brush it's a sigma f80 who is
that anymore I don't even know okay so
then after that I'm not gonna do
concealer because I recommend that Pro
Longwear which I talk about all the time
so for powders this one is the one that
I recommend the most I buy a lot of
high-end powders will not really I've
purchased a lot of high-end powders
throughout the years and even now I just
find myself going to my drugstore ones
and this one is one of my favorites it's
the wet and wild cover all pressed
powder and this is in the shade medium I
also love my stuff of the face with that
I also love the wet Wild Fergie
translucent mattifying powder that's
actually in my clutch from last night
because I took it out with me but I love
the wet and wild powders I think they're
great and I think they're really awesome
at keeping you max feel like if these
just do the same thing as a high-end
powder I really really love them and I
actually feel like these wet wild
powders keep me matte for a lot longer
than the high end powders that I have so
next up is bronzer and I'm bronzer
hoarder I have a lot of browsers that I
love but these two are my current
favorites and I'm about to show you so
this one is from the drugstore is the
essence Sun Club brunette darker skin
matte bronzing powder but it is in the
color 0 to sunny this one is not that
dark I do have it on today just on like
the high points of my face but I love
this it is a completely matte bronzer
and it is more on the warm side which I
personally love for an all-over face
bronzer as long as it's matte I just
love it and then for high-end oh my gosh
this bronzer is so good it is expensive
but it's amazing if the girl on
terracotta bronzer and it is in the
color number zero 5 this is a terracotta
bronzer so it is very very very
very warm well make you look orange if
you are not careful but I oh my gosh I
just adore this bronzer so much if you
want to look really nice and bronzed and
just like beautiful you came back from
the beach this is the product for you I
love it and I feel like this is gonna
last me forever because I've used it
quite a bit and all you have to do is
dip your bronzer brush in it like just
tap it in there tap off any excess and
then put on your face and you're good to
go like the littlest amount of product
is all you need and since it is so warm
you really want to make sure you don't
go in with too much at first you want to
really just build this up if you have to
but I find that when I dip my brush in
it and tap off the excess that's enough
for me and I'll just go ahead and brown
the skin with it okay for blush I want
to talk about two blushes as well I have
a lot of things that are just twos
because I don't know I kind of just
wanted to narrow everything down so the
first thing is this NYX bronzer is the
baked blush it's a illuminator and
bronzer in one this one's my favorite
NYX baked blush and it is in the color
ignite and I I just I love it
it's a peachy bronze shade and it has
like a golden sheen to it oh my gosh it
is beautiful I love this color that is
it right there now you really can't see
it very well but once you put on your
cheeks it looks absolutely it's stunning
so that is it right there I just I love
it in a little bit does go a long way
and if you don't want to have a
highlighter for the day you can just
apply this blush you'll be our
highlighter and blush in one so I love
this color this colors my favorite and
then for high-end this Tarte blush and
captivating is absolutely beautiful I
use this last year and I just adore
Tarte blushes are really great too
because they last a really long time and
this is a matte shade so this is more of
a peachy pink color and to me I think it
looks good on so many different skin
tones it looks good on really tan skin
tones looks good on fair skin tones I've
seen a lot of people rock this color so
love this again this is in the shade
captivating from okay so for brows I
know you guys have seen me use this
product a lot but I really
truly love it like it's my favorite brow
product ever right now at the moment
that it that I've tried - my Mac
fluidline that one's really great - but
this one is just so good for the price
and then the Zee NYX eyebrow gel is
waterproof and in the shade chocolate
this is just so good it lasts such a
long time the price point is fantastic
of course from the drugstore and you
need the littlest amount of this stuff
to do your brows and I love it I have it
on my brows today I've had I've been
using this for a while now
I don't it's been quite a few months I
haven't really switched it up so I I
love this so so much I feel like it's
kind of foolproof um it's just so easy
to work with like I never overdo my
brows moving on to eye shadows I just
want to say bold colors are gonna be my
thing they were last year and they're
gonna be again whenever I use bold eye
shadows I usually like to smoke out the
lower lash line with it like I did today
I have this purple lower lash line which
is kind of worn off because I've been
wearing this makeup for a few hours but
make no Peaks the way to go if you want
to do affordable eyeshadows I know I
mentioned them all the time but it's
because the price point is like six
books one more person touched me I swear
to goodness gracious so I love makeup
geek eyeshadows if you don't if you
don't see yourself like wearing a blue
eyeshadow all the time that I would
recommend make a peak because there are
only six bucks apiece and the quality is
high in quality like it's amazing so my
favorite colors and then I'll be using I
swear - favorite shades that I will be
rocking I'm actually wearing this one
right now in my lower lashline this is
in the shade with stereo or wisteria I'm
sorry that's what it looks like right
there it's a really pretty light a
pastel purple just so beautiful on the
eyes like I love this color like look at
that stun you I'm telling you
make up Peaks the way to go like why
even purchase high in i shudders anymore
oh I love that color every time I look
at this palette this is the color that
I'm just like yes I'm so excited to use
you this is in the shade and Neptune
it's coming off more purple on camera
it's definitely a cobalt blue color oh
my gosh look at that that's so stunning
it is a cobalt blue like I said it's
coming off so purple on camera so
stunning that's what it looks like right
there and then one more that I want to
mention to you is pull sides so pretty
it definitely reminds me of the beach
and being at a pool and it's just oh my
gosh stunning look at that that's
gorgeous
so absolutely absolutely love these
these three are probably going to be my
top three that I smoke out I'm gonna
find lower lashlines okay I also want to
mention colored mascara and I actually
am wearing this one right now this is in
the shade pink perfect and you can't
really see it I don't think on camera
but I have this on my lower lashes and
it really just ants up the purple that I
have smoked out and the key to these is
to apply it let it dry then apply
another coat if you want it to be more
subtle then I would just do one coat but
if you want to be more dramatic and
people to really see the color then just
let it dry and keep building it up to
however much you won't run your lashes
and you'll really be able to see the
color so make sure you just let it dry
and then build up from there so I have
the color pink perfect and also coral
reef and I'm so excited oh I'm so
excited to wear it coral reef - it just
looks so studying and I also want to
mention highlighters hmm this first one
is like the prettiest highlighter I've
ever seen in my life this is the Josie
Maran Argan illuminizer
main reasons why I love this is I can
use this before I put on a powder
highlighter to really make the
highlighter last all day long or I could
just use it by itself you can mix this
in with your foundation if you like a
really really glowy look I'm not
personally into that because I'm already
oily but if you wanted to you told so
they can and it's just a gorgeous
champagne gold highlighter and it just
blends out so well and I think that I
shadow in it
it really blends out so well you can see
right there oh my gosh with a tan that
is going to be stunning and then for
powder highlighter this one's been my
favorite highlighter of the
I actually other than that one I haven't
been using anything else powder
highlighter wise and this is the Mac
mineralized skinfinish in a perfect
topping when you look at this you kind
of think how is that gonna highlight my
face that's a bunch of different colors
in it and it just doesn't look like a
good highlighter this is probably one of
the prettiest powder highlighters I've
ever used in my life and I've just been
really enjoying it so this is what it
looks like and it's not like your
regular highlighters where it's like
where it has a lot of shimmer and it's
gonna give you that really shimmery look
on the top of your cheekbones or it's
kind of noticeable you put a highlighter
on this is one of those glowy subtle
highlighters it's not so subtle that you
can't even tell you have it on but it
has a little bit of shimmer in there to
give you that really pretty pop on the
top of the cheekbone and it's just oh
you have to trust me when I say it's the
best hey look like I'm about to break
the packaging hahaha screw that dude I
does the best highlighter of life if you
want more of a glowy look I'm telling
you this is stunning
like the swatch does it doesn't even do
it any justice and then I really quickly
want to mention some Olympic colors and
first thing is these ultimatte lip
creams I adore these I did a whole video
on them I did swatches and this short
review so if you want to check that out
I will link it to down below but I love
these the colors that I recommend for
spring are tinder don't confuse the
other gender artistic spirited lively
and vivid and also too if you buy colors
like this but you think they're a little
too bold for you you could buy like the
nude such as tinder and you can mix and
match with these shades so if you feel
like lively is a little too bold for you
you could put this down and then put
tinder on top and just mix it together
and it will just kind of tone down the
color make it a little more subtle and
then also if you don't want to do like a
really super bold lip if you're like me
personally don't like to wear hot pink
lips that's just it's just not my thing
I don't I just don't like it my thing is
if I'm gonna go with a bold color like
that like pinks or something I like to
do it in a lip gloss form I know I
actually have this one on this is the
mac viva glam Nikki and it's a really
bold pink like it's a really really pink
lip gloss but I paired it over my Too
Faced melted
new lipstick and it just gives the
perfect combo it still looks bright and
springy but it's not like BAM in your
face
hot pink lips you know what I mean if
you like hot pink lips rock it I have
nothing against it but for me personally
I just don't like them on me other ones
I really love these maybelline color
elixirs are stunning if you have not
checked them out already where have you
been and you need to stop and go get
them this one's gorgeous this is in the
shade luminous lilac oh my god
see how it's brief it's it's pretty and
it's spring but it's subtle so I love
that and then also I don't know what
these are called but they're I'll Oriel
this gloss is in the color coral arm
core oh wait till you see this color
you're gonna be running out to get it
like right now look at that and like you
don't even need a lipstick with these
you could just talk you could just use
the gloss and be good to go if you do
want to go with more of a pop of color
on the lips I love this color this is u2
face and melted lipstick and it's the
longer liquid lipstick in melted
strawberry stop it gosh I'm so sorry
about this swatch
it's the worst swatch of life that is
the melted strawberry and it is just so
pretty it's bright I just got this on my
shirt cool cool so this one this one is
perfect because it's bright but it's not
too brightly too pink to purple to red
it's honestly like that perfect summer
spring colors okay so the last thing I
want to talk about is actually the
moisturizer that I use I know this
doesn't make up but it's key to my
makeup process because it helps keep me
matte all day I've actually used this
for about two years now I actually
started using this on my first story of
my channel and then I kind of forgot
about it after I'd use it all up and
then I'm using it for now probably about
a year again so this stuff for when the
warmer months come out I'd use it all
year round like I used it during the
winter time but I really really love
this for these summer time so this is
what it looks like it says it's an oil
control and modifiers you can use a
mattifying primer all you want to but if
you use a super hydrating moisturizer
sometimes they just don't it just it
makes things worse sometimes so starting
off with like an OCO mio fire like
this and then putting a mattifying
primer on top is really gonna help
keeping that a lot longer it's really
gonna work better for your skins
absolutely love this if you're very very
oily I would definitely check this out
okay guys so if that is it for this
spring a must have the video I really
hope you guys enjoyed it a lot of
products were talked about and I am
definitely loving a lot of drugstore
stuff lately so but thank you guys again
so much for watching and I'll see you in
just a couple of days bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
