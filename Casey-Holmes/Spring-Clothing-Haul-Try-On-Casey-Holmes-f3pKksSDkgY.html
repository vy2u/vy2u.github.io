a spring clothing haul I feel like I
haven't done a clothing haul in a while
I feel like it's been a really long time
so I figured I would share with you guys
a couple things that I picked up
recently I hope you're excited I'm ready
to wear these I haven't worn any of
these items because I've been waiting to
do this whole and waiting for warmer
weather to come around because it's been
fluctuating lately is it like that for
anybody else it's like really hot then
really cold I don't know what's going on
but if it could get a little bit hotter
that'd be great also I just want to say
this look is from the Alaric Pro mega 2
palette I was going to do a tutorial but
they don't have this in stock anymore so
I didn't know if it was something you
guys would be interested in since you
can't get it anymore
but this is what I used for my eyes
today and I really like it so if you do
want to see a tutorial let me know but
if not I totally understand since you
can't get that anymore but I'm going to
go ahead and get started with this haul
the first thing I got right here is from
whitefox boutique I love white fox all
these like Australian clothing boutiques
always have the cutest stuff and white
fox is definitely one of them if you've
been watching me for a while I've been
ordering from them for like years now so
the first thing is this army green dress
and it just looks like this and it goes
all the way down I will try this stuff
on for you guys this is a really nice
thick fabric the only thing I will say
is I got a size small which fit fine and
my waist and everything but in my boobs
it's a little too tight so if you have a
bigger chest I would definitely go up a
size and then this is adorable this is
also from whitefox boutique it's a
strapless top it has a sweetheart
neckline and it is off the shoulder and
it is cropped this is adorable and I
think this is just to die for
I mean how it's even cute not on the
body I love it so again that one's from
whitefox boutique as well as these next
few items this one I sadly cannot wear
because it just does not fit over my
boobs I don't know what the heck is
going on with my boobs lately but I feel
like they've gotten bigger and I wish
they would stop because I don't I don't
want my boobs to get any bigger this is
a really adorable strapless white top
I'm going to insert the picture on the
model but the part I love about it the
most is the back is kind of open so if
you're wearing like high-waisted jeans
or low
two genes it's so cute to have like that
little lower back peek out okay the next
few t-shirts are from white box boutique
as well and I like them they have like
little things on them which i think is
just adorable I'm a t-shirt kind of
person all day every day I love to be in
a t-shirt and leggings that's just my
life but this says Mohito margarita
Cosmo pina colada and martini and you
can see I've already been wearing it
love the fact that they have the rolled
up sleeves I think that's such a nice
touch and then they also have this one
that says Coco Valentino mark Alexander
and Herve girl I don't know this one is
one of my favorites because obviously I
do YouTube I have them for a while and
it says YouTube is my Bible I love the
font of this and I just I love
everything about it this is a small
medium as well by the way and then this
one pretty much describes my life and it
says when in doubt to wing it out so I
love my life I always bring out my
eyeliner so love this all of those again
were from whitefox boutique I also got a
really pretty sequined dress there I
think they still have it on their side
insert picture right here you guys went
crazy over it and you loved it and they
have a bunch of different styles of that
dress on the site so definitely go check
them out and then I also got this top
from Free People this is a really
adorable off the shoulder top I just
love this I think this is so summery and
cute and just looks like this and then
the back is kind of open so again with
like high-waisted shorts this would be
adorable
then the next thing I got this from
revolve clothing and this is more modest
but it's really lightweight and I feel
like this would be good to wear to West
Point whenever a Davis graduates like
just one of the day dresses that I'll
wear but it looks like this I guess what
is this called like a paisley print but
it cinches in here at the waist and then
it just goes down like this I thought
this with some really nice sandals like
my little brown Tory Burch ones would be
really cute and it's very lightweight so
I like that I do not like this where's
the but I do not like this buttoned up
right here I feel like it's too modest
for me so once I unbuttoned it I really
like the way that it looked and it's a
nice casual dress and then I
get this two-piece set from free people
and I love two-piece sets I think
there's so much fun so this is the
bottom oh so cute so cute for the beach
those are just gonna look adorable and
this is the top it's just that same
pattern but cropped I love the straps on
these two they're like so thick and then
the next item I got from Free People I
wore this in my travel vacation outfits
or was like my favorite vacation outfits
from Punta Cana and I have this in the
gray one and I loved it so much that I
had to get this blue one because I loved
the colors of this blue dress so this is
what it looks like just has flowers down
the side and then it does have this
detail right here with the strings so it
just ties up I love this it's a high-low
it is so comfortable and I think it's
just adorable I love that and this I
also got from revolve clothing again I
thought this would be a great day dress
or something to wear at the beach and
this is from the brand Meek pink it's a
really vibrant dress but I love it oh
it's so cute just so cute I even think
like for an Auburn game this orange
would be perfect even though like the
flowers are mint I just think the orange
would just be awesome and I just got lip
gloss over it awesome
okay the last three things that I got
are from BCBG and I love these pants I'm
so obsessed with like the flowy pants
kind of like 70s vibe jumpsuit I'm
wearing has flared bottoms and I love it
this is from Lulu's by the way but look
at how adorable these pants are I feel
like with a white crop top oh my gosh I
love them again from BCBG and they're
just adorable they do have like the
elastic part in the back and then the
solid front these are so comfy and I
just Hank over them I think they're the
cutest things in the world they had
multiple kinds too but I liked that
pattern best and then this top is so
flattering on I didn't try it on so I
was just taking a risk but I absolutely
loved it I will probably take this up
when I go up as well it's just a little
tank top that looks like this and it has
longer sides and it's a
hello and it also has this open back
here it's kind of like a peekaboo for
your lower back I really love it
this is such a nice shirt and it's
really really soft I used to shop at
BCBG all the time but lately I've been
just wanting more like kind of bohemian
style stuff but they still have some
really cute things so these three items
I just fell in love with and had to have
them and then this one was like I was so
excited I had this because they had it
in the back they didn't have it out
front but it's just a plain tank top in
the front and it has longer sides again
but then in the back it has this chain
detail which I thought was so sexy and
it also has a built-in bra right here as
well so you don't even have to wear a
bra with it and I just love this I think
it is so adorable you can wear this with
high-waisted jeans or just regular low
waisted jeans whatever you want and I
feel like it would look sexy either way
it's just so cute I absolutely love that
okay guys so that is it for the spring
clothing haul it wasn't a huge one like
I usually do but I'm trying not to buy
as many clothes because if you follow me
on snapchat you know I just did a
massive spring cleaning I got rid of
bags and bags of clothes that I knew I
would not wear and I still have a lot of
stuff to go through but I fell in love
with these items and I think for the
special occasions and events and
vacations I have coming up they're going
to be perfect yeah let me know down
below what your favorite site is I asked
you guys on snapchat what your favorite
clothing site was and you guys like told
me so many amazing ones so if you have
any other ones let me know down below in
the comments and don't forget to give
this video a thumbs up if you liked it
