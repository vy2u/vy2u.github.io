a spring makeup look this is a really
easy simple makeup look that you can do
since springtime is hopefully around the
corner I did use my Sigma warm neutrals
palette I did a smokey eye with this
palette I think about a month ago I'll
leave it down below in the description
box if you want check it out but I had a
ton of requests to do a lighter look
with this and I figured this was a
perfect time to do it this is a really
simple look to recreate just
highlighting bronzing and just a really
light eyeshadow look so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you do like it
please give it a thumbs up and I will
see you guys in my next one bye
okay so getting started I'm going to
take this color in the Sigma shadow
palette with a e55 brush and I'm just
going to apply this all over my lid this
has to be one of my favorite shades and
I use it pretty often just a gorgeous
champagne gold color and I think it
looks beautiful with this look and it
really brightens up the eyes
next we're taking this color in the
palette with a sigma e40 and this is
going to be our transition shade so I'm
going to be applying this eyeshadow and
the crease just to create some more
definition
now I'm taking my estee lauder double
wear foundation in three w1 Thani and my
Sigma f40 and I'm just going to apply
this all over my face my skin's been
getting really really red lately so I
don't know what's going on but hopefully
I can hit it to die down pretty soon
after that we're going to take our
concealer this is the mac prolongwear
concealer in nw20 and I'm just going to
apply this underneath my eyes I'm also
going to highlight with this in the
center of my face as well
going to blend out the center of my face
with my Sigma f80 and then for the other
eyes I'll be using my Sigma f80 six
next I'm going to be setting my makeup
I'll be using the makeup forever super
matte loose powder underneath my eyes
and then the benefit Porefessional
powder I think that's what it's called
or anti shine I'm not sure I'll be using
that for my face makeup and then for
bronzer I'm gonna be using my NYC
bronzer in Montauk bronze this is one of
my favorite bronzers ever and I'm using
my Real Techniques brush I'm going to
just be applying this kind of on my
cheekbones underneath my jaw on the top
of my forehead I just want a really nice
bronzed look with this I'm not going to
be contouring today I'm just going to be
bronzing it up taking this Milani
Luminoso blush this is so beautiful
especially for spring and summertime
going to be applying this to my cheeks
and then after I've applied it I'm going
to be blending this out with the duo
fiber brush
using my dior highlighter in amber
diamond I'm just going to be using this
to highlight my face
ticking my Tarte Amazonian clay eyebrow
mousse in taupe I'm just going to be
filling in my brows
and then to set them in place and when
we take in the Anasazi a clear brow gel
with this mac liner in costa reach i'm
just going to line my upper lash line
and you don't have to be perfect with
this because we are gonna smudge it out
I really like this liner it's not too
Brown it's like a red brown color and I
really like it with this look we're just
going to take this pencil brush after
we've applied that and then just smudge
out that liner
and then I'm also going to line my upper
waterline with this for my lower
waterline I'm going to take the Rimmel
scandaleyes eyeliner in nude and this is
going to really brighten up your eyes if
you ever want to make your eyes look a
little bit bigger take a nude eyeliner
and just apply to your waterline going
back in with that dew or highlighter I'm
going to take the lightest shades in it
and I'm just going to apply this to my
tear duct area and again this will also
brighten up your eyes as well taking the
transition shade that we used earlier
I'm going to take it with a pencil brush
and apply this underneath my lower lash
line just to add some extra dimension
curling our lashes and then I'm going to
be applying my favorite mascara the Too
Faced - better than sex mascara I'm not
using lashes this is definitely my
favorite mascara to use just because it
makes my lashes look super super thick
and I've just been really loving it so I
would definitely recommend this mascara
if you're looking for a new one to try
out and then for bottom lashes I'm
taking the Clinique bottom lash mascara
and applying that to those lower lashes
for lips I'm going to be taking quite a
few products I'm taking the Rimmel lip
liner in nude and I'm just going to go
ahead and line my lips with this and
then for lipstick I'm taking milania's
Flamingo pose first I'm just going to
lightly dab this on my lips to give my
lips more of it pink shade to them then
taking nude cream from Milani I'm going
to apply this all over the lips as well
and then topping it off with a lip gloss
taking the whitening lightening nude lip
gloss and just finishing it off so I
hope you guys enjoyed this look thank
you so much for watching and I will see
you guys in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
