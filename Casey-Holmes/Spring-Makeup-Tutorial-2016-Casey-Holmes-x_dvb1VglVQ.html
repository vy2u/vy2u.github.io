spring makeup tutorial and I wanted to
do something fun with a little bit of
color and I felt like I had to just dip
into the peanut butter and jelly palette
from Too Faced I mentioned this and my
favorite hits and miss it and I figured
I would show you guys how I where'd this
palette just something fun and easy to
do I feel like anyone can do this look
because it was really easy I think the
different colors kind of makes it look a
little more technical but it's not that
bad I promise and I also used a new
highlighting product which and I'm
really really bronzed and I'm super
bronze my foundation was a little too
light for me so I like just bronze up
the skin so just went with the whole tan
glowy just bronzed spring/summer looks
so I hope you guys enjoyed this makeup
look if you do like it don't forget to
give it a thumbs up and leave a comment
down below letting me know what you want
to see next and if you want to see how
to get this makeup look then let's just
go ahead and get started okay so the
first thing we're going to do is put
tape on the side of our eye you guys
know I love to do this and we're going
to go ahead and take that palette and
take the color peanut butter which is
one of my favorite transition shades and
I'm going to put this a little bit above
the crease and also into the crease and
I'm just going to make sure that I blend
this out really really well I want it to
look really airbrush and buffed out I
don't want any harsh lines while doing
this so just really take your time it
took me probably like a minute and a
half two minutes to blend out how I
wanted but blending takes time and it
takes effort but you'll get it if you
just keep on blending then I'm going to
go ahead and take nuts about you which
is a gorgeous orange color I'm going to
take a smaller blending brush and
focuses on the outer V and a little bit
into the crease as well I want to focus
all of this matte shade on the outer V
you could take it in a little bit to the
inner part of your lid like about
halfway but we're also going to put a
different color in that area as well but
a little bit in the crease mostly on the
outer V I love this thing oh my god you
guys have to go get it like perfect I
love it I use it so much for switching
my colors and I'm gonna go ahead and fix
plus my brush and take that shade I
forget what it's called but I'll leave
it down below
and I'm going to pack that color onto my
lid it's a gorgeous shimmery orange
color which I think complements the
matte orange so well it really gives it
an extra pop by the way sorry about my
phone then I'm going to go on with this
one I here I think it's called banana
it's a gorgeous gold and I'm going to
pop this into the inner corner blend it
into that sparkly orange and just put it
around that tear duct area this will
really brighten up the look and this
kind of looks like a sunset kind of eye
I don't know I really like it and I
think it looks really pretty and bright
for spring then I'm just going to blend
again I'm taking that brush I didn't put
any extra product on it I'm just running
it over the edges of everything and then
using my makeup forever ink liner to
give me a nice black winged liner
for falsies you're probably not
surprised I'm using the velour fluffin
wispies I'm just in love with these and
then I'm going to go ahead and move on
the face I'm going to take the benefit
mat rescue I love this stuff I mean it's
just one of my favorite products as well
as this one which is the Smashbox primer
water and then a new love is my soap &amp;amp;
Glory blotting primer I'll put all the
names of everything down below I also
adore the foundation I tried out in my
first impressions video from soap &amp;amp;
Glory it is beautiful it really
minimizes the look of your pores and I
don't say that very often because I do
have larger pores so it's really hard to
find something that doesn't accentuate
them but this one does minimize them and
it blends out so well and it does stay
for such a long time I know the colors a
little light for me and this concealer I
know is too light I need to go buy a
darker one I ran out of it but we will
bronze will make it work my chest was
really red today so it was hard to match
my foundation just forgive me I know
it's a little off a little more olive
but I mean just please forgive me now
i'm taking this nyx HD powder in banana
which is really great at setting the
under-eye so i'm just going to go ahead
and set the under-eye and the rest of
the places that i put concealer to
bronze my face and give me a gorgeous
tan look i'm going to take the mac
mineralize skinfinish and give me Sun I
like this one because it has more of a
warm undertone to it so it's really
great to try to match my face to my body
because my body is a little bit more
warm around my neck area you can see
right there on my necklace is it's
really red but my shoulders aren't that
red so it's just kind of hard to figure
them out and then I'm taking my benefit
hoola bronzer with the benefit brush and
I'm just contouring doing something kind
of like a light contour nothing too
crazy then I'm taking this Shea Moisture
blush and this is the peachy coral this
is absolutely beautiful it does smell
like play-doh but it is a beautiful
peachy coral color and it blends out
really well I got this out Ulta if you
haven't checked out my haul and I just
really really love it it's so stunning
especially with this look moving on to
my next favorite thing that I got from
Sephora you know I had
ten points visit the Anasazi a globe kit
I forget which one it is but I'll leave
it down below it's more of the golden
one and I'm taking this shade right here
and I'm going to highlight with it this
is my first time using it as you can
tell by my facial expressions I love
this palette when I was watching it I
was scared that the highlighter is gonna
be a little too dark but no they are
absolutely stunning and they just make
you glow and you just highlight all over
the place it's amazing so if you've been
eyeing it like I have I would definitely
recommend it it is such a good product
and I love that you have four
highlighters in one as well so then
filling in my brows I'm taking the
Ardell medium brown brow pomade and then
we're going back into the palette and
highlighting with the matte cream shade
in the palette and I like that it's
matte because we do have a lot of
shimmer going on on our eyes so I do
want to keep that area matte and I focus
most of the cream shade right at the
arch of the brow just to really lift it
then I'm taking this make a peak liner I
was taking the lighter purple but it
wasn't showing up as well on my
waterline so the one I'm using right now
is royal and putting it on my waterline
in a little bit below my lower lash line
so this is what it looks like I think
these are new I got them in PR but then
I'm going to take this color in the
palette which is the purple and a pencil
brush and smudge this underneath that
lower lash line to give that gorgeous
purple pop I love this purple in here
it's absolutely stunning it's just oh I
can't this palette is so cute I can't
with it then I'm going to apply mascara
to my bottom lashes this is the benefit
roller lash you guys know I obsess over
this and then for lip liner another
obsession of the Urban Decay Gwen
Stefani
ex-girlfriend lip liner and then this
lorac X exposition I for it was a skull
I'll leave it down below this is a great
warm nude and I topped it off with the
buxom peachy decorate no like peach
daiquiri I need to get it together
pick this peach daiquiri and then you
are officially done so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video don't forget to give
it a thumbs up and subscribe and I will
see you all in my next one bye guys oh
okay so looking at myself right now this
inner corner I'm looking in the
viewfinder to kind of show you guys

bright in a</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
