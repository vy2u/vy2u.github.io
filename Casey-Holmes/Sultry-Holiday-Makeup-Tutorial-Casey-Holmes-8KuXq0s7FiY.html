showing you how to get this makeup look
I was actually looking at my makeup geek
eyeshadows and I saw that I paired these
three together and I was like that would
be so pretty
depend on balls so that's exactly what I
did today it's a little bit of gray a
little bit of purple Burgundy's and I
just love the way that this look turned
out I think it's so pretty it's very
smoky it's very sexy I think this look
is perfect for the holidays just because
it's an all matte look ball lashes and
of course you could do the lip however
you want it to and I think it's fun for
New Year's and just holiday parties and
everything like that so I really hope
you guys enjoyed this video don't forget
to give it a thumbs up if you like this
look and also I am doing vlogmas this
year which is so crazy but I am vlogging
every single day till Christmas so if
you want to check that out I will leave
my vlog channel down below so don't
forget to subscribe to that as well if
you're interested and yeah if you guys
want to see how I got this makeup look
then let's just get started okay so the
first color I'm going to take is the
color Mirage and this is just a nice
creamy yellow color and I'm just using
this all over my lid to even out my skin
and then I'm going to go in with creme
brulee and I'm going to put this into
the crease as our transition shade I
always use a transition shade and creme
brulee is one of my favorites so I
definitely recommend picking it up for
any look
then I'm going in with vintage and I'm
going to just put this in the outer half
and all the way in towards the center of
my lid and it's okay if this looks a
little messy but you do want to build it
up because you want to make sure you can
see this color so I am gonna go in a
couple times and just build this color
up but like I said you want to take it
half way onto your lid
now we're gonna take the shade cherry
cola I absolutely adore this color it is
so beautiful I'm just gonna put this in
the very outer V just to deepen it up a
little bit more and I love the colors of
like the purple and the burgundy and
then this grey oh my gosh they're just
oh I cannot tell you enough how happy I
was at this look but I'm gonna blend it
up towards the crease a little bit and
just mainly focus it in like a triangle
shape on the outer half of my eye then
I'm gonna take creme brulee and go in
and blend out the edges of this eye
shadow and kind of blend on my lid as
well and then I'll go back in and touch
up those colors once again it's all
about blending and the reason why we
took that one shade into the center of
our eye because it's gonna help the gray
blend really pretty and kind of do an
ombre ish effect and now I'm gonna take
bedrock oh I like that name I don't know
whose the name of it I'm gonna put this
all over my lid but I'm gonna avoid
going in the very outer corner so I'm
going to go about half way as well with
this color very very pigmented very
beautiful and then I'm gonna go back in
with vintage and I'm going to touch up
the purple on the lid and blend it into
bedrock just so like I said it really
blends beautifully
and then I am also touching up cherry
cola as well
then I'm gonna take my makeup forever
ink eyeliner and I'm going to do a
winged eyeliner then I'm taking my
favorite lashes at the moment I forget
the name of these but they're like the
fluffin whispies from the lore you guys
I literally can't I also cannot with
this foundation because I'm obsessed you
guys this is my new love I love this
foundation from Marc Jacobs a little
goes a long way it's full coverage and
it makes your skin look absolutely
flawless I haven't heard anyone talk
about it but I'm I'm so happy with this
foundation like I have a new love so I'm
just taking a makeup geek face buffer
brush and blending this in this brush
has been one of my favorites as well for
blending foundation on my face then I'm
gonna take the Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer and I'm just going to put this
underneath my eyes and the center of my
face like I normally do just to
highlight and cover up some of these
dark circles that we got
then we're going to set everything with
this Marc Jacobs palette link is the
Mirage palette and I'm going to take the
yellow tone powder and just put this on
top of all that concealer that we put on
then it's time to bronze I'm gonna take
this hourglass ambient lighting powder I
believe but this is in bronze radiant
bronze light I'll have all the details
to have below in the description box I'm
just going to bronze with this it gives
you really pretty bronze glow then I'm
going to go in with my favorite contour
shade which is the benefit hoola you can
see I've put a dent in this I absolutely
love it one of the best contour powders
ever it blends really beautifully and it
has just the right amount of Ashley
tones in it to make it look like a
shadow but it's not too gray where it
looks dead and it's not too warm to
where it looks obvious that you have a
contour then I'm gonna take this powder
from Sigma I love this for a blush it's
absolutely beautiful it's just so nice
and it blends really really well
and then for highlighters I wanted to
show you guys a couple different options
that you could choose from benefit the
first one that I'm actually gonna use on
my face today is the Watts up
highlighter you guys know I love this
I've been using it for like a little
over a month now and it's just one of my
favorites it just gives a perfect golden
glow and it's a cream to powder product
so you don't have to set this a powder
at all if you have oily skin don't be
scared of it because it's not going
anywhere it will stay on your face all
day long and be nice and bright and very
pigmented so I absolutely love this
here's a little swatch of it right here
then the next one I'm going to show you
is Girl Meets pearl this one's a soft
liquid pink and it's a liquid
highlighter for more of a dewy glow so
it's a little bit more sheer and then
you have the high beam and Sun beam the
Sun beam is great for summer because it
gives a golden bronze highlight and it's
just stunning you could even mix that
with your foundation and then high-beam
as you can tell is a pink liquid
highlighter so just depending on what
you want they have something for you I
absolutely love benefits highlighters I
think they're amazing so now I'm gonna
fill in my brows with the anastasia
dipbrow and then i lined my eyes with a
coal liner just the one from NARS and
then I'm taking that burgundy shade and
pushing this up against my lower lash
line just threw smoke at this look out
then I'm taking that more purple shade
and I'm just going to blend out with
this and these two together when they're
blended together it's just they're so
pretty I love them so much
I'm gonna take this opal highlighter
from background I'm just gonna put this
underneath my brows and in the inner
corners of my eyes since this is an all
matte look I did want to add a little
bit of shimmer just to kind of pop
then I'm gonna add my scare to my lower
lashes to complete the eyes and then
we're moving on the lips which is kind
of complicated so I'm taking this matte
lip liner in night moth's and I'm just
going to put this on my lips just go
ahead and line them like I normally do
then I took this Ulta ultra matte lip
cream and allure I think mine just went
bad because when I started using it it
was really sheer and when I used to use
it it was not as sheer so I think
something's wrong with mine I think I
need to buy a new one but this was the
color I was going to use instead what I
did was I took the NYX liquid suede
lipstick in sandstorm and I put it on
top and once these two matte lippies
well they're both kind of like a satin
finish but once they both dried they
gave the perfect finish and I was in
love the color so you can mix and match
whatever you want but that is pretty
much the look so I hope you guys enjoyed
