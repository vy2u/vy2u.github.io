its oil on this look it's just a nice
kind of dark smoky eye we're not using
any blacks just like dark purples in
Burgundy kind of shades and the palette
I'm gonna be using for this tutorial is
my Sigma warm neutrals palette ever
since I got this palette I've been
meaning to do a tutorial but I just have
forgotten about it I've had other things
I wanted to do so I finally sat down and
film this tutorial if you guys want to
see a lighter look with this palette
then let me know because this is
definitely the palette that I go to if
I'm running late or something like that
it just has the perfect amount of matte
and shimmer shades and they all blend
beautifully so everything you need is in
this palette and they're just beautiful
shades so I would definitely recommend
checking this out from Sigma so if
you're interested just keep watching the
video to see the tutorial on this look
don't forget to like the video if you
liked it and I will see you all in my
next one bye okay first things first I
did apply my primers to my face and also
primed my eyes with these primers as
well so going to get started I'm going
to take this shade in the palette and my
Sigma e-40 and I'm just going to blend
this all over in my crease and just kind
of buffing it out this is going to be
our transition shade now the little
white flakes in my eyebrows is not
dandruff it is my boots primer because
for some reason it kind of has little
white flakes and it goes to my eyebrows
it's really weird but once I do my brows
you won't even know it's there I'm
taking this dark plum kind of burgundy
shade as well and I'm going to put this
all over my eyelid I'm just going to
pack this on so it's super super dark
after that I'm going in with this shade
again that we used in the beginning with
my Sigma e25 and we're just going to
blend out these edges and make sure we
don't have any harsh lines
next we're going in with this shade and
we're just gonna put this in the outer V
of our eye just giving it a nice V shape
there's not much difference between this
color and the other one we put on our
lid as you can tell but it does have a
little bit of sparkles in it you could
still use the second shade that we use
which is all over the lid if you wanted
to do it but I just wanted a different
shade for it and I like the sparkles
that it had as well
after that you want to just pull in this
out again making sure we have no harsh
lines
now we're going to clean it up I'm just
taking my concealer and cleaning up the
outer edges to make sure they're nice
and sharp and then we're gonna go in
with our first shade that we use and
just blend this into the crease again
I'm telling you guys I'm a blending
freak I just blend a lot
and then we're going back in with the
Sigma e-40 to make sure our transition
shade isn't too harsh as well and that
it kind of fades to the brow bone taking
the Loreal super slim liner I'm just
going to go ahead and draw on a winged
eyeliner
then we're gonna curl our lashes and
apply some liner to our top and lower
waterline I'm using this one up from
NARS it's just a regular black eyeliner
I'm gonna apply mascara and then these
false lashes that I've been obsessed
with after that I'm letting the lashes
dry but I'm also gonna touch up my lid
color sometimes when you put lashes on
you want to bring that lid color color
up a little bit and just change things
around so that's what I was doing then
now I'm just applying my it cosmetics
bye bye redness over all of my redness
that I have because I kind of feel like
it's been a little worse lately I don't
know why but I'm just using this to
conceal all of that before I apply my
foundation and then for foundation I'm
going to be using this Chanel matte lumi
a and Sigma f80 this color does look a
little off but it does oxidize to match
my skin so don't worry by the end of the
video we'll be good to go
now applying concealer I'm just using my
Mac Pro Longwear as always and just
blending it out with my Sigma f80 6 now
I'm setting everything with my makeup
forever super matte loose powder it's
just a translucent loose powder CBP's
whatever you have next we're contouring
and applying blush and highlighting I do
have a full video on how I do these
steps so if you want to check that out I
will link it down below it's a little
bit more in-depth but for now I'm just
going to show you a few clips of me
applying at the products
taking this BH Cosmetics blush palette
I'm going to use this one right here on
the end and apply those two of my cheeks
after that I'm taking this Becca
highlighter and opal and I'm just going
to highlight my cheekbones my nose and
the top of my lip now I'm going to fill
in my brows I will have a video soon I
promise
but moving on I'm going to highlight my
brow bone with the cream shade in this
palette and then going back to that same
dark shade we use with a pencil brush
I'm just going to apply this underneath
my lower lashes to further smoke out
this look
class is lips I'm going to line my lips
with my Jordana lip liner in tawny and
apply my wet and wild lipstick in a
Fergie daily and then the gloss I put on
top is Eclair from the NYX butter gloss
line so I hope you guys enjoyed this

up and I will see you guys in my next
video
