for you I have some bikinis some beauty
products and some accessories so I
figured I would just go ahead and show
you guys today and the first one was
draw off with is Victoria Secret because
I got a lot of bikinis and I'm starting
off the year I didn't have a lot of
bikinis because I didn't have like a
pool around all the time and I just
really didn't care to buy bikinis if I
wasn't gonna wear them but now that
we're at our apartment we have a pool or
no every weekend I was like I need some
more bikinis so the first one is this
cute little leopard print one and it's
like so neon and this swimsuit makes you
look super super tan so really neon has
like neon purple pink yellow green has
everything so gorgeous so got a matching
pair of that I also got this lime-green
a bikini you can't really see them cuz
they're so bright but this is lime grade
I also got this coral top so get me on
coral color and it's super super pretty
and with the lime green one it also got
the bottoms for it
I got another string one this one is an
ombre and it has little sequins on it so
just the ombre bikini this one's really
cute as well just have the lime green
and some turquoise in it and of course
the matching bottoms also a pair of
really bright yellow bottoms just you
know again mix-and-match with different
swimsuits
and I also got these bonds because I
thought they would look really cute with
a neon coral top it was actually on the
model on the site so I had to get it and
it's just really cute kind of pastel
neons
they're really really pretty and it has
some of that coral in it which would
look really nice and I also got this one
and I'm feeling a little girly one day I
really love the structure of these I
have another baby suit like this one and
just tie this in the back and it has the
push up as well and it just makes your
girls look really nice and the matching
bottoms for that as well I just thought
it was super cute very very girly and
then this last one like one of my
favorite and it just has sequins on the
front and with these ruffle you have it
on it literally looks like you have the
dad's little seashells on your boobs and
then to go with that I just got again
these are all kind of jacked up I think
just black string a bottom 7 those are
all the bikinis I got from Victoria's
Secret I think I'm good on bikinis for a
while let's go ahead and get onto Beauty
I did go to Ulta it was like a weekend
ago yeah it was last weekend and I got a
couple things the first one I got is
this Smashbox camera ready BB cream and
I got mine in medium so multi dark for
me at the moment but I figured it's
summer I'm gonna be tanning so it should
be okay and yeah I haven't tried it yet
but hopefully it's good if heard some
great things about it and then a
drugstore BB cream I've actually tried
this one out and I'm liking it so far
but I'm gonna get a shade down just so I
can wear it what I'm not super tan again
I just have to have a little bit more
color than I have now to wear this but I
think they have four colors I definitely
saw a deep they have a medium deep I
think it's maybe light medium and then
like I also got three of these joysticks
they're the chroma the Kardashian line
they're little lipstick whatever things
and I saw Jacqueline he'll talk about
these and I was like I want to try them
so I got three colors
I got modern mall which is just a
gorgeous nude and a lot of you have been
asking what I've been wearing in my
videos lately like lip combo eyes it's
been modern mauve and I also been using
a baby doll as well which is just a
pretty pink color so I've been mixing
modern mom baby doll
and been using my floor but it's lip
glass and that's been my lip combo in my
last few videos even now so if you're
wondering and then the last color got
with seat coral it's just a really
pretty coral color and I like these
they're very creamy nice and pigmented
and I got to mix lip liners I got the
color nude pink which I don't have a
nude pink
I have nude lip glosses but not a nude
pink and it also got dolly pink which
I'll do a close-up on these as well I
have an eye this nail polish for so long
it's literally nowhere around me nobody
has it so I had to actually order this
off line on Ulta so it spent like $14 on
this because I paid shipping and all
that but I had to have it and I have it
on my nails now this is SC's boom-boom
room it is a little sheer you have to
apply I'd say three coats to get it
really nice and opaque but it's gorgeous
the next thing is a palette that came in
from hautelook BH Cosmetics is on there
not too long ago so I wanted to pick
this up and it's the party girl palette
I've been eyeing this for a very long
time so I'm really excited to finally
have it and I can't wait to play with it
then we went to Mac a couple weekends
ago and I got the cleanse off oil which
I've done a blog post on it and if you
haven't checked out my blog you should I
recently made another post of my
like haircare stuff the way I got rid of
basically my split ends and how I keep
my hair strong and healthy
so go check out my blog post down below
is this like the best product to get
waterproof mascara off I just love it it
works amazingly so super happy I picked
that up and then I also got another
amount of pro longwear concealer this is
in in c30 I just went up a shade since
it is summer and I'm gonna be getting
darker I also got a pair of lashes these
are the number 43 and they're just super
pretty and kind of wispy and I've never
tried Mac lashes before so I just
figured I learned and try it out and
then I did get one blush from the
temperature rising collection collection
this is right for love and it's really
pretty kind of coral peach color and
it's just gorgeous I just love this
color when I'm tan it looks really
really good and it looks good with a lot
of different looks that I do so I'm
super happy about this and it is this
satin blush as well so the next thing
that work from a little black bag and if
you guys have watched my videos like
last year I used to do a videos on the
little black bag a lot I'll actually
link them down below for you guys
they definitely upgraded their site when
I was on there in the beginning I
remember there was just handbags and
accessories those basically handbags and
jewelry and your occasional makeup but
now they've really branched out and they
have a ton of different stuff
they have shoes on they're the $50 a
month bag I think they have another one
that's lower priced and it's designer
stuff that discounted like crazy and
basically you pick your first item and
that starts your bag and then the
stylist will pick up two other items for
you but you can trade and if you don't
like the products that the stylist
picked for you you can just trade them
with other people there's a ton of
different people on that site and I
personally when I trade on there I find
it pretty easy to trade I don't think
it's super hard to try to trade your
items if you don't like them I was super
happy with my bag this month I think
it's so gorgeous and let me show you the
first thing it is this bag oh my gosh
by what brain is this this is the brand
MMS design studio but it has all these
gorgeous studs on them and they're like
legit studs love it and I love the blue
and brown colors together I thought was
super cute and it is a crossbody and
this is a lot bigger than what I thought
was gonna be I thought this would be a
great bag just to kind of and thup a
casual outfit or anything I just I love
it and you just open it up and it has a
pocket in here and then the zip pocket I
have my other stuff in here but then you
have a zip pocket and it has just a ton
of storage I'm just so excited about
this bag I think it's super cute great
for summer and you guys know I love my
studs my spikes I love it all so after I
got that bag the stylist picked some
beaded earrings and then a beaded
necklace and I wasn't feeling them so I
traded them and the first thing I trade
it for were these
Robert Rose earrings and I actually have
a necklace for Robert Rose that I also
got for a little black bag and it's
really great quality so I knew these
earrings would be really nice and
they're just black with these little
studs in the center and I like these
kind of earrings with my long hair
especially since it has the studs they
just kind of pops and this is another
one that I just love look at it's like a
little Bowl what Brandon says this is
Melly Bianco I thought to see great to
keep in my pull bag and just keep my
phone any kind of loose cash I want to
keep in here any credit cards if you
just want to leave the pool go somewhere
else it's just super cute and it's
really bright so you obviously can't
miss it and I also have a free trial for
