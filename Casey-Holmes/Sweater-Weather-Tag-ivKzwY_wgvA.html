the sweater weather tag and I was tagged
by Ingrid which is missglamorazzi so
thank you in grant for tacking me for
tacking me not tacking me tagging me
this is such a cute tag
yeah we're just going to go ahead and
get started
and I actually showed these in my
November favorites so if you haven't
seen that video you probably don't know
but harvest coffee is by far one of my
favorite since and then also sparkling
icicles those are my two favorite I just
OH I'm obsessed with them they smell so
good
um I would go with tea every time I go
into Starbucks I get a what does it
called venti large whatever I get a
venti iced creatine no sweetener like
all the time I love love me some green
tea so I'm gonna have to go with tea
I don't know like I guess fall time rate
my birthday like my birthday is always
in the fall time around either
Thanksgiving like when it falls on
Thanksgiving that's pretty cool I guess
my birthday I don't know I don't have
like a like a fall memory that just like
pops into my head
that's a hard question love both I wear
winged liner every day and I try to wear
bold lifts as much as I can since it is
the time where you can wear some super
dark lips oh I don't know I think I
think for this time of year dark lips
because whenever I do like a super bold
lip I'll do and like bare I would just
mascara and no wink eyeliner so I'm
gonna go with dark lips but that's only
because it's the fall time
my favorite fragrance by far is viva la
juicy from Juicy Couture that's like the
best perfume to me I feel like it's
perfect year-round and I just I love it
pecan pie oh my gosh I love some pecan
pie like oh so get pecan pie and
stuffing I can't just pick one right I'm
gonna pick two
it's very bipolar especially when it's
just starting to get into fall but right
now it's been pretty chilly so far we've
already had like snowfall like it wasn't
anything big it was like snow that fell
down and then melted but for Georgia
that's a pretty big deal
I don't have one that's like completely
most worn but this one's definitely
going to be the most worn sweater that I
have because they also have it in dark
brown and this is what looks like it's
from H&amp;amp;M it just has little tassels I
guess I don't know on the front and it's
really really big
I love it it's one of my favorite
sweaters just because it is so so comfy
oh I probably should have read these
before I film the video okay it was a
hard decision when I picked it it's
essays wicked and this is a gorgeous
dark dark burgundy shade like it is
stunning
okay it looks purple I don't know so
really gorgeous dark shade I think dark
nails for the fall are of them even
though I'm not wearing them right now
dark nails are so much fun and wicked
would definitely be my pick
definitely football games if you've been
follow me on Twitter and stuff you know
I'm a huge opera fan I've been a really
big Auburn fan so really little because
my dad is a really huge Auburn fan as
well we're the only ones in the family
about our Auburn fans like football
games are awesome especially if you get
to go to one it's just so much fun and
football is the only sport that I can
really get into baseball and everything
like that just kind of bores me
but football tacklin it's just so much
fun
I'm gonna have to go with skinny jeans
just because they're thicker and they'll
keep you warm more and I wear a black
skinny jeans like every single day it's
ridiculous
we all know the answer to this it is
definitely combat boots I am a combat
boot fanatic I love me some combat boots
so definitely combats
I don't know I've never tried it I
honestly have no desire to try it just
because I don't like pumpkin
I don't actually have like a favorite TV
show well yeah I do I'm lying okay my
favorite fall TV show I think this fall
Vanderpump rules is on because me and
Colton been watching it and I got him
into it so I would go with Vanderpump
rules it's not really a fall TV show
like fall themed or anything but it's a
fun little show to watch and it cracks
me up so that and then Real Housewives
are just my weakness
I'm gonna go with Christmas music I love
anything I think Michael probably say
his last name all wrong Michael Buble I
think it is he has an amazing Christmas
album you've got to listen to his music
after this video if you've never heard
of him before his voice is so good
I would pick his music over in sinks
Christmas music because instinct has a
good Christmas album from back in the
day like you cannot beat some of their
songs on there but Michael Buble he is
so good I just oh his voice is so dreamy
I love it so that is it for this tag I
hope you guys enjoyed it it's a pretty
fun tag to do so I'm gonna leave some
people down below that I tagged to do
