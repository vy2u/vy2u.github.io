gonna be doing like a talk foo get ready
I have a lot of new products to share
with you guys today we have the k'kaw
concealers the brightening powders which
I purchased and finally came in so I'm
very excited about that I have this
really ginormous rude cosmetics
eyeshadow palette which I swatch the
other day and it looked really good so
want to check that out I want to try a
bunch of different things out and kind
of talk through this with you guys and
let you know about products I'm also
loving so if you're interested in
getting ready with me and just relaxing
then definitely keep watching don't
forget to hit that subscribe button
before you leave and also hit that post
notification bellow so you know when I
poke there you know when I upload a
video and yeah let's just go ahead and
get started
been 10 minutes I came on camera with
these because I wanted them to sit
before I got on camera it's just more
convenient that way but I'm gonna go
ahead and take these off so these are
the eye masks that I used you get six in
a pack so it's supposed to give
immediate results under the eyes I will
say like taking them off it feels really
cooling and like refreshed and my eyes
feel like just like they're ready to go
so this is really nice so far I'm liking
that I feel like you can't really go
wrong with the I mask and before we got
started I did go ahead and cleanse my
skin with this dior hydro life of my
stellar milk no rinse cleanser and I
just used these Ulta cotton pads and I
just wiped it all over my face got any
excess makeup off and just cleanse the
skin which I love about this cuz I ran
out of my cleanser in the shower and I
was like crap I need to wash my face and
I was like oh well I have that do you
are out there that I could do before I
start filming so that's exactly what I
did I ran out of my drunk elephant day
serum so I need to get some more of that
but I did also apply my sea tango
multivitamin eye cream and then I also
tried out this origins ginseng energy
boosting gel moisturizer which does feel
really good it's not like heavy on the
skin and it has a very Kandy citrus
scent like a gummy citrus is what smells
like so that's what I have prepped my
skin with first thing I'm going to do is
apply an eyeshadow primer and Sigma
actually set this not too long ago it is
the eyeshadow primer base from them and
it
the persuade shade so very pretty
packaging just nice and sleep this looks
like it has kind of a pink tone to it so
that is what it looks like just looks
like a regular eyeshadow primer very
pigmented so I'm gonna ply this all over
and lend it out it feels exactly like
Mac Paint Pot blends out really easily
and does even out the lid which I enjoy
I'm picking my eyebrows again you guys
that's why this one is like so sparse
I've got to stop doing it but like when
I'm stressed out I pick my eyebrows
let's go ahead and start with eyes this
is the rood cosmetics 35 eyeshadow
palette this is the book 3 and this was
sent to me in PR I was really excited to
test it out because there's a lot of
shades in here and these shades are like
my kind of colors is what it looks like
I figured we could do a nice warm bronzy
look of course but I can't help myself
because honestly I'm wearing this and I
just want to wear something kind of
bronzy because I also have to go out so
I don't want to get too crazy with it I
do one mentioned to one thing I've been
loving is a Sonia Kashuk quick clean dry
brush spray guys this is so good for
spot cleaning I'm gonna take my first
brush which is just like a flat brush
and take this shade and we're gonna put
this all over the lid I'm hoping these
perform really well because I really
like the colors in here I think this is
only like 20 21 dollars alright so now
what I'm gonna do is go in with a
blending brush and I'm going to take
this shade right here and put this into
my crease a little bit lighter than what
I was expecting
okay very light shade which is not a bad
thing but I did think it was gonna be a
little bit deeper but it's good for a
transition shade
I need this color so I'm gonna use this
one next there's no names on this
palette just FYI
reminds me of the Bobby Brown Camel
eyeshadow like just looking at it and
I'm gonna put this in the outer V and
the crease below that first shade we
used
Wow also I've had a few people ask me
lately about like what I've been doing
about my back if you haven't been
following me for long I was kind of like
struggling with back acne and I finally
just caved and went to the dermatologist
who's also tired of dealing with it and
like I got to the point where it hurt a
lot I went to the dermatologist and got
some medication and that is what I'm
using now so the medication I don't know
what it's called you should definitely
check out your dermatologist to get
prescribe something that'll fit your
needs whatever I'm using has been
working for me you know it's just been
life changing and I know that sounds
dramatic but if you haven't dealt with
it before you don't understand how
annoying it is to want to wear like a
backless top or something and just have
like this annoying breakout that won't
go away painful and it just sucked so
I'm really happy my back is like almost
completely clear and the stuff worked
like immediately and I was like why do I
have my not come to the dermatologist
and I know why it's because I'm stubborn
but yeah go to your doctor it's super
helpful and next shade that I used was
this one right here that's what I went
in with you guys can kind of see the
fallout on the shades and now what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna go in with this
color right here
I'm just really fluffing all these into
the crease I feel like that's took the
easiest quickest look so I'm going to
take this right out here it's not as
pigmented as I thought it would be let
me try a different brush actually not
really okay that's not as intense as I
would like it to be next I'm gonna take
the very first shade or I'm into the
second shade we used which was the
transition shade and just go over the
edges of these
okay I'm gonna take a really deep kind
of purple brown in the palette and just
work this right here
I'm obsessed oh no I thought I was gonna
really like this palette I was watching
it the other day and it looked so good
but right now it's just not working for
me I'm gonna take this mac 242 brush oh
no no no no no this is just not looking
good
Oh oooh oh like what happened here
it's like there's like nothing here this
could be my fault but I do not like the
way this looks so far I'm gonna take one
of shimmer shades and try to this in the
inner part
okay it's pretty
okay we're gonna remove this and start
over we're just gonna add some stuff
into the creases go ahead and take this
off those I mean that could I need to
try it out a little bit more that could
have just been me and how I was applying
everything and the colors that I used
but I am not feeling that at oh I'm not
my eyelids dry and we want to face and
then not just throw bronzer in the
crease the darker colors really weren't
as pigmented as I thought they would be
coz likes watching them they look so
pigmented but they just weren't working
for me so I'll try it out a little bit
more and let you guys know my hits and
misses because I haven't really seen too
many people talk about that anyway so I
don't know if it's just my blending
abilities but you never know it could be
me I'm gonna apply my primer first
because I love applying primer water and
then like problematic primers to my face
like I call them problematic because
they fix all my issues so I am gonna
apply these so chill coconut first I do
love the original I've gone through it
bottles of these they came out with this
scent and can't be away from it so if
you guys don't know Smashbox did revamp
their packaging which is so fun they did
the same for the primer water like it
has a different font I've had it for
forever so I I noticed when they changed
it up and working with them to show you
guys this primer I'm featuring it in
this video cuz even though my redness
has gone down which is crazy if you guys
have watched me for a while my rosacea
show you speak really really bad but
it's gone down but it's good to use
something like this to kind of
counteract the rest of that redness so
that you don't have to use as much
foundation to cover up your problem
areas and even though this is a redness
reducing primer it does fill in your
pores and smooth out your texture so
it's still kind of doing the same thing
as this but has an added benefit of
reducing the redness as well so I'm
going to put this green primer on so
that's how green it is it's kind of
intimidating I feel like if you're
someone who doesn't know much about
makeup and you squirt this out you're
like what the but it's supposed to be
that green because you want it to
counteract all of this redness oh my
gosh look at that just look at it it is
so smooth on the skin it really does
tone down some of that redness I have
really intense redness here
but this just helps kind of take that
down a bit I am gonna put some right
here in the middle of my forehead about
a bang bada-boom
I don't know if you guys noticed when I
was applying it but it really did tone
down a lot of my redness which is great
and it is very very smooth what you
could do if you didn't want to put
foundation on but you have some redness
and you want to counteract it you could
just put this on and no foundation set
up with a powder like a translucent one
that's just a little tip for you guys if
you're dealing with redness as well and
didn't want to put a full face of makeup
on you could just do that set it with
powder and go out the door and primer is
super important for me because I do have
that rosacea and I do have that redness
that I really want to even out my skin
and want to fill in those pores and
really smooth out that texture because
rosacea can suck okay if I have a
flare-up
we'll be here for years like trying to
make me look smooth okay so moving on to
foundation I've been using a new
foundation recently and loving it loving
it I went to Mart and I was running this
foundation and this one girl could not
stop complimenting my skin and I was
like okay this is my favorite foundation
she was like you look so flawless and
poreless and I was like girl thank you
so much it's easy way essential high
coverage foundation believe this is the
one that I purchased and I could not
find my shade in it and they released
new shades which is amazing I've been
able to find different shades and have
them work for me today I'll be using the
shade honey beige because I'm nice and
soft and right now and we need to match
the face to the body I'm just gonna
apply this my favorite way to apply it
is with the Real Techniques sponge so
again that's what we'll be using today
because I cannot shut up about it I know
it's kind of like cracking for some
reason I have no idea why but it's like
breaking I don't know what's going on I
think I use it too much I'm just gonna
take that foundation and apply it all
over my skin this foundation is so full
coverage it's lightweight and it just
feels really good on the skin okay we're
just gonna really blend this out and
back to the hairline
I feel like applying it with this sponge
just kind of makes it look really nice
and smooth it takes no time at all and
then using that primer
just a super smooth application I really
like it a lot and this foundation lasts
so well throughout the day for me it's
just good you know and that's what it
looks like on top of that primer nothing
else it looks really good now we need to
put on some concealer and just add some
dimension to this face so I have the
k'kaw concealers in five and six I
cannot remember how much these were
should I leave them down below I think
I'm gonna use the shade six cuz I am
pretty tan right now looking very yellow
on camera and I don't know why I like
even my tan looks yellow what is going
on this is what that applicator it looks
like and like I said I'm gonna use this
shade 6 be honest it looks like it has a
really full coverage so I'm gonna apply
this all over you get a lot of product
on the doe foot I did purchase as myself
I'm gonna take my Real Techniques sponge
and just blend this out
and we're gonna hope for full coverage
I've seen people do reviews on this but
I haven't like really really watched to
know what the coverage is like I've just
seen people's thumbnails so well just
see how this looks it's actually really
pretty Wow look at that drab to fab
seriously that's actually super nice it
is very brightening like wow and it's
not cakey on the skin and when I set
this with powder it's gonna be so so so
smooth because this is more of like a
medium coverage concealer for sure I'm
gonna add just a bit right here but it
is brightening I feel like the colors a
little bit lighter but it's really not
that light I like that so far and it
purchased all of her not all of her
contour kits transmen that kind of money
but I did purchase a couple contour kits
from her and I really liked them and I
didn't get the sticks because I just
knew I wouldn't be obsessed with them so
it's not something that I wanted to
purchase for me you know just for a
video because they were pretty expensive
her contour kids were pretty good they
were pretty warm I mentioned that in the
video but they did blend out really well
they gave you like a really bronze to
look now
do is actually take this poll audio rice
powder and we're going to set everything
into place I got this when I did a Sally
Beauty video that should be up before
this if not it'll be up soon and I have
been thoroughly enjoying it so I'm gonna
go in with this Catrice sung lover glow
a bronzer powder this one's in the shade
sunkissed bronzed and I've been really
enjoying in this Pilate oh one that kind
of has a sheen to it as well it is the
baked bronzer in a Pacific tan so I
wanted to try this one because I saw it
in my drawer and it kind of looks like
the same thing and I just wanted to see
how it looked
I'll be taking it this Smashbox
buildable cheek brush and applying this
to my cheeks oh you could see an
extension this entire time I'm sorry you
see there
so this could probably double up as your
contour slash bronzer ooh I like that
okay so now what I'm gonna do is contour
my face I'm gonna use the benefit hoola
bronzer I've been really loving the
benefit contour powder again I'm feeling
very bronzed and my leopard oh step for
blush I'm gonna be using the benefit
gold rush blush is a warm golden nectar
blush it is new and we'll see what I
think about it I got it and I was like I
don't know how I feel about the shimmer
in it but some say it's an overspray so
we will see so this is a blush brush oh
yeah this looks really light that smells
like butt even though it smells like
summer I'm not getting anything good
here okay mmm I wouldn't get that I'm
gonna go ahead and just go in I kept
this to the side just in case I didn't
like this blush because I had a feeling
this wouldn't be my kind of color it's
just too light so I'm gonna use this one
in cheek by Pilate oh this is a good
blush I love it now we have this NYX
born to glow actually what I'm gonna do
is I am going to put on that k'kaw
brightening powder and then I'll put on
this highlighter so I'm gonna clean this
brush right here this isn't the morphe
set that I bought from Ulta feel like
it'd be perfect for these k'kaw powders
so I got these k'kaw brightening powder
I got the shade three and the shade 2
I hope these are good for me I love the
packaging by the way I don't think I
even mentioned packaging you do really
like it it's cute and then this one is
three so it's like a banana color and
then two to be honest that were these so
long ago I can't remember like exactly
what colors they would be and number two
is more of like a peachy tone I don't
know what do you guys think I'm gonna go
with this one first and just see well it
has a little mirror so this is what the
packaging looks like it is really
they are pretty small just gonna kind of
load my brush with this whoa
that is very brightening what if I
should have done this before concealer
or foundation or what am I talking about
bronzer that is much brighter than this
side when you use the banana one too
probably gonna be looking crazy but I
just want to see what it looks like
because you guys know I love like banana
tints like this I try to just press this
right here wow these are really
brightening this is a great way like if
you don't feel comfortable highlighting
your face like the middle of your face
that's me with highlighter you could
just use this you can see where I put
that I really I will probably use this a
lot just to do that to really brighten
the center of the face for pictures I'm
here for this can't tell you which one I
would use more because they both kind of
like the same to me on my skin will say
I think I like the banana a little bit
more but I don't see that much of a
difference so I'll probably just use
both anyway so now I'm gonna use this
NYX born to glow highlighter palette I
have touched this one as you guys can
see and it looked really pretty so I'm
excited to test this out these colors
really aren't what I would go for that's
what it looks like this reminds me of
the one in the Anasazi of sugar palette
I think it's called marshmallow so I'm
gonna go in with this gold shade first
cuz I kind of am feeling like a gold
highlight today
wow that is gold but that is pretty oh
my lord so I just went like this when I
did that that's all I did
wow how have I not heard anybody talk
about this do I need to watch more
videos I'm just gonna blend right here
on my cheeks oh my god that is so pretty
I'm gonna use some new covergirl brow
pencils these are the that's all they
are covergirl brow pencils they look
like this I want to try them out so I
have honey brown and then I
have blonde they're definitely a thin
pencil which I like
ever since I tried those Catrice brow
pencils I've been obsessed about pencils
but the Catrice are still like my
ultimate favorites because they're super
creamy so far right off the bat I've
noticed the Catrice ones are more creamy
than these covergirl ones just FYI and I
actually love the shade of this honey
brown it's like not too dark it's a
little bit ashy then I'm gonna take the
shade blonde soft blonde and use this in
the inner part of my brow I like to line
out the top because I pick so many of my
eyebrow hairs at the top that I gotta
quit doing it I'm gonna have to get
Micro bleeding soon don't you picking my
eyebrows I really like these pencils I
will definitely use them again I think
they're really nice I love the color of
them and now what i'm going to do is
going with this Palladio brow styler
tinted gel I love tinted gels cuz I kind
of also help fill in any areas that
maybe you didn't get that well with your
brow product like look at that whoa that
is a full
I like this color what shade is this
light/medium this is good this really
just kind of fills in those spaces I'm
just going to go ahead and apply these
to my eyes and I'm gonna apply these to
my eyes and I'll be right back we'll
finish off our lips and then we'll be
set for the entire video so for lips I
am using a lip liner that you guys have
already seen I bought from Sally's
Beauty this is this is not it okay so
this is the one is the collab
brandenstein line and define lip
contouring pencil then I also have these
new Tarte I think I'm gonna use this one
the Tarte h2o gloss in sundress I will
not be wearing this outside but I wanted
to try it out for this video I know a
lot of you been asking about how I've
gotten so tan I am pretty tan right now
I've been mixing tanners and I'll let
you know what I think in my what month
are we in my April hits and misses
really wanted to use my collab Apple
audio in the center my lip to do like a
nice ombre look but I think it's in my
purse
downstairs and I don't want to go all
the way down there I saw a swatch of
these and they looked really pigmented
so that's why I feel like I could do
like the ombre look right now this is
the Tarte h2o gloss and sundress this is
what it looks like I feel like it looks
a little bit lighter that's pretty much
the true - color right there and it has
like little water droplets on the lid
and it's just really really pretty yeah
I'm just a matte lip kind of girl though
you know like I like this gloss but
it'll be off like right after this video
very glossy Wow it looks like those
pictures on Instagram when the lips are
so glossy that they look fake that is
literally what this looks like it is so
glossy do you like that gloss if you're
in an area where it's like not super
super windy and you just love gloss in
general I think you would really like
this it is more of a thicker gloss I
feel like this would last for such a
long time on my lips I mean obviously
eating and drinking it's going to come
off but I don't know it's like so thick
that I mean it's not super thick where
it's like sticky but I feel like it's
gonna stay there for a while you know
okay guys so that is it for this video I
really hope you enjoyed it I had so much
fun filming it and I like the look that
I've got out of it even though I had to
take off my eye shadow I even went back
in with this root Cosmetics palette and
I tried to go in with this super dark
brown for my lower lash line because I
wanted to see like if I used a pretty
densely packed brush to try to put it on
and it just wasn't pigmented enough I
think maybe the shimmery shades we've
better in this palette not so much the
Matt thank you guys so much for watching
and I will see you all in my next video
