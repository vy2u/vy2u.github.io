with you its Hargett haul just for
Christmas and the holidays Oh favorite
time of the year I love doing like
messing with decor stuff this time of
year it's just so fun yeah I love this
time of year I love decor and I love
Target halls I love watching Target
halls I think there's so much fun to see
all the random stuff that people get and
thumbs up if you guys like Target halls
too and if you do I will continue to do
these for you guys because target is
like my obsession now I don't know it is
I just obsessed with it I have no makeup
on because I just didn't feel like
putting any makeup on it's a relaxing
Sunday it's pretty gloomy out I don't
know if you can see but it's like 4
o'clock in the afternoon and it looks
like that so I just really wanted to
chill and just have a fun laid-back
video for you guys so yeah if you want
to see all the stuff I got at Target and
some at t.j.maxx then let's just get
started ok so the first thing I want to
show you guys is these little trees and
they are absolutely adorable their
little LED light-up trees you can see
right let's see how it lights up just a
little bit it's battery-operated today
just put them down in here and you can
turn them on and I plan on putting these
in my living room on my end tables and I
think they're gonna be such a little
great addition so I dig it too to put on
each in table and I cannot wait I have
like fake fall flowers I always have out
so I have a ton of those out right now
but those are definitely gonna replace
them and they're gonna look so good I
also got curry ornament and the first
one is the one I showed on Twitter that
I was like so excited about obviously I
mean it's pizza oh I love this ornament
it was $6 but it's huge
ornament it's not gonna break or
anything but I love it it's so cute I
don't really have any random stuff like
this on my tree I usually keep it pretty
traditional like just really pretty
colored ornaments but I wanted something
like this just show some personality I
have a few ornaments like that but I
don't like to put a ton on the tree
because it kind of takes away from the
prettiness of the tree I feel like so
I'm excited but this is all my tree
because I love pizza then I got two more
ornaments so I got the letter C
because obviously it's my name and I
love the yarn here I think it's so cute
this one was four dollars and then I
also got a d4 Davis so um obviously it's
our first Christmas together and I'm
going to have an ornament for them so I
thought these are really cute and I got
different colors for each of us because
I didn't want them to match I wanted two
different colors and these will look
really pretty on the tree I'm so excited
about them another thing that I got at
Target are some new studs I told you
guys I've been wearing my forever 21
sets like a lot lately
and I saw this pack and I loved them
they're just really pretty simple studs
sorry have some really cute ones I think
these ones I'll wear the most out of
this whole packet I know it's kind of
hard to see because the white background
but they're really pretty and then I
also got another simple set like this
with like little pearls and then the
studs set right here because I want to
start wearing earrings in my second hole
so yeah I just got some board to play
with and I can't wait to wear them
because they're so pretty and I got this
little little container from TJ Maxx
it's from Nicole Miller and I love this
it looks so pretty on my new Haworth
dressers also at Target I did get two
more picture frames I did not know
Target had mirrored picture frames if I
knew that I would have went there throw
my picture frames but I absolutely love
this like I said I filmed this video and
I'd already put one in here so um one of
me in my boob but yeah so and it is from
snapchat so I kind of wish I saved it
before I wrote on it but whatever it's
just a really nice mirrored obviously I
gotta wipe it off now before I put it
back there's just a nice mirror frame I
love these for my new dresser in
nightstands they just look so good and I
just I I take a lot of pictures of my
boyfriend and I've been putting them off
and I put them everywhere so love that
okay so next thing is this big old bag
this one has a bunch of random stuff in
it so the first one is something I'm
really excited about it's so cute I just
look like little snowballs oh it just
looks like little snowballs
this is a garland sodor but it has a ton
of glitter on it so just forewarning you
a ton of glitter but it was only $12.99
and I feel like Target has the best
Garland's like they're so stinking cute
so can't wait I might put this back here
for my background Oh
or I might put them downstairs like
around the fireplace or in the kitchen
so they just so cute though
I couldn't resist Oh again I got two of
the secret clinical street clear gel and
luau uh la lavender because I love this
one this is my favorite deodorant
ever so I had to get another one and
another one for my purse
boring stuff in here I got some shaving
cream Chimel a extension cord so
fascinating and I saw this um buy boots
I believe but it's the botanics
power of plants invigorating face scrub
this says it buffed away impurities to
instantly mattify it and reveal shine
free skin for oily combo skin and it
smells pretty good and I'm running out
of my exfoliate or someone to try this
and if you've never tried this brand let
me know what you think in the comments
because sometimes I get nervous trying
out new skincare brands but hopefully
it's good so if you guys watched my haul
I did my target haul in my vlog channel
a while ago I had purchased a mug that
was like a fall mug that they hide out
and it was my initial well I went around
to like the mugs again and the seasonal
ones and I think this is the one for
winter and it's so cute it literally
looks the same just like with a
different color and all of that I love
these mugs little so cute so I cannot
wait to drink out of this one this is
the newest one that I got and now it's
becoming like a little tradition then I
get one of the mugs every season who
knows I don't know if they do these
every season but I love these now for
some clothing items I did get a new
scarf this scarf and there's another one
that's a red plaid scarf I've been
eyeing forever but I went ahead and just
purchased this one because I feel like I
want to go ahead and wear this one now
and then I'll buy the other one later if
I end up wearing scarves like I think
I'm going to but this is a huge scarf I
love love love the pattern I think it's
so adorable it's gonna be so fun to wear
I just can't wait I love these scarves
too because they're so warm and just
amazing so this is that one I love the
pattern I think it's really pretty and
then I got a couple
items so the first one is by Massimo and
I love this it's kind of like a cape and
I love the pattern on it I'm gonna wear
like a black turtleneck or a regular
black talk with it but you just throw
this over any top and what I love the
most about this is this sleeve it has
tight sleeves so you can kind of pull
them up on your arm and it just adds a
little bit more movement to them and add
some shape to this piece which I love
it's not just draped over your body now
it's kind of like moving with you so I
love things like this with a tight
sleeve they just are really flattering I
feel like and it's adorable I just
really like this a lot it has a little
fringe on the bottom in this one I think
I showed in my last target haul and
leave but I purchased the sweater like
this from Moroni and I wore it in a
video not too long ago and I just fell
in love with it because it's so soft
it's not itchy and it's really thick
it's just a nice sweater so I went ahead
and got it in this cream color it's like
cream with black threading all the way
through it but this is so nice it's a
Tremec that's not a tight turtleneck it
feels really good around your neck and
then it just goes all the way down it
does cover your butt and then it has
some tighter sleeves here as well so
it's not like baggy or anything like
that so I have been looking for a new
peak coat because I was in New York for
beautycon and I had my pea coat there
and I went like this and my forever 21
pea coat just ripped and it was so bad
they ripped on the inside on the outside
but I needed a new one and I've been
searching and searching you have found
the perfect P coat but I finally found
it at Target so this is again the Moroni
line and it's just a basic black picot
honestly nothing special to it I got it
in a size medium this isn't like the
skater skirt pea coats where it cinches
in at the waist and kind of flows out I
just wanted a really basic pea coat that
could go with anything and that's not
too dressy but it's not too casual and
hard to see but it just fits really
nicely and it's really warm it's just a
great you know jacket to have and then
last for Target I got some of these cute
carved wood wall decors it's a
distressed gray finish I love this
because I have a picture it looks like
let's not picture it's like a palette
with a
flower painted on it it's really really
pretty I got from hell look like a
couple years ago but I love that this is
wood so it goes with the texture of that
palette in my living room hanging on the
wall and there's a painting I've been
wanting at Hobby Lobby but I didn't know
if I should buy two or I should buy one
and now I'm gonna go buy that painting
and put one of these beside it so I'm
gonna have one on one side and one on
the other because I bought two of these
and I think it's gonna be really really
gorgeous and this color scheme goes
along with my living room so love this
but I saw some similar ones at t.j.maxx
too so definitely check there before
target because they're probably cheaper
but I love these they're so pretty okay
guys so that is it for this haul I
really hope you enjoyed it I know it's
kind of different to put on my channel
but I do love home decor and I love
random hauls like this target hauls are
like one of my favorites to watch on
YouTube so I'm really happy you guys
wanted to see this let me know in the
comments if you enjoy these kinds of
videos and you want to see like more
decor stuff on my channel if not that's
fine but I figured I would ask thank you
guys again so much for watching and I
will see you guys with a makeup video on
Tuesday
