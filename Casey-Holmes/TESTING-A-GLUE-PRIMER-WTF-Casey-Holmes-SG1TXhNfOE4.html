with a different video for you I
actually just got this product in PR I'm
not being paid to talk about it but I
saw it and I was like this would make
for a great video let's see if this
really works that is I'm going to bring
to you today it's like a glue primer
it's very interesting I'm going to read
to you like the PR thing and all of that
but they basically sent it in a cute
little box like this it says the
foundation glue I hate corporate boxes
though so I'm kind of like oh so you
open it up and then it has glue and then
the product on the inside and I just
found this so fascinating so you want to
see me try this product out and see if
it actually works and definitely keep
watching don't forget to subscribe
before you leave and also give it a like
if you enjoyed the video and yeah let's
just go ahead and get started okay so I
also want mentioned to you guys I'm
moving in the next like actually less
than 2 weeks so this room is so bare all
I have right now is like my stuff on a
chair I don't have any tables normally I
don't like a table set up in front you
guys I'm looking at a mirror so if I
constantly look a little bit over here
it's the viewfinder is my mirror right
now so anyways so I got this package in
the mail and I was like glue the first
time a PR company has ever sent me glue
with a package so this is the packaging
and it's called the j1 jelly pack it
says dramatic firming skin with improved
elasticity and poor smoothing you kind
of have me at poor saluting let's be
real I'm going to open this yet footage
get a true multitasking and makeup
gripper that combines a morning mask
lifting treatment and primer all in one
not really good to me the unique jelly
texture helps to quickly and effectively
penetrate into the skin to deliver
moisture for depilated I believe that
size needed skin while firming the skin
upon a gentle patting of creating a
smooth flawless canvas for makeup so I
also wanted to read this to guys this
kind of came with the package as well
and I just found it intriguing and it
has a lot to do with it
so it says why why foundation glue this
looks disgusting by the way moving on
going to be a little more mature now in
this video so this is the ultimate
primer with a clingy grippy texture that
melts into the skin with just three pads
so I guess one two three
it grips make up for longer crease lips
where make
applies smoothly and stays luminous all
day pores are visibly minimized and skin
is brighter and firmer with patchiness
and dryness instantly erase which is
good because right now after traveling
to LA and back I just got back last
night my skin is actually kind of dry
and just it feels dehydrated so I'm
excited to test this out and see how
well it works so it says - basically
when you apply it you need to Pat the
face gently for 30 seconds or until
completely absorbed so it also says for
ingredients the jelly pact is formulated
with deeply hydrating fragmented
hyaluronic acid and fuller in a Nobel
Prize winning ingredient that functions
as an oxygen magnet for the skin Rose
chamomile and sea daffodil extract
soothes skin and combats redness so I
don't know about you but that sounds
good to me we're going to wear the
foundation that I've been loving
throughout the day and see if I see any
difference so feel any difference now it
doesn't say it mattifies or anything
like that so I'm not going to be too
harsh about it but I am going to be like
you know I'm getting oily as hell so I
have nothing on my skin because it does
say to gently sleep on the cleanse skin
and then it also says gently patting to
the skin for a complete skin care
routine and masks experience in one
product the perfect one-step routine for
the morning but could also be layered
with at night so see all you need in the
morning time so we're going to see no
offense I am going to need some eye
cream this is Josie tatcha luminous deep
hydration eye cream I've used quite a
bit of it I can't say I'm obsessed of it
I'm not gonna lie I did for justice
myself I just I don't know I can't fail
assess it don't be mad at me if you love
this but like 6 months of them I kind of
like some other ones better alright
let's open this bad boy up
so sealed on the top and the bottom this
is what it looks like I don't like the
packaging it's just simple we're going
to do is says oh and it has a different
language on the back which I'm guessing
is Korean because it said it's made in
Korea as a different language on the
back but it is English on the front whoa
that's what it looks like cool what's
really cooling - I'm just going to put
in my hands and then I'm going to Pat it
into my skin for 30 seconds or until
it's completely absorbed so that's what
says to do just Pat it in
sans order pretty quickly use that now
it's like super sticky see that okay so
since it is a primer and everything
you're just supposed to go ahead and go
in with your foundation so this I'm
going to do I'm going to using the wet
and wild photo focus foundation I've
just been loving this I'm sorry I know I
guess I'm using it since I know I love
this this is why I wanted to use the
prints video because I just want to see
if it makes a difference with it can see
that I'm pretty luminous right now as
well so I'm going to mix 2 shades I'm
going to extreme beige and desert beige
if you like its blending really well
it's living the exact same as it
normally does which is good because
sometimes with primers like this I
worried that it won't blend onto my face
as easily but it definitely did just now
this is pretty dark I know we'll have
concealer and six at all now if this
isn't all in one product and like you
don't need primers or anything then I
feel like that's a game-changer you know
what I'm saying we'll see how well it
sticks on because supposedly your
foundation is not supposed to crease
it's not it's not supposed to break up
sometimes I find with this foundation if
I wear it for a really long time it will
start to break up and look a little
patchy just because it's not like the
longest wearing foundation that I have
but I really do like the coverage of it
so we'll see if it can last like eight
hours and look completely beautiful at
the end of the day and not be broken up
this is what the foundation looks like
we'll just that one I'm going to call it
a primer
tightener matte on and I think it was
good so far I haven't even put any
powder on and I feel like it looks
pretty flawless so I have high hopes for
this product I feel like if you want
something really quick in the mornings
where you don't do primer after this
primer and then this foundation you can
just put that on and go on throughout
your day specially if you all have time
to like do your skincare which I
recommend always doing your skincare but
supposedly this is a skincare item an
all-in-one product probably so so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to set my
face and finish the rest of my makeup
then I'm going to come back and you guys
know when I'm thinking so far and we're
going to see how well my foundation last
are today let's see if this can last
longer than eight hours look in mom so
I'll see you guys in just
seconds okay guys going back I had to go
get a like a midday lunch slash
breakfast because ate breakfast or lunch
oh so hungry I was like I gotta eat and
then I finished my cup and came back so
this is what my face makeup looks like
right now I think it looks really good
everything feels really great as well
feels pretty matte even though it says
it's not mattifying I don't feel like
super hydrated and it also doesn't feel
like there's a film on my skin you can
help sometimes you can wear primers and
you can feel that primer on your skin
because it's so I know this is my
silicone textured primary but some
silicone texture primers will sit on my
skin so weird and like I could feel it
and it feels really heavy and just gross
like my foundations going to slide off
this does not feel like that at all it
feels really nice it's dry it feels
tightened and everything just feels very
lightweight on the skin so so far I'm
liking it we're going to see how it last
throughout the day so right now it is
4:30 p.m. and like I said a little bit
later but we're going to test this out
all day and see how it wears I have some
errands to run in another video to film
so I will see you guys in just a few
hours hey guys it's currently 636 I have
my hair up in the car because I let the
windows down for dogs
yes yeah so I want to give you guys a
little update on how my foundation is
wearing it looks like it's wearing
pretty well right now I was being a
little shiny whenever I was filming my
second video I went oh that was just
because the lights or whatever my t-zone
I was getting a little shiny but
otherwise I feel like it's wearing
really well I mean it's only been a few
hours so we will see how it lasts a
little bit later in the night but right
now or evening a salad or a salad from
back speed
micros ruggy you are so long whiney if
we're not moving she has her head out
the one knows she says she's like well
why are we not moving at all so have my
spotlight palette on I actually amped up
my makeup because I was building my
favorites video I was looking at my face
it up a little bit you just have the
hardest life ever I'm going to go take
care of these divas let them ride around
for a little bit I'm gonna get salad and
then we'll be good I left you guys in
just a little bit on how it's wearing
later on into the night hey guys so I'm
back for my final check-in it is so much
later so right now is 133 and I'm going
to give you guys my final update when I
think of this product and you can see on
my face I am pretty pleased shiny
I was pretty shiny round filming my
second video and I was like oh I don't
know how this is going to work and I
have been pretty much inside all day I
mean I did go outside for a couple
errands but I feel like if you have oily
skin and you wore this primer with your
foundation it wouldn't help control any
oil whatsoever so for me I would say and
this made me just a little bit more oily
than I anticipated like my form is
really shiny this foundation really
doesn't do this to me and doesn't make
me this oily and I have blotted quite a
bit throughout the day all I've done is
taking a tissue and just dab my face to
get some excess oil off because it
looked so shiny I would say so my
favorite and now that I'm getting so
oily it's making my pores look enlarged
just because of the shininess and this
drawing attention to those areas that I
don't like so I think it was great for
the first few hours but as time has gone
on and it's getting hot humid in Georgia
I need something that's going to keep
master of the day this is definitely not
the product for that maybe if you had
normal to dry skin you would really like
this but for me I just think it's not my
like all-time favorite I would still
want to go through my primer process
with the two that I have because they
work for me and they keep me matte but
I'm not going to give up on it I'm going
to keep it give it another shot maybe
with a different foundation that is a
little bit more mattifying because the
y-12 one is not necessarily super matte
but it doesn't get me this oily I really
think that your primer and your
moisturizers and stuff like that are
really important and they really play a
huge part on your foundation and you
know just everything you put on top of
it because that's your actual base I'm
still going to continue to use my
moisturizers and serums and my primers
and not just use this one product but if
you guys have tried this let me know
what you think I find it so interesting
and I'm just going to try a little bit
more with some other foundations but the
one thing I will say is this foundation
has not broken up on my face no matter
how oily I've done I think it is still
all on my chin it's still everywhere
like it's not breaking up on my forehead
anything like that so yeah thank you
guys so much for watching it don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you
liked it and I will see you all in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
