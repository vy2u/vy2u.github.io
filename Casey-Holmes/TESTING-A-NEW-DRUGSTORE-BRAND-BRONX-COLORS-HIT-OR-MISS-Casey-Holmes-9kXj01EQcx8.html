to be trying a new drugstore brand and
I'm so excited about it I've had a lot
of you ask me about this brand so I
decided to go on Ulta buy a few things
from them and we're going to test it out
and see how well they work normally I
try to buy like a whole face I noticed
while putting this video together that I
didn't have a few things like concealer
and stuff like that but I'm sure there's
a reason why I don't have those items
the reason I don't know but I have quite
a few items to try out for you guys and
whatever I don't have I still will use a
drugstore alternative and I will use
something that I really do like don't
forget if you do like this video give it
a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel
so you don't miss out on any videos if
you want to see this new drugstore brand
in action then allegis go ahead and get
started so we have quite a bit of stuff
to try out today when we using these big
ol clips and we also are going to do
something a little bit more dramatic
normally I like to do something really
neutral and easy but I bought a smoky
palette so we're going to be using this
today this is the brand Bronx and they
are on Ulta calm I don't know too much
about the brand but I've seen it
everywhere on Ulta and I wanted to pick
it up so this is the smoky under cover
makeup set there's 12 eyeshadows and one
applicator this is what the palette
looks like it is a cardboard packaging
I'm going to do anything too smoky
because I'm trying to go out and do some
things but I am going to do a look with
this palette so this is what it looks
like very pretty colors this green is
kind of speaking to me everything just
looks really nice so hopefully the
pigmentation is there the applicator
that you get comes with this little
brush and then a sponge and this isn't
really great just feeling it the brush
is not good but we're just going to put
it inside for now and then you have this
really tiny mirror this is it minute for
your whole face but your eyes do fit in
it perfectly not the best packaging but
you know what it could be worse it could
be more so I'm going to go ahead and
prime my eyes I'm just going to use my
regular primer I'm going to give it a
fair shot and this is by NARS I mention
it all the time I'm sure you guys are so
tired of hearing me talk about it
there's no like matte cream shade in
here to set with so I'm actually going
to go into this contouring palette by
Bronx as well since what it looks like
and it has to highlight shade to contour
shades and a blush this is again a same
kind of cardboard packaging you could
use a face powder or whatever you have
but this split looks like it just has a
little plastic film over the front and
then you open it up and you have a brush
which we will try out today though these
all look like matte colors - the first
highlight shade which looks like it has
a sheen to it so I'm going to take this
color right here and I'm going to put
that all over my lid just to set my
primer I feel like what a really smoky
palette it's good to have your basics
like a nice matte cream really deep
black the transition shade and so far no
matte cream but that's okay because you
can just pick up whatever you have so
don't really have a good transition
shade of course we don't
so everything was kind of blue green or
sparkly or shimmery there's not really a
transition shade just go ahead and throw
into the crease so I again I'm going to
use that pallet system use this shade
right here to put in my crease so we can
have a nice transition shade so far this
makeup look is all about the contour
palette but we need a transition shade
you know what I mean like I can't can't
go in with dark dark colors in the
crease it's just not going to work these
powders seem really nice and smooth so
I'm hoping when I put them on my face
they're going to be it really nice as
well all right go back into our original
eyeshadow palette I guess I'll go with
this one right here I'm going to put
this into my crease I'm barely touching
my eye because this is such a dark color
okay so next step I'm going to go in
with this degree I'm just going to use
the same brush because I'm going to try
and get too technical here there is a
little bit of fallout but honestly and
not that much at all if you can see it
in the pan pretty normal in my opinion I
do tap off the excess I'm just going to
go again on that lid just a little bit
below that purple color I'm going to put
this into the crease so like all on
camera they look like they've mixed
together but like when I'm looking up
close you can tell the two different
colors so next up I'm going to take just
a little bit of this black right here
I'm just going to touch this in the
outer V very very outer V just to deepen
it up a little bit everything is
blending really well next I'm going to
take this NYX up show it this way next
I'm going to take this NYX glitter
primer and I'm going to be using a
shimmery shade so normally what I do is
I'll apply this and apply the shimmery
shade on top so I'm just going to do the
exact thing with the palette
I like this NYX glitter primer stuff is
really good very similar to the
toothpaste glitter glue so if you want
to save some cash it is really nice I'm
going to go on with this sparkly green
right here the shimmery green green is
just speaking to me today and we're
going to put this on that inner corner
oh I mean it's pretty but it's not as
intense as I thought it would be
okay so there's the green right there
I'm going to go on with that first shade
we use I'm just going to blend out the
edges in my crease most blending as well
as the other side okay we're just gonna
have to work with it but that is not
blending and that's going to drive me
absolutely insane MSI shadow I feel like
it looks like all the colors are pretty
much blending together so that is the
eye shadow it's not the worst that I've
ever tried but it's not my favorite I
feel like when I go into deep dark smoky
palettes with the drugstore it's kind of
hard to find what I love just because
it's hard to really master deep dark
colors I feel like and have them blend
really well again like I said this is
not terrible but just I feel like
everything's blending together and I'm
not upset but it's not awful actually
use a gel liner which has been so long
since I've used a gel liner and this is
the bronze gel liner pause the long
wearing formula and it includes a brush
in it so we're going to use the brush
inside by the way this brand is cruelty
free so if you only use cruelty free
products you won't love that then when
you open it up you have the little liner
pot right here and then this brush this
is the liner pot very nice very simple
and then the brush look oh the brush has
a lid on it that's nice
can you put this on the end yeah Oh
finally so I love this because you can
take this liner pin open it up and then
you could stick the top on the end so
you have a longer brush and it's
comfortable instead of just having this
little short to have it's where you can
put the top on it and make it a longer
brush so shout out to them oh god now
it's not staying on come on
let's to exercise about it so now does
it one stay on
no I was just so excited about it so it
use this brush oh it's very creamy
already like dug into that now I'm going
to do a winged liner and we're going to
see how this brush works
feel like the brush isn't giving me a
smooth line kind of giving me a choppy
line a nice black liner one thing I'm
noticing is that it's very black but
it's so creamy that if you keep going
over a certain area it starts wiping it
away which I don't like that this isn't
a terrible brush there's just a little
bit difficult for me to work with since
it's a flat brush and it's really wide
looks like it's drying down that it's
going to take a little bit longer for it
to dry
it does look like once everything is set
it goes matte but we will see now it
doesn't want to like close all the way I
don't know what just happens to lid
pretty easy to clean up and that's a
really black line so so far so good now
we will put on lashes I first want to
see if this will dry Mac so I'm going to
use this broad precise blending sponge
for makeup application it says for an
even complexion use round in to apply
makeup on larger areas and point it in
for precise blending on the nose lip and
eye area
stamping with water before you so I will
do that that's what it looks like right
there and I also brought my L'Oreal
sponge just in case I didn't like it
because sometimes I don't like these
pointy ends because they're really thin
and kind of hard to blend out so it
feels pretty stiff right now I'm going
to go wet it and then we're going to see
it gets bigger so I went and put it
under water squeeze it out a few times
and it didn't get any bigger and it's
still so stiff probably gonna use my
L'Oreal sponge but first we got a crime
so the primer that I purchased is this
pore minimizer studio line it says it
minimizes the appearance of pores so
about that it doesn't say if it's matte
or not we'll just have to roll with it
see for ourselves it's a nice travel
friendly bottle though that's what that
looks like and we're just going to
squeeze it out ooh this looks like my
cane and Alston
primer that makes me excited I love it
it's not like just a silicon primer you
know one of those clear ones so since it
does have a tint to it kind of goes over
my redness really nicely counteracts it
and then for foundation I am going to
use this broth colors waterproof
foundation so this waterproof foundation
has 3.5 stars and only has two reviews
there's one two three four five six
colors and it says that it can do
something that other cosmetics cannot it
stays true to so at the gym or lying in
the Sun and a truck in tropical
temperatures this waterproof formula has
excellent capability with the skin and
gives you a medium to strong cover for a
natural and smooth skin without drying
out the skin this is a really weird bio
like a really weird detail it says it is
a liquid foundation that is recommended
for all skin first men test now I got
shade medium beige I opened it because I
wanted to see the color it looks very
very warm and I saw a review right now
of a girl saying that she is a really
sweaty face and once tried out she gets
5 stars
so I'm 22 girls you guys have a pump
which I like
so let's pump it out so it's kind of
liquid very very warm like holy warm I
don't know I don't know about this color
you guys oh I don't know about the color
okay so I'm going to try their little
sponge which I have a feeling I'm not
going to like but you know give
everything a shot the first time right
I hate this sponge oh my god it's so
warm
oh no no no yeah all I have to choose
from is medium beige which as you can
tell is pretty dark
the other one is nude so this is nude
which is very light that would not match
me right now so it was medium beige
which looks like this online and then
after that is cocoa or cocoa I don't
know
then that's the next shade up which is
super dark then the other ones darker
than that
ooh medium beige looks so different
online like that's online that's in
person to me it looks more yellow based
online oh my god but they do have a
really nice fair foundation it looks
like looks very light guys I can't wear
this throughout the day I can't that's
not going to look good on my skin I'm
actually going to use my Maybelline
Dream matte mousse I love this
foundation it's so good really does make
you look poreless so on top of this
primer I feel like it's gonna look
really nice okay guys so I just popped
my lashes on but I want to tell you guys
I did try this mascara only upper lashes
while I was off camera sassy seductive
black mascara from Bronx and at first it
looked kind of promising just because it
has fibers in this formula like them you
know if you have fibers in the formula
it's supposed to you know attach to your
lashes make them look fuller airy
voluminous this didn't do anything for
my lashes I don't know if it's the wand
or the formula I don't worry like the
wand as it is it's just really weird to
put on your eye I see where they were
going with it but it's not very
comfortable when you're actually
applying it to your lashes but this did
not work for my lashes it didn't do
anything it didn't like attached to my
lashes make them look fuller it didn't
really even cover them like it really
looks like my natural lashes were just
coated in a black mascara
there wasn't anything positive about it
it was just really basic and no volume
no links nothing fortunately this is
another Miss for me what is going on
with this video I'm so sad I go into
these dresser videos with an open mind
as always I love drugstore makeup but
manages going bad
have another thing for eyebrows this is
their brow mascara or no biggest blonde
there's a blonde shade it's this one
because it doesn't say but I'm going to
go ahead and put this on my brows
because they did do them I use the
makeup revolution brow pomade but I have
not set them I like using a brow mascara
to set my brows cause it makes them look
a little bit more natural especially if
it's a lighter color which normally I
get a lighter color in these kind of
things really pretty packaging very warm
the hell I know mother jazz - don't
worry this in a warm shade it works
those is working I'll be fine
so should put this on my brow to set
them kind of lighten them up it kind of
gives them like a highlighted look do
you see the difference normally I don't
go for something this warm feeling like
this brand has more warm tone shades not
a lot of cool toned so this is a color
I'll try to find what color I got moving
one now I do have a bronzer to use I'm
not going to do too much just because
I'm pretty bronze with this foundation
as it is but I'm going to add a little
bit of color to my forehead and my
cheeks I have not seen a color of it
let's hope it's not too orange
remember the models own one that I tried
oh my gosh you guys let's hope it's not
that color if you have not seen that
video check it out down below I got to
show you medium so it's kind of like a
safe zone so this is the bronzing face
powder and it's the studio line a little
smaller than expected but it's okay I'm
kind of bummed that there's not a mirror
in here that's like the perfect size
compact for a nice mirror to fill this
out but structur mirrors cost more money
you know go do what you had to do gonna
take the mr. right brush go in this
color this is a nice warm tone shade
isn't too orange like that both on one's
gonna bronze with my skin with this whoa
whoa even though it doesn't look too
orange in the pan very warm on the skin
if this blends out really well it could
give you a really nice tan look but
right now it's just looking orange to me
luckily I've limit out now I just look
really tan like I just came back from
the Bahamas and I'm tan so I'm going to
use this little brush in this contour
palette we're just going to try it out
see how it works a little brush like
this but I'm going to go in with this
shade right here so with more cool
we need some cool-toned in our life with
this look and oh God come on brush put
in work think the brush works but I need
something fluffier to really blend this
out so I'm going to go actually in with
a shade since that one's super dark and
just contour this side okay and now I'm
just going to blend out with my sibling
brush now apply the blush in this
palette just reminds me of a deeper
peace swoon okay I can work with that
blush is pretty just a nice little wash
of pink okay so there is a highlight
shade in this palette it's this white
color and I just feel like this is going
to be too light for my face right now
has a little bit of a sheen to it as you
can see right there in the camera but
I'm just I'm nervous to put this on my
face my face is just way too tan to put
that light of a highlight on so I'm
going to go in with this la strobe light
strobing powder in the shade 50 watt I'm
just going to highlight with this real
quick yes yes okay now we're going to
finish off the eye so I'm going to take
this bronze eyeliner and put this on my
waterline it's a pencil liner you've got
to be kidding me
so your swatch not very pigmented hmm
look like this you definitely want
something very pigmented for your
waterline and this is not it last but
not least we have lips and I'm hoping
this works out really well because this
is a really pretty color this is a matte
lip tint again from that same brand and
this is in the shade right there no
there's no shade names on these all I
see is ml to6
I really like the packaging of this it's
like a nice matte black too but with a
clear coat on the bottom and you can see
the color see if this is good it please
be good I just posted II met a hole oh
my god pretty pigmented to be a lip tint
but it's not the color I would go for I
think if you like lighter hot piece like
this you would really like this little
lip tint it does feel pretty dry yo
growth is not like this kind of color so
I'm going to get re back off look at
that right there
oh God okay so I'm just going to go in
with this L'Oreal infallible lip paint
and spicy blush okay and that is the
completed look this was a journey a
journey but we're here we made it we got
a full face on a very dramatic looks
something I think would be great for
going out so I'm going to give you guys
a roundup of all the product first off
obviously this eyeshadow palette is
smoky undercover makeup set I do think
it's nice I feel like it blends pretty
well maybe that NYX glare glue just
threw it off and we couldn't really
blend here in the inner corner but the
other colors are pretty nice the black
is very black for a drugstore eyeshadow
just not I'm not obsessed with it I
guess I could say this gel liner is
really great this is probably my
favorite thing out of the whole haul and
it's very black it does dry completely
matte and if you're really great with
gel liners I think you'll love this I'm
sure you have a brush that you love to
use with gel liners I definitely need to
go get me a liner brush to use with it
but it is great very creamy drags down
that so I'd recommend letting it dry
then putting on your lashes just so this
is nice and dry down and nothing slides
around
next step is the waterproof foundation
obviously this did not work well for me
the color at least I feel like the
colors are just a little bit off from
the website I feel like living online
medium beige was going to be my shade it
looked really great but in person and
all my skin it was just way too warm and
not a favorite so let me know if you try
this foundation do you like the formula
what Shea do you like best and all that
let me know what you think and also I
can't find it right now I probably just
threw it when I was down with excels
like hell no that little sponge is a no
for me is way too stiff it feels like
you're punching yourself in the face
with a hard sponge not good don't
recommend it I would pass on that next
up we do have the brow mascara I did
what I wanted to do it did set really
nicely and the brows are locked into
place the colors just offer me it's way
too warm
that could be my fault I'm going to go
online and see what color I got I will
leave it in an annotation somewhere here
if I got like the blonde shade and it's
just really warm like this because
usually I go for a blonde brow mascara
but I will let you know if that was my
mistake or not but it did work I like it
it's not terrible does the job then we
have this bronzer bronzer is very warm
again this is in the shade medium it
does make you look very very chance that
something you want you'd probably like
this it blended out pretty easily and I
don't hate it I think I'm still going to
try it out a little bit but I feel I
feel orange okay so orange and then we
have the contour palette I do like this
contour palette I think it's great I
like the shades in here I will say this
is very very dark I wish this one was a
lighter warm cool tone shade it's more
of a lighter warm tone but you can make
it work it just doesn't look like that
natural shadow underneath your
cheekbones the blush is really great the
highlight I think is way too light this
is I mean you can use this as eye shadow
you could get away with that and still
use this as a blush so I like it I will
be keeping this as well this mascara was
just awful I do not recommend it again
it's the seductive black mascara even
though I do have falsies on I do like to
put mascara on my natural lashes first
and then put falsies on this was just No
was awful as well not a good liner very
rough and stiff I tried to warm it up on
the back of my hand and it just wasn't
working it's not as pigmented as I wish
it was this is the Broncs eyeliner and
yeah I don't really like it there's
better on the market from the drugstore
you can pass on this for the pore
minimizer I think this is nice it did
create a nice smooth canvas I can't tell
you if I 100% recommend just yet but it
did do what it says and the minimize
look at my pores and it did counteract
some of my redness since it has a tint
to it I think that's it for this video
today I hope you guys enjoyed it I'm
sorry it was kind of more of a negative
review but just being honest to do guys
I think this stuff from this company is
going to be hit or miss just depending
on what you want the colors and all that
kind of stuff so it's definitely going
to be trial and error but they do have
some good things I hope you enjoyed it
thank you guys so much for watching and
I will see you all in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
