to be trying out a new dresser rant that
I just found on Ulta calm I'm so excited
about pretty much a full face of makeup
I'm pretty sure I hit everything out if
not we'll just have to roll with it but
I'm pretty sure I have everything so it
is the models own beauty line then to
the drugstore brand it is more a little
bit on the higher inside about ten to
twenty dollars but some things are under
$10 as well you can't even really see
how beautiful is packaging it goes from
like a nice turquoise to a white such a
pretty ombre packaging it has like
raised letters right here it's so
beautiful I was looking on Ulta and they
didn't have a ton of reviews but they
did have a few some of them were really
good some of them were not so good so I
figure we could just try this out today
so I'm going to use my regular eyeshadow
primer which is the NARS smudge proof
eyeshadow base which I think will be
great to use with this because it will
give it a fair shot on I think pretty
much everything from models own is on
sale at least today it's Monday and this
video is going up tomorrow so I will
have a link down below to these products
if you are interested hopefully they'll
still be on sale because there are some
things that have like quite a few
dollars off alright I'm going to add
some tape I forgot what this palette
looks like so it's kind of like a first
impression for bosephus is the Vintage
Rose palette oh here's the colors on the
back so here are some of the shades I
just went with a palette that I felt
like I would actually use so we're just
going to open this up I want to do a
drugstore makeup tutorial within the
next week or two so let me know if you
guys are interested also a lot of people
are sending me tweets about the new
brand in Walmart was it Kiko cosmetics
kinko I have seen it I've been on the
hunt for once I can get my hands on it I
will definitely review it for you guys
but I am wanting to do like a new series
where I test out like a whole line of
whole I'm going to do a series where I
test out a whole line of new makeup from
the drugstore like if there's a new
brand out I want to get it all and do a
video like this for you guys so let me
know down below if you like it or you
can just give it a thumbs up to let me
know as well so this is what it looks
like it has like holographic packaging
the plastic container is kind of cheap
but you know I don't really care as long
as the first on the inside is really
nice
so you do have a very large mirror and
it comes with a little sheet and then
you have a dual ended brush which
actually looks pretty nice so that is
the brush right there I don't know about
you but that looks pretty to me there
are the shade pans of the eye shadows
are pretty small but you have pretty
much everything that you need you have
highlights transition shades sparkle
shades all of that so we're just going
to dive right into it and see how good
this thing is I'm going to first take
the shade Lily and put this all over my
lid just to set that primer seems a
little bit chalky see if all the other
shades are a little bit better you can
always do the face higher to set your
primer as well but I wanted to try this
out a little bit patchy but we can make
it work okay I would definitely not
recommend that to put all over the lid I
was probably just use that as a Bravo
next time and then I'm going to go ahead
and go on with cameo which is right here
very very pretty color and put this into
the crease
not too much fall out either and it's
building really nicely I think it looks
pretty I'm going to go in with the shade
harvest just go right below that color
that we just put on like you can't
really tell I'm not this light throwing
off let's try this yeah let's just pick
that off so I could take in some of the
color away color I'm just putting on
would be really pretty for a mall makeup
look and then I'm going to take rosebud
which is this dark brown right here put
that a little bit into the crease and
then the outer V yeah they blend pretty
easily then I'm going to take the shade
lace which is right here it's pretty
shimmery color I'm going to put this all
over my lid
so it is pretty it's a nice shimmer I
will say it doesn't have like that wow
factor but for a drugstore shimmer
eyeshadow is not bad it looks really
pretty you could probably even wet your
brush with six plus and it would come
off a lot more intense actually the size
the palette I think it looks really good
that's what the palette looks like now
that I'm done you can see there's not a
ton of fallout I think it's really nice
did a lot better than I thought it would
let's be real not usually the biggest
fan of mauve eyeshadow look I think what
did it for me is the lid color I really
like it looks very very pretty
definitely not a Natasha - no no shimmer
I show but it's still really good for an
affordable palette and now I have an a
liquid liner to try love with the liner
this is the I define liquid liner and
it's in the shade black and that's the
packaging it kind of looks like my
makeup forever ink eyeliner hopefully
this dries matte oh my god this is big I
don't know expected to be this big Wow
okay that's pretty large you guys that
is large and in charge
so there's applicator do a swatch ooh
that looks good I don't know if it's
gonna dry matte though you guys know I
love my matte eyeliners it's like it's
really black but what's throwing it off
I think is that it's a shiny with the
liner so it's not looking as intense I
feel like it's a little bit easier to do
a wing because the felt tip is a little
bit stiffer it's not too stiff but I
have a lot more control than if it was
really flimsy so I feel like I just did
that wing in like no time I think I love
my flower beauty liner more just because
it is a matte black liner and it's super
black but this is not terrible so if you
don't mind a shiny black liner I mean it
doesn't look bad you know okay so I'm
going to do the lashes and stuff and a
little bit I'm going to let this
eyeliner dry but I'm going to go in with
some face products which I'm very
excited about I'm going to be taking
this Too Faced base base primer is that
it smooth to correct in prime it's all
about the base for this base primer that
leaves you with a flawless bare skin if
it's applied as oil-free canvas using
your fingertips for a truly enhanced
bass in the flawless makeup all day long
it's going to use this with our hands
today
yeah everything her face is in this
salute to white packaging so whoo this
is like really nice this is actually
really nice for drugstore so that's what
it looks like really cute packaging I
love that you could just stand it up on
your vanity if you wanted to has a pump
this is giving me some serious al vibes
definitely looks like a silicone primer
sometimes these primers freak me out
because these will tend to make me very
oily throughout the day so we're all
asleep we are going to see rickets
mattifying right now I don't know what
it is but silicone primers and stuff
like this they're really great for my
pores but throughout the day it's like a
sliding hot mess so I usually tend to
stay away from primers like this so I
did your self tan and I think I got a
shave for me probably going to use oh
wait these are both in buff what was I
doing when I was ordering that order
like two of so many things this would be
runway matte foundation and it says it
gets totally even with this weightless
matte liquid foundation that will take
you seamlessly from a.m. to p.m. apply
with a brush sponge or fingertips and
build coverage gradually for the girl
who likes to work hard and play harder
all right you get one go down which is
really nice and let's see this packaging
okay so actually like this packaging I
like that you can see the color and it's
a oil-free foundation as well a nice
just plain frosted tube with white
writing I like that I'm doing it so
again I'm using the shade buff o3
hopefully this will match my self tan
pray for me because I'm pretty dark
right now I used loving tan last night
if you don't follow my snapchat I did
update you guys on what I liked more
between me so I'll even be low light
Tarte self-tanner and the loving pan I
prefer the Lovings hand it is a little
bit large but you know we're just going
to work with it okay the first
impression oh this is day girl
thick and light
holy that is full freaking coverage
is very very like wow I need this in a
darker color okay just looking pretty
damn good I love finding a new drugstore
foundation you guys know I like love
love finding a new one wow this looks
really nice
not like since rating my pores or
anything okay color like the tone is
there it's just too light it feels
really lightweight on the skin even
though it's super full coverage it's not
sticky is no I'm going to take this elf
brush I'm just going to apply it on this
side of my face just see how it applies
with a brush so see what way we like
better
probably shits at my Knicks foundation
mixer and let mix it in with this but
you know didn't want you thing go in the
true review you know I personally feel
like a Beautyblender is easier but if
you want lighter coverage I would go in
with a brush but I feel like I may have
to build up a little bit more on this
side so I'm just going to go in with the
sponge and blend this out again so I
prefer this one with the sponge
sometimes or at least lately I have been
preferring things with a brush but this
one I think a sponge will be best it
definitely is not like a satin matte
this is a full matte foundation but I
did not use as much product as I thought
it would and this colors would be
grateful when I get like nice and
lighter right now and working too much
but when I get lighter it'll be good now
I'm going to take this flawless
under-eye concealer and I got a shade
pearl 22 hopefully this doesn't make me
too much lighter I'm going to really
rely on bronzer today
oh is that clicky so it's a quick pen
I'm going to do this on one eye and then
I know I have that concealer palette so
I'm going to see if maybe I can do
another eye with that so I'm just going
to do this one so again one shade of
this teach or Perl this is a bit
concealer so I'm going to drag this down
highlight a little bit with it a lot of
it must be real I feel like this is a
nice concealer up close it was more of a
medium coverage concealer even though it
is thick if that makes any sense at all
it's not bad I feel like it blends with
the foundation really really well this
concealer is not doing whatsoever it's
kind of I don't know if this is melting
into the foundation but it's definitely
like matte everything on my face is Matt
right now if you do not like Matt you
will probably not like any of these
products I'm using on my face the fact
that is to medium coverage is fine
because the foundation is completely
full coverage and I don't really need a
full coverage concealer on top of it
especially to bring it down my cheeks
alright so I'm going to use the flawless
concealer palette and this says with
four shapes that can be blended to match
your skin tone the under eye area will
be illuminated ooh and shadows vanish
leaving you wide and a weight has a same
kind of packaging as a eyeshadow palette
but it is not holographic it's just
silver
letters they're the for change right
there it has a mirror which is fantastic
I'm just going to take this concealer
brush by Kat Von D and I'm going to go
into the lightest shade right here this
is pretty thick - got a little bit of
this peachy shade right here kind of go
on to that same highlighted effect
underneath the I feel like this is a
little bit more of a tough concealer but
we'll see if the sponge can blend it out
a little bit better okay it's not bad
but I don't really like it I don't this
is not my favorite I like this side way
better I feel like this is starting to
look a little bit cakey with that
concealer on and I honestly didn't apply
too much like it was a pretty light
layer all over so not obsessed that this
concealer palette has to say maybe you
could go in and just put this in the
dark areas and then put the other
concealer pen on top but to highlight
and everything I feel like it's just
it's not as good as the concealer pen in
my opinion so if you don't really have
intense dark circles I would probably
pass on this and I did get a new powder
this is the grand finale loose powder in
translucent oh one so this says the
velvet texture combined with a light
finish for a look that's a total
GameChanger
oh this is cute so there's the packaging
very nice a nice oh god how to open it
all right what the hell I just
complimented you whoa okay I don't like
that packaging have to say we'll see you
get a sponge and then you have seal this
does not look translucent it looks like
it has a yellow tone to it and as you
can see that we're going to see how it
looks on the skin also on the inside of
the lid it does have a mirror again so
I'm just going to shape them out be
careful taking off the lid okay well
then I guess the mirror doesn't really
matter anymore if you're like me you
just let go in yeah it definitely has a
banana yellow tone to it so what we're
going to do is we're going to let that
bake and I don't take an eyebrow product
which is kind of crazy I thought we did
so I forgot to get an eyebrow product
I'm going to go ahead and do my eyebrows
and my lashes off camera yeah I'll be
back after I finish my brows in my
and we'll bronze up the skin will match
a little bit more you know okay guys so
I'm back and now we're going to broaden
the face I'm going to quickly let you
know what I have on my lashes I did use
the makeup revolution brow pomade and
this is in the shade blonde and then
from my lashes I'm actually trying out
this brand is the Lily lashes bandless
slashes in faux mink Layla and I love
these they are gorgeous I love foaming
flashes and weave they're my favorites
I'm going to go in with my mu a
professional brush you can get these
brushes at CVS I'm going to dust away
the baking and I really like the way it
looks I really like the eyeshadow to the
eyeshadow is really winning me over have
this matte bronzing powder but then it
oh my god I got two of this - what the
hell is wrong with me
so I might bronze with this and then
contour this we'll see so this is in the
shade 0-1 light tan again same packaging
I just looking a large oh it was pretty
orange all right we'll just try it out
though we'll try it
wish me luck and then let's look at this
sculpt and glow a contour palette
woah these pans are freaking huge this
looks really pretty it really reminds me
of the flower beauty one except this is
giving me like NARS orgasm vibe this
bronzing one you can see the difference
this one's definitely more orange this
one has more of like a ashy tone to it
we'll see how this looks
Ron but y'all alright don't judge me
okay I'm doing this for you we got to
see if it looks really bad so I'm going
to take very pigmented all right I'm not
going to judge it until I put it on my
face
so using this Mac brush
I think if you go a little heavy maybe
so that's one side done once I not done
bronzer really makes a difference really
does I'm going to take it into my
hairline hole Lee Wow okay so we do the
same on this side all right all right
alone having ended with that one doing
my bangs are over here so very you need
like the smallest amount of product so
that's what I'm doing very light okay do
it on my chin kind of make it even here
okay well we are okay now let's look an
orange got if you go in way too heavy
like I just did on this side it is going
to look orange so make sure if you want
to try this out a your not very fair if
you are very fair you or not they're
like this is going to look straight
orange on your skin I do find that it
does blend really well like it's
blending pretty seamlessly right now I
feel like it looks kind of like a really
nice now it is more than orange size and
luckily does blend well there's some
high-end ones that do not blend as well
as this one just blended in but I don't
mind it so let's move on to the
sculpting glow palette I'm going to be
taking this sculpt sheet again this does
have a really huge mirror but is this
morphe inside two three hopefully this
bliss just as well as the bronzer imma
take this is I'm sailing it alright
this foundation is holding up really
well some nice contour shade I like it
now I'm going to go in with the blush
the blushes are really go with a look
where we're just going to do it for the
sake of the video do a little bit on
cheeks like a nice light peachy color it
does have a sheen to it not obsessed
with the blush but it's not terrible and
then I'm going to take this elf brush
and go in with the highlight palette
which is called light up
I'm going to use this on one side of my
face now I'm going to take this other
highlight shade which is in the color
peach pearl and see how this looks on
the face
this does not look the same as this I
don't know if that's supposed to be the
same they deal with the same I'm real
confused this is this isn't a like a
purple glow to it what I mean it's
pretty it's a really soft powder but
then I need to color I'm going for feel
like it accentuates my pores just a
little bit but it's not terrible this
one is like damn this is intense over
here not the easiest to blend out but
actually life is full face right now
going back into this dark brown which is
in rosebud I said to my rzv go smoking
with it today yeah I'm upset with the
highlighter I don't know what it is I
feel like it looks sick if that makes
any sense I'm going to take this little
in from the brush that came in here I'm
going to take a shade harvest and just
going to blend that out okay and then
for lips I was going to use this models
own liquid lip in the shade candy cane
but I didn't realize I was going to be
doing more of em ma B look today I
thought I was going to do something a
little more warm I'll show you a swatch
of it real quick very pigmented again
like I said it does have that minty
smell to it this is more of a mousse
formula I don't know if this is going to
dry down completely matte but I will
keep you guys updated onyx is really
pretty and this georgiana sweet cream
matte liquid lip in the shade 0-7
tiramisu then I think a little bit of
buttercream frosting and put this in the
center the smell like buttercream
frosting holy crap so really quickly I'm
going to round up everything that I
mentioned in this video let you know
what my first impressions are I will
leave down below in the comments like an
update of how I saw a war throughout the
day and everything I love the eye shadow
a lot more than I thought I would once I
have liner and lashes on I feel like it
looks really good the shimmer eyeshadow
looks awesome so far the primer is going
really well like I said I'm not biggest
fan of both
the primers like the silicone looking
one the most beyond foundation laughs is
that primer
I love the foundation so far I think it
looks really great the same with the
stick concealer the concealer palette
I'm not the biggest fan of I think it's
a little too thick for me not the kind
of coverage that I want so I would pass
on that the bronzers a little orange a
lot of orange a lot of orange if you are
more on the fair side you are going to
hate it because it is going to make you
look just for assess the highlighter I
think the highlighter looks a little bit
just I don't know just not my favorite
formula I would say it is very shiny and
intense but on my skin with my texture
and everything I just I'm not the
biggest fan the eyeliner I do like but
it's not as black as I like I would go
with the flower Beauty liquid liner and
I really do like the sculpting palette
like the sculpt color in it was really
pretty but I have my first impressions
on this drugstore makeup brand I really
hope you guys enjoyed it let me know
down below in the comments what you want
