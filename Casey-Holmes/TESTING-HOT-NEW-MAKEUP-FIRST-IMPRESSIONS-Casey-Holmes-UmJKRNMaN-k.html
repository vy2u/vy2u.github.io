trying out some hot new makeup products
that have launched recently that I have
not gotten to try it so I'm going to
test them out for you guys I've had so
many people ask me about this I didn't
want to do like a dedicated video
because I know this has been like
saturating YouTube so much right now
but I figure I'm gonna incorporate it
into a video with other products so this
is the naked heat we have the Urban
Decay Velvet Iser
afterglow or education come out with
bunch different things pur cosmetics
items we're going to test out all these
products see if they're a hit or miss
and if you aren't subscribed already
don't forget to subscribe before you
leave so you don't miss out on any of my
videos so yeah let's just go ahead and
get started alright guys so I have
already primed my eyes with my NARS
eyeshadow primer we're just going to go
ahead and go in with this palette this
is the Urban Decay Naked heat palette I
will be 100% honest with you I wasn't
like overly obsessed when I first saw
this I was super excited when the
Natasha dinner the sunset palette came
out just because you you know you
already know the drill love the formula
everything like that I've also seen this
before warm palette trust me
looking at that palette and I'll let you
guys know that the dupe sued but I
wasn't super obsessed to this when I
first saw a reason is just because I've
had all new naked palettes and I used to
like them there were other eyeshadow
palettes that were out that had better
formulas that I liked more than the
Naked palette so I never used them they
were always tons backburner
I figured this was going to be like same
formula just way better colors in my
opinion because we all know this is my
jam I wasn't overly excited because I
know the past formula but I have heard
that these are different so we will see
I'm going to take the shade out first
with this brush this will flat brush
from BH Cosmetics I'm just going to put
this all over my lid to set that primer
next up we're going in with sauce right
here and putting this into my crease as
my transition shade you do have quite a
bit of pickup to keep that in mind I
personally don't care I'm not picky
about that kind of stuff but if you are
just have some kick ups to take the
shade low blow right here and put this
right below that transition shade and
blend that into the crease
these are super pigmented look at that
next step I'm going to use a pencil
brush and I'm going to go in with ashes
this color right here this in the outer
V in the very inner corner alright it's
super nice and then again in the inner
corner
along with this one which is the shade
in Flay go and I'm just going to blend
out the edges of this so far everything
seems to be lending out really nice the
colors are really pretty together damn I
always do a smokey eye I think it's
because I don't wear makeup every single
day and like when I do my makeup I want
to be glam and a little extra so I
always do a smokey eye I don't know if
you guys would feel like that natural
everyday look let me know with a comment
and I'll do that I'm so sorry
always a smoky eye I just can't get away
from it I'm sure you guys are going to
know what's up say is I wish it was in
matte black in here but that's not what
they were going for with the palette
which I understand I just wished it was
in here okay so I'm going to take a
little bit of this blackest black
eyeshadow from Natasha de Nonna is
definitely the blackest black eye shall
I ever use in my life and I am going to
put a little bit more in the inner and
outer corner then I'm going to go back
in with the ashes shade right here and
just blend out that black okay so that's
what it's looking like so far then what
I'm going to do let's take scorched
first and put this in the center
then I'm going to take the shade lumber
lumber mmm and put this right in the
center so I'm going to take this same
brush we've been using with the darker
shades and we're just going to go over
the edges and blend them out and I
really want that lid to pop a little bit
more so I'm going to take a glitter glue
so again this is by two-faced the best
of the best you can get one from mixes
well it's really good same brush 242
please do it right in the center so you
get up to the crease you can swipe you
can pat it does not move your eyeshadow
going back home that lumber shade I just
need this to pop for me top it in right
there it's pretty yeah that's better
you see how adds just a little extra
shine and a little bit more pop that's
just what the two-faced glare glues does
really just amps it up a little bit it
really makes it stand out the basically
like I'm doing is I'm just driving down
the back of my hand like this taking a
little bit at a time I don't take too
much on the brush and then just popping
it right in the center you can also use
like mac's fix+ I'm sure I just haven't
used that in so long because I'm
personally a glitter glue person I just
like that the glitter glue really
adhered adheres the eyeshadow to your
eyes and it really doesn't go anywhere
so with this eye look the only thing
that I did add was this black shadow
from etosha engine oh no just because I
need I need a black I always need a
black another miss smokey eye just
really helps deepen everything up and I
just like it a little bit more so I did
use that but for the most part I do
really like this palette I think you
could do a bunch of different looks with
it you can do some really nice natural
look especially with these first four
shades I mean that would be a really
pretty easy natural look here was glam
it up a little bit you can add this in
and then you have these other colors to
really amp up your makeup look really
like it I think it's great I think the
pigmentation is nice and it blends
really well next up I actually squash
this on my hand when I first got it in
the mail as PR and it lasted all day
long and it dries so
Oh Matt it is the pure OnPoint liquid
liner and VIP this just looks so amazing
and I can't wait to use it today because
even though I've washed it I have not
used it on my eye though this is what
the pen looks like and you just open it
up and it is a felt tip and no one of it
and there is a swatch it is so black so
now I know I swear to clean up which is
good that's my love winged liner because
I aligned it from my lower lash line up
so I can see all that excess shadow that
I can go ahead and just clean up to make
it look really nice and sharp
that's the liner it is so black and it
is very very matte which I enjoy and it
dries down very quickly so that's
awesome especially if you're going in
with lashes right after that's perfect
okay so another eyes are pretty much
done - lashes which I'll do whenever I
go to brow I'm going to go ahead and go
on to face so the first thing I'm going
to apply is my first dolly unicorn
essence drops actually really Lexi I
just feel like it really hydrates the
skin then we're trying to do primer say
this is by pixie is pixi by petra -
flawless and poreless primer guided by
and protecting a primer very interested
to test this out so this is what it was
like and I'm really excited to try this
out this is at Target the drugstore
brand and this is the color interesting
interesting
see it's like super mattifies so I'm
just with this on my t-zone I'm not
trying to do foundation today I'm just
going to apply my hourglass vanish
foundation and I have two shades just
because I did self tan but I think one
beige will be great
so now hi warm beige and maybe a little
bit of news looks so good the color is
perfect
look at that color match yep before you
set the face I'm going to go in with a
new concealer I've been dying to try
it's because trees cosmetics burglar
camouflage high coverage concealer and
it is in the shade light beige hopefully
it's not too too light and I've heard
really great things about it so you know
this looks like on the skin feels really
good I like the color is a very strong
scent
it's kind of burning my eyes and I feel
like it's kind of burning the skin like
there's like a team whole going on
well no such as like the scent or what
so we'll see hey guys so I wanted to
quickly come on here and let you guys
know that I wasn't the biggest fan of
this concealer after I was all done with
filming it looked really great but
throughout the day as I wore this it
wore off like in the inner corners of my
eye where I have a lot of darkness right
underneath the tear duct area and I
wasn't impressed and since I had this
smoky eye it kind of just made me look
tired like I need my concealer to last
and be bright in that area all day so I
ended up putting sharp sharp quick start
shape shape on top and it looked a lot
better but you guys know it's not my
favorite mainly because it did not last
very long on my skin I'm not sure why
but it did it
all right so that's the concealer I
think it looks really nice than my face
I've ever tried No
so that's what it looks like it is more
of a full coverage concealer so next up
we're going to use another new product
this is the Urban Decay Velvet Iser
now you can mix this in with your
foundations make it a little bit more
matte like your liquid foundation or you
could use it by itself I think it's
really cool that you can make you stand
with your liquid foundations and like
make your own concoction and make it
nice and match or you can use it as a
setting powder it's like a really loose
soft powder which is cool um see what
looks like when it's somewhat opaque
with it whoa do we see the difference
that's like a filter feel like it is
making my foundation and concealer a
little bit darker I mean that flawless
freaking finish on it gives you you
really need to try this with liquid
foundations and see how I like it
because if it makes me look as well as a
setting powder like it does not look
powdery at all just looks like beautiful
smooth skin pile in fact that's probably
my favorite thing I've tried so far
because that's something where I'm like
holy crap I can see a huge difference
with this I'm using the it cosmetics
sunshine in a compact but this is what
it looks like it's just a regular
compact as a frosted
it and then this is the bronzer it looks
really pretty
whoa has a nice tone to it you wouldn't
like that
that is really pretty it's really great
this could double as a contour shade as
well I like it cool so again this is the
sunshine in a compact anti-aging matte
bronzer and it's in the shade warmth
exactly what it does it adds a really
nice more look to the skin I love that
this is the Benefit Cosmetics California
blush very pretty for up since it is on
my cheeks for a nice Coralie slush like
that super pretty
it's really soft I'm just going to blend
out again a little bit I like it kind of
like a coral hue very pretty looks like
a nice natural flush I'm using the Urban
Decay afterglow highlighting palette has
such pretty packaging so this is what
looks like oh that is so pretty it looks
the exact same on the actual product as
it does on the box and it has this
little + one right here you open it up
you have your mirror and you have some
highlight shade I'm going to take the
shade flip which is this one right here
and just highlight my bones back I would
never use like this is a highlight shade
or this one I probably just use these
two right here
it is pretty as a nice shine this is
definitely a highlighter that will kind
of show texture kind of I got sick
consistency if that makes any sense at
all I know it probably doesn't I just
don't feel like I could use this if I'm
breaking out or if I have really bad
texture this is really pretty it has a
really intense shine so I'm going to
finish up my eyes put on mascara my
false lashes and my brows and it'll come
back and finish up with the lips and it
actually is so I will see you guys in
just a second okay guys so I'm back I
have on some lashes the liner that I use
is the aloni London this is the am/pm
liner I know this life so well oh my
eyes
so I use that on my waterline because I
need this look to last all day long and
then I just put it Asha's our Lily
lashes eyebrows are makeup revolution
pomade this Lahti one on my waterline
and then I just finished up my lower
lash line with this palette I used ashes
right up against the lower lash line and
then I blended that with a low blow and
soft that's what I have going on now I'm
going to do my lips have the new urban
decay at lipstick is fuel I also have
this beste liquid crystal lip topper
which I really wanted to try so you
could try today and this one's in the
shade champagne dream Bellini and what
we're going to do is just line our lips
with any like lip liner this one is
number 20 from bite Beauty I feel like I
reach presents all the time
and I literally reach for this exact one
out of all of these lip liners so don't
like it
probably so just a simple new liner then
I'm going to take the lipstick in fuel
came out with you make a heat collection
this was the only lip product that it
kept everything else is going to be
given away so that is fuel with this
makeup look I really like it I think a
complements the eyeshadow palette really
well to the fact that it came out with
the eyeshadow palette totally makes
sense because I feel like any ones that
you do with the palette will go so well
with this lip color it's just so
beautiful
but you guys know I'm kind of obsessed
with the shimmery
is that better came out with and then I
saw bees and I was like yes I have to
try it first off the packaging is
absolutely stunning again this is in the
shade champagne dream Bellini and this
is what it looks like
oh it's so pretty it's like a peachy
champagne gold shimmery lip gloss and it
just looks gorgeous I just want to test
it out on my lips I was so pretty I just
have the most beautiful golden glow and
even though it does have glitter in it
it's not you ready at all so I really
liked it on top of fuelled it kind of
amped up that peachy color because this
is kind of like a gold peach lip gloss
so that is all of the makeup items that
I have for you today let me know down
below in the comments what you see and
let me know if you've tried any of these
products out if you like them or not I
will have a pinned comment down below

definitely going to try and mixing this
end with a liquid foundation love the
bronzer love the lipsticks love the
