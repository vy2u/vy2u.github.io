trying out some makeup dupes so I have
half of my face drugstore in half of my
face high-end I just got done filming in
this video so if you want to see all the
products I use then definitely keep
watching I got some ideas from Pinterest
and I also got some ideas from you guys
so thank you so much for suggesting as
some of these makeup dupes if you do
like these kind of videos don't forget
to give a thumbs up and leave a comment
down below letting me know some makeup
dupes that I should try on camera for
you guys because I love to doing this
video I thought it was so much fun and I
love seeing high-end dupes like those
are some of my favorite kinds of videos
because who doesn't love to save money
so if you haven't subscribed to my
channel don't forget to subscribe I'll
have a little link right here and also
down below in the description box if
you're on a mobile device so if you want
to see some of the makeup dupes that I
tried today on my face then let's just
go ahead and get started okay so the
first makeup dupe we're going to try out
is the Urban Decay Naked skin versus the
Maybelline better skin these both have
skin in them isn't that weird
I love the Urban Decay Naked skin so
we're just going to go ahead and apply
this to my face and you can apply it
underneath my eyes I also will do like a
little swatch too to kind of see if
there's any difference okay so this side
is the Urban Decay Naked skin now we're
going to take the Maybelline better skin
by the way the shades I have light in
this one and I have medium light neutral
in the Urban Decay one so this is just
going to go right underneath as well so
it's a little bit lighter than the Urban
Decay one but it's not too too bad this
is also a very creamy texture I could
probably go up a shade in this when I
was looking at them in store they looked
the medium looked really dark but but
this one's blending out really well so
far it kind of looks the same it's a
little bit more brightening than the
Urban Decay one actually it's crazy I
kind of like the Maybelline one better
look at that it is a little bit too
light for me and it's really brightening
but if you can see underneath this eye
and underneath this side Urban Decay one
doesn't brighten as
underneath right here as this one does I
feel like this mailing wants a little
bit more full coverage so they both
blend out really well they both look
like skin they don't look like caked on
concealer um but I feel like I like the
Maybelline one more so I definitely
think it's a dupe but I think this one
so far is better just with the first
impression I also put the price
difference of everything in this video
as well they'll be in like little
bubbles or whatever yes I do think it's
a dupe it has the same formula it's
still really creamy it's a full coverage
finish but if you want something a
little bit more high coverage and a
little bit more brightening I would
definitely go with the better skin by
Maybelline because I mean we're just
look at it it just looks so good right
so you can see the top one is urban
decay the bottom one is Maybelline and
you can tell that the Maybelline one is
lighter but coverage wise they're the
same and formula wise they're basically
the same okay so for our next dupe this
is one I'm so excited to try and is the
makeup forever matte liquid liner
compared to the NYX matte liquid
eyeliner supposedly they're both matte
they're both super black so this is like
one of my favorite liquid liners it is
hard for me to get away from this one
just because it is so Matt in so black
this one's gonna be high-end asides
going to be drugstore by the way this is
what the applicator looks like it's kind
of like a really thin sponge tip
applicator so this is what the packaging
looks like for the next one and this is
taped down so all I have next to me are
some pliers so this is what the next one
looks like it has a really slim package
and then it has a brush tip as well wow
that was so black that's the next one
that's with one swipe
wow that was super black so I'm going to
go ahead and apply the makeup forever on
my left eye we're going to do a winged
eyeliner just to see a how easy it is to
apply and be how black and matte it is
my camera ran out of memory I had to go
fix that but I did go ahead and finish
the makeup for ever'one and while I was
finishing it up I just saw that these
both dried completely matte I mean look
at that that's amazing the one thing I
will say about the makeup for everyone
that I absolutely love right off the bat
is the applicator so easy to use
it's very controlled and it's flexible
enough to wing out that liner and drag
it in right off the bat I can tell that
this is really easy to apply like the
brush tip is just so fine I mean it's
not too thin but the brush definitely
has like the right amount of thickness
to where it's easy to go ahead and line
the eye but it doesn't go all over the
place you know some brush tips eyeliners
just kind of spread out and go
everywhere and they don't stay in that
same shape that's what I'm talking about
this is if I don't like but this one is
not doing that really easy to build as
well so this line is coming out better
than this line I'm going to wait just a
few minutes for this to dry and see how
well it dries and then I will come back
and let you guys see if it's a dupe or
not okay so I'm back everything looks
like it's dried and honestly you guys
this is the next side and this is the
makeup forever one which I could totally
fix that line but you know we're not
going to do that right now because if I
try to fix it I'm gonna mess it up
honestly it's exactly the same if
anything the next one has a tiny bit
more shine to it than this one this was
just like completely matte carbon black
honestly I feel like it's a dupe just
because the eyeliner dried matte it is
so hard to find a drugstore eye liner
that is matte and not shiny I'm a big
fan of my eyeliners I don't like shiny
ones at all so I think this is a
complete dupe and for the price tag I
would definitely go with the next one I
don't know if this one has been talked
about yet but I want to try it out for
myself because I love the high-end
mascara so the high-end mascara is the
Too Faced better than sex mascara I love
this one it's so lightweight and it
really just gives you amazing volume for
your lashes and then the dupe is
supposed to be the L'Oreal Paris carbon
voluminous leopard L'Oreal voluminous
carbon black mascara I remember when
people used to talk about this one all
the time I was never like a huge fan of
it like I don't remember gravitating
towards this mascara a lot but it's been
a couple years since I've even tried it
and I'm down to see if it's a dupe for
the Too Faced better than sex one
because this is like one of my favorite
mascaras ever especially since they came
out with a waterproof version it's just
so good so I'm going to go ahead and
apply this one on
I so this is what the wand looks like
the Too Faced better than sex you can
see it kind of goes in in the middle and
is thicker on the end one thing about
this mascara that does suck is it does
the lake so just keep that in mind but
it's a really nice black formula and it
just gives you so much volume so that is
the Too Faced better than sex would love
that mascara and now I'm gonna try
L'Oreal voluminous carbon black mascara
my hairdresser saw my snap because I
posted these extensions on my snap and I
was like geez maybe want to go lighter
and she texted me and said just saw your
snap let's go lighter like girl dog I'm
gonna go lighter now I'm gonna text you
off this video and like tell her girl
let's do it right off the bat I feel
like this is more of a drier formula
then they better in the section line I
feel like the better and sex ones like
pretty wet kind of I don't know if
what's the right term I don't even know
if I would say creamy if anything I feel
like the L'Oreal carbon black one is
nice but I feel like the two-faced one
does give more length see if we can do
it this way can we do it mostly oh no
I'm terrible I definitely think the
L'Oreal one gives a lot of volume but I
think the Too Faced one separates a
little bit better and gives more length
I think it kind of adds like that
eyelash extension kind of look to your
eyes I know this is a cult favorite of
everyone's and you're probably gonna
kill me for it but I do not think that
this is a dupe for the Too Faced better
than sex one just because the Too Faced
one separates a little bit better it's a
lot more black also adds a lot more
length than the carbon black one so I
would have to say it's not a dupe but
it's not a bad mascara if you're looking
for something really deep and dark that
gives you nice volume then I would go
for this one at the drugstore now this
is a L'Oreal glam bronze bronzer I'm
obsessed with this one this is in the
shade medium you can also go up a shade
this has more of a red undertone it
gives you that natural tan look and then
it's a dupe with the Too Faced dark
chocolate Soleil which is pretty deep
but again has that like red undertone to
it this looks a lot lighter on camera
but it looks exactly the same in person
also one other thing that's different is
this one does have some shimmer in it
it's like a golden shimmer but I've
mentioned this one before you can't
really see it on your face so I could
see how someone would say
this is a dupe but what we're going to
do is we're gonna go ahead and apply to
our face and see what we're working with
so I'm going to take the two-faced one
first very lightly going to put this on
my face to bronze it amazing what
bronzer does to your face like looking
at the viewfinder I'm like I like this
side better already
okay and now I'm going to dust off this
brush and we're going to go in with the
L'Oreal glam bronze which I've used this
before and I love it so this is a dupe
that I'm all about it it's looking
pretty good honestly it's not as dark
you could probably get the deepest one
and it'd be as dark as a two-faced one
but honestly it looks really good like I
said with this bronzer you can't really
see the gold shimmer in it it really
looks the same I need to blend but holy
SH that's crazy I definitely think you
could save some money on this and buy
the L'Oreal one because a they blend out
just as well B they have the same
undertone they look pretty much the same
the only thing that we different is that
this one is a little bit more pigmented
so the top one is the Too Faced and the
bottom one is the Lorrie oh look at that
I say it works why not if you could save
some money right so this next dupe is
actually a brush and not a makeup
product I believe someone in the
comments of one of my latest videos told
me about this but it's a brush set from
Target and you get this whole set for I
think it's five dollars like $4.99 she
told me the other brushes are but
this one is a dupe for the Anastasia
number-23 which um doesn't that look so
similar I'm super excited about this but
for $4.99 you get four brushes that's
insane
so these are the two side-by-side
obviously this one's really dirty but um
they look so similar so I'm going to
take one of my favorite highlighters
which is the Charlotte Tilbury
highlighter this is the bar of gold it's
not picking up as much product as the
anasazi one but it's working whoa okay
see it doesn't really apply as much
there we go
you kinda have to go in a couple times
to really get the product on the bra
and to distribute it on your face I kind
of it crazy yeah so it looks really good
over here it's nice and blended as well
as over here I will say the Anastasio
and picks up more product but if you
don't want to splurge on this brush
definitely buy this little set comes
with like a foundation brush it
concealer brush that blush brush I
showed you and this one and honestly it
does like the same thing okay so the
last tip I have for you guys is
involving a Kylie lip kit and the NYX
liquid suede lip sticks I did a whole
video on these when they first came out
I'll link it down below if you want to
check them out so we're going to see if
this is a dupe so we have the Kylie lip
kit and Dulce Kay and then the liquid
suede in sandstorm so the top one is the
kylie one the bottom one is NYX the
kylie one has I feel like a little bit
of a deeper tone to it but they look
pretty similar and you never know when
they dry so I'm going to go ahead and
apply the kylie one on my high-end side
so that is Dulce Kay from Kylie and then
for the licks Nick wood suede I like the
app care on this too yeah you can see
there's a difference in there I mean if
you kind of like that darker nude look
then you might like sandstorm and it
might be a dupe but personally I feel
like they do look pretty dang different
oh this one is a lot darker than this
one but if you wanted to deepen this up
you can always go in with a darker lip
liner from NYX or something I would have
to look and see if I could find some
that I have that you could probably put
underneath this but it's always an
option you could do a darker deep kind
of brownie nude and put this on top and
then it would look a little bit more
similar to this I would say that this
one is not a dupe unless you wanted
something similar to the bit again you
can always do a lip liner underneath it
to deepen it up okay guys so that is it
for this dupes video I think we found
more dupes than non dupes a lot of
drugstore stuff is super similar to
high-end and I'm just so excited about
it and also I'm glad that they are
because the drugstore is getting pretty
pricey sometimes I feel like my face
looks pretty symmetrical nothing's
really different at all I mean it looks
the same with the products that I used
so I think that it's awesome minus this
because I did have to go in with Dulce
Kay
put it all over my lips I hope you guys
enjoyed this if you did don't forget to
give it a thumbs up and let me know in
the comments some other dupes that I
should try if you have any dupes that
you think I don't know about leave them
in the comments I'm totally down to try
anything and I will see you all in my
next video bye
I can never have a fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
