trying out some makeup dupes I went on
Twitter at this time and asked you guys
to send me over some makeup dupes that
you wanted me to try on camera to see if
they're actually dupes or not it's a lot
of fun to have you guys into the video
as well so I will be posting the tweets
in this video if I chose your item to
try out I do have I believe six dupes to
try out today we have like the
foundation powder so if you want to be a
part of this next time and send me some
dupes to try out next definitely follow
me on Twitter I always have my social
media links right here so you guys can
go follow and yeah if you liked this
video don't forget to give it a thumbs
up and leave a comment down below
letting me know if you want me to try
any other dupes I will definitely look
at these comments and also what is your
favorite drugstore product I have a huge
drugstore haul coming for you guys
because I went out to find these dupes
and they ended up shopping a lot so be
on the lookout for that by the way if
you're wondering where this top is from
it is from Nasty Gal
I really like it but like it keeps going
up so I'm trying to keep my arms down
the first one comes from Savannah and
she said the NYX dream catcher palette
versus the Too Faced chocolate bar
palette now she said dream catcher
palette but there were three versions of
the dream catcher bat palette from NYX
so I just got this one because it looked
pretty and if I like it this is the kind
of colors I would go for this is in the
shade golden horizons so this one
compared to the Too Faced chocolate bar
palette which I love this palette I did
crack my black eyeshadow so it's kind of
messy which is why I have really dug
into it but I do really love this
palette at first I thought I couldn't
find it because I didn't see on the
display where it said dreamcatcher but
you have to like a look at the palette
and it says dream catcher palette oh
here are the two side by side I mean
there are some shades that are very
similar but I guess we could see mainly
like formula wise if they're the same
okay so I'm going to go ahead and do
this side drugstore at this side
high-end so the first color that I'm
going to take is this nice medium tone
one right here I'm not doing anything
too smoky just because I have to use a
mascara in this one again and last time
you couldn't see with the eyeliner so
not doing anything too crazy but we are
going to use these shadows
you
by the way the brush I'm using is a more
feet m4 for one and then in the Too
Faced palette I'm going to go in with
mousse right here right off the bat two
things definitely has a little bit more
pigmentation right when you dip your
brush in but these colors are like
pretty much exact I'm going to take the
shade right here this darker shade which
kind of looks like truffled in the Too
Faced chocolate bar palette I'm just
going to put this into the crease and
outer V and you don't want to go above
the first crease shade that we put on
just keep it right underneath it then
the chocolate bar palette I'm going to
take truffle and put this in the outer V
and again blend it into the crease
these look exactly the same like no I'm
gonna lie I'm gonna take my Mac 242
brush which is absolutely amazing and
I'm gonna go in I'm gonna go in with
this light golden shade
you
so then I'm going to wipe off my
brushing on with a two-faced - caramel
color these are looking so similar this
one might be just a tad bit lighter but
they look so freakin similar so I'm
going to finish this off after I do my
brows but that's pretty much what I'm
going to do right now but honestly these
are pretty freaking similar like the
shades that are in here if they look
similar to a color in here they're
pretty much a dupe that is insane like
it doesn't even look different next is
from Tess and this is the it's Blondie's
fans it's so sweet so hello Tess she
said benefit roller lash and
Maybelline's lash sensational mascara
let's see if this one's a dupe so we all
know I absolutely love this mascara I
have so many of them I go through them
they're just amazing and then the
Maybelline lash sensational
I believe I've tried this before and I
really liked it so I kind of have high
hopes for this so if you're wondering
this is what it looks like I'm pretty
sure I've tried this and liked it
couldn't find it my collection so this
is what the wand of this one looks like
it's kind of curved and its spiky
this one does have a little bit of a
different wand but it's still curved and
spiky it's just a little bit smaller
let's see bottoms maybelline top is
benefit so pretty similar wands just a
size difference um these look so similar
oh my god well I guess now I can just
purchase the mainly 1 so that's benefit
one I believe this one's a dupe they
both give such great volume they step
rate really well they're not clumpy
they're both really black this gets a
thumbs-up for me because honestly you
can't tell the difference they both look
amazing moving on to the most terrifying
part the Revlon Colorstay combination
oily version with the Estee Lauder
Double Wear stay in place makeup now I'm
hoping a that these colors kind of match
because I had to get color matched it is
state water and I haven't worn Revlon
Colorstay in years they now have a pump
for it which i think is awesome
a sailor does not come with a pump you
can buy a Mac pump and will fit
perfectly on top of this if you guys
have watched me for a really long time
hey let me know in the comments if you
know what I'm about to say but I used to
use this all the time this was like the
only foundation I would use hopefully
these work so we're going to go ahead
and do Revlon Colorstay on my left side
of the face so this is the texture of
the Revlon Colorstay it's just a little
bit runny I'm actually going to use a
Beauty Blender to apply because I know I
like the Estee Lauder with the Beauty
Blender
okay so there is the Revlon Colorstay I
actually think it looks really good -
the fact that it's kind of separating on
my forehead out if you guys can see it's
not covering this redness really well up
here difference between the side and
this side it covered really well we're
going to go in with the Estee Lauder
Double Wear the shade I got in this one
is three-in-one ivory beige and the one
I got in this one is 330 this kind of
that same texture where it's a little
bit runny
one thing about estee lauder double wear
is it always covers my nose redness like
a freaking champ every single time
looking at them side by side honestly
you can't tell a difference they both
have a full coverage finish a little bit
of redness peeking through just a tad on
the cheek so that something that
concealer can cover up I can't say
longevity-wise
if it's a dupe but so far first
impression wise they look exactly
exactly the same so I'm going to go
ahead and put some concealer on and some
powder on and we're going to see how
both of them react this we don't have a
drugstore dupes concealer today I'm just
going to use this Tarte concealer so the
shape tape contour concealer in a light
medium I'm just going to put this all
over and blend it in and then we're
going to set it with another possible do
and then we'll see if these handle the
concealer and powder the same way okay
so that is both of them with concealer
on my face they both look really good
pretty much identical so Becca set
airspun translucent powder versus Laura
Mercier translucent powder so I have
both of them right here I went on a hunt
for this if you follow me on snapchat
you know it took me forever to find this
freaking powder but I ended up finding
it at Walmart and I got the shade
naturally neutral they were out of
translucent and I have translucent in
the Laura Mercier powder so you get a
lot of product in here this is 2.3
ounces and it was $5 I think that's like
actually 6 if you round it up but holy
crap I'm going to take my Beauty Blender
like I always do I'm just gonna take
some powder and bake underneath my eyes
one thing that is completely different
about this one in Laura Mercier one this
has a scent very strong strong scent so
just be forewarned of that the other
side of my Beauty Blender and use the
Laura Mercier translucent setting powder
this one doesn't have a scent I like
smell like it's like going up my nose
and then what I'm going to do so I'm
going to do my eyebrows I'm going to
come back we're going to i'p this away
because it looked like a crazy person
okay so my brows are done now I'm gonna
take my duo fiber brush this is the MUA
professional brush this is from the
drugstore definitely check it
out I'm just going to just away this
baking
if you can tell a difference like which
ones which let me know but so far I
think everything looks pretty much
identical powders are very very similar
I feel like with translucent powders a
lot of them are gonna be similar the
only difference is that this has a very
strong scent so if you're sensitive to
scents then you might want to pass on
this but they both brightened up my face
they both set really nicely I mean I'm
really liking it you can't tell a
difference like you just can't Olivia
said the hoola bronzer and the NYC sunny
bronzer I see that all the time on
Pinterest and so do I so I want to try
it out I think I may have tried this out
like a long time ago but I can't
remember that we're gonna try it against
it because I can't remember so this is
the benefit hoola bronzer one of my
all-time favorite bronzers as you can
tell it's getting there and I think I've
had this for ever I actually should
probably throw this away and start using
a new one but you know it's just like I
have love for then the NYC smooth skin
bronzer and sunny is supposed to be a
dupe so we're going to check that out so
here's what they look like side by side
I would say benefits a little bit deeper
but they have that kind of same bronzy
ashy tone to them I'm going to take the
NYC sunny bronzer I'm using a more feet
in five to seven I'm going to see if I
can bronze and contour with this
get down here cuz my neck need some
bronzing does anyone elses neck like not
get tan I mean my might get a little bit
of Sun but the rest of my body can be
super tan and my chest is either going
to be super fair or it's going to get
really red because my chest gets so red
this bronzer looks really light but on
the skin it looks so good
wiping off that brush we're going to go
in with the benefit hoola bronzer
this might be like my favorite favorite
dupes video has ever done because
everything is just turning out so well
I think the NYC one might be just a tad
bit more warm
they both are kind of a lighter bronzer
but they both look so good to warm up
the face to contour this is a dupe
definitely check this out I mean I'm not
saying don't buy this because this is
one of my favorite bronzers but if you
don't want to spend money on this I mean
this is amazing and it's really compact
nice for traveling as well and now I'm
going to be applying my last Duke for
this video and this one comes from Elise
Tiana I hope I said that right she said
too faced melted lipstick and melted
schwa versus the Maybelline Color jolt
in stripped down
I've tried these both separately I love
them both separately but I haven't tried
them together to see if they're dupes so
I'm really excited to see if they are oh
it looks like the only thing that might
be different is the texture like one's a
little bit more glossy that's the
Maybelline Color jolt and then that
one's the two faiths that one's the
Maybelline Color jolt and that was a Too
Faced melted Chihuahua that looks pretty
freakin promising let's put this on our
lips shall we
and they both have like that same sponge
applicator as well I figured I would
show you guys as you can see they both
have that same kind of applicator which
is great look at that the only thing I
would say is different is the main ring
one does have a little bit more of a
glassy tinge to it but honestly that's a
color deep right there they both feel
really good on the lips I cannot believe
that okay guys so that is it for this
dupes video I don't know if you guys can
tell the difference because I honestly
can't I feel like they both look exactly
the same I mean that is in sane I don't
feel like I've been this impressed by
dupes video that I've done in a long
time like this looks very identical the
foundation looks like that occult it
handled product the same way I shadows
with the same lip color looks the same
every single dupe I used in this video
is a plus definitely an alternative for
high-end products check them out let me
