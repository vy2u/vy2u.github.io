testing out some drugstore makeup this
is all actually from the drugstore haul
I just did not too long ago if you
haven't seen that video I will leave it
down below but I figured today I would
try some of these new drugstore products
out and let you know how they wear and
all that kind of stuff so we'll be doing
a end of the day update for you guys
because I feel like that would be most
helpful so if you like this kind of
video don't forget to give it a thumbs
up and subscribe to my channel as well
and then leave a comment down below
letting me know what I should try and
next from the drugstore because I love
the drugstore let me know when I should
try next in the comments below and let's
get started with these new products so
today I'm going to try this mu a
professional no crease eyeshadow base
now I have very oily eyelids so if this
works I'm going to be so excited I
usually only use the NARS smudge proof
eyeshadow base but I figured I'll give
this a try actually purchase a lot of
stuff from the Mei brand in my drugstore
haul so I might do like a one brand
tutorial I should have to go get like a
foundation and concealer from them but
this is what the packaging looks like
it's just a nice squeezy tube I think
yes and that's what it looks like right
there and when you blend it out has like
a cream base it kind of feels greasy oh
no I don't know I don't know how this
gonna work on my eyes but we'll try it
out so I'm just going to apply this all
over so that's the primer on actually
like the way that it evened out the lids
I think that's really nice okay so I
went ahead and put some tape on my eyes
and now I'm just going to set the primer
so I'm going to use this anyway
professional but this is the nude
eyeshadow palette because it's what it's
called and I'm just going to take this
cream shade right here and I'm going to
put this all over my lid can't decide
what I shout I want to use I think I'm
going to use a mixture of this and the
l'oreal one then i have my eye on
hopefully this eyeshadow base hopes
everything stay on really well because
of my eye shadow creases literally i die
a little inside I'm just like so moving
on I am going to use this eyeshadow
again this palette and I think I'm going
to take this shade right here is this
like a mid-tone shade yeah can really
tell because the lights are so freakin
bright in my eyes I'm going to take this
one right here first and put this in
my crease not too intense but it's a
nice light brown shade you feel me so
the next palette that I wanted to play
with it is a gorgeous L'Oreal quad it's
the L'Oreal Paris French biscuit quad
and oh my gosh just how gorgeous are
these I did swatch them in my drugstore
video but I haven't put them on my eyes
yet so I'm just going to take a Mac 217
and this Brown right here and I'm just
going to blend this right below that
transition shade
it blended really well like look at that
I'm going to dip back in this anyway
palette I'm going to take this dark
brown right here it's actually a dark
matte Brown and I'm going to put this in
the outer V
very nice very nice does eyeshadow to
blending very well going back into this
one I think what color do I want to take
like this blue black is speaking to me
but I feel like that's too smoky for
today I'm going to go for the blue black
this is my favorite eyeshadow brush to
pack on color on the lid and like really
hold glitter it's the mac 242 brush it's
just been one of my all-time favorites
for such a long time now
at first I thought looks going to be
more of a navy black but it's turning
out to be a really nice glittery navy
blue color if I was using this for just
a regular look I would definitely use a
glitter glue just so that the glitter
stayed on the eye and that the shadow is
nice and vibrant I'm going to take a
little brush like this I'm going to go
in with that brown again I'm just going
to blend the edges of this Navy color yo
where's all the glitter go I just wonder
if you had a glitter glue like what it
lasts longer the glitter stick so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take my finger
with this shade I'm just gonna pop that
in the center of the lid like that give
it a little pop so I added a little bit
of dimension to look but none of that
glitter is on my eyes anymore which is
really disappointing because that was my
favorite part I'm gonna use a regular
side for my upper lashes and the
waterproof for my bottom lashes so this
side is the regular and this is a wand
camera helmet just was things like a
dollar not too impressed by it honestly
not the best mascara not lifting them or
curling them at all it's just kind of a
blah mascara so I'm gonna put on some
false lashes and they'll be right back
and we're going to play with some
foundation so be right back they
actually don't have a primer to try what
I'm going to do is just take a regular
primer this is my cane in Austin a
primer protect primer that is
disgustingly gross so I put this I
normally put paramah so now I want to
taking this elf sponge and this is what
it looks like I got this on ulta.com
when I first got it in the hall it felt
really stiff but I just wet it with
water and it is so bouncy and cute you
see that I'm super excited to try this
out so I'm gonna try it out actually
with
Maybelline Dream matte mousse foundation
I don't believe I've ever tried this
before it I've seen it around for like
the longest time is it around four years
so I'm really excited to test this out
hopefully a Beauty Blender is the way to
go with this this is the shade medium
2.5 don't know if this will be my shade
hopefully it won't be too off I've just
been going to the lake and getting like
a little tan and I don't have anything
to match it so well this might match
though that's a lot darker than I
expected it to be doesn't have like a
scent to it let's see let's use the
bottom of this beauty blender i just
coated the bottom with this we're gonna
just bounce it on the skin wow that's a
lot darker okay we're going to drag this
down a little bit I'm plying this with
the Beauty Blender it's kind of hard to
use I feel like we have to use the top
of it we'll do half with the Beauty
Blender and then half with a brush
really love the Maybelline is superstay
better skin if you guys and watch me for
a few weeks you know I love that
foundation this is not bad see that and
it's not bad with this five take this
down the neck a little bit I'm gonna
have like a tan line from make up with
this choker like look good - just
kidding is my it brushes with old text
the airbrush essential bronzer this is
like the collab it cosmetics Ulta half
together I'm just going to dip this in
here but that feels really smooth on the
skin like using a brush feel like it
looks a little bit more natural with a
brush you can still build it up and it
doesn't look as dark with a brush I
think not as much comes on the brush
when you like dip it into the pot so
that's why you have to kind of dip in a
little bit more and build it up and I'm
kind of just pressing and swiping it
into my skin just so it blends nicely
but look at that I like a brush better I
feel like it looks much more flawless -
thumbs up so far I really like that
that's awesome so again as the
Maybelline Dream matte
juice and I'm actually liking the color
I think my chest just isn't as dark as
the rest of my body but this is matching
as long as I blended it down my neck and
it looks really good it's not like a dry
matte but it definitely is more of like
a satin matte finish so awesome super
excite about that so far and we hope we
don't ruin it with concealer but have
tried this one out and I did not like it
it's the Neutrogena Healthy Skin three
and one concealer for eyes and this when
I put it on with my foundation liked it
blending it out it was starting to blend
out really sheer and then it also
altered my foundation like it moved my
foundation around which was super weird
so I'm not a fan of this guy this is
what it looks like so I'm going to use
this flower Beauty concealer today this
is a shade bc one there you are okay I'm
just gonna put this underneath my eyes
like I normally do first I'm going to
start with my under eyes to just see how
it blends and then I'm gonna go and put
in the t-zone like I do with the rest of
my concealers and again I'm going to
take that elf sponge on what I owe is
super light and this elf sponge is nice
but just not getting like it's not tiny
enough to get right under my eye I feel
like I can see some of my redness
peeking through and not a huge fan of
that not a huge fan I'm going to try
blending out the other side with a
Beauty Blender see if maybe that helps
it fills a little bit thicker but it's
like not a thick concealer you know what
I'm saying maybe not like the maybe
blender is blending it a little bit more
but it is still showing my redness like
moving the foundation on my cheeks so
whenever that happens I usually just
going with a foundation brush like
whatever I used and blend it out not
terrible honestly it doesn't look
terrible at all feel like if you don't
have redness like I do you would like
this a lot more because it does cover
really
and it really brightens then again
because I got a lighter shade on but it
does brighten really well and I feel
like it looks nice on skin especially
down the center of the face I think
right now on camera it's not picking up
the redness that's right here but
there's a little bit peeking through
just because my rosacea is really bright
but we're going to go ahead and move on
to another flower beauty product and
this is D powder up loose powder and it
has really big packaging for a little
bit of product that's okay and it also
comes with a sponge as you guys saw and
I'm just going to lift this up with some
tweezers it has a safety seal on it and
just be careful taking the seal off this
might pop out and all that loose powder
will come at you not make this a
terrible mess shall we not a terrible
mess and we're just going to tip it a
couple times to get some powder I'm
going to tap it this is a shade lo1 by
the way so there's a product right there
I'm going to use the Beauty Blender to
set underneath my eyes you know I kind
of like this shade because it's not a
super translucent powder which I know
some translucent powders obviously
they're gonna be kind of brightening
under the eye and a little bit more of a
white look this is like a peachy tone
peachy yellow I would say like that
color I think once I dust it away it's
gonna be really pretty
so brows we're gonna use this elf brow
pencil in the shade I think it's taupe
this is like the only one they had comes
with a spoolie and the product on the
other side y'all I saw that that that
powder went so deep into my nose that
like it's in my soul right now the shade
looks like it's gonna matter so we'll
see
I'll be the first to tell you I'm not a
huge fan of pencil brow products because
I can never seem to get my brows to look
the way I want them to look but this is
applying really well I just I can never
get my shape right you know what I'm
saying
sprout was always my good bra like why
why is this always my good bro
everything's so much easier on this side
shape is so much easier this is a really
creamy product I don't know I'm really
digging I'm digging the color actually
really like this I think this is great
easy pencil to work with and I don't
feel like it pulled out any of my brow
hairs sometimes I have a problem with
that with certain high-end products but
this is just so easy it glides over the
brows and it's just easy to work with
and it's easy to belén
out so this is great I really really
like it I am going to set it with an
honest Asya brow gel so when I use all
as the time because it just lines up my
brows and helps it match my hair a
little bit more so now it's time to dust
away the baking that we did and I'm just
gonna use a duo fiber brush I love this
one from MUA which is also from the
drugstore I purchased another one which
I need to start using I really like the
powder I think it looks so nice on the
skin like you oh it looks so good let me
move on to bronzer I have two bronzers I
have this Neutrogena Healthy Skin blends
bronzer and then as Physicians Formula
bronzer which I think I'm going to
contour with and I do have a light
contour blush brush here but I'm going
to use a bigger brush for this powder
just so I can bronze the face really
nicely this is a shade 30 sunkissed I
think this is the only shade that they
have I'm going to first just do the tops
my forehead to get a feel for what the
product looks like my foreheads always
my like test spots getting more of like
a natural bronze glow which I'm diggin
which is why it's called Sunkist cuz it
looks like your Sunkist I get it okay so
I like this just gives a really nice
matte tan look to the skin and I'm
diggin it diggin it this is gonna be
used a lot so now I'm going to go in
with this mu a double-ended contour and
highlighter brush
oh it's a contour highlighter brush this
sides supposed to be highlighter to this
side specific contour normally don't
like to contour this kind of stuff I
like to contour with brushes that have
this tip so I can get a nice precise
line but will do as they want you to do
it going to use the Physicians Formula
bronzer and it's just the multicolor
bronzer I don't know if it has a
specific name just tap my brush in there
and lightly go on my cheeks
whoa so pigmented I'm barely touching my
face Oh what use this as a nose contour
I would strictly use it for my face but
I actually like that I think that looks
really nice this is good I would even
use this as an eyeshadow since it is
kind of that dark mid-tone Brown I mean
you could obviously dip your brush into
different colors in this but I would
swirl it all around and use it as a
crease shade and I think it would be
fabulous and now I do I have I don't
have a blush what is wrong with me so
I'm just gonna go in with the blush
that's right by me this is a Tarte
risque blush no supposed to be all
drugstore look but this is the only
thing I have in front of me right now
it's gonna lightly put that on my cheeks
but a highlight I'm gonna use the wet
wild a boozy brunch highlighter and she
pretty I'm excited so when I squash this
this is definitely more like a golden
highlight so I'm just gonna get my shirt
ohh-ho-ho oh my
Lanta stunning uh okay so now we're
going to do is try these mua makeup
academy lip products I don't know which
one I want to go for thinking nude
because it's so smoky but we'll just do
nude so this is the mua makeup academy
liquid lipstick in 205 nude these have a
minty smell
and they're like a cream if anything I'm
probably gonna top this lip color off
with a gloss because it's really
accentuating my dryness like in the
center of my lips a little bit chapped
you think I'll take like a drugstore
gloss to it and I'll let you guys know
what that is it was so far I'm really
liking this makeup look I'm loving the
powder like the face products are really
winning me over right now I just love
the way my skin looks so I'm going to go
throughout my day run some errands get
my nails done I want to get a lighter
color because I'm not feeling this color
anymore but it is 331 as you can see so
I'm going to go throughout my day and
then I'll be back in a few hours to give
you guys a final update on all of these
drugstore makeup products so I just
realized I didn't finish my lower lash
line so we're gonna do it right now I
was taking photos and I was like why
just look like I'm nothing all my lower
lash line and then I'm like oh I get it
I have nothing on pairs so we're going
to take this NYC 24-hour waterproof
eyeliner and put this on our lower
waterline see how black that is it's
insane so I'm just going to take this
Brown and the quad and smoke this out
underneath my lower lashes add some
extra smokiness would you guys believe
that this is like my daytime look then
I'm going to take the waterproof side of
this elf mascara duo the only thing is
in like and twisting one while trying to
solve the other has the same exact brush
okay now we are finally done we're gonna
go throughout the day and run some
errands hey guys so I'm back looking
shiny as always always happens to me so
I'm gonna give you guys a quick rundown
on how everything wore what I like what
I don't like and just to let you guys
know it is now 12 23rd I would give you
guys an update and let you know my
thoughts on everything that I tried
today pretty much I loved almost
everything everything lasted really well
the one thing I specifically do not like
the liquid lipstick from the mua makeup
academy in number 205 nude the formula
just felt so gross on my lips oh by the
way got my nails done do you like them I
took
after about two hours and put a gloss on
because I was like this is not working
this is looking absolutely terrible so I
do not like the formula of this it's
like a thicker liquid lipstick that
dries down but like accentuates
everything that might be wrong with your
lips I don't know just weird so I didn't
like that I did love this powder I felt
like I said everything so well I did
also like the foundation and I'm pretty
sure yeah the highlighter is still going
strong so everything on the face is
pretty much going well even though I am
shiny
I have only blotted twice and it's been
hot I've been outside running errands
and let's see if I can blot now oh also
the concealer did not crease I actually
like the concealer I think it's really
good I will continue to use it since it
is drugstore and I did like it at first
I wasn't too sure about it but I just
like the way it's set with the
foundation and everything and with the
powder on top it he just looked so great
I absolutely love a foundation now I
think this is one of my new favorite
drugstore foundations because it lasted
for so long I love the way I felt in my
skin it didn't feel heavy and I feel
like it minimized the look of my pores
it was so nice now my eyeshadow is
starting to crease just a little bit but
honestly for a drugstore eyeshadow
primer this is not bad at all like it
lasted all day in the heat I have such
oily eyelids even though it did crease a
little bit kind of went up a little bit
more doesn't look as blended it's not a
terrible product so if you have more dry
lids or just normal eyelids you might
like this give very oily eyelids you
probably won't be able to get away
wearing your I show for as long just
because the oil will eventually kind of
seep through and add a little glassiness
to your lid and I did like the MUA
palettes the eyeshadow palette we used a
couple shades from there but the main
star of the show was this l'oreal paris
french biscuit quad which i did like i
just want to try these out with a
glitter glue because this wasn't as
glittery on my lid there is some glitter
on my eyes right now but it's not as
intense as I wish it was and these did
blend out very well
I loved the brown shade in here that's
probably gonna be like
my new go-to shade because it's a very
warm tone Brown obsessed some of my
favorites and I love shaped like this as
well I'm the neutrals kind of girl and
honestly I did like the elf sponge I
need to keep trying it out to see if I
like it with other products like other
foundations and things like that because
maybe it was this foundation that it
just wasn't blending out that well with
this flat surface I did prefer this with
a brush but I will continue to use it
and I'll give you guys an update in my
August hits and misses which is where
I'm gonna be updating you about a lot of
products possibly even this urban decay
foundation because you guys have been
asking me to do a review but I'm just
going back and forth with it and I can't
decide what I want to say so that's why
it's taking me so long I've had so many
of you comment to me and ask me when I'm
doing a review on this and honestly I've
just been going back and forth and then
I don't use it for a week and then I
have to use it again to refresh my
thoughts and it's just a process so I
will give you guys a full update either
in a review or it will be in my August
hits and misses
I hope you guys like this video I'm
ready to take off my makeup and just go
to bed if you did like this type of
video don't forget to give it a thumbs
up and leave a comment down below
letting me know what you liked from this
video what was your favorite thing not
