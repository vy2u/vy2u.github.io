to trying out a bunch of different
high-end makeup products they do have
quite a bit of stuff to share with you
and just some things to try out so I'm
super excited to get into it there's a
lot of space products I have a couple I
product I can't say this is going to be
like a colorful look I mean I did do a
nice blue up in my last video and then
before that I did a really pretty summer
look that's kind of light and like just
pretty we're just going to go ahead and
get started and see you what kind of
makeup look we can come up with I have
two eyeshadow palettes so I do have this
cargo I shadow palette this is the you
had me at aloha i shadow palette reminds
me a little bit of new kylie take me to
vacation i showed a palette so i'll open
it up for you so you can see but that's
like the color scheme a'right they're
very pretty don't mind my nails and then
we also have this Tarte high-performance
natural clay play based shaping palette
which this has pretty much all neutrals
in it is a heavy duty pellet so that's
the packaging and then open it up and
here are the shades so I do want to try
this out because it does have bronzers
in here as well and contour shades I did
pick up this makeup geek kryptonite
pigment which is a really pretty green
because I wanted to use green today I
even picked out this pur cosmetics
eyeliner pencil in hot line which is
really pretty green maybe I'll do a
green look I wanted to play with this
cargo one but I just I don't know if I
want to play with it today if I did play
with it I would do a purple look and I'm
just not feeling a purple look right now
and I need to stay away from blue so
I'll use this in another video let me
know what kind of look you guys want to
see with this palette I'm just going to
take the shade right here and put this
all over my lid
the next step I'm going to take the
shade journey which is this one right
here and I'm going to fluff this into my
crease as my transition shade by the way
there is a really nice mirror on this
pallet so very pretty crease shade it's
buildable warm alright now I'm going to
take the shade umber which is this one
over here just a nice deeper warm tone
color and put that in my crease as well
little blends out really well I was a
little nervous good that is really
pretty it was not expecting full-on like
intense pigment with that product all
right
this black is calling my name trying to
figure out how to do black first and
then green or green person in black to
do black first so I'm going to take the
shade onyx looks like a really intense
deep matte black I'm going to use this
Laura Mercier brush that I got in a PR
kit this is probably not going to work
out well but we're going to see damn is
black I'm going to carve out like a
liner
which is credible going to take a
blending brush and just buff that out
even use a pencil brush to do this but I
do not have a pencil brush that is clean
enough for this job now that black is
blending really well is now pigment time
I'm going to use the NYX glitter glue
because it once again I can't find
something product this is mixed glitter
glue on my lids for the makeup geek
pigment we're going to use and again
this makeup geek pigment is in the shade
kryptonite and I've never used this
color so hopefully this is like a pretty
forced green I'm kind of going for
I'm if you get small and brush like this
this is a blending brush from urban
decay I'm going to go back into that
black shade and I'm just going to fluff
this in the outer V because I don't
really want that green there comes
personals so much like hot chocolates a
can rewatch hot chocolate thank having
difficulties because that glitter glue
this area is not weighing the beloved
out very well alright so this is the eye
shadow is looking like I do think it's
pretty I think with this Tarte palette
you're just going to have to determine
do you want a very simple go-to palette
for all of your mats you're going to
have all your basic shades and contour
shades which is what they were going for
with this palette so it's just going to
up to you if you want or not I think
it's really pretty and I think the
colors are really nice but again just
took a basic palette I mean then again
if you have a all shimmer palette and
you need some maps to go along with it
this would be a good one the reason why
it's not blend is so low in my creases
it goes because of the glitter glue so
don't judge me okay now I'm going to use
the hourglass boyar waterproof liquid
liner the felt tip liner plus one fifth
see how it works
I like it's a really nice black liner
very pigmented okay not bad very very
black I still prefer the lot in London
one over this one but it is a really
nice liner ok so now we're going to move
on to face and then we'll move on and i
will do my lashes and brows and all that
in just a little bit so the first thing
i'm going to use is this Stila one-step
correct skin tone correcting and
brightening serum
I remember watching Shannon so like all
the time back in the day use this
product I was always fascinated by it
was like a really color active colour
Estes it looked like it really color
correcting her skin so I've always
wanted to try it and this is what it
looks like it just is so pretty in the
bottle doesn't it like how pretty that
lets me be in a little bit closer ok so
again this is just the corrector one
would look sooo pretty look how pretty
that looks
I'm going to love it I think I put too
much on my hand it kind of helped feels
really good like really cooling don't
know about that I mean I'm going to be
honest I'm not normally a color
corrector person I just go for full
coverage foundation but this does feel
really good on the skin and it's drying
pretty quickly so so far so good I don't
know about color piping I mean I still
see a lot of redness beso neck so we
have to do next up we have two different
foundations we have the Laura Mercier
flawless fusion ultra wear ultra long
wear foundation I can't talk to it and
then also the digimon also these you've
all she messed it to me velvet I don't
know how to say this so I'm only problem
is I don't know what shade I'm in and
each one these actually look like the
same exact shape I'm going to go with
the Laura Mercier one for now and then
when I get a little bit lighter will go
for this one so again this is the Laura
Mercier flawless fusion ultra ultra long
wear foundation in the shade golden this
is what we're going to be using today
excited I don't think I've found a Laura
Mercier foundation that actually works
for my skin it's always been more for
like dry skin I love
you know this is so sleek and pretty and
I just think it's gorgeous and I'm going
to go ahead and take a brush on one side
and if I hate it we'll do a sponge look
it okay feel like this is not welcome to
sex a Alma texture I feel like this is a
really nice color has a lot of coverage
it is drying down to more of a like
satin matte finish but it's just it's
looking a little kinky like right in
here it's kind of bunching up just a
little bit it's kind of accentuating my
texture over here as well so I'm not a
hundred percent we'll see how it looks
after we said it was powder and
everything but I think the color is very
nice okay it's drying down like matte
now just Matt there's really no glow in
my opinion I mean there's a little bit
but it's very matte and it has a little
bit of tackiness to it but it's more
dried down to kind of like a powdery
finish not too intense but just a little
bit which might be why it's accentuating
this a tiny bit more and I didn't use a
mattifying primer thank God I feel like
if I use the mattifying primer with this
would be pretty dry we'll move on to
concealer and see how it looks after we
set with powder so next up and we we
trying the Bobbi Brown instant full
cover concealer I saw this on Sephora
and I was like yes got to have my hands
on that this is in the shade sand so
that's what it looks like I'm all for
full coverage there you know so I'm
going to go ahead but is a weird
applicator this applicator this
applicator is like a rounded tip so yeah
in that weird like it's not a dosa it's
just round seems like a mousse key
formula oh I don't like this applicator
a hell are you doing with the top care
no reminds me so much of that
so for one before they change those
applicators on it my god this could be a
really great concealer but we're not
going to know it's going to take a 30
minutes to freaking do this you know I'm
not liking that applicator that
applicator suck okay let me go with my
sponge real quick so this is a pretty
goofy formula I'm going to go ahead and
blend it out on this side of my face and
just see what it looks like I'm going to
be using this flower Beauty sponge that
just got huge take Daisy's hair out
there blending out really really well
damn that's looking cakey girl the
reason why I think this is all looking
but it's like starting to kind of break
up right here do you guys see that see
how it's kind of breaking up in this
area just a little bit more in the area
where it's breaking up let's do an
applicator and I'm just going to use a
brush to blend it out let's see the
brush Hills now non-fans seen some
negatives I'm not trying to be negative
just trying to be real it's just it
looks too cakey I just I can't mess with
it so I'm just going to poke concealer I
like on top just a little bit and make
it skin weightless one I'm just going to
put this on my eyes and blend it out
this is a really nice like hydrating
concealer just feels good on the skin so
I'm just going to poke this out a little
bit above the ground ones just waiting
to dry right the naked skin just looks
so much better than this sizes I look so
caked this side looks great
okay so now I'm going to move on to it
set the face I'm going to use this juice
booty oh it's definitely not moving so
to set a face I'm going to using this
juice Beauty the organic solution light
diffusing dust in 14 sand your dough
trebs out free dried just all some good
reviews
business review go honestly no that's
not my shaker is not my shade so yeah
we're not we're not using that today so
instead I'm going to use the Kat Von D
lock-it blotting powder in the shade
medium heard good things about this so
I'm hoping I like it as well what it
looks like very cool so it's a really
nice big mirror and you get a sponge I
like that to show you medium by the way
instead this not going to bake today
especially since we already have a
pretty matte foundation on powders okay
my obsessed with it not necessarily so
I'm actually going to go back into that
Tarte palette and contour my face so I'm
going to use the shade desert right here
which a little bit more cooled down
actually might mix these two because
this one looks a little too cool tone so
I'm going to just dabble into both of
those and I'm going to contour my face
these look super pigmented just using a
BH Cosmetics brush very pigmented I like
it I don't think I'm doing this
foundation I think it's a little too
matte for me new in one's out I feel
like not not too impressed with the base
right now oh God you like the foundation
and stuff is making it so hard to blend
everything I really like those contour
shades so they blend out so well and now
I'm going to go into this Anasazi of
Beverly Hills blush trio I've been so
excited to try this this is the peachy
love this one just called my name and
they are so gorgeous knew they would be
it is so pretty through that detail
crazy and then on the inside you do have
a mirror and then your three peach tones
which I love so you're going to mix like
the first two right here to Matt one ooh
pretty peach blush I could see myself
using this all the time because I love
peachy blushes okay I can't do this list
looks like I'm like circa 2009 Casey you
guys saw my high school like I do my
makeup in high school medio a typo right
now so see hace came out with some new
highlighters there's a glow to
highlighters the packaging on these and
their new bronzers is so beautiful so
you have Munda and starburst
this is the packaging of them like how
pretty is that I love it blue then we're
going to use this one this one's my kind
of color because I know this one
in a moon dust is a little bit more
pinky this moves like a golden color and
I have swatch these and they are intense
so let's see how they look on the face
holy crap
definitely a golden highlight if you
like gold highlights oh so pretty just
blend this out though okay so I'm going
to apply some false lashes do my brows
now have any false lash or brow newbies
so I'm going to do those and then I will
be back to complete this look for you
guys okay guys you're back lashes are on
dull find some foundation I have over
here and the glue is drying I'm going to
quickly go ahead and finish up my eyes
so I'm going to take this pur cosmetics
hot line eyeliner pencil and it's just
really pretty green I love grains on
brown eyes I feel like it just really
makes them pop and look so Brown and
foresty I just love it in one of those
liners that like twists to sharpen once
in the cap pretty pretty though that's
the color I go back in with that makeup
geek pigment in a pencil brush and I'm
just going to take some that color and
I'm going to buff out that line so
that's a green on the waterline and
lower lash line I think the eyeliner is
pretty pigmented I have tried tear
cosmetic liners before and they didn't
last a long time but they weren't
terrible I don't want to show you guys I
did top this highlighter with the other
shade of the fiance highlighter so I
used starburst on my cheeks first which
is more of that golden highlight I just
found it was just a little too dark and
I just wanted it to pop a little bit so
right on top I did add moon dust which
is definitely more of a pink highlight
here you go you can see the difference
between the two so moon dust starbursts
so this one's a little extra pops and
put that right here on the center I also
put it underneath my brow and in the
inner corners also I really think we
want to say the lashes that I'm wearing
are Lily lashes now you guys know I love
Lily lashes but for some reason I've you
mikonos before but these pair are like
falling apart like when I went to take
them off see plastic to cover the little
plastic thing like this when I went to
take them off they were just like all of
the eyelashes were like falling out I
mean they're so fluffy and full that
there's enough there that you can't
really tell but so many lashes sell out
and it's just what that does is it lets
me know that they're not going to be
really reusable their dogs are laughs so
long
and I'm not rough for my lashes so very
surprised that so many of them sell out
this but I figured I'll let you guys
know that I want to move on to it
somebody is this lipstick from pretty
vulgar and they shade 0-5 look at how
pretty this packaging is so I'm going to
quickly line my lips with a lip liner
this is a Mac lip liner in edge to edge
very then with a smile I know this is in
the shade 0-5 print and proper so that's
the color it is a little more pink than
I thought it was going to be is need to
add a little warmth to the these lips
and this is fuelled by urban decay well
that was a little too much of a cool
tone now I'm just going to add a little
bit of math lip blast in this on top hey
guys so this is a completed and makeup
look I really hope you enjoy it I hope
you don't mind that I didn't change my
top because this is so comfortable I
have to say I do have a few products in
here that I really liked but this is
probably the most disappointing like
first impressions video that I've done
just because there was just a few things
that went wrong the three standout
products that I will tell you is
definitely this Tarte palette the clay
play I love the bronzers in here I love
I shadow it's a really great basic
all-around palette to have I think it's
great if you don't have too many
palettes but you won't like one staple
all matte palette and you have another
shimmer palette you want to pair with it
this would be awesome because even
sometimes the palettes and shimmers and
matte don't have all of the shades that
you need like a brow bone highlight you
know pre shade or deep matte black and
this
all of it and contour shades that are
beautiful so I love this palette I'm
definitely going to continue to use it I
think it's really useful and this will
be awesome for traveling another product
that I just really love is the Anasazi a
blush trio and peachy love I love the
shades in this I think they are
absolutely stunning highly recommend it
and the contact is just it's so nice I
really really like that and then the
last products that really stand out hits
for me where these see hace highlighters
they are really really intense really
great formula and they're really really
bright I definitely think the product
that disappointed me the most in this
video with the Bobbi Brown instant full
coverage concealer just because the
applicator sucked it didn't like the
formula it just looks really dry even
underneath my eyes right now it just
looks super dry and I'm not a fan so
this was unfortunately like the worst
thing in the video and then this wasn't
too great I'm still going to try it out
with different primers and see how I
like it this is a very matte foundation
that it's just a little too dry for me
right now so despite me as part of being
a little bit more on a disappointing
site I hope you guys still enjoy to this
video I had a lot of fun filming it and
testing out new products it's like one
of my favorite things to do so if you
like this video and don't forget to give
any thumbs up and subscribe before you
leave thank you so much for watching and
I will see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
