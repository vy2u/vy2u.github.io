gonna be trying out some new products we
don't have a full face of first
impressions but we have so much new
stuff to talk about that I'm really
excited to share with you I get like
these PR sets in bulk sometimes and a
lot of times there are things that were
I've been talked about just because
these things keep getting sent to the
wrong address I'm trying to slowly but
surely fix that but I figured I would
still share these with you guys and try
them out on camera so that's what we're
gonna do we have some k'kaw powder
contour kits which I just bought I know
I'm so late on those we have the new
huda beauty palette which is so pretty I
am so shocked that I got this in PR
honestly I'm very shocked but I'm really
excited to test it out and we just have
a bunch of different things a new
foundation concealer and all of that so
if you're interested then definitely
keep watching and don't forget to
subscribe before you leave and now that
I have all that out of the way let's
just go ahead and get started okay so
the first thing we're going to do is a
focus on eyes I'm gonna be using this
huda beauty what did she call this like
the desert palette ha desert dusk
palette so this packaging is super
pretty I like that it's a simple PR
package I mean this is just a statement
enough you know what I mean she looks
stunning on this package and it has sand
in here I think it's super super cool
though this is the outside of the
packaging the last time I use this
people said I needed to read the
directions so that's what I'm gonna do
so this is what it looks like she is
absolutely stunning here on the front
you have this overlay on the inside and
then you have a mirror which the other
one did not have so that's really cool
so it has the mirror in this one and
then a bunch of really beautiful
beautiful shades so this is the original
one you can see right there I will be
honest I have not used it too much since
I did my last review just because I
don't like keep using shimmer shades and
my fingers so I'm gonna read and see if
I have to do that with this palette so
here's what they both look like in the
difference between the two this one says
18 eyeshadows and for ready to layer
textures eight mattes Express pearls
three duochrome Swan darling glitter mix
and layer textures to create your own
look dab the toppers on the center all
over your lids for a shiny pop layer an
extra coat using your fingers for an
extreme arid
in effect apply the pure glitter all
over or line eyes with a firm flat brush
to give your like a playful hint of
shine so we're just gonna wing it if it
doesn't work with brush we use it with
our finger nice and close up that dry
shampoo my hair probably alright so the
first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
take the shade desert sand which is this
cream shade right here and I'm gonna pop
that all over the lid just to set our
primer it's like necessary for me I have
very oily eyelids and it's really good
to set your primer just so nothing
sticks in weird places and everything
just kind of glides smoothly I really
need to get back into my throwback
Throwdown series I've had so many of you
requested lately and I'm like you know
I'm miss doing that but I haven't oh I
do have a drawer full of throwback
throwdowns see I have too much stuff
over here I can't even keep track
anymore you guys remember when I used to
be obsessed with the YSL baby doll
mascara that was like my favorite I'm
getting off track okay let's move on so
I'm gonna use this shade eaten right
here I'm just gonna pop this into the
crease as my transition shade it's a
nice lighter color nothing too intense
for our transition which is nice so that
way can just fade up to the brow really
really well I want to know if you guys
have tried her rose gold palette if so
what do you think did you loved it I
needed to keep trying it like I I loved
the mattes in it
the shimmers were nice but I just never
been a fan of applying things of my
fingers but now that I'm missing a nail
it probably be easier so I'm gonna use
amethyst right here I'm just gonna throw
that into my crease cuz this color is
just looking real too pretty to not mess
with it so I'm going to take it a little
bit in the outer V throw it into my
crease okay definitely need to build it
up which isn't bad so you see like when
you go in with your first layer of
shadow it's there but you really do have
to just build it up to get that intense
pigment but once you do it is actually
so pretty and the one thing I really
like about it is it looks the exact same
like the color on your eyes as it does
in the palette I think that's really
nice I'm just hoping these blend will
now I'm going to go back in with Eden
which is that first or the second shade
that we used I'm just gonna go in and
apply that into my crease to blend out
those edges so Eden blending out that
purple does look really nice think the
two together just look stunning next I'm
gonna take this really precise brush
from Sigma this I'm gonna go in with
this one right here take some on this
brush I'm gonna throw this right below
that purple into the outer V I think it
looks really similar to the purple so
it's not looking too different so really
pretty shade I'm gonna go back in with
amethyst which is the purple we use in
the crease I'm just gonna quickly touch
this up it's looking a little choppy
I'm very lightly doing this I mean you
can kind of see the difference but it's
nothing too crazy so this is the shade
cosmos the one I cannot drop nail there
just watch a bit right there I'm
thinking this is gonna need a glitter
glue yeah it's gonna need like a
political or something I think this is
one of the ones supply the pure glitter
all over or I line eyes with a firm flat
brush to give your look okay I'm
thinking that's the glitter when she's
talking about cuz the other ones are
like really pretty Sheen's so pretty
that would look so pretty with one of
these chrome lippies ooh I think I'm
gonna use Twilight my light would be so
pretty Oliver yeah we're gonna use
Twilight so I'm gonna use this one right
here and I'm gonna use my finger for one
I'm gonna use a brush for the other I
mean he's the one that nail see I'm
never precise when I use my finger but
that is so pretty oh my god that is so
pretty okay let's see if we can apply it
with a brush I'm gonna be using the mac
242 one of my favorite flat brushes to
apply a lid color with especially loose
glitters anything like that
I mean it picks it up but I don't know
it's definitely one of those things you
need to use your fingers with and then
you could just Pat some more over top of
the brush but like when you use a brush
you're gonna get quite a bit of fallout
like I had some of it go on my eye and
it looks like it's digging into the
palate quite a bit when you use a brush
it's super pretty but it's gonna depend
on are you gonna want to do that for
your makeup you know what I mean are you
gonna want to use your fingers but I'm
gonna go back in with this one right
here and I'm gonna put a little bit more
in the outer V since we didn't take it
all over the lid I'm really just like
flicking it right in here I'm not going
into the crease anymore I'm just kind of
buffing it in that area so when you do
that it kind of gives it more of a pop
you know what I mean I you can kind of
see the difference between the kind of
peachy color the purple so I want to
hear what you guys think do you like to
apply shadows with your fingers
would you buy a palette that you have to
do that with umm I like to know what you
all think about stuff like this because
people have personal preference some
people don't like using their fingers
but I think this is really really pretty
okay so now what I'm gonna do is I'm
actually gonna go ahead and move on to
face and then we'll finish up our eyes
here in a little bit so I have two new
primers I want to try out we have one
from Dermalogica we have the Hydra blur
primer just looks like this I feel like
I've had this forever forever it just
comes in a little tube like that hmm
different large fine lines and pores
hydrate and brighten for naturally
flawless skin this lightweight
non-greasy primary minimizes the
appearance of fine lines wrinkles
mattifies against oily shine imparts a
silky smooth luminous finish to skin
that's what it looks like oh okay I was
like a little cooling sensation wow that
really did blur out my pores Wow okay so
actually I just want to try this one out
I wasn't on try out this hard candy
stick it to pores instantly blurs pour a
mattifying pour stick but I'm filming
another video after this so
I just use this in that one and now we
have a new foundation I got this in the
PR set from Becca this is the ultimate
coverage complexion cream I've heard
this is really really good we'll just go
on with tan I'm pretty sure that it's
the darkest one that I have here so
that's what we're gonna do use one side
with a brush one side with a sponge so
this is the Becca ultimate coverage
complexion cream it says a full coverage
it's good for sensitive normal dry combo
oily skin says a full coverage yet
breathable liquid foundation enriched
with high concentrations of pigment and
water achieving a coverage without the
cake conceals and perfections redness
hyperpigmentation and even texture with
this weightless liquid foundation ideal
for any skin types it's formulated with
a balance of 21% pure pigment and 22%
water which work in synergy to
completely soften the appearance of
blemishes and uneven texture okay
between this Dermalogica primer and this
I better be flawless it says you can use
a brush to blend flawlessly if you are
between Shay's choose the lighter shade
because of the formulas high pigment
concentration huh okay well I'm going
with the darker one when he's my
favorite it cosmetics heavenly luxe
brush for one side of my face and then
of course we'll do the other one with a
sponge then we'll just go in wow
holy crap let's take a little bit more
on my forehead a little bit Desco a long
way but this one like wow I do think it
looks good over texture there's a little
bit of redness peeking through here so
I'm just gonna dab a little bit more in
that area I don't know if I'm blown away
but I do think it looks nice I like the
coverage so now we're gonna use a sponge
I did two pumps and this is how much I
have left from just doing the brush so
we'll see how much you really need you
probably only need one pump which is
like unheard of for me cuz I like a lot
there's so much darker than my face
because my body is super soft hand
I feel like the sponge gives a smoother
finish yeah I like I think I like this
sponge better I think it looks a little
bit more seamless and smooth and it
applied it really quickly we still have
a little bit left on my hand so you can
probably get away with like one pump or
one and a half depending on the kind of
coverage that you need feel like I
needed less with the sponge think it
looks good um again I like this side
butter but I don't know if I'm obsessed
with it just yet so we're gonna have to
see him and set it and all that but now
we're gonna go in with this Milani
retouch and erase light lifting
concealer it conceals dark circles
imperfections all of that good stuff so
this is in the shade light I'll just add
one mark yesterday just strolling around
try and get some medicine for my hello
blister I got and I saw this and I was
like ooh so it does have a sponge on the
end we're just gonna apply that
underneath the eyes hope this looks good
cuz I just committed and do both eyes
we're gonna be super highlighter today
I'm liking this I'm not liking the
concealer I think I just I just I don't
know man I just do not like concealers
that are not full coverage I have come
to realize that it's just I need a full
coverage concealer especially if I'm
doing a full coverage foundation this is
looking like it's really emphasizing my
texture you think if you like more
medium coverage concealers you'll like
this but for me I just need that full
coverage I kind of feel like I don't
know how I feel about the foundation as
well like I just don't think this is
gonna be my kind of foundation actually
really like the Too Faced foundation I
used it a lot last week and the week
before and I really really like it
it's just been working really well for
me and I don't think I like this one
that I'm trying
more than that you know and then we're
gonna set it I'm gonna use the - face -
peach perfect powder and I'm going to
just dust this all over my face to set
so that's what the base looks like let
me know what you guys think but now we
have some k'kaw beauty contour these are
the powder contour and highlight kits
I got light and medium so this is what
they come in I'm sure you guys have seen
somebody were to use I asked you guys if
you wanted a review on this you guys
said no but I bought them so I'm gonna
include them in like a first impressions
thing so this is what they come in
actually like this packaging I don't
know I feel I like the noise I think
that's just a satisfaction thing for me
but some people I know I don't like it I
just I love the noise on him and then it
looks like this in like a sealed package
like you would do to all you meats so
you do get the dual ended brush and then
the big contour powder I did not try the
cream contour sticks because I was not
spending that kind of money on something
I know I don't use all the time I was
good and I waited and I'm happy I did
because these were right after it and I
knew I just I don't know I didn't want
to buy them so here's the packaging a
very smooth matte nude package which is
really cool I actually like the feeling
of it and then it looks the exact same
on the inside and then there's the back
whoa people aren't kidding when they say
these are freaking huge
these are ginormous now the reason I
have these late is because I'm not very
good at like sitting online waiting for
things to come up and like new launches
to happen I only do that for specific
things I'm gonna try this out I have
seen a few reviews and some of them look
really good which is why I bought these
so this one is the light which I'm
thinking I'm gonna be because this looks
pretty dark and then I guess I'll go
ahead and show you the
I am one as well something about it just
sounds so good okay so I open the medium
one and also and they look really
similar so this is the medium this is
the light the medium is just a tad bit
deeper and then in the medium you have
more of a yellow tone highlight whereas
in the light you have more of that pink
tone I'm still gonna use the light one
because I'm a little scared to go in
with a medium one with that really
intense orange shade I'm gonna use the
brush I've been so interested to see how
this feels and it feels really good so
we'll see how it applies I'm going to
use this one for bronzer and I'm gonna
go with the orange no other shade to
describe it but I'm gonna go in with
this one right here
Abdo I'll do one side of my face of this
brush we'll see how it works
okay so that doesn't look too bad
the brush is not doing a bad job either
not bad it doesn't look as orange on my
skin I am going to use my Soho brush
which is this one right here so little
drops tour brush I'm going to go in okay
I think I like using my own brushes a
little bit more for the bronzer part I
will say that's good I know how they
work definitely it does have like a
really really really warm tint to it
which I don't know if I like I think
it's just a little too it's just a
little too warm but I feel like it looks
okay on the skin I don't think it looks
bad I'm gonna definitely shape the face
now we're gonna use this ashy tone and
we're gonna just contour our cheeks I
would use I'm going to use the other
side of this we can just use this to
contour because it's a little bit more
rounded and it just have like a little
point at the end I feel like I like I
look like I lost 10 pounds okay I don't
think it looks bad even if I don't use
the warm shading here this is really
nice and if I like these which I've seen
Nicki use them on Kim the reason why I
even bought these palettes cuz I watched
nikkietutorials put it on Kim Kardashian
and then these highlights were popping
and I was like I need that even if I
just use it for this and that I think
it's worth the money because the pans
are so freaking big I do feel like the
brush is okay I just wish she had like a
smaller like I wish she had this end a
little bit smaller so that way this
could be used for contour I feel like
been this for highlights just a little
too big it's just too big of an end so
it needs to be shrunk a little bit and
we would be good to go so now I'm just
gonna pop on some blush this is lorac
technicolor color a little bit of color
to our cheeks this is a really pretty
shade I used to use this all the time so
for highlight I'm gonna be using it this
Smashbox precise highlighter brush I
really like this and I'm gonna use one
on each side of my face so on one side
I'm gonna use this color guys that is
really pretty
Wow okay wait I was not put down the
other side that is so pretty I don't
know man people hate all over her
palettes but that's not an ugly
highlighter so this one is more of the
pink tone which I normally don't go for
pink tone highlighters this doesn't look
bad at all it's not too pink I think
they're really pretty you could even mix
the two and create your own the
highlights have a really good texture to
them they're not going to emphasize
texture really bad or anything like that
because they're a very smooth powder so
even though the bronzer is definitely a
little too warm for my liking I think
everything else looks pretty good I want
to try out one more thing though let's
see this is the luminous glow Lancome
highlighter actually just got today it
looks so intense when i swatched it and
i really want to put this like on my
cheeks oh look at Lancome okay if I
didn't have texture emphasized before
now I definitely do wow at Lancome
highlighter is not playing super intense
y'all need to go check out these Lancome
highlighters I don't know how long
they're out for but it's pretty freakin
good okay next thing I'm gonna do is I
think I'm gonna skip lashes today just
because I really want to try out this
Lancome monster big most oh babe
most of your big it says big is the new
black so this is the color black okay so
I've curled my lashes and I'm gonna go
in with this mascara we're gonna see
this gives you really pretty fluttery
lashes it's not as dramatic as intent
and intense as the essence one but it
still gives you some volume and makes it
look like you're wearing like wispy
lashes see with without not bad that
essence one kind of gives me everything
I want but if you're really into
high-end mascaras and you don't mind
spending the money on it then I would
suggest purchasing this one cuz
really nice but the essence like for
dollar one does it for me so this is the
look we have going so far I'm really
feeling it surprised I have no lashes on
but I'm going to quickly touch up my
lower lash line highlight my brow and
then we'll be back and we're gonna try
out a liquid chrome lippy that is brand
new
okay so now what I'm gonna do is use
this ciate liquid chrome duochrome
lip lacquer and they shade luna now I
will say first up this is really pretty
but it looks really similar to the huda
beauty one where's that co-opted a just
looks a little bit more gold so here is
the huda beauty here's the ciate see
I'll take it's definitely a little bit
more gold and who knows a little bit
more purple I go in with this milk
makeup this is new from milk makeup as
well this is the lip color in the shade
cream and we just put this all over my
lips first we'll see how this looks
ooh super creamy and then I'm gonna put
this the ought a one over top Wow
I think it is really pretty but I don't
get that intent chrome look with it like
I do the huda beauty won but I think it
is a really nice gloss it's nothing too
intense okay so this is the completed
look a few things that stand out to me
that I do not like is the foundation
kind of like right off the bat I do not
like the concealer very much those are
two that I'm just like not feeling it I
just don't I don't like my skin right
now I do like the contour in the k'kaw
Beauty palette I don't like the bronzer
and I do like the highlights another
highlight I really like is this Lancome
one I think it looks so really really
pretty
I like the huda beauty eyeshadow palette
I think it's really nice as well also
I'm not sure about this Dermalogica
primer just yet I did blow out my pores
really nicely but I'm gonna see how I
like it with like my favorite
foundations so I will keep you guys
updated on that yeah I think the
standout product for me was definitely
the eyeshadow and the highlighters I
think they looked really pretty on the
skin yeah let me know what you guys
thought down below in the comments what
are you gonna try out do you have any of
these products do you like them love
