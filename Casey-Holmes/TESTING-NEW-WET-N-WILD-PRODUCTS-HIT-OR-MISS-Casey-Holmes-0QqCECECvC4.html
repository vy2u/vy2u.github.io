very exciting video we have some new wet
wild products to test out for you guys I
have all of these new Pro wet and wild
blush brushes I have all of the new wet
wild brushes I am so excited to try them
out these are like their pro brush line
which is pretty fancy pretty sure I got
every single one they all look really
amazing I can't wait to touch them they
just came in I ran upstairs took a quick
little body shower so my hair's a mess
and I wanted to film this for you guys
so I also do have the cushion
foundations that we're going to test out
today just to do a first impression on
you have concealer I think this one's
gonna be too dark for my under eyes so
if that's the case I actually have this
covergirl one I figured I could try and
then we have some new eyeshadow pallete
super exciting stuff from went wild I
can't wait to share it with you guys
today if you guys aren't subscribed
already be sure to hit that subscribe
button down below and if you want to see
how all these new wet and wild products
work and if they're good let's just go
ahead and get started
all right so I've already promised eyes
I'm like really antsy to dig into these
products that I've been waiting on them
forever like I order these I believe the
day after Christmas and I just got them
I have this little eyeshadow palette
that looks like a nice staple it's
called hooked on vinyl this is the color
icon eyes shadow quad this is really
pretty just kind of has your staple
colors in there and then these two are
so pretty this one does have a broken
shade right here but I'm not gonna give
it back because I don't feel like
waiting on a new one but this is the not
a basic peach color icon pellets as well
and on the back it kind of tells you
where you can put these different shades
for different looks then I have another
one of those palettes in Rose a in the
air which just looks so pretty
see these warm time shades yeah we're
just gonna go ahead and get started I
have a few of these wet mile Pro
blending brushes I will put the list of
prices down below in the description box
for you guys if you're interested we
have this fluffy blending brush and then
we also have a tapered blending brush we
also have the dome eyeshadow brush so
these are most of the eye shadow brushes
that I have I have this other small one
but it's the precision flat brush like
for your
I have another smaller brush but this is
the precision flat brush for your face
so figured I would just use this for my
face and just see how it works because
it is super it's like a flat top kabuki
in a way it will be incorporating these
with any other brushes that we need it
doesn't feel super crazy good it feels
okay it feels like it'll work it only
has the numbers on here once you take
that packaging off so it's the p20 brush
so I just got both of them open and they
don't I thought when I first looked at
these and they open from the bottom but
they definitely open from the side there
is no mirror it's just these ones right
here first thing I'm gonna do is take
the rose' in the air and I'm gonna use
this shade right here and we are just
going to it's quite a bit of fallout but
that's okay it's really affordable and
we're going to put this all over the lid
flower icon shadows from what mild have
always been really good so I'm excited
to use these brush seems like it's doing
pretty well so far I'm just gonna use
this as my all-over lid color all right
took no time at all to do that going
back into the rose a 1 it says
transition transition I'm gonna go with
this one because it's very very pretty
that max shade that they discontinued
but they're probably bringing back I had
it too everybody loved it this that's
what this one reminds me of so I'm gonna
take this on the brush and I'm going to
pull in this into my crease so we're
just gonna blend and I'm adding just a
little bit more like a little bit lower
in the crease just so it's nice
pigmented I'm gonna lightly bring the
brush up and fade out that line that
looks pretty good bringing it all the
way in the inner corner as well I'm just
doing circular motions again really
building that color in the crease and
then I will bring it up to fade it
towards the brow I also think these
brushes are really sleek and nice they
have a is it rose gold these are kind of
like a rose gold I don't know I don't
know I'm not like a rose gold expert but
they look rose gold to me really pretty
and they have like
tapered end so I love that because you
can store them really easily sometimes
if brushes have a thick in there like a
pain in the butt to store so I know
that's a first world problem but it
happens okay now what I want to do is I
actually want to go into this not a
basic peach and take this really hello
really warm tone shade right here I'm
gonna use this other brush which is the
wet and wild tapered blending brush
this one's just more tapered not as like
fluffy as a other one okay so the number
on here is P 15 this is what it looks
like again taking that really pretty
orange wow do you see that I'm gonna put
this right and then the crease I'm not
going above that transition shade I like
this has a lot of bristles but it's not
too tightly packed like they're tight
enough to where they're a really great
shape and they just fit right in the
socket I like this brush a lot I will
definitely be using this I will use this
for majority of like cut creases
blending them out putting specific
colors into my crease you have a lot of
control but it's still blending and
that's what I love about I'm going back
into the Rose a in the air palette yes
and I'm gonna use this color and I'm
gonna bring this one right here in the
outer V and blend it about halfway on
look at that color
my gosh that is so pretty for a
drugstore eyeshadow you guys what a new
world that is so pretty
okay I'm gonna go back in with this
fluffy brush and I'm actually gonna take
the really intense orange that we used
and use this to really focus this
directly into that crease as well since
this other brush that we have has most
of that light from a Gentoo shade on it
so I'm going to take this and I'm going
to lightly blend the edges of that color
we just put on and again focusing it
like right into the crease where we put
that orange first I like that a lot okay
last thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to use this really deep matte right here
and I'm just going to put this right
here
just steeping it up a bit nothing too
crazy and then I am gonna go back into
the shade real quick and just touch up
that lid oh this is what I shot it's
looking like so far now I'm gonna go
into the Rose a in the air and I'm gonna
use this shade right here I'm just gonna
use one of my own brushes because these
two a pretty dirty and I don't have
another eyeshadow brush to use with this
product so I'm gonna use a 242 by Mac
one of my favorite brushes again going
into this shade right here or should I
keep this all matte
I don't know this shimmery color doesn't
look too hot surprise doesn't look
terrible it's not as shimmery and like
reflective as I prefer then again taking
it this brush right here going to very
lightly blend the two together okay so
that is what the eyes look like right
now I definitely love the matte shades I
think the matte shades are really
beautiful the shimmer so far not
necessarily my favorite now I'm gonna
use this wet and wild skinny eyeliner
it's really small is the mega slim
skinny tip eyeliner in black I do really
like the skinny mascara so we will see
how I like this oh my god it is so you
see how tiny that is just that's big
okay so I'm gonna go in it's really
black
in this eyeliner is definitely for
people who want a really thin line but
you can't create a thicker line with it
it's very pigmented as you can see I
just don't I feel like I don't like it
cuz it's so short so it's kind of hard
to just like flick your winged liner I
do like that it's so small because it is
so precise
I wouldn't necessarily use this to
create the full wing but if I wanted to
give the wing like a nice little flick
right out the end something really nice
and pointing or get really close to the
inner corner I would use this product I
think it is really nice very pigmented
easy work with not terrible will same
eyeliner is not so even so I'm gonna fix
that so just apply my lashes eyelash
glue still drying and all of that I did
prime my face I used the Smashbox primer
water and then the sokham soaked and
Glory and then the soap and glory one
heck of a blot primer as well we are
moving on to new foundations this is the
mega cushion foundation for my wild
spf15 as it contains natural coconut
derivative it's a liquid foundation in a
cushion compact luminous lightweight and
buildable hydrating formula have two
shades here I have new beige and buff
beige and we are gonna see I think I'm
gonna be more buff beige because I'm
pretty self tan right now though the way
this sponge feels on the back of it does
something to me and I don't like it
there's a mirror in here has a little
film on it I'll just leave it there for
now and then it does have the cover
protector so we're just gonna open that
up and I feel like this is gonna be my
shade so we'll just go with it see how
it works I'm gonna be honest with you
I'm not using this product something
about I am really weird about the way
stuff feels like if it doesn't feel like
sometimes certain things can make my
teeth hurt it's the weirdest thing I
know even if my hands were really dry
some things just really just don't work
for me so I'm not gonna use that I'm
gonna use my own sponge this is the Real
Techniques sponge and if I find I don't
really like it then I'll go to their
sponge and try it I'll just I'll just
try okay so I'm gonna dip my sponge in
here get some product out looks like a
really good color and we're just going
to apply this to this
feels really good with this sponge in
this foundation feels nice smells good -
it smells clean so I did use a
mattifying primer this is pretty dang
light for me that's gonna be darker even
on the packaging it looks pretty dark
but all right well bronze but it has
pretty good coverage so far I'm just
gonna do one side my face first and then
I'm going to show you guys before and
after and then what I'm gonna do is do
the other side kind of let this dry a
little bit and then go on top of it to
see if we can build it up so this sides
without this sides with I think it looks
really good - the color being off nude
beige is definitely lighter than this
one so I'm just gonna stick with this
but I think it looks really good
definitely is very luminous which makes
me nervous having oily skin but we'll
see how it looks when I said it and all
that kind of stuff we are very very very
dewy we look like the highlight that I
put on my body right now I'm gonna see
if I can build up on this cheek really
quickly I need to also get more on my
nose my nose is like one of the hardest
places for me to get good coverage
because I don't know why but sometimes
foundations just don't want to cover my
nose I look like with the foundation
right now that I've been sweating my
life away I look like this wet highlight
look at this that is very shiny
okay so it's really not covering up my
redness that well I would so I will say
it's more of like a medium to full
coverage just depending on stuff that
you have on your skin it could be full
coverage for you depending on what you
need to be covered but I feel like the
more you try to build it up the less
coverage you get I wouldn't build it up
that's just me this is definitely off
the back not something I would use in
the summer time because it is so dewy
but what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
put some concealer on I'm gonna actually
use this new concealer from a covergirl
because I really feel like that wet
Labuan is just gonna be way too dark
ones in the shade fair and it's a new
one with vitamins E B 3 and B 5 has
really nice packaging I know this is a
wedding mom video but it's all drugstore
so so we're just gonna twist this sucker
up
and we're just gonna want to do one eye
first it just wants me what it looks
like I low-key love brush tip
applicators there's just something about
them that makes it so easy to apply
taking the other side of sponges just
wanted to foundation with I'm gonna do
this side with a sponge dip light is
concealing pretty far down to help
conceal some of that redness it's nice
like it's covering and it's really
brightening but I just need a little bit
more coverage especially because my
redness is peeking through right here so
I am gonna take torch tape tape in
light/medium honey and I'm just gonna
put it right here and blend that okay so
there we go we have more coverage now
covering up that redness now I'm gonna
try the covergirl concealer with a brush
I'm gonna use this precision consumer
foundation brush from my mouth for
concealer this is really cool it has
like a dip in it can you guys see that
there's like a little dip right in here
very soft brush these look really nice
yeah this is like pokey poke my eye out
yeah I don't really like the cover girl
concealer for me that's another reason
why I don't use cushion foundations like
cuz I like full coverage I like it to
stay and sometimes when you start
blending things on top of the other
things just start moving and like the
foundations moving this concealer is a
mess so I'm going to take torchic tape
and just do the other side as well
I'm actually gonna take my peach perfect
powder from Too Faced my Real Techniques
sponge I'm using again so I'm gonna take
this precision Pro flat brush from my
mouth and I'm actually gonna hit the
inner corners real quick on my eyes
where the concealer is I think that's
what this brush will be perfect for
getting right in there next up I'm going
in with this large powder brush went
wild so far I'm really liking these
brushes from went wild the foundation
ones okay I don't think it's gonna be
great
maybe if I don't know I don't I don't
think this one's gonna be ideal for me
but I will try it out one more time with
a foundation instead of concealer like I
said this is a powder brush it's like a
tapered powder brush
and I'm just going to do I like this I
like this brush I like the shape of it I
even think it'd be really great for
bronzer oh right moving on I am gonna
bronze the skin I'm actually going to
what one do I want to use I mean they're
gonna use the powder brush or this brush
to bronze my skin this one's the blush
brush it's a pretty big blush brush yeah
I think I'll use this one for blush
okay I'm gonna use this brush again the
powder one for bronzer i'm using the
Neutrogena Healthy Skin this grabs
product there's gonna bronze the cheeks
take it up to the forehead I like this
for bronzer it's precise okay so now
we're gonna do is take the precision a
setting brush and I'm gonna use this to
contour to use this t.j.maxx contour
palette I'm gonna use my same color I've
been using it on the brush and contour
this is a good powder but this brush
just really diffuse to that and blended
it out oh I love where that contour
looks right there like it's pretty
dramatic but that's why I love it so now
we're gonna go in with the blush brush
and we're gonna use the Burt's Bees
blush in the shade Bear Peach I would
almost use this one for foundation
instead of blush again you can use
brushes for whatever you want okay so
that's good I don't mind it for blush it
wouldn't be something I would want to
use with a super pigmented blush like be
honest Asya ones because it would grab
too much product but it is really nice
and now I'm going back into this palette
and I'm going to use the setting brush
or I'm sorry the tapered highlighting
brush which looks really really nice
it's not like one of those flimsy ones
with barely any bristles on it this
looks like a really good brush and I'm
going to dip into my highlight
okay it's alright but it doesn't pick up
as much product as I want it to so you
got to keep going back into bigger
highlight palette but it's nice gets the
job done I will see I kind of like this
brush better because it's not like a
line this brush see on stalls everyone
kind of diffuses it out
I might even use this for eyeshadow just
like all over lid colors won't be using
this for highlight but I will be using
it for probably eyeshadows I have two
more brushes left and I have this a flat
contour brush which we did not use today
but I do want to see I get a liner brush
or something unless not I've done all
the brushes if I make it like a liner
eyebrow brush okay so this is what the
contour brush looks like I think it's
pretty standard contour brush the
wet-and-wild pro brushes they do have
like finger indents which is nice
I'm going to just see what it looks like
I'm not going anywhere so we'll just see
how this works this is a pretty stiff
product dang
that's a pretty sharp contour I feel
like it does apply a lot of product
right when you press it down so you
really got to work to blend it but I do
think I prefer this one because it gives
you a dramatic contour it really blends
it out nicely where it's not like super
dark right here and then like right now
it's looking really dark everywhere but
that way it's not super dark here and
not really blended up a little bit
towards that cheekbone also have another
brush that I'm quickly going to show to
you guys this is the dome pencil I brush
I use these kind of brushes for
underneath my eyes to blend out color so
that's what I'm gonna do today you go
into the Rose a in the air quad take
that transition shade that I loved so
much
this one right here with that pencil
brush and want to blend that out
I think it works I think it looks pretty
good it's doing its job it's good I
think it worked what do you guys think I
have a really smoky under-eye right now
I need to put on some liner I'm gonna
finish up my liner and my brows and my
lips and I'll be back to wrap up this
video for you guys ok so my makeup is
done the lip that I have on is these
Smashbox a liquid lip and out loud but
anyway so I'm gonna quickly tell you
guys what I think about everything so
far I think this is an okay foundation I
mean right now my skin does look pretty
dang good I have to say let me look at
this up close again because I was
looking at my face up close when I was
doing my eyeliner like fixing it and my
pores look really good yeah like my skin
texture looks really good I don't know
I'm gonna continue to try it out and let
you guys know what I think I'm not 100%
yet and I also want to see how it wears
and the colors are too light so I need
to like not be s self tan next time then
I do like the mattes in these palettes I
think they are great the shimmer shades
not so much so far um but I do really
like the matte colors I will continue to
use these products I do really like the
skinny liner especially when I was
cleaning up my liner I really liked
using this because it was super precise
and just cleaning up that line so well I
like it because the felt tip is so small
for that reason like I didn't like it in
the beginning at first because the felt
tip was so small but now I really like
it because when a felt tip is longer and
you're trying just to cover up your lash
glue sometimes that longer felt tip can
kind of go everywhere and then you have
to continue to make your line bigger and
bigger did not do that
it was super precise and I'm definitely
gonna continue to use this product I
think it is great
and I did not like the covergirl
concealer I know this wasn't about them
but they were in here so it's about them
and I didn't really like this concealer
at all I just it's not my favourites
it's hard for me to find new concealers
that I'm obsessed with
and then for the most part all the
brushes I really did enjoy especially
the eyeshadow brushes I'm gonna purchase
more of those love these face brushes I
think these are awesome for drugstore
brushes I really like these so far I
really do like the face brushes and I'm
still kind of on the fence about this
one foundation I will try this out with
a foundation and let you guys know what
I think everything else I really did
like so is my like first impressions on
the new wet and wild products that I
received
I did purchase them but I wanted to do a
full video for you guys I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
watching and I will see you all in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
