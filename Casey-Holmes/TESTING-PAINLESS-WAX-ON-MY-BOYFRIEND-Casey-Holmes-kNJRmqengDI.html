today I brought Davis back on we haven't
done a video in a while but we purchased
this wonder wax like almost ear ago and
we did it mainly because I wanted to try
on Davis he has more hair than I do and
I've never heard of like painless hair
removal especially when it's a wax cuz
it's just not this is not painless the
figure we would try this out on Davis
today see how it works and see if it
actually like rips out the hair it looks
so effortless on her you see how she's
just like gliding it up so you can see
on her it's like really nice and just
happy-go-lucky so hopefully this is
super easy to apply it's supposed to
last up to eight weeks
no strips you only have sticks to apply
it with and it's for all skin types
and it says sticks to hair not skin and
you can use it for your legs arms
resilient underarms face but for Davis
we're going to be doing his leg not do
it too much we'll just do a couple
strips on him and see how it goes he
wants to do the top of his thigh which I
told him I've had my legs waxed before
and the top of the thigh is definitely
the worst so it's gonna be painless but
it's probably gonna hurt okay ready all
right so we're downstairs ready to heat
this up so we'll show you what comes in
it this have your three large sticks the
wax it's only 5 ounces I don't know if
that's 5 ounces of the wax or like how
big this cup is but there's not that
much product did you have an easy waxing
guide you also get three small ones
these are like for your brows or
whatever then you have finishing wipes
which you just put on your skin just to
calm it down so it's microwave we put on
high for 2 minutes so after this heats
up obviously you want to get it all
melted
so do 30 second increments if it's not
melted enough
then you're going to want it to sit for
three minutes before you put it on your
skin at least that's what this little
thing says we're gonna do just hot
really well gonna have a longer than two
minutes are you feeling scared
are we scared you let me do a little bit
of your brow right no it's not gonna
hurt and it's just gonna be your unibrow
so we took it out again just looking
like it's the top part that's like not
melting enough probably not going for
like what another two minutes come on
let me just go see him get waxed come on
I can smell it do you smell it yeah
we're gonna wait just a couple minutes
enough for me to go put this camera on a
tripod and then we'll start the waxing
process like I said we have three of
these big sticks and then we have other
little six or downstairs woman you do um
and we have one little stick so you sure
you want to try it no you boppers I'm so
much easier I'm okay you got a damn good
roads okay we're down our wax where you
want it just like right here hmm
good start from the top and go down
keep fine it does it
Rose quit whenever we have to wax this
or like rip it off we have to rip it
this way yeah
that's what I said it said put on this
way and rip off backwards I couldn't
feel it pulling anytime I move it pulls
a hair either over here over here this
is not gonna be happy
can I surrender now no no no at least
you got a little bit up right here yeah
this one's trying to work just breathe
yourself and everything yeah we got this
Oh tell me nervous ready yep three I'm
gonna give great Oh three two one
you ripped like five pairs this is
coming up okay ready yep three just do
it don't count go this is what the hair
looks like painless I don't know but it
did pull out the hair which I show you
guys
you walk camera you can see right there
oh my god it feels so weird it's so
smooth okay sue I know it doesn't hurt
it was like a band-aid yeah that's how
it is I hurt when you did it you should
still let me didn't really your eyebrow
yes
wait no yeah yeah I said yeah
this one will be better because if you
don't meet countdown I want it hurt
worse when you were like peeling it up
and pulling one here at a time but when
you went fast because when you have to
peel it that one little section yeah
okay so we're gonna take the little
finishing wipes we're gonna go ahead
just put one on this side okay you ready
she's pretty dry all right and I have to
flick up a little bit so this is the
worst part yep all right ready yep not
counting down that one hurt it's so
severe you though oh my gosh mm-hmm
there's a couple that it didn't get but
for the most part it got it so here's
the other hair another wax strip oh no
what I'm gonna do the center of his brow
so how you feeling I feel naked on my
legs every time you rub over me with
your pants it feels like weird oh yeah
because you've never felt like that
feeling of your skin their skin really
that pulled them out but it didn't pull
out enough but it pulled out a lot man
you need to put these things are so much
more hair than I thought looking all
that looks good though but I could see
some you've had your own choice right
hi my leg my arms so you can compare to
anyone yeah
no bad did Palani my ears over here oh
yeah
your hairs were just so short that
they're sticking straight into it yeah
it went out quite a bit of my arm here
but there's still some left like you can
see like right in here okay guys so that
is it for this video thanks babe for
doing it how do you feel you feel easy
breezy beautiful yeah mm-hmm it was
right then I didn't stick to my skin
yeah that's right
it just pulled it grab the hairs it
pulled him says it wasn't like pulling a
band-aid off where it sticks to the skin
itself definitely less I would say less
messy than the wax strips I've done wax
trips before and they don't pull out
your hairs but these pulled out
everything everything so I hope you
