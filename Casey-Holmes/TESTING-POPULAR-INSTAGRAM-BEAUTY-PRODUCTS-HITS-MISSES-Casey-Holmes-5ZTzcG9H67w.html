trying out some more Instagram hyped
products now waiting on one prior to
come in but I might make that a
dedicated video because we're sell but I
figured I would test out all the
that everybody is talking about going to
see if it's good if it's bad we have
this 3d or 3d three-second brow has the
suit of beauty highlighter palette RCM a
what is the no color powder we've got
some Kylie cosmetics in here and then I
also have a dubious palette this is the
nubian palette and I've heard nothing
but great things about this so I'm
excited to test it out a lot of you seem
to really like my last Instagram hyped
up video so maybe I'll do these like
once a month we'll see what's coming out
what's hot when people are talking about
if I can get my hands on it we'll just
see if we can do this once a month so if
you like this video I definitely give it
a thumbs up also don't forget to
subscribe before you leave and let's
just go ahead and try these products all
right so the first thing we're in a trot
is the Nubian by dubious Holly I've
never tried anything from this brand
before but I have heard a ton people say
it's amazing they have great quality
eyeshadows so I'm always down to try new
I shadow palette and of course I went
with like a really good color palette
for this one but I do want to say when I
got this package it was packaged so nice
like it was covered in bubble wrap and
then you open this up and it also still
has the boa wrap so I think that's
amazing I didn't wash the colors or
anything I just opened it up and saw it
and I was like you know what that's
really nice this is what it looks like
it is so when neon green is not picking
up on camera but I love the packaging I
think it's nice it is cardboard just
looks like this it is cardboard doesn't
have a mirror lightweight so I imagine
this is great to travel with you open it
up it has this plastic sheet and then
you have the colors so here is the
colors in the palette I think it is
really pretty you have pretty much
everything to create a look the only
thing I'm not seeing is a matte
highlight shade or something for all
over the lids I'm just going to use my
translucent powder but if you want to
mention that to you guys that it does
not have
in this palace so we're just going to
move on I'm going to take my pokey
translucent powder which just looks like
this
and I'm going to go ahead and set my lid
you guys should let me know down below
if there's any other Instagram products
whenever this video goes up that you
want to see because I will pick it up
for you guys and test it out just let me
know down below I feel like you're just
so hard to keep up with the trends on
Instagram I feel like there's new stuff
pop another raising all day alright so
the first shade I'm going to take is
this one right here it's a really pretty
orange color and I'm going to throw this
into what my crease really nice
transition shade
so we're just doing that in there super
pretty blended really well and I like
this color of course I like this color
it's warm
I believe this palette wasn't that
expensive either I can't remember since
as long as I bought it it's just been
sitting here in my room I will leave it
in the video so you guys can check it
out all right I kind of want to see what
these glitter shades look like real
quick like so damn that name you stop
talking oh my god these are
gorgeous these are super look at this
 I'm going to go in with this shade
right here row this one into the crease
right below the first day we put on yeah
I didn't know and I'm going to what I'm
going to take actually we might do
something a little different
okay this is what we're going to do it
we're going to do a cut crease I'm going
to take a brush lighting and I'm going
to go into this matte Brown and I'm
going to carve out my crease I'm just
going to go I'm going to but my natural
crease just to kind of make my eyes look
a little bit more big I'm going to get
all the way in here okay I'm going to go
with this shade real quick on top of it
and see what it looks like I'm in a
little bit of a darker cut
that party going on now move out okay
taking a clean blending brush I'm just
going to go over those lines just want
to see how well they blend out without
any extra product on top I think they're
blending out nicely I'm going to take a
little bit of that first shaver you is
going here and blend a little warmer
okay so is what working with so far I am
going to go in with a pencil brush and
I'm going to take the shade again really
boom and go over it real quick so you
can I take this one right here I'm going
to play with this shade and this shade
right here so I'm going to take this one
and put this all over my lid with a mac
242 brush again I'm not going in with a
Too Faced glitter glue because I want to
see how this performs on its own all
right so that is what it looks like
without any glitter glue I think the
pigmentation looks really nice
definitely there I'm going to take my
tape off kind of going to add like a
little bit of balloon to this look on
the lower lash line so that was super
easy the shadows blend really really
well I'm not done with this yet but so
far I'm just going to put it aside so
I'm going to quickly do my primer
foundation and concealer and then we'll
come back I'll do oh wait no let's try
this three second brow real quick okay
well I have no face makeup on we'll try
this out this is a three second eyebrows
stamp it's perfect natural looking
eyebrows in seconds and this adds CLTV
just press in place three seconds is all
it takes
blends with most hair and skin tones so
you get one compact which has the
product inside two structured arch
stamps and into soft arch stamps okay so
here are the eyebrow stamp these are the
soft ones and then be more defined ones
are in
this little thing Oh so whichever one
you like you could just attach it to the
back and take it with you wherever you
want to go because here your brows
stance you can put whatever one you in
what in there and then on the other side
you have the product maybe I trying to
open up the whole bow but it's only one
side that pops open but that is what you
have there and you have the mirror so
I'm going to go with the dramatic one
and let me read this real quick and see
though I've got this one even though
like the tip of this does look really
weird okay this is this is not how my
brow is going to go I need my brow to go
like that a little bit more straight but
it's okay the small circular motion
gently gently rub the stamp to the
powder until a sponge is sufficiently
coated with brow powder so I'm just
going to do my little for this world and
it's completely covered then it's as
well looking into the mirror align this
things with your eyebrow and press
firmly with even pressure for three
seconds the harder you press the darker
the eyebrow will be pulled a sample way
to reveal your eyebrows bubble box you
may need to touch up probably step I
need a mirror close to me I'm going to
just line it up press it oh this doesn't
feel too good
maybe if I did a little lower see the
shape of this one it's just I'm not
feeling it I'm not feeling it I look
confused right now and I feel like if
someone who didn't know how do i rouse
it is on they would look confused all
day long it just doesn't work let's see
what the other shape looks like on my
other brow and press firmly you know
that was not bad I like this shape way
better oh that's not good oh wow so it
does away pretty easily this cool me no
I like this shape better but I feel like
it's a little bit of a pain to work with
the brow powder does just away quickly
like if you have a tendency to touch
your eyebrows throughout the day this is
going to rub off completely so now I'm
going to do is I'm going to do my
foundation it can see
and I'm going to come back on show you
guys this setting powder alright guys so
I'm back I did a little bit of liner
which I'm letting dry and then I do my
concealer for liner I was trying so hard
to use the Stila clutters but they
didn't want to act as eyeliner today it
was a hole ended up using in the Urban
Decay moon dust eyeshadow I love these
this is in the shade chemtrails but for
now we're go ahead and try our next hype
dope Instagram product you guys want to
know feels good and I've been seeing
this around for so long like what a year
and a half or something and this is the
RCM a no color powder supposedly this is
like the bee's knees the good you
know we're going to try it out the only
thing that sucks is the packaging it is
just a pop up top and then your says to
dust it on whatever I guess so I have a
towel below like what is this packaging
just some of that off I think the
packaging is wasteful I'm going to go
ahead and bake underneath the eyes still
using this from my last Instagram mmm
you buy a video think it's so good kinda
looking good looks like a regular powder
we'll have to see like if I guess this
the way we'll take my foundation or
anything but so far so good
so anybody talk about this anymore I
guess it's still good and I still like
it because so far is looking really nice
a really smooth powder if you're
wondering what foundation I use I just
used the Natasha Jenner no full coverage
foundation really really nice oh this is
looking really pretty I'm going to go
ahead and destroy this fake no need to
leave it over 15 minutes so you've got
time for that today looks like it has a
really beautiful soft finish moving on
to Kylie cosmetics this is the first
thing that I bought for her from her
since she came out with that really warm
toned palette I did not want to get a
ton of stuff from her vacation
collection I do really want the wet set
today am I going to sit online and try
to catch it when it's himself probably
not that's the only thing about her
cosmetics like I didn't even pick this
up until a few days after it launched
think your packaging is really cute for
the collection I like this font so this
is what the packaging looks like really
pretty the same as the box this does
have a nice little flap in here you have
a mirror bronzer and a highlighter
bronzor looks like the color of my skin
tones okay so going to take my
favourites and you cash it brush the
really light bronzer bronze not bronze
I'm not seeing a difference here it can
see a little bit of color but it's not
the kind of bronze that I like it's just
it's very faint and it's not really warm
or any but the bronzer I'm not impressed
with to be honest with you I think it's
just way too light so if your my skin
tone or darker you're not going to want
to get this I think it might work for
medium but definitely for fair skin
tones I'm kind of disappointed that this
is so light and it's the only shade she
came out with for like a combo like this
I think she should have came out with a
few more shades with a darker bronzer
but I mean if you're more fair you'll
probably really like this I'm going to
go in with my Marc Jacobs tantastic
bronzer now there were bronzed up I'm
just going to add a little a bit of
blush for blush I'm just going to throw
on benefit California because it really
lays the color nice coral Sheen so I'm
going to use the highlight hotness on
one side my face and on the other side
I'm going to use this to de beautÃ© e a
3d highlighter palette
she looks oh I didn't even really her on
her eyeshadows reflective girl that is
gorgeous I got a lot of heat in my last
Instagram video because I said I didn't
like her the eyeshadows in that one
palette the textured palette I didn't
say they were horrible I just don't like
applying on shadowing fingers and let's
be honest I just looked at colors and
eyeshadow palettes and I don't read
directions I just go for it so I knew
applying them with a finger was better
but I mean I just wish you could use a
brush you know what I mean so she has
like a little guide right here which i
think is really nice for people who want
to get into highlighting or just getting
into highlighted here are your shade
very pretty this is the golden sands
edition these are bigger spans so on the
side I'm going to use Kylie
going to use my Anasazi brush this is in
the shade glow up like I said I really
wanted her wet set but they sold out so
quickly all right so that's the
highlights a pretty golden highlight so
now I'm going to go into this palette
and I'm going to take this shade right
here into the Beauty palette I'm going
to use a different brush is a bare
minerals brush by the way it came in
like I set with a bronzer a long time
ago so that's why it has it see if you
look right here this is not emphasizing
and this is this type they kind of look
the same bill thing like same shade so
I'm kind of feeling the huda beauty one
more to be honest with you I brought it
pretty forward on my cheek and it's not
emphasizing as bad as a lot of metallic
highlighters like this can get alright
so we're going to stop highlighting now
but I think it's cool that you could
wait apply fajita under cheekbones to
add dimension and shape so this we're
going to do I'm going to add this
underneath it does underneath cheekbones
and this is like a highlight under
cheekbones to add dimension and shape
with without you know a little nervous
about that because this is a highlight
palette but you can't tell okay you can
you could see the highlight down here
and if you own both of these palettes I
mean mmm
I feel like such a negative Nancy kind
of a pilot I would pass on just because
I was really looking towards that
bronzer and it's not what I expected and
I feel like I have a highlighter already
that looks like the one in the palette
if I could do it over I would pass on it
because I was really excited about the
bronzer and I didn't know it was that
light if you like the huda beauty
palette I think the formula is really
pretty I love these to highlight shades
I don't know if I would use this shade
right here in the palette for a blush
because they do have larger pores and
texture and things like this tend to
emphasize this is really pretty I just
don't think I would use as a contour I
personally love a matte contour but you
could also if you wanted more of a
bronzey highlight you can mix it in with
this one if you want a war of a pink
tone highlight you can also mix it this
it's kind of like a more customizable
palette so I do like this I don't think
it's bad and the packaging is really
pretty so the shade I'm going to use
next is this one right here Jesus as my
brow bone highlight actually I'm going
to go in with this shade right here and
I really want to say I know that the
liner ran on my lashes it looks terrible
but I didn't know until after I was done
filming so don't highlight underneath my
brow it dips up anyway so this is a
pretty glittery shade normally I like to
use my highlight shades under my brow to
match the highlight but I really want to
play with this real quick
it's so pretty
then the next thing I'm going to do is
actually take this urban decay this is
the jean-michel collaboration to happen
and I'm going to put this on my lower
lashes I used it the other pencil that I
came in this collab when I did a video
on it and I love the orange one as well
I mean he's the first shade that we use
this orange color and I'm going to blend
out the edges of that blue blue is
really making my eyes look a little bit
lighter so pretty so I'm going to take
it a shade that I use for my highlight
with a pencil brush as well swirl it in
there and I'm going to put this in the
inner corner this tear duct area I love
that color
and I really love this palette as well
all the colors are blending amazingly I
would have done like a really intense
smoky eye in this video but I know a lot
of you were kind of over the smokey eye
but I could see myself really doing
something with his red copper the matte
shades it's just such a great color I
love the way it looks so I really like
this one and then we're going to go in
it with this Kylie gloss
so again this is the Kylie contour the
kylie jenner super glitter gloss so this
is in the shade glitz and this looks
like it's going to kind of match the
eyeshadow or someone whoa I think it's
pretty but too light on its own it
definitely is pretty which I mean if
you're going to go for a glitter gloss
it's going to be a little bit gritty
let's try to put a lipstick down first
well it's like leaving my lips super
glittery so I'm going to go in with fuel
which was around me over 2k make it heat
collection I really like this color so
pretty now I'm going to put this in more
of the center of my lips
okay so that's what looks like on top I
think it's pretty from far away kind of
looks like a normal gloss to me I feel
like of course you really can't see the
glitter you can feel them but you can't
see them I mean it's really shiny it's
really pretty but this is a makeup look
at that I created today so that is it
for this video I really hope you guys
enjoyed it I feel like it was super long
hopefully I can condense this down but
if you did like it definitely give it a
thumbs up and let me know down below in
the comments what you want to see next
and I will see you all in my next video
