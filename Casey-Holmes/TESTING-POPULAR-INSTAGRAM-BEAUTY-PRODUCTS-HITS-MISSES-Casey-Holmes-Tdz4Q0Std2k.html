today we are really trying out a bunch
of Instagram height products now these
are products that I have seen all over
Instagram and a lot of you recommended
to me when I asked you like why
Instagram products do you think I should
include this video and fit a lot of
popular stuff we're trying Instagram bra
today we're going to see if it works I
actually have two of them so like you
know if it's good I need to color so
have new two black pajamas tried the
nude one it would say video is going to
be on if you're new don't get subscribe
and let me know down below in the
comments what you want to see next so if
you want to see me try all of these
Instagram hyped products and see if
they're actually good products or not
then Alexis go ahead and get started
okay so the first thing I want to try is
just Bravo but my highlight is kind of
like looking a little quicker right here
right if you're wondering what I glow my
shoulders and like my decollete with its
the market Jacob do you coconut drop and
then also on my shoulders I add a little
bit of this Tarte fill down sprinkle
face and body glitter gorgeous so
anyways I'm going to try this out I
believe this with 19.99 I will include
the price in this video I'm just going
to go ahead and loose filming this right
here so I'm taking it all the way down
to the end
I'm a 36d and personally it's hard for
me to find like sticky bras that
actually work actually purchased one
from Belk not to on go I can't get happy
double D one though and that's it
perfectly it's been like my go-to sticky
bra but I don't really try to stop
because everybody from small movies
today movies love this at least from
what I've seen have seen some horror
stories on some sticky bra so just be
careful trying these out if you get a
rash or anything like that obviously
don't wear it again let you know in the
comments how my boobs feel after this so
it does come with the two plastic sheets
if you run out of this you can always
use plastic wraps to line your sticky
bra with but always keep these so you
can put them back on the stick your bra
looks like this place looks ways to cure
the moment I have so this little these
levels are you nipples obviously this is
what the shirt looks like without the
sticky bra I'm not going to show you me
putting on
a PG channel Yunnan thing but this is
what it looks like with no sticky bra
this top is from Lulu's by the way it is
so cute so again this is without the
sticky bra and I will be right back
to show you it looks like with the
sticky bra on okay so I'm back and this
is what it looks like with the sticky
bra on I feel like I'm a little crooked
here this boob is bigger than that zoom
so that's just how the cookie crumbles
around here I will say it does give you
lots of volume and it really does a lift
I mean I don't mind it so I feel like my
cleavage is just a little off obviously
because this one's bigger so I have more
volume here than this one maybe I just
need to pull this one over a little bit
more let's see if I can do that right
now
I will say it feels super secure like we
are locked in doesn't feel like it goes
anywhere whenever you move so I actually
like it and I have to take it on and off
just a couple times on this side of my
boob since this smaller and like push it
back more I could get a nice lift out of
this one as well I actually liked it and
I didn't think I would like the size of
it and if you have a larger chest I do
have some under boob right here so I
just keep that in mind if you are
wearing a thinner sure you will be able
to see the sticky bra but if you have
something like this or like a nice dress
that you want to wear it with you should
be good to go it's two thumbs up for me
the next thing we're going to try out is
the CUDA Beauty eyeshadow palette again
this is the rose gold edition I have
seen this everywhere I have had my
Allen's pop for a really long time I
think it is just so beautiful like the
colors and everything I just think it is
really stunning and I've seen a lot of
mixed reviews on it so I'm interested to
see what I think about it you guys know
I love seeing Natasha Jenna not sunset
palette like all of her eyeshadow
palettes that's like the one brand I
will spend a lot of money on because I
just love those eyeshadows I know
they're going to be amazing the price of
this is $65 so it is more affordable
than the etosha Jeannot one but we'll
have to see what the quality is like I
will say the packaging is gorgeous I
love this see-through I love it you can
see all the colors so I want you
know that I am working on getting a zoom
lens actually have one right here
they're so nice but I need to find an
adapter for this camera so I bought one
it should be here next week and I will
be zooming you guys in more very very
soon so just stay tuned I am working on
it I promise
but first I'm going to do is pick the
color Bay which is an ice cream shade
and I'm going to put this all over my
lid okay so this is what Bay looks like
it's more of a yellow toned cream color
it's pretty nice
yes and now I'm going to take sandalwood
and put this into my crease I have a new
lip product so I need to try to
coordinate with how pretty this is
this is Bella from listent I'm going to
go over the shade henna right here and
I'm going to put this into the crease oh
that is a really pretty color this is a
perfect color for people who want to try
red toned eyeshadows for a little bit
scared I feel like everything's blending
pretty well I don't think this is a bad
palette I can't remember it's been so
long since I seen a review on this
palette and I can't remember what people
disliked about it but so far everything
is going pretty well we're just going to
do something fairly easy vernie's one of
these relation reach age right here
because you know I can't stay away from
these kind of shade you know okay now
I'm going to go in with man-eater
because this is a really pretty color
and then put this from the outer V all
the way to about mid lid this same brush
I will say man-eater in this color kind
of look similar on the lid I mean this
one's a little bit more bright but I
still feel like they're pretty similar
okay so and now I'm going to take the
color black truffle with another
blending brush I will say I have the
Natasha de Nonna blackest black
eyeshadow I used that the very first
time I went back to wear makeup again
after moving and it was so easy to work
with crazy I mean the best blush I've
ever so
so I you know be really good I'm just
going to take it and we put it right
here in the outer V I like it I think
it's a nice black not too and ten but
definitely deepens up the outer V and
I'm going to take man-eater again which
is that really pretty in-between shade
and I'm just going to blend the edges I
feel like I definitely have to blend a
lot but then again I am doing the very
intense smoky eye so it's always just
about blending blend blend moving on
we're going to take the shimmer eye
shadows and I'm first going to try them
without a glitter glue just cuz I want
to see what they you know how they wear
how they apply but if it doesn't work
out I will go back in with a glitter
glue so I'm going to take this shade
rose gold and just go along with the
thing we have going on which is pretty
ooh pretty chunky I mean you guys anyhow
chunky it is what it looks like right
there I don't know can you see like the
chunks of glitter just sitting there
it's not like a all over payment and
I've dip my brush in here quite a few
times and it's not coating the brush
like you could still see the bristles of
the brush maybe this is the part where
people don't like the palette yeah
that's gotta be it whew that's not good
at all okay your finger picks up more
but it's still fairly chunky like I'm
really not digging into it oh yeah your
finger is like a way to go but I have
these long as nails now and I like don't
know how to function fingers are the way
to go if you don't have nails you're
probably able to dig into it but the
case for me I don't think a glitter glue
is going to help this because it doesn't
even deposit on the brush really well
and then we're going to call it quits on
this one I'll touch up my lower lash
line when we end the video but for now I
think that is enough so the next thing
we're going to do is we're just going to
go ahead and move on to face I have
these are solid unicorn s's skin
enhancing antioxidant serum and
this innovative solution acts as a
dual-purpose theorem which infuses us
can with beneficial skincare while
prepping it for leering moisturizer or
makeup application it contains four
super fruit extracts rich in
antioxidants and packed with vitamin C
which helps make the skin appear visibly
younger and healthy looking apply to
clean place before moisturizer mainly
used as a primer before makeup
application okay this does use does a
primer that we're going to do today I
have seen this absolutely everywhere and
I was just so interested to try it out I
know this girl is like huge on Instagram
I forget her name but her and her
husband created this brand and it's just
huge I think it's awesome that there's
before whoo so pretty I'm going to do a
sheet is because I want short videos
like that smells like something from my
childhood smells really really good
feels really good too we're going to see
how it wears for application I am just
going to go ahead and go in with
foundation because I feel like this made
my skin feel really hydrated and nice
miss kind of matte as well so I'm going
to go in with the hourglass vanish
foundation stick now try this a few
times with my regular primers and things
like that and say I'm not the biggest
fan of this foundation I've tried it
twice I figure it for this video I would
try it one more time because I want to
try it on camera yet so this what was
like I'm sure you guys bussiness
everywhere this is D stick foundation
from them I don't know why this is like
my stuff on the top it is this is a
shade warm beige hopefully this will be
okay for me I'm going to do half of my
face really quick we're going to see the
difference in the two sides so
resembling this in
okay this is looking good now I feel
like this color is pretty much
everything there's a little try believe
it or not for my oily skin this is a
little dry but that's what half of my
face looks like this actually looks
better than the first time I ever tried
it
I'm actually really shocked right now I
did not think I was going to like the
first application and I didn't like it
when I first tried it because it was
like cleaning the dry patches and
separating but right now this is looking
really good
and it has been allow since I tried so
many skin care is like helping a lot
look at that I'm not going to use a
beauty blender with this because already
know I'm not going to like it so we're
just going to use a brush because it's
easier to blend out and it gives a
better finish is it the first olive oil
is it skin care also a lot people ask me
why I have hair on my face it's peach
fuzz you know it's natural I don't
really care if I have peach fuzz on my
face I know some people like wax it
shave it off you know that's totally
fine sometimes I shaved my too but to me
so thank you you know everybody has it I
cannot believe how good that looks right
now and I'm just freshly self tanned by
the way and warm beige is a great color
for me I use loving tan self-care and
ultra dark that was good
so now what I'm going to do is I'm going
to go ahead what do I have left I have
this our supposed to do this by doing
this takes forever yeah 45 minutes I'm
not doing that
are you so now we're going to be using
the cake and baked sponge for our
concealer and today to the fade it says
to wettest with water and so completely
saturate squeeze me out excessively way
to pick up liquid or powder makeup
products at the top or bottom flat edge
and applied to conceal or bake so I'm
just going to apply my concealer like I
normally do and then blend it out with
that sponge because I'm going to use a
sponge that's how I'm going to use it
you know what I mean
all right I think I like to feel
but then yeah so it feels it looks like
this it's not a bouncy I would say as
the Beautyblender
but we're just going to take this side
like it says to and blend this out one
thing I will say is in close that lower
lashline I like that you can sharpen out
your eyeshadow and clean that up and you
can also come through here and get into
the creases of your nose and contour so
even though it's not as bouncy as we
blend are actually really liked it so
I'm going to be using the cinema secrets
Pro Cosmetics ultra Lucent setting
powder to banquets today we're going to
just follow where we put all that
concealer feel like with the sponge is
looking a little chunky like the powder
is a little chunky but it's applying it
so that's all that matters you just kind
of to tap it out a little bit more and
now I'm going to use the Wonder brow
I've had this forever now I even got it
in the shade Burnett when I was
brunettes
that's how long ago I've had it but it
looks like it will be okay for my blonde
hair but whenever I was a complete stage
one step solution to eyebrow shape and
hair loss it's exclusive perma fixed
technology and a hair fiber complex
creates the perfect brow in less than
two minutes that will last you until you
decide to take it off it contains an
exclusive blend of hairlike fibers
combined with specifically treated
pigments designed to fasten onto skin
and hair so it does come with Li you
don't have a brush with this other than
the brush that actually comes on it
let's just see how you're supposed to
apply this start by using one Dubrow to
fill in the sparse fog with short
feathery strokes apply in the direction
of hair growth you can start by applying
just two problem areas or over the
entire brow for fuller more defined
looking brow first I'm going to apply it
with the brush but for the most part I'm
probably going to go in with my actual
brush to apply it miss that a nice shape
brow that I like
it's not turning out as bad as I thought
I'm more nervous about the inner corner
right here okay actually this thing is
not bad since while it's still wet
you're supposed to brush through it
which is what I did so I guess it just
dries down and then it's permanent not
permanent but you know last all day so
far I really like this product I think
it's awesome and the fact that it
actually is pretty easy to apply with
this brush on here give it a two thumbs
up some because I find that really
intriguing and it does come with really
if you want it yeah these are starting
really dry down I'm digging my face
makeup today look at that I can't this
is such a good video something's bound
to go wrong right I am so impressed what
else do I have to dry anything else is
good and these the last thing that I
have to try for you guys is is lip tint
so I'm going to go ahead and finish my
face makeup off camera and then I will
be back to share with you at this
Lifton's product okay guys so I'm back
to finish up this video and try out
listen I've heard so many things about
Lipson not necessarily like details of
what it does I just have had so many of
you asked me to try this out but I did
get mine off of Amazon and I also got
this lip stand oops
remover I don't know I guess it's like
really well wearing so I figured I would
get this too
basically it's a long lasting liquid lip
color and it says to apply in one
direction beginning with the outside
corner of the mouth apply three layers
letting each dry three to five seconds
finished with your favorite lipstick
gloss so I'm guessing this is a matte
shade I could be wrong so I really don't
mind how self-tan my hands are I tried
out a new self tanner before I used
loving tan last night and it was a mess
just going to go in if there's apply
from outside corner of the mouth
so it's really cooling like very cooling
when I apply it and breathe in I kind of
feel like I'm breathing in chemicals
like fro I feel like I'm inhaling so
we're feeling very dry can you guys see
how dry that looks right in there a lot
of look looks good but topless looks
very dry I stopped it to just because I
really I don't know it's making me feel
a little uneasy like feeling that sit in
the back of my throat I get really
self-conscious about my stores closing
I'm split sticking my throat closing and
things like that so when I feel like I
can feel something in the back of my
throat just freaks me out so that's just
me I mean you could be different this is
so sticky it's definitely been like 3 to
5 seconds I'm going to just top it with
this mariah carey's gloss in dream lover
I'm not obsessed with the color okay
guys so that is everything for this
video I have to say I really enjoyed all
the products - the lipstick the lips is
kind of like not my stain just the scent
of it I think
I'm not enjoying let me know what you
like from lip scents leave it down below
in the comments do you like the lip
gloss better do you like the liquid lips
definitely let me know your experience
with that I do really like the Wonder
brow I think it looks great I also
really enjoyed the far Sally unicorn
drop I did not think I was gonna like
this I think it actually works really
great as a primer and it sinks into the
skin really quickly and it feels very
hydrating and it smells so good loving
the Instagram bra I mean my booth has
some volume as well as this kick fake
sponge I think this is awesome and
blended everything out so easily
his foundation look at my skin this
foundation is insane and I told you guys
earlier that I've tried this before but
honestly I did not think I was going to
like this like I for sure thought I was
going to try for a third time and be
like you and like it as always but I
really enjoyed it especially with this
brush it does accentuate pores and makes
me look flawless it's full coverage so
so far
see a new winner I will keep you guys
updated the sort of beauty palette I
really do like the mattes in this I feel
like everything because Blin just a
little bit better for the price I think
these colors right here necessarily
aren't the best but they're a little too
chunky and difficult to work with if
you're going to use it I recommend using
your fingers with it I don't even think
a glitter glue would help just because
so chunky and it's even hard to get it
on the brush I'm not impressed with
these and Mac's are really nicely like I
said I wish they blend a little bit
better but I do like the palette I think
the palette is really pretty the shimmer
shades definitely could use some work I
think that needs to be worked on but
all-in-all I love play my makeup look I
will have a pins comment down below
letting you know a final thought on
these products that I thought so
Instagram brawl gave me a rash if the
foundation broke up and look gross if
the eyeshadow crease I will let you guys
know everything down below in that
comment as well as if the brow product
stayed in place I hope you guys enjoyed
this video thank you so much for
watching it was probably a long one but
I had so much fun doing this and if you
want me to continue to do Instagram
memory by it videos give this video a
thumbs up and I will keep doing them for
you and yeah I will see you guys in my
next video bye
