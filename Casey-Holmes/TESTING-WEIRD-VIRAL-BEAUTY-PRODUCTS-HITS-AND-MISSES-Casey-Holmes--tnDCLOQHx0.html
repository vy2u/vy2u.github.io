trying some weird hyped up products some
of the stuff went viral on Instagram
Facebook things like that and I
petticoat which is waiting on you
I've had this collection of stuff for a
while now and I figured I would go ahead
and do a full video on all the products
that I have we have things like this
mask that looks very very creepy we also
have the eye candy eyeliner stencils to
try out we have the peel off makeup
saying huda beauty metallic lip products
this baby slit thing and then the last
thing that I'm most excited about and
the Venus silk expert intense post light
hair removal system this is sent me
literally so long ago this is not
sponsored at all just like a PR package
and I was like I love laser hair removal
I currently get laser on my underarms in
bikini area so I want to see how this
felt it felt the same so if you're
interested in seeing how some of these
viral products work then definitely keep
watching and don't forget to subscribe
before you leave let's go ahead and get
started with this video okay so we're
just going to start with this rubber
mask clear skin lover so this is by dr.
jart and I love dr. jart I have used a
few of their masks before and I really
see a difference with the masks that I
use I'm excited to try this is it
supposed to be on for 30 to 40 minutes
so we're also going to do baby feet
while we do this one okay so I just got
this one packet it's a single-use packet
oh and it's only $12 so that's not bad
at all this is a different kind of mess
because it is a two-step process
directions day after cleansing which
I've already done so step one on to skin
to nourish open step two rubber mask
pouch carefully remove the film place
the mask on your face and gently press
leave on the 15th or 20th Oh what oh go
we can't leave Elmer's okay so this
little thing right here I thought it was
like 30 to 40 minutes because it does it
right here on the packaging but on here
it says you can leave on 15 to 20
minutes which is good that's good go
ahead and take the step one this is what
it looks like right here at first I
thought this is like a sensor so this
just looks like a little jelly
star is not completely full like you
don't get this whole thing full of
products and just keep that in mind but
you can see that kind of jelly texture
right there oh so we're just going to
massage this all over feels really good
on the skin feels very cooling and I
didn't apply any moisturizer or anything
because I know as no apply this mask and
my face feels super dry so I didn't use
all of the product in the ten there's
just a little bit left we did just say
you can use on your neck chest arms I'm
just gonna do that now so now we're
going to open up step two so it's
definitely a pretty thick mass you can
see how thick it is right there
oh my bad let me wow so cooling like
that kind of makes me cold whew it feels
so good so like it's staying on really
well too so far so it's got that they
leave it on 15 20 minutes so around
11:40 we'll take it off just hoping this
stays on my face normally I like lay
flat like this in my bed and let it all
work but we're going to go ahead and try
this baby foot product with stuff like
this always read the precautions you
never know and what I plan on doing is
I'm filming this video on a Friday and
I'm going to still update you guys like
I'm going to have I'm not just this
video next Sunday so if I seem extra
peeling or whatever I'll whip my blog
camera out and show you guys and let you
know the bottoms of my feet are super
super dry right now
they're always very dry so I have two
socks that don't match because I don't
waste much time matching my socks so I
got this off of Amazon I will leave all
the prices in this video needs to see
videos on this all the time
lavender scented I love lavender so give
me all the lavender so here's the inside
like picture instructions which is very
nice structure manual little packet here
we hear the booties after cleansing put
the plastic booties around each ankle
using the enclosed pieces of adhesive
tape maybe the tape is on the booty ah
there it is okay so the booties are just
plastic
like this and then trying to be careful
here this is just to cut the top okay
then you just open it is very it's like
filled with products we're just going to
gloss our see it's cold everything all
my values Corina fold excess material
around your ankle and secure babies that
gel soft it takes for more comfortable
use it's pretty sick tape too so just
going to fold this here and I'm just
going to go ahead and talk on out me too
much oh yeah that's a comfy fit oh yeah
OOP so chilly
I started clean and just put it on and
it helps it form whatever the whole RM
throne is one but then it forms better
cigar spots on so it says to not stand
or anything for like an hour - fine
because actually I needed to wipe my
sponges I'm sure I can trot over there
or something
remind me in 1 hour to take off baby
foot you have about 10 minutes left so
I'm going to go ahead take a quick break
let the 10 minutes go by and then we'll
come back massages and see how well it's
working ok guys so it has been a little
over 20 minutes it's been about twenty
two minutes now so I'm going to go ahead
and take this off
hi beautiful whoo and then I'm just
going to massage any extra product oh it
feels so good it actually feels so like
I told you guys before my skin felt so
be hydrating because I have any serums
or anything on like I normally do and
now this just feels so I feel plump it
feels cooling so refresh I give it two
thumbs up alright now we're going to
move on to one of the like most viral
things that I have seen on Facebook and
Instagram and that is this a face shield
it's the duracell face shield patch and
supposedly this is supposed to be like a
product that you put between your skin
and your foundation to create a barrier
so if you have acne or something or any
texture
supposed to be a little bit better for
you that way like bacteria doesn't
affect you know you're asking or
something even more so you don't really
have any acne right now but I figured I
could try it right here on my cheeks in
my chin because this is the area where I
have a little bit more texture and the
areas where if I could I wouldn't put
any product I just test about on my face
you know in different ways I just really
want to peel off my face makeup because
of this you could peel it off since it
does create that barrier very
interesting so down line off of Amazon
almost $30 and it is a Korean beauty
product it has a lot of stuff on here
it's not in English so just so you guys
know it's by far more maker it says it
can help reduce the amount of the casual
sabang produced by your skin and refresh
your tired skin okay is a tiny bottle
I'm not going to put this all over my
face and I was like that's necessary I
think it's more of a despot treatment so
it's already kind of coming out as you
guys can see so we're going to put a
dollop back here I don't know how much I
need so it's just like a clear gel very
sticky so I'm just going to take some on
my finger
I'm just going to put this on my rosacea
I do have a lot new spot here so I can
try it there as well it doesn't smell
bad just kind of smells like medication
soo goopy
here not sure how much to put on I don't
want to do like a thick layer so I'm
just doing like a thinner layer just a
little little area right here I tend to
get caked in this area so we'll see how
this looks so we're just going to go
ahead and let it dry I'm going to use
the Georgia Romani designer list
smoothing affirming a foundation as well
as power fabric I'm going to mix them
together so you can see the areas where
I put it
so here here a little bit in this area
still a little bit sticky I'm going to a
couple more seconds and then my forehead
we're just going to Pat this on I'm like
trying to be gentle don't want to like
move it around like I did on my hand
okay completely dry now I don't think
this is specifically made to help with
texture but I'm just kind of hoping it
does you can tell where it's where I put
it underneath the foundation because
it's very very shiny on this side I can
see where separation is oh ma you can
see right here kind of where I put it
like you see right in this area oh my
this matte area right here is right I
don't have any and then you go right
below there's like a line and then all
this shiny weird texture or any keep it
moving though we're just going to see
how it looks after we set everything
because I want to peel it off all right
so let's apply concealer I'm using my
regular Tarte shape tape and Maybelline
fit me
it's like aging the skin like I mean
it's a classic peel off like right there
I feel like I'm not really surprised
just because it is a peel off product I
kind of expect this to happen like if it
were to go bad this is like what I would
expect to happen it's like a super dry
finish like this area look how it's
already starting to peel up you see that
okay
what what what's going on it oh that's a
peel up all right in there oh my I mean
the forehead is going strong I don't
even know where I put that thing on my
forehead not going to do a complete full
face since I'm trying out products and
I'm probably going to wash this off just
because I'm not going I lightest if I'm
going to use Estee Lauder translucent
perfecting loose powder I've been really
enjoying this powder a lot I'm just
going to Pat this into my skin with a
fluffy brush because I have more
products to try oh my gosh what happened
look what it looks great though it's
just oh my gosh yeah I'm going to take
this off I think before I do other
products I don't think I can get as far
as bronzer and stuff with it I will say
the fun part is coming because now we
get to peel it off already starting to
peel so we'll just go off the areas that
are already peeled well
that's a solid there's a she looks so
weird
with like other products on mean it
works it creates a barrier like this
skin underneath here I mean there's a
little bit of areas where I'm kind of
like lean it looks like foundation got
in but for the most part I mean it looks
like it created a barrier lose that Wow
it feels so much better without that
stuff on what do you guys think would
you use it would you purchase it for
your acne spots I think it's a good idea
I just don't know is it practical so now
I'm going to pick up my favorite liner
this is the allotting london wing woman
a lot liquid liners assaultive liners
and I've never used a liner stencil
before it's cool it shows that you can
use like eyeshadow or whatever you want
with it so we're going to try liner on
one side eye shadow on the other this is
best
bender beauty so there's our insult but
it's called the eye candy gentle
adhesive eyeliner stencils so very cute
packaging I give them that there it is
so you can kind of see the stencil right
there I'm going to take it this is the
left right side right side this part
needs to be under my lower lash line so
we're gonna the kind of would go off of
the lower ones first so that's under my
lower lashes
no gonna come listen I'll buy a little
bit Oh No
okay just go in like that okay that
looks like it could be a good line huh
since it didn't connect all the way in
the inner corner I'm just gonna do my
regular clear line and I'll let it dry
for just a second let's peel it off whoo
that sticky that's not bad I mean you
would have to go in and clean it up but
that really isn't that bad I'm going to
try to like angle it up more this time
yeah that's definitely angled up more
okay and then I'm going to I'm not
pressing it down completely just yet
there we go that looks good oh that was
good now I'm going to take the
subculture palette just a palette that I
have right next to me and I'm going to
use and more dense brush even though
these are very intense and pigmented and
I'm going to go in with all star on the
outer part like that in there kind of
just the shadow in and then I'm going to
wipe off that brush I'm going to go in
with axis on the inner part
dust off the brush oh those two colors
though and we going to blend the two
together hopefully alright so now let's
take this off oh it's sticky cool I
think it's cool
it's definitely thicker but like look at
that line how it goes from the teal to
like the maroon shade dude that was a
little bit better a little bit more
practice you can place it in that
perfect area like this wing is much
better because it's going up more it's
just super thick right here it works I
paid with a two thumbs up I think it's
cool it's easy way to use shadow as
liner to get a different look I'm going
to keep these I'm going to use the brow
shadow I just did a full face of makeup
I took off what you guys saw I had on
earlier to move on so I'm going to show
you guys these Kuna Beauty lip strokes
so I took this packaging off but this is
the packaging it comes with like these
cute lips on it who de has like the
cutest packaging ever it is holographic
as you can see we have this shades
bujji and then we also have angelic I'm
probably going to use angelic today
since it will go my eye a little bit
better all you do is slide it out
and then you have your product so I'm
going to open these up these of it
everywhere I feel like on Instagram and
stuff that's what it looks like right
there this looks gorgeous in the package
and then you open it up this is what the
applicator looks like I really like that
I'm just watch both I've been really
into glosses lately like shimmery
glosses anything like that so it says
this is strobing metallic lip gloss
volumizing gleam sculpting shimmer
comfortable wear use a loner on top of
your favorite lip color lacquer your
lips for all of our volume and shine oh
geez angelic I love I love both of these
I think they look so pretty this one for
the summertime is just everything
let's just see what bougie looks like on
the lips I'm not going to apply a new
lip product - let's see if they look
like on there that is pigmented wow they
have a nice like sweet vanilla ish scent
but that's bougie I think it's really
pretty I'm not normally into metallic
lips but this is not bad
all I just love this color this is the
kind of color that I would I would hop
over like different matte lipsticks okay
I love it
this isn't necessarily going to look too
well oh no but I love it I love this
color if you like the one I would use
the most it's definitely angelic and
bujji is definitely more of like a
going-out I would probably even as a lip
topper this one I would wear on its own
I think it's stunning
moving on I am going to try this is the
last item we are trying which is the at
home laser hair removal I did open the
box to see the instructions and see if I
had to charge it or anything but from
what I can read you don't have to charge
it well a you don't need any self-tanner
on I do have self-tanner like around my
ankles down but not on my actual leg so
I'm going to keep it away from that area
and it's not like self-tanner that I
just applied it's like leftover I
can't get off my ankles I'm going to
keep it more on my cap area and just
like the middle part of my lower leg
because there's no self-tanner there if
you've never done laser before I would
definitely read this packet before you
even tried it out just to make sure your
skin is prepared and you're ready and
you're not going to like ruin your skin
I have dark coarse hair why I really
resort to laser I don't have my legs I
could shave them but if I get out of the
shower and it's kind of colds there
frequently you know what I'm saying that
that's why I always considered laser
actually I scheduled my next laser
appointment for the bottom half of my
legs till I remembered I had this
product and I was like okay I'm going to
hold off real quick and just try this
out it gives you a whole bunch of info
so I have different settings on it so it
tells you by your skin tone and your
hair color
what kind of settings you will need to
do and then like if you have a lighter
hair you know it's just it's not going
to show up I'm just going to get started
I'm just going to go plug it in so this
is what it looks like it comes with that
little booklet this is pretty expensive
I thought it the best beyond after they
have sent this to me because they sent
it to me and I was like oh this is so
neat I'm so excited to try it then I
looked at the prize and I was like they
said destiny you guys send that to me
you are okay I mean that's expenses but
I'll try it
and I always be a shock to people send
me like expensive things or like are you
sure you what you connect me to surprise
right here it is bigger than what I
expected to compare to an iPhone 7 plus
Oh
take it out this is what it looks like
it is fairly large you have another cord
in here they also give you a razor a
Venus razor which I don't like Venus
razors to be a hundred percent honest
with you because I do have such coarse
hair they don't necessarily shave close
enough for me so I'll probably give this
to a friend or something but they give
this to you because you need to make
sure that you shame and you're
completely free of creams anything like
that boys make sure you were nice and
freshly shaved with a fresh blade saying
get the closest shave possible because
it'll burn like a bitch otherwise after
ice plugged it into the wall it just
looks like this and it's heating up can
you hear that so it does have like a
little vent and it is heating up it is
cheaper than going and getting
professional laser done just everywhere
since it has skin sensors I want to see
how this works okay so here's my leg
none of this test self tan on white skin
tone high power setting dark skin too
low okay so I have a pretty high power
setting you guys can see how far it goes
up have a high power setting because it
says the skin tone sensors measure the
colour of your skin and set the correct
level of output and needed if your skin
is too dark for treatment of skin
sensors will detect this and prevent
Yoona from operating okay then it says
press treatment button the device will
flash and a warm sensation should be
felt if you find the treatment
uncomfortable you may reduce the light
intensity using the light intensity
button which is resting place the
treatment window formula on your skin
ensuring both sensors have skin contact
the both of the sides so both of these
light up and that's how you know it's on
your skin completely on both sides so I
can see this size lit up in this side is
too so for a gliding mode it's just
press which I'm going to do the gliding
mode so it says press and hold the
treatment button the device will begin
to flash move the device slowly
continuously from the bottom to the top
of treatment area to avoid missing areas
make sure to always keep full skin
contacts of device flashes constantly
once you've completed your first sliding
scrote lift the device off the treatment
area repeat steps 1 2 3 to the next area
all right so we are lit I'm nervous
because you're ruthless
what okay
whole Liat that's definitely like
regular okay from someone who has had
laser that does feel like it it just
like kind of popped you a little bit
that is so crazy you really gotta press
it to make sure both lights are ready
booyah every time you see a flash red
it's like a little pop but it's nothing
bad and we're just doing this bottom
half look at that still can difference
Wow so I am using a mirror just to see
if the lights are lit up on the other
side
and
whoo turn this off and I'm going to just
do one length because I'm very
interested to see if there's a
difference like in a couple days
normally I can tell within a couple days
there's difference this was the first
time that I ever had laser again I had
it professionally done it kind of just
feels like a rubber band it's just
popping a you know what I mean you think
that's so cool that they came up with
something that you can have at home
there's different safety features on
here as well to make sure that you do it
correctly so I'm going to keep you guys
updated on the baby feet saying I
Willoughby you guys throughout the week
on that as well as a laser if I notice
any difference so I will see you guys in
my little update chitchat so it is
Tuesday figured I would film an update
on this foot thing that I tried the baby
feet thing because my feet look
horrendous so I don't know how I feel
about this product just yet what day are
we on I think I did it like Friday
Saturday Sunday Monday Tuesday we're on
day four this stuff better like start
peeling off hardcore it also feels gross
like when I'm in bed and like my sheets
and everything are like grabbing the
dead skin hopefully this is just the
purging process like this is gross I
love you guys more on the foot thing
probably like it's on the seventh today
hey guys so it is Sunday and it's a
little bit longer of an update then I
was going to fry my feet but I figured I
would go ahead and show you guys um the
dead skin looking nothing remember how
they look so the dust gets off they are
really soft I mean there's some areas
that are like still pretty dry all that
dead skin after I filmed that last part
it started really falling off thank gosh
did work I give it that not like it
didn't work because it definitely did
you guys saw all the skin coming off I
mean it was a process for like that last
week but I still would probably like you
know like if I didn't have the time to
go to the nail salon it's something to
do but I just don't like the in-between
process it kind of just like
grosses me out even tried like really
scrubbing my feet to get the dead skin
off and it wouldn't come off just all
naturally could fell so I wouldn't try
it again but it does work so there's
that and also for the laser um
I don't notice like a huge difference
probably cuz it's not as strong you know
it's the ones you can get at the
doctor's I definitely want to keep
trying it and keep you guys updated on
it but it wasn't too bad well I will see
you guys in my next one bye
you step clouds and the Queen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
