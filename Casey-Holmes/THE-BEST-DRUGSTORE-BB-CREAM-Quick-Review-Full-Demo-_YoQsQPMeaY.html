a BB cream review and I asked you guys
on Instagram if you wanted to see a
video and a lot of you said yes so I
decide to do that for you today and I'm
not going to make this super long and
dragged out because I feel like reviews
that are like that are just so boring
and bland and I don't like them so I'm
going to kind of make it short it's the
bullet points and show you of course a
demo at the end of the video everything
I use in a demo for this video is all
drugstore so you can get this at your
local drugstore or Ulta and just agree
easy to get your hands on and pretty
inexpensive so the bigger cream I am
talking about is this Garnier BB cream
for combo to oily skin and this stuff is
amazing I have the medium deep and the
light medium and the first one I bought
was the medium deep and it was just a
little too dark for my skin tone I have
to be pretty tan to wear this so I went
on about this one but then the light
medium can be a little too light so
mixing the two if it's the right
proportions um eight but if I just mix
the two together and then I get my
perfect shade and I honestly just am
obsessed with these now don't ask me if
I prefer it over the Smashbox BB cream
because I haven't able to try this much
because this color is way too dark and
looks kind of orange on my skin but this
makes what the light medium works really
nice as well so basically this is great
boilie skin on you have super super dry
skin I would kind of probably steer away
a little bit towards it or just apply
extra moisturizer on your skin because I
feel like this was really really really
clean to the dry patches you might have
and just look really caked up and not
too good but if you have oily skin this
is amazing it dries kind of quickly and
it just looks really awesome I feel like
it looks even better throughout the day
and I just love it a lot of you know I
have redness here basically in the
center my
I mean a lot more redness here on my
forehead but this covers my redness
amazingly it actually makes my pores
look a lot smaller than they are and
I've never experienced a BB cream like
this to be as full coverage as it is
like it's freakin phenomenal the only
con I do have to say about the CV cream
is this smell basically it smells like
really harsh chemicals but honestly you
only smell it when you're blending it
out and then after splendid out and kind
of set into your skin you don't smell it
I don't ever smell it throughout the day
I don't smell it now um I just I think
it's just when you first start putting
it on you'll smell it but don't be
scared away by it because it does go
away once you blend out the product and
also how I applied it I've applied with
my fingers my Beauty Blender a brush and
this is by far my favorite way and it is
C Sigma angled kabuki the f-84 it's my
preferred way of applying it that way
you don't your fingers on dirty and you
can just buff it out really quickly and
be done yes that's basically on to say
the only con is the fact that it does
smell but it keeps you matte and save my
face for a long time throughout the day
if I do have to touch up its of course
my t-zone which it's super easy you can
use like the Maybelline Dream matte
powder just a touch-up or just take a
tissue and blot your face that's why I
do most of time and usually I don't even
have to apply powder it's usually if
it's way later in the day I'll have to
apply some powder but most of time I
just blot and then I'm good to go
and take the light/medium and squirts
them on the brush I'm going to go ahead
and use the medium date today just a tad
I'm just going to put this all over my
skin the smell is pretty strong so
that's one thing I don't like about it
but it's a great product so I put it on
and I just buff it in I could probably
put a little more medium deep in there
but we could always use bronzer to
bronze up the skin a little bit
now if you feel like this stuff really
does dry fast so you want to kind of
work quickly with it you don't have to
be like super quick but you know just
keep it going and buff it in and make
sure you have it nice and lit it all
over your face and then what I'm going
to do I'm gonna let that sit and dry and
do its thing and I'm going to take my
concealer which is the Mac Pro Longwear
I'm just going to go ahead and apply
this underneath my eyes and this is
basically the routine I do whenever I
wear a BB cream
you
one thing I will do is add a little bit
of concealer on the bridge of my nose
because my nose does get pretty red
throughout the day and that's the first
place for anything well on my nose like
foundation or whatnot will fade so I
just put a little bit of concealer on
just using this Mac palette the pro
conceal incorrect palette and medium and
I love it because you can just mix your
shades and get your perfect shade for
this after we got it on and our
concealer on I like to take a powder
foundation you can use a regular powder
if you just like this coverage but I
figured just to add a little bit more
coverage of if I'm going somewhere or
whatnot I want to use this NYX stay
matte but not flat foundation our powder
foundation and it just looks like this
just regular powers will also help with
the color and help it match a little bit
better so this powder is really nice
it's not cakey and it makes your skin
look nice and flawless with the BB cream
let's see I'm going to use this NYX
bronzer in medium I'm just going to use
this Ecotools brush go in this bronzer
and just kind of bronze up my skin this
is such an amazing like bronzing brush
because it's so big and it just blends
out amazingly I love it
after I'm done bronzing up the skin I'm
going to use this Milani breath blush in
Luminoso I always say brush instead
blush I don't necessarily know why but I
do it all the time so I'm just going to
apply this to my cheeks just nice to add
some color and I love it you can just
kind of blend anything out with your big
brush and that's pretty much it so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and
