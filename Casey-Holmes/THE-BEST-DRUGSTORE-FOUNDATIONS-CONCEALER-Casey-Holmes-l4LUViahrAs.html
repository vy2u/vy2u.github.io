today I'm going to be sharing with you
guys my favorite drugstore foundations
and my favorite drugstore concealers
also have one primer that I want to
mention to you guys I don't find a lot
of primers from the drugstore that I
really like I usually just use high-end
ones to be honest with you they're just
my favorite and I've found a few that
are like my Holy Grail product but I do
have one that I figured I would share
with you guys if you are interested also
this is going to be a two-part video so
if you're interested in the second half
of this video it'll be up very very soon
it's with powders what else we got
powders contours bronzers blushes lip
gloss lipstick I just have so much stuff
that I need to share with you guys that
I figured I would divide it up and I
asked you guys on snapchat as well what
you wanted to see and a lot of you said
two separate videos also don't forget to
subscribe if you haven't already there
will be a link down below in the
description box you can also click the
little bell after you subscribe and that
will get you notified every time that I
upload a video so without further ado
let's just go ahead and get started
first product I wanna talk about is a
primer now I don't talk about primers
very often from the drugstore just
because I don't ever find one that I
really love I love this one and I also
love the soap &amp;amp; Glory one heck of a blot
primer I don't know if people consider
this drugstore but it's a really great
line it's at Ulta but I really do like
this elf one I bought it on a whim but I
will say it doesn't renew Trull eyes any
redness on my skin but what it does do
is create a nice smooth base for me I
feel like if you have combo normal or a
little bit of dry skin you would really
like this just because it's not
mattifying whatsoever it doesn't claim
to be it just claims to even out the
skin tone and to like dye down the
redness a little bit even though it
doesn't do that it's still really
soothing on the face and it just makes
everything glide on very smooth and soft
okay next up is also a foundation by elf
I really like this foundation now you
don't see it too much on my channel
because I have to be like super tan to
wear this like super self-tanner at
least and I don't really know what the
name is but I'm in the color sand when
I'm tan basically I think oh this is the
one for acne prone skin and it's really
good it has really nice full coverage
and it feels really great on the skin
when I say full coverage you guys I'm
talking like insane full coverage it
covers every
thing looks so good on the skin I
actually really like this color - when
I'm tan because it's not too pink and
it's not too yellow it doesn't
accentuate pores anything like that I
love this foundation I just need to go
get more colors moving on to my next
favorite oh you can see I love this
foundation this just looks so stinking
good on your skin this is oil-free but
it doesn't claim to be mattifying but
since it is oil-free it's a little bit
better for oily skin and it's kind of
hard to find a drugstore foundation to
be oil-free believe it or not
a lot of them aren't but this one is so
good first off the packaging is adorable
I think it looks nice and sleek this has
a medium to full coverage finish I don't
have a problem building this up I think
it looks stunning
it doesn't look cakey or anything like
that and it's not too luminous it has a
little bit of a shine to it this lasts
for so long on your skin and I remember
I was going through a phase where I was
not trying anything else I was only
using this for the longest time this is
like the first Maybelline foundation I
felt absolutely in love with like in a
really long time I have another one from
Maybelline that I love too but this one
kind of like got me back on that okay
drugstore makeup is getting better it's
doing good and then this one from
Maybelline is the dream matte mousse
this is an oldie but a goodie and I just
found out about this this past year and
I love it so I have that whipped texture
as you can see right there and this is a
full coverage foundation on me it is
amazing I love to apply with a Beauty
Blender I think it looks great I do like
to apply it with a brush as well but
Beauty Blender is more of the way that I
like to go and it just blends on the
skin so well your face feels so soft
after you applied it all your other
products blend on top of it beautifully
and it is a matte finish but it's not a
dry flat matte it's just a nice satin
natural-looking matte finish which I
enjoy because I put powders on top of my
foundation so it doesn't have to be like
suck my face dry matte this is a really
great foundation if you have not tried
it out I definitely recommend it if you
have oily skin because I think it's
awesome it's not like the ideal way I
would like to put on foundation but this
is great like if you don't want to put
it on the back of your hand or something
like that saved the best for last
because this is the one that I am most
obsessed with right now that I just
can't get enough
up and I don't know if a lot of people
consider Sonia Kashuk drugstore but to
me it is because it's in the drugstore
chefs section so the foundation that I'm
talking about is this wonderful beauty
right here I have it on my face right
now this is a Sonia Kashuk soft focus
satin matte foundation and oh my gosh I
saw this in store one time and I was
like asking on snapchat if I should try
it out or not it wasn't too sure I went
back the other week and I got it and
ever since I tried it you guys I have
been using it every single day I am so
in love with this foundation I also love
the Fionna styles matte foundation which
is a higher-end foundation but once I
got this I was like okay you need to
hold on for a second because this one's
coming in to take your place for a
little bit it is so lightweight this is
probably the most lightweight foundation
ever like you can't even feel it on your
skin it doesn't feel heavy at all it
covers absolutely everything I mean this
is just right now this is my baby it
does have that natural matte finish it's
not super drying on my skin at all will
say they don't have a really wide
variety of colors that's the only thing
that sucks about it and sometimes that
sucks about drugstore foundations in
general is they don't have a lot of
shades but if you can find your shade in
this foundation I highly recommend
picking it up so I didn't even realize
this while putting this video together
but all of my concealers that I'm gonna
mention to you which are three are from
Maybelline Maybelline has some really
good concealer so first one is like a
cult favorite here and it's the
Maybelline fit me concealer I really
like this a lot it reminds me of the Too
Faced Born This Way concealer because it
has that lightweight texture but it
still covers like about medium to full
coverage depending on how much you build
it up I love the packaging of it as well
you can see I use quite a bit of it
because the side of its just scraped off
but it's really lightweight it does
Brian underneath the eyes beautifully
and I just really love this drugstore
concealer the next one is a little bit
thicker this is the Maybelline master
conceal camouflaging concealer I really
like this as well it is a little bit
heavier but it covers a lot more it's
definitely more of a full coverage
concealer and you have to be kind of
careful with it because you don't want
to apply too much or I also look a
little bit cakey but this covers any
dark circle it brightens underneath
eyes and if you have this concealer in
like the shade of your skin it will
cover a blemish in a minute it is such a
good product to cover acne or anything
like that I really enjoy this concealer
and I also love it underneath my eye now
you know if I like this foundation I
probably like this concealer so of
course I had to mention it these two
together are a match made in heaven like
it's so good this is the maybelline
superstay better skin concealer also
reminds me of the Too Faced Born This
Way concealer I feel like between this
one and the Maybelline fit me you would
be set with concealers the formula is
kind of the same they kind of feel the
same they're very light weight and they
also have that same medium to full
coverage finish but I just really love
this one with this foundation there's
just something about it they mix so well
together I guess that's why they're in
the same wine I also do like this one
for blemishes as well I don't really
like the Maybelline fit me for blemishes
but I do like this one because I feel
like it covers everything kind of
seamlessly it's not a full coverage
concealer but if I apply a little bit
extra and I just dab it on it'll cover
any blemish that I have perfectly and it
doesn't look cakey or dried out you know
what I mean okay guys so that's it for
my drugstore favorites for foundation
concealer and a primer I hope you guys
