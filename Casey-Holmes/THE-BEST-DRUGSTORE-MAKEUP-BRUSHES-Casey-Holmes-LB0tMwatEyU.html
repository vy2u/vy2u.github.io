today's video is going to be part two of
my drugstore favorites I just got ready
I know this is really simple look I've
been doing that a lot lately but I got
ready on Facebook I did a Facebook live
so if you have not checked that out you
definitely should by the time this video
goes up it'll been about a week since I
did my first facebook live so check it
out down below on my Facebook fan page
and make sure you like it so that way
when I do more or facebook lives you're
notified and I had so much fun and yeah
I just can't wait to do more I wanted to
do a part two because I have a lot of
drugstore favorites that I want to share
with you guys and I'm talking there's a
lot there is a lot so I'm not going to
talk about each product too long I'm
just going you know some of my favorites
what I'm loving and just kind of go
through these products fairly quickly I
did do a drugstore foundations and
concealers IDEO which if you haven't
checked that out I will leave it down
below in the description box and also in
a card right here that you can click on
if you're on a desktop and before you
start this color on my lips is the
Sephora cream lip stain and number 41
okay so let's start off with powders
first I have a lot of powder that I
don't actually don't have one of the
powders that I would have mentioned to
you guys but the Maybelline butter skin
powder is amazing it's actually in my
purse right now because we went out of
town to Baltimore and that was that's
like my go-to powder that I touch up
with and everything but these other two
powders I love a lot as well so this
one's the essence all about matte fixing
compact powder and I like this because
it's more like a translucent powder it
does have a little bit of a white cast
to it I will say but if you use the
smallest amount it does look really nice
and it does mattify the skin so this is
awesome for oil control and it's great
in the summer town another one that I
love this one's not focused on being
matte it's just to kind of like set your
under eyes and everything like that this
is the NYX HD finishing powder in the
shade banana this is really great to set
your eyes with if you don't like to bake
or anything like that it's a really fine
powder and it looks so smooth underneath
the eyes and it blends so well if you're
looking for more of a banana shade this
is way to go it doesn't look banana on
camera when I'm looking at at the
viewfinder but it's just a light tint of
yellow and love this flower Beauty one
you guys know this is the shade lo1 it's
my favorite to bake with I feel like it
just makes me look flawless and I just I
love it with every foundation any
it's just my favorite it's my favorite I
do have the matte one but I can't tell
you if it's mine go to right now I need
to try it out a little bit more but this
one the shade lo1 I have gone through
one whole jar of it and this is my
second one and I just I can't get enough
of it so you can get this at Walmart if
you're interested and then another one
that's really good that is a loose
powder is this airspun loose face powder
I would recommend the non scented one
this one is scented and it's very very
strong so if you're sensitive to smells
you might want to go with the other one
but this is really great I think it's a
great alternative to high end powders
and it does leave your skin it nice and
smooth as well and sets that makeup and
locks it into place okay let's move on
the contours and bronzers because I have
so many so many that I just go back and
forth with a lot of you're going to know
most of these but the first one that I
talk about all the time is this
Neutrogena healthy skin's natural
radiance bronzer in xxx sunkissed this
is amazing you can just tell by the pan
how much I love this I know I'm about to
hit like pan right in here very soon it
just looks beautiful I'm wearing it
right now it's a natural tan finish it's
very smooth it blends like a dream and
for like the color of my skin whether
I'm a little bit more tan a little bit
more fair it just works and it blends
out and it looks awesome so my favorite
one has to be this one
hands down decks are more contour
powders not necessarily bronzing all
over my face this is the elf press
mineral bronzer this was in the shade
caramel cabana and this is pretty dark
but once you blend it out and if you use
a really light hand with it it does look
really really good has that nice kind of
warm and ashy tone to it so it's not too
warm not too ashy it's more of that in
between shade and I just really like it
a lot this is great to contour with
great to contour your nose with this is
it is well on the ashy side it's going
to create that natural looking shadow
another one I love this one also has a
highlighter in it I will say I'm not a
big fan of the highlighter in this but I
do love the bronzer it's the Catrice
cosmetics prime and fine professional
contouring palette palette palette so
this is what it looks like again this
one has more of that kind of ashy warm
undertone this one's definitely more on
the warm side but it does look really
nice on the skin you can see right there
it's a little bit more pink and I really
do like this it blends out very well
again another really smooth powder I do
like this Catrice brand I think
have a lot of great stuff and you can
also get them at Ulta so this is cute
and it's very compact so it's easy to
put in your makeup bag and go next for a
contour palette I love this from Ulta
now I will say there are a few shades in
here that will probably never use but I
really do like this palette this is the
Ulta contour kit and you have a lot of
shades in here you have two highlighters
one that's more pink one that is more
yellow toned and then you have four
different bronzers I personally use the
warm bronzer in the bombshell bronzer a
lot I mix them together out sometimes
contour this one and this one but these
are the two shades that I use the most
and then sometimes I'll use this to
carve out my contour as well really
really nice powders again very smooth
and buttery and they blend just
amazingly which is what I need in a
contour palette this palette is great I
think it'd be great for a freelance
makeup artist or if you're doing just
makeup on your friends for fun you could
use this for pretty much anything and
again for eyeshadows I mean that's what
you can use this for if you don't know
what to do with the other shades last
one I want to talk about is actually an
elf duo I loved these duo's from ELF I
think they're amazing this one is the
Fiji matte one and these are both matte
shades I love this matte blush and I
love this matte contour they're just so
pretty this blush is a perfect everyday
color and then the contour shade is not
as pigmented as the rest you can see
it's right there but it does cast and
eye shadow underneath the cheekbone if
you want to contour with it or if you
just want more of like a warm toned
blush this would be perfect for you
since it's not too dark and then this
blush is absolutely amazing it's so
pigmented and beautiful and just a great
color to go with pretty much everything
moving on to eyebrows I love this elf
brow pencil I'm normally not a brow
pencil kind of person but when I do use
brow pencils I do really like this it
has a spoolie on one end and then you
have the crayon on the other that's just
retractable that's what it looks like
it's a really great product I love the
packaging like the white packaging is so
cute to me and this does blend onto your
eyebrows really nicely it's smooth very
pigmented and creamy but it's not too
difficult to work with and I love the
fact that the stick is kind of thicker
it's not as thin as the Anastacio brow
is I appreciate that it's not as easy to
break and I feel like I have more
control with a thicker thing like this
so I really
okay I do like the Anasazi umbrellas as
well by thinking you want more of an
affordable option definitely check this
out it's awesome I think it's like one
two three dollars maybe three I can't
remember but it's good and this bully
does blend out very well
also another brow product that I can't
find right now is the Ulta brow pomade
it is so good it's a great dupe for
almost any high-end brow pomade it's
awesome I will say it is a little bit
more creamy and sometimes it doesn't
last as long but it's great for the
price and I highly recommend checking it
out moving on to a blush I do this is
like the blush that I always always
always go to and I will recommend to you
it's the ultimate blush in princess the
Ulta velvet blushes are awesome they're
very pigmented I'm wearing this one
right now and this one has a little bit
of shimmer in it but you can't tell on
your cheeks at all doesn't look like too
glittery or anything like that it's just
one of those perfect formulas that's
hard to find at the drugstore love us a
lot
this color is like my go-to for every
single look a dramatic look something
cool tone warm tone anything like that
this is the one that I like to go to
okay
my two favorite drugstore highlighters
this first one you're not going to be
surprised because I love this and I just
cannot get enough of it I found it
online at one point if I could find it
again I will link it down below but this
is a wet and wild boozy brunch
highlighter now when you first look at
this you're like I don't know that is
gonna be a good highlighter but it's
good you just mix it all together and
you get this nice golden shade if you
don't like golden highlighters you're
not gonna like this but if you like
golden highlights oh my gosh you're
gonna be obsessed with it so pigmented
it reflects light beautifully and you
would think with this pink in here you'd
be like oh I don't know is that gonna
show up on my cheeks it does not at all
on me is so good very creamy you get a
lot of product in here such a great
highlighter and I love golden
highlighters and this is like my baby
and then the one I'm actually wearing
today is a newfound love that I just
can't get enough of it is the essence
pure nude highlighter this is a super
creamy gorgeous like baked highlighter
and when you first swatch it you're kind
of like okay that's nice you know you
kind of just think it's more of like an
average highlighter and then you swatch
it and you kind of think the same thing
but once you put it on your
cheeks it just reflects the light so
beautifully and this is that perfect
champagne kind of glow it's not too gold
it's not too pink it's right there in
between and it blends out very easily
and it doesn't accentuate texture and
you can get this on Ulta essence has a
lot of great things and this highlighter
is definitely one of them
couple eyeshadows I want to talk to you
about are these Catrice liquid metal
eyeshadows these are very intense very
pigmented these could also double as
highlighters if you wanted them to if
you're into a really intense highlight
this is the Catrice liquid metal eye
shadow and Cetina van der woodsen and
also in we are champagne they're so
pigmented look at that I'm barely
touching that as well it's just so
beautiful looks good with any look you
could do so many things this you can use
as a face highlighter eyeshadow anything
it's just stunning and they blend out
really well these have to be the
creamiest drugstore eye shadows that I
have found that are like this metal kind
of look and I really like them I do like
this makeup revolution eyeshadow palette
in the iconic Pro one this is a great
nude for the first lorac Pro palette I
think I did a full video on this you
could definitely tell that there was a
difference between the two but this is
still a pretty good eye shadow palette I
do like if you just want to buy
drugstore eyeshadows
I think makeup revolution has some great
options for you and I think this palette
is my favorite one that I've tried from
them so far so again this is the
salvation palette iconic Pro number one
so I have one mascara to share with you
guys it's the Maybelline lash
sensational this is an amazing dupe for
the benefit roller lash if you do not
want to spend the money on that then you
can definitely check this out and you
will get the same effect all I think I
will say is that this does like a little
bit umm but if you can get past that
then this is a great dupe for that and
you can also get the waterproof kind as
well I have not tried waterproof so
maybe waterproof doesn't flake is bad
but this one does flake a little bit but
otherwise it's the exact same as the
benefit roller lash let's talk about a
couple tools before we get onto lip
products they also have a lot of lip
products so I have a few tools here to
tell you guys about now this is not
drugstore but it's Ulta and it's cheaper
than the Beauty Blender so I think this
is considered drugstore in my opinion
this is the japonesque Beautyblender and
i love this a lot it's so good it feels
just like the pro Beautyblender and if
you buy this it comes in a set with this
big old sponge a smaller sponge and you
also get a cleanser for eighteen dollars
that's a really good deal to get to
beauty blenders and a cleanser for
eighteen dollars whereas the beauty
blender I think is like eighteen dollars
by itself so definitely check this out I
have two brushes from ELF that I really
like if I don't use my Sephora brush for
my highlighter which is the Sephora
number 79 brush i will use this elf
small tapered brush this is great to
highlight as well and it kind of looks
very similar to the sephora one so you
can see right there this one's before
this one's elf but I just feel like this
for one pax on the color very nicely but
again if you don't want to spend that
kind of money on a brush totally
understandable this is a great
alternative for that and it really
highlights the cheekbones very nicely
and I think it's awesome you can also
use it to contour if you wanted to this
has to be one of my favorite blush
brushes it is so nice and it's from the
drugstore it's the elf flawless base
brush and you can use this for a lot of
different things as well but I feel like
to pack on blush it's just perfect
perfect for my cheeks and it just really
lays that product nicely and it blends
it out really well now if your blush is
very pigmented I would use a very very
light hand with this but it works just
as well as a high-end brush and I highly
recommend it next two are from the Mei
brand that you can actually buy at CVS
and this is the mua makeup academy
stippling brush I've been using this for
I don't even know how long I feel like
forever like maybe a year a little over
a year this is the best stippling brush
ever and it feels so high-end it has a
really long handle easy to blend
everything out the bristles are soft
they're not stiff they don't scratch you
you know sometimes you get drugstore
brushes and they're kind of scratchy
that is not this brush is absolutely
amazing and then another one I recommend
this is mu a professionals contour
highlight blush I actually like to use
this for multiple different things like
sometimes I'll use it for blush contour
sometimes I'll use this to highlight
just depends on what I'm feeling I'm
usually not into duo brushes like this
because I don't like to store them but I
really do like this one the bristles are
really really soft and everything blends
well with these brushes and then the
last thing that is not a makeup tool
before we get to lip products it
is the Palladio rice paper blotting
sheets if you have oily skin you are
going to love these threes why I love
these so much is because they're
different they have one side with a
powder and the other side is just a
plain old sheet that you can use so if I
don't have powder throughout the day I
will use the powder side so what it does
soaks up the oil but it also adds powder
to your skin as well so it kind of looks
like you put more powder on but you
didn't it's just so good and never makes
your skin look cakey or anything like
that but it does soak up the excess oil
and then powder is the skin again so
you're nice and match these are my
favorite blotting sheets by far so
awesome and very affordable as well
again with the Palladio brand I love
these lip liners they have some of the
best lip liners in the drugstore hands
down they are so creamy beautiful they
blend so well they're soft on the lips I
just they have the best colors too I
really really love this brand and their
lip liners they're awesome and they kill
it every single time I've never
purchased a lip product or something
from Palladio that I didn't like I don't
believe I don't think I've ever disliked
something from that brand really quickly
while we're talking about Palladio I'm
just going to shout out these lippies
right here these are the Velvet Matte
lip creams or wait they're The Velvet
Matte cream lip colors and I think these
are great they are just awesome they
stay on your lips for a while they don't
dry them out at all and the packaging is
adorable it looks like a lipstick and a
clear case it's just stunning my two
favorite colors are raw silk and blue
Luke Lee Buckley I'm not too sure I say
that that's what it looks like right
there so I'll show you raw silk god
they're so pigmented that one's raw silk
you can see it's like a nice Mavi color
nice tofo applicator it applies
everything really well and then this
one's the one that starts with a beet I
have no idea how you say this those are
stunning so stunning and then some more
things that I'm loving are the new
L'Oreal infallible lip paint these are
definitely more like a pigmented lip
gloss but they have really great colors
and I love the applicator the applicator
on the end is like nice it kind of just
cups your lips I don't know it's really
weird but these last for a really long
time as well and as you can see they are
super
wented so spicy blush is one I've
mentioned in a recent favourites video
because I love this color and then
another one that I love is nude star
they did send me the full line and I'm
so grateful for it I actually purchased
these before they sent them to me and
fell in love with them but that's what
they look like it's just they're just so
pretty too more lip products and we are
done I feel like I've been talking so
fast and a lot but I'm just trying to
get through this video pretty quickly
for you I've everything listed down
below in the description box if I talked
a little too fast in this video but this
is a L'Oreal infallible Pro matte gloss
I love these these are not like a liquid
lipstick but they're exactly what they
say they're a they're a matte lip gloss
if that makes any sense these are so
good again with the applicators I feel
like L'Oreal always killed it with the
applicators and it's so pigmented oh my
gosh so they're not claiming to be a
liquid lipstick so you can see it's not
like a high shine or anything like that
it is a matte gloss these do last quite
a while as well and then my very last
color all these colors look like exactly
the same so you kind of the color scheme
I like to go for this is the jcat soft
matte lip cooler this is awesome it does
take a little bit longer to dry on your
lips but once it does it's not going
anywhere and it's really nice and
affordable I think the packaging is
adorable and this color is in the shade
frozen cocoa this is in the shade frozen
cocoa again they have a nice little
applicator as well and then this is the
color of it you see how pigmented that
is stunning such a stunning color goes
with absolutely every look I just love
it oh my gosh that is so in this so
pretty ok guys so that is it for this
drugstore favorites video that is it for
all the drugstore favorites that I am
loving so far stay tuned I will be
trying out a lot more new products
because I know that the drugstore is
coming out with so many things right now
and I just need to get my little gritty
hands on them because I just can't I
can't wait I need to try everything out
