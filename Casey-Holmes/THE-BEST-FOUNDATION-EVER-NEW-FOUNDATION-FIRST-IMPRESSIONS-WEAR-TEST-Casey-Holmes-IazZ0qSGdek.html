to be reviewing in this new YSL all our
foundation I am so excited to test this
out I was reading the creams on the box
sounds real good so I'm very excited to
try it out for you guys and see how this
work we're going to do a wear test today
and just see how long it lasts I have
some things to do run some errands I got
a lot of run around to do so we're going
to go ahead and get started with this I
hope you don't mind I'm in my robe but I
won't be like this for long and you're
interested in seeing this review if
definitely keep watching and don't
forget to subscribe before you leave so
you don't miss out on any of my videos
and if you're interested in seeing how
this wears like I am then let's just go
ahead and get started so I got two
different shades I got to show you sand
and honey the way I'm kind of doing it
lately as I get like I shade that maybe
a little my camera Stein of course is of
course okay so like I was saying I have
been buying a foundation that I feel
like would be maybe even a little bit
too tan for me but good for like right
when I still tan and then a shade that
might be my lighter shade you and say
guys sand and honey these are point 8 4
fluid ounces which a standard foundation
usually has one ounce so I'm wondering
why less than well why yourself there
are 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 shades
almost four and a half stars says the
coverage is full this is great for
normal combination oily skin is a new 24
hour full coverage foundation that
instantly blurred pores and fine lines
and provide uninterrupted flawless wear
that looks and feels just applied all a
day does it won't cake dry flake or fade
transfer proof oil-free non pore
clogging that this foundation stands up
to makeup meltdowns by combining move
with you flexible pigments and skin
loving ingredients for a better flawless
coverage and skin that feels fresh and
comfortable from day to night the
blurring formula instantly concealed and
erases imperfections pores donuts and
unevenness skin looks flawless up to 24
hours that's a lot thanks to the highest
concentration of ultrafine oil absorbing
pigments that cover and smooth perfectly
yet resist fading heat humidity dryness
in touch formula is also infused with a
black tea antioxidant complex for
additional skin care that come back
signs of dullness and fatigue while
protecting the skin from pollution all
right how to use let's check this out so
it has suggestion uses for lighter
coverage higher coverage or buildable we
don't do the high one and squeeze
two drops onto a paddle brush gently
buff the foundation into skin for a
flawless complexion and matte finish I
am probably going to use it cosmetics a
flat top brush not a flat paddle brush
because I don't really like to use those
I'll just use them instead for a
buildable coverage you can use a sponge
wet and squeeze excess water from sponge
and use it mm Sarmatian across the skin
we'll try it both ways I do have my
L'Oreal sponge right here and then I
have the ëcause metics brush right here
as well very excited I love a good full
coverage foundation I have washed my
face moisturized and applied serum it is
that a little bit ago and so now I'm
going to apply my regular primers which
is the Smashbox primer water and cane
and often mattifying primer want to give
the foundation a fair shot I did this
with the milk makeup that I just showed
in my last video so I'm going to do it
for this one as well so this is the
packaging of the foundation when you
open it up it does tell you to shake the
bottle so we will be doing that today
and this one is in the shade honey it
looks pretty light in the bottle and
then we also have sand so we're just
going to sand honey just going to mix
the bottle is super super pretty
it is a frosted glass bottle with this
really pretty top you have a black
stripe going down the side you have some
info here on the back and then on the
bottom you do have the shape and then
there's the pump when you take it off so
color this isn't honey if it's a little
bit lighter than I expected maybe on the
skin will look a little bit darker but
there is honey there is sand I will be
so honest it does look a little bit
lighter than what I was expecting I'm
not going to go with sand I'm going to
go with honey so we're just going to see
what it looks like and then I'm going to
do this I would brush this I was a
sponge we'll go in with a brush first
and taking the lightest amount and just
buffing
I just smell like seems like something
okay so this is the first layer
definitely gives full coverage and it
looks really pretty on the skin blend
out really easily I'm just going to look
camera I need you to go together it
blend it out really easily it's a nice
here but it looks so like it looks like
skin it really did blur out poor oh not
make up so they blurred out pores this
is blur not pores this looks like skin
so this is how the foundation looks like
with just one layer I think it looks
really beautiful like it's looking
really good let's see if we can build it
up a little bit more even though we
really don't need to I just want to see
what it looks like because that layer
was great I mean it looks really nice
it's kind of a thinner foundation like
I'm kind of worried that my sponge will
soak up some of the product but that
looks really good go wine is them
alright so now we're going to try and
again this honey that I'm using is not
that dark I'm definitely have to get a
different shape when I am super self tan
so I'm taking a little bit more and I'm
going to use a sponge we're going to see
how this looks I will be honest I've
been a brush person lately well see if
we can see a difference with this I
don't know it looks pretty things and
lerton me a little bit more some crazy
like to see how much coverage I can
really go even if it is full coverage
and light give me more that looks so
freakin beautiful and it is effortless
to blend out yeah this might be my new
favorite I still have a lot left on the
back of my hand just kind of living the
two lines right here I feel like both
layers are gorgeous I think it's I mean
to me I know they say the sponge is
buildable even though I did do two
layers like I did on this side I feel
like it gives the same effect I don't
think it's really super light coverage
if you use a sponge I think it just it
looks the same to me I really
it because it really didn't cover
everything it feels very lightweight
definitely drying down I feel like it
took no time to blend it out on my face
and I just really like the way my skin
looks it looks like it has a healthy
glow to it it is more of a matte finish
but I would say it's more like a satin
matte I'm very interested to see how
this wears throughout the day but I'm
going to go ahead and apply the rest of
my face makeup and then I will be back
to give you guys another update okay
guys so I just finished doing my makeup
actually just did a little video on the
new a Mac roller liner I want to quickly
say I'm wearing the Sephora Pro warm
palette also I set my face with the
Estee Lauder perfecting loose powder I
really do like this I've been using it
since I did my last video really
enjoying it lip color is the elf liquid
matte lipstick and praline lashes are
meek Miami from lowly lashes and I think
that's pretty much it so this is what my
makeup looks like I'm really enjoying it
I think it looks really nice my
foundation looks so good in my opinion I
really didn't enjoy applying Lightman's
blush and I bronzer my highlighter and
just because it all worked so easy and
seamless and blended really well
don't matter brows and still trying that
feather pen okay I just really love the
way everything applied and I really feel
like my skin looks good my pores are not
accentuated it gave full coverage and
everything else on top just looks really
great and it just goes together just I
really like it so far - thumbs up for a
first impression and hopefully this last
twelve rough day hopefully my blush
bronzer all of that stays on really well
right now it is 1237 look a little scary
I'm gonna wear this throughout the day
and then I will come back give you guys
an update give you updates and natural
lighting as well and we'll see how this
baby layers took hold on you know I
didn't even see how much this one it is
$58 so it's very good
okay so figured I would give you guys a
natural light look at this foundation it
has not been long as 118 right now I
just ate a bagel my lip products coming
off of you to fix that this is what it
looks like in natural light I think it
looks really good like I'm impressed I
really really am like this looks so good
smooth it's not accentuating texture
honestly just really enjoying it
I know I don't have anything negative to
say I think it looks great yeah I think
I'm going to vlog today too so go check
out my blog channel you want to see some
new blogs hopefully the one forum today
will be up to it hi guys
so poking on Hanah lipstick my teeth let
me give you guys an update on this
foundation 641 and I feel like it is
going pretty strong
I'm not oily or anything in this area
it's also really nice and Mac I've been
outside taking photos and things like
that I ran some errands
earlier today Davis and I walk to the PX
a little hot sweating a little bit but
the foundation still looks really good
in my opinion I'm end up changing my lip
color to this Marc Jacobs lip cream and
slow burn because the elf logic I
completely wear it off yeah everything
is going really well absolutely looks
like we're about to head to the gym here
in just a little bit I don't know if I'm
going to wear this makeup to the gym
just have to see this is a little extra
for the gym in my opinion but we will
see when we go and all of that salt you
guys one more time after this is so far
it's going really well
feels very lightweight can't feel it on
my skin and splashed it so far
throughout the day so it is now 1101 as
you can see get all my eye makeup when
the makeup wipes before you went to the
gym we went to the gym around like 8 or
so and today was leg day so I just like
sweated my butt off and my leg day I
really really sweat so today it was like
a big test for the foundation normally I
don't wear makeup to the gyms because I
find it really pointless but I didn't
want to take off the foundation just yet
I wanted to wear it for a couple more
hours and just see how it wore at the
gym since I was sweating so much they do
have towels now just blot in my face so
you can see some of it kind of came off
on my nose also a little bit around my
forehead you can see like spots of
redness but honestly for the most part
the foundation does it look bad and
before I went to the gym the foundation
looked amazing like it looked so good
all day it's so lightweight and this is
like one of the contenders for my
wedding makeup because it just it looks
so beautiful and I really enjoy wearing
it
even order to negotiate I probably told
you guys that earlier I ordered another
shade to match myself tan but I'm
definitely gonna wear this tomorrow
I love it so much I like this one way
better than the milk makeup one that I
just tried in a previous video which is
like the blur liquid matte foundation
definitely think this one's better you
know that idea might tie in my face with
the towel all that I still think it
looks fine it doesn't look super cakey
or anything like that was above the
foundation by the way I almost didn't
give use up high like mascara running
down my face good it does not look half
bad and I haven't put more powder on
anything like that it just looks like
this that is my review on this
foundation I really hope you guys found
it helpful let me know if you try this
down below in the comments if you're
going to try it or not I feel like it's
been a long time since I found a high
end foundation now like completely in
love with and this one just like flipped
me off my feet I will see you guys in my
next video
