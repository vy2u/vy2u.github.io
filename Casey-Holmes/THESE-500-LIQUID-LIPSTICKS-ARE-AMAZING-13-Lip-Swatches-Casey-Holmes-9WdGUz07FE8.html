today I am bringing you a swatch video
of the new wet and wild cat suit liquid
lipstick I'm so excited about this
because all of these colors are so
beautiful they have so much pigment in
them I'm telling you these are the
liquid lipsticks to try if you're
wanting to try liquid lipsticks but you
don't want to splurge on high-end this
is the way to go because they feel like
high-end liquid lipsticks they are so
good so the range of these colors goes
from like a really nice nude like super
light nude all the way up to a really
deep color that is so vampy and
beautiful and when you see how these
swatches your going to be so surprised
because they are just stunning you would
never guess there were five dollars
honestly I've been drying these out ever
since I did my huge drugstore makeup
haul which if you haven't seen it I will
link it down below and also in a card
right here I was so excited to try these
out I still have to try my Jordana ones
but I will do that within the next week
and I'll do another swatch video in
review for you guy but there are 13
shades in this collection they are $4.99
a piece I found mine at Walgreens but
I'm sure you can find them wherever wet
mauled is sold they also have them
online as well I personally love these I
have ate drank kissed Davis and it lasts
all day long the only time it did not
last was when I was eating an ice-cream
cone and I was wiping my lips and it did
kind of wipe away so just be warned of
that but then again you know if you're
taking a napkin and wiping your mouth
probably not going to stay but I think
for $5 you cannot pass these up I think
they're a must-have item especially from
the drugstore these are by far the best
drugstore liquid lipsticks I have ever
tried Jordana is really going to have to
step it up to beat these or even come
close to them because they are awesome
all of these do dry matte but they don't
feel drying whatsoever I can wear this
for a long period of time and it's not
going to feel chapped it's not getting
into the creases of my lips highly
recommend checking them out I'm so happy
all of these were hits for me I love all
the colors too I feel like there's a
color for absolutely anyone yeah if you
want to see me swatch all these lip
colors and definitely keep watching
don't forget to like this video if you
did like it and subscribe to my channel
there's also a little belt right beside
the subscribe button that you can hit to
be notified every time that I upload a
video let me know in the comments which
color was your favorites and if you've
tried these yet and let me know your
thoughts as well also I will say the
last shade that I
which was not Goths topic it was video
vixen video vixen did need two layers
but it's so easy to put two layers on
and once it dries matte there are no
streaks at all so I really quickly
understand two guys everything else went
on beautifully I mean you'll see it in
the swatch video I hope you guys enjoyed
