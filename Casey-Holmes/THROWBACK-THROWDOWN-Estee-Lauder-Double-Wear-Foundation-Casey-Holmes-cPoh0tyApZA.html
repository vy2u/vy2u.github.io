a throwback throw down on the estee
lauder double wear foundation you guys
have been like hounding me about this
foundation wanting me to try it out and
I made it a point to not touch the
foundation until I did a throwback
throwdown
I am going to test this out for you guys
today it is a little bit late it's 3:24
but we all know I'm probably me up a
little bit later anyways because it's
Friday and honestly I have errands to
run so it's not like I'm going out
partying I'm just I got errands to run
bitch foundation used to be my Holy
Grail and everyone to college when I
call it my college years like when I
used to go out hard
this was my foundation that I always
wore and it lasted all night til the
next day because +0 I was not enjoy life
skincare and when I got home from a
night of hanging out with girlfriends
and drinking the last thing I did was
wash my face sometimes I wore this to
sleep just I don't recommend it but
sometimes I did you know sometimes
sometimes things happen but anyway so
this is last until the morning time and
I mean it would be like full coverage so
I'm very excited to try this out again
I'm not going to try it out overnight
like I used to but we will try for a
long period of time if you want to be
absorbed by throw down on this product
definitely stay tuned and give this
video a like if you're excited and don't
forget to subscribe before you leave so
you don't miss out any more throwback
throwdown
let's just go ahead and hop on into this
video they start at two shades I got the
shade that I used to wear all the time
which is 3wn tawny
I don't know how to spell look now I
think it's going to be a little bit too
dark for me but we will we'll check it
will see I got a lighter shade which is
a completely different undertones c1
into I just got this because it's
lighter and if I needed to lighten up
something I have it also if you don't
know you can buy Mac pumps Mac has
individual little pumps that you can
twist on two foundations those do fist
estee lauder double wear that's what I
used to use back in the day you do not
have pumps all you can do is pour it out
so if you go get that Mac one and twist
it on you will have a pump for the
foundation I'm going to look up a video
with me I'm going to search my names and
this foundation and we're bound to find
one video with this foundation so the
first one I see is a sailor Double Wear
foundation review and demo we're gonna
watch this together I have not seen this
video and I don't even know how long
bringing you a
quick review and like that all
foundation sizes money lately Marie's
world and where with a brush and it's
three W one another month a whenever I
felt and it is because it is a little
night for me okay so in this video I was
three W one when I was a little bit
lighter
that's nice I just love the shade when I
run nice weight when he says please all
I have about the foundation is that
there's not a pump but the foundation is
so good that I don't even care about the
palm is so full coverage you guys to me
reminds me of the Kat Von D foundation
it just doesn't look at cakey looks so
beautiful on the skin it doesn't at your
cordless big at all and I I'm just
obsessed with that nothing so that is a
something for this foundation it went so
well and don't estimate mm here's mine
it would be and a tea from the mornings
SAT so I do remember I used to use a
brush but I also use a sponge as well
because I wore this foundation for so
long because you guys know I love
sponges right now so that's where we're
going to apply it companies the regular
primers that I know I love and I know
that works well with a bunch of
different foundation so that's what I'm
going to use today so in that one video
I say three W one was a little light for
me so we're just going to roll with that
one and again this is in three W one
tani and I used to use I think it was
for W one as well maybe back packaging
and nothing has changed on it has the
same smell than I remember oh yeah this
is a call it this is a good match so if
I get any darker I just have to go with
a darker foundation okay not bad not bad
great coverage as always have a breakout
right here and it just like covered it
like a champ
alright now I'm going to use a brush I
don't have the SAT anymore unfortunately
I don't really use foundation brushes I
probably gave that away I am going to
try out this it cosmetics CC skin
perfecting brush that's dirty but I
don't have any other brush that accused
so we're just going to see
okay okay I need to believe in myself
whenever I use something with a brush
I'm going to use it with rush oh yeah
okay oh my gosh I'm so glad I decided to
try out the brush I kind of like the
brush side better believe it or not Wow
I'm like being really dramatic about
this you guys but I'm actually really
blown away all right then so that's off
to really good start now we're going to
do is put on some concealer I'm going to
send this dress to my face makeup and
I'm going to come back and give you guys
another update and we're going to go
throughout the day and see how it wears
see if it's still really good and I'll
be back to give you guys a full face
update okay guys so I'm back with my
school face done I'm loving the
foundation the foundation looks so good
on my skin right now and as you guys can
see I used this NARS soft matte complete
coverage concealer in medium one custard
I really really like this concealer
right now because it looks so good on
the skin normally pop concealers do not
look good on my skin with my texture my
pores but holy bananas and then I used
this Kat Von D lock-it brightening
powder in petal to set where I put
concealer this powder is freaking
phenomenal so you should definitely
check it out so from a highlighter I did
use my collab palette but the shade I
use this gold also for lips I did use
the makeup geek plush Mac's in a beach
bunny how appropriate is that since I'm
going for like a bronze pan look right a
little too matte for me so I did a clear
gloss on top and I liked it a lot so
right now it is 4:31 a little late I had
a foundation all for about an hour so
I've just been doing the rest of my
makeup chilling assisting in the music
you know it takes you a lot longer when
you're just sitting here listening to
use I'm really liking it so far again
here's a close-up of my skin the pores
look amazing texture looks amazing
everything on my face right now I'm
really happy with anyways I'm going to
go out run some errands that need to get
done where it gets too late and I will
see you guys in just a few hours hey
guys so doing another update at the
crochet store
I'm always here I figured I'll give you
guys a little bit of an update we're
running out of sunlight so throughout
6:20 right now everything you think it's
looking good
Foundation was awesome awesome the
foundation is like literally better than
I remember right now honestly because
even when I was looking at my skin and
like taking pictures with this
foundation I was like wow my skin does
look really good with this and I missed
it like I missed my skin looking like
this it's a full coverage foundation it
feels good we'll see you guys in just a
few more hours what do you guys think -
let me know in the comments by the way
I'm wearing my gold highlights pop in
right now hey guys welcome back so I'm
back for my last final update I really
need to go to bed so I'm like so tired I
don't stay up very late anymore I know I
just can't hang like that can I give you
guys an update right now it is 11:45
p.m. I have to say I still really like
the foundation I have not touched my
face with powder or blotting sheet
anything it's still going strong the
contour the highlight everything is
still going great on my face now even
though I haven't touched my face with
the blotting sheet I do think it's time
to blot my face and also it's kind of
taking a little bit around my nose I
don't know what's going on my nose
lately but a lot of foundations are
going into that crease which I don't
like I'm going to go ahead and take my
Palladio rice paper blotting sheets I
love these um at the drugstore or in
game at Sally's I hope things are out -
anymore so I'm going to just do half my
face so i blotting it it looks a lot
better to me already like I like it so
much better but that's how much oil I
got off of one side of my face
oh yes because you do now I won't say
between this one and matte foundation I
still think Estee Lauder is better I do
find that this one looks a little bit
more on the natural side for a full
coverage foundation like it doesn't look
like oh my god full coverage foundation
you know I mean sometimes the Kat Von D
can get like that you just have to be
careful with it but it is a really good
foundation I mean it stays in place all
freakin day let's go to this one and I
just think this one looks so beautiful
on my skin and I really enjoy it I mean
there's a reason why I kept using it
back in the dates because it's amazing
but I really like it I give it a two
thumbs up you guys and this day oh my
gosh you guys are releasing it a lot
more I don't know what it is but
something about this foundation I just
love it so much more and I get a lot
more excited about it I hope you guys
enjoyed this be on the lookout for this
makeup tutorial coming to you very very
soon I really love it and I hope you
guys love it too and thank you so much

thumbs up and subscribe before you leave
