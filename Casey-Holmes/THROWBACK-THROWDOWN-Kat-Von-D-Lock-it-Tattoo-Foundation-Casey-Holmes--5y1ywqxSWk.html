today is the first video I have for my
new series that is called throwback
Throwdown where I try out both products
and let you guys know what I think like
do I still love it do I think it's still
amazing yes my pistol bruise from a lot
of videos this weekend so I asked you
guys what you wanted me to do a survive
throw down on so I have sent me so many
things and I cannot wait to get back
into it the first one was supposed to be
the s ALR double war but I went to the
floor yesterday and got a lot of stuff
and if there and I was just go ahead and
do one on this cap on D lock-it tattoo
foundation and I actually have the video
right here it has quite a bit of use it
has 920 it has a nine hundred and twenty
thousand views so yeah we're just going
to list you what I said about it first
and then we're going to go into it so
it's a foundation one but I hate
watching old videos like mocking mocking
Nuneaton and puffiness so I figured I
was go ahead and get this up for you
guys oh wait you went to like my own
weight oh yeah yeah you put you a drone
girl way to mental night man
wait okay how many times are you does it
up and bringing it up so that you look
the exact same super silent thing I do
look like the foundation a lot it holds
up as well did I get it walking
throughout the day which has
so to read through all the claims to
have full coverage part is grateful
color 24-hour where I would be the
president of 24-hour where support for a
while and as longevity of it is amazing
bottom line I really liked it and I said
that it stayed meant for three hours so
we're going to see how it wears today
this cloud might be able to dark loamy
because honestly I wasn't planning on
using this right away I was going to
sell tan and everything before I tried
this out but we're just going to
hopefully make it work it's the shade
medium 54 the way I used to apply it is
with a Beauty Blender so that's what
we're going to do it today but not be
bad I mean might be a little dark we'll
see alright so I just let my L'Oreal
sponge it's my favorite and I'm going to
go ahead and put this on the back of my
hand and we're just we're just going to
wing it
actually might be a good color for me
right now Ganis in the shade at medium
54 it's literally the exact same has not
changed over the years I don't know if
you've changed the formula over the
years oh my gosh I almost forgot to pry
and put on I'm going to take my sponge
and then take a light amount and put
this on look at that looking good colors
not bad actually a little light
surprising
it is supercool coverage they're not
lying when they say this is very full
coverage I take better care of my skin
and then I used to so we're going to see
if it'll still keep me matte for a long
period of time a little bit longer than
three hours I might use this foundation
you guys and so long so I'm actually
really excited to see how it wears sell
today same with the Estee Lauder doubler
if you even watched me for a very long
time you know that was like my fangs for
the longest time I could not get away
from it I cannot wait to try that one
out for you guys again cuz it's been so
long you know we just get distracted by
new things on the market and just kind
of forget where your true love was so
now we're going to do is I'm going to
finish the rest of my face makeup I'm
gonna put my concealers on is not my
regular concealers which is the Tarte
shaped tape and then the Smashbox
24-hour concealer and then I'm going to
come back after I have my full face done
show you guys the time we're going to do
some updates throughout the day and then
I'm going to give you my final review at
the end but so far I'm really liking it
I think it does look really good right
now and I'm pretty excited about a tune
I'll be back in just a moment when I
have my full face done and we will start
checking in throughout the day okay guys
so I have the rest of my face makeup on
I'm doing very glam sinful coverage I
really like it so far I am mat girl I am
Matt I think I have like a breakout
coming through right here at Anu but
honestly I think it looks really good I
don't have any highlighter on right now
because I'm about to film a collab video
and I want to demonstrate the
highlighter in that video yeah
everything went on really well very very
full coverage so we'll see how it lasts
throughout the day is currently 1246
right now so like I said I will give you
guys an update later on and I'll have
highlight around by then so my sole glam
will be complete when I have a
highlighter on so I will see you guys in
just a few hours hey guys so for once
I'm doing an update with a grocery store
looking I think okay I mean obviously
just using texture I'm heading right now
nothing looks terrible I do think it
looks a little like soul on my skin I've
been filming all day today it's about 6
o'clock now or 602 exactly don't know
how long nuts been since
this on but I'm thinking for a while now
that wore my sunglasses a little bit
before this and I don't have any Sun
back which is really nice so that's how
you know it's full coverage and it's
just like stuck on my face and I will
see you guys in just a few hours okay
guys so it's officially past my bedtime
but officially the end of the night is
1147 as you can see I'm exhausted I'm so
ready take this makeup off after I do a
little powder session earlier when I
updated you guys I did bought once but I
haven't reapplied powder it is a very
full coverage foundation but it's not
heavy and like gross feeling on the skin
in my opinion I think it feels fine when
I will say though it's like used to I
would wear this kind of foundation like
day to day and you know I don't know
that's just that was just like
preference I would love a completely
full coverage foundation all the time
something that you know is just really
intense but now I would either wear no
foundation or I would wear my Sonia
Kashuk one because my Sonia Kashuk one
has a little bit more life to it this
one is definitely more of a super matte
like stay in place kind of foundation
and when your oils come through you
definitely do need a blob because it
looks a little off it is it look like
you're glowing or anything it just looks
straight up oily so liking the Kat Von D
lock-it tattoo foundation I'm happy this
was a positive review because I just did
that 120 dollars foundation review I
think it was yesterday and it was awful
it was just awful so thank you guys so
much for watching if you liked this
series don't forget to give it a thumbs
up and if you remember me loving a
products back in the day raving about it
definitely let me know down below if you
want me to try something new out was on
your mind because I need to go back and
look at my videos but you guys are quick
you guys remember so well so if there's
anything in particular you want to see
let me know in the comments and I thank
you guys so much for watching it don't
