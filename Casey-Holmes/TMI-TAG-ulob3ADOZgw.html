the TMI tag I've been asked to do so
many times and I did a poll on my
Facebook page if you guys wanted a Q&amp;amp;A
video or if you want the TMI tag and the
TMI tank definitely won so that's
probably doing for you guys today and I
was tagged by Meg which is Ciao Bella
and thinking thank for tagging me um but
yeah I'm just gonna go ahead get started
there's fifty questions so yeah
I actually just got back in from running
some errands so I'm just wearing the
outfit that I wore out today
this jacket is from necessary clothing
this little loose top is from H&amp;amp;M and
then I just had my favorite jeans from
forever 21 on they're just the
distressed ones that I show you guys
pretty much all the time
yes I have
not terrible but they never go smoothly
I am a 5-4
I weigh between like 125 to 130 it just
kind of varies if I go and eat Mo's I'm
going to be up there in the 130 if I
keep eating salmon it ain't good I'll be
down to like 145
I do not have any tattoos I go through
moments where I want to tattoo and I
know where I want the placement but I
just don't go through with it because I
just I don't know I just I don't know I
kind of get nervous I don't want to get
something and then regret it so I don't
think I'll ever have any tattoos
I do have piercings I have to hear I
used to have my cartilage Pierce forever
ago but I just have to I've had my belly
button pierced probably like five times
but it just never worked out so yeah for
right now
I don't know if this means I see
everybody say that they don't know what
it means so I go along the rails because
I literally have no idea what that means
my favorite show is Gossip Girl I love
Gossip Girl I'm watching it for the
third time now I just cannot stop
watching it it's my favorite along with
that 70s show I love a semi show and
Real Housewives of New Jersey Orange
County and Beverly Hills
you
I miss the warm weather is that sad I am
so over this cold weather right now I
just I miss being out in the Sun getting
some vitamin D taking the dogs out I
just I miss the warm mother
my favorite song at the moment let me
tell you what I recently downloaded and
those are my favorite songs currently so
the first one is definitely Beyonce's
drunken love is by far when my faves
show me by kidding
with Chris Brown another fave Luke
Bryan's she got me high J Cohen's
beachin what's that other song it's
t-paint of t-pain's up-down song love
that I have a lot of different favorite
songs it just changes because half the
time when I have a favorite song I
listen to it so much that I get sick of
it
I'm 22
my zodiac sign is a Sagittarius
someone who is nice not a jerk because
douchebags aren't fun to deal with um I
also look for someone who's honest and
someone who can just hold their own like
I don't want somebody that I had to like
baby them that just gets on my nerves I
can't stand guys who act like babies
my favorite quote is kind of religious
it says belief is the truth held in the
mind
faith is the fire in the heart and I
just really have always loved that
little saying
I know I don't really have one is that
sad I don't have somebody that you can
just get golf right off the top of my
head like I like a bunch of different
actors like when I see them in movies
and like oh yeah they do really good but
if you like put me in the airport with
them I would have no idea who they were
like I'm not good with actresses or
actors unless they're like super super
famous
I really have a favorite color I think
if I had to pick one I don't have a
favorite color I like a lot of different
colors
definitely loud music soft music makes
you want to fall asleep
I love loud music and it's what gets me
up and going and I just love loud music
I like to drive if I'm sad I like to
drive I usually end up at the mall or
somewhere I just I like to drive them
wherever it takes me
that's where I am so that's what I do
when I'm sad
this depends I can take like a
five-minute shower then I could take
like a 15-minute shower just depending
on what I'm doing if I have to wash my
hair but don't wash my hair you know
that kind of thing
this is another thing that just really
depends I mean you could take me
anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour and
a half
I have not
people who
and are grateful of things that they
have because I cannot stand people who
have a good life that just looked down
on it and they think that everything
they have is not good enough because
they have something better I like people
who appreciate what they have that's
just that's a really big thing for me
and people who also like embrace who
they are and don't try to be anybody
else I love that
I can't stand people who are full of
themselves like that's probably the most
annoying thing in the entire world
because like some people they think from
watching my YouTube videos like if you
do a hole or something they think you're
full of yourself but that's not the case
at all I'm far from being full of myself
I'm join YouTube because I watch the
videos for a couple years and I was like
I adore this and I want to do it so I
decided to do it and I I mean it's grown
into an amazing opportunity and I'm so
so grateful
I have little fears like bugs and snakes
and things like that I used to be afraid
of dying but I'm much better with my
faith now so I'm not really afraid of
dying anymore I think it's just how I'm
going to die that's scary but I mean huh
you can't worry about it I don't like
worry about it every day or anything
because when it happens it happens
I think there was like a video on
Facebook that was really sweet
and any cry I think it was probably
something about a dog or something like
a dog that got rescued I can't remember
but I don't I don't cry that much I'm
not really a crier
today
oh my gosh this one is something I had
to explain because people are like why
did you name your channel that this was
a name that I picked like back in 2011
and I had no intentions of putting any
videos up if I did I would have picked a
better name but uh it's blondie was just
one of those names that I liked I
thought it was cute and then was
different so yeah
I don't really read books and that's
kind of sad I know but I tried listening
to one book on audible by Tina Fey I
forget what it's called but it was
really good when I was listening to it I
just never finished it which is usually
my problem when I start books I never
finished them so whatever one that
whatever that one from Tina Fey is
that's the one I read
and I'm not currently reading one
Gossip Girl because I watch Gossip Girl
every day every time that TV is on I'm
watching the supernal
Colton
go to the last text it's a business
partner
favorite food would have to be oh my god
I love Mo's you guys Mo's is my weakness
I could have Moe's every day of the week
if it was possible to not getting a ton
of weight I love most I love Chipotle -
what am I in California or something I
think
Chipotle is where it's at Twilight is
better than modes but you know I'm
working with what I got it so I love me
some most burritos anything like that I
think that that's just the best food
I want to visit just anywhere tropical
like Cancun or something like I want to
be able to see like through the water
you know what I mean like I just want
some more that's super tropical honestly
not a lot of people I think it'd be fun
just to be kind of you know relaxing and
just enjoying everything
I was last at Publix doing some grocery
shopping
I don't know if you call it a crush
today
I mean it's just like how everybody else
is angel this question and all the other
videos if you put yourself out there on
YouTube Twitter Instagram when are you
not going to get insulted you're getting
insulted probably now but honestly I
mean that's the kind of stuff you just
don't like it to you
I love chocolate right now my current
weakness since it is around Easter time
are the whoppers like the Robin eggs
Robin eggs are like my weakness right
now holiday candy is always amazing I
just I can't get enough but chocolate
would definitely have to be the main one
I don't play any instrument I think I've
tried playing guitar at one point but it
just didn't work out
I don't really have a favorite piece I
don't have anything that's like super
expensive that I just have to have I'm
not too much of a jewelry person I like
MIDI rings I think those are my favorite
I used to do cheerleading and I did this
for a while actually ever since I was
little about to when I was almost when I
just started high school and then I quit
I used to love it I know some people say
it's not but it definitely is a sport I
want to see you put a girl up in the air
by yourself go ahead and do one man and
just go ahead and do some back
handsprings into a tuck and tell me it's
not a sport
it was probably the paranoid song
I don't know what a chat-up line is and
if it's a pickup line I honestly don't
have a favorite one because I think
they're all corny
obviously not
today
I know it some people have done this
video so I don't really know of anyone
else to tag but if you haven't done it I
would love to see it you can leave your
link to your video in the comments below
if you have done it so I can go ahead
and watch it
and yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
video thank you so much for watching and
I will see you guys in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
