sharing with you the two-faced Holiday
Collection which is awesome asked you
guys on Instagram if you wanted to see
this and a lot of you said yes and I'm
also gonna be doing a tutorial on this
look that I posted on Instagram I did
that look with one of these holiday sets
so I figured I would share that with you
guys because a lot of you really liked
the look and I really liked it too it
was fun and easy to do so I will
definitely be doing that for you guys
I'm sorry I'm a little out of breath
because I just ran up the stairs and one
more side note if I'm yelling at you I'm
so sorry I cannot here right now very
well my ears are clogged up from being
sick ever since I landed a Sunday night
and they have been clogged up and I have
tried ear drops and I think I'm gonna go
get some air candles tonight and try to
really like get all this out because I
can't hear like how loud I am I think
I'm really loud because I turn my music
up really loud to hear it I'm just like
I'm probably yelling at everybody right
now but I'm so sorry I just can't hear
my tone right now I filmed this
yesterday in front of my shoes and I
thought I was gonna like the different
scenery no I like nature I like that the
trees you can see in the background
luckily we have OK lighting right now so
uh hurry up and do this but I'm gonna
have detailed swatches at the end of
this video on my arm so you're gonna see
all the swatches for everything but for
the beginning I'm just gonna go through
each product show you them and let you
know and my thoughts ok so the first
thing is just a little mini gift and
this is the better than sex mascara and
it's just in a little ornament style
thing and you could just pop this on to
your tree cuz you have a little thing
right here and it has a to and from on
the back but I love the better than sex
mascara from Too Faced I usually use
this one or the benefit roller lash I go
between the two because I really like
both of them but I do really like this
one as well as though I'm not too
positive how much this was I couldn't
find it on the sephora site but it's
probably around like $10 or so ok so the
next set looks like this it's in a
really pretty turquoise secret secret
sequin coin case and it has a little
charm right here with the Eiffel Tower
on it
but this is called the two facelift
petite treasure set
$29 $72 value so in this set you get
three full-sized lipsticks which is
awesome the first one is one of my
favorite shades ever this is nude beach
from Too Faced and I just love this
color it is exactly what it says it's
just a nice nude it's a little bit
peachy a little pink and it's a really
really gorgeous shade a great everyday
color so you get nude beach by the way
these two-faced lipsticks are nice and
creamy and they feel really good on your
lips and then the other new dish one
this one's more pink but this isn't a
fee so it is just a more pink coral
color I love that color these are so
pretty
and the great thing about these three
and one kind of things is you could give
to one of these to your friends or put
them in stockings you know whatever you
want to do so you basically have three
gifts in one this was definitely an
interesting one this one is in the color
wham and it's a buried with a lot of
sparkles and shimmer in it but it has a
really cool look to it it's just it's
not something I would personally wear
but it has like purple glitter reflex in
there it's different but if you know
someone who doesn't mind shimmer or
glitter in their lipsticks they would
love this color because it is really
pretty so those are the three lipsticks
that come in this little set and I love
this little coin purse and props gonna
keep it in my bag because the sequins
don't come off okay so the next set is
one of my favorite sets because I
absolutely love these lipsticks from Too
Faced and it is the melted French kisses
the ultimate liquefied lipstick set you
get four liquid lipsticks in this as you
can see you're gonna bury a pink more
mommy nude and then another lighter pink
so again you could use this as one gift
or you could divide it up between your
friends or stockings as four separate
gifts this retails for $25 and it's a
$66 value now one thing I like about
this is I have a lot of these to face
melted lipsticks I have actually all of
them
I drop them actually have all of the
melted lipsticks and I like these sizes
better because I will never get through
a full-size of the melted liquid
lipsticks just because there's so much
product in them and a little bit goes a
long way and I actually have this one on
my lips right now this one is in the
color melted Chihuahua which is just a
gorgeous
Mabi nude I think I just spit on myself
so I'm sorry if you saw that that's
melted Chihuahua it's so pretty
I love this color these are very creamy
very pigmented and this is great to keep
in your purse on the go and your clutch
whatever then the other cream one is in
melted berry the gorgeous berry shade
it's coming off a little more red on
camera but it's definitely a true very
color very pigmented and this one is a
cream now these two are metal melted
lipsticks that's hard to say metal
melted lipsticks which means that
they're gonna have a more sheen to them
a little more glitter so this one is in
melted peony and it's just a light pink
but it has some shimmer in there and
it's not too overpowering like if you
don't really like shimmer I don't think
you'll be turned away from this but
there is some in it just to give it a
really pretty shame and then this one's
like a hot pink this one's in melted
macaroon and this was just a shiny hot
hot hot pink so that's what looks like
it's coming off more curl on camera but
it is definitely a hot pink color so
these are the multi lipsticks that come
in the set I love these I think they're
beautiful I think this is a great set to
get okay so the next set is so exciting
you know what this reminds me of it
reminds me of them Valentine's Day comes
around I have my favorite candy in but
on Valentine's Day they're like the
sweethearts candies like not the sweet
tarts parts but the sweet hearts like
the old school style with like this kind
of front and you could see them in there
and they taste a lot of people say it
tastes like chocolate I think it tastes
delicious that's what is a resume oh
haha
this one is the Too Faced melted kisses
and sweet cheeks
these are $36 and what's cool about this
is they come in this big pack but when
you open it up
they're three separate boxes so again
you can have three different gifts in
here that come with two products so I
think these are so cute and I love this
one so this is what it looked like and
you have a nude a pink and a purple
which is awesome and then again on the
back it does have a to and from on it so
I'm sorry my voice is like going out I'm
sorry this one has the deluxe melted
lipstick in nude and the deluxe love
flush blush and a love hangover I do
like this combo I love this little
lipstick and melted nude it is beautiful
I'm just gonna swatch this one this is
absolutely oh it is so pretty this is
what I had on in my pic that I showed
you guys earlier in the video oh my gosh
I love this lip color so much and then
it comes with the blush in love hangover
and these are the love flash blushes
which I do have these and they are
amazing but look at how little this is
it's so tiny but it's really cute it's
great for traveling so it just looks
like this it kind of looks like a Polly
Pocket blush or something like if Polly
Pocket had a blush this would be her
plush that is that set right there
really pretty more of a pinky blush and
when I first got this I thought this is
going to be more of a nude blush but
it's definitely more pink and then you
have them warm nude melted lipstick I do
like these blushes they do last a really
long time like I said I do have a few of
them and I think they're really great
and then you get this one which is more
of the pink set you get the melted
lipstick and peony and the deluxe love
flush blush and justify my love it's
just really pretty a little good on so
many different skin tones I really like
that color a lot and then you also have
blush as well again and justify my love
and they did put the names on the back
of them which i think is really great
this one's like a true cool tone baby
pink blush so that is that set right
there then the last one is probably my
favorite I love this set that's like
purple tone set this has the deluxe
melted lipstick and fig
another favorite and then the blush is
your love is King and Eva also asked for
the stuff just for yourself you know
like when I go shopping for people for
Christmas I'm like I'll get one for them
and then one for me because like stuff
like this makeup wise just sucks me in
man it's so cute
so this one is melted fig a gorgeous mom
I mean it is just so beautiful such a
wearable purple shape anyone could get
away with wearing this it's beautiful
and then again with the blush it's your
love is keen ah it's just a gorgeous
pinky purple color look it that's what
you know you work out too much sorry
about it so this one's a gorgeous pinky
purple blush oh my gosh I love this set
it's so cute I love it I love it I love
the whole set all of these colors are
beautiful moving on to another set this
is the Too Faced legrand the chateaux
set what's so cool about this box
I feel like this box you can't really
use like ice display year-round but this
one is like a super Paris themed box and
if you're a collector of things like
this oh my gosh you would love it so the
top just comes off like this and then
you open it up and you have three
different eyeshadow palettes in here and
you also have that better than sex
mascara so like I said I'll have
detailed swatches of all these shades at
the end of the video but right now I'm
just gonna show you and tell you a
little bit about them so the first one
is this pink one right here again they
have to and from on the back just in
case you wanted to separate any of these
as different gifts and they usually come
with a little sheet in here but I tried
to film this already so they're all kind
of messed up but this pink one has one
matte shades in five shimmer shades and
then it has this bigger blush or bronzer
whatever you want to use it for but this
is what it looks like these are more
pink more romantic colors and like I
said these are all shimmer and then the
cream is mapped and then this is a
shimmery blush as well the next one is
the black with the pink bow and this one
is more vampy really gorgeous it has two
matte no I'm sorry
this one has three matte shades three
shimmer shades and then
to blush so you have a matte cream mac
transition shade right here a matte
black this purplish shimmery and these
are shimmery as well and then this pink
blush is matte I think this is a great
palette because you can do so many looks
with it because you have a matte
highlight shade you have a matte crease
shade you also have a matte black in
here but you still have the shimmer
shades to really you know add something
else to the look if you could do it on
your lower lash line all over your lid
you know it's not going to be overly
shimmery so I think this one's a really
awesome palette this one's my favorite
because if your neutrals person you're
gonna love this one and them look at
those colors though this is a great
every day palette for someone who is
just starting out with makeup and just
doesn't know where to start
give them this palette because they have
everything they will need so these top
three are matte you have a matte cream a
matte to mid-tone shade and a matte
brown then you have these three shimmer
shades you have a more black with some
gold sparkle a brown and then kind of a
bronze and then this blush is called
Mademoiselle and it is beautiful it's
just a peach color it is so stunning I'm
obsessed with this blush looks comes to
this palette it is gorgeous but one
thing I will say about all these
palettes I'm about to show you is the
matte shades are beautiful they blend
really well very pigmented I personally
love them the shimmer shades are kind of
difficult because they have a lot of
glitter in them and a lot of fall out so
just be careful with that I applied a
shimmer shadow all over my lid and it
was all over my cheek like crazy you
want to use a smaller more dense brush
to apply them and one other thing I wish
they would have included is a like the
Too Faced glitter glue because that
really holds the glitter on the eye and
it doesn't like fall out everywhere
especially throughout the day I wish
they would have included that in some of
these sets but just fair warning if you
want to get these or try them out that
glitter will fall out really easily so I
would like to do your foundation after
your eyes or just use shadow shields or
something to have something that catches
all of that glitter because I had like a
lot of glitter on my cheeks that's the
only thing I did not like but everything
else I love about all of these palettes
I think they're great okay
so the second-to-last set is this pretty
blue one right here oh I didn't even
tell you how much Loretta though was the
Legrand chateau which is the little
house that just showed you guys it's $49
and it has a $250 I'm sorry and it has a
215 it all about you this set I'm about
to show you I couldn't find yesterday
and I can't find it again but I'll try
to look once I have my computer in front
of me and I'll like leave it in here
somewhere if I can find it but this one
is the second to left whose those Berger
oh my god it's a lash oh my god that
scared me so bad I hate when lashes make
me think they're spiders hey so this one
you just take off the top and then you
open it up oh you yeah I'm like this
little scenery this one only comes with
the better than sex mascara and then you
have your palette right here
it's so cute they put so much detail
into these you guys they're adorable so
but what really matters is the product
that's here oh this is what the palette
looks like I will say quickly the thing
I love about their holiday collection is
that they did do extravagant displays
for the products but you can still take
the pallets out like this and they're
travel-friendly they're slim easy to
work with they're not like this big
bulky thing that you don't know what to
do with you know I'm saying so this is
what this palette looks like absolutely
beautiful you have some gorgeous neutral
shades a pop of color really nice smoky
shades in here you have one two three
four four matte shades and one two three
four five six seven eight eight shimmer
shades you know a lot of great shades in
here one of my favorites is dream which
is this one right here it's like a mafia
brown but it's a mid-tone it's beautiful
yeah I really like these again I will
have all these swatched at the end of
the video and these have the same issue
with the fallout of the glitter so just
be careful but I love the array of
colors that you have here I think
they're stunning and then we have the
hunker here this is the pink box this
one's a little more expensive than the
lagrange oh this one is $58 a 378
values so has the same concept you just
opened it up and then what I am so in
this one you have a melted or you have a
Too Faced shadow insurance melted liquid
lipstick and peony and then you have the
better than sex mascara and then this
cute adorable set up like oh my god it's
so cute they have a little Sephora bag
how adorable and like that so then you
have the bigger palette so obviously you
get more in this set so that's why it's
more expensive I think with all of these
sets they're really great but it just
depends on the person that you're
shopping for and also how much money you
want to spend so this is this palette
this is probably my favorite palette out
of all them I love it a lot just because
it does have so many different shades in
here and it has blushes and highlights
it's really gorgeous so I'm gonna stop
talking and show you again I wish they
did have a mirror in here but can't let
them all once again but here are the
face shades down here you have a coral
of pink you have a core just like golden
highlight like let me show you this
right now I actually applied this
yesterday and I was so shocked because I
don't normally have high hopes for
highlighters and palettes like this but
this one is beautiful like the camera is
not doing it any justice it's just a
gorgeous golden glow it's not too
overdone it's not too shimmery it's
literally perfect and then you have Sun
bunny which is a bronzer right here up
at the top you have three eyeshadow
shades so this one is a yellow a matte
highlight a pink shimmery highlight and
a white matte highlight awesome awesome
awesome awesome and then in this one you
have one two three four matte shades
which are like a gorgeous mid-tone a
very warm brown you have a dark brown
matte and in a black matte what more do
you need in life like I don't even know
and then you have one two three four
five six seven eight nine ten eleven
shimmer shades with these shadows so
that's what it looks like again like I
said this is my favorite palette just
because I love the different colors in
here this is the one I used yesterday
and I love that I could pretty much do
my whole face with this palette and it
also used this blush yesterday which is
in the color Stardust and I
it was so pigmented it was a lot more
favorited than I expected because I put
it on and I was like oh I'm gonna have
to build a mess out because my cheeks
are so intense right now but it lasted
all day and I was so surprised by the
blushes and the highlighter the
Highlanders like one of my favorites I
personally really like this set I think
it's really great I do think two things
needs to work on their glitter shadows
because the fallout is just really bad I
mean it's it's intense but the colors
are beautiful let me show you some
shimmer eye shadows were like the colors
are really really beautiful it's just
the fallout is like what intense but as
long as you do your eyes before your
face you should be fine so that is it
for the Too Faced collection I hope you
guys enjoyed it they did send me this
stuff and I figured before I just put it
away and got like you know got rid of it
gave to people that I would show you
guys and let you kind of see them in
action because I know what the holiday
is coming up we don't like going out in
the stores we like looking online for
reviews bigger this will be helpful I
hope it was again if you want to see all
the swatches of these pallets just stay
till the end of the video and I will
show them to you and if you guys want me
to do more holiday collection reviews
let me know I'm always looking for a
reason to shop at Sephora so you just
