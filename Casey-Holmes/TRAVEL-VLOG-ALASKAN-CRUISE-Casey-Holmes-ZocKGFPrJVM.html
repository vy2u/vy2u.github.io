sometimes we have at 7:30 this morning
and we raise all the time yeah it felt
like six and we went and got massages we
got facials it's really good really
relaxing especially the facial I think
the facial more relaxing after in the
saw
like because the massage kind of loosen
you up and then you're just like
relaxing so we got those I got like a
laser treatment for redness and things
like that but now we're about policing
cornhole and hopefully we do good I
don't think it's that the wrong camera
