today is a new video for me something
different that I am trying and I want to
see how you guys like it so this is a
little series that I'm looking to try to
start if you guys enjoy it called try
this not that I personally love products
I regret buying and things I don't like
I love those kinds of videos but for me
I wanted to do something a little bit
more positive show you okay I didn't
like this but since I don't like this if
you want something like it you could try
this so you guys enjoyed this video I'm
so sorry my hair has not been brushed
we're about at 10 p.m. right now and I
don't know where my hairbrush is and I
don't feel like getting up and going and
buying the game but yeah I really hope
you guys enjoyed this video and enjoy
hearing a some of my favorite products
that you can replace with some that may
or may not be a hit or miss for you just
because something doesn't work out for
me obviously doesn't mean it won't work
out for you so feel free to try it at
your own risk
then the last thing I will say is just
because one product didn't work out for
me from that brand it doesn't mean the
brand sucks okay I know you brands are
watching this I know you are just
because one product didn't work out for
me doesn't mean I think you suck
otherwise I would say don't buy from
this brand because they suck you know
before we get started don't forget to
subscribe before you leave and also hit
that post notification bell so that
you're notified every single time I
upload a video if you guys are
interested on this makeup I just did a
full face of first impressions with
drugstore makeup that will probably be
up after this one so definitely keep an
eye out for I want to see all these
products then let's just go ahead and
get started so this isn't gonna go in
any particular order I'm just gonna kind
of pull and share with you guys the
first product I want to mention is if
this didn't work out for you like it
didn't work out for me
I have another option for you so this is
the makeup revolution fast base stick
foundation I can do a full wear test on
this if you guys want me to I was
actually going to do that but I really
wanted to get this video up so you know
I figured I would go ahead and throw
this in here but if you guys do want to
see that video I'll be more than happy
to do it just let me know in the
comments below and then like a comment
that says to do it so that I know you
want to see it these are just way too
creamy these are something where if you
have very oily skin I don't think you're
gonna like this this is just a little
too much for me it made me look like a
greaseball within a few minutes
had a video filmed with this and then I
just didn't upload the video because I
absolutely did not like the way it
turned out
my skin looked terrible in that video I
definitely think it's cuz its foundation
it was just a little too heavy for me
it's just too oily and it just didn't it
just didn't sit on my skin very well you
want to try stick foundation I do have
another option it is a high-end option
but it is the best stick foundation I
have ever tried in my life
it is the hourglass vanish stick
foundation if you've been following me
for a while you know I've mentioned this
so many times and it's a great full
coverage product it lasts all day this
is another product that I've mentioned
before that if you do have oily skin and
you're wanting to wear this in the
summertime I wouldn't necessarily wear
this to like an outside concert because
you know you will get very oily and it
will start to kind of look a little bit
cakey if you're not careful but this is
like a go-to kind of fall winter
foundation for me that I can wear
outside if I'm not sweating a lot or if
I do want to wear it in the summertime I
just make sure that I'm gonna be indoors
most of the time but I love the finish
of this it is just absolutely stunning
it's more of like a natural finish and
it really covers up everything so
beautifully doesn't accentuate your
texture your pores anything like that by
far my favorite stick foundation out
there so if this did not work for you
definitely go return it save up a few
more dollars and get the hourglass one
because this is a great alternative to
it if you have dry skin you might really
like this I haven't really seen that
many reviews on it so I don't really
know what people think about it
but for me it was definitely just a
little too heavy and oily and made me
look like a greaseball alright moving on
so next up for concealer this is a
really popular one that a lot of people
really loved but again I think it's just
because my skin type and different
problems that I have coz we all have
different skin types all have different
skin textures and just things that we're
looking for in products as well so the
product that didn't work out for me is
the BH Cosmetics Studio Pro total
coverage concealer this was so heavy on
me like oh I could not make this work I
could not make this work it was just too
oily too greasy it just didn't work out
well for me at all I could kind of tell
to when I first took it out I was like
oh this looks like it's not gonna work
for me because it is very like dewy
to be very careful on what kind of
concealers that I use as I do take my
concealer down here onto my cheek just
to add a little bit more coverage over
my redness and I find that it helps
prolong the aware of my foundation -
like the coverage and everything so
that's why I like to do it but anyways
so I do take my concealer down quite a
bit to help cover up that redness and
also kind of highlight that area and
this just did not work in my t-zone
whatsoever I didn't find that it really
covered up that much as well it just
wasn't my favorite but the one that I
recommend trying if that didn't work out
for you either you're just looking for a
great drugstore concealer is definitely
this flower beauty light lusion
concealer I thought this was gonna be
kind of like that like super dewy and
just not work for my oily skin but I was
pleasantly surprised this has such great
coverage but it's more like on the matte
side it's like a natural matte kind of
finish it's definitely not dewy at all
on my skin and it lasts for such a long
time and it just looks really beautiful
it's one of my favorite drugstore
concealers it's actually my top favorite
drugstore concealer at the moment there
hasn't been anything to really top this
so I love it definitely try this out if
you're having a hard time with this one
or just any drugstore concealer in
general because it is good moving on -
okay what do I owe this let me talk
about this for a second so this is a
cover FX shimmervale and this is in any
color I've tried a couple of these and
they all do the same exact thing and
I'll put it on and first off it's hard
to apply I did a video where I was
actually like I think it was a chitchat
get ready with me I was talking to you
guys applying this and it was so
difficult to put on like and to make it
look seamless and just really beautiful
and blended so right off the bat I was
like oh I don't think I'm gonna like
this and I didn't do it update on that
video but if I did I would have came
back on camera later that evening and
you wouldn't have seen any shimmer on my
eyes like I don't ever touch my eyes
during the day and this was completely
gone completely gone within a few hours
I even told a was always like it just
did like it was literally a disappearing
act I was like where did this go instead
of spending your money on this I
recommend buying the Stila where these
called
magnificent metal
glitter and glow now these are a little
bit more of a chunky kind of glitter
this is definitely more of like a
shimmer Sheen but if you just want that
really sparkly effect go for this
because it's gonna last all day it looks
so beautiful it's easy to apply I feel
like you can't go wrong with these guys
they are by far my favorite like liquid
glitter they just look so beautiful and
they last all day so if you're gonna
invest
I recommend the Stila ones I mean I may
have done something wrong with this one
I don't know but it definitely didn't
last on my lids at all with a primer or
anything just didn't work for me for
blush I have this benefit gold rush so
the reason why this is in here is just
because I don't like the color of it it
can work for people with more fair skin
for sure you have like a medium skin
tone this would be a nice kind of flush
for you but for me it's just way too
light like it barely shows up at all but
I like the idea of it like I like the
idea of this color you know what I mean
I like this color scheme so instead I
recommend trying out this coqui blush up
blush palette and I like it because this
has like the same idea as this but it's
just more pigmented it's gonna show up
on your skin if you're like medium to
tan or even deeper skin tones because
this one's a little bit darker but I
don't know if you guys can really tell
with the lighting but they kind of have
that same idea mainly these two this one
on the end and this right here but
mixing a little bit of this color in
with this shade gives you something like
this but it's just a little bit deeper
does that make any sense like I feel
like if you want more color payoff but
you like the look of this get this one
you can mix these two shades to kind of
get this color this also is more of like
a mob in here as well if you wanted to
use something like that this is great
has really good color payoff looks good
on the skin lasts all day this one I
just need it a little bit more from it
even though that's really really good
this is the next thing this is a laura
mercier secret brightening powder for
under eyes and I just do not like the
way this lips underneath my eyes first
of all I don't really like powders like
this anyways for underneath my eyes
because this gives me so much flashback
and flash photography because it's such
a white finely milled powder that it
just like really reflects with the flash
I don't like this but if you do want to
brighten up your under eyes and
I recommend trying out these k'kaw
brighten up powders I think they are so
good and these seriously brighten up
your face I've used them in so many
different videos they've been in my
favorites videos and they're just so
good and I think they look great in
flash photography so this is the shade
number three I use this all the time as
well as this shade number two which is
more of a peachy color so it's gonna
depend on what you want to use more I
kind of go back and forth with both I
love them equally I think they're both
great
they really do highlight the skin they
also set that concealer in place as well
I just think it's a better alternative
to this because this for me just it's
just too white and too intense for my
flash photography next thing is actually
with lip liners so there is a brand of
lip liner that I tried this is and I
actually just try to lip liner from them
in my drugstore video and it's really
good but this one sucked so bad this is
the jcat beauty rocker chick Velvet
Touch waterproof gel lip liner I don't
know if I got bad ones that could be
what it is this dried out my lips so bad
like I was so uncomfortable wearing this
like I it was so dry and not comfortable
whatsoever to wear and I have so many
lip liner favorites that I kind of was
just like okay goodbye and I went back
to my other drugstore favorites so
Pilate oh I have raved about their lip
liners for so long they have some of the
best lip liners that you need to try
because our amazing Gingerbread who
remembers Gingerbread let me know in the
comments that's one of my absolute
favorite also flower Beauty has awesome
lip liners as well essence has really
great lip liners honestly the drugstore
has a lot of great lip liners that you
don't have to go buy high-end or
anything like that to get a good color a
lot of these lip liners - like these
brands right here at least I know you
can use them as your actual lip color so
they're so creamy that you can line your
lips but also fill them in and wear them
throughout the day as a regular lipstick
or bronzer my not this product is the
Too Faced unicorn treat tears almost a
tree's bronzer right here and honestly
this whole collection just wasn't my
vibe but then again none of the mermaid
or unicorn collections really are my
thing I just don't find them practical
though I didn't really like this bronzer
mainly because
this lavender part right here if that
wasn't in there I would probably like it
I do feel like it's a little more on the
orange side and it is pretty dark so
this is the iridescent mystical bronzer
first off I don't really like things
that are iridescent this didn't work out
for you but you want that really
gorgeous bronze glow I recommend this
Becca sunlit bronzer in Capri coast this
will give you that same effect I know on
camera right now at least to me it looks
like it's matte but it does have a nice
Sheen to it but if you're looking for
something that's gonna give you a really
nice bronzed glow definitely go for this
or you could just go for the butter
bronzer in the deepest shade which is
what I'm using right now and oh my gosh
it's gonna be so hard to top that
another thing is this amused cosmetics a
foundation it's the matte finish
foundation that I tried from the shop
miss a thing that I did this was just
ugly on my skin it did not flatter my
texture my oils it was not a good
mattifying foundation whatsoever if
you're looking for a great affordable
mattifying foundation something that's
gonna look amazing on the skin
definitely get that la girl pro matte
foundation this is one of my favorites
it makes your skin look flawless like
incredibly flawless and I was just
thinking today because I made the
covergirl foundation video live I was
like oh my god what if I mix that with
this I think they will be so pretty
together so I'm gonna try that and keep
you updated but this is a great
affordable mattifying foundation you
don't need to mix this with anything it
is absolutely stunning on its own next
up we have a shadow palette so my not
favorite is the Catrice cosmetics the
modern matte collection eyeshadow
palette oh my god this is just dull and
boring and bland and I mean I get it
people love these color do not be
offended if I just like dogged your
favorite product I'm sorry but to me
this is just boring I don't I don't get
it and applying it to the eyes I feel
like there's barely any color payoff you
can barely do everything with this
palette I don't know I just find it very
boring so instead I recommend the makeup
revolution ultra eye contour light and
shade palette so you still get some of
those cool tone shades in there
these are definitely more pigmented and
I feel like you could do a few more
looks with
all of these colors in here I believe
yes all of these colors in here are
matte so these are as well and you just
have some other shades to kind of play
with and create different looks and
you're gonna get some dimension in there
with the blacks and the deeper colors
but you also have those lighter shades
as well you can also use these contour
and highlight shades on your eyes if you
wanted to this one with more variety and
better color paths it's just a better
option than this one but then again if
it works for you it works for you so I
do love these two brands very much and
I'm surprised I don't like this product
that I'm going to share with you so this
is the tartlet toasted palette now I
don't completely just like this palette
my thing is there's so much fallout with
it that it makes it difficult to work
with and it's just not my favorite warm
tone palette like I was gonna compare
this to like a Natasha Genoa palette
like I was gonna say definitely get the
sunset palette I was looking through my
drawer trying to find a better
alternative than this one this is not a
complete ship palette but it's
definitely not my favorite I don't know
I just feel like there's way too much
fallout it's just nothing super crazy
amazing I love the other tartlet
palettes I think they're beautiful but
this one I was excited for but I just
think there's better ones out there like
the Urban Decay Naked heat palette now
let me tell you when I was going through
my drawers to kind of see what was a
better alternative when you got more
shades you get a lot of the same shades
with these two palettes I don't know if
y'all noticed I don't know I'm late I
guess too because dark kind of purple
brown is ashes in the urban decay and
fireside in here they're pretty dang
similar I mean you get a lot of the same
shades so there's twelve shades in both
I like the way this one blends better
and it doesn't have a lot of fallout so
if you do like these kind of colors go
for the Urban Decay Naked heat I like
the color payoff a little bit better
there's not as much fallout and I just
like the variety better in this one I
don't know I think it just looks a
little bit better so that's my opinion
they're very similar there's twelve
shades in both and the last thing I want
to mention to you guys is lip products I
tried out these makeup
evolution Matt lipglosses you definitely
more of a matte liquid lip I don't even
see these as a matte gloss because
L'Oreal came out with matte glosses and
I could see where they were going with
it this is definitely a liquid lipstick
this is not a matte gloss in my opinion
whatsoever and it's very drying so just
FYI satifying this you could if you
wanted the matte gloss effect totally go
by the l'oreal ones if they still have
them out I'm not sure I think they had
like a whole line of matte lip glosses
at one point but again I can't guarantee
they still have them but instead you
could try out some other amazing lip
products this is my collab with claudio
you guys this is a custom made formula
this is something that i worked hard on
this lasts all day it's comfortable to
wear the three shades that are available
are beautiful they go to so many
different skin tones so many different
looks highly recommend them they're just
some of the best liquid lips and I
continue to wear them to this day
because I'm obsessed with them if you
want to check them out I'll leave a link
down below for them definitely these are
like my top liquid lip another great
liquid lip is from ardell this is the
nude photo Matt whipped lipstick I
really like it because it's comfortable
it doesn't last a super long time like
the Palladio ones that we have but this
does last pretty well but once you start
to eat food it will kind of come off
because it's more of a whipped formula
it's not like a matte liquid lip so just
keep that in mind but this could be kind
of like your matte gloss if you wanted
it to be you know what I'm saying that
is all the products I want to mention to
you at this time I really hope you guys
enjoyed it if you did definitely give it
a thumbs up and let me know down below
in the comments what you guys thought I
had so much fun filming it honestly it's
definitely fun for me to go through my
bag bin and kind of see like what I
didn't like and if I had any
alternatives that were very similar but
just performed better so that was all of
my recommendations so thank you guys so
much again for watching don't forget to
subscribe before you leave and hit that
post notification bell so you don't miss
out on my next video and I will see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
