today I'm gonna be testing out some new
high-end makeup that I'm really excited
about some of this was sent to me some
of it about myself and I figured I would
just put it all in one video so we could
try it all out this is not a full face
of first impressions but I do have quite
a bit of stuff in my little bag box
thing we have duo chrome top coat from
Natasha de Nonna we also have her new
palette
we just got lots of goodies in here is
what this video is going to be on I hope
you guys are excited a to watch it I
want to see how all these products
perform then let's just go ahead and get
started so we are going to be trying a
new eyeshadow palette it did purchases
myself off of Sephora and it is the
Natasha Danone atrophic palette I saw us
on Instagram first and I was like oh my
gosh that is so pretty the lash natascha
denoted I showed a palette that I had
that this one is like it's gone bad in
my opinion it doesn't perform the same
as when I first got it is this star
palette and these are not cheap palettes
this one has a 12 month lifespan eat
green Brown palette which is one of my
all-time favorite palettes actually I
don't know when this expires because it
doesn't say on the packaging but you can
see how much I've used it it's pretty
beat-up one of my favorite palettes but
again it just kind of doesn't perform to
say the sunset palette does last 24
months too so that's good and this one
is saying it does last 24 months so we
will see we will see but I love this
palette it's so summery and beautiful
and it just really draws my eye but it
is very expensive here's what the
packaging looks like it's just a 10 it
looks like you could pop out the
eyeshadows if you wanted to I don't know
why you would because it's expensive but
if you wanted to pop it out it looks
like you can get 5 10 15 different
shades you have a mixture of matte and
shimmer shades this way when I swatch
mint frost I expect something like ultra
intense but to me it's not especially
this green going into the sunset palette
I look at the mint frost which is this
one it looks very similar to something
like this in the sunset palette and this
one's just like intense like a foil very
creamy but the mint Frost one just isn't
giving it to me and I know they look
really pretty which they are but if you
look up close - you can
really see my skin peeking through there
I do kind of feel like Natasha de Nonna
has changed up her formula I did
purchase one of those five pan palettes
and wasn't a big fan of it actually it's
not one of my favorites which was crazy
for me that was the first time I really
noticed a formula change and then I also
feel like it's changing in this one too
we'll see how I like this one it does
have a really big mirror which is nice
and this packaging is just really cute
to me I think it's nice I'm just gonna
take this peach perfect powder from Too
Faced and set my lid there's not like a
just plain cream shade and something
I'll just set my lid with a translucent
powder or any kind of powder because I
have oily eyelids so I need something to
set that primer with or else it is going
to be a mess at the end to here I'm
going to first take the shade pastel
melon which is this one right here and
I'm gonna fluff this into my crease kind
of just all over this is gonna be one of
our transition shades leading up to the
brow bone and so far the matte looks
really good and I literally just put it
on my eye but it kind of just blended
effortlessly like it's blended it took
no time at all so I'm going to go one
with Sahara right here it's a little bit
more of cuz Sahara right here and fake
tan look really similar but fake tan is
definitely more pinky Sahara is more
yellow I want to take the more yellow
one because I love yellow taking a sigma
e40 I'm gonna take the Hara and just put
this right underneath that first shade
we use because it is just a bit darker
but not too much so we're just gonna
gradually build up this crease and make
sure we have good transition shades
since we are going in with super
colorful colors now I'm going to take
the shade Laguna this is a really
intense blue it just looks absolutely
beautiful I haven't swatch the shade yet
so we will see how it performs on the
eyes ooh that is looking pretty I'm
gonna put this into the crease wow you
guys that is really pretty it's coming
off much darker on my eye than I
expected so see it looks really light
and bright in the
pan but it's kind of coming off as like
a blue brain on my eye
could be because of the crease colors -
I don't know so we're putting this like
right into the socket and a little bit
above I hope nobody rings my doorbell
because I'm not coming down okay it's
pretty it seems like again it's blending
really well I am just gonna go back in
with that first brush we used and
there's no extra product on here I'm
just going to lightly blend the edges
just so they're not harsh or anything
you know they look so pretty together
I'm kind of loving it I'm gonna take
Tigerlily which is a really pretty
shimmery shade but I want to use this to
deepen up the outer V so I'm just gonna
put my brush in here does not look very
pigmented
I'll try this brush that is a little bit
more dense this is the Mac 239 this
should pick up a lot of product and put
this in the outer V I actually don't
know how I feel about that Tigerlily
color and it's like one of those shades
I was looking forward to using okay see
like this this little section doesn't
want to blend alright let's just cut
this crease and then we'll fix the rest
of this using Tarte shape tape in
light/medium and also the mac 242 brush
i'm going to carve out my lid
I'm really carving this out and going a
little bit above my crease cuz my hood
my hood my eyelids kind of fold over and
bending it backwards so this one was
kind of messy but it'll be alright now
I'm gonna go in with mint frost which is
this really pretty minty frosty color
and I'm gonna put this wherever I put
that concealer see it's coming off on
the brush really nicely though that's
good it didn't like swatch the best on
my hand but
I'm just trying to really carve out that
crease that is pretty Wow
like somebody you're gonna be happy I
didn't do like a super warm toned look
even though I was tempted as you can
tell you could also use these warm tone
shades in here to do a regular warm
toned look but then just have like a pop
of blue on the lower lash line or a pop
of green would be so pretty let me go
back in with Tiger Lily which is that
really deep beautiful blue that's not
really performing how I wish and I'm
just going to go back in here and kind
of blend the edges so they blend
together maybe okay we're not going to
use that shade to try to blend out
anymore because it's not working so I'm
gonna wipe that off that brush I'm
actually gonna go in with Laguna that
really bright blue and see if that'll
help blend it all so we're just gonna go
right between the two and blend it out
certainly better if you just try to
blend it out with a matte shade instead
of the really pretty deep blue I kind of
wish I didn't but that deep blue right
there because it doesn't want to blend I
think it looks really nice I was gonna
try to use this duochrome coat from her
because I've never used these before but
this is in green Brown I believe let me
know you guys like teases just wouldn't
go with this look but let me know how
you guys like to use this I'm not sure
what to top it on you know like how do
people use this it's already cracking
very pretty for summer spring
so now I'm gonna do is actually go in
with some lashes these are meek Miami
from Lily lashes and I don't know Miami
tropic palate they kind of just go
together I'm going to cut these apply
them and then we will move on to these
products got lashes on and I'm really
liking the way the eye shadow looks
right now I'm gonna do now is just spray
my Smashbox primer water I love this
primer water just because it feels
really good hydrates my skin without
making me oil like a lot of people don't
know why I love this but literally it
makes me feel hydrated but I'm not
greasy and just like gross it doesn't
leave a film it just sinks in it
refreshes it's just so good today we're
gonna be using the touches silk canvas
filter finish protective a primer I'm
going to put this on my fingers and then
massage it into my t-zone and work my
way out
Marc Jacobs remarkable full coverage
foundation do you guys never want to
used to love this and I just have not
used it and so long this has been my
drawer so this is the shade 34 beige
medium and it tells you to shake it up
this might be too dark for me but I did
bring out my Catrice lightening drops so
we'll see if I need to use that but you
just take off the lid and then you have
this little stick in here so I'm just
gonna put this on the back of my hand I
love this brush it's the heavenly luxe a
flat top buffing brush and number six
this is such a good brush we're just
gonna apply this on okay I'm glad I
didn't mix any lightening drops because
it definitely didn't really need them I
actually feel like I'm using more than I
thought it would cuz I'm almost out on
my hand but I remember not needing this
much foundation alright maybe maybe not
hold on let me let me quit talking ahead
okay I'm just kind of pressing in with
my brush too I feel like now I love Mac
foundations but I love certain ones I
don't love all of them
because they can be really drying they
can look cakey like I go through phases
I liked the Kat Von D one but now I feel
like it's too heavy you know there's
just certain foundations I'm like oh
that looks kind of heavy on my skin and
but I used to really love that I think
it is important to kind of go through
and try out new your products again that
you recommend it for the longest time
and just see if you still really like
them and see if they're worth the money
all of that covered my entire face
definitely didn't need more I'm glad I
didn't put more on my hand because I
definitely didn't need any more this is
what it looks like it's a little too
light for me and again this one's the
shade 34 beige medium but that has
coverage you guys coverage it doesn't
look a little heavy I'm just gonna wait
and see how I feel so I'm always going
to try this but I've just been a little
bit nervous
it's the Becca under-eye brightening
corrector and all reason I've been
nervous is because it feels kind of
greasy so I'm really going to take a
little bit of this and focus it right at
the darkest parts of my eye I mean it is
creamy and one of those things that I
could not bring down on my cheek because
it would make me so early and to be
honest with you when I use full coverage
concealers I don't need things like this
but I just wanted to try it for so long
I got a bunch of different concealers in
today from ex1 and oh my gosh you guys I
used to love the ex1 foundation I don't
even know where that foundation went I
think it just got old and I threw it
away and never repurchased but I got the
most random package from them today and
I'm really excited it's the delete fluid
concealer available in 13 different
shades it's gonna be $15 you could get
on ASOS looks fantastic urban retreat
Harrods and Amazon but basically it says
it's developed to pack a punch in the
coverage sticks by deleting acne dark
marks shadows and or redness without
looking overdone the delete fluid
concealer heals while it conceals thanks
to the antioxidant properties of vitamin
E this is the packaging right here kind
of looks like a Mac which you call it a
long wear concealer see if this is my
shade they take a little bit of this
super light one which is in one so I'm
going to be
between one and five that's for sure and
I'm just gonna mix these together and
put them underneath my eyes I'll be
honest I haven't used like a pump
concealer and so long that it's kind of
weird to go in with my finger and apply
this but you know it's okay that is very
yellow I feel like these shades are
either yellow or very very warm okay
we're gonna take this one this one's the
shade 3.5 so I'm gonna use my finger to
apply this right underneath my eyes I'm
gonna do it one at a time so then I'm
gonna take this tart sponge I remember
what it's call up at a guy in a PR
package I'm just gonna blend this out it
feels nice it feels nice and squishy
doesn't like bad definitely cover it up
some extra darkness that I have and it
doesn't look heavy on the skin it's
actually a really creamy looking like
I'm gonna have to set the crap out of it
so far it's okay I don't feel like it's
super full coverage but I do think it
has like medium to full coverage yeah I
think the Marc Jacobs full coverage
foundation really helped conceal a lot
so this concealer would work well with
that foundation but in my opinion it's
definitely not like not super full
coverage but it looks pretty underneath
the eyes okay and then I'm going to take
the lighter shade 1.0 and I just scored
it a little bit of that out and I'm
gonna highlight my face with this and
I'm gonna put this here here doesn't
seem like it dries fast so we should
have time to blend this out I'm gonna
take it in here so weird to be using my
fingers so I don't use my fingers in so
long see it really blends so
effortlessly I feel like it blends
really well cuz it is more like a medium
coverage concealer alright so now we're
gonna go ahead and set this concealer
I'm just going to use my Too Faced
peach perfect powder to set everything
and I'm just gonna go ahead and start
doing the rest of my face feel like this
powder makes any foundation look good
like look at this look at how smooth and
filtered this powder makes you look
isn't that crazy bronzer I'm gonna go
back to an oldie but a goodie this is
the
Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer and just
what looks like such a good bronzer it's
like a classic shade it's super warm
very nice and then I'm gonna go in with
my benefit hoola bronzer which I've been
really enjoying lately to contour my
cheeks need a little bit of bronzer over
here so I'm just gonna look at that now
we're gonna go in with this pur
four-in-one
blush palette there we go this is new as
you guys can see I'm gonna be using this
shade right here
it does look like they have some shimmer
to them so they might add a highlight to
your cheek so I'm just gonna start from
the back and work my way forward because
I don't know how the shimmer will look
on my texture so I'm gonna take
determined which is that peachy color
I'll never use this one but I will
definitely probably dabble into those at
some point these are huge pans I'm just
gonna work from the back go forward very
pigmented kind of looks like a bronzer
okay so now I have two different NARS
highlighters I don't know which one I
want to use there's a for two de France
which looks so very pretty actually this
is the one I'll use so since Fort de
France and this one's Ibiza which is
more golden highlight
this is pretty this looks like a
gorgeous glow it's definitely not as
intense as the drugstore highlighters
that I've been loving but this gives you
like a soft like luminous glow like I
really like it it looks very pretty it's
very smooth so I'm gonna fill my brows
of my regular brow products these are
the Catrice slim addict ultra precise
brow products pencils pencils i actually
ran out of this and they sent me a bunch
of them so thank you guys so much to
Catrice for sending these out to me but
I use the shade medium and light I use
medium on the outer parts and like on
the inner parts so now we're going back
into that palette and I'm going to take
the shade Tiger Lily
this really pretty color I had a hard
time blending out earlier we're really
gonna press that color up against that
lower lash line so I'm just gonna use
Sahara again this one right here blend
out that color with a Mac to 619 219
okay now moving on to lips I'm just
going to use the Patrick Starr
edge-to-edge lip pencil
I'm gonna go in with the two-faced candy
Johnson melted matte liquid lip in and
melted ice cream I don't know if this is
still out I have a lot of that collab
stuffs not sure if it's still out but
it's a really nice light pink nude super
light thought this would be darker so I
figured I could highlight in the inner
part with this that was Mac retro lip
and burnt spice and then I went in the
center with the Too Faced and melted ice
cream in the middle for an ombre look
and matte I think a matte lip goes a
little bit better with this look it
could just be me so that is the entire
look you guys I really love how this
makeup look turned out I have to say I
don't know if I'm a big fan of the
foundation I definitely feel like it
looks a little heavy like my preferences
have kind of changed over the years so I
don't know I still like the LA girl one
a little bit better I also don't know if
I'll use that concealer a lot not my
favorite um the lip combo I have on
right now I actually really enjoy them I
actually I might do this more because I
like the ombre look or this eye shadow
palette is the most expensive thing in
this video I do really like it even
though I feel like the formula has
changed I feel like the look came out
great I feel like that's what sucks me
and when Natasha Genoa it's like it's so
expensive but holy she had like the best
eye look at her when you're done it's
just crazy I like it I love the end
result of this even though I feel like
the really deep blue was kind of hard to
blend out for me I hope you guys enjoyed
this video in this makeup look I think
it's one my favorite ones to date it's
just I keep it's like mesmerizing me
honestly you like this shade right here
is just like I can't stop looking at
thank you guys so much for watching if
you like this video don't forget to give
it a thumbs up and I will see you guys
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
