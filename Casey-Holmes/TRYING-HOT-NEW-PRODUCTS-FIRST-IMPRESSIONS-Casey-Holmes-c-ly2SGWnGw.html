to be doing a full face of first
impressions and I love these videos I
love these videos I love them I just
think they're so fun and entertaining so
I will continue to do them I know some
people don't like them because you don't
really get like a full in-depth review
but I'm definitely one of those people
who feels like I can try something and
know if I'm gonna like it or not
and if I'm in-between that's what I'll
keep trying it out I mean some things
just don't make it even to the YouTube
channel because I'm like oh hell no I
really feel like I'm in touch with my
makeup soul and I just know if something
works for me and if it doesn't that's
we're gonna do today I have a ton of
stuff here I have some stuff from morphe
that I actually purchased from Ulta
because I don't work with morphe at all
so I don't get like PR or anything and I
really wanted to try some stuff out and
they're on Ulta now which is great
because all the points so if you guys
are interested in seeing this full face
of first impressions definitely keep
watch TV sure to hit that post
notification bell before you leave as
well so you're notified every single
time that I upload a video so if you
want to see me put all this stuff on my
face then let's just go ahead and get
started
also if you're wondering you guys will
probably see my top throughout this
video it's from Target and I really like
it I think it's cute I had medium I
could've gone with the small but they
didn't have any I just thought it was so
cute that I had to have it so I'm gonna
use my Dior no rinse cleanser and I'm
just going to go ahead and cleanse my
face before I put on this mask because I
really do not feel like washing my face
right now I'm gonna have to do it
anyways with the masks I'm gonna have to
like rinse it all off whoo my skin is
dirty it got dirty already I haven't
really done much all I've done has
worked out I didn't sweat that much so
oh also guys I went to the dermatologist
today this is like an ongoing thing
between us we just talked about my life
so that's what's gonna happen so I went
to dermatologists today just have like a
follow-up and kind of we could do about
this rosacea I mean it doesn't bother me
my doctor that I saw first told me that
I should see the dermatologist for my
rosacea and I was like okay fine
whatever so I went in today and we
talked about laser and I'm gonna get my
first laser treatment I'm like excited
I'm nervous and I'm interested to see
what its gonna look like because I've
told you guys before like I'm so used to
seeing myself with rosacea
like I don't know how I'm gonna feel if
like this stuff works and I have no
redness anymore you know what I'm saying
like it's become a part of me which is
weird I'm definitely not saying getting
rid of redness what the hell is going on
here so yeah I'm excited for that I'm a
little bit nervous cuz it can be painful
they like gave me a numbing cream to put
on 30 minutes for coming to my appointee
I know it's not gonna probably be all
gone in the first round of lasers even
the doctor told me that but like if we
continue doing this in the redness goes
away I'm like so curious of how I look
at myself you know what I mean like well
I stopped using full coverage
foundations let me tell you I did not
think going into this appointment today
that I was gonna get laser like that was
not my plan at all it just worked out
that way so I'm excited to see what
happens and see how many treatments it
takes for me to turn this redness down
so today I'm gonna be taking the Olay
Olay hendrickson sorry if I said that
wrong this is the cold plunge pore mask
it says it deeply purifies pores and
reduces oil with clay and snow Lotus
extracts so I was actually going to
purchase this product and then I got it
in the mail and PR like right before I
was about to order it and I was like yes
because I wanted to try it so bad it
just sounds like something I would
really love just sounds really cool I
like the packet they did provide like
this little brush in here I normally
don't use brushes but I'm gonna use it
today since it did come with the mask
and if you haven't seen this everywhere
it's like a really pretty bright
turquoise blue and I go ahead and what
am I gonna do am I gonna put it on the
brush am I gonna put it on the back of
my hand okay so I'm just gonna put this
on the brush but we're just gonna paint
this on ooh that smells really good I
wouldn't recommend getting that close to
your I didn't mean to it's just this
brush is so big really in a masks right
now and sheet mask sheet masks are great
we could you under rinse anything off
I've also been really into the dr. jart
rubber masks I really love the one that
you can like shake up yourself that's
one that Davis and I do a lot whenever I
order it and he enjoys doing it too it's
kind of like a sign his project we
really like doing that one it's just fun
did you get to mix everything up and
then it turns into like rubber on your
face and you just peel it off it's so
easy okay so the mask is on and it says
to leave on for 15 minutes which it is
503 now so five eight then it says add
cool water to lather and rinse off and
then you can follow off with your
our serum blah blah blah yeah I'm gonna
go ahead and do this I just really
wanted to do a mask before my makeup
I've also been loving I masks which you
guys have seen multiple times the ones
from Erno law slow I'm gonna go ahead
and let this sit and then I'll be back
and we will move on to the okay guys so
I just took the mask off and I applied
my skincare so I did use my drunk
elephant see from a day serum I also use
the belief moisturizing eye balm and
then I used in my Dermalogica active
moist moisturizer really great products
and yeah my skin feels really good it
feels nice and plump I don't see like a
huge difference I don't know if people
see a big difference after they use this
but it felt really good don't get this
in your eyes don't get it in your eyes
when you're rinsing it off because it
hurts like a bee okay so I have a few
eyeshadow palettes that I can use today
but I haven't decided which ones to you
we have this NYX eyeshadow palette this
came out forever ago I don't even know
if it's available anymore so I'll know
if I should even talk about that the LA
colors a sweet 16 I shadow palette then
I also have the city mini palette and
this one's the like chill brunch
neutrals which kind of looks similar to
some shades in here like this bottom row
but I'm gonna use LA Colors one first
and like I said I am going to use my
regular primer so I'm just gonna use my
Smashbox lip primer just because I want
to see how well they perform on top for
the first shade I'm going to be taking
is in this color palette and I'm gonna
be taking this one which is a little bit
more yellow this one's definitely more
peach this one's more yellow and I'm
going to set my entire lip with this
color does have some kick up if you guys
can see I think I'm gonna focus more on
this bottom row here I really like it
cuz I just did a blue look not too long
ago and these colors really aren't
calling my name so I'm just gonna focus
on these so I'm going to take this shade
right here and I'm gonna put that into
my crease with this fluffy brush so just
put that in the crease it's an okay
color it's something crazy I thought it
would be a little more pigmented than
what it is
I might mix a little bit of this
Maybelline palette in here as well we're
gonna see how these colors perform I'm
gonna go in with this shade and I'm
gonna put this into my crease as well
right on top of that first color see
that's what I was expecting right there
a little bit more intense as I like them
about to do is probably not gonna match
my shirt but it'll be okay now what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna go into the LA
girl palette and I'm going to take this
shade right here with a fluffy blending
brush and we're gonna put this in the
outer V and into the crease and we're
also gonna take it right here in the
inner corner okay we're gonna try to
build this up
okay now what I'm going to do is I'm
gonna go into this Maybelline one and
take this really deep purple and put
this in the outer V just to deepen it up
a little bit more so I'm gonna press it
right here and just work this out
like all of this will be cleaned up so
don't worry this I turned out a little
bit better okay so what we're gonna do
is there's not really like a black or a
deep shade that I can use for the outer
V other than that purple so we're just
gonna move on to the center of the list
once a wet and wild cat suit a liquid
eyeshadow and cashmere love I'm gonna
put this on the back of my hand first
and then apply it and I'm gonna do this
eye without concealer down this eye
maybe with concealer so we're gonna
first do it without concealer and see
how it looks and then decide if we
should put concealer down or not really
pretty cool tone shade you guys wanted
cool tones so here you go you know and
we're going to just apply this on the
lid it is really pretty but it doesn't
have a lot of like a base color to it
it's just a lot of shimmers so what I
want to do is go into this palette with
Maybelline and take this color and see
if I can put that on top to really make
it pop and make it nice and opaque on
that lid so I'm going to use the same
brush with the same amount of product on
it and since it is a little bit wet it's
gonna pick up quite a bit and I just
wanna see if it looks like on top that
is pretty gives it more of like a
gunmetal shade you can also apply with
the applicator if you wanted to I like
to be a little bit more precise and use
a brush it's my personal preference
I'm gonna go in with the blending brush
we used and I'm gonna go into that
Maybelline shade and take this darker
purple and then where you're gonna Fleck
us out in the outer V again and just
blend it into this color so that it's
nice and seamless so I'm gonna do this
one first so I'm just going a little bit
over the edges with the color I
definitely like the Maylene palette a
little bit more than the LA Colors one
cuz I feel like you get more color
payoff do have a new liquid eyeliner
from makeup revolution that I ordered
this is the liquid eyeliner pen and it
comes in packaging like this
that's nice it went over all this
shimmer and eyeshadow that we have on
like beautifully it just like smooths
over so so far so good it is more of a
stiff felt tip so if you're trying to do
a wing and you're trying to just like
gradually bring it in it might be a
little bit difficult what I'm gonna do
now is apply lashes and then I'll be
back and we will move on to our face
okay guys so I have my lashes on I just
put on some Lily lashes and a mink Miami
and now we're gonna put on foundation
but first I'm gonna use my primers so
like I told you guys I'm gonna use the
Smashbox primer water and as well as the
touch' silk canvas primer I just want to
try what I normally use with this so I'm
going to be using in this makeup
revolution stick foundation it's called
the fast base stick foundation I have
the shades f10 and f7 so we'll see what
color I am with myself tan oh also by
the way if you purchase makeup
revolution I don't know when this video
is up but they're having free gifts at
Ulta which is great because I got the
free gift and it was a lot of stuff is
nine dollars this is only at Ulta and
makeup revolution calm is what the
website is saying and it says - oh they
don't really have a description either
it just says to turn twist up swipe on
and blend out with fingers abuse punch
or your favorite foundation brush
normally with stick foundations I do
like to use a brush but I will try a
brush and a sponge today and I do have a
new sponge today to try from morphe I've
heard so many people talk about this for
years and I just never tried it out so I
figured hey I'm gonna try that today
very creamy and then this one's this
shade like it's so creamy look at that I
really didn't press down that hard and
then this one's the shade f7 so we're
definitely gonna be more f10 but I think
I'll put f7 to like highlight underneath
my eyes a bit so put f10 here wow this
is like super creamy that I'm not I'm
not pressing down hard it's just like
don't sing into the skin first
impression is this feels a lot like
applying it this feels a lot like the
hourglass vanish stick foundation and
put this like right in here just to kind
of highlight that face you can almost
just dot this on instead of rubbing it
because it's so creamy that is just kind
of like getting pushed down even though
I'm not trying to do that
this little morphe flat brush we're
gonna blend this out
oh talking mushrooms if we have an
hourglass dip here
first off love the color combo of doing
that I absolutely love the shade f10 I
think that is like what am i perfect
like getting out of myself tan shade
because I haven't really applied it in a
while this is looking so good oh oh my
gosh I haven't seen any reviews on this
foundation at all I just I saw that it
was a thing and I purchased it on Ulta
because I've wanted to try it out but
what no one's talking about this right
now I will say it's looking a little bit
crazy right in here like it looks a
little heavy again use this morphe
sponge so applying it with the sponge
and first off I feel like I don't know
there's something about stick
foundations it's just so much easier to
blend out with a brush just my preferred
way to apply and I'm also used to have
sponges at the size of Texas so I mean
like I usually get my face done in like
five seconds another thing I will say I
was thinking about this when I was in
the bathroom is that this does remind me
of the hourglass foundation with the
coverage but also the finish but this
one is a little bit more do here than
the hourglass one because the hourglass
one is not something that I would wear
on is the hot summer day it just
wouldn't be but it does have great
coverage for like event and stuff like
that and it just looks really good but
this one does look
really nice so far I didn't think this
would be asked full coverage as it is
but it's got some cover job since this
foundation is going pretty strong and
doing well so far I do want to use my
same concealers but I do have new
products for other things so I am just
going to use my regular concealer so we
can see how it looks in the end with
this I'm going to use Tarte shape tape
right in here as always and then the
k'kaw on the rest of my face
so I do want to try the makeup
revolution one-step contour stick and
this was one of the free gifts that I
got for wearing the foundation so I'm
gonna try this out I'll just use the
edge of it I never cream contour so this
could go really bad I'm a little nervous
to do the sides my nose so I'll just
leave that for powder and I'm gonna go
in with this because it does say that it
is a this is supposed to be a highlight
and contour sponge but I used it for
foundation so we'll see how this looks
blending it out okay I feel like it just
kind of blended and done nothing I mean
there's like a slight contour there but
nothing crazy
it's getting the job done that's for
sure I am going to use my just
foundation brush to blend out the
forehead I do feel like I'm looking
pretty heavy right now and I need to set
this with powder so that's my concern
for the foundation because it's
definitely a lot of the foundation is
what is making me look so shiny let's
set this face I'm gonna be using this
new powder from Rude cosmetics this is
in the shade banana so it just looks
like this and it says it's a Ultra High
Definition studio finish mineral powder
and open this bad boy up and set loose
folks because I'm looking then it does
come with this little puff which I don't
keep those yeah sorry plain this is what
it looks like like I said it looks
definitely more peachy okay so I'm gonna
take the morphe sponge I'm just gonna
set my face the way I normally do so
we're just gonna take it down here and
all over the skin and we are mattifying
everything up so so we are doing this
little smaller sponge okay I do feel
like it darkened up my face if you guys
can see I kind of lost that highlighted
effect just a little bit but not much
setting everything pretty well even
though it oxidized a little bit okay
we're just gonna so see you can kind of
see where it got darker Oh what happened
look it's like not moving blend blend
oh my god it's like stuck there why why
is it stuck there I'm not the biggest
fan of cuz it kind of just took away all
that work I needed for highlighting and
contouring and everything like you can
see how light my concealer was and now
how dark it is now we're gonna do is we
have a new morphe palette to try these
are the new contour palettes i'm
guessing i got the 8h i think it's a
little too dark for me but we'll try to
make it work the hi-fi sculpt and
shimmer a highlight contour palette and
this is what it looks like and then you
open it up okay there's not like a shade
this is basically just for contouring
and highlighting yeah this is a little
dark for me I probably should've gone
with a shade lighter but we're just
going to try this out anyways I'm gonna
take this color right here which is
called donut
and bronze a little bit of my face I
really don't need much because I'm
pretty dark right now it's actually a
good color for me it's like not too dark
not too warm and then I'm gonna take
this down my neck actually to try to
help us out here and then to contort
we're gonna take the shade right next to
it which is called debutant this one
right here hey I just need to get the
lighter shade underneath this blush I
did get the 8w or Master blush palette
when you see this you'll understand why
I got it this is what it looks like and
then it's just warm tones which I know
my look is more cool toned
this isn't unapologetic and we'll just
put this on our cheeks very pigmented
just FYI
that's super pretty I feel like my face
is a little bit heavy I think I put on
too much foundation bring some life back
to my face and I'm gonna take this
highlight shade called beam and I'm
going to highlight with that Wow I'm
like very lightly applied that so that
is really pretty
whoo I like that
definitely beaming that's for sure wow
that is nice you guys I love this
highlight like I'm about to have to take
this off and then refilm and do my get
ready with me for the military ball and
I think we're gonna use that highlighter
because that was so pretty and it's so
smooth Wow so wasn't used on associate
dip brow in soft brown but it's a little
too dark for me right now I can see why
it was like so weird I can see why it's
still in one of my new drawers because
it's just way too dark for me I looked
in my drugstore one because they don't
have any other high-end brow products to
try I have this Catrice cosmetics
eyebrow stylist in the Milani
brow pencil as well this Catrice one is
in the shade date with ashton and then
this one's in brunette so I'm going to
try to use this on the outer part and
this on the inner
so now I'm going to use the L'Oreal
infallible eyeliner this is in the shape
brown you don't really like coldtown
looks but I really like this eye shadow
look I think it looks really pretty
first shade I'm gonna take is this one
in the Maybelline palette I'm gonna push
this up against my lower lash line just
go ahead and M'Lynn that I'll use this
color or right here to blend all that
out I'm going to use a pencil brush to
do that
that is pretty much the eyes complete I
actually really love the way it turned
out like I said I don't really like cool
tones but I actually like the way this
turned out I think it looks really
pretty when you use this bite Beauty
zero one for lip liner I'm gonna fill in
my lips with this color just like a
perfect color for this look and then I'm
gonna put this Maybelline vivid lacquer
on top this one's in the shade unreal
ooh very pretty
yeah I think the foundation is not gonna
be the best for me but I think that's
the only thing I this video I really
didn't like oh as well as the Rouge
cosmetics powder not the biggest fan of
this just because how it changed the
color of my foundation and then also the
contour stick I would personally pass on
it that is it for this video thank you
guys so much for watching I hope you
enjoyed it I will see you guys in my
next video
did you ever know somebody left the city
I'm gonna tell my story another</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
