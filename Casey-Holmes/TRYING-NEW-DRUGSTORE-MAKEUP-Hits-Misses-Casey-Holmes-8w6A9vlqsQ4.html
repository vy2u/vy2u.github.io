get back from vacation I self tanned oh
my gosh I have not been this tan like
even naturally tan since I think I went
to Charleston over the summer and I had
a really deep tan then but uhm yeah I
self tan and I went to Lululemon
yesterday a lady was like oh my gosh you
just came back from vacation where'd you
go and I was like I know it's like
nothing to get that excited about but I
love a good self-tanner and I used it
for the first time finally since summer
has ended and I'm just I forgot how
obsessed with it I am and I just love it
so if you want to know what self-tanner
I use its loving tan I have a coupon
code for a free mint which you need I
definitely recommend I use the myth this
last time so I will leave it down below
in the description box if you're
interested today we are trying out some
new drugstore products if you guys saw
my last video it was a drugstore makeup
haul I believe that was the last video
we're going to see but I wanted to try
some of this stuff out on camera and
talk to you guys and just go through it
together
umm get the genuine first impressions of
everything so I'm gonna go ahead and
prime my eyes I am going to use my NARS
smudge proof eyeshadow primer since
we're talking about drugstore today let
me know in the comments what's like your
favorite drugstore product right now I
would love to know are you guys excited
for holiday stuff and I go to like
Walgreens CVS I don't see a lot of like
new a drugstore products out which is
kind of depressing cuz that's like the
main reason why I want to go to the
drugstore um so I don't know what
everybody's coming out with all their
fun new stuff but I'm hoping it's soon
I've also been going on Sephora and they
don't really have much either so I'm
just like what am I supposed to do
first I'm gonna trial is makeup a
revolution palette this is the 32
eyeshadow palette in the flawless - I
have tried the makeup revolution Mac's
palette it's like the eyeshadows are in
a straight line didn't really like it as
much because the colors just ended up
blending together and just just wasn't
it wasn't my favorite
is what the palette looks like doesn't
it look gorgeous and I just want to play
with it today so I'm gonna take the
matte cream or whoa y'all can't be
seeing my dirty table I'm gonna take
this matte white right here and put this
all over my lid to set it to set that
primer we just put on um but anyways
yeah let me know what your favorite
drugstore product is right now because I
love trying to find new things when I
went on Ulta and got all these Petrice
items I was super excited to get them in
the mail because I've never tried the
brand before so if there's like a brand
you haven't seen me use as well that
you're just in love with let me know in
the comments especially for eyeshadows I
mean like a drugstore not just
affordable I want to be able to go in
Ulta calm and different things like that
and just try some stuff out I'm gonna go
in this shade right here and I'm going
to take a fluffy blending brush and put
that into the crease also I had a lot of
people asked about Halloween tutorials
and I would love to do them but honestly
by the time I go online and order
everything it's gonna be Christmas
before it gets here so I'm always that
person who waits till the last minute
because I always forget about Halloween
tutorials until it's October first if
you will have a look that doesn't
require like a ton of face paint or like
special-effects stuff let me know
because I don't have any of that anymore
once I moved I just got rid of that
stuff cuz I was like okay so soon go old
I know if you guys have like a certain
look you want me to do just let me know
in the comments but I don't necessarily
plan on doing Halloween looks because I
need to remind myself like mid-september
to buy everything in like fake blood and
all that stuff so that when October
comes I'll have it now moving on I am
going to go ahead and take this really
nice warm brown I'm going to take a
smaller blending brush this is the Mac
two one seven oh I like that as super
warm it's my kind of color I put this
right below that transition shade but
still in the crease but I want to know
what you guys are doing for Halloween
that's another thing too I don't even
know what I want to be for Halloween I
got a like SWAT costume but
did not fit on me like I fit on that
model it just looked a hot mess on me
and I did not like it whatsoever so
that's not happening but hopefully I can
figure out what I want to be all else
fails I'll just dress in like all black
and do like one of those masquerade
masks you know where you can do a makeup
this is actually a really nice palette
and I'm looking at it are you all being
anything creative are you being
something sexy I was what was I last
year I was like a ninja warrior last
year or something and I had these two
swords on my back and by the in the
night swords are gone because I was over
it I was hitting people with him not
actually hitting them but like they were
all my back and every time I would go
through the crowd at the bar it was like
just hit people and I'm like oh sorry I
want anything with like something like
that again cuz I was just a pain in the
butt and like a waste of money
hey that eyeshadow is probably my
favorite that really warm brown that is
gorgeous I love that okay I want to kind
of do a lighter look like something with
shimmer because the last few looks I've
done have been really really really
dramatic I don't want to do something
Tudor attic this time now we're going to
take this like really pretty shimmery
shades right below the gold on my nails
are all by the way this one right here
and we're going to put this on the lid
it's not terrible but it's not like a
pop like I want it to be I'm going to
take the lighter shade right next to it
this is also like a shimmery white color
and put that on as well just to see if
this is any better
it's not bad I mean for a drugstore it's
just not super intense you know what I
mean it's just a light shimmer not my
favorite but it'll work I mean it could
be worse right it could be worse and I'm
just going to take that same warm brown
Oh scandalous oh what's that other
eyeshadow that I got so I'm actually
going to take this this is the Catrice
liquid metal eyeshadow
it's the Tina van der woodsen my
favorite my favorite so swatch this in
that video and it looked absolutely
stunning okay this is actually the
moment of truth you guys are you excited
it looks super pigmented see the
difference that that makes it's just so
much more pigmented vibrant shiny I wish
I didn't do one eye so you could really
see the difference but there's
definitely a difference between the two
and this is so much more creamy than the
shimmer
ones in the eyeshadow palette I'm
actually going to use one of these at
the highlight too today I'm going to
take a pencil brushes to my favorites
Mac and I'm going to use this has some
shimmer in it but I guarantee you once
you put on the lid you're not going to
be able to tell I'm putting this on the
very outer corner of the eye just to
deepen it up a little bit more so this
is just to add a little bit more
dimension deepen it up just doing a
v-shape with it
these blend out really well - I'm
actually really impressed with the matte
shades in here then I'm going to curl my
lashes and apply some mascara I'm going
to finish off my eyes real quick I'm
gonna put some falsies on and then I'll
be back and we'll try out some new face
products okay so now the lashes are on
now that I have everything on I'm going
to prime and we're going to try out a
new foundation I have to like I said I
haven't been this self tant in a long
time and when I ordered this I didn't
think I was going to be self-tan so
hopefully one of these will match I'm
really aiming to try this one first but
if the colors just way too often I'll go
for this one
okay so we have that on I am going to be
using my Real Techniques diamond sponge
you guys have not seen my video where I
tried this one and a couple other weird
sponges I will leave it down below and
like a card right here but supposedly
it's supposed to last up to 18 hours and
it's a matte foundation and it says it
mattifies it's long-lasting it's
oil-free I am gonna update you guys
later on in the night just to show you
guys how well everything is holding up
and if I like anything if I hate
anything well hate strong word if I
don't like anything I'll let you know
see how thick it is it's taking its time
running down there's like a mountain on
my hand so I am going to take like I
said this Real Techniques diamond sponge
start with a little bit okay it's pretty
light but we're gonna just have to
bronze surprisingly I like almost used
up those whole two pumps which I feel
like was a lot of foundation so far it
doesn't look matte it looks like a satin
kind of natural finish that is two pumps
completely on my face like it is all
gone but I did cover really well and I
like the shade the shade is a nice kind
of warm tone but it's not like orange
I'm pleasantly surprised at the coverage
uh I feel like I do do a little bit more
on my nose let's just see if it's a
buildable I don't really need any help
my cheeks but I'm just going to put some
on just to kind of cover that pimple I
have it blends really easily so that's
what it looks like it's not super dewy
but it's definitely got a little shine
to it it's not completely matte right
now so I am going to go ahead and just
do concealer okay so now I'm going to
take the Catrice liquid camouflage
concealer this says it's a liquid high
coverage ultra long lasting concealer
and it perfectly camouflaged under eye
circles spots and even tattoos I don't
have any tattoos but I would totally try
that out applying small dabs and let dry
well I apply extra layers if needed okay
if it's a high coverage you shouldn't
really have
apply extra layers unless we are
covering that tattoo so it's just a nice
little doe foot applicator see right
there I'm just gonna do what I normally
do holy hill this is like this has a
scent scent is that it has a scent to it
but it's like a good smelling scent I
don't know what it is it smells really
good so again I'm gonna take this and
just blend it out more of a medium
coverage in my opinion right now I might
see if I can maybe build up all my
cheeks but right now it is kind of more
of a medium coverage not super high I
think if you had really intense dark
circles it wouldn't cover it but it
looks really pretty on the skin I mean
it might not be the highest coverage
concealer but it looks really nice so
let's go ahead and even out the rest of
the face think I'm just gonna leave it
like that I don't really want to apply
more um that's enough for me I don't
have really intense dark circles or
anything like that so we're just gonna
highlight the face with the rest of this
so when I take my flower Beauty
translucent powder we're going to just
set everything so now to go ahead and
take my MUA brush and we're just going
to dust away all that baking I did and
I'm going to dust it on my face as well
just so we put our powder on nothing
gets stuck and everything is nice and
set we're going to try out this Catrice
Sun glow matte bronzing powder but this
is a shade deep bronze
I like this packaging it's really slim
and pretty you guys know I love my
Neutrogena Healthy Skin bronzer and
number thirty like look at this I'm
starting to tear this up but they're
going to try this one out okay I think
it looks like a nice I'm sorry I keep
looking in the viewfinder because I want
to see what looks like on camera but
it's a nice warm toned bronzer and I
really enjoy that so now what I'm going
to do is I'm going to contour it I'm
going to take another Catrice product as
you guys know I purchased so many things
from them in my haul so this is the
prime and fine professional contouring
palette this looks super promising I'm
like really excited to try it out so I'm
going to take the contour color I'm
going to use my Real Techniques brush
this is the setting brush I like to use
for contour and again with the packaging
I like it it's compact it's simple I
like the clear top I think Teresa is a
really good job with their packaging I
like that I don't remember the last time
I bronzed and contour with a high-end
product it's been so long I find such
good drugstore ones and I just get
hooked on them and I'm like I can't move
I can't leave I love it so again there
is a highlighter in here I'm going to
try this when we get to highlighter I'm
still probably gonna use something else
but I want to see what it looks like on
the skin I take this makeup a revolution
brush right brush I'm gonna take this
makeup revolution blush and make love
instead excuse me some serious mac
mineralize skinfinish vibes like it
looks really nice so I'm just gonna
you guys know I love blush so oh how it
gives it glow it's interesting I
normally like to keep these blushes
towards the back of the cheek not so
much coming up in here I will drag a
little bit of color just so it doesn't
look like it's all stuck in the back but
I try to keep it as far away from my
pores and texture as possible
when they're shimmery like this so
that's why I keep it on the back but it
has some really nice glow to it I don't
know if you guys can really tell but it
has a nice glow to it let's try the
Catrice one and this is just the other
side of the contour palette and I'm
going to take this morphe m-52 eight
brush it's a little too big but my
Anasazi ones in the other room so we're
just going to see how this looks on the
face that is not what I expected
I like it but it's too ashy for me yeah
that's that's too ashy for me it's
really yellow and I feel like once it
goes on my skin it looks really ashy so
I'm not I'm not I'm not gonna use that
but so what we are going to use is these
Catrice eyeshadows so I'm going to use
this champagne one real quick oh holy
shit oh my god alright okay first things
first very glittery you don't want
glitter highlights the angle itis
normally I don't if I had a smaller
brush I would like it a little bit more
but holy shit is it dense
oh my god it's so pretty though I'm
actually gonna take this metal eyeshadow
in the Cetina van der woodsen I'm gonna
highlight with this underneath my brow
god these eyeshadows are so worth it
these were like 2 or 3 bucks you guys
I'm gonna go snatch two more colors then
we're going to try out a lip color I
swatch these in my hull so i swash these
in my haul and they didn't look that
promising so I'm hoping they're good
they looked a pretty sheer but this is
the shade rosy Rose Royce rose voice
so the Catrice velvet matte lip cream I
like the smell I'm not liking this smell
at all didn't even realize is how like I
smell like that
see how sheer they are I don't take that
I don't like that that really sucks cuz
a lot three colors of those okay so look
color I'm gonna ply is this NYX matte
lipstick in the shade Mison mhm
this is fall so after you've got your
lips on that is the completed look I
think it's great for everyday and it's
great for going out kind of simple it's
pretty it's glowy and again you can
switch out this lip color and do a whole
bunch of different lip colors if you
wanted to you could do a red you could
do a burgundy a deep plum I mean you can
do so many different looks I am gonna do
one more update at the end of the day
before I take my makeup off to let you
know what I think about the face
products and the eyes and everything
like that if they faded and just what's
going on but yeah I would be back in a
few hours to give you guys a final
update on all of these products ok guys
so I'm going to finish this video off
differently I thought I was going to do
a final ending like conclusion when I
was filming this video but
instead here's a video of Casey
wakeboarding no this is vervain tail so
I wore it the whole day the foundation
is where I really been testing out I
don't really like the Catrice concealer
just because it is kind of sheer I just
I didn't really like it one of my
favorite but I'm wearing it the
foundation again today and I just don't
really like it I feel like it looks kind
of Foundation II as it should know but
like don't you think it looks a little
too texture it definitely feels like
it's on your face after a while and you
start getting oily so I would say pass
on this foundation it's not my favorite
I will go with the Maybelline better
skin over this one
I've been using my Smashbox Studios skin
foundation a lot which I love and it
looks like your skin so I don't know if
I'm just used to that but this just
looks too rough on my skin that is it
for this video I hope you guys enjoyed
it and I will see you all in my next one
