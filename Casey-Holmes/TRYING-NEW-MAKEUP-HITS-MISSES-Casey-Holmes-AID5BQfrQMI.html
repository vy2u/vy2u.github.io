my end I haven't filmed in like two and
a half three weeks I have not been at
this house in like a month it seems it's
been a long time I came back for like
two days but all in all I was pretty
much gone for a month and I'm back I'm
filming I'm with my makeup and I'm so
excited because there's a lot of
different things that I have to test out
for you so I'm really excited to try
some of these out and share them with
you I'm also gonna kind of chitchat with
you guys and give you a little updates I
think that is it so if you guys are
interested then let's just go ahead and
get started if you're wondering where
this sweater is from it's just like a
chunky cropped knit sweater it's from
Free People and I bought this like a
while ago what this before I think fall
even started so I'm going to quickly
apply primer I'm just using my regular
primer since we are trying some new
makeup out today I'll also be using my
same face primer because I have a new
foundation I want to try and we will
just see how well it works so what have
you guys been up to let me know what
kind of videos you want to see from me I
have been kind of drawing a blank
recently like trying to figure out what
to film I want to make us a four order
really soon and try out some new makeup
that is out and I haven't bought makeup
and so long I'm just like itching to buy
new stuff I want to do that very soon
and then I want to try the huda beauty
foundation but it is sold out don't know
when I'm gonna get that but it is sold
out and if it wasn't sold out
I would totally review for you guys I'm
gonna be honest I feel like I haven't
done makeup and so long that I feel like
I forgot how to do it okay so I'm
actually gonna be using the Too Faced I
want candy palette I have this palette I
have a whole box here full of and I also
have this Too Faced what is this cold
guessing this is the clover palette just
says clover on here and it talks about
his dog clover this is here too I don't
know which one we're gonna use I'm gonna
be honest I I look at this palette and I
just don't get excited about it I don't
know it's just it's not everything I
want to be but it does have some pretty
like fall colors in here like daddy
loves me cuddle buddy love is love retro
that is a really
we'll see what we can come up with with
this and then I have used to I want
candy palette like once and it is super
super pigmented so we'll see if we dip
into this this one does not have a
mirror but let me tell you these are the
most pigmented two-faced eyeshadows that
I have ever tried I'm gonna zoom you
guys in and we're just gonna kind of get
started I guess I will start with the
clover palette and we'll just see how
well these eyeshadows perform I will say
I'm not a fan of this packaging I just
feel like it looks a little too young
for me it's just it's not mine I don't
know it doesn't like speak to me or
anything but you know it's not about me
so we're just gonna keep it moving so
I'm going to take the shade Chihuahua
which is right here and I'm just gonna
set that eyeshadow primer hoping this
isn't too dark it just looks like a nice
medium okay that's a little dark okay
we'll just lightly set this and do a
really nice brow highlight so this is
kind of our transition shade as well
after Davis and I had our wedding
ceremony I had a lot of you asking me
like what makeup look I decided to do
and if you guys have watched the last
one it was the last bridal trial
tutorial that's what I did I just kind
of - out a few colors and I also forgot
like a lot of stuff I forgot so much
makeup for the wedding day I was like do
I did I even plan on doing my own makeup
like I don't know but yeah I went off of
that look so if you're interested you
can go check out that video and see the
look that I went for for the wedding
ceremony because I loved that look and
it was just such a classic makeup look
that I had to do it now I'm gonna go in
with fur baby right here I don't
understand this mint green I mean it's
pretty but I just I don't know what is
fur baby and I'm just going to throw
this into the RV and in the crease since
we had that Chihuahua shade pretty much
all over the lid literally have no idea
what I'm doing but we'll just will go
with it okay that's pretty let me know
what makeup products you guys are loving
lately that's new is there something you
want me to try out I feel like I've
definitely been on the back burner for
makeup like I haven't really been
looking at new things I have really been
keeping up either it's so hard to keep
up there's so much new stuff so if
there's something that you want me to
try
let me know and I will check it out but
so far actually this palette is not
looking bad at all it's really nice and
blended okay so I'm gonna go in with
puddle buddy right here and I'm just
gonna put this in the very outer V with
a sigma e25 this is more like a purple
taupe color I also got some of those new
YSL mat stains in an oh I cannot wait
I'm gonna be using one of them today
now I'm taking daddy loves me which is
this one right here and I'm going to
throw this kind of war on the center of
the lid into the crease that hey these
are pretty pigmented what else is there
oh my gosh so Davis and I bought
Riverdale last night on Amazon because
he's seen like a few of the episodes
which I was very mad about I was like
you're gonna watch River done without me
we bought it on Amazon last night and we
got a new sound bar yesterday and
everything sounds so good it sounds so
so so good and I'm so excited for
Riverdale and I know there's a new
episode coming up today but I have to
catch up on up on the other like the
last two episodes that probably everyone
is seen I'm really pumped about it
because I love Riverdale I tried
watching stranger things too like I
think we got into like the second
episode I just don't know how I feel I
don't know how I feel about it yet but
then again I also kind of feel like
that's how I felt about the first season
and then I like got hooked on it right
now
I love Riverdale like ribbon rolls with
my favorites and Betty is my girl
Veronica too style-wise Veronica and
then I would like hang with Betty I'd
probably hang with Ron I don't know I
love Betty and Veronica so much I'm
taking the shade wet kisses which is
this shade right here and I'm gonna
throw this into the inner corner that's
pigmented that's without any glare glue
nice I need to look up some info for
makeup looks because I'm not gonna lie I
have no inspiration lately I'm just kind
of winging it I'm gonna take a little
bit of a mac fix+ I haven't used this in
years
actually just got it not so long ago
to our package I personally love the
two-faced glitter glue but a lot of
people love mac fix+
so I'm gonna go back in with that so I'm
gonna take this wet brush and then take
that same wet kisses shade and just
touch it in here I did amp it up a
little bit
I love this color combo okay so now I'm
gonna take off this tape and then we're
gonna go in with a different eyeliner
and this is from the two-faced candy
Johnson line this is not sponsored by
Too Faced either they've just literally
been coming out with so much stuff this
is the I want candy liner in black
licorice and this does have a different
kind of tip on it it's like a felt tip
but it has a different shape as you can
see it's really really precise so I'm
just going to line my eyes per unusual
okay so I do think it gets like really
close to your lash line which is good
but for creating a wing and like
flicking it out really easily like
creating the line right above your
lashes is pretty easy - the fact that
I'm starting to get some jagged edges
the liner is nice it is a shiny liner so
if you like more matte liners you
probably won't like this I'm just not a
big fan of the applicator just because I
have to really I have to go clean this
up now because it's really really thick
give me a really dramatic wing so I'm
actually gonna go in with the makeup
forever ink eyeliner and I'm gonna go
over this because I do want a matte line
okay so what I'm gonna do real quick is
I'm gonna go ahead and clean this up and
I'm gonna apply mascara false lashes
false lashes I'm using is nothing too
different just gonna be using the Lily
lashes in Niko nose these ones right
here they're really really great then
I'll be back and we will start with our
face makeup so now we're gonna move on
to face I am gonna use my regular face
products
here is my Smashbox primer water my
Smashbox primer water was one of the
things I was missing the day of my
wedding
luckily my mother-in-law had it so I
like snacked hers for the day but I was
like I need that primer water in an
Austin mattifying primer this just fills
in my pores really nicely and kind of
does a little bit of color correcting as
well because it is tinted so I just
drink a little bit of this and put it in
my t-zone because it also helps mattify
smooth me out it's just a good product
and I can't stay away from it I'm a
little nervous for today's product
because I need full coverage and this is
not a full coverage product so we will
see how I like it but today I'm going to
be using this NARS Velvet stick matte
foundation I've been wanting to try this
for so long and finally I have the
opportunity to do it I'm going to be
using the shade Barcelona which is a
medium for I believe this will match me
pretty well at least my neck and body
but not my face and it does have a
sponge on the end which I can't
guarantee I'm going to use that but we
will try it out just to see what it's
like they say it's a medium coverage
product good for sensitive normal dry
combo oily it's a matte finish and it's
a one-of-a-kind versatile matte
foundation stick with built-in touch-up
blender for all-over coverage or
touch-ups on the go is the touch-up
blender to stipple or buff Foundation
and targeted areas so not necessarily
all over your face then it says sculpt
the face with lighter shades ba-ba-ba
way I take it is when it says use
touch-up liner to stipple or buff
foundation and targeted areas it's not
for your full face so let's just get
that there like if you have a little
area right here that you need to touch
up I take it you can just put foundation
here blend it out and be good when
you're on the go so it's not a bad idea
as long as they're not saying like use
this for all over your face we all would
we all would be here like what now don't
do one side of my face first this is
very creamy it reminds me of the
hourglass stick Foundation which I love
the hourglass stick foundation again
this is a medium coverage so we're gonna
see if we can build it up right now it
feels a little um not greasy but it
feels very wet in a way so I'm just
gonna take a brush
I'm on this out lens back to my ear
because what your needs it okay I need a
more dense brush that one's just not
gonna cut it for me Emily I don't need a
lot of product on my forehead but I do
feel like I'm gonna need just a tad more
to blend back towards the hairline
because we kind of ran out of product
but you can see right here this side
versus this side I mean it's still
covered quite a bit if you're not
looking for a full coverage finish this
might be for you let me see what it
looks like up close
then on the skin it doesn't look bad at
all it doesn't look cakey it just looks
really nice you guys know I love a full
coverage finish if I'm gonna wear our
foundations or anything I need it to be
full coverage I think this is great for
people who normally love medium coverage
but you do want that option to build it
up to full coverage because this is that
product and I think when you press it in
it's just gonna be a lot better than
buffing it into the skin because you're
gonna get more coverage out of it I
wouldn't say this is a matte finish at
all I think to me it's just it's not
does feel a little heavy not gonna lie
it but I did apply quite a bit of
product okay so for concealer I think I
want to use my regular concealer just to
see how this foundation really wears
with my regular products even though I
know it's a full face of first
impressions I'm really gonna see how it
wears like I want to see how it wears in
my t-zone and stuff because so far I'm
really liking it I'm gonna use Tarte
shape tape light medium I'm gonna use
Maybelline fit me in liked zero one
gonna take the laura mercier secret
brightening powder for under eyes I have
not tried this before and I've always
wanted to and I was lucky enough to get
it in our package so I'm just super
excited to try this out I can't remember
if people love this but I just I don't
know when I got this I remember people
back in the day being like oh my god
it's amazing you got to try it so here
we are years later I feel like it's
really light and when create a white
cast let me know if you guys have used
it that's how you feel I also have this
luxe Pro powder in banana by j-cap
beauty's like just banana powder to set
your under-eye with
whoa talk about super smooth though
using a really light amount as well I
think what I'm gonna do is just set the
rest of my face with this Lux Pro powder
and banana from jcat beauty and just set
the rest of my face that looks really
pretty too I feel like it does have
quite a bit of a tint but setting
everything really well so far those two
products are really nice I don't see any
cakiness or anything like that I think
everything looks pretty smooth or as
smooth as it's gonna get with my texture
only thing I will say is this foundation
really is breaking up right here in the
center of my brows I think I will say is
it starting to get really cakey here
between my brows but everything else
looks pretty decent so now we're gonna
move on to bronzer I'm going to be using
this Victoria Beckham bronzer and Estee
Lauder this one's in 0-2 looks really
pretty and then I'm gonna take my
regular bronzer brush which is by Soho
it's a drugstore brush I'm just going to
bronze my skin whoa
that's a pretty color so I'm also gonna
do is I'm even gonna contour with this
too just a little bit I'm gonna take a
smaller brush and just hit this right
underneath that cheekbone I like that
this could double as like a bronzer in a
contour cuz that looks really really
pretty I like this this is a an
a-plus-plus I like that a lot for blush
I'm gonna be using this Jane Cosmetics
berry bouquet love anything to it
florals oh I love this packaging so has
like little roses white roses on the
side oh I love this packaging I know it
was a twist-off that's okay so that's
really pretty packaging I like that a
lot okay so I'm just going to dip into
mainly the lighter side over here and
just graze my cheeks
I have two highlighters that I want to
try today we have this new Tarte one
this is the goddess glow highlighter
this one looks like it has chunks of
glitter in it so it could go terribly
wrong but it does look super pretty in
the pan and then we also have this Becca
gradient glow and this looks really
really pretty
and it's just like a lot of bronzy tones
and again it has like a lot of shimmer
into it so we're just gonna try both of
them the first one we're gonna try is
the Tarte one and I think I'm gonna try
it on this side my face since I have so
much texture on the other side and this
has like chunks of glitter
not as intense as I thought it would be
to be honest it's okay
it just has too much shimmer in it like
too much glittery particles and what I'm
seeing like the glow underneath is
really pretty but I'm also seeing like
specks of glitter kind of everywhere and
glitter is not good for my skin because
I have so much texture I can't be I
can't be playing with glitter but I want
to try it out just to see how it looks
and it is nice but not my favorite on
the other side I'm gonna use this Becca
highlighter which looks really pretty
yeah I think that one's my favorite that
one is intense for my brows I'm going to
be using this Milani stay-put brow color
in the shade natural taupe I don't think
I've tried this before but it looks like
a really good shade I'm not gonna use
the brush in it I'm gonna use my own
brush for it Amity is this pomade it
looks like a really good color so that's
it right there alright so let's do these
brows I'm surprised I even have any
brows because I've been picking them so
much lately cuz that's what I do when
I'm stressed I pick my brows a little
bit of product goes a long way
like I have anyone dip back into the pot
yet it's already pretty much getting
like my whole brow that's crazy that's
like my favorite tail end of a brow that
I've ever had alright so there is the
brows done I really like them I like
this brow pomade from Milani I could
definitely see myself using this every
single day it's really easy very
lightweight it's not like a waxy finish
or anything it literally just fills in
your brows so I like this a lot
and then I'm going to set my brows and
I'm going to use just my regular Too
Faced one cuz I don't have a new brow
gel this is just the brow kwikki from
Too Faced going back into this Too Faced
palette I'm going in with cuddle buddy
which is the darker shade we used on the
outer V and I'm just gonna put this up
against that lower lash line taking a
pencil brush i'm going in with daddy
loves me
I actually really like this I shadow
palette I just want to say that now I
think the color is blended really well
and I feel like they look really good
the one thing I will say is before I
came back on camera like when I was
applying my lashes the shade wet kisses
right here that I used on the inner part
of my eye was it did have a lot of
fallout like I was cleaning up and I was
like whoa that's a lot so just be warned
if you do your foundation first does
have some fallout but it's pretty on the
eyes we're moving on to lips and we've
got these white cell matte lip stains I
feel like this one would be so pretty am
I crazy or should I go lighter and I'm
gonna go with this one first because it
has like that same tone as the eye
shadow matte stain and number five which
looks so pretty I'm gonna put this on my
lips oh that color so this is a matte
stain which I have not used from Y so
before I don't use any of their stains
it's definitely not as intense as I
thought it would be I thought it would
be more like the color on like in the
bottle but I do think it's pretty it's
just not what I wanted for this look
it's looking a little bit it's not
looking as deep as I wanted so anyways I
mean that's a pretty color I think it's
nice
but I just want something different so
I'm actually gonna go in with this Urban
Decay vice lipstick and rapture but this
is the makeup look for all of the first
impressions that I used today I
definitely think the one thing that I
was kind of taken back by is definitely
the foundation it's just not looking
good on my nose and between my brows I
feel like you can see it it's just it's
just not it's not sitting well on my
skin I think if the base makeup was a
little bit better I would like the full
look a little bit more I still really
love the eyes actually love the combo of
that wise sell lip color in the urban
decay shade I think it looks really
pretty with the shadow just not
impressed with the foundation I feel
like I'm such a big base person I need a
good foundation and a good base for
everything to sit on anyways let me know
what you guys think of these products
down below and what you think worked
what didn't and are you gonna try it
these products I want to know and thank
you so much for watching I will see you
guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
