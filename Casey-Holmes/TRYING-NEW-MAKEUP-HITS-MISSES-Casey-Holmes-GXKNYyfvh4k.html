trying out a bunch of new makeup this
isn't quite a full safe because I'll
have a full face of stuff and I kind of
want to use my regular primers with some
of these items because I want to make
sure I give you a nice first impression
review about we have things like these
subculture palette we have the new milk
makeup blur liquid foundation we've got
some stuff monstrovia again makeup
forever so we just have a bunch of
things to go through today I hope you're
excited because I know I so don't forget
to subscribe before you leave and if you
want to see me try out a bunch of
different makeup products then let's
just go ahead and get start first things
I want to try these I want to put all my
shoulders right now which is why I
bought these I don't normally use liquid
highlighters for my face just because I
prefer a powder highlight but these
anasazi a Beverly Hill liquid glow
highlighters came out and they just look
like they're going to be gorgeous on the
skin I love using liquid highlighters on
my body you know I love this do you
product from Marc Jacobs it's just a
liquid highlighter has a really gorgeous
golden glow I love this product but when
I saw these I know it had to have them
so I got to shave the shape the peseta
shades Perla and Bron we're just going
to open them up now these are really
nice and travel friendly too like these
little squeezy bottles I like that a lot
they're not glass like a Marc Jacobs one
it could possibly break no shade on the
Marc Jacobs on that because I love that
she's in mixed together you could
probably be pretty so this one's Perla
and this was bronzed how gorgeous are
those no I'm just going to mix both of
them and put them on my shoulder it is
so pretty oh like it doesn't look like
makeup sometimes it can look like makeup
you know and look a little off so I get
those the two thumbs up I don't know how
they would work for your face but I mean
for your body they really do give you a
gorgeous luminous glow and it doesn't
look like a lot of highlighter and you
put it on your shoulders you don't think
okay so I got you guys really is zoomed
in because we're going to be going in
with you subculture palette there's been
a lot of mixed reviews on this product
so I don't know take some tape but I
heard there was hella fallout so I would
do your face makeup last because that
will help you out so
much I hate cleaning up fallout but I
always do my eyes first and then I love
having a nice fresh space you know what
I mean ok so again this is the
subculture palette I was so excited to
purchase this right when it came out I
knew I had to have it when I saw the
pictures first I was like oh my god it
is gorgeous and it definitely has a same
kind of texture packaging that the
Renaissance palette has get a brush
again and they're your shades they are
so beautiful I was just so excited when
I saw this palette so the first thing
I'm going to use is the shade dawn right
here and I'm going to throw this all
over my lid I fit into it three times
it's pretty powdery oh it's probably not
the best shade to go all over the lid
with what we're going to do it a little
darker than I expected so I will say I'm
not the hardest critic when it comes to
fallout I'm going to be a hundred
thousands of you because a lot of my
favorite eye shadows have a lot of
Fallout I've heard this is like a godly
amount of Fallout so we will see I'm
going to be taking the shade Roxy right
here which is like a gorgeous kind of
peachy color and I'm going to throw this
into my crease and I'm going to just
throw this in here
I'm just going to try to blend it oh
well I'm slowly like trying to take it
up towards the brow to blend that line
and besides looking a little bit better
than the other side I'm going to take a
little bit more of dawn like you just
need to barely tap your brush into this
barely to have your brush in there it's
a little bit dawn trying to blend out
this line that's those two first shades
are looking like rocks is going on a
little bit patchy is a very very pretty
color I think just building it up when
you what do you guys think by the way I
bought this myself I'm not sponsored at
all I'm going to go on with the show
destiny because this green is calling my
name
I'm using it destiny right here and I'm
going to throw this into my crease I'm
very lightly touching my eye
now I'm going to go in I'm going to
blend down that line in just a second
but I'm going to go in with the shade
all-star right here holy I will say
I don't have a ton of fallout like all
my face at all do you guys see ball out
there's like none there I'm using a Mac
239 right now to pack this onto the lid
some y'all gonna kill me but another
structure just open these edges Belinda
Roxy I feel like have some of the most
fallout that I'm going to take it and
blend out the edges
hopefully it's definitely getting patchy
right in here I may need this makeup
looked a little real good tonight James
and I are going out his birthday let me
go back in with all-stars and just try
to touch up that lid since it is a
little bit patchy just those edges like
Destiny's kind of been lost you have to
really blend it out to make it work and
now it's just starting to look like kind
of like one color all right let's go
almost like one of the lightest shades
in here I think I'm going to take I
can't tell if I want to take edge or
NuWave but I want to take one of these
yellow tones right here I think when you
go in with edge first which is the kind
of lighter one right here again with a
Mac 239
it's a little different for you today
will be the color actually just keep
looking at myself as I look she's too
much for me right now
okay I'm going to take a face powder
which I'm going to be using in this
Estee Lauder perfecting loose powder
this is newer as well I believe I'm not
sure but it's new to me and it's in the
shade translucent I'm going to be using
this to set my face today I'm also going
to use it to set my I'm going to be
taking the shade dawn first this is a
little bit darker okay now we're going
to go back in with Roxy and I'm just
going to put that on top of John just a
little bit lower I just have so much to
do tonight and I could not have that
smokey eye
where it was like I was punched in the
eyeball going to take the shade new ways
throw that in a little bit lower damn
these like yellow shades are so pretty
so I'm going to need to come all over
the lid I'm going to use electric just
because speaking to me and put that on
the lid I thought I was putting on the
lid
gonna be on the river stay honest with
you I'm like swirling my brush really
hard to get into the shade but you
really got to work for that color and
build it up it's like the first layer of
me digging my brush into the shade okay
so I'm just going to stop there so we
can move on to foundation so that's what
we have working for us right now the
things that yellow shades are really
really beautiful oh man it just kind of
bummed that the Sophie I didn't turn out
as well as I wanted so we're just going
to go ahead and move on to this milk
makeup blur liquid matte foundation has
85 reviews on Sephora and it has almost
5 stars like it's real close it is so
close to heaven 5 stars you see that
crazy I dig it two shades they have 16
shades in the line for this milk makeup
blur liquid matte foundation that's
what's called you get one ounce it is
$40 shades I got our medium and medium
tan I figured I could either mix the two
use one it's looking like I might be
medium if I need a little bit more I can
fill with maybe I'll throw in a little
medium pan since it has full coverage
it's good for sensitive normal oily
combination skin so if you're dry
probably stay away from this so that
it's an ultra weightless the full
coverage Foundation was an oil free
silicone free formula that lets the skin
breathe designed to make applying and
wearing foundation easy
it offers flawless full coverage at
first swipe leaving a smooth matte
finish that looks infield as light as
air also unit no melt makeup is vegan
oil-free gluten free silicone free and
cruelty free so I'm going to use a brush
to apply today again I am going to mix
the shade medium tan and medium to kind
of match my self tanner that I have I'm
going to use more medium though this is
this little squeeze you tube I like that
a lot so it's pretty runny as you can
see medium medium tan also if you're
wondering that highlighters like a dried
down I just ran my finger over and none
of it's coming off on my finger okay I'm
gonna be using my pure cosmetics brush
making sure I really blend this out
since it is so full coverage I want to
make sure we are completely blended
there's nothing sitting on the skin
those two mixed together match my self
tan really well now nothing's going to
make sense but you know when a
foundation is kind of heavy it kind of
has some pull to it like you could feel
it holding on to your bristles and
you've really got to move it around that
is this product has like a natural do to
it not too matte I actually don't mind
that I think you really do have to blend
it out though I think it is easy to
blend but you really got to work with it
and just make sure you get any excess
product off your skin I feel like I'm
like the hardest critic on milk makeup
but I don't try to be it's just a lot of
their things don't work out for me I
don't feel like it's super lightweight I
definitely feel it on my skin it is kind
of going down to a like matte finish
other than around my t-zone it is still
feeling a little bit wet so I'm just
correcting to try to get you know any
excess product and all of that see how
it's kind of like making my skin look
older right here you see my chin right
here pores they don't really look super
blurred or anything well it doesn't look
like anything crazy but right like right
here is just looking really like aged
we're just going to move on to concealer
I'm going to be using these Yvonne she
tips tour embellishing concealer this is
any shade number two so this is the
packaging this is different concealer
and I've happened for a while as a mean
easy fit but it's a crayon concealer has
a little pink side I don't really know
why and then the concealer so I'm
guessing the pink is just to brighten or
skis on why for now
try this Tarte one is this kind of dense
but let's see this works okay with this
concealer brush and Loomis though I feel
like concealers like this really need to
be blended out with a brush because they
tend to drag if you used with a sponge
oh my nut concealer it really brightened
up the eye it's not like super light or
anything saying it does look a little
dry underneath the under eyes see how
much brighter that looks and it doesn't
really look like you're wearing
concealer just looks like compartments
on the darkness underneath the eyes okay
and now we're going to set the face
again with that Estee Lauder translucent
perfecting loose powder
I'm not going to bake because I feel
like it will really make this foundation
look cakey and dry so I'm just going to
set it when you use this Too Faced
mr.right brush and I'm just going to
just this all over my face and like
press it in and then underneath my eyes
I'm going to take that same Tarte brush
and just set it as well with the powder
is all done
still I mean the foundation still looks
iffy but we're just gonna keep it movin
today next I'm going to use the Laura
Mercier matte radiant baked powder since
they are bronze oh three svj i use this
before I've used her bronzers before and
loved it this is so pretty I actually
got a full PR set of like her
highlighters and stuff but they all
broke those the only thing that likes to
buy just gonna bronze my skin with it
this is a SOHO brush where you get two
whole products I got to turn the PXA
ting and like Walmart and Target I love
this brush it's just like a nice fluffy
this color is perfection look at that
pretty I like it I do like it again I'm
pretty sure I've used her bronzer before
and I was really a big fan not too
surprised there I'm going to go in with
some new makeup forever products as you
guys know they came out with a bunch of
like single you know sculpting powders
highlighters and blushes so that you can
create your own palettes they have like
these little pellets that are for sale
they have individual palettes for sale I
do get the PR set and I created this
blush palette like we are you guys
surprised that this is my blush palette
I mean but these are the shades that I
chose to put together and then
one I do have a sculpting powder in here
which is what I'm going to try out today
to contour I'm going to go in with this
Real Techniques brush so they've been
contouring with and just contour my
cheeks we've also been loving the pur
cosmetics contour book so pretty nice
you can barely see it I mean like you
can see the definition but you can't
really see the powder the nice subtle
shade I think I think is the more dense
brush I could really chisel out my
cheeks another thing that I've been
doing I've actually been doing a cream
contour when I do a really like full
coverage look so I think I'm going to
show you guys that foundation routine
and like contour routine very soon once
I like perfect it but I've been really
enjoying that as well but I'm going to
take the same brush I bronze with I'm
just going to mix these two shades right
here and tight to my cheeks I need
another one of these brushes okay so I
don't have a highlighter my travel
makeup bag right here I've been
traveling quite a bit I haven't really
unpacked it so I'm just going to take my
highlighter in here which is my Smashbox
palette in Perl ooh
dropped it family's on Sofia brush now I
do have a brow product to try out
actually up to I have one from Lottie
London which is the arch rival brow
artist this is just a pencil brow
product which I will be honest I don't
normally use pimple brow product so I
figured I would try it for this video
and as well as this are Dale how much
that tells us our dough strike a brow a
fettering pen that I just got in the
mail so it literally is just a nice
pigmented I mean I'm only don't feather
in my brows I'll be honest like I'm
doing light strokes this is the part
where I have a hard time so look at that
brow
taking super light strokes by the way
okay I need a fleece I need to work on
my feather technique obviously so I'm
going to go into with the Lottie London
in a pencil
there's no pomade in my brow it just
feels like brow does that make any sense
like I've been using the pretty
whimsical pretty vulgar cosmetics brow
pomade which I normally use a brow
pomade but this has like a waxy texture
to it and it does feel kind of heavy on
the brows this is just like your natural
brow filled in a little bit I'm not done
here I'm just talking about it well kind
of nice are like in order to be a
hundred cent honest with you I thought I
was going to go into this and absolutely
hate it which I do need a lighter color
a hundred and ten percent
but I don't mind it feel like that was
just like so easy to do now I'm going to
move on to mascara I have this essence
volume stylist eight eyelash extensions
mascara so it says it has lengthening
fibers it's a mascara for perfectly
styled lashes with lengthening fibers
for fuller and longer lashes up to 18
hour hold ooh interesting I kind of
thought this would have like five actual
fibers in it and I expected a different
wand not to touch up my eyeshadow but I
am so impressed by that with without and
one thing I'm noticing is it's really
building up volume at the base and then
wisping out the top lashes while still
adding volume to them I mean you do have
to go into the tube a couple times but
honestly for thick for the end result it
really is worth it and like literally
takes each individual lash and like
coats them with product I love it that
was awesome I'm so happy I'm okay I'm
going to go back into the subculture
palette and I'm going to take a select
brush like this one Oh an all-star
and then I'm going to take a pencil
brush I'm going to go in with a mix of
New Wave and Roxy now for lips I have a
couple different things I have this elf
liquid matte lipstick and then I also
have this Too Faced melted latex which
is like a high shine lip product so GERD
I would put this down first and then put
this on top that kind of when you use
both so this elf liquid lip is in the
shade of praline don't think I've tried
any there little bit but that's what the
applicator looks like I love those kind
of active traders because they hold
product so well oh no honey is so chunky
do you see that they hold a lot of
product but down come on
transfer okay
and it feels comfortable on the lip I
like that a lot
so again I'm going to take this Too
Faced melted that latex a liquid high
shine lip in the shade hopeless romantic
okay guys so that is the completed look
of everything that I've tried today is
the same that I'm on the fence about are
definitely the subculture palette little
disappointed it just didn't turn out the
way I hoped it would I do love the
colors in the color range it's just one
of the colors that I really loved divine
which is this green shade right here
just ended up a little bit darker than I
expected all my eyes and it didn't want
to blend out that well I was a little
disappointed with a left trick because I
really had to work to get that on my lid
I feel like the eyeshadows just look
choppy I love the modern sometimes but
there's something about this that I
can't make it look that great on my eyes
for some reason on the Friends of eye
I'm not 100% in love with it like I
thought I would be I was very excited to
get this in the mail and it was just
kind of like I don't know it's not my
favorite okay and then for the milk
makeup foundation I think it's nice I do
think it looks a little heavy on the
skin I'm going to wear it throughout the
day and see how I feel about it I did
like it looks a little heavy in some
areas but it is very very full coverage
but again this is the product that I'm
like not I've ever sent in love with
it's just okay for me to use and the
last thing is edgy bunchy concealer I do
like it but it decreased quite a bit so
I'm a little nervous to wear this
throughout the day because I do not want
to crease on me but it did bright and
really well I really liked it a lot
everything else I love I really love the
brow products I want to get a little bit
better with them I'm not you I don't
usually use a stick or a pin to fill in
my brows so I definitely want to try
them a little bit more to kind of affect
it but I do think it's really quick and
it's convenient especially the brow pin
like the Ardell sculpt brow like I think
it was awesome and so easy to use I just
in the lighter shade let me know you
guys thought of the products that are
used in the comments below I definitely
want to hear your thoughts everything
else I really love especially this
liquid lip even though it's chunky for
some reason so yeah thank you guys so
much for watching I hope you enjoyed
this video and I will see you all in my
next one bye
