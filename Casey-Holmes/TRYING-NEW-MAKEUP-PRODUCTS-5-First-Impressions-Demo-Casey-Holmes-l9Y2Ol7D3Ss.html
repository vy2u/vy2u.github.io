first impressions video I have one two
three four five products to share with
you guys for them are like complete
first impressions and then one of them
I've tried the formula but this is going
to be a different color so I love these
kinds of videos and you guys seem to
really like them as well and I'm really
happy that you do because I really enjoy
them so the first thing I'm gonna do is
I'm actually gonna try two green primers
today I'm gonna try one on one side my
face and one on the other and the ones
that I have are the Marc Jacobs cover
stick and this is just the color
corrector and then I have the urban
decay and Naked Skin one and again this
is the green corrector so I'm gonna try
one on one side one on the other okay so
this Marc Jacobs one it says that it has
a soft focus it's custom correction and
foolproof perfection so I hope it's
foolproof
this is what the packaging looks like
it's really cute sleek and I like the
packaging I like that it's a stick
format you can just twist it up so real
quick let's see it's really creamy so
all these shades are going to kind of
mix together and it's like acetone they
said like a citroën and lime corrector
I'm just going to take this and I'm
going to use this one on my right side
I'm just going to kind of do this this
one's different than any other corrector
that I have personally seen mainly
because it's not just a plain green
primer this does have that other peachy
kind of shade in it which is really
interesting to me and then I'm going to
just take I guess I guess I'll just take
a Beauty Blender and just blend that in
and this is really creamy and it's not
making me look completely dead
so I'm just kind of dabbing it in I mean
I don't really know how they're how else
I should apply this maybe with a brush
but it did neutralize the skin really
nicely I mean there's still quite a bit
of rosacea showing right here but you
can just see the difference between this
side and this side it definitely did
neutralize so I'm going to see if you
can actually build it up real quick now
of course you would want to put like a
foundation and stuff on top but I just
want to see if you can build it so let's
see if we can use a brush this time I'm
going to take a brush this time is if we
can just dab it in it's so easy to blend
in you guys and there you have it
Wow guys I really like that and this
feels so good like I feel like when you
put your foundation on top it should be
fine that neutralized so much of my
redness now for the other side we're
going to take this Urban Decay 1 and I
love the Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer so I was super pumped when I
saw that they came out with this but if
you don't have redness they also have
the other colors of course for the
correctors like the lavender and the
orange e peachy colors they have a bunch
of different shades so if you don't have
redness problem these products will
still probably work for you it's kind of
cool that you can see one in action but
kind of know the formula and know if the
formula might work for your skin or not
now I'm going to take this bad boy I
love this applicator and I'm just gonna
put this on the rest of my redness now
you can see how different this one is
compared to the other one I'm probably
applying too much but we're gonna put
foundation over top this one looks so
natural to me and I really like that
they're going to take just this Real
Techniques brush and just blend this in
but you can see this one leaves more of
a minty feel behind but this also blends
in really well as well I kind of didn't
expect anything less
and I'm just applying this to see how
well it covers if it's buildable you
know different things like that but some
people have more redness than I do so
it's good to see if people want to apply
more can you apply more and then can you
put your foundation on top of it you
know so that's why I'm applying so much
but if it was just me I would apply what
I have now and then put foundation on
top because usually the foundations will
cover everything I feel like I kind of
like the Beautyblender so far better
with the Urban Decay one I don't know I
feel like it blends a little better it
kind of soaks up any excess product Wow
guys look redness is gone it's so crazy
okay so so far so good I'm looking at my
skin I feel like I'm starting to feel
like the Marc Jacobs one is in my pores
let me show you guys real quick you see
right here that this one's like clinging
in and going in my pores whereas this
one is not which is huge for me because
I don't want it going in my pores so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
apply a foundation on top I'm actually
going to try a new one today this is the
Tarte empowered hybrid gel foundation
and the shade medium honey this shade
might be a little too dark for me okay
this one says that it has full coverage
skin loving ingredients wrapped in a
luxurious creamy gel it's an oil-free
blend of smoothing plumping and pore
finding ingredients to help brighten
this game while moisturizing and
blurring look of fine lines and pores
it's cooling hypoallergenic gel feels
like a drink of water for your skin
while masking any redness oops
will try to give a redness I just want
to dry these primers but it says that it
will cover redness and acne uneven skin
tone for 12 hours for all skin types
it's available in a range of shades to
match any skin tone with a soft rose
scent and natural radiant finish so I
will try this again with my rosacea
going through it's also good to see how
it would react on top of something like
on top of these correctors can hold up
will it get cakey and things like that
it kind of has a scent but to me I feel
like it smells like foundation I don't
think it has like a rosy scent so I'm
gonna do one side with a brush and one
side with a Beauty Blender I guess I'll
try the Beauty Blender first the only
thing I don't like about these is that
they're really messy and there's just no
pump so it just kind of sucks that you
have to like take a spatula take some
stuff out or use your finger I don't
know however you prefer but I'm just
going to take a q-tip and apply this all
my skin
this is pretty full coverage I think I
applied too much when this do the nose
like this this is a very nice warm color
I was afraid it's gonna be too warm but
it's not bad this is so full coverage I
feel like I applied way too much so
definitely don't apply a lot of first
have faith that it's gonna cover with a
little bit I feel like that's a pretty
dang good match I mean the bronze my
neck just a little bit but it's a pretty
good match so so far over the naked skin
though it looks really good it doesn't
look you know cakey or anything like
that it really handled all of that
product well so and now I'm going to
apply it to the other side and use it
with my artist brush our teeth whatever
it's called I did a review on this brush
too if you want to check it out
I will leave that link down below
I feel like it's not covering as well
with this brush in my opinion then again
it might be because I apply less product
starting to see some redness coming
through on my nose
don't take just a tad more and see if I
can build it up with this brush okay so
I feel like this is buildable I feel
like the brush really does help not make
it look cakey or too piled on but there
is redness peeking through right here I
can't really tell which way I like it
better I think it looks good both ways
I like the beauty blender and I like the
brush so that's good that you can kind
of pick and choose whatever one you want
I just like putting this brush on my
face feels so good little bit goes a
long way with it it does look really
pretty I like it both ways with the
Beauty Blender and a brush I'm really
liking it with this artist brush though
because it just glides on in the way it
feels is just perfection so whatever way
you want to apply it I think will work
for you now if you have a lot of redness
or something I would probably try a
beauty blender that way it kind of
covers everything with one go around
instead of building it up so that's just
my opinion and what I would do oh my god
this is so messy yes foundation is so
messy I'm getting it everywhere
and it does feel really good on the skin
like it doesn't feel super heavy or
anything like that it does have that
cooling sensation but we're gonna see
how it handles some concealer and I'm
going to use this array space so this is
going to conceal and brighten with one
step and I'm thinking you just use this
as like the first thing you use before
your concealer I remember people used to
use this all the time back in the day
but I don't remember how they used it
but it's a pretty dark salmon-colored
product so it's going to cancel out any
darkness I don't have too much darkness
I do in the corners of my eyes but not
too much like down here
somedays I will but like right now I
don't
wow this is really thick so I'm just
going to take a little bit and put that
in here I just want to see the sole
look more brightened up so I'm going to
do it on one eye and then leave the
other eye kind of bare it's really
creamy and I like the color of it so I
mean it looks pretty dang bright nobody
do you guys think
now like I said I don't know if you use
this by itself I'm guessing you could
because that doesn't look bad but I am
going to put a concealer on top to see
if we can build it up we're just
building up products today my face is a
canvas diana is a concealer I know in
love you can see the difference right
there how much more bright this is so
I'm just going to apply a little bit not
a lot probably lunch some people with a
lot of me then this I I'm just gonna do
my regular concealer routine I gotta get
a new one
I ran onto my other naked skin and I saw
this one and I was like well I guess I'm
you think that one cuz I'm no George
and now I'm just going to blend it out
that's like so bright it looks really
good though and it feels really good
underneath my eyes I mean I have a lot
of product on my face to have the
correctors I have the foundation I have
this array space and now concealer I
have a lot of product on but everything
is blending so well like this I mean I'm
really shot though this foundation looks
so good with how much product I have on
my face Randall and it's kind of like a
semi matte finish the foundation it's
not like a flat matte I feel like I have
a really prominent indention right here
I don't know if that's just me looking
at myself okay so looking at myself
right now this inner corner I'm looking
in the viewfinder to kind of show you
guys this inner corner definitely looks
more bright and awake but I feel like it
looks like I have an intense shadow
right here even though I applied the
erase paste there so it's kind of giving
me like the illusion that I'm a little
tired while this eye looks pretty good
in my opinion like just doing the
regular concealer routine so I'm
guessing if you have really really
really dark circles I think you would
really like this because it does
brighten a lot but I'd have to try it
out more because I feel like I see more
of an indention here and I'm not sure
why okay so now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to go finish up the rest of my
face and then the last thing I want to
show you guys is this blush so I will be
right back after I finish the rest of my
face makeup okay so I have the rest of
my face makeup on I'm going to go ahead
and apply this blush it's from lorac and
it's the colorsource buildable blush
basically they say they can be worn
sheer for a natural flush of color or
layered for a dramatic effect I will say
I did try the so actually I tried this
blush yesterday this is the prism one
and the packaging but I was thinking
okay if it's a buildable blush it's
gonna be sheer and I can go ahead and
apply like quite a bit on my brush and
just apply to my cheeks
this looks pigmented I had to blend it
out luckily it does blend really well
but I was like oh okay it's not as sheer
as you probably think it is if you use a
light amount on your brush it will be
sheer but they have some color payoff
this one's in the color cinematic I just
love this packaging it's so sleek
okay and I'm gonna take a blush brush
it's such a beautiful color this is one
of the colors I'm so excited to try they
did send this to me and the first one
that I was like I need to put that on my
face with this one even though I put the
other one on first but I really love
this color and I'm just going to you see
how intense that is I really don't have
that much on my brush like they are
pretty intense but they do blend out
really well so a little does go a long
way with this because they're so
pigmented
you can see that they just kind of blend
out really nicely and it just gives you
that nice flush of color just little
rosy cheeks that we've tried to cover up
in the beginning of this video okay so
I'm officially done with my makeup and
trying out all these different products
and I want to say a little review on
every little thing and my last one I did
include like many reviews in the
description box and it will have an
updated video on all of these products
that I've done in these past couple
videos in one video
and I'm gonna let you guys know an
update if I like them is something that
returned whatever I've tried on camera I
will do an update video in a couple
weeks after I've tried everything for a
good amount of time and I will let you
know how good it is if it withstands
heat because I'm going to be trying some
stuff out when I'm out in the Sun so I
will have an update video for you guys
but I want to do a really quick mini
review so far just like my first
impressions and what I'm thinking and
then at the end of the day I'll have
some notes in my phone and for a
complete full-day review I will have it
in the description box as well just so
you're not going too long without
wondering it should I buy it does she
like it was a horrible throughout the
day like I will put it in the
description box for you guys let's start
off with the first things which are
these correctors again we have the Marc
Jacobs one that has that little swirl in
there and then we also have the urban
decay one I really like both of them but
I do think I like the urban decay one a
little bit better it didn't sink into my
pores as bad this one did kind of sink
into my pores but it did counteract a
lot of that redness these both look
great underneath foundation and they
both really
cover up and neutralize that redness so
I really like both of them so far but if
I had to pick one it would be this one
and then a four foundation I'm really
liking this foundation I think it looks
so beautiful it doesn't look too matte
but I don't look oily and I just I
really like it and the color is really
nice again I'm a medium honey the
packaging I'm not that big of a fan of
but for this kind of product this is
just what you're going to get I would
just use a clean q-tip or a spatula or
something to take the foundation out and
put it on your face just try not to put
your brush in it or whatever because
then I'll start having some bacteria but
I do really like this it doesn't feel
heavy or anything like that I will try
this without the correctors to see how
well it actually covers up redness as it
says it's completely full coverage and
covers up everything we're gonna see how
well it covers up rosacea I'll probably
include it like get ready with me or
something and we'll try it out then but
so far so damn good and then moving on
to the erase paste I do like this I feel
like for me it's not a necessity I don't
have super bad dark circles if I did
have really bad dark circles I would try
this out because that stamin color
really did brighten underneath my eyes
it's very creamy and it blended very
very well and even though this is really
creamy when I dragged it down a little
bit on my cheeks sometimes if a
concealer is a little too greasy or just
has too much going on it will make me
like right away which is what happened
in my last first impressions video but
this one hasn't done that it blended so
well and it doesn't make me look more
oily or anything like that so if you
have really bad dark circles I would
definitely check this out and then the
last thing is of course the blush in
cinematic I love these buildable blushes
I think they're 100% worth the money
they're very soft and they blend so well
I mean you guys saw it I had such rosy
cheeks and it just blended out to this
really gorgeous soft mauve color and I
love them right now I've only tried
Prizm and cinematic and they are really
really nice and I really love the
packaging of these they're really sleek
very lightweight and I love that you can
see the color on the front and also on
deep back yeah nothing negative to say
here so far I hope you guys enjoyed this
video don't forget if
you want like an end of the day review
