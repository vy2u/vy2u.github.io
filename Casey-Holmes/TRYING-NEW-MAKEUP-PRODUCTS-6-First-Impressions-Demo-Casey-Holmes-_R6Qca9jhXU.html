out some new products I have this little
stash right here that I've showed you
guys in a previous video and I just want
to like get deep into it and try some
new things out you guys know I love
trying like the five first impressions
all in one so that's what we're gonna do
today so we're just gonna hop right into
this video I don't necessarily know
exactly what I'm gonna try I just have a
few different things in front of me so
we're just gonna pick and choose and go
along with it okay so I tried this
foundation the other day but I want to
try it again I liked it the way that it
applied but I don't know I just didn't
really get to experience the full effect
because I had really dry skin I was
going through a time where I had a
sunburn this color is probably gonna be
a little bit off just because pretty
much all my foundations are off - the
cover old BB cream that I just did a
first impressions on but I really want
to play with this so I'll try to bronze
it up and make it match my body but I'm
not going anywhere so it really doesn't
matter to me
so my primer is ready to go and what I'm
gonna do is I'm just gonna dip my Beauty
Blender in here last time I applied this
I did apply it with a brush and I really
liked it that way too but I just want to
use the Beauty Blender this time I'm
just gonna apply this all over isn't a
terrible color it's just a little too
light this feels really good on the skin
like it doesn't feel heavy
I love the Marc Jacobs remarkable
foundation my boyfriend has told me that
you know sometimes it does look a little
too makeup Eve so that's just something
to keep in mind I personally love a full
cake face but you know this is more
sheer with a Beauty Blender then with a
brush does they have already tried it
with a brush might as well just say it
this is a little bit more sheer I
thought because of my forehead being
super sunburned that was a reason why it
looked so patchy but it's kind of
looking patchy right now and my
foreheads nice and smooth okay so this
is what it looks like it does kind of
look a little bit no it's kind of
separating a little bit on my forehead I
don't know if you guys didn't probably
tell probably not but separating a
little bit on my forehead but otherwise
it's pretty
there's still a little bit of redness
peeking through I feel like I definitely
got more coverage whenever I used a
brush so just keep that in mind I would
probably use a brush the brush that I
recommend and the one that I believe I
used is the market one as well
this is a pricy brush but honestly it
works so well with multiple foundations
I just love it and it's the face 3 brush
it's really nice it's pretty dense but
it's really soft and kind of flexible at
the same time so today I'm actually
using the Too Faced totally cute palette
this is a customizable palette well not
completely but they give you stickers
where you can stick them on the front
and make it your own now is opening my
PR I saw it and I was like oh I want to
do that right now
so this is what mine looks like of
course it has all the donuts and pizza
and everything on there
because I love food and then this is
what the inside looks like as you guys
saw on my Sephora haul I use this one as
a highlight and it was gorgeous
all of these are super pigmented so I'm
just gonna kind of play with them I
don't know exactly what I'm gonna do I'm
going to go ahead and go in with a
skintone color so I'm gonna take
ice-cream cutie which is this one right
here and I'm going to put this all over
the lid okay next up we're gonna use one
of my favorite shades which is bunny
foo-foo it's this orange color right
here and love this color for a
transition shade I've been really liking
this one for morphe it's the m500 to I
just really liked it a lot right now so
I'm gonna take it with that brush and
we're just gonna blend this into the
crease very lightly this is a really
pigmented palette recommend going it
with a light hand and then building your
way up
so I'm just building that color up
absolutely love this orange color it's
just so pretty the only thing about this
palette is if you don't like colored
eyeshadows you probably wouldn't like
this just because you don't have too
many neutrals I mean you have some great
neutrals and you can use the color ones
as like a pop of color but if you're not
a huge fan of color die shows at all you
probably won't like this palette so now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
in with chocolate donut and I'm just
gonna put this on too deep it up the
look
then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take
a blending brush again this is the Sigma
e25 going back down with bunny foo-foo
which is that orange color I'm just
gonna blend out the edges of that Brown
and I'm working kind of quickly but I'm
using very light pressure I really love
these shadows they just are so pigmented
and pretty and this is such a compact
palette too so far they're blending
fairly easily where starker shades are
always kind of more difficult to blend
so these are going pretty well this is
my favorite rush light pack on lid color
width or the inner corner in us the Mac
242 and I'm going to take the color the
confuse because there's like names on
this side and then names right here I'm
going to is mill highlight shade and I'm
gonna put this in the inner part of my
lid
that same brush we use like a bunny
foo-foo just very lightly blend out
those edges
and the last thing I'm going to do is
just go back in one more time with the
chocolate donut and the outer V you
really deepen that up and then blend it
out just a little bit and then while
you're here if you want to you could
drag it into the crease and blend out
whatever you feel like you need to and
then I'm gonna be using these flutter
lashes they're the Shayla flutter lashes
these are really nice I like them a lot
I'm gonna go ahead and put these on and
then I'll be right back to finish off
this look okay so now I'm gonna try
something different I got these in the
mail the other day they're the Clinique
uplifting illuminating powders I figured
I would try the bronze glow because it
hasn't really deep bronze glow to it and
I just wanted to test it out so this is
what the packaging looks like you just
pop it open right here and that's the
product on the inside it's definitely
more of a really warm bronzer I'm just
gonna take my benefit brush I like this
I was gonna use a different brush to
show you guys that's new but it's more
dense and this is like super dark so I
don't want to you know just gonna take a
little bit of this bronzer and put it on
the perimeters of my face okay that's
pretty I kind of like that actually
kind of matches my natural tan on cheeks
I'm taking a little bit here
okay I'm not liking this foundation it
was seriously breaking up the more I put
product on such a bummer I have my hopes
for it okay so I like this bronzer so
far but with this foundation it's just
not working like this foundation is
breaking up but this is really nice so
far I do like it edge and now to contour
I'm actually gonna take this TARDIS
contour I've only used it once and I
really liked it but I'm gonna take the
three and four
contour shade smells like chocolate
I'm going to is Real Techniques brush
this is the setting brush by like uses
for contour I'm gonna dip it in that
color
that what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take
this elf brush just like a little blush
brush I'm gonna use the blush in here
it's like a nice mauve pink it's very
pretty
I'm just gonna lightly dust this on my
cheeks oh that's pretty
it's not too intense but it's pretty and
now I'm gonna try out this lip liner
from the balm it's in fine apple and
really rose and this is what it looks
like twist up I'm guessing yes I love
that good
then I'm going to put on this Maybelline
Color jolt intense a lip paint in 0-5
stripped down
this looks pretty has like a little
applicator like this kinda well like
that does have a smell to it's kind of
like a fruity smell so then that is the
completed makeup look really quickly I'm
gonna do a rundown on the products that
I use if I miss something I will leave
it down below in the description box the
Too Faced totally cute palette I'm
obsessed with this palette I love the
concept of it I love that you could
customize it and I also love all of the
shadows in here everything is super
pigmented
you can do a really light look with this
you can do a fun colorful look or you
can do something like I did which is
just a little bit more deep but I love
this you could use this as a highlighter
you can use even use this one as a
highlighter whatever you wanted to do
this is a plus you definitely need this
palette in your life next up is the Marc
Jacobs marvelous mousse transformative
foundation I'm not a big fan of this
anymore I'm glad I tried it again for
first impressions and we could kind of
see how I feel but I really don't like
it I don't think it sets really well on
my skin I feel like it breaks up a lot
on my forehead and I just I don't really
like it now I don't know what it is
so unfortunately this is probably going
back it's just not my favorite it is
light weight I will give it that and it
is pretty full coverage I would say it's
more medium to full coverage with the
Beauty Blender and then it's a little
bit more full coverage if you just use a
brush which I prefer the brush
definitely over Beauty Blender with this
product but yeah it's just not my
favorite I have others that I think are
way better so this will be going back
for sure
next up is this Clinique uplighting
illuminating powder this is the bronze
glow which is the bronzer that I use I
really like the bronzer it's definitely
like a warm toned tan bronzer which I
love it it does kind of have the hints
of a glow to it but it's not too intense
but it does give you that nice bronzed
look next thing I use I've used this
before but I wanted to do it again in
this video is the tardis contour palette
I do love this shade right here to
contour I think it's perfect it's the
three and four contour shade you have a
banana shade
and then a really light highlighting
powder and then you have this blush
which is actually really nice and very
pigmented
I love the Mavi pink you also have a
darker contour shade in this I love this
palette I think it's so convenient to
travel with and then you guys saw me use
this pick up liner I really liked it it
was really creamy and smooth I don't
know how long it lasts but I think this
is a really nice lip liner and I love
that it's a retractable pencil like it
looks like just a regular pencil but it
does retract so just keep that in mind
if you do end up purchasing it but I
really like this color and then I use
the Maybelline jolt which is a glossy
lip paint which basically it's just a
really pigmented lip gloss but I really
like it it's not too glossy it's not
sticky it does have a slight scent but
it doesn't bother me like some other
scented things have that they have put
out so I really like it so far and this
is my kind of color it's in 0-5 just a
nice nude eye is it for this video I
really hope you guys enjoyed it thank
you so much for watching if you do like
these videos don't forget to give a
thumbs up and let me know in the
comments and I will see you all in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
