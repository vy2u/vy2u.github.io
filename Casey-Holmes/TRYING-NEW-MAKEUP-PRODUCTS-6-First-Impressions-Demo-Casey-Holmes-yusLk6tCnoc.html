impressions video again I have six
products to try out for you guys just
new things that I've been sent that I
haven't touched before so that's what
we're gonna do today I'm also going to
show you a foundation I've been loving I
did it first impression on it the other
day but I believe that's going to be up
before this one so you probably already
know what I'm gonna talk about because
it's amazing but I'm going to go ahead
and just put clips in my hair I'm gonna
put close to my hair real quick just to
keep my hair back I'm gonna just prep my
eyes because I did get some new Kat Von
D quads in the mail and I was actually
gonna purchase the I was really happy
when I saw that they were at my door I
showed it on my vlog channel if you guys
don't know I do have a vlog channel
which is why I showed all the quads so
if you want to check that out I will
link it down below I'm just taking my
NARS smudge proof eyeshadow primer I've
talked about this for so long it's just
really really good if you have oily
eyelids and this is the Kat Von D shade
+ light eye contour quad this one is in
the shade I don't know hmmmm wolf I go
so these are the colors that is in this
quad I just wanted to do something a
little bit more cool toned and I thought
these are really pretty so again so it
looks like it has the same font as the
shade and light palette which I enjoy
and those palettes are really great some
I have pretty high hopes for this and
you get this is so cute I have not seen
this in person is this great packaging
this is what the packaging looks like it
kind of has D I forget what you call
this but like 3d font right here that is
adorable I love that it's so like
high-quality I'm impressed I don't
really want to apply a liner today so
I'm gonna try a look where I don't have
to apply liner other than in the inner
corner because I am going to put some
false lashes on but I just don't feel
like doing a wing today it's really nice
and thin too so these are really
gorgeous I love greens anything like
that and the only thing I wish is that
this would pop back more like it would
go all the way back but you do have a
little mirror in there as well
I am going to apply just a little bit of
tape because you know me have downturned
eyes so this is what I do every single
time first thing we're going to do is
run
take this cream shade right here and
just put that all over the lid to have a
little base down whoo so pigmented my
face is feeling so dry right now and
he's in the Smashbox primer water like
pronto okay next I'm going to take this
shade right here which is the base shade
oh I didn't even okay this was this was
the base this is to define the contour
in the highlight I'm gonna kind of just
work with whatever this was this is a
nice mid tone shade so I'm just going to
put that into my crease I'm going to use
a blending brush it's like a perfect
transition color I like that there is
quite a bit of fallout if that bothers
you it doesn't bother me as long as the
products good and it blends well but
there is a little bit I absolutely love
this I still use it as the Sephora color
switch I love it I love it I love it I
think this is just so good I use it all
the time probably one of my best
purchases in a while this kind of gray
color right here I'm actually going to
put this all over my lid
and then I'm going to take a blending
brush I'm just going to use this one
from Sigma it's the e25 I dip into this
green tap off and put this into the
crease mainly in the a derby I'm just
dragging into the crease to blend out
that gray it's not like a super intense
crazy look you know like dramatic colors
but it's a way to wear green and wear
like Grey's and stuff in a comfortable
way it's not too bold I just dipped into
the grey and I'm going to just blend
these two together right here just so
there's not harsh lines I feel like the
gray is it's really pretty but I feel
like it's a little bit more to work with
like I really have to work with this
color to keep it on and looking nice so
really quickly I want to show you I
haven't blown on this palette anything
to get rid of the fallout but this is
what it starts to look like so you can
see there's quite a bit of fallout and
then you blow it all away and it looks
literally brand new so just people
warned of that I think I'm just gonna
apply liner to the top lashes but not do
a wing so I'm just going to take my
makeup forever ink liner this is one of
my favorite matte super black eyeliners
okay so now what I'm going to do is
apply lashes I'm using new pair lashes
these are the SC ito SML collab which is
Stephanie's collab and they are gorgeous
they say they have out of 5 dots they
have 4 dots of volume if that makes any
sense but this is who Stephanie is if
you guys don't know and she came out
with these lashes with them and they are
so pretty we take them out of this
packaging so you can really see nice in
full I like them a lot
so I'm just going to go ahead and apply
these first I need to apply some liner
to my upper waterline if you guys want a
more in-depth kind of talk through of me
applying false lashes I posted a orange
makeup look with a Kylie lip kit and I
talked a little bit more in that video
about how I apply lashes and what lash
glue is my favorite and some of my
favorite lashes as well so you could
check that out down below okay so the
lashes are on I think they're so pretty
they're not too dramatic think they're
perfect
so congratulations Stephanie on your
collab moving on I'm gonna apply
foundation I'm using the clink beyond
perfecting foundation and concealer in
one I'm in eighth golden and neutral yes
I really like this foundation I think
it's great so I'm just gonna apply some
of this probably a little dark but we're
just gonna bronze everything else to
make it match cuz I love this foundation
while this bakes I'm gonna do my
eyebrows but then we'll come back and do
bronzer with this new I don't think this
is like brand new but it's the it
cosmetics you sculpted like it's a
contour and highlighting kit I also have
some highlighters from sleek and a blush
from sleek that I haven't tried before
oh then for lips are going to try the
NYX lingerie liquid lipstick so I'll be
right back and we will do some more
first impressions okay now we're going
to move on to bronzer I've already
dusted away the powder that I had baking
this is the it sculpted universal
contouring palette for face and body so
this is what it looks like with a nice
little pretty girl on there I hate the
way this feels and sounds oh I was like
a styrofoam that's disgusting so this is
what the palette looks like and you have
a bunch of different little info packets
back here I've shown you how to contour
your nose your cheekbones things like
that so if you're interested they do
have everything back here but then you
open it up and you have a cute little
mirror and you have all of the
contouring and bronzing shades I'm gonna
bronze my face is something different
this medium contour looks really really
warm so I don't want to brown my face
with that so I'm just going to take this
Too Faced sweethearts bronzer in sweet
tea with this hula or this hula with
this benefit bronzer brush okay so the
color I'm going to take is actually D
medium contour to contour with deep
contour looks just way yeah way too dark
for me that's deep contour right there
that was super pigmented wow that's
intense what is medium contour and this
one is light contour that's a little
pink and this is soft contour which is a
little bit too light a little ashy so
I'm definitely gonna go with the medium
one even though the medium one looks
very warm the deep contour is just not
going to work so I'm going to take a
little bit more of a fluffy brush these
looks SuperDuper pigmented so I don't
want to go too heavy with them gonna
take that medium contour shade we told
me and we're gonna contour with this I
get so nervous using new contour
sometimes we're just gonna lightly put
this right in here it looks pretty good
I'm like barely touching my face oh it's
dipped into the deep contour this is
cool I feel like if you're a makeup
artist you could definitely use this for
multiple clients you could have very
deep dark skin or very fair skin so I
think that's awesome again we're just
gonna very lightly kind of carve this
out wow this is intense put a little bit
under here so I'm going to take my color
wheel and just get any excess product
off because I don't want more of this
contour shade on my cheeks than what I
have right now I'm just going to blend
those to blend out very easily
I like and I actually like this color
for my skin if I were to get more fair I
could use of course the light contour to
contour with what do you guys think let
me know in the comments I think it looks
good it doesn't look too warm on my face
which I enjoy I was kind of worried
about that but it doesn't look that bad
at all now I'm going in with this
sleek blush by three palette this is in
the shade lace 367 oh no it's looking
powdery please don't we broke okay it's
not broke oh you guys know I love Orange
blushes and this looks gorgeous this is
not gonna go with the look at all um but
we're going to work with it so I'm
actually going to take this shade right
here it's the lightest one of the bunch
and they are very vibrant so I'm going
to take the lightest one of the bunch
and just lightly dust this over my
cheeks
looks a little like patchy but it's not
anything I can't blend out so let's see
I like the subtle hint of orange with
this look I didn't want to I didn't
really want to do a really you know warm
blush since the eyes more cool but I
kind of liked it and the packaging made
it look like made it look like the
middle shade it looks kind of orange on
camera but this one right here on the
packaging looks more like a bronze
that's the one I was going to shoot for
but they're all orange that's nice
though they're very pigmented and I like
that they have three colors in one let
me see what that middle shade looks like
wow I don't think I would ever use that
as a blush that would accentuate my
pores so much they're so Mia on that
they're not coming off as bright on
camera then there is a sleek
highlighting palette I send this stuff
to me forever ago I just haven't been
able to try it out because I've been so
caught up with other things
this one has nicer packaging just looks
like this are these creams okay there's
a powered one in here but the rest are
like creams I don't want to cream
highlight this hey cream highlight on
there precious metals highlighting
palette I don't like that there's one
powder highlighting here which is this
one let's just see what it looks like on
the cheekbones okay so the only powdered
one is right here the rest are cream
it's not like super bright but
definitely has like a nice highlight to
it so yeah that's pretty alright alright
came out better than I expected
I give it that but that palette is not
how would you say it's not something I
would gravitate towards especially since
there's three creams in one powder
product that's not my kind of thing I'm
just gonna top it off with bubbly right
here from the Anastacio glow kit this is
in that glow just gonna put this right
here to make it all pop you feels yes ah
Nastasia now for the lips are going to
try this NYX lingerie push-up well
push-up is the name but it's this NYX
lingerie lip liquid lipstick I've been
trying out Kylie Jenner's lip kits and I
will tell you guys how I feel about them
very soon but I wanted to try this
out I suck at taking off packaging I'll
always just like twisted open and I'm
like whatever it'll be fine so keeping
this drug start I'm taking the Palladio
gingerbread lip liner I've used this for
so long and I just love it then this is
again in the color pushup ooh
the applicator oh it feels really good
like rubbing it between my lips
so if I really like the applicator feel
like it's easy to apply then let's go
with the eyes it's not overpowering but
it's not like a super light nude so far
it feels really good don't forget to
check the description box of this video
because I always update you guys usually
I wear it throughout the day and then
I'll update you in the description box
what I think of these products so it's
not like a super-duper long video I want
to give you a rundown real quick of what
I use this shade and light palette I
really do like I love the colors I think
if you found a palette that fit your
needs for everyday this would be a great
everyday palette you could toss it in
your purse you could take it traveling
whatever so I really like it I love the
packaging and I love the shadows her
formula isn't really different at all
it's basically the same formula with all
of her different eyeshadows there is a
ton of fall out so again if fallout
bothers you it will probably bother you
with this palette but like I said it
doesn't bother me and I really like this
so far and then I do like this it
cosmetics you sculpted I don't feel like
it's an everyday thing for me I think
this is definitely more for someone who
is doing makeup all the time because you
have so many different shades to choose
from for everybody but for me I would be
the medium contour right now that's
again what I have on my face I really
liked it it blended out really really
well and I haven't tried the
highlighters yet I probably should have
in this video but everything is really
smooth and creamy and so far blends
really well they did send this to me but
it's not something I would probably buy
because I feel like most of the shades
just aren't what I would use and it
would be a waste for me to buy a whole
palette while they just sell them
individually so hopefully they can come
out with these individually but this is
such a nice palette okay the next thing
I tried out is this blush by 3 palette
from sleek makeup in the shade lace I
really like them again they are not
coming off as bright and fluorescent as
they actually are but these are
definitely colors for if you love orange
blushes or anything you would absolutely
adore this palette I would never use
this because it's way too shimmery and I
feel like it's kind of like a
highlighter blush I feel like it would
attract way too much light on my cheeks
and draw attention to my pores which is
what I want to avoid at all cost
but these two max shades right here are
really pretty for this sleek makeup
highlighting palette I don't like that
there's three creams in a powder I would
have probably preferred this if it was
all powdered products this was a nice
highlighter but again I wouldn't want to
purchase it because I wouldn't want to
purchase a pallet just to use one item
out of it you know what I'm saying like
I want to get the use out of a pallet I
like cream highlighters but I got to be
in the mood for them and I got to know
that I'm about to have some cream
highlighters and I had no idea this was
mostly cream highlighter so and so far
this NYX lingerie liquid lipstick is
nice I really love the color I think it
applied really well and I love the
applicator on it it's really nice and
slam has a little bit of a tilt to it
and it really got the Cupid's bow nicely
so so far I'm liking it but again in the
description box I will keep you updated
on how it wears throughout the day so
that is it for this video I hope you
guys enjoyed it don't forget I will be
doing first impression updates I do too
first impressions videos and then an
update so just stay tuned for that don't
forget to give this video a thumbs up if
