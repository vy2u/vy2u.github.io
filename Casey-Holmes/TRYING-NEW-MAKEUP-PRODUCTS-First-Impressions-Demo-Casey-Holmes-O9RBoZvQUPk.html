with another makeup video and I recently
just got some things in the mail I'm
probably gonna do a haul a pony after
this one because I feel like I need to
break up the hauls a little bit but I
wanted to take a few things out of that
haul and kind of just test them out for
the first time and let you guys know
what I thought of them I did this video
a couple weeks ago or a few weeks ago
and everybody seemed to really like it
so I figured I would do it again I have
a bunch of different stuff to try for
you today so I'm really excited about it
so if you do like in these kinds of
videos don't forget to give it a thumbs
up and subscribe to my channel you guys
want to see me try out 11 new products
then let's just go ahead and get started
so I placed an order with Sephora and
Ulta and the first thing that I'm going
to do is I'm actually going to prime and
this is from soap &amp;amp; Glory one heck of a
blot instant perfecting power primer and
it's supposed to keep you met and have
poor shrink technology and it says
supposed to actually keep you mat for 12
hours just says shine block but we know
they mean met I did not know 7 Glory had
makeup products I just thought they were
bath products so this is what the tube
looks like it's really similar to the
makeup forever primers it feels like it
too so first off it just looks like a
moisturizer to me I'm going to just pick
this on my hands or my fingers I'm going
to put this all in the t-zone it doesn't
have a smell to it or anything
and it feels really good it just feels
like just like a moisturizer and it's
singing in pretty quickly like I can
feel it starting to get tacky but the
first thing I want to try out is from Al
genis this is a green color corrects
redness and its color concentrated
correcting drops I don't know how some
people use this I think some people mix
it in with the foundation and some
people just apply to their skin I'm
gonna try half of my face with this
foundation half of my face with the
green corrector since it says that
you're supposed to apply it with
foundation so I'm gonna listen to the
box and do that okay so this primer
feels really good by the way it's just
it's me
and it doesn't feel like overly
mattifying but I can tell it modified a
lot of my face because my forehead was
shiny before I applied it so so far so
good with that primer is this a
foundation I'm going to use to see one
heck of a blot all day liquid to powder
foundation and again this kind of has
the same claims as the primer but it's
supposed to control shine for 12 hour
deliver flawless full coverage no
cakiness blur away the appearance of
pores and imperfections it says that you
can use your fingers or brush to dab a
few dots and then blend it looks like it
might match I'll have to probably drag
it down my neck quite a bit and blend in
some bronzer but this is in the shade I
have no idea what shade this is in I
mean there's numbers on the bottom that
says to one east - see but I don't think
that's the I don't know what the color
is guys it's a little bit runny but not
too much it still looks pretty thick so
I'm just gonna take my Marc Jacobs de
face number three brush I love this
brush for foundation and I'm going to
dab some on this brush and I'm going to
blend it into what side dial 1 this side
has like a lot more redness than this
side will blend it to this side and just
see what the coverage is like
surprisingly enough that a color is
probably gonna match me
I feel like this is more of a medium to
full coverage foundation why is my neck
like white down here don't know it's
definitely a medium coverage foundation
but it does like it does look good on
the skin let's see if I can build this
up but it has a really pretty finish and
I really like this color it's not very
warm and it's not too yellow it's has
that perfect kind of all of the
undertone so so far I mean without the
green primer I think this looks great
it does feel a little tacky right now so
you can just see the difference between
this on my face and this on my face and
this actually my pores don't look bad at
all like this looks really good now I'm
going to just take this and it says to
shake it well and just mix it with your
foundation this is such a nice packaging
it has like a suction as you pull out
the dropper so I'm just going to drop a
couple drops because that was that looks
like a lot that's what it looks like
right there I don't know but the one
thing about these green primers is well
mainly just this one I wasn't too sure
if I was going to like mixing it with
foundation because I feel like it would
just work better if you just went ahead
and applied it to your skin and then
foundation overtop but if I mean I might
try that but since it's so concentrated
I just want to be careful with it
because I don't want it to like break me
out or anything possibly I would have to
say I wouldn't mix the primer with this
one because I don't feel like it makes
that big of a difference okay so the
next thing I want to try out is this NYX
gotcha Covered concealer and it's
waterproof and it's in the color beige
so this full coverage with the dewy
finish and all-day wear
look I just put like a bunch of matte
products on my face and how this says
it's dewy oh Lord
so it just comes in a little tube like
this and it
is a squeezy to squeeze some on the back
of my hand wow this is not coming out oh
that is thick that is a thick concealer
I could barely squeeze it out is to see
that oh my god okay I'm going to apply
this underneath my eyes I feel like I
need a beauty builder for this one since
it's so sticky
we'll try a brush with the side it's
definitely going to be doing I feel like
me putting this down in my t-zone
is going to make me Whaley I guess I'll
just blend it with this brush this brush
is too damn big ok so I feel like it
looks really good like it's really
brightening it feels good so far and
it's not so doing to where I'm blending
it out and I'm seeing shine but like
that that looks so good that just
brightened up my whole face just
blending out so well I'm really liking
this so far I'm going to take someone
back of my hand and put it down my nose
and then I'm going to leave the rest of
my face kind of blank like my forehead
and chin because I just want to leave
those the way they are just to see if I
go in those areas because usually if I
get oily here I'm going to get oily up
here and I want to see if I get oily
under my eyes and like in my cheek area
first before there feel like you have to
set this like a hundred percent so I'm
gonna take the NYX HD finishing powder
this is in the banana shade I feel like
if I scratch my face right now
I'm going to scratch off this concealer
because my face is itching right now oh
so I'm just going to take the same brush
I always use this is the Sigma tapered
highlighter I like it for underneath my
eyes I'm just gonna take this shade this
has a very subtle banana tint I can
already tell that concealers making me a
little boy Lee but this powder is nice
my skin looks really good like I kind of
look poreless and sometimes that never
happens especially with these bright
lights in front of me I feel like it
makes everything worse and also the rest
of the foundation set in too
and really nicely like it's not sticky
or anything so that is a plus I don't
think this concealers gonna work for me
just off the bat I think maybe if you
have more dry skin you might like it but
then again it might make you a little
oily um I can tell so far it's still
really sticky and I just put like a
buttload of powder on and that sucks cuz
I really like the coverage and the
finish of it but I do not think this is
going to hold up well with my oily skin
at all then moving on I'm going to take
this NYX cheek contour duo palette and
this is in the shade oh one I'm guessing
this has really cute packaging it has
like these this little pyramid effect
right here I'm digging it I don't know
if this shut if this one is supposed to
be what you highlight your face with or
set your under eyes with blue wow this
is definitely more of a warm toned
bronzer oh yeah that's super warm if I
can bronze my face with this one so I'm
gonna take this benefit bronzing and
contouring brush this is so cute
this is so you it is so soft and I'm
obsessed with the way that this looks I
just love it okay so I'm just going to
take this brush from benefit and kind of
like toss it in here a little bit it's
um this is a really powdery bronzer just
FYI has a lot fallout wow this brush is
so soft it's really bronzing the skin
nicely actually
I feel like the contour pattern this
would be great to bronze why is it so
bright god I didn't realize how bright
my light was I don't know how fill that
quite yet I really don't like duo things
like this I mean sometimes I do like
those Kat Von D blushes which got taken
off the shelves which is really
depressing cuz I like the one I have oh
goodness rush but not work this brush
just kind of contoured and bronze my
face all at the same time look at that
this brush like contoured my face and I
have to do thing this concealer is not
going to work for me it's already
getting shiny contoured and bronze
that's awesome this is a win-win in my
book and I do like this I again I don't
know if this is supposed to be for your
cheekbones or not it doesn't really have
like that much of a sheen to it um but
it's a pinky tone and I personally would
not put this underneath my eyes so this
is a go I like this but I don't know
about this yet also something new by NYX
is this ombre blush I am so pumped about
this it looks so beautiful online and
this is in the shade nude to me new to
me Oh nicely packaged so this is what
the front looks like I kind of wish this
was clear but I can't always have it my
way and that is gorgeous
that looks beautiful just the way that
it fades ooh that is a gorgeous color
that is like Hello bronze goddess look
at that swirl though I'm loving that
this is like a golden sheen and this is
more of like a bronzy rusty shade I
don't know but that is they're pretty
together so I'm just gonna kind of work
my brush in there tap off the excess oh
good I really like it it's kind of like
a bronzer too I feel like you could use
this and not even use any bronzer all
right I'm gonna blend it out hopefully
it blends out really nicely I'm just
gonna take my stippling brush just blend
this out oh my god this concealer do you
see it get
so shining right there I like this blush
I mean I could do a little less next
time but I really like it I think it
looks really pretty on the skin okay and
now for a highlighter I'm gonna use the
laura geller baked gelato swirl
illuminator and gilded honey you guys I
have been trying to get this for so long
I only got it and it is some mall but
that's okay because how often I mean
well I'll use highlighter a lot but see
what you're working with hair that's
just beautiful though and I love that it
has a clear top to it oh oh yeah that
that's my kind of highlight I'm gonna
need another one
I should probably buy a backup because
it took me forever to get this frickin
thing I'm kind of over doing it right
now just cuz I'm so excited this for
summer is oh my god I love this this
gets like an a-plus-plus from me it is
so beautiful it's so pigmented I am so
happy that I got this okay so I'm going
to go ahead and finish up the rest of my
makeup my brows and all of that so I'm
gonna do that and I will be right back
to finish off with a low liquid lipstick
that I have been dying to try okay so
now I have my brows done and my eyes are
finished and now we're going to move on
to lips and I'm going to be using the
Anastasia Beverly Hills liquid lipstick
in pure Hollywood I've been wanting to
try these so bad I'm gonna try this out
with this Urban Decay Gwen Stefani
ex-girlfriend lip liner which is one of
my favorite lip liners I think it is
amazing now lately I have been trying
dose of colors like with lipstick and I
love them I'm really obsessed I've been
using mood and desert suede so much I
saw the like chocolate fraida what's
called that's like a chocolate one I
have yet to use that but I cannot wait
and
I hope this one is just as good as those
I can't remember I think I watched your
views on these when I first came out I
think people said they were drying but I
don't remember so again this one is in
the shade pure Hollywood it's just like
a pinky nude goes on really smoothly so
why not really nicely I feel like it
needs a little something extra so I'm
going to take this NARS shadow that I
put underneath my brows I use this
underneath my brows and in the inner
corner of my eyes and I'm obsessed with
it and that was really aggressive but
this is in the color oh hello this is in
the color mortal just a nice really
shimmery color I like that a little
better has like a little bit of
dimension to it it feels really
comfortable so far and I like it a lot
better with that eye shadow on top just
to kind of give it a little something
extra I would put a lip gloss on but I
want to wear this throughout this video
and another video I'm filming after this
one and if you guys want an update video
