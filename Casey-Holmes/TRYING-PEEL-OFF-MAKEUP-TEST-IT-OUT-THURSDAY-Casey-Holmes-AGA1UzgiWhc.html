guys don't follow me on snapchat which
you should I will put my snapchat
somewhere in here
um but I have been redecorating my
office to be another filming space I
love the filming space that I have in my
beauty room where you see the trees in
the background but I also kind of just
wanted like something outside of that
just to kind of switch it up be a little
bit different have a lot of things going
on in here I might give you guys an
office tour if you want one or I might
just wait till do a house tour because I
plan on doing a house tour as well um
but I figured I would try this out first
and see how you guys like it so if you
guys have any suggestions on anything
I'm deciding if I should or is that I'm
deciding if I should keep this up here
or bring it down level with this one the
reason why I had it up is because I was
inspired by regal whenever I filmed with
them they had like two different leveled
things and I thought it was cute in this
little deer right here I just love it I
got everything from Hobby Lobby by the
way but the lights I did get from TJ
Maxx and of course I had a dog where's
that of course I have a dog
any cute anyways this video is not about
home decor or anything like that it is
about peel-off make up watched one girl
do this and her brows looked so good she
did leave it on for two hours so that's
what I'm gonna do as well I will say
these took absolutely forever to come in
I ordered them April 24th they came late
June so just keep that in mind when
you're ordering these off of Amazon I
would just go with like the regular ship
ring and not like doing ding crazy
because it's not worth the extra money
it's gonna take a while anyways so this
peel-off brow is 8-18 and the peel-off
flip is 3:58 the one thing I've noticed
about this is you cannot talk whenever
you waiting for this to dry so when I
apply this I'm not really going to talk
at all the shade that I got is romantic
bear I don't really know what color this
is I'm missing like a pink red I have no
makeup on it says to apply this with a
completely bare face it says apply a
liberal amount to remove the pack easily
so whenever you apply it on just make
sure you put enough on to easily take it
off dry for at least two hours for
stronger coloration apply before going
to bed at night and remove the next
morning after dry and completely removed
slowly starting from the head of the
eyebrow do not remove it forcefully
since it may pull out the eyebrow do not
use a cleansing product or apply force
on the eyebrow within 24 hours of using
the product it also says if you make a
mistake why playing with a cotton swab
or clean tissue let me go get some
cotton swabs real quick before I start
this video okay so we got these q-tips
precision tips these are amazing if you
have not used these and you love makeup
or you just love doing your nails or
anything you need them because they have
a pointed end and they're just they're
awesome so let's start with the brows
first I got the shade number one brown I
don't think I'm pretty sure I don't
remember there being like a lot of color
choices so I think I just went with this
one hopefully it's not too crazy with my
light hair just gonna fill up my brows
with this product and hopefully not get
it in my hair this is like super easy to
apply so far what I'm noticing this is
the part I'm scared about right in here
it was kind of cool though like it does
have a cooling sensation but it feels
cool it's like I'm like putting foot
roll on my eyebrows and I've never put
fruit roll-up on my eyebrows wow that is
a strong brow look at the difference
though like even when I fill is brow and
you're like damn definitely leaving this
on for two hours though cuz the best
results I've seen are left on for two
hours not just when it dries what's
going on with mommy doing to our brows
okay let's not move mommy rose this is a
serious thing we're doing right here
okay the brows are on and if you feel
them drying already it's just so quick I
will say though that this was so easy to
apply like it just glided over the brows
I don't know how the inner corner is
going to be on me yet especially after
it dries but hopefully it's not too
intense but there wasn't really a way to
apply it without applying quite a bit of
product
so you could peel it all off in the end
that's what I wanted to make sure of was
that I put enough on so it was easy to
peel off and then they didn't have to go
in with like something else to kind of
scrub it out because I might wear them
the whole purpose of the brow but now
we're going to try the lip tint and
right now it is 4:13 and we're gonna
leave that out until 613 I don't know
how long this lip color takes but I'm
just gonna wait till it dries we're
going to apply this I'm not going to
talk we're going to see how it works I'm
going to try not to talk okay so I'm
going to just up but you guys want to
think about it after I put it on and
after we get everything going never saw
this one
smells like tequila I said we're gonna
talk but it smells like tequila
so I did lip stuff I was down around 416
is for 28 now and it feels dry like it's
silky
there's no stickiness to it it's just
ready to be peeled off so we're going to
peel this it's kind of like sticking
right here whoa Wow
oh that was super easy my application
was super messy I was trying to get it
as clean around the lines as possible
and as you can see it really doesn't
look bad it looks like you drank some
kool-aid or something and it stained
your lips or you ate a popsicle anything
like that that's what it looks like I
didn't have an issue with it going into
my teeth I didn't go too far back on my
lips I kind of kept it more here towards
the front and like I said I did not
really talk whenever I applied it and
waited for dry it takes about ten
minutes to completely dry up at least on
me it did and I do feel like it took a
lot of product to get it evenly on my
lips it was very very sticky did leave a
nice stain on my lips
this is not something that I will use
everyday or anything like that but if
you personally like the look of more
stained lips like just lip stains and
things like that I think you might like
this it's not terrible so now we have
about an hour and a half before we have
to take these brows off so we're gonna
wait a little while longer
I'll be back to give you guys an update
okay so we're back it's officially been
a little over two hours it's 6:17 right
now so we're gonna peel off these brows
I'm like really excited
I hope these turned out well I don't
think we're not well so let's just start
wanting to know how to start peeling
this off
you
okay so mine's not is easy to peel off
as everyone else's was from what I'm
seeing it definitely worked
look at that brow all I needs like a
spoolie to go in and maybe like touch up
the outer half but the best part this is
legit what that looks like a good brow
I'm like super impressed right now okay
let's hope I get this one off pretty
easily I have seen a couple brow hairs
come out I will say that there's one
right there I saw one on this side but I
know my neighbor's probably what the she
doing doesn't hurt though there is a
good one
all that was good this brow is
definitely going a lot better and then
this brow did which this Browns usually
my good brow so why am I not surprised
so I'm super impressed like this
actually turned out really well the
shape looks really good the color looks
really good I've everything off there's
like a little bit of flakes around here
just that I had to clean off but this
brow obviously is my good brow I don't
know why but it's always my good brow
this one was easiest to peel off and I
feel like it looks the best this one I
could fill in a little bit right here
I am definitely probably gonna use this
more because a it's kind of fun to peel
off it's kind of satisfying and I wonder
how dark this would get if I did leave
it on overnight so I'm gonna have to try
and give you guys an update on that like
this is like the perfect Brown so like
all I need is two hours definitely think
it's worth the money how much with this
818 yes this saves me so much time like
if I want to do my makeup right now I
don't have to do brows okay guys so that
is it for this video if you had to get
one thing from this I would definitely
recommend the brow product I think it is
awesome saves you so much time and it's
so easy to do so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video if you did don't forget to
give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my
channel and also leave a comment down
below give any fun test out Thursday's
that you want me to do a lot of you sub
