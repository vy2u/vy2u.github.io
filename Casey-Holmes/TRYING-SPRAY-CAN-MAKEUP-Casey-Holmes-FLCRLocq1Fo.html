today I have something very fun to test
out for you and I'm really excited to
see if this will work if it doesn't work
I've only ever tried spray foundations
before but we're couples on all two the
other day buying some drugstore stuff
you guys will probably see it very soon
I think I'm gonna do an Ulta haul I
think I am but I saw these barely sheer
airbrush cosmetics spray on bronzer and
spray on blush and I was like I need to
try that so they're very annoying
they sound like spray paint cans like
for real or the bronzer says sunkissed
radiant streak free spray on bronzer and
supposedly you just have to shake both
cans for five minutes and then hold can
six to eight inches away from your face
and spray using light pulses we're going
to try these out and see if they work
today or see if they're a hot mess cuz
sometimes these things can be a hot mess
so I'm going to try to spray it on this
side of my face and hopefully it works
out if not I'll try to spray on a brush
and see if I can use it on this side
this brand is on Ulta online I think
it's it says only at old ten I believe
it's only online I've never seen it in
store but they have D blushes which are
$12.99 they have three colors they have
a spray-on face primer spray on bronzer
which I'm going to show you guys sure
stay setting powder spray on body mist
shimmer which has a terrible review has
won stars they barely share Kabuki
sponge so that's all they have they
don't really have too much going on with
their section at Ulta but you know we're
gonna test it out we're going to see if
it's good stuff let's do it and it was
only $12.99 at least it wasn't like that
Dior foundation that I tried years ago
do we remember that who has been here
since I tried out that Dior foundation
let me know I would love to know I'm
going to go ahead and do bronzer first
and I'm going to shake it for five
seconds like it says to and this is what
the packaging looks like by the way I
actually think it's really nice it looks
really pretty before I start shaking and
bacon I did apply a new foundation I've
been really liking if you follow me on
snapchat which if you don't go follow me
on snapchat I think I want to start
doing like little reviews on snapchat I
was doing like a kind of tested out on
this and I
really do like this so far I think it's
awesome foundation I'm wearing now this
is the Fiona styles matte finish
foundation and I got this at Ulta as
well I can't remember how much it was
it's in the shade 0-5 this is a little
too dark for me but it's perfect when I
self-tan of it right now you know just a
smidge dark so far I'm loving this and
I'm also wearing the Tarte shape tape
concealer and the Smashbox Studios skin
24-hour combined underneath my eyes so I
figured I would tell you what was on my
face and let's go ahead and shake this
baby up and you get one fluid ounce by
the way okay guys I took the lid off and
the spray thingy came off so let's try
to put that back on let's pray
yourselves is that shimmer No okay so
we're just gonna try to spray this I
didn't do the rest of my face makeup I'm
wearing just a West Point hoodie because
you know if I get it dirty it's okay
that's what my hair up so let's just
hope it turns out for the best so six to
eight inches away from face it says
light pulses I don't even know where I'm
spraying this honestly
whoa
I see it I think where's that my mind I
feel like I see it
I feel like I see it
I know it says light pulses but I mean
sometimes I feel like it's just
squirting out air like now I feel like
this side looks bronze but I don't know
if it's like me seeing things I feel
like it looks bronze but it's not very
intense like it's not a dark bronzer
whoa
there's a little you definitely need to
shake it up a little more to get more of
the color what's going on okay we're
having some malfunctioning issues okay
yeah that's bronze I mean it is a pretty
bronzer you can see it it's like a
natural tan I'll tell you what though
it's been malfunctioning a little bit
like I'll feel it on my face and then
all of a sudden it goes to air and you
have to shake it up again so you
definitely need to continuously shake it
I'm probably using more than the average
person but I just love bronzer do a
little more got a light runs out so
quickly I'm going to go through this
whole freaking bottle it's a very
natural looking bronzer though like I
really like the color that is giving I
kind of like it um I think it's cool
let's do the blush now let's see let's
hope we can see a difference so I went
with the shade rose I like to apply
blush to the apples of my cheeks and
then back some people like to stay away
from their apples I personally like to
apply it there so we're gonna try to do
that without looking like a clown ah the
top popped off again where I'm kind of
scared for this one
I don't see any blush it's there it's
the color of it right there but oh I see
it okay
okay I'm seeing it now make sure you
have a fan going I don't have a fan in
here unfortunately I would definitely
use less of the blush and more of the
bronzer just because I personally love
bronzer I like to look pretty tan I do
see the little bit of flush that the
blush gives this is kind of I think this
is like the lighter shade you can see
right here on my apples a little bit
where that pink is and definitely in
person I can see it I'm just looking at
the viewfinder and like I don't know if
you guys can but I can definitely see it
I don't want to do any more blush
because it's just going to be too
intense I definitely saw the bronzer I
do like the bronzer but the only thing I
noticed I don't know if it's because I
used so much of the bronzer but I had to
continuously shake it and spray it on my
face one thing I will say is it really
did not get all up in my hair which is
impressive usually like especially Spray
foundations they will get everywhere and
you're just looking like a hot wait oh
my god I literally said that and I see
it in my hair right here do you guys see
that see that paint pen just be cautious
when you're spraying it on your face
that you don't get it too much in your
hair I was kind of worried about that
with bronzer I thought I was going to
everywhere but I really did it it
doesn't feel super makeup B at all um
one thing I will say is that it feels
kind of just feels like a cream that you
haven't set on your face that's what it
feels like to me
so I would probably take a translucent
powder and use a Beauty Blender or use a
duo fiber brush and get a really light
amount on there here I'll show you
I'm gonna take my flower Beauty powder
and take a little bit of that and just
lightly dust it over just to set it
what'd I say that I would purchase it
again and use it again probably not I'm
a huge fan of powder bronzers and like
having a lot of control even though this
is beautiful I really like the bronzer I
think it's going to be great for like my
neck and my chest
she really bronzed it up if I need it to
match my foundation for the day or
something
because I tend to always have to do that
since I do self-tan or whatever it's
just convenient to have a spray bronzer
then again I don't know it's probably
will transfer on your clothes of course
I don't know that yet speaking of
clothes I feel like it's not all over my
black top which is nice you can
definitely feel when you spray it like
where it's going on your face so you're
kind of nervous at first but once you
feel where it's spraying at you'll feel
like it's like a cooling sensation then
you'll know kind of where to apply your
bronzer and everything I would recommend
this to someone who likes cool things
like this if you like Spray products
like spray foundations whatever I would
totally recommend it I think it'd be
cool I don't know if it's like super
easy but it's very cool I like it I'm
gonna continue to use them up you know
that's another thing I'll probably use
this bronzer up in a minute I mean it
already feels much lighter than the
blush but I feel like I'll use this up
within like 4 times of using it but I'm
going to try to just use it for my neck
and my chest but it did give a beautiful
bronze natural tan to my face so I
definitely think they do what they say
they're really cool they're only $12.99
so I mean if you want to just go and try
it out I think it's definitely worth it
it's fun and it's just something
different to try that is it for this
video let me know in the comments what
you guys think would you test this out
would you not are you surprised that it
didn't get everywhere cuz I'm surprised
I'm very surprised thank you guys so

next video bye
