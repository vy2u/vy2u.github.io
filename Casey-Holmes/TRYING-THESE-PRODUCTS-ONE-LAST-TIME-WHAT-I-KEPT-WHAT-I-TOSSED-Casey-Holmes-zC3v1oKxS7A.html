to be trying out some makeup products
that I'm not sure if I like them or not
in this video is going to help me
determine whether I like them or if I
don't because I've tried them out a
couple times and I'm just not there I
can't I don't know if I like them so I
figured I would try them again one more
time on camera and we'll just see
together if I can make it work
so this be cool video idea it's not
necessarily first impressions it's not
necessarily products and it worked for
me it's like right there in the middle
trying to figure it out and see if I
like it or not so it's got some popular
items in here I've been keeping
everything in this little box if you
like this idea definitely give the video
a thumbs up so I know to compile all the
products I'm not sure about into a box
hold it off for another video for you
guys and don't forget to subscribe
before you leave and let us go ahead and
get started okay so we're going to go
ahead and put our hair or my hair back
I'm going to put my hair back do have a
self culture palette and still trying it
out I am trying hard to make it work I'm
thinking I'm going to be one of those
people that just can't make it work I
have tried I love the colors I just get
frustrated every time I use it like I
don't have a problem with the fallout
anything like that I mean yes it's a lot
but obviously you're supposed to go in
with a light hand you know when you're
tapping the product but my thing is I
just can't get them to blend like I want
them to blend John is pretty easy to
blend out new wave edge those are pretty
easy to blend out but then when you get
into the darker colors like all star was
hard for me it was hard I think that's
what broke my last look and then I tried
to do another look and use fudge and it
was just a difficult process for me zoom
you guys in we're going to try out
another look I'm giving this a fair shot
I know novena came out with a statement
and I believe they're just pressed
differently I can't remember top of my
head but there's a reason why they're
different and I even play with my modern
renaissance palette the other day and
modern renaissance has quite a bit of
Fallout 2 let's be real so I'm going to
set my eyes of the translucent powder
again because I don't like to set my lid
with dawn I find that it's too dark
I prefer that actually as a transition
shade so I'm just going to fluff this
all over make sure my primer is really
really set
so now I'm going to go in with Don just
taking this morphe brush and I'm going
to blend this into the crease need a
good transition shade this one does
blend pretty well I don't mind this as a
transition shade like I've been on the
fence about returning this because a
couple of the shades I really do like
and they work for me but when I get to
the deeper shades when I get really
excited to you know smoke out a look I
end up messing it up I mean all I'm
doing is just tapping my brush in there
and that's how much I'm getting off but
not the world I feel like that's kind of
an obvious one with this palette look
how pretty that is like that's such a
pretty transition color I was like
perfect for me we're going to make this
work I'm damned determined I'm going to
go on with new ways again right here I'm
going to go in with new ways and I'm
going to throw this right below that
transition shade I love this color I
love this one and edge I think they are
so cool I'm so different which is right
in there barely tap them and I have
color from inner to outer corner so
first this but press the brush in a
couple times and that's what it looks
like it's not bad at all I haven't used
the shade yet and I'm just going to
open this in here on tool is I'm using
very very light pressure I'm going to
take another blending brush I'm going to
go back in with new wave and again try
to blend this edge let's make it look a
little less noticeable very lightly
putting pressure in the crease and go
back in with whatever is leftover on
this brush and try to really blend out
the edge the dip in one last time just
does little tippy-tap work from the
lower lash line up so now I'm going to
take rowdy which is this deep purple
right here and I think I just want to
put this in the very outer V do this on
first just to deepen it up kind of act
as like a black again one small tap and
I'm going small strokes very lightly
okay look at that like you see that's
like
go back in with that shade that we used
with untamed and try to just blend this
little choppy part right here I didn't
put any extra product on here I'm just
using the brush and whatever is left on
there and lightly blending it out do you
guys see in here where it's just getting
patchy and not working for me I just
find that I have a very hard time with
this palette I think it's beautiful and
I think some people have created really
beautiful looks with this palette and
trust me if you like it that's good I'm
glad you like it because you set your
money on something that you really do
enjoy but for me I just find it
difficult to work with and even though
this is coming out way better than it
did I just feel like I spend so much
time just working with it okay so now
I'm going to go with a flat shader brush
I'm going to use my mac 242 this is what
I like to use to pack color on so now
I'm going to go in with the shade adorn
I don't think I've used this
actually I think I used to actually the
other day in a video you guys didn't see
me apply it the idea of our makeup look
I'm just going to put this right in the
inner part
like so this one has quite a bit of kick
of but okay I'm going to try to use this
to help blend that line
this one has fall outs where I can kind
of feel it going in my eye so just FYI
you know when you get to a certain place
in your eye makeup and you're like I
don't know if I want to keep going
because I might mess it up I'm kind of
there so I think I think I'm going to
stop here I do think it's pretty I just
I don't know man I can't I'm not trying
to go with the crowd and say oh it's
awful because it's not awful like I said
there's a few shades in here that I
really love just can't get the whole
palette to work for me okay so next up
we have this Too Faced hangover 3 &amp;amp; 1
replenishing primer and setting spray I
just haven't been a big fan of it this
it's such an impressive spray these
looks good should musn't but we're just
going to try that again we're going to
use this in place of the Smashbox primer
water and we're going to use the Canaan
Austin one on top it's just not a super
fine mist like like this one but I mean
it still feels good so I have tried two
different drugstore primers out and
quickly wanted to mention them to you
because I don't want to use them today
with the foundation just to things I
want to give the foundation a fair shot
again but I have to say I used this one
it with the YSL foundation the other day
actually used it in a video
and throughout the day this was awful
this made my foundation break up it made
it slide I was extra shiny not impressed
by this this is new Jade cat beauty
mattifying face primer it's just it's
not for oily seeing okay do this that
looks like oil that's going to be
sitting on your skin which it will be
not a fan at all of it I feel like it
just doesn't sink into the skin doesn't
blur out your pores doesn't really
matter Phi well at all so then we have
the NYX no filter blurring primer which
I totally thought would be a dupe for my
Kane and Austin primer it's just
different it's got a different texture
it doesn't really blur out my pores very
well it's just not there and it doesn't
keep me matte either so look this is the
next one right now let me show you the
Canaan Austin one since the Cantor
Austin one it is a super expensive
primer I totally get it
but the formula is just there's like
more of a moosie consistency so this is
canon austin this is Nick's
if use a difference like this is
supposed to be blurring primer this was
supposed to be mattifying right here and
then this one is like amazing I mean it
does have a tint to it as you can see
but it blurs everything out is that
moosie consistency so if you're dry I
would stay away from this but it's the
best I would not recommend those primers
if you have very oily skins they're
going to make your makeup break up okay
I feel like primers are so important and
sometimes we don't think about the
primer could be the cause of our
foundation breaking up so that's why I
like to use my regular primers when I'm
trying new foundations for the most part
because I want to really give it a fair
shot
but this sprays like to face is not
really going to make a difference
they're going to apply the canon austin
one this is the one that matters most
because it's the one that helps control
my oils this stays in my t-zone then we
have a few foundations that I am
questioning do you have these Sephora
stick foundations this is in the shade
maple there's a foundation and concealer
sticks so I got to use a little while
ago I actually tried to film a video
with them and I hated it so much I quit
filming the video as well as this first
debut detection intense bad I also have
the milk makeup one but I did a full
video using that so I'm just going to
keep that same to the side and we're
just going to go ahead and play with
these again I found that these are
really cakey they didn't make my skin
look really beautiful when I tried it
last I don't know just wasn't my
favorite so I have the shade bamboo
which looks like that
I think bamboos just too yellow for me
and then we have maple so I'm going to
try the maple again today I love the
hourglass vanished a foundation I think
it's beautiful
we're going to try this again so I am
just going to use a flat top brush with
it
heavy
like do you see how it's sighs my pores
are there in my texture yes it covers
some but you can also see some eye
redness peeking through so I would
always just add a little bit more in
those areas and to me looks cakey like I
said I'm trying to give these products a
fair shot but every time I apply them
I'm just like oh gosh not pretty on the
skin it's not as full coverage as like
the hourglass one hourglass one I find
is definitely multiple coverage look at
it oh my god
so I don't know if you can tell on
camera but it's just kind of like
breaking up in this area it is attaching
to any texture especially here in the
center of my nose it doesn't do anything
for my pores over here do you see it
just looks cakey my chin she's not cute
you definitely need some concealer on
because I am a dark today it was like I
had no sleep I did have some sleep so uh
my wife wasn't like that but I'm going
to use the Dior forever undercover
concealer I'm on the fence about this
because I just don't feel like it's
worth the money feel like to me it kind
of looks like a drugstore concealer but
just be me we're going to do one side it
kind of stings the skin as well this is
more of in my opinion like a medium
concealer it's not terrible but it does
kind of burn my skin and my eyes and
it's just it's I don't know it's doing
that thing that some concealers do where
it is trying to cover but it's not so
you can still kind of see the darkness
here and you can see my skin tone right
in here so it's like light a line and
then my skin I don't think you can see
it on camera that well but it kind of in
person just looks like Oh cast like a
grey kind of cast and since it's more
that medium coverage is just not
covering and it doesn't look seamless
that's why I've been on the fence about
this concealer I mean the formula is 9
blends out really well and it looks like
skin but I think if you're wanting like
more of a full full coverage concealer I
would pass on it I just like a full
coverage concealer you know I'm saying I
need it to be intense but intense on the
first go around so let's see if we can
build this up okay you can build it up
give it that my eyes like starting to
water okay that looks better you can
build it up but I still see quite a bit
of skin right here like this little
sizzle line like from far away it looks
okay up close like girl like you can see
my skin peeking through here maybe for
like everyday concealer this would be
nice but I'm not I wouldn't spend this
much money on everyday concealer you
could find one at the drugstore but it
did brighten
I mean it's not a bad concealer I just
and I had different expectations for how
because it was so expensive that I
thought I would be in love with it not
how much is this concealer
it's $34 $34.95 it until lid so and then
I'm going to take my two phases to right
brush oh we're just gonna set the rest
it has a really pretty finish my nose
right now is I'm gonna puke you see it's
starting to break up right in here
that's mainly like the foundation kind
of concealer combo that's doing that the
powder looks really good I give it that
it looks beautiful I'm just not sure of
the longevity
okay this is start a crease now alright
let's try to fix that so next up we have
this heavy bronzer I don't know why this
compact is so heavy but it's a couple
pounds pretty heavy but it's the Lila B
B sunkissed bronze beauty and they only
have this shade from what I'm looking at
online the packaging just slides open
like that you do not get a mirror hear
that that's why it's so heavy and then
you have the bronzer so it says the
multi-purpose bronzer to highlight
contour or blend for a sunkissed glow
with a swipe of this multi-purpose
bronzer duo you'll have an instant
sunkissed glow highlight with the
largest shade contour and define with
the darker shade or combine the two for
natural-looking radiance so we're going
to try this out a few different ways
again so what I do when I first use it
is I just swirl them all together and
bronze to my space so we're going to do
that on one side I don't know what it
was but about like I think what was
throwing me off about this product was
the packaging
I just wasn't obsessed with it but it
does look nice I mean it gives a really
intense bronzed look so I'm just going
to split that out so it blends out
pretty well I do like the color it's
more of like a natural tan color so I am
on the other side can take a little bit
less to bronze this is $42 by the way it
says highlight with the lightest shade
contour defined with the darkest okay so
I'm going to contour define with this
one this is a pure cosmetics brush from
like the neutrals liner sticks
we're just going to contour tonight nice
contour oh I mean I feel like that's
blending out well I am using a very tiny
brush I think that looks really good it
is more of like a warm toned bronzer but
I really like it I'm going to go in with
a highlight brush and use my on stasi of
one and I'm going to use this one this
is why I don't ever do the duo's
and then put on my face yes no I would
just mix this all together and bronze or
to use a darker shade to contour I give
it a thumbs up I think it's great again
it is kind of heavy so just be warned
okay so I just did my brows I have
lashes on left I used where valeurs doll
me up now let's go back into subculture
palette and smoke up this lower lash
line so I'm going to take the shade
untamed again with a flat brush and boy
presses up against that lower lash line
now we're going to take a pencil brush
and we're just going to use the color
gone right here to blend that out any
bellows okay blend it out smoked out
this look turned out a lot better than
the very first look that I did and I
definitely just think if you're going to
buy this palette just no going to have
to really work with it you're not really
into makeup and you're not willing to
put the time into blending it and really
trying to find the colors that work well
together then I would say pass on it
I've been using glosses quite a bit
lately so I was really excited to test
this out this Too Too Faced melted it
latex lip color so what I'm using today
is peekaboo I forget what shade that I
used the other day it was telling this
one right here actually it was the shade
hopeless romantic creatures but when I
tried out in this video and I didn't
really update you guys on how I felt
about it which I apologize I completely
forgot about it
I wore this for probably an hour and I
just got so irritated wearing it because
it would constantly get on my lips like
I mean I wear glosses quite a bit right
now and they don't always get on my
teeth like this is this case on your
teeth and you really have to scrub to
get it off just because it's such a sick
gloss hit the latex part and it just
wants to stay on but it gets all over
your teeth I am a paranoid girl when it
comes to stuffing all my teeth slip
price anything I'm always like anybody
I'm around the other tell me does all my
teeth anyways that's the problem
I just can't seem to get them to want to
stay in this one area they just want to
get on my teeth or on the outer parts of
my mouth I'm going to try this again and
I'll let you know down below and pin
comment what I think this I mean the
shades are beautiful and have so many
pre shades they also have a clear shade
you could put on top of a matte lip
which I thought it was really really
cool and it's just a really thick gloss
so committed I mean they're beautiful
here and just me as a dick gloss if your
husband or boyfriend hates lip gloss and
he pisses you off one day wear this and
give them because it won't come off very
very pigmented but I don't know it's not
practical for me so far but I think it
is so pretty I mean it's so shiny so
glossy I've been really loving the new
huda beauty strobe glosses I wore that
in my products I didn't work out for me
video and a ton of you are like what is
on your lips and I know it's so gorgeous
that was the only thing on my lips I
loved that call it Mia throughout the
day if I smile or something I find that
these get on my teeth to get like right
on here but I'm on the fence about it
like I love the color
I think it's a cool concept of having
like a liquid glossy lip that like stays
on I just have a problem with it kind of
looking a little messy some time going
to go ahead and just let you know the
rest of the products already kind of
told you about this just few minutes ago
we Sephora foundation stick I'm going to
say the path for me even looking at my
face up close I can see where it's just
breaking up and it's just not that
flattering on my skin it emphasizes some
texture I prefer other foundations over
this one even the hourglass one I think
it's way better this Dior forever under
cover concealer is okay it is not bad I
will continue to use it and mix it with
my Tarte one simply because I spent a
lot of money on it and I you know I need
to use it
oh those gross next up is the Too Faced
Born This Way powder actually really
liked it the more I use it I really like
it it's just the longevity of it oh here
we go
it's just the longevity of it I'm not
really impressed with I just find that
sometimes it gives a little heavy
looking throughout the day if I'm not
care
about 85% liking it I will keep you guys
updated my hips and misses and let you
know but I mean the finish like right
now it is nice even though the
foundation is not working for me the
powder doesn't look heavy or anything it
just set the product and I still have
some glow to my skin which is nice so I
still think this is nice I love the Born
This Way line I love the concealer the
foundation and I think it's cool that it
came out with a powder the - same
hangover three one replenishing primer
and setting spray first of all I don't
really use stuff like this for setting
sprays I don't really believe in setting
sprays believe it or not I find that I'm
a male is worse but this was nice as
like a primer with a cane and Austin
primer as well I like the smell of it I
just don't like to spray too much I like
the spray is just a little bit more
aggressive than the Smashbox one but it
is nice I recommend trying it out if
you're into stuff like this I mean it
does summer really good smell and the
packaging is super cute so that is it
for this video you guys let me know down
below in the comments what you think of
these products if you try them out
I've always wanting to hear your
opinions on them thank you guys so much
for watching and I will see you guys in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
