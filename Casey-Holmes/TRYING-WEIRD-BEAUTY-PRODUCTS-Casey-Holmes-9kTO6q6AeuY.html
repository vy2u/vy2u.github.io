out some weird of beauty products the
things I have not tried out on camera
before I'm just some different things
that you know I wanted to try out for
you guys and see if it was cool if it
works all of that so if you are
interested in seeing all these products
in action and seeing if they work then
just keep watching and also don't forget
to subscribe before you leave and also
hit that thumbs up button if you like it
as well so yeah if you want to see all
of these products tested then let's go
ahead and get started all right the
first thing I'm so excited to try
I bought this online I'm pretty sure
this wasn't that expensive I'll put the
price right here but this is the
Charlotte Tilbury new instant magic
facial dry sheet mask I do not know why
I read it like the had success expert
facialist results in just 15 minutes and
I think it's really cool because she did
include this into the package that I
purchased so it's just a how-to
basically with pictures which I like
pictures you know I don't like to read
directions but if it has pictures I will
look at it so it says this next
generation mask is clinically proven to
hydrate list brighten the complexion
while decreasing wrinkles and smoothing
skin over time the mask uses
revolutionary biomedic delivery system
and the highest potency ingredient stays
dry on your skin so you can mask on the
go I don't know why I'm goin with this
kind of mask on but for the first
release effects of this mask left up for
eight hours one mask equals 3 uses wow
the instant Hollywood celebrity facial
effect alright it says instant so very
good just let me go ahead and test this
out so it comes in a package like this
very very pretty and she's gonna put
lotion on my hand so so it does have a
seal on the top
I guess that's so you could put the mask
back into it
so this first unfold your dry sheet mask
place the p-side on to cleansed skin so
just looks like this it literally is
just a dry sheet mask very weird so my
face is cleansed and we're ready to go
and I'm just going to take the pink side
this is weird
whose top and bottom hooks over the ears
positioning the mask comfortably over
the face oh okay
it kind of feels cooling like not really
cooling like you probably think Oh both
these go over your ears this is really
scary
gently massage on top to activate your
dry mask mask stays dry and drip free I
feel like it's not I don't know why but
mine is not like sitting here on my nose
like I wish it was
I guess it's I don't know I feel like
it's missing a whole area right here
that's just because it is pulled back on
my skin I like that stays on your face I
feel like if wet mess has the ear thing
I really love it but then again like I
said I feel like it's not getting right
here we're just only this on 15 minutes
starts I don't even know is people like
this I've seen people try it but I
haven't actually like watch their review
well let me know if you've tried it and
if you like it because I'm very
skeptical okay so it's been 15 minutes
what do I do after that
Vasudha it says instant Hollywood
celebrity facial effect I don't know
about all that but we'll see
I mean there's some product on my face
maybe it's my oil I don't know um it is
cool like I mean you can obviously see
there's product in my face and I can
feel it as well but I don't know if I
like the feeling of a dry mask on my
face right to my list in the merit it
look like I was robbing my own house I
think it's great for convenience I don't
know how sanitary it is to use it over
and over again but I guess it's okay
since you can use it three times
not my favorite mask I am going to keep
it and try it maybe a couple more times
but I was able to do laundry while doing
a mask so that's pretty cool so far
copy this it works there's like a glow
to my skin um I don't know if I'm
obsessed with it okay so next time we're
going to try this product out that I
have seen everywhere it might not be
this exact product but I see a lot of
people do like DIYs with it and just
like Facebook Instagram videos where I'm
just like what the hell is in your mouth
I just I'd try it out for myself this is
the squeaky clean teeth whitening powder
now we're just going to see like if this
has a taste if it's uncomfortable we're
probably not going to see right away
it's completely brightened up like in an
instant
it does say once you're done your smile
will be white sparkling and squeaky
clean so there's all my chance it's like
hmm so this is the squeaky clean teeth
whitening powder and it says it's a
hundred percent natural if they ever
wanted to know what you'd look like with
no teeth well for okay sorry I was
reading them in my mind and I was
starting to ass ever wanted to know what
you look like with no teeth well for a
brief few moments you can finally care
of your curiosity that's right when you
brush your teeth are great jet black
powder full of activated charcoal you'll
closely resemble grainy without her
false teeth
we know totally hot right but while
you're busy looking like a toothless
pirate you'll actually be polishing
those pearly whites as well as
eliminating toxins and bacteria from
your teeth and mouth is strengthening
your gums you won't be able to wipe the
smile off your face when you're done so
this sounds pretty instant according to
this box
I got this off my Amazon Amazon is where
I've been like hiding
shortly so creepin on their life so it
looks like I'll put the price up here as
well I'll put the price up here for
pretty much everything because some of
the stuff I've had for a while this is
the packaging very nice and sleek and on
the inside you do have this little
packet there's directions on the box it
says to clean your toothbrush with some
water and dip it into your tub of
squeaky clean
gently brush in circular motions across
the teeth for two minutes remember to
keep your lips closed while brushing
carefully spit out as much as you can
and rinse thoroughly keep smiling
see what this baby looks like it's in
there you can't really see it but it's
in there it's like the same color as the
tube okay so I wet my brush I'm just
going to dip it in here oh right out for
two minutes okay so let me set a timer
we're gonna do this for two whole
minutes go mmm this is scary
oh my god okay so I'm going to basically
show you guys what's going on
so it's like in my downs right now and I
can't get it out so wish me luck you
know I'm going to try to brush my teeth
with my toothpaste in a new toothbrush
and I feel like my gums are hurting I'll
be right back okay so this is what my
teeth look like now they're looking a
little wider I think I don't know what
you guys think that was terrifying
I probably should have done it because
my engagement shoot is tomorrow and if
that would have been like a really bad
turnout it was not as easy to spit out
as I thought it would be I don't think
I'll try this again unless like I'll
have to do the next day or a few
days after the let me know have you guys
try this what do you think and how do
you think my teeth look so now I'm going
to try this panda's dream cool I stick I
don't know this is it really weird it's
just something cute and I want to try it
and another Amazon find this is what
that looks like it's so cute don't make
it like perfumes or something like this
I don't know but it's a cool eye stick
oh yeah so I'm just going to open this
up it has like a fresh scent to it
nothing crazy
woo okay so this reminds me of the milk
makeup stick but this one's way creamier
than the milk one or it's like more
moisturizing I should say does feel
really nice and cooling I love that it
glides on after you warm it up it really
does glide on the skin a lot smoother
than the milk makeup one whoo I like
that
I'm just going to tap it in its gonna be
really good base for the concealer and
foundation I like it this is the last
thing I'm going to test out for you guys
I've been nervous to try it but this is
the finishing touch instant and
pain-free hair remover you guys remember
the last time I made Davis try a
painless wax it didn't go very well I'm
very skeptical on the pain-free part
which is why I thought I would do it in
this video because you know figured out
was you know let Davis off the hook for
this one and I would try it since we
waxed him last time open this up it says
no soap no water no cream no Nick's no
cuts no bumps just say yes to instant
and painless hair removal introducing
the world's first full body hair remover
made just for women to feel clean and
sexy all over it includes trimmer head
smooth micro foil hag recharge while VCM
ion battery USB wall charger and a
cleaning brush so you get this little
guys in here which I guess has all your
knickknacks
the cleaning brush the charger and
probably have to charge this and then
here is the product yeah please charge
completely before first use and it says
2.5 hours so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to charge this and then I'll come
back I'm actually going to film another
video so I'll charge this you will try
it out together so I will see you guys
in just a few hours okay so it's a few
days later
this really needed some time to charge
now just kidding I caught up with
something so I figured I'll wrap this
video up and go ahead and try this out
for you don't mind my makeup right now I
just did a first impressions and take go
smooth as I thought I'm going to go
ahead and test this out so you have a
QuickStart guide right here and then
they have a thank-you card saying thanks
for choosing us please follow these
simple steps and begin eliminating
unwanted hair so number one says to
charge it completely which I did do to
make sure your skin is clean and dry
turn to switch to on purple touch
activated light in green LED will flash
okay
then it says position trimmer head
against the skin to begin removal touch
activated light will automatically turn
on when in use okay I'm going to do my
arm because it's easiest look excuse me
okay
you have two little things in here you
have the micro coil head and then you
have this brush cleaner I'm going to
take the micro coil out to up what got
it now I'm going to put the micro coil
head on top these things scare me I
think don't like guys shavers have this
like an it freaks me out
okay so God is on and it says to you
that at a 90-degree angle not a 45 so
it's like straight up does it really
hurt then so what is that literally all
this thing does I mean like yeah it's
nice and smooth but so I thought wrong
about this product the whole entire time
I thought this is going to be like a
mini laser thing you know how some
people on the market have like lasers
that you can do at home but that is not
this this is just literally a hair
remover and it does work since you can
use on your face it doesn't hurt it does
remove the hair it's really nice and
smooth so I mean it works but it's not
what I thought it was so maybe I should
read stuff next time so that is all that
I have for you guys today for this video
I really hope you guys enjoyed it let me
know down below in the comments if you
tried any of this stuff out if you swear
by any of it also for the teeth charcoal
crap let me know what you think and let
me know if I do did anything wrong or if
I'm doing it right and I'm just freaking
myself out over it because I had
charcoal stuff through my gums for a day
