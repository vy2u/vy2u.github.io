today I'm going to be sharing with you
this makeup look we're going to do a
talk through get ready with me so we're
going to just try some new makeup put on
some old favourites and talk about
what's been going on this past week
since a lot of you know I did get
engaged and all I do you want to know
how what happened so don't forget to
subscribe before you leave it's right
here also if you liked the video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up and if you
want to see how to get this makeup look
then let's just go ahead and get started
okay so I just primed my eyes I don't
know how this lighting looks on my face
let me know what you think like
everything is shining in my face right
now but I got this new light in you can
see and it's really cool it's ginormous
so I figure to be great for tutorials
and the license are so bright I mainly
got it for traveling but I want to see
how it looks right now like if you like
this let me know if you like it off so
no I think I like it off I think I like
it all it is 526 on a Thursday and I
need to film this edit it and do it up
by it's nice because I haven't put up a
video in a week and if you follow me on
my Instagram any of my social media you
would know that I got engaged over the
weekend
so just in celebrating recovering and
also just getting some other things done
and that's like another reason why I'm
filming so Lai's because I've been
running errands all day today and this
is like the only time I had to sit down
and film so I was like you know what
we're just going to do it we're going to
wing it out so I'm going to go ahead and
get started and I'm gonna let guys know
about the engagement well on my
Ringelmann and all that other kind of
stuff which you follow me on social
media you probably already know and I
also got these at Walmart these are
shadow shields and I wanted to try them
out because you guys know I use tape but
this is supposed to be like my tape you
know just a little bit better so I'm
going to try these out today and see if
I like them but it just come like this
with some stickers on the back these
things are super sticky I know some
people only use like the top layer but
I'm going all out you know what I mean I
don't want this thing budgin don't want
it going nowhere so I did purchasing
more feet in size for the 35o matte
palette and
when I miss for a while I do have the
original 3 500 palette that I purchased
and then I was like you know what I
think I was on a Facebook line and
someone told me that I should try this
out and I was like you know whatever
they should cuz I threw out that they
have this so I'm going to be playing
with this today I'm going to go in with
this one right here and I'm going to put
this all over my lid and I have already
primed I use my NARS eyes shadow primer
so going into talking about the
engagement a lot of people are asking if
we videoed it and we did not you know
I'm kind of glad that you didn't get on
video just because it was a really
private moment for us and it was really
special in the ways that he proposed you
wouldn't be able to hear anything I
don't think so yeah we did not film it
but it was so special um basically what
happened was we went in to Atlanta for
the weekend because Davis is starting a
different school this next week and
we're not going to be able to like go
out and do much we were like alright
let's go to Atlanta let's have some fun
we went into Atlanta on Friday we saw
Beauty and the Beast which is great by
the way I really loved Beauty and the
Beast kind of just hung out after that
movie it was like so late Susan go out
and we were like okay well we'll go out
tomorrow blah blah blah we slept in the
next morning we're supposed to go to a
massage appointment but when you put me
on the side of the alarm
I normally turn it off so I try to ruin
that part I made us miss our massage
appointment but anyways we ended up
waking up and he was like okay well
let's go have lunch at this Park Tavern
place it's like a like I guess like a
bar and grill type thing so I was I
don't very cool because I'm always down
to try new barn grills and just fun
things we got there we got it uber but
he drops us off as I was complete
opposite end which I guess Davis wanted
because on the other end it would have
been harder for me to walk to where we
were going to for him to propose as we
were walking through I was like oh my
gosh where is this place at like we're
sitting here walking forever it really
wasn't that far I just had heels on and
I knew people were looking at me weird
but I mean I didn't really care about
that I was just like okay my feet are
going to be killing me if we don't get
to this place we walk free walk and then
we get to this one area where it is just
so pretty it's a pretty view of Atlanta
and I was like okay hold on I want to
take a picture real quick like a
snapchat and you follow my snapchat you
kind of see
how it all unfold and so I took a
snapchat and then we went around the
corner and he was like well let's go
down here and take a picture too because
you know I feel like we always take
pictures so it was super normal I didn't
really think anything of it I was just
like okay whatever so we went down there
so the couple pictures just took a
double minutes to because I was like no
I don't like that one was over he said
he was freaking out because as I was
walking going he's like no no no no no
like everybody set up in place or
whatever he got me one arm he was like
no you don't want me to do this in front
of people and I was like you are not
doing this right now
dude there's people behind us and
everything but we were the only ones
down there but yeah he was like I know
you want me to do this in front of
people and I just like started to freak
out I was like no way he was like I know
you want me to do it right now right
here from everyone's butt and then I
kind of just blacked out I don't even
remember what he said I just remember
him asking me if I would marry him else
I really don't remember he says some
other things before he asked me to marry
him but I just can't remember it if you
ask him he doesn't remember either it's
just one of those things where we were
both like oh my gosh like nervous and
then whenever he asked me I said yes and
I was like following my eyes out and I
have wings liner on which I do not
recommend if you know you're gonna get
engaged don't wear winged eyeliner
because my island was just running
everywhere my wing was gone
by the end of me like you know trying to
wipe away all these black smudges yeah
that's basically how it went I didn't
know he was going to do it I was really
shocked I mean I knew one day we were
going to get married but I didn't know
he was going to ask me to marry him
right then it was really special and
then once he asked me to marry him he
told me that everybody was set up like
his parents were over in this corner and
my mom and our best friends were over
here and we had the camera guy which we
had a lot of pictures taken and they
turned out so well but yeah so everybody
was just set up and then when they came
around the corner now when we were
walking to this tavern place I was like
oh I missed my dogs I wish they were
here desert illiterate uh because I was
just talking about how much I missed the
pups because I'm sickly obsessed with my
dogs like I if I leave them at home even
if I'm in it
I miss them like crazy and then they
come around the corner with these
adorable little signs on them that said
daddy asked mom you said yes and I was
like oh I got a job there and it was
just perfect I mean the whole day was
absolutely perfect and it was so much
fun and then we ended up actually going
to eat at that Park Tavern and it's
delicious by the way if you're ever in
Atlanta I highly recommend it it was
amazing thank you guys so much for all
the sweet words on my Instagram post and
everything on my Twitter it's been
incredible and I cannot wait to share
this next chapter with you guys I'm
actually going to be vlogging like my
wedding planning and stuff I'm actually
hiring a planner because as you guys
know I'm going to be moving and I I
don't see myself wanting to have a lot
of control of course man I have a lot of
control over you know what's going to
happen and all of that but like actually
scheduling everything and putting
everything in place I wanted a planner
for that just so I didn't have to worry
about it especially being so far away so
I'm going to vlog that I have a few
venues in mind going to see one next
week that is like my dream venue but
like I don't want to say where it is I
want to be a surprise for you guys to
see it whenever we do have a wedding and
have a wedding video I wanted to be a
surprise but it looks so beautiful
and I cannot wait to go see it next week
I think it's just going to be a dream
the only damn nervous about is like if
it rains which a lot of people are like
you shouldn't worry about but I'm so
scared for it to rain I don't know it's
like making me want to hold back on
certain venues because I'm like what if
it rains like we won't we don't have a
choice we don't have anywhere to go let
me don't have any tips when it comes to
stuff like that down below I mean my
wedding planner is probably gonna let me
know but it makes me real nervous okay
it's been a really great week weekend
all the above and I'm just so excited
and grateful I actually went out today
and bought like all of my bridesmaids
maid of honor stuff to put together have
some things coming in the mail for that
so I'm going to record me putting all
that stuff together all this is going to
go on my blog channel by the way I'm
going to record me putting all that
together and everything
but I won't upload it until I actually
give it to the girl what's been
happening and then I'll post a little
video right now over me showing you guys
the ring I actually try filming a video
when was I think was Monday but it
didn't end up going hi plan at
completely reviewed the wrong product so
I just had to skip out on uploading it
that was my first video with my ring so
I showed it to you guys in that video
but I'll put it overlay right in here so
you guys can see but we have to send my
ring off to get resized so that's where
it's at right now I won't have it until
about April 12th through 18 kinda bummed
about it once you told me April 12th or
18th I was like what girl that one I
can't I know I'm sorry I was just like
oh my gosh that's literally so long from
now but it'll be alright
and well I've had so many questions
asking if I'm going to vlog it and
everything like the process and all of
that and I definitely am just because I
think will be a lot of fun but I'm only
going to vlog like what I can because
there's not going to be no too much to
show you guys until the actual wedding
day which I plan on having like a
wedding video and all of that for you
guys so you can see what happened and
like it's kind of like you guys are
invited as well I'm trying to think of
anything else other than that that's
been going on I think that's pretty much
the only thing that's been going on and
that's different everything else is
pretty much the same it's been super
busy trying to get everything in order
I'm also trying to you know get ready to
move because we move in like a month
month and a half which I don't know how
to prepare for I appreciate you guys
being patient with me because normally I
have a really good uploading schedule
but this week it's just been gone
haven't had 1k so that's the matte
eyeshadow look I actually really like I
think it's kind of cool a little bit of
a halo eye in there so now I'm going to
go ahead and take this off probably
clean up a little bit but that's not bad
now I'm going to do is I'm going to take
a liner I'm just going to use this
flower beauty ones that I showed in
I think my last video this is the liquid
liner from flower beauty in black and
this does dry mask and it has a felt tip
on it I'm just going to line my eyes I'm
not going to do anything crazy also I'm
going to tell you guys today is the day
that my palettes are launching in
Sephora I'm so excited about it they're
finally in stores or no wait I'm in Ulta
today's the day that the palettes are
available at Ulta in stores very excited
so now they're available pretty much
anywhere in store and online I'm so
definitely go check them out
again thank you guys so much for all the
love I've been seeing all your pictures
and I've been trying to like all of them
I'm going to go in with the Smashbox
primer water I'm so hot right now in
this room with all these lights and this
minute feels so good it's finally
starting to feel like spring here we're
even going to the lake this weekend I'm
so excited because we just put the
weight tower up on our boat and I am
just like so excited to go out and like
hopefully wakeboarding will be a little
bit easier now there's a rope tire and
not like dragging in the water so I'm
going to go on to the bow shop or
Festing white charcoal mattifying
treatment primer don't know how to go
about this just yet that'll keep you
updated also I've been using the new
Tarte self-tanner and I've had a ton of
questions from you guys asking me if I
like it or not I do like it I will say I
don't think it lasts as long and loving
pan but I really do like it and I feel
like it's easier to get all I was
nervous when I first applied it that is
going to be too streaky but it's just
the color guard that gets really streaky
just make sure you really blend quickly
because it does drive pretty fast I
think a little bit faster than loving
tan and I don't know if it's just my
bottle but the pump that I have is not
that great it doesn't really foam up
well so just keep that in mind but I do
think it's a really great self tanner
it's really nice and dark I've had
compliments on people saying that looks
like I came back from the beach
I didn't look orange so that's pretty
great I mean nobody's ever told me I
look orange with the loving tan but
everybody's been complimenting that tart
one so in mustika and let's take a group
and I'm going to take this precision
precision Beauty soup pack original and
vitamin E infused blender sponge I'm
going to take just the original one
and we're going to use this today
because I'm going to use the wet and
wild photo focus foundation I feel like
I'm yelling at you guys I'm so sorry
some ant I haven't so they're so long I
really good about what everyone alright
so got nice and squishy and like I said
I'm going to go in with you wet and wild
photo focus foundation I was going to
use the SI water double wear which I
really do like that foundation but y'all
I wore it the other night going out with
friends
ok was like a couple weekends ago we
took pictures and one picture was posted
in the flashback on that foundation was
awful all fall I use that foundation in
my engagement photos look beautiful the
holy if I use flash no I would only
use that foundation if you're not going
to take photos because I was like oh my
god I'm so embarrassed I look like I
literally have no idea what I'm doing
when they go this is me wet and wild so
I focused in desert beige and I don't
know what happened to my top but I broke
it now but I'm just going to ahead and
blend that out with this sponge we're
going to match my oh wow this is this is
really dark hold on I'm going to go in
with a little bit of golden beige and
we're just going to lighten this up just
a little bit also the Ecotools sponges I
do like them but again if you're going
to use it for like foundation or
something I would go with the L'Oreal
one and I just think it's really really
nice I just can't seem to get away from
that bunch it's just so good and it sets
a bar up for everybody else all right so
we've got lashes on and wait for those
to dry and then we'll go in and clean
everything up and now I'm going to go
ahead and take concealer I'm just going
to use my trusty old high-end ones these
are the Tarte shape tape and the Urban
Decay Naked skin I've recently been
using the Naked skin as opposed to some
other ones just because I forgot all
about it and I was cleaning out doors
and I found it and I was like oh my gosh
I used to love this I'm kind of back
into it now it's just a really nice
natural looking concealer it looks great
with light coverage foundations you know
full coverage foundation I just really
like it so this one is the shade like
neutral and the Tarte one is
light/medium I'm just going to use it to
hopefully lighten up my day I don't
think we need the bronze today
I don't think we need the bronze a lot
of people are asking me so I'm going to
do my makeup for the wedding and I
probably will I might have a few trial
runs with people I'll ask if they would
do it and just like let me see what you
know they can do but I feel like when
you do hear make up for so long you just
know what you like and I'm so scared
that like I don't know I guess it's just
why you have trial runs and just so
scared that on the day of I'm going to
be like no I don't like it you know what
I mean I'd rather be in control of my
makeup but we'll see we'll see what
happens you know I don't know there's a
lot of talented artists out there and
I'm totally down to see if you know I
can relax on my big day and have someone
else do my makeup or if I just want to
do it we'll see if you have any
recommendations really great makeup
artist let me know their instagrams down
below if I have one in mind that it's
friends with my hairstylist so I'm going
to contact her and see if I can do a
trial run with her and then I'm looking
for a couple other ones so I'm going to
take the LA girl Pro HD setting powder
and banana yellow I'm going to set
everything with this I really like this
powder lightly just can't get away from
it now and we're going to try a new
eyebrow product today normally I don't
really show you guys brows because I
don't like doing my brows to be quite
honest with you today we're going to try
out a new brow product and we're going
to see this good to the tenant is a
scary brow product but if it goes right
it could be amazing
so makeup forever came out with some new
brow pencils to some new brow gel these
really weird brow liners so obviously
the brow liners are kind of what
intrigued me the most these are the two
colors I'm going back and forth with and
beginner might be this one I have the
shade 20 which is this one right here
I'm going to start so that's to show you
20 this one is the shade 10 so I think
I'm going to go with the shade actually
I'm going to go with 20 I'm going to go
20 basically you're just supposed to
line your brows with this I don't know
girl we're going to figure it out as a
little applicator like that it's not
necessarily what is that it is a felt
tip it's not a brush tip and we're just
going to seasons good wish we want
wish me luck at all
it just looks like an ice cream to
powder formula all right that's not
terrible I like the formula of it I just
can't I can't get it to look how I
wanted to so I'm going to go in with
this elf luck on liner and brow cream
and see if I can make this a little bit
better
okay brows are pretty much done I think
that thing is cool for makeup forever
but I need to practice more with it and
see how I can make it work for me and
make it work quickly but yeah I used
this shade I think it was over 20 and
now I'm going to go in with the makeup
forever brow gel in the shade 25 and I'm
just going to set them in place this
does have little fibers in it which is
my favorite kind of brow gel because it
fills in those little extra areas and it
also gives like highlights to the brow
so to me it looks a little bit more
natural and since I'm pretty bronzed I'm
just going to go in contour and to do
that I'm going to use this flower beauty
lifted sculpt on touring palette I've
been really liking this and literally
all I do with this product is I just tap
my brush in there and then I'll contour
because it gives that perfect amount of
product if you really dig your brush in
there you're going to get way too much
product so I just recommend tapping it
in there and then blending away so
that's it is all you do oh my gosh
so a company sent me macaroons which
I've never heard of this bakery before
but she sent me macaroons to
congratulate me on my engagement and
they are the best macaroons I think I've
ever had in my life
I think it's called Dana yeah Dana's
bakery you guys should check them out
and believe they're based in New York oh
my god
so good actually I think I'm going to
add a little bit of bronzer okay so I am
it adds just a little bit of bronzer on
my cheek
that means this Mac 1 4 0 s brush which
I just got in the mail as PR and I
thought it was like the perfect kind of
shape for bronzing so
we're just going to use this to kind of
dust
just a little bit you know on the temple
and I like it because it's kind of
squished so you can just get right in
here
you know right where you need a bronze
and kind of contour the face by the way
I you see Physicians Formula butter
bronzer when I just used up okay so now
I'm going to go in with this flower pot
powder brush this is from flower beauty
again so it has a soft satin finish it's
easy to blend buildable color and it's
in the shade sweet pea so that's what
looks like I love it you can see the
color that's it right there a really
nice mauve pink very pigmented and
creamy so these my blush brush tap off
the excess because you never know
ooh I like that she's like a little
flush next up I want to use my pro
palette this is my spotlight highlight
palette I created with Smashbox
cosmetics and this is in the shade pearl
I'm going to use this elf brush is the
elf flawless concealer brush is actually
a really nice brush as well to use with
this you didn't want to buy the
Anastacio eighty-three which the Anasazi
at 83 is currently living in my purse
with my palette because I have a palette
in my purse that I keep with me so it's
currently living in there so I've been
using this elf one
so pretty
I'm going to take the same pearl palette
I'm going to highlight my brow bone with
this taking the lightest shade I'm gonna
go under my brow add a little pop of
highlight a shimmer since we have such a
matte shadow going on figured a little
shimmer win hearts also going to pop
some here in the inner corner right up
the inner corner area and then I'm going
to go in with my black liner which is
NARS via veneto
I'm taking this color hello camera
taking this color right here I'm just
going to push this underneath my lower
lashes Oh time for lips I actually
originally I wanted a lip like this but
I feel like this is going to be too much
for this look so I'm going to use
something different what literally a lip
pencil did that I know it's a more feet
like a lip in jealousy and I'm just
going to put that on top
that's pretty a little dark actually now
I'm going to take this color from ciaté
it's called delight I'm fit this in the
middle to lighten it up a little bit
like a nice so ombre okay so that is it
for this video I really hope you guys
