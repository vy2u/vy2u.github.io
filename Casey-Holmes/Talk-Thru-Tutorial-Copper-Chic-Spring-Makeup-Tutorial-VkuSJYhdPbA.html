a tutorial on this look it's just a
bronze makeup look really bronze eyes
with a pin a rose pink lip and I really
like this look I think it's gonna look
so pretty like with a tan and the spring
and summertime what really inspired me
to do this was this quad I just got from
Maybelline today this isn't the color
copper chic and I'm obsessed with this
quad I loved it so much it is so
beautiful the colors are very vibrant
and pigmented and then another thing
that inspired it was a Zevon Sheen
lipstick in rose dressing which of
course is what I have on today I think
it is so beautiful so I didn't include
some more drugstore products in this
video for you guys that had some
requests to include a little bit more my
videos so I did that for you today and
yeah I hope you guys enjoy this look and
let's just go ahead and get started
okay so I've decided to top it through
this video with you guys um I haven't
done like a talked through video I feel
like in a really long time at least a
tutorial and since this one is really
easy to do I figured why not to do it
today my eyes are kind of red and stuff
because I just got done washing my face
because this tutorial just sprung upon
me tonight I primed my eyes it what they
weren't drugstore I used my regular
primers from NARS and Mac of course you
can use whatever you have and I am going
to prime my face here in a minute I've
applied a gel for my rosacea and my
redness and now it's just showing like
all imperfections that I have on my skin
like you can see I guess this is what
less is left over from rosacea no I
might have to go back to my
dermatologist about that or anyone I'd
start with eyes and it's super easy
we're gonna get down to it this is the
Maybelline colorized studio and this is
the copper chic quad and it's absolutely
stunning we're gonna be using these two
front shades and then the highlight
shade I take my finger and I'm going to
take this copper shade right here and
I'm just going to apply this to my lid
okay now I'm going to do is take a sigma
e25 and dip it into that copper shape
tap off quite a bit I'm just going to
buff this into my crease this is going
to be the main color on our I take just
bringing it here into the crease and I'm
also going to drag it out a little bit
again we will clean up the edges so it
didn't worry I'm just going to do this
kind of create my outline where I want
this shadow to go zoom in a little bit
so again right here and the creeps
my eyes are burning I think I got my
face wash in my eye because it isn't
burning so go just here I'm gonna drag
it up a little bit this color is so
tight
okay so now I'm going to take this
little mini log pad you can use any kind
of skin tone shade that you have or
anything that's a little bit darker than
your skin tone and we're just going to
use this middle color which is light
brown of course if you have a light
brown shade feel free to use it this is
just the color I'm using and I'm just
going to blend out the edges of the
shadow a little bit and just add a nice
transition shade
and you can see these shadows just the
land so beautifully what I'm gonna do is
I am going to take my finger going back
in with that same the copper chic
palette is a copper chic or cover chick
I think it's cover sheet and I'm gonna
take this little one color this like up
Capri plum I don't know I'm going to put
this in the iron part of my eye
I'm just gonna blend it in right in
there just to add some extra depth and
dimension to this look I'm just keeping
it basically on the outer lid I'm not
going too crazy with it just want a
little bit right in there
we're just going to go ahead and use my
Estee Lauder Double Wear and three w1
tawny
okay now that we've got this foundation
on we're going to take the mac
prolongwear concealer this is in NW 25
and then we're going to blend it out
with the Sigma f80 six
I'm gonna take a little bit extra
Evette Pro Longwear just a tiny bit put
some on my chin just a highlight and a
little bit on my forehead again just the
highway north came out with these mat
multiples and I had to get the bronze
one this one's in viña TM oh I don't
know honey if you don't want to spend
the money on the NARS totally
understandable you can always do like
the Maybelline fit me foundations they
have a ton of different shades so if
you're lighter darker whatever it'll
work for you
I'm not gonna apply this directly
underneath my cheekbone because
sometimes I find it's a little harsh
it's only me taking the Sigma soft a
blender concealer this is what looks
like it's a really nice brush I'm just
going to get some product on it like so
you don't need a lot I'm just going to
start outlining my contour so I like to
work with it quickly after I've applied
and when you use the Sigma small duo
fiber I'm just going to blend this out
and I really like this product it's
gonna be great for spring and summer so
you don't have to have a ton powder on I
find that even though I have oily skin I
still really like it so just and it's
really easy to build up to just really
lightly you don't have to have like a
super intense contour it's it a little
bit more on the orangie side but I find
that it does work for contouring because
it's not it's not too bad as long as you
blend it out really nicely
and then for my forehead my life today
was I think to go back to the small
duo-fiber and again just kind of repeat
the process
I'm going to take a little bit right on
the bottom of my chin just to kind of go
along with the whole bronzed look we've
got going on with this do you feel like
you have any harsh lines just take your
foundation brush that you use and go in
and just blend it out even more now to
set everything I'm taking this L'Oreal
True Match mineral powder I really like
this powder it's super finely milled so
I really like it I'm going to just set
my face with this
to go along with the bronze look I do
want to kind of set the wrongs are we
just put on with a powder favorite
bronzer from the drugstore is this NYC
Sun and bronze bronzer in Montauk I love
this something it's amazing so I'm just
a crush in here and I'm just doing a
light dusting of this I don't need a
whole lot since we just did like cream
contour so I'm very lightly just going
to hit the spots that we applied that
NARS product just to make it look nice
bronze and put together
this is a master highlight face studio
highlighting blush this is in the color
quarrel so I'm just going to swear my
brush in it and apply it to my cheeks
you can also use Milani Luminoso but I
use that in my last tutorial so I want
to use something different and it don't
mean this create like a nice glow but
I'm gonna have a highlighter on top just
because we're really going for a nice
glowy bronzed look
blend it out it's a really pretty color
for a blush I mean I get a lot I me not
to highlight I'm taking this Physicians
Formula highlighter cannot remember what
it's called because the back fits off
I'm just gonna use this to highlight my
cheekbones I notice that this is in the
color bronze or whatever bronze color it
is so pretty I'm gonna add this to my
nose top of my lip just to add some
extra now I'm going to do eyebrows I'm
going to be using the same products that
I always used lately that I've been
using lately this is a Tarte Amazonian
clay waterproof brow mousse in taupe so
I'm gonna wanted to do my brows I'm
gonna do this off camera because I plan
on doing a whole video on it and yeah
I'll just be right back so now I'm gonna
be taking a pencil brush with that same
copper shade we used earlier we're just
going to apply this right there I'm
applying it from like my teared up to
about halfway on my eye so I really want
this color to pop and I'm going to take
that darker shade and apply that to
the outter have the darker shade that we
use right here on the outer half
now I'm going to take a sigma e25 I'm
just gonna blend out and amaze my lower
lash line just to make sure it's nice
smoked out don't have any harsh lines
now I'm gonna be taking a brown eyeliner
this is from Sigma it's in the shade
nutmeg just take whatever brown liner
you have and just line the inner rim and
then I'm gonna line my upper waterline
with a black eyeliner you can use
whatever you have now I'm going to curl
lashes and apply mascara and once on
apply false lashes but I decide not to
because I really just want this to be
simple for you guys if you do want apply
false lashes out I recommend like the
demi wispies from ardell I think it
would be stunning I'm gonna go ahead and
just go without lashes so I'm using the
Loreal telescopic carbon black mascara
and I feel like you don't want to forget
your bottom lashes just because I feel
like it really opens up your eyes so
after that I'm going to apply a lip
liner I'm just applying a nude one
because I'm gonna have a lip liner to
really go with the lipstick I'm using
today I'm applying this Revlon lip liner
is the color stay lip liner and nude
okay so after lining my lips I'm going
in with this lipstick from divet
Givenchy Jean wash any cuz you wash
it I don't know it's too fancy for me to
talk about this isn't the color Rose
dressing I got this as a sample from
Sephora and I got this color in the mail
and I'm in love with it I think it is so
beautiful so I couldn't really find a
great dupe in my collection though
closest one I found was this Milani
fruit punch I'm gonna apply this all
over my lips
then I'm gonna go ahead and top it off
with this maybelline color elixir though
that's what the peddle plush looks like
it's really nice I like these color
elixirs a lot and then you are done so
that is it for this makeup look I hope
you guys enjoyed it and enjoyed me
talking through it even though I feel
like I rambled for forever
thank you guys so much for watching if
you enjoyed the video please give it a
thumbs up and I'll list all of you pugs
I used down below and I will see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
