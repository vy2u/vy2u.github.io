on this look it's just kind of like a
coppery golden tan eye with a pinky lip
and I really like this look I think it's
really pretty for summer if you're you
know getting tan and you're just going
out I think it's just such a pretty look
at is definitely very summery so that's
why I want to do it
and I kind of love the way it's so
shimmery it kind of looks wet in a way I
don't know I really like it
you can substitute any of these colors
for matte shades if you prefer matte but
I figured I'd do some serene colors
today this was gonna be a let's talk
getting ready video but I haven't been
feeling good today so I'm just going to
talk through the video I'm just in a
voiceover so I'm sorry but this is also
the third time I've tried filming this
video because the last couple times I've
been out of focus so if you guys want to
see how I got this look and some new
beauty products that I purchased
recently
I'll put in this video and I'll let you
know some of my favorite brushes that I
use as well and I'll have everything
linked in the bottom bar so if you want
to see how to get this look then people
ask you okay so let's go ahead and get
started with face products now the first
thing I'm going to be applying is my
Yves pearl mattifying gel and I really
like this stuff it's perfect for the
summer keeps me nice and matte and then
I'm gonna go in with my clinic
Foundation and this Real Techniques
expert face brush I don't know what I
feel about the foundation yet it is
really nice coverage but I don't
necessarily know if it keeps me very
matte yet so I'll keep you guys updated
on that but it does have really great
coverage and I love applying it with
this brush I didn't used to use this
brush a lot I used to use it for tanning
but recently I've gravitated towards it
and I really like it but the one thing I
do do is take the Beauty Blender and Pat
any excess in just because the brush can
leave brushstrokes and I don't like that
taking the Mac Pro Longwear in NC 20
going to put this underneath my eyes and
then take my favorite brush you guys
know I love and adore this brush it's
think take a bird kabuki f-86 and I use
this to blend down my under-eye
concealer I highly recommend this blush
I think everyone needs to try it I use
it in almost all my videos
it's a necessity so definitely check it
out then I'm taking my Mac Pro and
concealed palette I think it's called an
insane medium I'm taking those two
shades and I'm putting them on my nose
because that's the first place where I
get really red and any foundation or
whatever I have on my nose will fade so
this really helps with that taking my
makeup forever matte velvet or super
matte loose powder I always do that I
take that same f-86 brush and I'm going
to put that underneath my eyes and also
on my nose to set all that concealer and
I'll have links to all the brushes and
everything down below in the bottom bar
now I'm taking another new purchase this
is the Clinique stay matte powder it's
in I think one on one transparent and
I'm taking an elf kabuki brush one of my
favorite brushes and I'm just going to
set my face with this I do really like
the powder it's nice and finely milled
so it doesn't look cakey
on the skin going in with a new bronzer
this is a NARS bronzer and it's called
Laguna I do like this bronzer and I'm
taking also a Real Techniques powder
brush I do like this bronzer but I've
tried contouring with it and I don't
really like it to contour I just like it
to bronze up the skin so that's what I
think about that I think it could go in
with another bronzer which I'm about to
show you in contour but this was really
nice it's just giving you some more
color on your face so to contour I'm
willing to take the bombs Bahama Mama
bronzer love this stuff and taking the
Mac 109 Sigma does have an alternative
one of this that's really good I'll put
it down below but I'm gonna take this
brush and just slightly contour not too
crazy or anything but I want a little
bit more definition to my face and then
I'm going to take it to the tops of my
temples downsize my nose underneath my
lip because I like to make my lip look
at a little bit extra pouty taking a new
blush from Smashbox this is the halo
blush it's in peachy dream so pretty so
messy but it's so pretty and these
blushes do last a really long time but
these blushes are really pigmented and
they blend out really really nicely so
that's another reason why I like it
I picked this color because I figured I
get the most use out of it I think
they're about $24 a piece
I'm from Sephora and now I'm going in
with the bombs mary-lou manizer this is
a beautiful highlight I kind of think I
like this more than my soft and gentle I
don't know though and I'm taking just a
regular blending brush from Sonia Kashuk
I think it was a limited edition brush
and I'm just applying this to the tops
of my cheekbones just for some highlight
now I have already applied my Mac Paint
Pot in soft ochre for primer and I'm
gonna be using this Mac pigment in tan
and to apply it I'm taking D Mac
two-on-two brush but Sigma also has
another one it's the e 15 I think it's
literally the same thing you can do you
know the same exact thing with it it
applies just as much product but I
purchased the Mac one so that's the one
I'm gonna be using today and I did spray
it with the mac fix+ just to make the
color you know go on a lot better and
more pigmented and it kind of gives that
foiled look which I really like so I'm
just applying this all over the lid and
a little bit into the tear duct and
underneath the lower lash line a little
bit then going in with Mac's soft brown
I love this color I'm going to be using
it as my transition color and the brush
I use for this is the Sigma tapered
blending it's the e-40 and I love this
brush it blends out amazingly I was
using the Sigma what was it the e-40
that I got my mr. bunny set but I really
like the one I'm using here applying
soft brown because it just does it so
effortlessly this is a Z palette that i
depotted wet-and-wild shadows in I'm
taking a kind of coppery color and this
is a brush I recommend for everybody you
need one of these blending brushes in
your makeup collection it's the e25 it
blends out amazingly and it's so
multifunctional you should definitely
check it out taking my favorite thing
ever the last card I'm using that
coppery color and I'm just starting it
out on the outer half of my eye and
working it into my crease and a little
bit on the outer half as well on the lid
so again just blending that out I
absolutely love the coppery color with
the tan pigment I think it looks so
pretty and just oh so pretty for summer
so I'm taking that brush again and just
kind of touching up and blending out
things I can spot
and now for highlight this is a
permanent color from went wild it's
called brulee it's the most gorgeous
highlight ever I really recommend it and
I'm taking a Revlon shadow brush I think
this is all over shadow brush and I'm
applying that color all underneath my
brow bone then I'm taking this color
from my mouth it's also a permanent
color can't remember what it's called by
this permanent and I'm taking a sigma
pencil brush and I'm just going to apply
this on my lower lash line just to add
some depth to the eye look and then
going back in with another e 25 I'm
taking that same color and I'm going to
just apply this directly in the crease
just to add a little bit more depth and
dimension to the eye I really like this
color and I think all of these colors
together look so pretty
especially if you like shimmery shadows
I just really really really like it and
this color is perfect for the crease
because it's not too much but it still
adds that depth that you want then I'm
going back in with a different blending
brush and I'm just blending it out
making sure that copper color goes all
the way into the inner part of my eye
taking this scandal eyes Rimmel eye Kohl
and nude this is beautiful and it really
lightens up your eyes it's gorgeous
taking this new covergirl ink it
eyeliner I swear by this you guys just
wait til my favorites video I'm going to
tell you all about it it's perfect for
your waterline and it doesn't smudge I'm
obsessed
you've got tried out but I line my upper
waterline with that taking my wet and
wild Fergie gel liner I've been loving
this lately I'm using the Mac 210 but
again another one I love is the Sigma I
can't remember the number but it had
black liner all over it which is why I
didn't use it but I'm taking the Mac one
with that liner and I'm just going to
line my upper lash line I'm not gonna do
a wing or anything if you guys would
like to see an update a winged liner
tutorial I would love to do that for you
just let me know in the comments below
because I feel like I've gotten pretty
good at it so let me know if you guys
want to see that and I'm going to take
my Tarte Brown mousse and the brush that
it comes with I love this for my brows
it's just amazing this brow mousse is
like a must-have for summer and I'm just
going to fill them in per usual
I want to like get really better with my
brows I'm constantly experimenting with
them but so far this is why I've been
loving to do just kind of give them more
of an arch and fill them in nicely so
that's what I'm doing here and this
brush that they give you with it is so
good you've got to try it out and I got
mine off of HauteLook taking my brow bar
to go from lightly not lightening I'm
gonna take the wax and I do still have a
coupon code for this if you're
interested I'll put it down below but
this wax is really nice and just setting
those brows in place taking the
Maybelline big eyes mascara I know I was
going to do a review on this but I
filmed this two times so the first
impression review was kind of like out
the window but I'm going to take it and
just apply the bigger one on my upper
lashes I actually really love this
mascara I love the fact that it's a two
in one and it's so amazing the brush for
your bottom lashes is so small and
really easy to get to and I just love
this mascara I think it's really nice so
thumbs up taking these gypsy lashes
they're number 96 I'll put a direct link
down below I absolutely love these
lashes they're so wispy and pretty then
this Rimmel liner in natural I'm just
going to go ahead and line my lips and
then I'm taking my new lipsticks from
Milani I'm obsessed with these this
one's called nude cream
it's the perfect nude color because it's
not too nude at all
and I'm just going to put this on my
lips and these smell like watermelon I
absolutely love them I have to go pick
up more colors I got three but I want to
get more and now I'm taking a fruit
punch and just applying it over top just
to add a little bit more pinky coral
enos to it and I just these are so
pigment to you guys you have to try them
out then taking my Mac Pro Longwear lip
