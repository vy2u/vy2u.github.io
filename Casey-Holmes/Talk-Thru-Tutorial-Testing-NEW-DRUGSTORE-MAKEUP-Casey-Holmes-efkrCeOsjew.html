today I decided to do a makeup tutorial
slash get ready with me on this look
right here I've had so many of you who
request this makeup look because a
thrill it's all I've been wearing all
month I decided to someone for you guys
today but if you follow me on snap it's
Katie Holmes 35 I showed you guys that I
purchased so much new makeup from does
that make sense so much new makeup I
bought a lot of new makeup from the
drugstore I did incorporate a lot of
that into this video most of this look
is drugstore like the lips the
foundation the concealer powder the eye
shadow the eye brows most of it is
drugstore some very excited for you guys
and see it and you'll get to see my
first impressions on things but if you
want to see a drugstore haul please give
this video a thumbs up so I know because
then I'll show you guys the rest of the
stuff that I got because there's a lot
more left to share with you guys I have
a couple high end things in this video
that like the Stila glitter this is in
diamond dust so good you guys want to
see it in action so I decided to
incorporate that in this video and then
I am also wearing my spotlight palette
in gold I love this thing is so good
these are on sale on Sephora there'll be
a note up very very soon I'll have the
dates below when it's in autumn but yeah
I'm wearing gold today before you
started don't forget to hit that
subscribe button so if you want to get
ready with me and see a bunch of new
makeup products in action then let's go
ahead and it get started but I am weak I
was wrong my drugstore stuff I have okay
this is not your source this is a PR
package but into their craziness so much
stuff so the first thing I want to
dabble in is this makeup revolution
palette this is a dupe for the Kat Von D
one if you guys don't know the shade in
my eye palette this is pretty much
identical I know
makeup revolution does that a lot they
like to dupe high-end products so I'm
still going to climb with my regular
NARS eyeshadow primer because nothing
can hang with this honestly
gosh tape should you know hook me up
with some free tape I mean come on now
I'm praying that this has really good
pigmentation if this does not have
really good segmentation I have a
different quad I want to try out so bad
it's the LA girl I love
mesmerizing palette this is in the
shade urbanize it's an all matte palette
I don't know about you but this gives me
some type of feeling you know what I
mean like this is gorgeous neutrals Matt
you can't go wrong you have everything
you need in one palette again this is
the makeup revolution ultra eye contour
palette
it looks so freakin pretty that's what
it looks like it's very very pretty
dip our little fingers in here shall we
it looks nice
you like the high-pitched voice right so
you're like we're going to have to see
how it applies on the eyes though so you
get my brushes over here so the first
color that I'm going to take is this one
right here I'm going to set my eye
shadow Wow okay
and set my eyeshadow primer would said I
love Sephora and I love shopping at
Sephora but there's something it like
this year I feel like maybe like the end
of last year this year there's just
something about drugstore makeup that
makes me so much more excited I guess
just because it's so affordable and you
could try out a lot more items for the
price and let me tell you guys I went on
Ulta calm I mentioned this on my
facebook life but I went on also calm
and purchase all these products because
there were so many new drugstore items
and I went to check out and it was like
want to use your also points and I'm
like I don't know what all the points
are and I've had all these points saved
up like after I've been shopping at Ulta
and I didn't even know it and I applied
my point to this order this order was
200 and I think $38 I paid twenty one
dollars for it because I applied my
point what I didn't know points equaled
money I did not know that I was like
what else can i buy but I didn't end up
buying any more I just bought what I had
for twenty one dollars that is insane
shoe I wish everything with that Ulta
because then I would have hella points
and not pay for anything you know what I
mean well that's kind of not true
because I was paper stuff I find that so
interesting so shout outs also for
having some bangin point values I mean
that is awesome so I'll get a little
excited but I'm going to go on with this
shade right here alright so lets blend
this into the crease
it's not bad it's kind of choppy but
we're going to see if we can make it
work but it looks nice I mean the
pigmentation is there I don't want it to
be too pigmented because this is a Cree
shade and I'm just trying to you know
zero color and the crease not make it
too intense but it is kind of choppy I
think you guys can see what I'm talking
about
in some parts is darker and then in some
parts it's just choppy and not looking
too good
okay what I'm going to do is I'm
actually going to try out this palette
to on the other eye just to see how well
it works but I'm going to go in with
this one right here I usually don't like
palettes like this that are like a weird
shape going on but the pans are pretty
big so my brush can fit in there
comfortably so comfortably like I'm
worried about it where you have two
different I think's going on okay I like
that warm shade that's my kind of shade
so far that's blending a lot you see the
difference between this eye and this
side this one is blending so well y'all
at this side as well I'm sorry I'm not
losing anything else other than this and
two like letters for the next month you
see on here it does have some kick back
but honestly I don't care about that
because it's affordable and it blends
well it doesn't hurt my feelings you
know what I mean now I'm going to go in
I'm just going to go ahead and use this
one I'm going to go in with this shade
right here and put this into my crease
see how this looks together I think it's
kind of different just because that
first shade was so warm and this one's
more cool toned so it's interesting to
see how they work together but I don't
think it looks bad and then what I'm
going to do is I'm going to take a
little brush this one's from Mac this is
the matte 239 he's not going to go in
with a really deep color put this matte
brush I'm just going to put this in the
outer of these and smoke it about
halfway this isn't as dark as I thought
it was going to be but looking like you
can build it up
and here's what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to take a fluffy brushes from
Sigma e25 instead of using a really
dense brush and just fluff that in the
outer V instead I don't think it looks
bad it seems like it's building really
well nice and smoky and if you like just
simple eyeshadow looks in something
where like I'm going to put the Sela
glitter here in the inner corner if you
just love something easy to do for
everyday you can kind of go from a
really nice daytime look to a nighttime
look by just smoking it out then I'm
going to go in with the Mac 242 and take
this white shade and put this in the
inner corner it's not like a WoW inner
corner highlight but it's not terrible
how we're going to even this out going
to go back into that first day we used
and just try to blend it out a little
bit more maybe it was the brush
all right thing and it was the brush
because that just went on pretty well
I'm using the Sigma or no way this is
one season more fils-aime for 4:01 and
then this is the mac 217 I'm going to go
in with this one right here just see if
we could kind of even those eyes out so
what's this in the crease all right
maybe I was talking crap too too quickly
I'll be the first to admit about some
crap still a little choppy here in the
inner corner and then we can borne that
out I'm going to go back in with that
morphe brush going up the inner corner I
hate it when my inner corner gets choppy
I just don't understand it and there's
like a no way to fix it sometime so I'm
just gonna not gonna worry too much
about it today but definitely getting
choppy in the inner corner now I'm going
to do is I'm going to go in with this
deeper color wow that was intense
that was black I'm just going to go in
and put this in the outer corner same
brush okay don't feel bad that is not
bad
you know I don't know which one I prefer
I'm going to go in with a makeup
revolution on this side just deepen it
up a little bit more go in with this
cream shade right here
with that same math brush you see how
well this applies well that was
definitely more intense see how much
more intense one is and this one this
one's just like more of a natural cream
shade I can't wait to play with these
warm shades I wanted to keep it kind of
simple just the child as eyeshadows but
I promise you there will be different
tutorials coming soon now I'm going to
take the two-faced glitter glue just on
the back of my hand and I'm going to be
using the Stila
Magnificent metals glitter glow eye
shadow liquid eye shadow in diamond dust
you guys have wanted me to use this in a
video for a while so I'm going to show
you how to use it I'm just going to put
this right here in the inner corner and
go about half way on my lid you want to
work quickly with this I've mentioned it
before but this glitter glue does dry
fairly quickly and once it's dried
you're pretty much screwed so I'm going
to do that and then I'm going to take
directly off the applicator and pretty
much just draw on my eye going to go
above the crease just because I have
more his eyes that way you'll be able to
see when I close and I do more of a
heavy hand here in the inner corner and
as I get to the outer parts I just kind
of lightly flick it just to kind of
blend it in a way so you can see more
intense right in here and as you go out
it's a little less intense and then we
do the same exact thing on the other eye
I find if I don't use this glitter glue
fall that will be absolutely everywhere
by the end of the day the first time I
ever wore this I went out with to
Sephora and whole girl I came home and I
was like wow ice clear all over my face
and then a lot of you told me to try it
with a glitter glue or just a really
good primer so I decided to whip out the
glitter glue and test it out and I liked
it a lot more with it I really like this
applicator I find that it's really easy
to apply this way I like taking the
shades and then instead of using this
chocolate brown going in with this black
right here in the outer corner cuz it
really sums it up and it makes it look
really nice I like that combo a lot now
we're going to try a new eyeliner again
from la girl I got a lot of new stuff
from la girl but this is the matte
eyeliner
and I love Matt eyeliners my makeup
forever ink liner is Matt and it is the
best so when I saw that this was Matt I
was like I got to try it
I gotta try it this is quick drying
smudge proof water-resistant and rich
color payoff I'm giving it a really hard
test today seeing if it can apply over
glitter nicely I'm kind of going in cars
with this you're going to see if it'll
work like some makeup for everyone my
makeup for everyone just glides right
over but you know I'm not going to judge
it too hard if it doesn't really go over
the glitter very well but it's nice to
see so this is what the packaging looks
like I actually really like it it looks
good
ooh I like that I like that okay so this
is what it looks like and then you take
it off and as a felt-tip I love felt it
so I might like this a lot there's a
swatch of it hold it right quick not the
blackest eyeliner ever when you first
watch it but it is really nice kind of
like a black Bray you can do it liner so
far is going over the glitter pretty
nicely behind the tie part I don't like
my glitter showing through my liner not
as pigmented as I like looks good but
it's like up close it's just it's not my
favorite so I'm going to go over it with
my makeup forever ink eyeliner and say
that one for a different look I don't
have a lot of glitter on okay guys so
I'm going to apply lashes and then I'll
be back to apply a new was foundational
said to try so paradise okay so while we
wait for my less glue to get tacky I'm
going to go ahead and try a new
foundation I'm going to use my regular
primers that I know I love as a Smashbox
primer water and the canon austin
mattifying primer I'm going to go ahead
and apply this real quick so the
foundation I'm applying today is the la
girl pro coverage HD high death long
wear illuminating foundation Malone
never smells illuminating part but I
feel like if I said with a powder we
should be okay hopefully but I have two
shades I have to shade natural and the
nude beige so I'm going to take the
little packaging off and see if I can
tell what color would be best but I
think this was like the newest one that
they came out with and people were doing
videos on it a while back but I haven't
watched any videos on it and I just want
ahead and bought it and I'll probably do
a wear test on this as well because I
affordable foundations went wild photo
focus is the bow I'm always down to try
new drugstore foundations just cuz I
love when they work because I love
toaster make if you help it do you want
to go in with this one this one's the
shade nude beige I like the packaging
but it looks like it is plastic but it
has a pump I mean you can't beat that I
really could care less it's a glass
package or a bottle so this is what the
color looks like and I'm going to do one
side of my face with my sponge this is
the Loreal sponge and the one side of my
face with a brush supplies oh yeah a
full coverage Wow how crazy
okay so again that shade is nude beige
and that matches my self tan pretty dang
good I like it I'm liking it so far I
think it's looking really nice on the
skin very very nice I know the color is
a lot different than this patented face
but we're messing myself pan so I'm
really liking it it does have a glow to
it so it makes me a little nervous I
mean it's pretty dang glowy so I'm going
to go in with a brush on the other side
so I'm just going to run this out look
at that cheese leave oh my gosh that is
some coverage you guys I'm gonna go
ahead and just do my nose and everything
with brush they both look the same like
wow I look glowy oh god I feel like the
brush on my forehead it's kind of
breaking up some of the product
oh whoa what's going on there so I'm
just going to press it into the skin so
audacity foundation looks like the
coverage is phenomenal it is so nice
then super scared at how luminous it is
like it makes me very very nervous so
we're just gonna have to see how it
works
I feel like it's starting to sink into
the skin on this side and not look as
glowy as the brush side I might be
insane but I feel like that's happening
okay so now I'm going to use this la pro
girl concealer I use just once I think a
long time ago but I didn't continue
using it I don't know
why lisanna made that big of an impact
on me but I really want to try it again
and see how I feel about it because I
know a lot of people love this concealer
so I just want to get back into it again
if submit oh and this is the HD high def
concealer as well so perfect to go with
the HD foundation this is a concealer it
has a brush tip you squeeze it and it
comes out on the oh they're just on the
brush so we're just going to put under
our eyes like I normally do color is
really nice with that foundation now
like I want all my foundations of that
shade looking pretty good so far
very highlighted right now the color
that I chose I'm actually kind of
filling the concealer right now I think
it looks really smooth if it all blended
out now we need to set the base so I'm
going to use the LA girl Pro powder high
def setting powder I didn't even realize
I got all the HP products for LA girls I
guess it's a good thing because I'm
pretty sure they're also sort together
does come with the puffs but I'm not
going to keep that I also have a pressed
powder I believe it's from Le girl as
well that I might set the rest of my
face makeup with but we'll see the shade
right there all right make me Matt
please and not look cakey we're just
going to set this some baked really let
it melt into the skin hopefully get us
nice and matte now I'm going to take
this elf lock-on liner and Dow cream and
light brown I want to try this for my
brows and I really like elf light ratio
I want to test this out and a little pot
like this it was halfway open that's not
cool but that's the product right there
and I'm going to use my regular Sephora
brush to speak before number 20s the pro
growl I love palmade so I will always
use a pomade if you guys are curious I
like this color
and it's applying really easily
sometimes the drugstore like brow pomade
or whatever or liners like this they
won't be super pigmented so then you
have to keep building and when you build
it up sometimes the color just like
slice away so it's more difficult to
work with so this is really intense and
it's really sticking onto the skin
nicely I really don't have to build it
up because the color is still pigmented
so I am liking this so far so now mine
is set with the two face to brow quickie
this is in the shade Universal taupe so
it's just going to lighten them up and
really fill in those sparse areas make
them look a little bit fuller now we're
going to dust away the baking that we
did hoping would look a little bit more
matte the foundations breaking up right
here don't know why but from far it was
okay up close though it's just writing
up on my cheeks I think you can see it
right there you can see the redness
peeking through but this side looks good
that may be a sponge is the way to go
because look at that oh gosh I'm going
to use a different browser I'm going to
use the Physicians Formula butter
bronzer this is the darkest shade I know
that there's two I was always nervous to
buy this because I thought it was just
the lightest one and I knew it would be
too light for me but then you guys told
me they had a darker shade so once I saw
this online I snatched the darker shade
so I could try it out for you guys I've
heard that this smells amazing we're
gonna see the packaging is really very
cute hmm that does smell good I'm gonna
use a Tom Ford brush I know ridiculous
Tom Ford brush with nice drift or
bronzer wow that smells good bronzing
nicely you see that whoo oh no things
down new one thing my Neutrogena bronzer
is going to put on the backburner
I thought to douse myself in this
bronzer yet so smooth and bronzed oh my
gosh and it does come with a little
brush that I just dropped in a mirror
whoa okay I'm obsessed with the color of
this I love it I think it's beautiful so
now that that's going really well we're
going to use the Physicians Formula
matte sculpting palette I saw this when
I was in Kroger getting food and I was
like let me just go to the makeup
section and I saw this and I was like
yeah I need to try that out so now that
I tried that buy bronzer I have high
hopes for this look looks like you have
three shades you have a light medium and
dark shade this one is more actually
this one's more warm and then you just
have like a vanilla kind of banana
highlight like a very light yellow and
then you just open it up oh that's nice
of them you get a mirror and a little
brush which I'm going to try today
because I'm kind of feeling how this
looks so it's just the angle fluffy
brush like this okay let's see how it
works I'm going to go in with the add
more ashy comb just to create more of
that shadow effect underneath my
cheekbone one thing is like this doesn't
bend back really well so I'm just going
to hold it with one hand
let's get product
and you know what this brush is not half
bad okay it does still TP but it does
the job I'm not gonna lie to you guys I
talk mad crap about Physicians Formula
but these two products are making me
rethink everything I felt about them for
the last few years like ever since I
started my channel I just haven't been a
huge physician formulas fan but well a
little bit of the warm tone on top
looking pretty actually right now I
think if you're more on the fair side
you'd really like it I'm just going to
top it with the more warm shade that's
really intense now I did that to myself
okay
okay so I kinda just did that to myself
where I have too much product on but it
was blending really well I just put too
much product on okay but I really like
that shadow that it created I just put
too much on because that's me
get tested out right all right now I'm
going to take this new L'Oreal blush
palette they sent this to me in PR and I
want to test it out this is their
L'Oreal infallible paint flush and I was
a little nerd aw now that's this is
formula book brush is great with this so
I'm going to take this lighter shade
right here I was a little nervous to try
this out actually I saw this online and
I didn't purchase it and I thought it
was cream with their powders so if
you're like me you don't like cream
don't worry there's not a cream I like
this first shade right here so I'm using
this one because it adds just a little
bit of a rosy hue but it's not too
intense so I'm going to use today is my
Smashbox palette and gold I'm going to
mix these two shades right here since I
am a little bit preppy and coming on
with a tan glowy look I'm just going to
mix these two together it's how I like
to apply it I'm obsessed with this color
so I used two by itself on my face it'd
be too dark so that's why I like to mix
it with this lighter shade right here
and I'm just going to pop this on the
top to my cheek and it gives you that
nice gold glow like I love it if you
wanted something lighter you could just
go with turning on gold but I love that
deeper gold so
just love these Islanders but also likes
it it's all my shoulders and everything
and on my collarbone especially when I
was at the beach I put on my shoulder to
my collarbone now I'm going to line my
waterline
I just use my NARS via veneto eyeliner
for that now we're going to go back into
the makeup revolution palette and I'm
actually going to take this shade right
here and I'm going to put this on my
lower lash line just using a matte
pencil brush because my Mac pencil
brushes are my favorite it's actually a
really pretty color doesn't necessarily
go to looks now they look at it's a
little warm but a little more of a red
brow but we can work with it so now I'm
going to put some mascara on my lower
lashes I'm sitting in finish it roller
lash because it's easy and I have it
right here
I finally bought a sharpener for all my
lip liners and eyeliner so you're going
to be seeing some old favorites come
back because I finally bought a
sharpener so it's amazing but again this
is the Rimmel lasting finish lip liner
in spice then I absolutely love jcat and
their lip product so I saw this and I
really want to try it out
it's the jcat Beauty lips Finity matte
lip and it says kiss proof this is a net
LM ko1 I'm guessing so it says LM ko1 so
I will try to leave the name down below
okay guys so that is the makeup look let
me know what you guys think I can
definitely tell I'm very illuminated
from the foundation so I don't know if
this is going to be a new favorite for
me just because I do have very oily skin
servants I'm going to see how this wears
throughout the day I will keep you guys
updated on this I will do a wear test as
you guys saw it was pretty illuminated
but it was really great covers I feel
like if you have dry skin you would love
it even normal skin if you want
something really doing and luminous you
might really like that foundation
everything else so far I'm really
enjoying and I'm so impressed
I love drugstore makeup so if you guys
do want to see a full haul everything
that I got let me know in the comments
below and yes thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you all in my next
