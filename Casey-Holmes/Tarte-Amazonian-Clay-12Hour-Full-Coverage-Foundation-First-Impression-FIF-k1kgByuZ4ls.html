a first impression on the tarte
high-performance naturals Amazonian clay
12-hour full-coverage foundation and the
color I picked up was tan honey and I've
heard a lot of great things about this
foundation has been around for quite
some time so I'm excited to see how it
works on my skin try to see if there's
any claims that it has I think the only
claim is that it lasts a long time I've
heard that the Amazonian clay is good
for oily skin it's cruelty free so
that's awesome uh and yeah there's
really no claims on the box so we're
just going to get started a I'm going to
be applying it with my sigma f84
and this is what the packaging looks
like and since I'm looking over here
it's because my mirror is over here so
if you were wondering first off it's a
thicker foundation it's not runny at all
I would show you but my palates kind of
gross but yeah it's not even moving when
I wiggle it so it's a pretty thick
foundation so far from what I can tell
when I apply on this side of my face
first so we can see the difference
because you guys know I do have a little
bit of rosacea so we're going to see if
it covers that up
it looks smooth it blended out really
well the colors are pretty good match
for me when I'm not as self tan I'm
going to see if I can build this up like
right here on my cheeks or I see some
redness
I don't normally worry about my
under-eye area because I go on with
concealer so I don't want to take up the
concealer and foundation okay I know the
color is a lot different but obviously I
don't sale to my face but this is with
the Ephesian on and this is what the
foundation not on so you could see the
rosacea and the redness that I have over
here and then over here you don't see it
let me look at it up close I like it I
don't think it's a completely full
coverage foundation
maybe after I put concealer on
underneath my eyes it'll cover up more
of this redness because I do see some
where my redness peeking through but
it's a really nice smooth foundation it
doesn't look like it's sinking into my
pores at all and here's that side that
side let's kind of zoom you guys in
should have done that in the beginning
okay so this is what this side looks
like with just the brush like I said I
don't really think it's full coverage
but I'm going to cover up the redness
quite a bit now we're going to try this
other side with the Beauty Blender I
want to see if maybe that will help give
it some more full coverage power
like I said I do have like the rosacea
and stuff it does cover it up but it's
not something that I think is the best
so far I think my Estee Lauder Double
Wear covers a lot better but the color
is nice for when I'm not in self-tan
times the foundation looks a little bit
different after you put concealer and
stuff on so I am going to do that and
I'm going to come back and give you guys
an update on how I think it looks how
it's set and everything like that so
I'll be back in just a second okay so
I've got the foundation on and I got the
rest of my face makeup on and it's so
far I have to say I really do like it
it's not accentuating my pores and it
looks really flawless on the skin since
I do use the upside down triangle
underneath my eyes it really did help
cover that redness out that the
foundation did not cover very well so I
like it though I think it looks really
pretty on the skin the blush and bronzer
went on amazingly and I'm excited to see
how this lasts throughout the day I did
set it with my NARS powder in beach
which just looks like this so I did set
it in place because I have to set my
foundations if I don't know I'm nuts so
excuse my lips I forgot to put my
lipstick and stuff on before I started
filming but I will update you guys in
just a little bit on how the foundation
is going it is now 310 so I'll see you
guys in just a little bit hi guys so it
is now 728 you probably can't even say
that but it's 728 and we got back from
Christmas shopping a few minutes ago
probably bout 30 minutes ago and I
thought I would update you guys on the
foundation and so far I am really loving
it I will say that my forehead did get
really shiny but it wasn't like greasy
it was just light reflecting off of it
so I definitely had to touch up with
powder but otherwise you guys I love
this foundation I think it looks so
beautiful my highlight my blush my
contour everything is still going strong
which I'm really happy about and yeah I
just I'm really enjoying it I think it
looks so beautiful I'm actually starting
to love it more as the time goes on that
I wear it I did like it when I first
applied it but you know after you do
like a concealer your powder you blush
your bronzer everything just kind of
come
together and works the best thing for me
is that my pores do not look ginormous
so I love that pretty much the update my
forehead I will shine II just had to
touch it up with some powder but
otherwise it's still looking really good
so I will come back in a few hours just
to kind of wrap this video up
it's 7:30 now and I'll just come wrap
this up before I take off my makeup and
yeah I'll see you in a few hours
hey guys so I'm back for my last update
it is now 10:30
oh well hello but it's 539 and I'm about
ready to take off all this makeup but I
did not blot because I wanted to show
you guys kind of how it reacted on my
skin after a couple of hours uh mucusy
my forehead is a good really shiny
little shiny in here again it's not
greasy it's just shiny like it's not
disgustingly oily like I can't really
feel it on my skin just the light really
reflects off my skin in certain areas
and it just looks really shiny I do have
to touch up with powder that's just
something that I'm going to have to do
with this foundation which when you have
oily skin sometimes that's just what you
gotta do you gotta block that oil off
and put some powder on otherwise I do
love the foundation the way I applied it
I would might rather apply it with the
Beauty Blender then the Kabuki brush
that I applied it with just because I
feel like it did cover this redness in
here a little bit more so I would apply
it with the Beauty Blender there's not
really a difference in how it war
between the two I think they still kind
of wore the same exact way but once you
go in with concealer and stuff if you do
the triangle motion underneath your eyes
it's going to cover up that redness if
you still have some in here cuz that's
what it did for me I'm gonna keep the
foundation because I am in love with it
I think it's a perfect match for myself
tan I think it looks just so good I will
be doing an update on the foundation
after I've tried it for a little while
so just stay tuned for that video I will
also link it in the description box
whenever I do the update I think that's
about it so I hope you guys enjoyed this
