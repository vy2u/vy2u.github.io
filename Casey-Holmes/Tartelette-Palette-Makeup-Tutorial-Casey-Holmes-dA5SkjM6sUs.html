a look with the new tartlet palette well
it's not like brand new I'm a little
light on the bandwagon but it is on the
tartlet palette I use all I shadow is
from this and then I use two of my
favorite NYX liquid suede cream
lipsticks I believe these are out right
now on Ulta calm and I think they'll be
in store and Ulta later I don't know but
I really love these I have all the
colors so if you guys want to swatch
video let me know in the comments below
but I did this I look in my last video
which was my Q&amp;amp;A and a lot of you wanted
to see the look it is very dramatic very
fall appropriate and personally when I
put on makeup it's not everyday that I
put on makeup but usually when I do it I
like a nice smokey eye so that's why a
lot of my looks are little bit more
deeper but if you want a lighter look
with this palette let me know in the
comments and I will do that for you I
think these are beautiful and I love
this for my brown eyes I just I love
them so much I think it's great so if
you want to see the tutorial on this
then just keep watching and if you want
to see my last fall inspired makeup look
which let me just say I know a lot of us
are like no not fall but I'm ready for
fall and I'm kind of like going ahead
and just like putting out these fall
makeup looks so um that's why this is
like fall inspired I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you did like this
video don't forget to subscribe so
you'll miss out on any of my future
videos and yeah let's just go ahead and
get started
okay so we're going to take this shade
right here which is a great transition
shade and we're going to put this into
the crease with a big fluffy brush I
really do like this color I do build it
up just a little bit so it's a little
more pigmented and noticeable but I love
it because you can use it really lightly
for just a light transition or you can
build it up to have it nice and intense
and it's just a really great color to
blend with all these other shadows we're
going to put on our lids now I'm taking
this kind of a lighter purple and I'm
going to fluff this in the outer V all
the way towards the center of the lid
and I'm also putting this into my crease
as well this color is also going to help
us blend the really light shade we're
going to put on our lid with the darkest
shade we're going to put on so I just
going ahead and applying this on both
eyes the same exact way
next we're going to take this more dense
brush and we're going to take the darker
purple in the palette and we're going to
put this on the outer half of the I
really just deepening everything up and
again I'm going to do the same technique
as I did with the lighter purple but I'm
not going to bring it in as far so keep
it on the very outer half and you can
just fluff it a little bit into the
center of the lid but don't go in too
far because we would just want to keep
this on the outer half
then I'm going to take that lighter
purple again and we're just going to
blend it into that darker shade you can
also go over the darker shade because it
doesn't really matter it's just there to
add a little bit of depth to the look
and smoke it out but I like to take it
over it just so it all blends evenly
then I'm going to take that same shade
we use in the beginning and go in and
touch up the transition shade
then we're going to take the lightest
shade in here and we're going to put it
in the center part of the eye and this
is going to brighten up our eyes and
make them look nice and open and big and
it's okay if it kind of gets all over
the lid that's completely fine because
we'll just blend it out but focus a lot
of this product on the inner corner of
the eye and I just I love doing this
with my eye show because I do have
downturned eyes so I'd like to make them
look a little bit more awake and a
little bit bigger so we're going to take
that lighter purple we're going to blend
this into that white and this is when
that purple really really pops when you
blend it over that white eye shadow oh
my gosh it looks you too full just make
sure you don't bring it all the way into
the inner corner because it will just
take away what we just did you know and
it won't have a purpose so I just use
that purple to blend it out and it looks
so good and then I take off the tape and
I have a nice sharp line now we're going
in with this benefit push-up liner you
guys told me to use it on the back of my
hand and apply it so that's what I've
been doing and I actually really do like
the liner so it is a purple liner
because I didn't want to do black or
anything too intense but I did do a wing
just to lift up the eyes a little bit
more and yeah I think the purple really
helped enhance the eyeshadow so I love
it
then I'm taking these Ardell glamour
lashes these are not my favorite
actually have a new set of ardell lashes
that I love that I can't wait to share
with you guys but these aren't my
favorite the ones I used in my last
video where goddess by I forget the name
but I'll leave it down below but I just
had to use these because they were all I
had at the moment and then I took my Too
Faced foundation I've been using this so
much lately so you guys are probably
like okay we know the drill but I'm
going to apply that and then also apply
the Urban Decay Naked skin underneath my
eyes and in the center of my face as
well I was just really liking this
concealer at the time I still really
like it but not for a long period of
time
you
after that we're gonna set everything
with a slower Mercier translucent powder
and I'm going to use my Beauty Blender
to set underneath my eyes I am applying
a lot more product than needed but
that's okay because we will let it melt
into the skin and we will dust the
excess away and I've just found that
this technique really gives it a smooth
flawless finish I really love it I've
been doing it a lot lately especially
for a formal event I just went to I I
just love it so I take a duo fiber brush
afterwards and then I just dust away any
excess product in this girl on terra
cotta bronzer I'm going to bronze my
skin with this this is more of a terra
cotta orangie bronzer but I really like
it a lot it makes me look like I just
came back from the beach even though we
know I did not go to the beach taking an
oldie but a goodie the benefit hoola
bronzer oh my gosh this will always be
one of my favorite bronzers ever just
because it's so great to contour with
because it's so easy to work with and I
just oh I'm so obsessed with it
moving on to one of my favorite blushes
this is a two-faced Baby Love blush and
I love this because it gives you a
gorgeous flush to your cheeks it's not
too intense and I just I'm so in love
with this color I've been using it
non-stop lately after blending that out
I'm going to take this highlighter I've
also been obsessed with and it's the
Laura Mercier indiscretion highlighter
and it's just so pretty I'm going to
apply that to the tops of my cheekbones
and it does this just gives like a
gorgeous glow I mean there's nothing
right now that's topping it so pretty
I'm going to go ahead and fill in my
eyebrows and then we're going to go in
with that same white shade and highlight
right underneath the brows just to lift
them and really bring the look together
then taking the NYX two-timer I'm going
to take the kohl liner in line my lower
waterline and then we're going to go in
with the darker purple shade and we're
going to take a smaller square brush and
we're going to press this up against
that lower lash line this part is
optional you don't have to do this if
you don't want to make it as smoky but I
love a good smoky eye so that's what
we're doing today then I'm going to take
the lighter purple in the palette and
blend it out with this with the Mac
pencil brush by far my favorite pencil
brush ever I just think it really really
really blends out the eyeshadow very
well and it's my favorite pencil brush
ever it's very hard for me to use
anything else so highly recommend it if
you're looking for a good one and I
forgot to show it but I did put mascara
on my bottom lashes so don't forget to
do that and then I'm taking this makeup
forever lipliner can't remember the name
but I will leave it down below I'm going
to line my lips with this and then
taking the NYX lip creams I'm going to
just put these on this one is in I
forget I cannot ever see the names of
these so I will leave the names that I
use down below I just mix them together
and I really like the way they turned
out
and then after you apply these you are
completely done with the look so I hope
