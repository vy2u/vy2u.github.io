I'm in a different location with Miss
Laura Lee I'm just so excited to collab
with her two southern girls we love
 la world yes you're wondering
why our lips are a little bit pink you
might want to go check out the video on
Laura's channel because it was very
interesting we had a hard time we just
went through it you can tell by our
faces it was pretty pretty emotional oh
yeah you guys go check it out on Laura's
Channel I haven't linked down below
don't forget to subscribe to Laura today
we have something really interesting to
show you guys and they are actually wine
Olek Tim where did you find these Amazon
how do I can't remember that guys on
yeah I think they were like $25 for both
everyone both ah so affordable they had
some other colors but these were like
the ones that I knew would probably be
best for us to try yeah they're so
they're legit wide bottles it's just so
interesting so I don't really know much
about it cuz on the package it's just in
a different language I don't even know
what language it is as well say unless
you know something I don't
Korea okay Korean this one I guess is
just like a little pink one they're so
cute and you unscrew it like this yeah
pops out cutest in the world
we haven't swatched it we haven't done
anything I've never seen anybody use
this before so for all my winos out
there you know you're gonna love it
you're gonna love this you're gonna pull
this out your purse this amazing we like
girl go love him yeah okay
the dopa is actually like it was really
nice wine Lipton I'm thinking in my head
like what a cute gift at a baby shower
or like bridesmaid yeah is your strong
strong let me smell
mmm is yours different than mine mine's
different than yours
oh this gives me benadryl grape vibes
that's what this reminds me exactly what
that smells like but one thing is like I
think isn't supposed to like
color-coordinated outside that just I
thought that was gonna be a bad like a
maroon is orange yeah that is not what I
expected it to be all right so they're
already playing us a little bit okay
little nice not as pigments not
pigmented not really
yeah they remind me of the YSL oh yeah
pulling sensation of course these are
Lipton so you're not gonna get a lot of
payoff but for one thing I will say if
they are very cooling look at the level
of crusty my lip is on that's a 10
whose markers on our faith in the last
video firs on her face y'all whoa I'm
not gonna put this on my lip you ready I
guess I should be funny it feels so good
I don't knows because how lips are dry
as hell or if it's just a great product
great product or the other you don't
want it he's out like chemical a guy
like a boy might tell me the makeup why
that's like straight chemical like it's
almost like a pungent chemical where you
can't stand it on your tongue it feels
good don't get it on your tongue yeah I
do not like this oh my god I still taste
it I just wipe my tongue with a frigging
bigger I like that it's not like too
intense hmm I like your color too a lot
I do too and you're just showing up
actually pretty that's really the worst
makeup I guess stinky chemical taste
yeah really strong I felt it like in the
back of my throat but that was
disgusting we can't read the bottles we
don't know we're in it's okay thanks rat
poison in Korean yeah we tell her so I
mean it's nice it totally reminds me of
the ys l lipsticks with however if it's
kinda like a do chemical version and not
to mention it it's the cutest thing in
the world is so tiny
what if it was a little beer can like a
little bit like no that's too rash it oh
it too far I think these are so cute
okay I can really do stuff like as mom
bad so other than the chemical taste of
it these are pretty cool I think they're
a little bit better than a Lipton I
getting darker the longer I'm here yeah
and it's got like a nice gloss to it
like a nice little sheen they're not
drawing the scent of this one I prefer
that soon let me smell one more time cuz
this one is like yeah this one smells
almost like a perfume yeah that smells
good good I give this a thumbs up eiders
here but I get a thumbs down for the
chemicals yeah
just and if you don't like grapefruit
benadryl you don't like this one of this
I'll have them down below where you can
get them on Amazon and let me know if
