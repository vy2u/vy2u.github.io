wait to share them with you guys I'm not

good 2016 but I personally did
business-wise personal wise it was just
a really quick year so thank you guys

so you don't miss out yeah let's just
get started with my 2016 favorite hair
let's start with hair products that won
me over this year I'm not going to keep
these products too long-winded I'm just
going to kind of get the bullet points
tell you why I like them and move on to
the next product since we have so much
stuff to talk about I get a lot of
questions all the time asking what
shampoo do you use
I need to know so the shampoo that I use
is the bumble and bumble bee bee
hairdressers invisible oil sulfate free
shampoo woo I have been using this for
so many months I love it I repurchase it
constantly it is a high-end product but
I noticed such a difference with this it
makes my hair super soft silky since
I've been going lighter with my hair the
last part of this year honestly my hair
feels healthier than ever and it's just
because I maintain the shampoo I still
use my macadamia dupe repair mask and
love that stuff it's amazing I think I
mentioned it last year or something I've
been using it for so many years
so I use that as my conditioner and this
is the shampoo that I switched to
because I just noticed a huge difference
I don't have a lot of breakage with this
product my split ends aren't crazy this
is just a great product to really make
your hair stay soft healthy and
manageable I recommend this especially
if you color treat your hair this is the
way to go and then one product that I
like to use that I have really noticed a
difference with styling wise is this
caviar empty ageing replenishing
moisture milk and I love the alternate
caviar brand I think it's amazing and
this is a leave-in conditioning spray
it's free of parabens sulfates and
palely I put this in from the top of my
ears down it's a very lightweight
product it's not going to wear your hair
down which is super important to me my
hair gets really greasy and weigh down
very very easily this is really
lightweight it's awesome you can tell by
the bottle that I've used it constantly
I don't wash my hair a lot I wash my
hair about every four to five days a
shower everyday I just don't wash this
Mane every day I always use this product
before I blow-dry it I feel like it also
helps keep my hair nice and healthy so
love this again I love this brand they
have a lot of great stuff that I just
swear by so let's move on to skincare
this year was the year that I really
went out of my comfort zone and
purchased really high-end skincare these
are the products that I just I love I
love them and I have repurchased them
already throughout the year and I think
they're amazing so let's just get
started first off actually I have not
repurchased this but I will be because I
love it I haven't used this all year but
I've used it more towards the end of the
year it's won me over I love this line
this is my enroll as low and it's the
sensitive cleansing oil I have
everything I've tried from this brand I
have fallen in love with I actually just
tried the sheet mask that's for soothe
and call me it's the pink one as well
and it was just so good it made my skin
so soft and hydrated I loved it and this
is awesome to take off your makeup with
because it takes off absolutely
everything but it's not harsh on the
skin at all my skin doesn't get extra
red from doing it or anything like that
it just takes off all the makeup gently
and I love it a little bit goes a long
way and it's just amazing also clinic
take the day off cleansing balm is
amazing as well I can't remember if that
was this year or not but I love that one
to that one and this one are my top two
makeup removers moving on to moisture
let's talk about daytime first so
daytime for my eyes I have been loving
the it cosmetics bye bye under-eye cream
this is a really nice lightweight
under-eye cream you can probably not
tell but I am almost done with my jar
the cream is a light light light baby
blue but I'm almost done I'm actually
scraping the bottom of this right now
and I like it because it's very very
lightweight and it hydrates that under
eyes so well so when you put makeup or
anything else on top of it it's just
gonna glide on and it doesn't feel too
much for a daytime eye cream you don't
want anything too heavy so this is
perfect and then for my daytime face
moisturizer this is the lemare the
moisturizing gel cream and oh my gosh
this is a great cream because it is a
gel cream so that's really great for
oily skin because it's gonna sink into
the skin really quickly but it's not
going to make you look greasy or
anything like that so gel moisturizers
are amazing you should definitely try
them out if you have oily skin because
they're a lot better for you for the
daytime because you don't get like that
film on top of your skin you don't and
we love this again it is expensive but I
have purchased this already and then I'm
gonna have to purchase another one very
soon because I'm almost done with this
one as well
it really does hydrate the skin
beautifully and it feels amazing
underneath makeup it doesn't feel heavy
at all it's just my favorite it's my
favorite and it doesn't break me out
doesn't make my redness look even more
intense it's just the best so for a
nighttime eye cream I love the la
Prairie cellular radiance eye cream this
just hydrates this out of my under
eye area you guys like when I go for
night time I do like something a little
bit thicker this is definitely more of a
thick eye cream I wouldn't necessarily
use this during the day I have used it
during the day before just because I
didn't really have anything for daytime
but this one is definitely a night cream
you can see again I'm running out of
this so my next skincare purchases is
gonna be ridiculous I'm going to be
spending a lot of damn money I have
noticed between this one and my daytime
cream I don't have a ton of little fine
lines like I used to I mean obviously I
do have some right underneath here and
my lashes but I don't have any like
right down here anymore I think they
were just like dehydration lines or
something cuz now they're filled in and
it's smooth I feel like it kind of
plumps up my under eye a little bit as
well and I can feel the moisture
underneath my eye then
next morning okay and then for my
nighttime moisturizer this is e la
Prairie cellular Swiss ice crystal in
uljin and I love this because again it's
very very very hydrating it's thicker
than my regular moisturizer but it's not
too thick where it breaks me out because
I find that if a moisturizer is really
thick on me I just start breaking out I
don't know what the deal is but I think
it's just I don't know what what happens
it's just too much I guess it's very
very hydrating again I can feel this
until the next day and it calms down my
redness which I enjoy this is a really
nice bottle honestly it last you forever
I just had to purchase another one
because I ran out of my first one that
lasted me a while I really love this
stuff I think skincare is so important
especially if you have problematic skin
so it works for you is worth it because
in the long run it's going to make your
skin look better and your makeup looks
better everything she's better and then
you know what I mean top mask of the
year nothing seems to ever top this mask
for me is the glam glow super mud
clearing treatment I can't remember if I
mentioned this last year but it is so
good oh my gosh if you have acne prone
skin this will clear up your acne in a
couple days now what I do is if I have a
really bad breakout normally that
happens around my cycle
mother nature comes to town she's like
you start breaking out and then I put
this on so what will happen is I usually
break out around this area what I'll do
is I will just paint this all over my
face for the next wait like two or three
days I'll put it on every single day
leave it on until it's dry wash it off
and I swear to you they are gone they're
usually diminished a lot after the first
night but the second night they are good
to go because on that third day when I
wake up I'm like wow my skin looks so
much better this is one mask that I'm
like oh my gosh I see the difference I
can see it in a couple days it's just so
good also have to shout out my self
tanner loving tan I love the eight-hour
one in ultra dark I think it's the best
it's so dark I need to read tan myself
if you want to see a difference this is
the before this isn't after I didn't
blend my self-tanner very well but it's
a very very dark self-tanner I've had
this on for about a week or so - dry
quickly gives you a really great color
and you have a color guard so you're
going to be able to see where you put it
I do have a coupon code for this
well I personally love the eight-hour
one just because it is the darkest you
do have a two-hour one as well if you
don't want to wait eight hours that
one's really great also in dark I
believe okay let's move on to make a
favorites the first thing I'm going to
talk about is my favorite brushes these
are just two standout brushes I have
purchased that I think are amazing and a
hundred percent worth the money so first
one is the Sephora Pro contour number 79
this is my favorite favorite brush for
highlighter I just feel like it's the
perfect size to apply a highlighter to
the tops of my cheeks I feel like it
grabs all the product really well and it
lays the product down beautifully as
well as just a nice smooth application
and you don't have any chopping lines
it's easy to apply it and then blend it
out I just love it you could use it for
your contour if you wanted to but
personally I use it as my highlighting
brush this is a Sephora Pro brow in
number 20 now I was using a Tarte brow
brush for the longest time and then my
spoolie came off of it and I went to
storage try to buy more and I guess
it'll sell that Tarte dual brow brush
anymore because I could not find it for
the longest time so I caved and I got
this a 4-1 and I'm obsessed with it the
brush is the perfect shape for me it has
the perfect amount of bristles in it
it's nice and tightly packed but it's
not too packed and I feel like it just
puts the product down really nicely as
well sometimes you can get a brow brush
and it'll just kind of make your brows
look streaky because it doesn't really
apply it very well and press it back
there onto the skin I cannot have an
eyebrow brush without spoolie on the end
like I can't function like that because
I'm always like this and then I run it
through you know what I mean it's just a
all-in-one things that love this this is
definitely taking the cake for me and
I'm so happy I found it let's stick with
the tools one more time I have one more
tool to let you guys know about and it
is the japonesque sponge
I love the Pro Beauty Blender but if you
don't want to spend the extra few
dollars to get it I highly recommend
this they do have a set with a smaller
sponge and a cleaner for I think it's
around $18 so it's awesome I really like
it it's very very similar to the Pro
Beauty Blender you just want to save
some money I highly recommend this
because it is a phenomenal have a link
down below because I believe it's only
on
okay so let's get started with how you
apply stuff to your face so let's start
with primers this is not going to be any
surprise to you guys if you've been
watching me for a while these are my two
favorite primers so this one is the
Smashbox primer water I'm obsessed with
it I've gone through multiple multiple
bottles of this I just can't get enough
of it even if you have oily skin I feel
like it's very very important to keep
your skin hydrated it's just going to
help try to balance everything out and I
feel like this hydrates my skin very
well and also primed and I actually
noticed a difference when I don't use
this product with my other primers and
then I go in with a kind of I guess you
would call it problematic primer so for
my problematic areas I use this so this
is the canaan austin mattifying a primer
and it has SPF 50 and it has green tea
vitamin C and all this other stuff but
look at this I use the crap out of it
first off it does have a tint to it so
it neutralizes my redness very very well
I could put this on in some powder and I
would be fine
throughout the day if I wanted to run
errands but I love that underneath
foundation because it adds a little bit
of extra coverage so your foundation
doesn't have to do all of the work if
you wanted to go in with a medium
coverage foundation you totally could
after putting this on because it just
neutralizes a lot of that remnant and I
love this because it fills in pores it
does keep me matte and it is a smooth
primer it's like a all-in-one product
for me it's amazing I love this to death
I can't be without it okay moving on to
foundations I have a couple so the first
one is these Smashbox Studios skin 15
hour where foundation I was using this
for months
constantly because I just love it so
maybe in the full coverage finish it has
a natural look to the skin and it looks
good in all forms of light that's what
it was formulated for and I just think
it's amazing it looks like skin but
again you can build it up from medium to
full coverage so if I want to do a
medium coverage I'll just go in one time
with a beauty sponge and I'll be fine
but then if I want a little extra
coverage I'll just go right here on top
of my cheeks just a little bit more
where I have a little extra redness and
it covers it right up because sometimes
my redness will peek through the primer
or something depending on how its acting
up for the day I can just apply a little
extra product on top of that and it'll
be full coverage I just like the way it
looks I love the way it wears it lasts
all day long on me even in the hot
son it's just amazing next up is a new
favorite but I had to mention it this is
a Sonia Kashuk a soft focus satin matte
foundation oh my gosh you guys I found
this at the end of the year but I love
it it's drugstore kinda you can find it
at Target
I consider it drugstore this is in the
drugstore check section why do I do that
every single time this is in the
drugstore section at Target I consider a
drugstore I think this is the most
beautiful bottle ever from the drugstore
I mean honestly I think it's around $14
this does have a little less than one
ounce is point 88 ounces but for me this
is such a beautiful coverage foundation
it is so lightweight this is lighter
than the Smashbox once Oh like you can
barely feel it on your skin and it is
full coverage the only thing that sucks
about it is their shade range they do
not have a lot of shades which blows I
feel like Sonia Kashuk never has a lot
of shades in their collections but if
you can't find your shade I highly
recommend it it's a satin matte finish
exactly what I said it blurs out your
pores and keeps you looking amazing all
day long so for concealer this is like a
broken record
the Tarte chick tape concealer is by far
the best this has been the best
concealer hands-down this year they just
killed it with making it full coverage
it's lightweight it doesn't dry your
under eyes it doesn't crease it is the
best I have recommended this to
absolutely everyone I have a few more
concealers that I love like the smashbox
24-hour one the Maybelline fit me
concealer but this one is by far like
the one that I have to use on my eyes to
cover the darkness right in here okay
let's talk about powder you already know
my favorite powder this year it's a
flower beauty powder in this is the
shade lo1 now I want to discuss
something real quick with you guys
because there's some confusion about
which one I'm using I'm just using the
loose powder this does have a shade to
it I have already gone through one jar
of this which is insane but you can see
the shade right there there's this one a
lot of people think I'm using the matte
one I don't like this one and I'll
mention that and probably my January
hits and misses because I'll just have
to explain it all there
but this is not the one that I like I
like the one with a shade it's the one
with a shiny top Nazi matte top so I
just wanted to quickly discuss that one
quick but I will let you guys know in my
January hits and misses why I don't like
that but this is awesome oh my gosh to
bake your face with it really just makes
your face look flawless and it looks
good over any foundation and it adds a
little bit extra coverage since it's
tinted and it's affordable it's from the
drugstore you can't beat this product
like it is so damn good it beat $100
pattern that I tried this year you guys
that's how it won me over so I love it
highly recommend it you get a lot of
products you get a sifter okay let's
move on I want to quickly mention the
brow product that I used constantly ever
since it launched it is the benefit
Cobra in number three I really really
like this product it lasts in my brows
all day long it's so easy to work with
the shade number three is my perfect
shade I love it and this is so cute it's
compact and it's just one of my favorite
colors and it's easy to blend just so
easy to work with and I use it
constantly so the benefit ku brow is my
winner for brows this year also really
quickly if your oily you're gonna love
these Palladio rice papers the best
thing ever so first off all you do you
open it up you can just take a wadding
sheet one side is like this which is
just basic and a plain boil sheet but
this side has powder on it you know what
that means
you can blot and powder all at the same
time isn't it a beautiful thing so this
is just amazing because literally you
can just press it on your skin I did
this actually before filming so you're
probably not going to see much on this
but you don't have to add powder on top
of it that is what's so amazing about it
it just sucks up that oil and then it
adds powder at the same time so there's
some oil that's how oily I am you guys
like can you believe that I feel I did
this before I started filming keep these
in my purse with me constantly
especially in the summertime this is my
go-to product okay so moving on to
bronzers a lot of the stuff coming up
now is drugstore - like eyeshadows and
stuff like that which I will mention
after bronzers because I forgot to
mention eye products after I mentioned
some face products I will get onto the
eye products that are a little bit more
pricey but for bronzers this year these
two are my favorite this one is like
hands-down my favorite
this one I love to contour with so oh I
just broke it oh I literally it was so
close to hitting pan that it was just
like not today ladies so this is the
Neutrogena healthy skin blends natural
radiance bronzer in 30 sunkissed so you
can see how much I've used a product you
see how thin it is on the pan I mean I
love it I love it I love it I love it so
obviously I'm gonna have to purchase
another one but this is probably the
most natural I should probably not slime
that this is the most natural looking
bronzer that I have found it's just a
beautiful golden tan color has a little
bit of red it's a little bit ashy it's
that perfect in-between shade that is
just so beautiful to bronze all over the
face with and also contour with so
highly recommend this oh so good and
then to contour this Physicians Formula
multi color bronzer is amazing I think
it's a great bronzer you can mix
different shades to get a different
color you can get a lighter shade you
can get a dark color just a contour with
it blends out really well
Packaging is very bulky that's just
Physicians Formula but I really do like
the shade of this because it's a little
bit more ashy
okay moving on to blush there's one
blush that just stands out to me and
that is the tarte blush in risque this
is just the perfect blush for any any
look every single day I had to literally
put this away because when I was filming
videos I would just reach for this with
any any look that I did and when it came
to hits and misses I was like oh crap I
don't have a blush because I've been
using this every single time I can get
away from it so I love this color the
Amazonian clay blushes are amazing they
last for a really long time they're very
smooth they're creamy they look
beautiful on the face and then blend out
very well
risque is my favorite color this is by
far the blush for me from 2016
highlighter time okay I have one
highlighter from the drugstore that I
want to mention to you guys because this
one just like stole the show for me and
honestly when I think of a highlighter I
think of this one just because I know I
talked about it a shit-ton this year so
it's the wet and wild boozy brunch
highlighter look at it it's so nice
it's like a golden champagne color it's
just beautiful you guys I can't get away
from it it looks stunning on the cheeks
it's just beautiful that's it right
there if you love golden champagne e
highlights you're going to love this
don't be intimidated by the pink it
doesn't alter the color it just all of
it together it looks beautiful okay so
really quickly forward eye product I
want to mention the Too Faced glitter
glue i I don't know if I mentioned this
last year but if you're going to work
with glitter or very pigmented
eyeshadows I highly recommend laying
this down first because it's going to
grab that color and grab that eyeshadow
whatever you're putting on it's going to
keep it locked in all day and all night
this is something I have to have if I'm
doing a very smoky look something with
loose glitter or anything like that
because I know it'll work for me it's
not going to crease it's just gonna hold
everything onto your lids also still
love the NARS eyeshadow primer it's the
best of the best you guys if you have
oily eyelids the NARS smudge proof
eyeshadow base is all you need in your
life it's the best moving on i shadow
palettes these are high in so I'm sorry
about that and one is just like a really
high-end I just love it so much so the
first one is the Urban Decay Naked
ultimate basics palette this is it
oh god Lorber this is exactly what it
says it is the ultimate Naked basics
palette it's just perfect has all your
basic shades in here anything you need
from like a light yellow cream shade to
a nice matte black I love this I love
matte colors so this is kind of like a
palette for me because I love these kind
of shades and my mirror did fall out so
boo to that but I really do love this
product I think the packaging is
beautiful the mirror could have been a
little better but you know you'll win
some you lose some
this is one of those palettes that I can
just toss in my makeup bag travel with
it and I could have a shimmery eyeshadow
or the next palette I'm about to show
you and I'm gonna have every color that
I need and then for the hunker of this
whole thing this is a Natasha de Nona
green Brown palette I love this palette
you guys I know it's expensive but I
mean honestly it's beautiful I bought it
with my own money this is just so
stunning I love all the colors in this
and you know when I first got it I
thought I wouldn't use like this coat
right here or this color and I ended up
using almost all these colors so far
ever since I purchased this I've just
been using them constantly this is a
winner for me love it love this shade
love this shade I love I love all these
colors and this makes me want to
experiment with these shades
Natacha and ona green Brown palette it's
amazing it has a mirror has a little
film over the eyeshadows so you don't
have to get the mirror dirty it's just
awesome so my favorite mascara for the
year has definitely been benefit roller
lash this mascara is great at getting
all your lashes not clumping them it
doesn't flake just really love it it
really makes your lashes just look
pretty and long and fluffy I don't know
I love it so much and I just continue to
use it love it and call it my favorite
so the benefit roller lash is awesome
and then you guys know I got to talk
about false lashes so these are amazing
and you know what made these the eye
lash of the year for me is because
they're affordable these are the eye
lower luxe gilded lashes they are very
fluffy they're very full if you've tried
eyelure before and hate the band this is
completely different the band is thinner
easier to work with a look like mink
lashes but they're not I've not had a
chance to get my hands on the vlogger
series yet but I really need to because
those girls came out with some amazing
lashes ok and then you won't believe it
but I literally only have two more
products to share with you that are lip
products first one is like a brand lip
product these are the Palladio lip
liners these have been my favorite lip
liners all year amazing they're creamy
they could be a lip color on their own
favorite colors have been gingerbread
and also Cabernet this is gingerbread
beautiful and then this one is Cabernet
right there that's Cabernet so love
these colors they're beautiful again
like I said they're very creamy they're
affordable they're Ulta just I love that
brand then for lipstick there is only
one brand that I feel like I should talk
about because I have talked about them
constantly said that they're my favorite
liquid lipstick of all time and they
still are at that number one spot
they've got some that are right
underneath them like the Sephora cream
lip stains it is these Smashbox liquid
lipsticks this is one of my favorite
colors right here this is in the shade
babe alert guys these just look so good
on
lips they're so pigmented they feel good
they look good for a long period of time
they don't crack on your lips or
anything like that they're just so good
the shade range is beautiful I honestly
just don't have anything bad to say
about them the dosa applicator is
perfect you can see right there that it
holds product in the center so when you
apply it to your lips you don't have to
keep dipping into the tube to get more
product because you have enough product
on the lawn or just so comfortable and I
can't say enough good things about it so
those are all my 2016 Beauty favorites
again I cannot believe we're in 2017 but
I'm so excited to start this year crank
it out get some awesome products out and
try new things to share with you guys so
