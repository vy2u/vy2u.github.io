a first impression on a mascara
it's the Too Faced better than sex
mascara and I know this one's been
around for a while but I haven't tried
it out and around Christmas time I did
purchase this little set and I've just
been really interested in trying it out
I think this was like $10 on Sephora
when they were having their like little
sales so this little kit comes with the
better than sex mascara sample and then
the Too Faced perfect eyes waterproof
eyeliner I did open it up and try the
eyeliner and so far I'm really liking it
it was super super creamy but I leave
like a little description in the
description bar if it ran if it's
smudged everywhere so I'm just look in
the description bar below if you want to
see what I thought of this later on I
haven't opened this yet it's the Too
Faced better than sex mascara first
impression of this liner wasn't it was
great it's really smooth very very
pigmented
and hopefully this doesn't run I have a
problem if liners are too creamy they
will run out here on the corners of my
eye and the inner corners is just a mess
so yeah I'm going to go ahead and assume
you guys in so we can put this mascara
on okay so I told you guys I applied the
liner to my top lashes and I also
applied it to in my bottom lashes and
here's a close-up of the wand so you
guys can see what I'm talking about
where it is smaller in the middle I did
call my lashes I always call them so I
felt like I just needed to do it but
let's just go ahead and get started
first off to it is kind of goopy you can
see it on the one I just feel like it's
a little too too goofy I don't know if
that's just because the sample like look
at the little tube I don't know if it's
because the sample or what but it's a
little goofy so far sorry if I'm
sniffling I'm I've been kind of having
like the sniffles and stick a little bit
so I'm sorry
okay so let's apply one coat
okay so that's the first application I'm
doing so far I really like it like look
at that volume like that looks really
nice so yeah that's awesome I think this
will be the kind of mascara that does
get clumpy it very very quickly if you
are not careful I am going to do a
second application just for the purpose
of this video because it is a first
impression so you know if it messes up
it messes up but it's good to see how it
goes on if you do multiple coats of
mascara so so far I really do like it I
could get away with just this coat and
be done I think it's really really nice
you can see especially with the liner on
the bottom it looks really nice and full
out here and I absolutely love mascaras
that do that okay so we're going to do
this again go in for our second
application
okay so that's the second as you can see
it's a little clumpy which I kind of
expected when this mascara since it was
already kind of full and goopy in the
beginning I know some people like this
kind of look some people don't
personally I don't like the way it looks
so I will go in with a more rubberized
one to really separate these lashes but
I have to say the volume is there I mean
it looks really nice I don't feel like
you need false lashes with this mascara
take my covergirl LashBlast volume this
has more of a rubberized wand so it's
really going to help separate these
lashes I think once you get them
separated it's going to look really
really nice see simple as that
another really great mascara to separate
lashes and things is the covergirl lash
perfection I used to use that all the
time
loved that mascara I just haven't picked
it up in a long time obviously I would
stick with one coat of this mascara
unless you liked this look I know some
people have different preferences with
mascara and that's totally fine it's up
to you however you want to apply your
mascara so I'm kind of nervous to try as
necessary on the bottom lashes just
because it's such a big wand so we'll
see okay it was actually pretty simple
to get the bottom lashes you just barely
have to touch your bottom lashes with it
and you'll be fine so this is one thing
my scar looks like two applications on
top and one barely not even one
application on the bottom so yeah let me
put on this mascara on the other eye and
I'll be right back to give you guys the
conclusion on the mascara okay so I just
applied it to this eye and I have to say
I really really really like it this I
did get is comfy as this side that
usually happens with my lashes this size
usually a pain but this is always like
the good girl I have to say I really
really like this mascara the volume is
intense I think you know it is clumpy
but if you're careful with it it'll be
okay you can separate your lashes you
can even take like
eyebrow comb and comb through your
lashes just to get any extra product
that's really bothering you
I recommend that over tweezers because
eyes use tweezers to kind of separate my
lashes and it's kind of danger so
definitely take a lash comb and brush
through the lashes but I think this
might be my next high-end mascara
purchase it's just really nice I like
the way it looks and a little bit of
clumps okay when it gets a little too
clumpy like I showed you in the demo
that's when you know you got to go in
with something with a rubberized brush
and just separate them really well so I
get this one a thumbs up I think it's
great I think you should definitely try
it out you can get a sample of it or if
you want to purchase it I think it's
absolutely amazing if you're looking for
intense volume something that's going to
be like BAM in your face so I hope you
