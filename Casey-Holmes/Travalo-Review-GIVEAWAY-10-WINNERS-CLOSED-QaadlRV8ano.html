on my travel owes its going to be a
review and a giveaway so if you're
interested in the give way please stay
tuned to the end so I wasn't these four
of you but of course everything is my
honest opinion I wouldn't tell you guys
you know something's good if it's not
good these were the two that they sent
me I did show these in my April
favorites they just came in these little
tubes like this and it has a really nice
packaging says travel Oh on the front
and they just so really cute and you
open it up and you have your little
travel oh and of course you can see I
love the orange when the orange ones my
favorite but it says travel ooh on the
side then you have like the little end
where you insert your perfume and then
the top comes off and it's just a really
nice spray and these sprays are very
very nice they don't like just squirt
liquid out it actually is like a full
spray so I really really like that these
don't look cheap and they don't spray
like they're cheap that makes sense we
all know what I'm talking about so yeah
I really love it I have really no
complaints on it other than one thing
sometimes on the bottom it'll be a
little wet from the perfume I guess
because maybe like a drop will leak out
into right here but it's nothing like
you know oh my god it's leaking or
anything that's why I just keep them in
here so if it does kind of have a little
bit of leakage it's not going to come
out my person all that stuff so that's
the only thing I have to say about that
but otherwise these are amazing for
on-the-go and honestly I like to keep
these in my purse um because I mean the
body sprays that perfumed have like
they're nice but they don't last as long
as perfume so it's always nice to keep
your favorite perfumes on the go and
just touch up and you know freshen
yourself up throughout the day and have
it last longer than having to keep
spraying by spray on you so these are
great they're super lightweight and
they're just really adorable so I love
them really quickly I'm going to show
you how to put perfume in it you want to
have a perfume that the nozzle can come
off of where is it okay like this like
this little part can come off the
perfume some of them like you cannot
take it off I try for my choice taker
bombshell perfume and it just did not
come off
out some perfumes nozzles won't come off
with some do so you just want to make
sure that off and you take the bottom of
your travel oh and you stick it on top
and you basically just pump it into the
travel oh and then you'll just see the
liquid go up and you'll basically know
when you're done or if you don't want to
fill up how are full you don't have to
but it's super easy I mean after I do
that I kind of like white the bottom of
it because there's a little bit of
liquid on it these are the travel Oh
exhales I do believe they have quite a
bit of colors for these and they have a
lot more sprays to them so that's really
nice if you are interested in winning
one of these travel owes there's going
to be 10 winners so that's amazing all
you have to do is be a subscriber to me
go to travelers facebook and like them
and let them know that it's blondie sent
you and then what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to go over to their page and
randomly pick 10 winners and then I'll
