sharing with you some different products
that I've gone recently I feel like I've
gotten so many different products that I
don't even have enough time this month
to do like a bunch of personal questions
I still have some set aside for first
impressions and things like that but I
wanted to come on camera and do like a
first impression slash things I've tried
that I like and just share them all with
you guys because there's so much new
stuff out so much new stuff so I am
going to start with my face and priming
first no not right now okay I love you
but not right now
so the first thing I'm going to use
actually really love this I've used it
uh-uh-uhh bound it wing so this is one
product that I've used a few times and I
really really love it it's the
Porefessional matte rescue and this is
like a gel primer this is amazing oh
nothing it almost this is actually a
primer it just says invisible finish
mattifying gel and it just says to apply
actor like clean dry skin so I count it
as a primer but I just put all this all
over my face and first off it smells so
good and not only that it feels so
amazing it's not drying whatsoever but
once it sets into the skin and you put
your foundation on it is like heaven I
put my Marc Jacobs foundation on top of
this and I was like oh my god actually I
think I put this down and then my
Smashbox primer is too so sometimes I
use this as a moisturizer sometimes I
use it with everything it's been a while
since I've applied my moisturizer so I
went ahead and applied this but you
could feel it drying and it's amazing
and I just I really really love it I
think it makes a huge difference in my
foundation going on really smoothly and
it's great if you have oily skin I think
this controls your oil so well it's
amazing I'm just going to apply my
regular primers the Smashbox pore
minimizer and primer watch her so now
going in with this I've not tried it yet
this is a mac matchmaster shade
intelligent compact and 3.0 I think this
colors going to be good for me I did
take off the seal that was on it but I
haven't put on my face so this is like
the
of the compacts that are coming out
lately the cushion foundations that's
what this is so you just open it up and
then you pop this guy open and you have
the color
I don't know if that color is going to
match me but we will see it looks a
little more more warm but we'll see so
I'm not going to use these I don't like
these sponges just just my personal
preference so I'm going to use my Beauty
Blender and just tap it and they're
tapped in there once not a lot of
product so looking a little warm but we
can make it work I'm not going anywhere
today anyways ok so first impression is
it's really light coverage like lighter
than L'Oreal Lumi in my opinion super
light like way lighter than L'Oreal Lumi
um because I could still see a lot of
redness but it does cover up quite a bit
sorry this colors not going to work but
hopefully concealer will help oh not
really digging it right now for my first
impression of it I'm going to see if I
can build it up but what it does for me
is it color matches me a little bit
better to my neck obviously it's not
perfect but it doesn't cover up my
problem areas which is what I care about
the most
because when you have rosacea or acne
prone skin you don't necessarily want
something that's not going to cover up
especially you spend money on this I
can't remember how much it is but I'll
leave it somewhere in here but it's not
cheap so um this would be like my
natural tan shade probably but not my
fake tan my fake tan is more yellow
toned but I'm gonna try to build it up
and see mmm doesn't build up really well
like it looks like it's kind of rubbing
away more foundation as I build it up
oh my god oh this table doesn't make
anything any better it's like let's show
the rest of your body and how yellow it
is oh sorry guys so um Burt well I just
I'm probably in returnees honestly I
don't really think I'm gonna try this
out again
but so far I don't like this I don't
like the coverage maybe if you had
really great skin and you just wanted
something light you would like this but
to me the L'Oreal True Match um the one
that comes like this I did a video on it
it was like my foundation routine I'll
link it down below I like that so much
better than this already like I just
think it's better I feel like I have a
really hard time finding a good color
match at Mac and these shades when I was
looking at them they were kind of weird
and there just wasn't a good selection
in my opinion so I would give the
L'Oreal want to go before you tried this
without because the L'Oreal one
definitely has way better coverage but
since I'm Orange now I'm going to take
my concealer this is a steal of aqua
glow steer and concealer I really like
this this isn't light medium and first I
like the packaging of it because it's so
different and it's a squeezy tube so
that's awesome
but I like this because it's a very
light weight concealer and it feels so
hydrating under the eyes I do find that
it creases just a little bit but it's
nothing like disgustingly gross in my
opinion um I just have to really set it
in place
since it is like kind of hydrating and
just looks really good on the skin it
kind of gives like a nice glow I use
this concealer when I was in New York
and I loved it it lasted all day long
one day we had gotten up early to go
like do things around the city and I use
this concealer my Marc Jacobs foundation
and then we went back and I got ready I
didn't change my makeup or anything I
just I had the same base I just hadn't
done my eyes so since I had my face
already done I just need to do my eyes
and like a false lashes and stuff
because I didn't have time to get fully
ready and this concealer in the Marc
ticket Sunday foundation lasted all
throughout the night like till 4:30 a.m.
because we went out to a club and I was
like oh my god I'm
Neriah issue with this conceal like
breaking up line nose but this
foundation is making it break up and
it's driving or it's like sticking to
different parts of the foundation which
is not cool so I'm not gonna bronze
because I'm pretty warm right now I'm
gonna try this out those the Charlotte
Tilbury film-star bronze &amp;amp; Glow face
sculpt and highlight I wanted to try
this for forever for ever so that's what
we're doing I'm going to take this shade
right here and contour with it
I'm just going to use this Sonia Kashuk
brush because I like it it's a pretty
color it's like a little warm oh I like
that it has a nice shadow to it I like
this this bronzer or the sculpting
powder I like this I think I like this
even better than the Mac one that I was
using so contours nice I actually really
like that shade I like this shadow that
it gives to my face so that's awesome
and now I'm going to take a blush this
is just Mac alpine bronze my thing broke
when I dropped it this weekend but I
love this blush it's not a permanent
blush from Matt right now I can't tell
the difference between blush and my bra
or my rosacea foundations horrible so
let's just a highlight side of it so
does have this highlight shade right
here which looks like my kind of color
so I'm going to take this brush I'm
gonna take this morphe 5 to 8 I'm just
gonna pop down to help my cheek bone
holy SH oh wow an expected to be that
pigmented but now I know
Wow especially on this side so highlight
contouring is done now I'm going to move
on to brows I'm going to use the this is
a new Smashbox item it's the smashbox
brow tech shaping powder and basically
it says this micro-fine loose powder
shapes and adds volume to create natural
or bold brows our unique precision
precision applicator fills in space
areas and mimics natural hairs tap wand
to remove excess powder start at the
center of the rather to find the arch
and then apply in
direction of the hair growth to fill in
shape for more intensity sweet brow with
side up applicator let's try this out
first I need to brush my brows out says
to tap off the powder it looks like this
you guys see it so cool and then I'm
just gonna
very intense art oh this videos not
going out expected I think if you like
the more natural brow you would like
this I definitely need to touch up a
concealer but it is not my fave I'm
sorry Smashbox maybe to use like
throughout the day and I keep in your
purse to fill in areas that are getting
sparse but even then you should probably
be using something that lasts a little
bit longer oh my god my foundation looks
so right
are you sure Sephora has something like
this to like the spells going a little
bit easier so far probably because I'm
right-handed anyway so I feel like I
like the idea of it but just not for me
takes too much work this brows not
terrible that does look like real hairs
right there I find really cool okay so
for that I wouldn't necessarily
recommend it's not my favorite but you
might like it depending on what kind of
bra you want if you want if you already
have like really nice thick brows I
think you would like that but if you're
like me and you kind of like to reshape
them a little bit it takes a little more
time but I'll try it out a little bit
more and see how I like it because this
brow is okay my god I can work with it I
could do a little bit more filling in
here but it looks like a natural brow it
really does so I don't hate it but I'm
going to try it out just a little bit
more even though it does take more time
it's a different product so I'm gonna
have to get used to it
so let me try that out a little bit more
I will update you a little bit later but
that just kind of shows you first
impression like how it works
and now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to put on some lip liner and this
lip liner from the Urban Decay Gwen
Stefani collection is really good it's
called ex-girlfriend and then I'm going
to take a new you guys can't see I'm
going to take a new lipstick I have all
these Smashbox ones back here they did
send these to me and I really liked them
but I'm going to take I'm gonna take
coffee run calmer and looks like a
pretty ball lipstick so this is their be
legendary lipstick I think it's from
their matte collection I don't know um
but again it's a coffee
like a dark color good dark brown like a
chestnut brown beautiful eye you know as
I'm about to put this on I just realized
my lip liner totally does not work with
this okay I'm guessing this is not their
matte lip color because it's definitely
not mad
so that's okay because we can try out
their Instamatic I've never used this
before but it's the post to let me read
the back it says give your lipstick and
that makeover instantly the gel
transformed any cream lipstick into a
comfortable matte finish apply
generously over cream lipstick using
finger until a matte look is achieved
not not for use with glosses lacquers
for fall really nice packaging let me
just say that gorge let me put on my
finger just Pat ah shut up this color
and matte is gorgeous
okay you guys it works cool that's
awesome you guys like I love this lip
color and for it to be matte now I love
that they can't with something like this
that's so different and very cool it's
like a creamy matte shade it's not shiny
at all okay so the brand-new products I
have tried in this video were the mac
matchmaster intelligent compact
the charlotte tilbury highlight and
contour palette these smashbox brow
shaping powder and then the insta matte
from Smashbox I love these two after
trying them on I think they're great I
think they're going to be staples with
me I'm really impressed by this I think
it's freaking like magic I love it and I
love this the contour shade and the
highlights really pretty even though I
have a foundation that doesn't really
let you see that so I love those two off
the bat the Smashbox shaping powder is
something I'm gonna have to try out and
let you guys know because I do like the
effect that it gives and I like the idea
but it just takes a little bit longer
and I feel like it's going to require
more practice so I'll probably include
it in another tutorial or just something
like that I don't absolutely hate it I
just think it's something I have to try
a little bit more and then for for the
thing
I really just don't like it's the mac
matchmaster foundation I just don't like
it go save yourself some money and buy
the Loreal one yeah the other things I
showed you I do like and I've tried a
few times and I just want to incorporate
them in this video and talk to you
