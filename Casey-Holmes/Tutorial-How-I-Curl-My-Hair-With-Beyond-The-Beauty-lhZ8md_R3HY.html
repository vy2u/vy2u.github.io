to be on this curly kind of loose wave
hair I've gotten a lot of requests for
it I've been wearing it quite a bit in
my recent videos because I've been
trying out some different curling irons
in my haul I did get the new me
but I also was sent this from beyond the
beanie calm and this is the one I've
been using the most I better turn off
the price is expensive but compared to
what the newbie ones like this is
cheaper than the new me on the new me
site on sale so it's like 1:45 I think
at beyond the video calm their website
is seriously amazing it is so nice I
really recommend this curling wand it is
the 25 millimeter which is just an inch
I've never had a clipless curling iron
before this one and the new me ones the
only ones I have this one and the new me
is very similar they both have a swivel
cord they both just have like the basic
kind of on and off switch and stuff but
I feel like this one gets a lot hotter
than the new me one and it's just a lot
quicker to curl your hair um took me
about 20 minutes to do this this is the
packaging for I think it's so cute has
like just some girl on it it says
curling more iron or whatever pretty
sure the flags are the only places they
shipped to so those are the places this
one leaves my hair just like a lot
shinier looks healthier after I curl
with this wand with the new me one it
doesn't look as healthy as my hair does
now and I just love the results of this
I love this curling iron I've been using
it a lot more than the new me when I
purchased they wanted to give one of my
subscribers 75% off which is great you
could pretty much buy one of these for
the price that I got the new me at
Marshalls in one of my hauls so I will
leave all the info down below on how you
can enter they will be picking the
winner so it's gonna be completely fair
I hope you guys enjoyed this little
tutorial I definitely recommend checking
out the site they have a bunch of
different things like flat irons curling
irons I have seen reviews on their flat
irons and then they've gotten really
really great reviews as well so I
recommend checking this side out the
link will be below as always if you
don't want to purchase that curling yar
I just hope you enjoyed this tutorial if
you have just a regular clipless one
super easy to do it's just it takes you
know just a few minutes I guess then
you're pretty much stuck so I hope you
guys enjoy this don't forget to check
out the bottom where you can see if you
can where you can enter for the site in
fiber stay off and I will see you all in
my next video bye hey guys so I'm just
gonna start off by spraying all over I
got to be guardian angel just use any
heat protection that you prefer you know
anyone that works for your specific hair
type I'm going to section my hair off in
two pieces I'm not big on sectioning it
from the bottom up that's just too much
work for me I'm gonna take my first
layer of hair this is part about an inch
thick and every single curl in this
video is gonna be away from my face I
don't like to alternate curls or
anything like that I just really like
them all to you away from my face
because they flow nicely and when they
fall I think they look really pretty so
I'm just gonna keep doing this and in a
few seconds I will fast forward it a
little bit faster just say what we can
get through this side of my head and
we're not here
all I'm doing here is just touching up a
couple places I feel like need to be
more curled and senior coming a little
bit I went ahead and do the other side
of my head just to save us some time so
same concepts curling away from the face
now for my bangs I'm very picky about I
don't like the whole thing to be
completely super cold like the rest of
my hair I just kind of like the ends to
be flared out just to go along with the
curl theme but I don't like them to be
super tight but of course it's your
personal preference if you like your
girls to be or your bangs to be super
curl then go for it so I'm just finger
combing my hair now and you also have
the option of using volumizing powders I
will show you two in a second that are
really really great so you can choose
from the rocky hair bombshell big hair
powder I talked about this a lot it's
more for like an everyday natural kind
of look and then a really awesome one is
the big sexy hair powder play this one's
more for like going out it's gonna give
you some serious serious volume but for
today I choose the suave touchable
finish hairspray and just sprayed it all
over my hair and that's pretty much it
you guys so I hope you enjoy that I'm
gonna go ahead and click talking now

see how you can enter to win 75% off and
I will see you all in my next video bye
