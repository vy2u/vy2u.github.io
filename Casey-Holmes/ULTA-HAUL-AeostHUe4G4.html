an alcohol and it's nothing too crazy I
just decided to go online and purchase
some things from them because they
haven't really ordered from Ulta in a
while and I just I don't know I had a
craving to buy some new things so the
first thing is a body product this is
from the body shop and I really wish I
would have gotten this in the little but
I think I was the body butter I think it
was but this is in coconut oh my god it
smells so good it's just a little
exfoliator and I think it was like $19
maybe I don't know I've got pull back
some benefit from ordering on there it's
like with a purchase of 30 or more you
got like that little bag thing so the
next thing I got is I repurchase my
macadamia deep repair mask I love this
stuff I mention it my hair care routine
if you haven't seen that video I will
link it down below this stuff is so
amazing it smells so freakin good oh I'm
so excited to finally have this back in
my hair routine a lot even asked me
about my hair and how I die and I will
be doing an a on how I dye my hair so
keep an eye out for that video okay next
we just have makeup products but can I
stress enough how excited I was for the
sample I usually get the mixed samples
or in a what is it I get like yeah I get
like the variety samples from Ulta when
it order online
this time it with perfume stuff and if
you watched my March favorites you know
that I absolutely love a wonderstruck
perfume and look what they sent it's a
freaking wonderstruck car freshener I
flipped out when I saw this I was just
so excited I was like
you're not wait to open this up put it
in my car and just not all the time if
you know where I can purchase these like
in bulk let me know ok let's move on to
makeup first thing I want to show you
guys is just nyx matte bronzer now we
did open these products because i wanted
to look at them because i'm curious i
did open it and really put you in the
packaging but this is what it looks like
and i got mine in medium yes and it is
kind of a little light but it'll be okay
just just bronze my face up so that's
what that looks like I think I'll be a
nice contour bronzing shade and I'm
really really excited to use that I've
heard really great things about it next
is from benefit this is the coralista
blush I've heard really great things
about this as well so I wanted to give
it a try has super super cute packaging
and it's just a really fancy stuff out
it's just a really pretty coral color so
that's that and the packaging like I
said it's just super cute I haven't
tried any box the blushes from benefit
but I have tried the like hoola benefit
bronzer which I love so I figured I'm
gonna try next I needed a new eyelash
curler so I got the Tarte
picture perfect eyelash curler and it
came with the lights camera lashes
sample so I'm excited to try that did I
get this out so that's what it looks
like just a nice little one hope it
curls really well but and then like I
said it did come with the lights camera
lashes like a sample of it so I'm
excited about those and then three more
things I did pick up the benefit hello
flawless powder I've heard really great
things about this as well and I want to
give it
I got mine and toasted beige this is
what the packaging looks like it's
really cute it just says hello flawless
on it and that's the powder you can see
it's really dark but this will match me
more in the summertime just as long as
I'm nice and tan and then the next thing
I got is from anastacio I'm stasium I
know though but I got the perfect brow
pencil her great things about this brand
for the brows so if you're gonna give it
a shot and this is in the color dark
brown so it just comes with a pencil and
a little spooley so I'll let you guys
know when I think about that and then
I've got these hearts high-performance
Enzoani and clay 12-hour blush this is
in frisky now if you know like shimmery
or glittery blushes and then you will
definitely not like this but I think
it's a really pretty color and I think
I'm gonna get a lot of use out of it so
it's kind of like a coral pink color and
like I said does have a lot of shimmer
in it but I think what you apply it to
the skin it won't be that bad cuz when I
put it on the back of my hand it's not
that bad but that's what it looks like
it's super super pigmented cute
packaging and yeah that's just what it
looks like so the last thing I got is
actually for you guys though if you
stayed till the end then but I figured I
would go ahead and give this away
because I do love it so much and I just
wanted to give something away to you
guys so I will be giving away the naked
basics palette this is a really great
palette what it has inside is just some
neutral colors and it's great for
everyday use great for traveling if you
travel a lot so this is what it looks
like I absolutely love it a ton of
