Ulta haul and I actually just got done
filming like a first impressions video
on this look and I didn't have my mic on
I'm Michael it's completely off for the
second half of the video and I'm super
depressed about it because that's where
you know all the face products were so
unfortunately I'm not going to upload
that video I just think it looks
unprofessional if I have it if I'm
talking in the first half and then voice
over in the other half while I'm talking
in the video I don't know to me it just
looks unprofessional yeah I think I want
to film this tutorial though because I
really like it and like the way that it
turned out and I did use the new Urban
Decay Naked ultimate basics palette this
thing you guys is so awesome I love this
palette so if you guys wanna see a
tutorial on this look let me know no I
did go to Ulta and I got the big bag I
don't know why I got the big bag I feel
like I didn't get that much stuff but I
guess I did so the first thing that I
have right here oh is another japonesque
khuddam or KU Midori collection I don't
know this is a brush from japonesque
I've mentioned this before it's a dupe
for the NARS one I don't know what that
NARS one is called because it has a
crazy name but I just wanted another one
because I use these for different things
so oh wait this is different this is
bigger hold on ooh
okay well nevermind this is completely
different this is a lot fatter a lot
more bristles hmmm good for bronzer like
I like this one for blush and bronzer
and all that but this one is like kind
of thicker I'm feeling from bronzer that
would be pretty much legit they are kind
of more expensive for drugstore brushes
but I really like them and I think when
I had went to Ulta this time japonesque
brushes were buy one get one half off so
I got another one this is the buffing
brush and this just looked really cute I
wanted to see how it would work for
foundations and stuff like that always
it's just a little nugget look at that
the little too forgiving for me for
foundation so I'll see what I can do
this work and then I dig it a new
eyelash curler which I've already been
using just throwing stuff everywhere
I love the one from Tarte so this is the
one that I always use and I just needed
a new one I purchased the Ulta
illuminating powder and I've never used
this before I've used the yellow powder
from Ulta and I love it too great like
banana powder to set your concealer with
if you don't want to bake we're gonna
try this out because I was super
impressed by that powder this is nice
this is kind of like a white gold
highlight you can see it right there
next up I did get another Tarte shaped
tape contour concealer I got the shade
medium I believe I have the shade
light/medium
yes and I just needed a darker shade for
when I'm a little bit tanner so there's
the two right there this one's medium
this one's light meeting and then I also
decided to pick up the Tarte
high-performance Naturals confidence
creamy powder foundation I'm trying to
find an alternative or dupe for the la
prairie powder foundation for you guys
even though I love this foundation I
totally think it's worth it I figured I
would try to find something that is kind
of either really close to it or maybe a
Duke so I figured I would try out a
bunch of different foundations this
one's the shade a medium tan honey and I
felt this oh it has a little sleeve make
today beautiful that's so cute
I like that it's kind of padded too
which is nice oh wait it's not padded
it's just a puff this is what the
compact looks like and then you open it
up and you have the powder foundation in
there so little light lighter than I
thought that's okay so we'll see how
that works I'm not going to put my
fingers in it yet I just wanted to test
it out maybe in a video or something and
see how well it works so I got two
shades I got the Shaytan honey and
medium tan honey so I should have a
shade with this powder foundation so
when I was in the drugstore section of
Ulta I saw my favorite lashes I swear
there to you I only see these once in a
blue moon and I love them they're the
Vegas nay flashes by I'll or and grand
glamour I picked up every single one of
these all that they had in stock I
snatched them up I know that's a little
bit greedy but honestly I I need these
in my life they're just really great
bold dramatic lashes from the drugstore
and I just love them so get some of
these they're amazing okay moving on I
did purchase the it cosmetics bye bye
redness I have not used this in such a
long time and I used to love this
product I think the reason why I got rid
of it is because it was old and I needed
to buy a new one and I just never bought
a new one so if you don't know this is a
color correcting product it's perfect
for if you have rosacea like if you have
severe redness like really intense
rosacea this will be your lifesaver you
can use this under foundation you can
use it by itself I have used it and I
did love it but I want to try it out
again and see if I love it just as much
as I used to so yeah that's the it
cosmetics almost is that you are
beautiful your it a sweet so yeah again
this is the it cosmetics bye bye redness
I also purchased the Ulta brow pomade
and I wanted to see if this was a dupe
for my higher-end pomades
they're just my favorite for my eyebrows
I find them so easy so I wanted to test
this one out since it is a drugstore
option I also got a lighter shade in the
dream matte mousse you guys saw this in
my trying new drugstore makeup and I
love this foundation I just needed a
shade lighter so I got the shade light
beige medium zero I think this might be
too light I think I needed the number
two but this is all I could find so I
figured I could mix and match with the
darker one that I have to get like my
perfect shade so I love this this is a
great foundation from the drugstore it
makes you look flawless so I got three
of these Palladio Velvet Matte
cream lip colors and I really like these
these are just a matte cream lip color
literally what they say this is not like
a liquid lips it worse and completely
dry down and be super matte throughout
the day this is just a really nice
creamy matte color easy to apply I love
it
so I've already worn this shade this is
the
shade raw silk and that's raw silk right
there
such a pretty everyday color then we
have the shade Mukul bo you see le I
don't know what that means
oh it's like a mob I thought this was
more pink I'm gonna love this shade so
again this is Bo UCL II ooh I like that
color a lot that is super pretty lot
prettier than I stopped gonna be and
then this is a really deep shade this is
called tapestry
it's a really deep burgundy color zoom
y'all that is like one and a half swipes
so excited to try all these colors out
like I said I have tried this one it
does dry down to more of a matte finish
but it is gonna be a little bit more
creamy on your lips it's not gonna be
like transfer-resistant or anything like
that and the next thing I got another
powder foundation this is a laura geller
double take baked a versatile powder
foundation and sand I felt this in store
and it just felt so amazing so again
this comes with a little puff and then
the compact looks like this I love that
you can see the color on the front of
the packaging and then that's what it
looks like and then you could place your
powder in there and you have a mirror
next up we have the makeup revolution
eyeshadow palette this is the essential
Max and this just looks so pretty I
really do love the makeup revolution
line I think it's amazing so I figure
don't try this out cuz I don't think
I've seen this in store whoo that's like
terrible swatching right there but these
feel awesome oh I just dug my nail and
that wow these are really really pretty
I have high hopes for this I have to do
an elf one brand makeup tutorial soon
because I purchased a bunch of stuff
from elf and I need to use it so I'm
gonna do that soon but then I think I'm
gonna do a drugstore matte fall makeup
look because even though this is a matte
look I think I'm gonna make this like a
higher-end one and then do a drugstore
one let me know you guys think because
this seems really promising and very
very nice like then the last thing I got
is this brush from it cosmetics I mainly
got this because I did not know if the
powder foundations actually came with a
puff
I probably should have checked that but
I didn't know so I went ahead and got
this brush but I figured I could use it
for other things as well number six flat
top buffing a foundation brush so this
feels really good I think this is going
to be nice or foundation even for like
the Maybelline Dream matte mousse
foundation I like flat tops like this
for it because I like to buff it in
really quickly okay guys so that is it I
know this is kind of a short and quick
Ulta haul but I figured I would just
share with you guys what I got and yeah
just keep a lookout for these products
I'm super excited to try them out for
you and let you know what I think thank
you guys so much for watching don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you
love hauls and let me know in the
comments like I said if you want to see
a tutorial on this look anyways that is
