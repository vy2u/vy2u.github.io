with you an Ulta haul I went to Ulta
honest to god to get one thing and I
came out with a big bag and look at this
receipt though so I did get a couple
high-end products but most of this stuff
is drugstore and I went in looking for
more like a drugstore eyeshadow brushes
and things like that but honestly I
couldn't find anything I liked so I'm
trying to improvise with my videos for
when I do drugstore makeup tutorials and
things like that that I use more
affordable tools as well but it's been
kind of hard so just bear with me I'm
trying to find like a good quality stuff
for you guys because I'm just like it's
it's hard brushes are like an important
part of makeup so anyways let's just
start with the reason why I went in here
and it lets to get a Real Techniques
Beauty Blender and I figured I would use
this instead of using the real Beauty
Blender when I do my drugstore makeup
looks and this was like a two-for-one
deal this was only $10.99 and I could
have sworn I paid for one Real
Techniques sponge when I first got this
like a year ago or so it was like $8.99
so you're pretty much getting like a
two-for-one deal and I did do a
comparison between this in the Beauty
Blender so I'll leave that video down
below if you want to check it out it's
really old but I did it for you if you
want to see it this though this I was so
excited about I was like um I literally
gasped in the false lash Isle these are
by Isle or London and it's the number
126 and these lashes they're described
as a completely gorgeous spiky lash in
sections great for defined and cool look
I was gonna wear these today and I was
like no hold on like I have I would just
want to say I have been trying to find
gorgeous false lashes for ever and I hit
the mother lode with this one and would
you just look at how gorgeous these are
they don't look overly fake or plastic
like honest
they are stunning they remind me so much
of girl you crazy lashes from velour I
can't wait to wear them it took
everything I had in me today tonight
wear these but I'm so excited about this
so let's just go ahead and talk about
the high-end products real quick I just
have like four things to show you I
think or three just three okay I only
have three things to show you first
thing is what I'm actually wearing right
now it is the Urban Decay skin
weightless complete coverage concealer I
got the color light neutral it is a
pretty light color I might have to go a
shade darker I don't know yet I want to
see but I absolutely love the packaging
of this little guy like it's so gorgeous
and I love the applicator of it as well
this is what it looks like right here I
so far today's the first time I use this
concealer and I absolutely love it I
think it looks flawless underneath the
eyes and it just gives like a really
nice airbrushed finish and it really
highlights underneath the eyes so I'm so
far a really big fan of this and I'm
excited too because I feel like it's
hard to find really good under-eye
concealers so yes I love this a lot so
far so yay for that and then I dig it
another concealer this one's a Laura
Kapoor affection concealer and I got
this one in the shade beige and it looks
like this
do a little squeezy tube and I'm excited
to try this out as well it's a oil-free
a full coverage concealer and this is
supposed to go like hand in hand with
perfection foundation but I'm not a big
fan of that foundation to be quite
honest with you
hopefully I love the concealer though so
I'm excited to try this one out and then
the last time product I got I'm pretty
sure when I was at the Tarte section
that said something about like pore
minimizing and wrinkle reducing I'm
pretty positive but it's these heart
high performance naturals smooth
operation smooth operator
Amazonian clay tinted pressed finishing
powder it's formulated without parabens
burro
oils plates try Coast lon oh Lord
it's just a lot of things that doesn't
have it
I really doesn't want to say I love the
packaging I love the fact that they
don't have like a different color right
here
I just I'm really enjoying it and it has
a mirror and then this is the shade a
medium like I said and I'm really
excited to try it out it's a really
smooth powder and I think it's gonna be
very very nice so yep I figured why not
I'm always down for trying out new
powders now moving on to all of the
amazing drug survives I didn't purchase
some stuff from the Ulta brand so I got
this for free which I'll show at the end
if you're interested but let's start
with essence the first thing I'm going
to talk about is a lip liner that I have
been using a non-stop and I wanted to
purchase a backup because I know I'm
about to wear mine out and it's gonna be
gone like I just got it a few weeks ago
and it's just getting smaller and
smaller this has been the star of the
show on my Instagram if you guys are
wondering this has been my little my
life
like I love it it is the essence lip
liner in a soft berry this is amazing
paired with my NYX matte lip cream I
forget the color of the NYX matte lip
cream but I'll leave it down below but
that and this together is a great dude
for Lolita not even kidding and this is
such a smooth creamy consistency I just
fill in my lips
all the way with it and then put the
mixed matte lip cream on top and it's
just perfection and it lasts forever so
essence lip liners are bomb you need to
try them out and that one is definitely
my favorite color and then while I was
there I was I saw this essence Sun Club
Burnett's matte bronzing powder so it's
a really big thing like this and it says
it's number Oh too sunny and I just
wanted to try it out because I like
trying new bronzers and this one is more
affordable and it is completely matte so
it'd be great to bronze with and I don't
think the packaging is like hideous I
actually kind of liked it
moving on to what I got from the Ulta
bring and this is the most exciting part
because I bought every single color -
one that was sold out and I want to do a
video on these like like a review and a
swatch video um because I haven't heard
anyone talk about these
and I'm just overly excited so this will
probably be my next video up because I'm
just like wanting to get on the ball
with it but these are the Ulta matte lip
creams and there are so I can't even
like there's so many shades I can't even
do this so they have so many different
shades like I'm obsessed of these I
can't wait to wear them I tried out the
tender one on my hand at the store which
is the darker nude and it was gorgeous
so thumbs up this video and leave a
comment below if you want me to do a
full lip swatch video and review with
these bad boys I mean I'm probably gonna
do it anyways but just confirm it with
me let me know if you want to see it the
colors are absolutely gorgeous the one
that I really wanted that was sold out
was like a dark vampy purple but I'll
get that later these are just so
stinking pretty that's why I'm nots
watching them for you in this video cuz
we're gonna save all that for a whole
nother video and then I also got these
foundations from Ulta these are the Ulta
dippy matte foundations I got the color
mocha and chestnut chestnut is the
darkest shade which kind of sucks
because if you're a darker skin they
don't have a shame for you that I saw so
this is what they look like
again there's a Dimi what is it Demi
matte foundations and it says
lightweight gel cream formula absorbs
oil it prevents shine like diffusing
pigments help to diminish the appearance
of fine lines and wrinkles and it's
really cool because it's just a little
pump like this so so far I love the
packaging one fluid ounce and yeah I'm
excited to try it out you guys know I
love about finish so we'll see how I
like those the last thing I got from
Ulta brand is in Ulta brow tint and deep
I wanted to see if this is a good dupe
for the benefit gimme brow so we will
see it has it's like literally the same
packaging as the benefit one you can see
that the one is super tiny so hopefully
I like that I just found like a bunch of
goodies in the holter brand and I was
super excited I still want the contour
kit from them I haven't been able to
find it and it's stressing me out like I
want that in my life is it bad that that
stresses me out probably like my
priorities are kind of messed up but I
really want that in my life
oh no this is the last thing I got from
the ultra brain actually they also had
like a nude lipstick collection and this
is the one I call my eye they didn't
have any testers but this one is number
two of 59 and oh yeah I love this I got
home and swatch this and I was like oh
perfect I did great so that's that color
right there it's like the perfect nude
for me I love the darker nudes and this
is just stunning and this also pops off
at the end and has color in it so I
don't really necessarily know what
that's for
but I thought that was pretty cool maybe
it was the tester I don't know I've got
four more things and again they're lip
products because I've just been obsessed
with lip products the first thing is
this L'Oreal Paris lip thing it doesn't
have like the name of what it is on it
but you're supposed to do this color
side first and then this stick next so
it's just a long-wear lip product and i
swatched it earlier and it's still on my
hand like it will not come off I've
tried so we'll just watch it in the same
place but that's the color I think it's
really really beautiful it's so
pigmented and I love the doe foot
applicator on this it's beautiful so I
can't wait to try this out obviously
it's supposed to be a long wearing lip
product I don't know the name of it but
I will definitely let you guys know how
I like it
like I don't even know the color name
it's just I don't know it's not on the
packaging then the next thing I got was
this NYX simply vamp lip cream in in a
word I don't know but it's just a little
chubby stick basically and it's a vampy
color and I was like oh hello gorgeous
so can't wait to pair that with a nice
lip liner and see how that turns out I
mean this is this is gorgeous I love
that and I've never seen these simply
vamp lip creams so let me know if you
guys have seen them I know a bunch of
people go to the NYX what do you call it
they go to the NYX parties like at IMATS
and stuff like that and they get these
free totes with a bunch of products in
them but I never get set anything from
NYX
so everything i buy i've had a little
issue with this people think i'm lying
everything I get from NYX is something
I've purchased so it's my honest opinion
don't worry and then I also got two lip
liners from the Pali Paula do line this
first one is called Cabernet this is
another like one of the trendy lip
colors so very nice creamy lip liner
it's a perfect mom nude right there oh
it's stunning it's stunning and it's so
creamy oh I love this and then I got
more of a nude shade and this one is
called Gingerbread and this one just
like looked right up my alley and I want
to try it out I'm actually really
surprised of how creamy these aren't
I've never heard anybody talk about them
so this one's in Gingerbread which this
one is still kind of that Mavi nude but
it's definitely more on the brown nude
side so that's it right there you can
see it I love it I can't wait to play
with it so those are all the things I
purchased and like I said I dated this
free little bag from Ulta for purchasing
so much stuff from Ulta I'll quickly
show you what's in it I mean there's a
ton of stuff in this little guy and this
is so cute it has like little Rose
thingies on it like 3d roses you know
it's really cute
so hello come here the first thing we
got is a mini nail polish which is
adorable and it's like the perfect color
for summer it's in the color peach
parfait you also get this brow product
it has a brow wax and two brow powders
on the inside this is in the shade
medium I'm really excited to try this
out it looks really cool I love how it's
like a two on one type of thing
you also get an eyeshadow which is a
mineralized eyeshadow in the color
yellow so yellow Ulta yellow you also
get this Ulta amped lashes volume and
define mascara which is always good to
have mascaras I always use them even if
they stopped like I used them before I
put on false lashes I just don't really
care what kind I use Oh
get three quads you get one that's more
blue and silver toned you get one that's
more earth toned and then you get more
Purple's so they kind of that's cool
that they kind of just like covered all
the colors I like that a lot and then oh
you also get a five dollar off coupon
off of any other brand cosmetics that's
cool I'm going to use that and then you
also get a blush bronzer this I really
wanted to try in the store but I did it
I'm so happy it's in here because I want
to see what the formulas like it's an
Ulta butter bomb lip gloss in the shade
sub Malina and I think that's just
gorgeous it's gonna be pretty for spring
but I'm super excited to see what the
formulas like because if it's good I'll
definitely go back and get more you also
get this ultimate crayon and the shade
oh oh I don't know that's what it looks
like right there you get a little set of
brushes and a sponge and then you also
get a dual in an eyeliner brush with a
deep brown in black so that's pretty
cool that they included a brown and a
black liner so yeah that is it that is
everything I got from Ulta I really hope
