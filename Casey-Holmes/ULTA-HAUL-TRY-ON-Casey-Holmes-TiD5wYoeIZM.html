a haul slash Tryon I purchased quite a
few makeup products from Ulta and I
figured I would just do like a haul
slash first impression again / try on
haul I guess you could say so
I've tried on some of these things for
you guys and I really hope you enjoy
this kind of style of a haul I did get a
ton of things but I figure this would be
a fun way to kind of showcase everything
so yeah let's get started the first
thing I did not try on for you guys I
have mentioned these before and I never
combine them in Ulta ever it's like once
in a blue moon that I can find them and
I finally got them they're the number
one 26 lashes from I'll or I love these
so much I think there's such gorgeous
lashes and I used to talk about them all
the time but I haven't talked about them
in a while because I just haven't been
able to find them so so happy I got both
of the ones that I saw ok so the next
day I'm really excited about I've never
tried this before but I've heard really
great things about it and it's the Peter
Thomas Roth 24 karat gold mask and it
just says it's an anti-aging treatment
with pure 24 karat gold and it says the
gold helps lift and firm your glow blah
blah blah bright and smooth and
refreshes and yeah I'm just really
intrigued by this product and I haven't
tried it like I said I've heard so many
good things about this but I've just
never tried it so I hope it's good I'm
hoping it's really good I will
definitely let you guys know so this is
a Dolce Dolce and Gabanna Rosa ik solsa
I didn't realize I got the like tiniest
bottle ever but I really like this
perfume it smells so good I'm just oh
I'm in love with it it's the perfect
roast it I tried a different one in my
Sephora haul and I did not like that
floral scent but this one is definitely
right on my alley so this is just gonna
be chilling back there with everyone
else and I did not I didn't realize the
bottom was so small okay and then the
last thing I wasn't able to try on but I
have used this before and I really do
like it I've just I lost it I can't find
it it's do saint-tropez bronzing face
lotion it's non-poor blocking and this
does really give you a nice self tan to
your face if you self stain your body
and you're like I mean you don't
touch your face with just the body
self-tanner I would definitely recommend
a facial once one from saint-tropez is
definitely one of my favorites because
it does not bring me out and it gives a
nice warm glow to your skin like you can
use it two nights in a row I use it
right before I go to bed like after I
cleanse my face and everything my face
is really nice and tan and it stays
pretty tan for a long period of time so
I really like this product I even take
it with me when I'm traveling just so I
can kind of bronze up the skin and make
myself look like I'm glowing and kind of
healthier you know okay the next thing I
got I took it out the packaging because
I did try it on for you guys but is this
Becca under-eye brightening corrector
and it's just this pinky toned corrector
and I really like it I think it
definitely does brighten up the under
eyes I have been using this NYX dark
circle concealer corrector thing which
is more salmony it's basically like the
same ordeal but I do feel like the Beca
one brightens a little bit more this
one's the Becca this one's the next one
the Becca one does brighten a little bit
more but I feel like I like the
consistency of the NYX one better
because it's not as creamy it's a little
bit more dry which for me
like with concealers and stuff when it
comes to pot concealers I need more of
that dry consistency I know most people
are like why would you want a drier
corrector but I just like it because I
feel like everything blends so much
easier it doesn't make me extra oily or
anything like that so I do like this so
far I like how it really brightens up
underneath my eyes but I also like the
next one as well and I kind of like this
next one a little bit better but they
both do a really great job and I'm still
going to try this one out and update you
guys so keep on the lookout for this and
my next hits and misses video and I
would definitely tell you if I kept
using it or not this product I tried in
the video and it is going back I did not
like this at all this is a laura geller
baked radiance cream concealer in light
and I just have one of those it's just
one of those things with these pot
concealers it's so hard for me to find
one that I really love because most of
them are super creamy and with me and my
oily skin and my larger pores it just
doesn't work out like it ends up looking
so bad and that's exactly what happened
with this I even put it down like the
center of my nose and it just looked so
bad it started to break up and I have to
go run some errands today and I was like
I cannot go out looking like
so how to take it off completely I felt
like it looked cakey and I felt like it
sank into my pores as well and this is a
pretty thick concealer it reminds me of
the Anastacio concealers if you've ever
dipped your fingers into that this is
exactly what that feels like and that
the Anasazi ones did not work for me
either and this one just didn't work I
think I'm just gonna quit going for the
pot concealers cuz they just look so bad
on my skin I hate working with them so
that is definitely going back I mean
maybe if you have more dry skin you
might like it
but for me this was definitely a no-go
but the one thing I loved after I fixed
my makeup and put new concealer on Ulta
pressed setting powder and I loved
setting my under eyes at this this is a
course in the shade banana
when I was at Ulta they had a little
tester out and I did my finger into it
and I was like wow this is so smooth and
it is it's a really smooth powder and it
just like melts into the skin it is
amazing and I love it for underneath the
eyes because it brightens but also sets
that area really flawlessly it makes it
look smooth and airbrushed
I feel like this is like a hidden gem in
Ulta I feel like this is even smoother
than the NYX HD finishing powder like
the texture is a lot smoother so I would
definitely try this out if you are
interested I don't know if it's cheaper
than the next one but it's definitely
more affordable than most banana powders
okay the next thing I tried out is from
the brand revolution and I've never seen
this brand before I just randomly saw
when I was in Ulta in the drugstore
section and this is the matte blush and
it's in the shade nude and in the demo
you'll see once I put it on I was like
hell yes this is a much redder color
it's a matte blush it's a very gorgeous
like warm pink neutral I mean it is
stunning it is such a soft blush it
looks beautiful on the skin has a little
hint of mauve in there
this is my kind of blush like this is a
perfect everyday blush for me and this
was only six dollars and this is like a
huge pan a little bit of this blush does
go a really long way and it blends out
so well so I'm gonna have to check out
more of these blushes I don't run
or how many other shades they had but
this is awesome and another thing that I
got from that brand that I'm really
liking is this revolution vivid baked
highlighter this is in the shade golden
lights if you don't like gold
highlighters you are not going to like
this this is definitely more of that
white gold kind of highlighter but I
really like it this is the only one that
they had in stock they had a couple
others that I didn't get to see because
they didn't have them in but I like it
it feels a little dry when you touch it
but it has such amazing color payoff
like look at that highlight it is so
pigmented and it just glows it is
beautiful so I'm really impressed by
this as well again it's from that
revolution brand the only thing I don't
like about packaging like this is the
letters kind of rub off really easily so
that Crimmins
what I do like this so far this brain is
great I need to go pick up the
eyeshadows now because those are awesome
and then the last thing that I got which
is I think is really interesting I don't
know if I'm going to use this as like a
setting powder or a highlighter I don't
quite know yet but when I was playing
with it I really loved the finish of it
and it's this Laura Geller filter finish
setting powder in universal okay it's
really hard to get open oh my goodness
oh okay it just has that mosaic of like
the purples and the Salmons and the
greens and all that but this is I feel
like if you have dry skin and you want
that glow this would be perfect to set
your makeup with for me I'm thinking
more on the highlighter side I'll
probably just use this as a highlighter
because it does give you a really nice
glow and I feel like if you want to set
your face and have that gorgeous glow I
think you'll love this I would even use
it as a blush topper anything like that
I did throw it over my blush today but I
didn't realize that this was going to be
so intense so you can't really tell a
difference with this product but I'm
really excited to keep trying it out and
trying as a highlighter I will keep you
guys updated on how I like it
okay guys so that is it for this ultra
try on haul I hope you guys enjoyed it
if you did like it don't forget to give
it a thumbs up and leave a comment down
below letting me know if you've tried
any of these products and how you liked
them and yeah thank you guys so much for
watching and I will
you all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
