sharing with you this the fall makeup
look it's really simple to get there's
no winged liner there is a line on the
upper lash line but there's no winged
liner anything like that I really love
the way that turned out I think this is
kind of like a classic fall look I'm
just obsessed with it so I'm gonna talk
you guys through this tutorial I hope
you guys enjoy it don't forget to enter
my giveaway if you have no idea what I'm
talking about you should check the
description box below and don't forget
to subscribe so you are notified every
time I upload a video hopefully if
YouTube doesn't mess that up so yeah
anyways if you want to see how I got
this makeup look then let's just go
ahead and get started so we're starting
this video with one eye done this is
what we're gonna get um I figured it
would save some time and honestly I
tried three different looks before I got
to this one and I was like I like this
one the best so I'm gonna share it with
you and I'm gonna talk with you through
this tutorial so today we're taking one
of my favorite to fall palettes I don't
have a discount code for you I'm sorry I
know a lot of people do on YouTube so
you can probably just google it this is
a morphe 35o palette pretty sure they
still sell it if not you can always find
colors like this pretty much anybody has
it I mean there's so many eyeshadow
palettes out nowadays you're bound to
find one first I'm taking the vanilla
shade I'm just going to set my lid where
I just put that primer so everything
else just glides on perfect and even so
now I'm going to take that shade right
there and we're going to blend this into
the crease and kind of just all over the
lid you really want to blend this out
nicely this is our transition shade so
you could take it up towards the brow
more I'm going to take the Mac to 1/7
and we're going to mix these two shades
together right here these are like some
my favorite shades and we're going to
put these in the crease and we're not
going above that transition shade so I'm
just going to take that brush we're just
going to blend it in there this is great
because these colors are really nice
they're a little bit deeper but they're
not too deep you know what I'm saying
like you could still work with it I'm
going to get in the inner corner drag it
into the crease in the outer corner I'm
just doing small circular motions to
make sure
blend everything out nests today okay
I'm going to take a shorter brush this
is the Mac 239 I like this one for so
many different reasons going to dip it
into this color right here and I'm
focusing this on that outer part then
I'm going to take the tip of the brush
and drag it in the crease just so we
don't get too high with that dark
product and then I'm also going to put
it in the inner corner you can kind of
get it on the center of the lid but try
to leave a little bit of skin there just
for the center color we put on I like to
use this color because I can build it up
it's not like I've really intense black
so it's a little bit easier to work with
going back in with my last Mac brush I'm
going to use just this shade right here
I'm going to blend that out so again
just kind of like small circular motions
I would even use it like this honestly
like I believe that I look like this put
a little bit of color here just I love
the way this looks okay and now we're
going to take a flat brush this is the
Mac 242 so I'm going to take a glitter
adhesive and I'm going to put it right
where there's that little bit of skin
showing take it up to the crease as well
this is just a help that glitter stick
on the lid and not fall out absolutely
everywhere then I'm going to take this
shade right here and you kind of want to
work quickly while doing this so that
the glitter glue doesn't like just dry
on you it's really pretty you see it's
absolutely stunning I'm just going to
press this the center of the lid
you can see this in our corner got a
little bit of shimmer in there but I'm
going to try to keep it mainly in the
ball of the eye then I'm going to take
this little Mac brush against it is more
precise and the brush and the bristles
aren't just like every we're going to
blend the edges so now it's a little bit
difficult to blend it just because that
glitter glue is there and it kind of
tugs up the eye and it really locks that
glitter in so just take your time so at
this point I'll just kind of go in with
whatever I'll add a little bit of
glitter
I won't it just kind of depends on how
I'm feeling and this OP is totally up to
you what you want to do with the look
and how intense you want the glitter to
be okay and then your eye shadow is done
in that crazy it's so simple for liner
we're just going to take a matte black
eye liner and we're just gonna do one
line on our upper lash line so I'm going
to take the Luxy lash in West Side very
very pretty fluffy lashes you can use
this with a lot of different looks and
I'm just going to apply this and I'll be
back to finish up my face with you guys
so the first thing I'm going to do for
my face is I'm going to take these
Smashbox primer water look at this you
guys I love this stuff I love it so I'm
just going to spray all over my face the
mist on this is literally so good does
that mean apply my pore minimizing
primer and this is great for my t-zone
have large pores and right now I have
some texture right here cuz of this
breakout I'm gonna take this and I'm
going to put this in my t-zone so right
where I get oily and have the largest
pores you can see right there it just
kind of magnifies your skin I really
like it this is like a Holy Grail
product for me I've always always always
have it and then if you have more dry
skin or you just don't really have large
pores then I would go with this Smashbox
photo finish foundation primer this is
like an award-winning primer people love
it it is oil free and like I said if you
don't have like any problems with your
skin I would use this if you just want
your foundation to go on really nice and
smooth
and just stay all day long but since I
do have like problematic skin I stick
with the pore minimizer because it
really helps my pores like not look so
big so now I'm going to use my studio
skin Smashbox 15-hour we're hydrating
foundation and this is a shade
two-point-four this why I've been
wearing recently I think I need a little
bit of a lighter shade to mix it with
this just a tiny bit okay I'm going to
mix 2.25 and 2.4 if you don't follow me
on snapchat I was talking to you guys
about this foundation and this is a
foundation that I wore in New York and I
wore it Saturday because that's the only
day I wore makeup and I put this
foundation on at what was it at 12:30
p.m. and then literally you guys because
the reason why I did that is I was like
I'm gonna go ahead and do a full face
makeup because I know I won't want to do
it later so I went ahead and put it on
and I use my concealer and everything
like that the studio skin one and you
guys I did not touch up my face I went
to like a benefit party me and Davis
went to the club of stairs after the
benefit party we were dancing sweating
this foundation lasted till 3:30 a.m. I
know you probably don't believe me but I
swear to you Foundation is definitely
more than 15 hour where I mean at least
for me because that whole day it was hot
I was sweating I was shopping and I did
not touch up my makeup I mean it's
amazing my figure I want to tell you
guys about that because I think it's
really important I like I'm really
important once I had that experience I
was like I have to include this in a
video and tell my story because it's
freaking awesome and they formulated
this foundation to work in any form of
light so the way that it looks in this
light is the same as it's going to look
outside it doesn't oxidize or anything
like that now I'm going to take the
studio skin concealer this is light
neutral I really like it this is a great
like every day or going out concealer
just is so lightweight on the skin and
this also has great coverage as well the
foundation has medium to full coverage
like the first time you apply it is
going to be more medium but you can
build it up to full and it's not going
to look
on your skin just gonna take my I feel
like this is like the body Beautyblender
like I don't know this seems a lot more
ginormous to me that it's probably just
me being crazy and they say this
concealers our 24-hour wear and since I
wore it for that whole freaking day I
agree with that claim I mean it wasn't
24 hours but the damn lungta to set my
concealer you guys already know if you
can watch me in my last few videos I'm
going to use this flower beauty loose
powder it's in number lo1 and while
traveling the sister ended up working
and now it's everywhere I was taking the
sifter out to get to the product but I
guess traveling and Delta throwing my
 around got it through the sifter I
absolutely love this powder you guys if
you have not tried it out what are you
doing it's really really good
I have not used like my Laura Mercier
translucent powder any high-end powder
since I found this I like it better than
a la Prairie powder you guys know that I
tried that out for when my videos this
is just as good if not better than that
powder and it's not a hundred dollars
which is great but the powder foundation
from la Prairie
that's my jam okay so now that we have
our brows on I'm going to dust away my
baking and I'm also going to kind of
drag a little bit of it on the outer
parts of my face just to make sure we
set everything so now it's time for
bronzer my knees my favorite bronzer at
the moment which is the Neutrogena
Healthy Skin in number 30 some kiss this
is a great bronzer it's like the most
natural bronze look ever it's just so
pretty
I cannot get enough of it and I'm going
to put this all over my face I mean look
at that
gosh I need to start self-tanning soon
because we're going into the warmer or
not the warmer months I wish you were
we're going into the cooler months I
really need to self tan if you guys
don't know I love the loving tan
self-tanner I like to use the ultra dark
one it's just so good
for forever and it is so dark like
whenever I put that self tear on I
better have a dark foundation that's
like five times darker than my skin
because it is dark but that's why I love
it you know like if I'm in a self-tan I
don't want to be like I don't want to
have a glow I want to be tan and that
does that to me so that's one of my
favorites I always have it linked down
below and I have like a code for a free
glove or something so if you're
interested you could check that out but
I'm have to do that real soon okay and
then to contour I'm actually going to
take this elf fiji matte duo and it has
like a little contour and a blush so I'm
going to use this little elf this little
Real Techniques brush and contour it
with it it's not too intense but that's
what I like about it you just get that
nice shadow okay and now I'm just going
to take my stippling brush by the way
this is from anyway so drugstore makeup
brand that you can find in CVS that's
what I like to use and then I'm also
gonna take that same blush in this
palette I'm just going to go ahead and
use it and we're just apply it to the
cheeks it's a really pretty color as
like a little nice swash rosiness so
pretty now we're gonna take the makeup
geek Kathleen lights palette this is her
highlighter palette and I'm going to
take this gold trader here and apply to
the tops of my cheekbones how pretty
that is
I love the formula of this - it's like
super smooth okay now we're going to
finish off the eyes so I'm going back
into the morphe 35o palette and I'm
going to take a flat shader brush if you
can't pick things up off the ground with
your toes you're doing life wrong so I'm
going to go in with this shade right
here I'm going to highlight underneath
my brow
you
we're going to line the waterline with
an eyeliner then I'm going to take this
shade right here that we use on the
really inner corner and outer corner I'm
going to take that color and I'm going
to smudge this up against that lower
lash line
then I'm going to take a pencil brush
and this shade right here and I'm just
going to blend out the edges of that
okay and then on to the fun part which
is the dark ellipse I'm going to take
this essence lipliner in a soft berry or
maybe not I'm going to take this Pilate
Oh a lip liner in Cabernet and then for
the lipstick I'm going to use these
smashbox always on the go lipstick in
misconduct
this color is fall fall fall fall so you
can leave a like this but i actually
want to go a little bit more in tips so
i'm going to use the True Grit liquid
lipstick from Smashbox which is a really
dark brown
okay so that is it for this video thank
you guys so much for watching I hope you
enjoyed this makeup look and I will see
you all in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
