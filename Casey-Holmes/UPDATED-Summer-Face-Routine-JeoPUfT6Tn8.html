a new face routine i will be using the
laura geller balance in brighton
foundation ship i purchased it a couple
weeks ago and a lot of you have been
requesting for me to do a new face
routine on it or a review let me just
say I absolutely love this stuff I'm not
going to tell you it keeps you mad um it
kind of does for like a couple hours it
keeps me Matt but I have to go in with
another powder and kind of like blunt my
face which is normal because i have
really oily skin so it's hard to find
something where I don't have to
completely touch up my face so yeah I've
been absolutely loving this so I
definitely think it's worth the money I
like to use more powders instead of
foundations anyways and if I do use
foundation I live my NARS one which
doesn't match me because I quit tanning
so I'm more pale I've been loving this
um also recently know that I did apply
this cetaphil oil moisturizer actually
apply this before I blow dry my hair so
it has time to kind of sink or seep into
my skin so I did put this on and they
also use this hydroxatone instead of
fact signing second wrinkle reducer they
sell this brand at Ulta and I got this
in my little order that I placed with
them as it for a sample it's like one of
the sample choices I love it i'm
purchasing the full size and it's sixty
dollars just crazy but it's seriously
like I like diminishes the fine lines I
have so yeah if you're interested in
seeing my face retain just keep watching
okay so the first thing I'm going to do
is take the Revlon age-defying concealer
in medium you guys know I love this
stuff and I'm just going to apply this
underneath my eyes I don't do as much as
I did or I did in my last face routine I
just kind of lightened it up a little
bit or not lined it up but I just don't
do it as much like all the way in that
triangle I just kind of do it under my
eyes now she's focusing on those dark
circles and I feel like patting it in
with your finger it's such a great way
to apply concealer underneath your eyes
because it really melts that product
into your skin and it blends it so well
and you know it's better to Pat into rub
I'm going to conceal anything on my face
so I'm going to take the time bomb from
the balm this is the concealer and I
actually really love this stuff it
covers so well and it's just like the
perfect color so I just put this on any
kind of redness blushes anything like
that but just want to even out like up
here I kind of have like acne scars and
stuff on my upper lip so I like to just
conceal those and I have redness around
my nose a little bit on my nose so I
just kind of conceal right there
so now that we've concealed and we have
everything we won't cover it up I'm
going to take the elf high-definition
powder which I absolutely am in love
with I love this since I've gotten it
it's just the best under eye concealer
like powder it's like the best
transparent powder to set my concealer
with so I do like that that also helps
them messing this too because it doesn't
really get messy like that then I'm just
going to set all my concealer anywhere I
put it I'm just going to set it I'm
using an elf blush brush by the way ok
so now at least our concealer I'm going
to put this laura geller balance and
Brighton foundation on it's just a
powder foundation I'm a media and I like
to use a powder brush personally because
I don't want to do too much coverage i
just want to do like a light dusting of
it just to kind of even everything out
so i'm using my stolen lace powder brush
this is the 376 and I'm just dusting
this all over my face I love this stuff
and if you want more coverage you can
totally use a more dense brush
and usually the mornings I do is super
quickly but I'm talking to you guys
through talking to be very quick okay
next I'm going to just kind of warm up
my face and I'm taking this matte
bronzer in soft sand I love this just to
warm up my skin tone when I think it's
great and I'm taking this brush from
crown brush I don't know what it's
called I'm just gonna dust this over the
areas that need to be kind of warmed up
it's like where the Sun would kind of
hit and everything oh it really good tan
I just want to avoid the eye area
because I want to keep that nice and
bright and light okay next we're doing
blush and bronzer so I like to combine
like ever since I found this Park Avenue
princess stuff it has been like a
godsend I absolutely love this stuff and
I like to put this underneath my blushes
and it just adds an extra to your skin I
just thought it was so pretty it kind of
gives you the bronze look and then you
can add color like from the blush on top
so I'm just going to take Park Avenue
princess with a sitter lace a few three
and i'm going to apply this on my cheeks
and up to my temples so kind of where
you would normally place like bronzer
and it's just like the shimmers and
stuff in it really like just complements
any skin tone alright so next I'm going
to take this mac blush and fleet fast I
kind of alternate between this one like
at the moment with this one and doll
face from Tarte because I really love
these blushes I did recently purchase
them not too long ago and it's just been
loving them and I'm going to take the
same brush and I'm going to take fleet
fast and I'm just going to place that on
my cheese a little bit to my temple
I'm not a pretty much it for my face
routine it's very simple really easy i
also want to throw it at the end a
couple powers i use throughout the day
to kind of you know mattify my face
again first i do use these nyx matte
blotting papers these are really great
if you have super release again it just
really gets the oil up and it works so
so well I really recommend these and
then there's two powders i use ones more
high end and one is drugstore the high
end one is also by laura geller this is
the mapmaker the white looks super
intimidating but I promise you it does
not leave a white cast on your face it
does keep you Matt I really really like
this stuff this is what I keep in my
purse most of the time but for drug
store I am like in love with this is my
all-time favorite drugstore powder
definitely it's the Physicians Formula
cover talks 10 powder I have mentioned
this a few times in my videos this is in
transparent medium and I absolutely love
it this is the best one I find because
like it doesn't get cakey or anything
like that and it actually leaves like an
airbrushed look to your skin it's I just
love it it's my favorite drugstore
powder totally worth the money you guys
know me and physicians formula are kind
of like or off and on but this is an
amazing product from them I absolutely
recommend it so yeah oh by the way and
the brush I use I take this with me
everywhere it's the elf kabuki brush
just to kind of apply either powder to
my face to mattify my skin so I hope you
guys enjoyed this little video like it
if you did I would love your support and
I will see you all in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
