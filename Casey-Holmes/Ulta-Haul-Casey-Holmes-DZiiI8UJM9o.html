ahah I know I feel like I'm doing so
many Ulta hauls lately I'm not even
really doing Sephora hauls because I'm
getting more stuff from Ulta than I am
Sephora not sure is my mic on yes not
sure what's going on with that but I
just keep buying stuff the main reason
why I even want to go into Ulta was to
get makeup for a drugstore book and then
I just kept finding things so I figured
I would just show you guys in a haul I
showed you I had went on snapchat and I
went to Target and you know those two
are just terrible for your wallet
hopefully this bag doesn t on your
nerves because it gets on mine so I
totally get it
let's see first thing I got was some
Neutrogena makeup removing cleansing
towelettes these are fragrance free to
have the ultra soft cloth I use these
for videos and you know getting a little
bit of makeup underneath my lower lash
line I don't take off my makeup with it
completely unless I'm like exhausted
what else take it okay so I got this YSL
black opium little travel-size I got a
new purse and I realized I have my Chloe
in there which is this little bottle
over here this is one of my favorite
perfumes definitely check it out I think
it's like Chloe de Rosa or something it
smells so good but it smells like it's
leaking like I don't know what it is so
I wanted to get something like this
figured I would use black opium I have
Tom Ford on right now but hostile so
good I always go for the ones that have
sprays because the roller balls don't
really do anything to me I love to spray
it on my body and everything so I wanted
to get this for my purse because I don't
feel like effing up my purse you feels
okay so I got quite a few things from
the brand revolution because I've tried
their blush and a highlighter and I
really liked it I want to try new
products so this is the ultra contour
ultra professional contour palette
where's my squeezers Up Guys no I can't
I can't break a nail right now just
gonna be done Oh
sleek so it's like a nice shiny package
ooh
these marble colors look like something
extra that's way too light for me boo
that banana shade feels amazing so now I
should show you guys that this is
what the inside of the palette looks
like it has a huge mirror and then some
highlighters another highlighter over
here banana powder some contour shades I
really like this oh I cannot wait to put
that on my face I'm really excited and
then I also got this blush palette this
is in the shade hot spice they look
really pretty again what's kind of like
the marble look right here I'll put in a
close-up of these and then I get another
one this is the last one and this is the
ultra professional bronze palette I just
want to try all this stuff out for you
guys and see how well it worked so again
these are a little bit lighter I don't
know what do we really use these for I
will let you guys know how I feel about
these so there are those colors that's
pretty true to color right there and
again it has this to tell you when it's
where it's matte and shimmer and this
huge - mirrors in the comment section
handy then I got an eye shadow palette
from them which is the flawless matte
ultra eye shadows because I love Matt
and I got another palette in here from a
different brand I decided to go with the
all matte palette because I had already
picked up a different palette from the
drugstore in here that had some showers
in it like I use matte all the time
anyways so I figured I would just give
this one a go they all have like the
same packaging and this one's in
flawless matte like I said oh they're
tiny they're little babies looks like
pretty decent permutation everything is
pretty light as you can see that's
pretty true to color I mean there's not
a ton of dark shades like really dark
shades but they are really pretty I'll
have to update you guys let you know
maybe this would be a good like
transition shade or blending palette
this does have all of the names of the
shadows on them which you know I like
that they did that but then again I kind
of like I lose these things all the time
okay this is the other palette that I
got from the drugstore that I really was
excited about this is a NYX ultimate
shadow palette and that's had gorgeous
colors in it and it says smokey and
highlight oh hello and that's what that
one looks like
isn't that gorgeous that is like true
color right there they are so beautiful
when I touch them they were just so
pigmented you can see right there also
got this Rimmel highlight contour and
blush kit I got the one in golden bronze
number three and I just haven't tried
this out and I wanted to oh wow it
wasn't sealed at all but this is what
the packaging looks like right here and
that's the inside the bronzer is super
dark
I'm hoping it's like not just pigmented
yeah it's not bad
there's the bronzer right there it's not
too pigmented the highlight is in not
that great and then let's see the blush
the blush is like a NARS orgasm kind of
thing but it's really really chalky so
I'll have to play with it and let you
guys know what I think but I love how
compact this is and I just love the way
that it looks so again this one is from
Rimmel okay next up just a few more
things from the makeup revolution brand
so I have three more things from the
makeup revolution brand as somebody I
saw when I was talking about this brand
and one of my videos they told me to try
out this highlighter which is in radiant
lights and the other one was so pretty
it's a very gold highlighter if you
don't like gold you will not like that
highlighter so I figured I would try
this one out because I figured maybe
more people would like this one and
that's what it looks like right there it
does have a pink tint to it which I'm
not a huge fan of but that looks really
beautiful so I can't wait to use this on
my face and then I also did pick up this
makeup revolution lip lacquer and
nothing like anything I guess this is
the name of it it says intense color
high shine long-lasting gloss oh I
thought it was like a liquid lipstick I
probably should have read the packaging
better but I thought this was a super
pretty color so that's what it looks
like right there wow look at that
that is intense so hey that's pretty
this is kind of like a darker coral I
did not expect that kind of color payoff
so that's awesome and it doesn't smell
like it has
to it okay a hint of a smell but it's
not bad it doesn't smell bad nice last
thing I got from them was this ultra
all-day Prime and anti-shine bomb it's
weightless invisible coverage for a
flawless face the fuses imperfections
and the appearance of fine lines and
fine lines and wrinkles they say it can
be used under makeup as a primer you
could set makeup and extend the wear or
in place of a traditional pressed powder
to absorb oil and eliminate shine out
leaving a powdery trace the silky
translucent crystal finish catches light
diffusing skin imperfections and reduces
the appearance of fine lines and
wrinkles I don't know this just sounded
interesting to me it kinda reminds me of
that Malley bomb you guys haven't I'm
talking about it's just you're not going
to be able to see it but it is a clear
kind of waxy feel product oh definitely
keep you guys updated sometimes the
products like this it just makes me look
even more oily because it's just a hot
mess but I will keep you updated and let
you know what I think because I'll just
let you test see I'm a powder girl I
love powders so I get two of the new
Laura highlighters I got the color
daylight and star light these two were
just oh so beautiful I went in there
thinking I was just gonna get star light
but then I felt daylight and lights
watched it and it just looks so
beautiful so I had to get both so this
one's in the shade daylight this is more
of like a gold champagne color oh my god
I love this one so happy I decided to
just play with it
Oh stunning they're super smooth they
have the same packaging as the blushes
which again I love I love I love I love
this packaging they did such a great job
with putting like the color on the back
and the clear front to it I just they
did so good I can't say enough good
things about lorac right now I think
their products are killing it so this
one is in the shade starlight just kind
of like daylight but a little bit more
white so you can see right there I mean
you're probably like I don't see a
difference but this one's definitely a
little bit lighter and a little bit more
white and this one just has like a
little bit more gold in it so I love
both of them though I think they are
both stunning daylight might be like my
ultimate fave but they are gorgeous so
since I love my other blushes that I got
from them so
I decided to purchase this one this is
in Technicolor and this just looks like
a great everyday blush for me because I
love these kinds of colors so this is
just like a great everyday coral kind of
blush I just think it's beautiful and it
blends out so well this is a matte color
and it could go with so many different
looks I love these kinds of shades I
think it's just so beautiful oh and that
is a heavy swatch so it looks really
intense but you could use a light hand
with it and it will just look like a
nice flush to your cheeks last but not
least I have tried this product before
and I really like it this is the TARDIS
tortoise glossy lip paint this is in the
shade double tap these have a great
formula and I don't have this color you
can kind of see these are my own colors
so this is what looks like it's just
such a pretty gloss so intense and
pigmented doesn't have a smell and I
love the applicator of them as well
I love these longer kind of doffo
applicators everybody has actually I
don't need to put down the lips because
I'm testing this out for you guys and
this is just a color that I knew I would
use all the time so I had to pick it up
okay guys so that is it for this Ulta
haul I really hope you enjoyed it keep

first impressions thank you so much for
