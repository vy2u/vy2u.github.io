you first walk in I'll just go ahead and
give you a little tour really quick so
that's what it looks like let me build a
hive a sees you as you wait baby
okay behind the door I do have like some
Victoria's Secret bags that I got with
you know the free gift with purchase
kind of things have my camera bag on my
course dust bag a makeup bag and just
different things like that and I got the
little hook from TJ Maxx I believe here
in the center I have my nail polishes I
got these two nail polish tracks on
Amazon if you just go on Amazon and look
up nail polish racks they will pull out
there's like so many on there so that's
just where I got mine from and I did get
this sign from TJ Maxx I believe a while
back and then this desk right here
almost everything in this room furniture
wise actually I think everything is from
Ikea so this is the mound drawer I used
to use this for my makeup back in the
day and yeah I just didn't like it the
drawer ended up falling out over here I
got my garment rack from Amazon as well
again you can just look it up and there
will be so many that pull up and I
recently got the velvet hangers for this
and I'm so in love with it
I will never go back to plastic hangers
like I want to completely redo my closet
now also have like some jeans on there
and then I have this mirror and this is
just chilling here I just don't really
feel like throwing it away
think I got that from Walmart okay now I
get a ton of questions on these shelving
units these two are these same units
that one is just smaller so I love these
again from Ikea I can't exactly remember
the name but that's where I gotten from
I'll leave a link down below for you
guys so this is just where I store all
my shoes like most of my booties and
then up top I got the little boxes here
from TJ Maxx a while back and then the
Paris picture I think was like from
Walmart forever ago I've had that for so
long so I just decided to hang it up
there moving on to this little guy so I
have some like lotions for a Victoria's
Secret that I got from the semi-annual
sale and something from
and glory I have my wild fox sunglasses
and then I have like my jewelry in the
back and I just have my - Princess Pea
jewelry boxes okay in the first cubby I
just have my perfumes and then over here
I have some more palettes I also have
this Sigma brush case and some extra
Sigma brushes I have many of my current
Michael Kors bag Michael Kors large /g
Hamilton I believe so it's called and
then I have that Michael Kors bag and I
got that purse from my sister for
Christmas I love it it's from Jessica
Simpson and then in this last cubby I
just have a bunch of hair stuff mainly
dry shampoo but anything that has to do
with styling your hair is in here it's
so many questions on where I get this
mirror and it is also from Ikea can't
remember the name again but I will and
get down below and then this sign up top
is from Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond I got it a
long time ago and I just thought was
super cute she's putting on lipstick so
now this is my favorite part of the room
obviously it is my makeup collection and
storage don't freak out all this is not
my makeup collection I just have these
drawers over here for my makeup and then
this is for office supplies stuff and
then down here is like hair stuff and
things like that
again all the furniture is from Ikea the
mirror is from vanity girl Hollywood and
yeah oh my lights I also got from BH
photo and video I believe I love these
lights these are all I use for my videos
and they're really nice LED lights so
yeah let's just go ahead and get started
with D makeup collection so - all these
drawers I just have these are all my lip
liners and lip glosses i do recycle' my
Bath and Body Works candles so I find
different uses for them and I really
like that they're all in here because I
can see them and use different ones and
then I also have this one full of
samples like foundation samples primer
samples mascaras just any kind of sample
guys that are kind of like deluxe sized
they'll go in here I also have extra
brushes and don't use on the regular and
then behind these I have my palettes if
you see this Mac shadow is busted so I'm
just trying to
there but I have some pallets over here
they're just hanging out back here these
are actually kind of like my most used
pallets and then over there I have a
Sigma brush kit and then I also have
alcohol spray makeup and my Mac brush
cleanser in that one okay so in this
first short I just have my lashes this
one's kind of crazy because I just used
these today I absolutely love these
lashes but I just have different ones in
here I need to kind of restock all my
lashes just because I've been using
these gypsy ones a lot these are
probably one of my favorite pairs of
lashes but I just keep my Glasgow in
here little tweezer guys and scissors
and the second drawer I have some little
eyeshadow palettes and also single
eyeshadows the reason why I like these
drawers so much is because they do go
out a lot further than the Alex 9 drawer
where the Alex 9 drawer is definitely
about half the size of this so you're
kind of just stacking things on top of
each other and you don't get to
necessarily see all of the items that
you have so I love this because I can
open this drawer look at what I have and
just try different things
now this Shore is kind of different I
don't really know what I want to put in
here this little container I actually
got these little net things from
Walgreens and like the office selection
so it has like my eyeshadow primer in it
my eyebrow items another primer in here
and has tweezers this just always gets
pulled out so I have this hanging out in
here and then I also have my eyeliners
and mascaras in this drawer only have
three mascaras I did go through all this
stuff and got rid of a bunch of
different things so right now I'm just
going off with three mascaras I did a
first impression on this one which if
you haven't seen it I'll link it down
below and then I love this mascara from
covergirl and my favorite two mascara
ever which is the white belt baby doll I
have more brow parts over here I have
like this Sigma brow powder and a Milani
little kit aqua seal I have some balm
stains I have some gel liners some
maybelline color whispers extra lip
glosses sharpeners and then in this sky
I have random stuff this short in the
next two drawers are probably my
favorite because I love face products so
in here I just have
all of my foundations these are all up
to date as well I love a bunch of
different foundations I love trying new
ones then I have some makeup sprays this
one's the b6 or my decay the BIC fix
plus from Mac and the cap on D lock and
load
I'm not really a huge fan of makeup
setting spray to be quite honest with
you I do regret buying most of these but
um you know I have them a finding them
this is my concealer little drawer I
just have like my Mac prepping primes I
have a covergirl trublend stick just
different concealers in there in this
one I have my beauty creams my favorite
one is definitely this one by Garnier I
have this Revlon Photoready skin lights
illuminator and then I have this
Maybelline fit me foundation which is
pretty dark and I use that for when I
want to do a cream contour and then over
here I just have primers and backups of
things and like some drugstore primers
just hang out in here okay so this short
I have powders just have different
powders ranging from drugstore like
Nick's and wet and wild to NARS map Dior
just different kinds of powders I love
loose powders I love pressed powders I
just I love trying different ones and I
do have this benefit one I am trying it
out so just stay tuned for that and
everything over here that is in its
packaging is going to be first
impressions so you're kind of getting a
sneak peek of what I'm gonna have for
our first impressions really soon this
drawer I have my bronzers blushes and
highlighters
over here I have palettes I have my NARS
day Mari palette I also have this Tarte
blush palette that was out for the
holidays I have my first Mac blush
palette in here and then this is
actually a blush palette that is empty I
plan on defining some of these Mac
blushes and putting them in here as long
as they don't have like cool packaging
or whatnot this is my bronzers and yeah
I just again ranging from high-end to
drugstore
I love bronzers and trying out different
ones so I just keep them all in here I
have my blushes over here some from
Sigma some from the balm BH Cosmetics
the new Maybelline ones Smashbox these
are all my matte blushes and then I have
some more drugstore ones over here
and then my heart ones who have like my
high layers right in here as well just
kind of hanging out and then the rest of
this is kind of boring this is actually
the last drawer with some stuff in it I
have extra brushes in here I have this
little case that goes all my Sigma
brushes I have some back to mak items
and then this holds business cards and
like little little bitty samples so if
you ever give me a business card I do
keep it I always just throw them in
there so that is it for these drawers
these drawers are also two separate
units you have one two three four five
six it's a six straw stack them on top
of each other just to have more room and
if I needed more storage I have it right
underneath it for my makeup so I love
these I love how big they are and again
I love that I can lay out all of my
makeup over here I do have my lipsticks
I got these little lipstick organizers
from Amazon as well just have all my Mac
ones drugstore and my eye brushes here
in face brushes I know they all need to
be washed everything needs to be washed
over here but these are all of the items
that I use on a daily basis so I make
sure I keep them right here ready to go
and again I did recycle the bath bed
bath what does it call Bath and Body
Works candle over here I have a
heat-protective if I don't have it like
writing for my face I will forget to use
it I have this Rimmel stay matte
foundation that I want to try this is a
different color so I'm going to see if
that will maybe match me I have my Mac
Pro Longwear concealer I have these here
because as you can see I'm running low
on these so if I store them like this I
won't get the product that I want and
this is actually something that I got
from my Sigma meetup it's so cute it's
just a mirror and says Sigma its
Blondie's so cute and I don't want to
mess it out so I keep it right here so I
can look at it because I absolutely love
it that was so cute over here we have my
big mirror I have a deodorant as a hand
sanitizer in foundations I want to
return and then back behind my mirror I
do have my whitening lightening doll
small kit and it brushes that need to be
washed now these little drawers right
here are basically like the Alex 9
drawer
they're just of course these smaller
ones to fit underneath this table I
wanted something like this for my
products just because I didn't really
have any room for them and I liked that
they're right here right next to me so
first drawer oh sorry easy
hi blue B first drawer I have like make
up whites just to clean off my hands and
things like that I have two in here
because I was using them to take off my
makeup but I no longer use them anymore
I have some bun makers teasing combs
things like that I have cotton raw
cotton rods and up
I have cotton swabs over here combs
little things like that and I just have
all this in the store it's kind of messy
but has everything I need next short is
my bonnet for God at products this is
where I put my body forgot items so I
know what I have and when I need to use
and I'll just open this drawer and go to
it first
and then I also have oh hi I have more
stuff back here
oh that's must have been for my last
spot I forgot it
oopsies totally forgot about them but um
I do have a brush cleaner down here and
yeah just keep my body fries up in here
I got a key here blue B I sorry face and
here I just have my extensions nothing
too crazy going on I have quite a few
extensions I actually just put mine in
so they're kind of messy in here now but
usually I have them laid out really
nicely and then I have my Sigma drying
shape that I love for when I wash my
brushes and then back there's just like
miscellaneous things
so in this drawer I have my most used
things I have curling on straightener
little things like this I have my little
clinical wand from nume actually broke
my nume megastar so I'm having to use
old straighteners it's driving me
absolutely insane and then in here I
just have more curling irons just
hanging out in here you can see there's
there's just a bunch of them so they all
hang out in here then this drawer was
where I kept all my makeup it is a
little dirty I'm sorry but this is where
I keep off the supplies now and things
like that than I need so that's pretty
much it for my makeup collection I hope
