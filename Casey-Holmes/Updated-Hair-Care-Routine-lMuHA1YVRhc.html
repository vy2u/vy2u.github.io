quick updated haircare routine I know I
just went a few years ago but as you can
see in that video I wasn't very excited
about the products that I had and I told
you that I was gonna go buy new products
and I did and I'm super in love with the
products that I got and I'm gonna try to
do it quickly because the Sun is going
down you can see the shadow like right
there
so yeah and I did spray my bangs back so
hopefully I will not touch them a lot
because it's really annoying to other
people so I did hair spray um I might
still do that because if I feel it
coming forward I'll just kind of put my
finger back there but I'm trying so I
said in one of my videos I changed my
hair a lot and it's usually just the
thing that I do and it's just what I've
always done so I'm sorry if it's
annoying to you but I don't even know
I'm doing it half the time so and my
voice I'm still sick so just excuse my
hot mess okay so we're gonna go ahead
get into it since the sun's going down
and we're going to talk about stuff I
use in the shower
my two favorite shampoo and conditioners
that I've been using as the red kunal
soft I really do love this line I find
that they're so great and they really do
make your hair super soft I'm more in
love with the shampoo that I'm in the
then than I am with a conditioner
because the shampoo um catch my breath
like this sickness I cannot catch my
breath but this does not leave your hair
Lea like feeling brittle and like dry
and nasty you know how some shampoos do
this one does not do that it is very
great at leaving your hair super soft
and I don't feel like I have to go and
apply a conditioner right after because
it feels so dry and nasty so I love this
shampoo conditioners really good as well
definitely recommend it and then another
shampoo that I use is this shimmer like
shampoo and it's for the blonde silver
hair I love this stuff it makes your
hair super blonde and just like really
really pretty so I love it and I use it
a lot more than you're supposed to but
it doesn't affect my color because some
people say I'll turn you gray or silver
am I not doing that so I use this a lot
probably at least for three
four times a week so you know whatever
um the next thing but if you do see
color-changing with your hair if you
keep doing that like every day you might
want to stop that's just uh kind of yeah
thing so when I get out of the shower of
course like I told you guys I want you
to comb my hair and then I sprayed this
cheek hair to miss which I am in love
with I spray it all over my roots and I
rub it in and I section my hair off and
spray my roots basically where all the
blonde is on the top of my head that's
where all of this goes and it is so
amazing I'm in love with it everybody
with chi products she was kind of
wishy-washy either you like them or you
don't
and personally I love the Chi product so
I love this stuff this stuff has been
amazing and it's a leave-in
strengthening treatment treatment and
it's paraben free and I'm just in love
with it and it's 12 fluid ounces and I
think I paid like $15 for something like
that it's not really a bad deal at all
the next one is one of my favorites and
it's the Sebastian postin number nine
and I put this in also before I blow dry
my hair and I'm just gonna show you the
kind of consistency it is okay well
you're not really gonna see now but I'm
it's like this orange color and it's
kind of a thicker kind of I don't know
kind of a thicker because it oh man I
put all my towels up but um it's really
really great leaves your hair so super
super soft and it's just an amazing
amazing product I really truly love it
um it kind of like men's all your split
ends and it just makes it look really
nice let me read the bottle teeth real
quick because I agree with everything on
the bottle and a nature each bottle and
you guys know I love it so it's a
specialized the ultimate versatile
styling cream with nine botanical
extracts it helps restore lost moisture
and rejuvenates the healthy look of your
hair perfect for styling your hair and
multiple looks with flexible hold
totally agree looks amazing your hair
like it just I don't know like when I
straighten my hair I'm just like oh my
god it's so soft it just glides through
the strainer and it's just amazing so I
recommend this stuff it is pricey it's
like twenty dollars but seriously I'm
swearing by all these products I'm
showing you now
like these have made my blonde hair so
much healthier and Lord strapped me a
lot and in which she will not I swear by
this stuff and if you go by it I promise
you will love them if you have like dry
damaged hair you know like unbleached
hair cuz all of the hair or all the hair
I'll have a blonde on my head is I don't
do that ok I know a lot of you to ask me
if I do my own hair heck to the no all
the ground is real all the blonde is
fake so and it is bleach so right yeah
the next thing I'm going to show you is
this cheering garden this the last thing
I love this stuff it's actually amazing
some people say it makes their hair feel
like straw I felt like the got to be one
made my hair feel like straw but this
one makes it so soft and it's super
dependable I can definitely rely on this
if I'm using a lot of heat on my hair
that day if I'm gonna do a hair tutorial
like I will be done soon I definitely
rely on this stuff to keep my hair
protected and it does and it keeps it so
soft and I'm just in love so yeah those
are the products I've been using on the
hair of course I'll list them down below
I got all of them other than this one
ICDs and this one I got at Sally's
Beauty Supply it retails for 829 but I
had a five dollar off coupon so I got
for like 3 or 4 bucks but I have paid
full retail for this before and it's 8
fluid ounces um and don't be afraid if
you've never used a purple shampoo this
is a purple shampoo so just looks it's
basically the color of the bottle
alright so don't be freaked down when
you're in the shower and you're like oh
my god it's purple no it's supposed to
be purple s-sir
but yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
updated hair care video I really want to
get up for y'all because I am so in love
with these products and I'm pretty proud
of myself too cuz I have not touched my
