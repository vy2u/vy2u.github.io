gonna be doing a Valentine's Day and
makeup look I don't really know exactly
what I'm doing but I have a few
different things here we can play with
like this Victoria Beckham eye foil that
was with Estee Lauder these new little
what are these called eyes shadow trios
from Smashbox a glitter and then I have
a huda beauty palette and then I have
some my favorite products here to wear
for you guys so yeah we're just gonna
kind of wing it and see what we come up
with if you aren't already subscribed be
sure to hit that subscribe button before
you leave and turn on the post
notification so you don't miss a video
because obviously YouTube doesn't like
to tell people when videos are uploaded
anymore so if you want to know when I
post just turn on those notifications
and yeah let's just go ahead start
playing with makeup and have some fun if
you want to see the look that I come up
with then let's just go ahead and get
started I kind of went back and forth
with what I wanted to do for this video
because I was thinking of like a smoked
out wing the liner I kind of wanted to
do something with glitter it's really
hard for me to decide what I want to do
but I washed my hair today and I feel
like a whole new woman we tell you guys
I'm actually wearing a bra today
normally I wear sticky bras because I
hate the way bras field mainly okay this
we're getting into a different topic but
I feel like some of you can relate to me
okay so I'm at 36d and I hate wearing
bras with padding like I am well I'm
always like I don't need the extra
padding like stop giving me more because
I don't want bigger boobs I just if
anything I'd want my boobs to go down
like a full size but I finally found my
favorite bra a bra that I feel sexy it
looks really good it gives just a little
bit of volume right here like I'm not
trying to have them up to my you know
chin so I found a new bra from
Victoria's Secret I was like okay I'll
try it it's like just a lace bra there's
no padding whatsoever it does have like
underwire but that's what gives you that
lift and it it's cute I'm gonna get down
below for you guys cuz it's seriously
like my favorite new bra but it still
feels like like I'm supported but I'm
still kind of free I don't know how we
got in this conversation but I figured I
would share it with you I'm really
excited I'm wearing it today so I'm
going to take these Smashbox
photo-finish lid primer in light so I'm
messy because one of my wife
foundations broke in my makeup bag and
got all over everything I'm moving on
I'm using the huda beauty textured
shadows palette in rose gold I do really
like this palette you have to use your
fingers with these which I'm kind of
over that phase now I kind of actually
don't mind mainly because I don't have
nails anymore
at least for right now but I love the
mattes in this palette and I just think
they're so Valentine's Day I'm going to
use the shade Bay and I'm going to put
this all over my lid I really like
hooter beauty's products I think she has
awesome stuff so taking it all the way
in the inner corner and I'm really just
making sure that that primer is set now
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to take
the shade sandalwood here in the palette
right here and this is gonna be our
transition shade i'm using a sigma
tapered blending a 35 and i will be
putting this into my crease so i'm just
gonna kind of fade this out quite a bit
i like this color a lot this is one of
my favorite colors so i'm actually gonna
go into this Smashbox trio right here
and i'm gonna take this shape and this
is the pick me trio and the one I'm
using is fever dream which is the matte
and I'm going to just put this into my
crease right below that transition shade
and this is gonna add just that little
hint of mauve we might lose it with the
rest of the stuff we're about to put on
but I figured it wouldn't hurt just to
throw it in the crease now what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna go in with bossy
you guys we're playing with quite a bit
of mauve tones today and I'm again I'm
gonna take this Y on the outer half and
bring it in like so it's a really pretty
color nice way to deepen up your look
without going in with like a black then
I'm gonna take a more stiff brush this
is the Mac 239 s I'm gonna go in with
cocoa I'm actually just gonna take this
one all over my lid
now I'm kind of going back and forth I'm
gonna make this cocoa and bossy it's a
little bit more of that
the more that mob and just gonna put
this all over it's a little bit patchy
let me use a different brush instead I'm
going to go over the mac 242 with those
same two shades and see how they apply
also kind of just carving out my crease
with these colors
so just take a few times to really get
it nice and opaque there we go that one
looks better
I just like to tilt my head back just
see where I should cut that crease now
I'm gonna go back in with that Smashbox
trio and that matte shade in there and
I'm just going to blend out the edges of
these eye shadows really lightly I'm
using the Sigma small tapered blending
brush for this very lightly just
blending this out hopefully it blends
out
same with this side just very lightly
now I'm going to take a clean blending
brush this is the Mac 217 again I have
like so many of these and I'm just gonna
go on the edges and just blend this out
nicely I think what I'm gonna do now
actually is I'm gonna go in with the
black which is black truffle and I'm
going to use what I want to use you can
use this pencil brush yes and I'll go on
with the black so that we're nice and
precise I'm just taking it right on the
tip and I'm gonna bring it right here
and the outer V so I'm just gonna
lightly take this into the crease like
that
so you can see it just kind of deepened
it up a bit the same on this side I kind
of do like a little V right here in the
outer corner and then I tilt my head
back and just really take it into that
crease really lightly taking that black
in there so what I did now is they went
back in with that color from the
Smashbox palette and I just lightly went
over that black just to kind of blend it
a bit mo I am going to use my
heart-shaped tape and I'm gonna dot some
on the back of my hand and we're gonna
carve out our eyes so I'm gonna take
some of my brush again I kind of like to
tilt my head back just a little bit and
I'm going to just kind of carve out and
drag down I saw nikkietutorials do this
and now I want to try it
I am no nikkietutorials but we're still
gonna test always done like the halo eye
where it's just like boom right here but
I haven't done one where you take the
line down and then like do the little
edges right here
you know I'm saying okay I don't think
it's exactly like Nicky's but that's
what we're gonna do I kind of like that
all right let's move on think I want to
take this one right here I'm gonna put
this more towards my lash line put this
on this part
that's pretty then I'm gonna take a
lighter one which I'm going to use steel
'as smokey storm this is a very pretty
color and I'm just gonna put this there
and I'm actually I kinda want to mix I'm
gonna put this in here kind of have a
gradient so this is the purple in the
palette or in the trio okay now what I'm
gonna do is I'm going to take that brush
back with that glitter Shay we use that
I'm really gonna make this this area
right here pretty pointy that's kind of
pretty
okay I don't hate it I actually kind of
enjoy it but the only thing I do want to
do is take what's left over with that
pink
just kind of take it right here like
just a few little specks right there
kind of like it looks pretty I went from
like that Halfmoon type thing to mostly
glitter but I couldn't help myself I
didn't really like those of smokey storm
kind of taking over the crease I liked
more of the pink showing through
especially for Valentine's Day so I like
that it kind of still did the moon shape
but you get more pink and you get a lot
of glitter what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna finish this eye off-camera put my
lashes on lashes actually for lashes I'm
gonna use these from Lily lashes these
are meet caramel I love these lashes
they're so pretty
really nice and wispy I'm gonna put
these on after and then I'll be right
back and we'll start on our face
oh okay so we've got the lashes on as
you guys can see I did this I I really
like the way that this turned out I
think it looks really pretty okay so now
I'm gonna move on and do my primer so
this is the Smashbox primer water and
nothing changed here's also gonna use
the soap &amp;amp; Glory one heck of a blot
primer okay so today I'm going to be
using the new a NARS natural radiant
long wear foundation I don't think I've
used it in a video yet but I really love
this foundation thinking I'm gonna be
this one this is in vanu venue a -
vanilla - I know what - I don't know you
know I haven't used this shape before
but I feel like this will be my shade
for today what I'm gonna do is pumps
them on the back of my hand
and I'm gonna take my Beauty Blender and
I'm gonna pounce this all over my skin
to get a nice flawless base I love this
foundation because it's full coverage
but it's also lightweight it's just a
damn good foundation all that redness
just disappear goodbye feel like I mean
my favorite part of makeup is the face
makeup I love watching my redness just
disappear I think it is just so fun so
now I'm gonna go in with heart-shaped
tape in light neutral and I'm going to
put this under my eyes right here in
this inner corner and we're gonna
brighten this up so we're just gonna
finish up also going to use this Kat Von
D deep brush and I am going to blend out
in the inner corner where that concealer
is because this is gonna help kind of
brighten this area up and not make you
look so tired when you do a really
intense smoky eye it's so important to
put some concealer in here because it's
just really gonna brighten it up so I'm
gonna take this peach perfect powder
from Too Faced I've mentioned this
before it's one of my favorite powders
to set my makeup with and I'm going to
put some of this under my eyes first
with the beauty sponge or a Beauty
Blender because it is a Beauty Blender
so this one does have like a little bit
of a peachy tint to it that's why I like
it
I just got a lot of that mmm oh good
at some point there has to be a time
where I've ingested way too much of this
and it's just not healthy anymore I mean
it wouldn't know what the healthy in the
first place but I'm gonna take this big
powder brush
take just a tad of that powder and hit
where I'm gonna be putting bronzer and
contour just so it's all nice and set
moving on to bronzer I'm gonna be using
the urban decay beached bronzer in
bronze this is a gorgeous bronzer bronze
back cheek again into contour I'm going
to be using this palette that I got from
TJ Maxx it's the profusion contour
palette I love this thing you've
probably heard me talk about numerous
times I'm gonna use this color right
here and I'm gonna contour my cheekbones
it's gonna contour lightly when I say
lightly I mean just with a light hand
blush I'm going to be using a toasted
cinnamon from the Burt's Bees I really
like this color a lot I think it's
really pretty now I'm gonna go over the
anasazi a glow kit and sugar I'm gonna
make starburst and marshmallow these two
it's been a minute since I used this so
I'm really excited
my favorite glow kit that has ever come
out
I just can't hold myself living on to
browse I am gonna use my makeup
revolution brow pomade I love this stuff
I say all the time I'm almost out of it
so I need to purchase another one but
I'm gonna go ahead fill in my brows and
then we'll come back and we'll finish
off this makeup look you want to just
take marshmallow actually and just put
it right underneath the arch of the brow
again I'm just gonna put this like right
underneath the arch and kind of just
fade it out to the rest of the brow
really just make that brow pop I'm gonna
go in with bossy in this palette right
there and I'm gonna push this up against
that lower lash line just make sure you
connect it to that wing just so it all
kind of flows I'm gonna take a black
liner this one I'm gonna use this from
cargo ya cargo Cosmetics is in the shade
black sea so I'm gonna put this on my
waterline then I'm going to do is take
my pencil brush so I'm gonna use that
matte shade in this matchbox palette and
blend out that lower lash line
and then what I'm going to do is move on
to lips and I'm going to use this
Patrick Starr lip liner in edge-to-edge
just was his collab with Mac have two
liquid lips from a flower Beauty so I'm
gonna use this one all over and then
this one in the center one I'm using all
