today I filmed it get ready with me on
this look also showed you guys how I put
in my extensions and like hid my short
hair it's kind of like my go-to thing
that I do now I have a lot of hair so
whenever I wear these extensions I do
have to kind of hide certain pieces I'm
going to show you guys how I did that
today I'm also showing you how i got
this makeup look and not my self tanning
I really love this makeup look it's kind
of like a staple for me when it's like
fall winter time and it's really cold
outside and today I was wearing like a
burgundy jacket in my outfit post and I
just wanted to do a dark lip because I
love a feeling very dark and vampy it's
just my favorite and especially when
it's cold outside I know that this
makeup looks nothing crazy spectacular
cool you know it's just I don't know I
just haven't been feeling really
inspired or like haven't seen anything
to really try out that's different and I
always used the same technique on my eye
shake just because I have a little bit
of a hundred eye so I just do my own
kind of technique to make sure it looks
good
on my eyes but if you guys have any
makeup inspo that you want to send me

right next to it and that will get you
notified every time I upload a video so
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this look
and I hope you enjoyed the video you
want to see how I did this makeup look
and did my extensions and put them in
then let's just go ahead and get started
okay so first step I'm going to prime my
eyes with this NARS eyeshadow primer and
then we're going to add some tape to the
corners of our eyes just make it easy to
have a nice sharp line then going into
this makeup revolution palette I'm just
going to take a nice cream shade and set
that primer in place
now I'm using the Natasha de Nonna star
palette and I'm going to use this shade
right here and put this into my crease
this is going to be the transition shade
that I'm going to use to go towards my
brow so I'm going to fluff this into the
crease and a little bit above the crease
and we don't want to go above this color
whenever we're putting on the rest of
our I shadow 'he's moving onto this one
right here it's just a little bit darker
and a little bit more cool tone I'm
going to focus is right in the crease
again not going above that first shade
that we put on but I'm just fluffing it
right there in the crease again not
being too precise this is just going to
add a little bit of definition and to
deepen up the crease a little bit more
I'm going to take a smaller blending
brush again with a dark brown eyeshadow
and go in the crease as well not going
above those two shades that we just put
on then I'm going to take the first
shade we use and just blend out the
edges just so we don't have any harsh
lines
moving on to the makeup revolution
palette again I'm going to use that
black and a small dense fluffy brush I'm
going to make a V in my outer V so I'm
just going to do a little bit of black
in my crease and a little bit right
there at my upper lash line so first I'm
going to quickly blend out the edges of
my eyeshadow and then I'm going in with
the glitter glue and I'm going to put
this all over my lid I always like to
use this when I'm using a really
glittery pigmented eyeshadow just so it
sticks and really pops on the eyelid so
I'm going to take these two shades in
the star palette and just pop them onto
the lid as well and then repeat the
process on the other eye
then I'm going to take my brush that was
the smallest one that I used with the
dark brown and I didn't put any
additional product on I just used
whatever was left on the brush and
blended out the edges of the glitter
eyeshadow
then we're going to do a winged eyeliner
which I rarely do anymore which is crazy
I'm using the makeup forever a matte
liquid liner and I'm just going to
create a wing with this after that I
just popped on some lashes from I'll or
I'll leave down below what they are and
then I'm going to prime my face I'm
going to use Smashbox primer water and
then the cane and Austin mattifying
primer as well this is a great primer to
neutralize some redness and to fill in
your pores going in with my foundation
as dangerous likes to call it this is V
Sonia Kashuk satin matte foundation and
I'm going to blend this on my face with
a japonesque Beauty Blender really love
this you can get it from Ulta they have
like a little gift set with a smaller
sponge and a cleanser for $18 it's
really nice I highly recommend it I
think you can only get it online but if
you find it in store definitely snag it
then I'm taking the Maybelline fit me
concealer and I'm going to put this
underneath my eyes and in the center of
my face to conceal and also brighten
these areas
after that I'm going to set with my
flower beauty powder in lo1 I love this
powder I think it's amazing it really
gives you an airbrushed look to the skin
so I like to bake with this and it just
melts in the skin beautifully and it
dusts away just amazing so after that
I'm going to do my brows I'm using the
Benefit kabrel
I'm just going to breeze right through
this because my brows I feel like take a
while and I don't really change them up
too much I just fill them in the shape
that they are and that's about it and
I'll just set them with this Anasazi
brow gel in brunette then I'm going to
take this Too Faced brush and dust away
the baking that we did and then going in
with my favorite drugstore bronzer i'm
using the Neutrogena help these skins
little multicolored bronzer it's amazing
gives you a nice warm tan look and I'm
just going to bronze my face with this
and the brush I'm using is by Tom Ford
taking this elf pressed mineral bronzer
I'm going to contour with it this has a
nice actually undertone to it so I like
to contour with this it is pretty dark
so just use a light hand but it does
blend out really well for blush I'm
using my favorite one that I can't get
enough of it's the ultimate blush in
princess this is my go-to blush I just
love it honestly I haven't used anything
else ever since I got this because I'm
just addicted to it then I'm going to
blend it out with my duo fiber brush and
then to highlight I'm using this essence
highlighter that is amazing see pure
nude highlighter in B my highlight and
I'm just going to apply that with this
Sephora brush and this this highlighter
is really great if you have larger pores
as well and if you accidentally go over
your pores this doesn't accentuate them
or anything like that it's a really nice
smooth powder and it doesn't have a lot
of glitter or anything like that in it
I'm going to use my NARS eyeliner in Via
Veneto and I'm going to put this on my
waterline and then I couldn't decide
what color and I decide to go with this
one right here and I'm going to brush
this up against my lower lash line to
really smoke this look out
and then taking the first Shay we use
I'm going to just blend out the edges of
that just so it's not a harsh stark line
underneath after that I'm going to apply
some mascara on my bottom lashes I'm
using the benefit roller lash then I'm
going to highlight with the highlighter
that we use on our face I'm just going
to put that underneath my brows that is
the eyes and we're going to move on to
lips I believe this is the true Brown
Kay lip liner from Kylie cosmetics Kylie
has really great lip liners they're
really nice and smooth and very
pigmented so I went ahead and filled in
most of my lips with this lip color and
then I'm going to go in with another
Sephora crema lip stain I love these
I've been using them constantly and this
is in the shade 14 and then after you do
your lips your whole face is completely
done I hope you guys like this look I
really loved it it was so vampy and it
just looked amazing in pictures
moving on to hair I use the foxy locks
ombre extensions and honey spice they're
my favorite I've been using them for so
long ever since I started going lighter
with my hair these are the ones that I
use and they match really well the brown
doesn't really match my brown but with
my hair down you can't even tell so I'm
going to section off a small layer I'll
show you right here when I turn around I
like to take this layer and just tie it
up you'll see I do everything else
pretty much as normal but I always tie
this layer up because this always shows
the most whenever I wear extensions so
after I tie that up I'm going to put a
three clip weft in and then I curl as I
go so whenever I like the next section
down and put that hair extension in I'll
curl my hair with the hair extensions I
didn't show that full process in this
video just because it would have been
forever but the whole key is to just
curl your hair with the extensions and
then at the end I show you how I tuck
away and hide some of my shorter hair
just so you can't see it in the
extensions I have the most problems with
the pieces that I have framing my face I
usually have to pin those back which
you'll see but I do everything else as
you know you normally would with hair
extensions I just sectioned down a
little bit of hair clip in an extension
and then curl them these are my favorite
extensions I do have a coupon code if
you want to check them out down below
and then we got to my final top layer
and this is when I just wait on put
extensions in I go ahead and curl my top
layer and then I'll add in more after
I'm done curling it just to see my right
side is thicker I have more hair on that
side so I have to put more extensions on
that side so you can see I have one
right there but once I style it
hairspray you won't be able to see that
track in my hair but right here I'm
going to section this little part over
and I'm going to add a couple hair
extensions right in here just to add
some length in here because I do have a
lot of shorter layers
in this section so I'm just going to add
to one clip weft curl those and then
flip that section back over I'm using a
new me one it's a thirty two millimeter
one which is just a one and a half inch
barrel so after that I like to brush
through it and get it kind of styled how
I would want to wear it and then this is
a time where you can see right there my
shorter pieces are at in the front this
is when I take these shorter pieces and
I will twist them and I just keep
twisting them until they eventually roll
up into this little ball and then what I
do is I use long bobby pins I highly
recommend long bobby pins unless you
have really short hair because the long
bobby pins you can put more hair in and
it's just easier and they hold a lot
better so I highly recommend them so
they're thick and they're really tight
so your hair is not going to fall out of
these bobby pins so you can see how long
this bobby pin is I mean it's insane I
just do that with the pieces I don't
like I'll just go through put my hair
forward and like this piece right here
you can just really tell that it's
shorter hair so I just twist it up and
then put it in the back of my head and
then I just pin it down if you pin it
towards the back of your neck you're not
going to be able to see any of the
pieces that you pin because this these
extensions are a lot of hair and
somebody would have to really dig
through them to see all the pieces use
you pin back then the last thing I like
to do is just tease the crown of my head
and that's to cover any extensions and
add some extra volume and then you are
done so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video thank you so much for watching and
I will see you all in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
