doing a tested out Thursday on this
color me flawless in a finish automatic
foundation applicator this is the Pro
Edition it says it's an all-in-one sonic
applicator for eight hours superior
coverage so this is what the front of
the box looks like and then you open it
up and has this and it usually has the
product right here but I went ahead and
took it out says it's a Beauty Blender a
little brush your hands all in one
product basically it's supposed to give
you really flawless coverage and even on
the back it has this example of fine
foundation and the flawless foundation
which I mean but I wanted to try this
out because I remember when I first
started tested out Thursday's asked you
guys for requests and this was one of
the most requested items and I was like
what is that that looks so weird so I
figured I would finally try it out so I
took it out of the box this is what it
looks like just a little handheld device
and then you also get an extra sponge
first thing I will say is this is a lot
smaller than I thought it was going to
be I thought maybe the size of this
metal cap even bigger but it's actually
a little bit smaller so that's what it
looks like right there if you were to
just take this and round it out it's a
little bit smaller than a quarter it
feels really soft I like that it does
come with a cap for sanitary purposes
and what we're going to do is we're just
gonna hop into this video I'm ready to
apply foundation I did go ahead and put
on moisturizer I used this glam glow
glow starter mega illuminating
moisturizer which I'm a big fan of this
it smells really strong and it smells
like the varsity like the orange drink
at the varsity I forget what they call
it but at the varsity here in Atlanta
they have this orange drink and I used
to love it as a kid but if I had it now
I would probably throw up everywhere
because I'm not used to having such
sweet things but yeah I don't really
like this but it really didn't wash dry
as my skin so my skin feels good
I just wouldn't say I would use it again
it says pull the white battery tab which
is this right here we're going to do
this together because if you have this
we can just do it together and figure it
out and then it says lift cap to reveal
oops
already did that the Pro Edition
Universal sponge for powder or liquid o
for powder or liquid
it says applying foundation directly to
sponge with with liquid foundation be
sure to season the fresh sponge ie cover
it with full coat foundation and apply
oh and add another pump with powder
foundation you could Pat these sponge
directly onto your compact or lid of
your jar then shake off excess I brought
over my Maybelline a better skin
foundation and you guys know I love this
it's a great foundation so I believe my
towel since I have to saturate the
sponge also if you're wondering what's
on my eyes right now it's the Too Faced
the power of makeup I just use the matte
shadows in here they blend it so well
and this is what my favorite looks to
rock just a really smoky outer corner in
a light inner corner I don't know just
my favorite a matte eyeshadow look I
just love it and got this choker from
forever 21 so I'm going to pump one pump
Foundation put this all over the sponge
just saturate it I guess that's just so
your first layer foundation doesn't like
seep into the sponge completely you get
around the edges as well so that's that
and then ensure skin is moisturize push
button to activate devices sonic tapping
action start at cheek move device in
gentle sweeping motions it's not
necessary to rub or press hard blend
jawline upward to forehead and hairline
use narrow tip for nose build coverage
okay I'm going to try this how they say
to try it but I'm also going to try it
how I want to try it so and if you guys
had missed it I did do a review on the
Clinique vibrating foundation sonic
thing or whatever they came out with an
attachment for foundation a lot of
people were mad at me in that video
because they're like it's a skincare
product that's just an attachment that's
why I was so expensive but if you didn't
have the skincare attachment I mean and
you had to buy the whole thing thinking
it would be great for foundation it's
kind of a bust so push a button to
activate device which the button is
right here hmm you hear it oh my gosh
foundation is dripping already okay I'm
just gonna put that on my face and it
says
start at cheek move device and gentle
sweeping motions
I'm not pressing hard at all this is to
blend upward but I really need to blend
it down so it sounds like I'm pressing
so hard but I'm not what does this
remind me of some massaging device don't
get dirty you guys I feel like it's
blending it very well and it's getting
like right here in the corner on the
edge of my nose really well but the
foundation is breaking up on my nose I
know you guys can see that
so one kind of foundation did do both
sides but not my forehead so I'm going
to take like I'm going to turn it off
because it started getting on the side
once I turn it on so I'm just going to
take like a half a pump and then put
this on my forehead
you
and then I'm going to try to go over my
nose one more time with a little bit of
foundation not even that much like I
need a tiny bit just to see if he'll
cover it back up because it was
separating which it normally doesn't do
with this foundation maybe it's because
it's super dry I don't know yeah I think
it's peeling but it's kind of separating
on my nose okay so that is the
application with this product I do kind
of feel like I used quite a bit of
product to start all I just to get my
whole face covered and even though it is
small it did kind of blend everything
out fairly quickly I was actually really
impressed by it and I do like the
vibrating sensation of it I guess it
sounds kind of weird I really did like
it because it felt like a little massage
and it was just kind of call me I don't
know I didn't even really want to talk
when I was putting on foundation I just
want to like sit there and do this with
it I think it did blend everything
really nicely I use this foundation with
a Beauty Blender or a brush and this is
definitely the outcome I would get
either way I can't say it applies it
much more flawlessly I think it applied
it flawless anyways I'm going to go
ahead and put my concealer on and the
rest of my face makeup and then I'll be
back to do an update for you guys I
don't know if I'm going to do an hourly
update because this isn't necessarily
like an hourly product even though it
says for eight hours superior coverage I
don't have a problem with this
foundation wearing off so I can't decide
if I want to do an hourly update or not
and my s you guys really quick on
snapchat and C so I'm going to go ahead
and finish the rest of my face makeup
and I will be right back to update you
guys okay so I asked you guys on
snapchat if you wanted me to do updates
throughout the day with this color me
product and you guys said yes one of you
said that I should have used another
tool half of my face which I totally
agree I didn't even think about it
I guess because there was so much
product on this side that I felt like I
had to hurry up and get it over to this
side so I will be doing updates it's
already a little bit late right now but
I will just go ahead and do the update
throughout the night because I will
probably be up a little bit late today
by the way I'm digging this look I did
try a different colors lip on my statue
and it was so cool the Smashbox chill
zone
I love these liquid lipsticks so much
but what I have on right now is True
Grit and True Grit is going to be my
color for winter I love it it's just a
really deep brown but I did put this on
first and then this on top and just gave
it more of a cool toned Brown but I want
to quickly do like a little recap on
this I do have to say my foundation
looks pretty flawless like over my pores
and everything it's not like sunken in
or anything which I love this foundation
anyways I think is amazing but I think
it looks extra amazing on my face today
I'm not judging my forehead with this
product because it is peeling and it's
ugly and we're not going to talk about
it okay it was really bad I really like
the way that it looks I think it was
nice to apply it was easy if I'm in a
rush this is probably not the product
that I will go for because it does take
a little bit of time but what I say to
go purchase this $100 product or to buy
a $20 beauty blender it's kind of like
one of those things where I'm definitely
going to keep using this but I'm on the
fence about it because I don't want to
tell you to buy a hundred dollar product
when you could just go buy a beauty
blender and blend out your foundation
this is definitely for people who just
love to experiment with different things
and love kind of like little cool
gadgets like this I definitely think
it's something to try out I think it's
pretty awesome I did purchase this my
own money by the way yeah so far I
really really like it I think my
drugstore foundation looks pretty damn
high-end so so far I'm loving it and I
do recommend it and again I love the
fact that they have a little cap for
this this is completely different from
the clinic vibrating sponge applicator
that I tried I will link that video down
below this is completely different it's
ten times better and I would recommend
this one over the clinic attachment
gadget any day loving this so far I also
love the fact that they included this
little extra sponge anyways
right now it is 6:17 and I'm going to go
throughout my night probably take this
lip color off because I want to eat
something very soon and yeah I will see
you guys in just a couple hours hey guys
so it is currently 1143 not too far out
or bellick with five or six hours I
can't remember what time I showed you
guys earlier I'm really tired
honestly I'm like ready to wrap this up
and go to
but I know I'm going to be able to do
like a lot of updates throughout the
video is a foundation applicator and
it's kind of one of those first
impression type of things just to see
how it works and if it does blend really
well as you guys saw it did I really
liked it I think it's an awesome product
if you're someone who likes to apply it
quick get it over with get it done get
out the door this is not the product for
you because it does take quite a bit
longer to apply the foundation that the
guys website is product out I will leave
a link for it down below with the price
where I got it all that kind of stuff I
feel like with this foundation it looks
amazing as it is like with a Beauty
Blender and a brush but this product
made it glide over my pores even more
and it just makes it look so flawless if
you guys have tried this product let me
know down below in the comments what you
thought and I would love to hear it any
of your suggestions anything like that I
will update you guys with this I'm going
to try it out with a couple different
things so I will update you in my what
month are we honest I love thinking
about August hits and misses on how well
it applied everything else but for
foundation it's awesome thank you guys
so much for watching I hope you enjoyed
this tested out Thursday and I will see
you all in my next video which is
actually tomorrow bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
