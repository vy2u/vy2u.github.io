tried out Thursday and this Thursday we
are actually trying the Clinique sonic
system and it basically says it's an
airbrushed finish liquid foundation
applicator I had it so many of you asked
me if I was gonna do a first impression
on this and I was like yes of course it
will especially since the last ride out
Thursday I tried out this little thing
so if you want to see how this worked I
will leave that video down below and
somewhere in this video I'll like leave
a card or something up here figured I
would try this out this is more
expensive than that brush this was I
believe eighty nine ninety and I don't
know why it's so expensive but it was it
says Clinique now lets you pair your
favorite liquid foundation with our
first sonic foundation applicator for a
flawless looking skin but we're just
going to open this I ordered it from
Clinique and I wanted to get this in
before it went on vacation and as most
of you know as most of you know I'm
going to be out of town a couple months
so I'm pre filming so many videos and I
wanted to get this up this Thursday
actually because I want to try it out
see if it worked
see if I should take it traveling with
me you know just just see so has a
really nice box feels really good I love
like glossy boxes like this oh they do
they're just so pretty do I have to
charge this I'm gonna be mad I think I
do she charged put on the charge paste
on a dry damnit
let's see if this is charged at all cuz
you know some people charge things ahead
of time so we're just going to have to
unplug the lights in the background and
see how this is but it comes with this
little charging system the booklet and
then the product so this just pops off
and you have this like little sponge
thing ooh I don't even know it's charged
thank you gonna see if it's fully
charged though so I'm going to unplug my
lights really quickly and we're just
going to see this how charged this
sucker is
oh this is definitely first impression
for you guys to charge place the
charging base on a dry hard flat surface
near properly functioning wall outlet
blah blah blah and fold the car supply
cord Josefa link insert the plug into
the wall eyelet place the clinique sonic
airbrush finishing whatever facing
forward this has no significance until
its units until it's units operate at
the copy over charge I'm sorry where
where am I seeing this light
ah well am I supposed to have this on or
off this is difficult I think the boss
oh there it is okay so it's blinking
which means it's recharging so I'm going
to go ahead and do my eye makeup since
it's already a little bit charged I'm
gonna do my eye makeup come back and
we're going to try this out I might even
do my hair depending on how long this
takes but it's just like a faint one if
you guys can see it it's like a really
faint blinking right here the lights are
kind of washing out but it's very very
faint you can barely see it obviously
because it took me forever to figure out
it was charging so I'm going to wait
until it's green I'll show you guys when
it's green and I will come back to
finish this try it out Thursday oh Lord
I hope this is good so hard struggling
I'm struggling okay so I'm back it's
been like an hour hour and a half I
ended up putting my extensions in if you
guys want to know extensions I use I'll
leave them down below my curled them a
little bit I did my eye makeup and I've
been waiting for this thing to be on
fully green once it has a fully green
little symbol that it's done and it's
still blinking orange or Tunisia's
charging but I'm going to go ahead and
do this because I don't have a lot of
time and I'm running out of daylight so
we're just going to go ahead and work
with it then we're going to start we
using this it says for best results use
your clinic sonic system airbrushed
finish liquid foundation applicator on
clean skin prepped with moisturizer and
or primer you do need to pry my skin I
have so much hair in right now like look
at all this this is so much hair I'm
going to take my regular primers I'm
just going to prime my face
a so I've got my primer on so the next
thing it says sponge head works best if
you let it gently glide over skin
there's no need to apply pressure press
the button to stop the sponge head or
sponge head will automatically turn off
after 30 seconds to restart your sponge
head simply press the button again dot
your favorite Clinique liquid foundation
of white cheeks and chin for highly
fluid liquid foundations pour a small
amount into the palm of your hand dip
the sponge head into the foundation for
cream foundations dip the sponge
directly into the cream gently massage
sponge head over entire face blending
foundation from the center of the face
outwards after each use cleaning sponge
head with soap and water and rinse
thoroughly shake off excess water to
allow air dry before next use but
basically we want to work from the
center out and just not apply a lot of
pressure which is crazy
so I'm going to go ahead and go in with
the Clinique beyond perfecting
foundation this is in the shade 7 I'm
hoping this will work for me because I
feel like I just got super light
overnight so we're just gonna hope that
this works this is probably way too late
so I'm sorry I'm just thankful I did
okay so we'll just have to bronze if
this is like really light but you just
want to take it off press this so oh my
god um
oh no I need to do this what that's it
it's supposed to be done in 30 seconds
like that no mm-hmm maybe okay it says
gently massage sponge head over first
off this is not gliding smoothly they
say not to apply a lot of pressure which
I'm not but trying to massage it into my
skin without any pressure is like not
happening and I'm not liking the fact
that it's automatically shutting off
after 30 seconds that's really annoying
like I should be able to control what it
goes off I'm not liking this I'll just
say oh right now I feel like this gives
me less coverage me I feel like it is
blending the foundation in but it's
taking away the coverage it's it's weird
because there's a dead skin what is that
if you guys can see that but there's
like little particles on my hand you
can't tell if it's dead skin or not or
if it's just sponge probably cuz I
didn't wash it like I've been saying it
says to just let it glide over your skin
it is so hard for this to glide over
your skin in my opinion for some reason
it's just like stiff and it just isn't
working out as well as I thought it
would let's see if we can build up a
foundation let's see if we can just
possibly do that with this product
because I have rosacea
I got ish to cover and let's be real
this didn't do it the first time around
I do not like it on my nose at all see
when I hear massage I think this and
then it's just so difficult to do that
in my opinion like it takes a lot more
effort than I want to do again it's just
taking the foundation off of my nose I
feel like this sponge is soaking up a
lot of the foundation this is a pretty
full coverage foundation I've done two
reviews with this foundation I've done
one on the foundation and one with the
spinny brush that I showed you guys in
the beginning in this video and it has
pretty good coverage and I feel like
this is kind of taking it away on my
nose it's just not helping it at all it
did obviously blend in the foundation to
my skin let's get a good close-up before
I start talking I mean it did blend
everything over my skin I mean it kind
of looks like you don't have foundation
on your face which is great but then
again this is a great foundation but it
keeps taking away my foundation and I
feel like I'm going to have to keep
applying more and applying more when you
use the blend smart the first time
around it covers everything
automatically you don't have to keep
going back in and adding foundation so
like the first application that I
applied with my foundation that's
usually all I have to do for my blend
smart and I'm done I don't have to go in
three times with this foundation and try
to touch it up I want to know have you
guys tried this let me know what you
think let me know if you think I'm
should try something else with this
personally I feel like I should return
it it's 8990 and I don't feel like this
gives me amazing flawless skin it
doesn't have a WOW factor to it in my
opinion maybe if you have really great
skin and you don't need a lot of
coverage you might like this and you
might like the vibrating benefits of it
I guess so I'm going to finish up my
makeup real quick and a bronze my skin
because I need it because that
foundation was super light but I'm gonna
be right back after I finished my makeup
and I will wrap up this video for you
guys okay so I'm back in my face is done
and everything applied pretty well I'm
not like super happy with the way my
foundation looks but it's on and
we're moving on so as you guys saw
obviously I'm not a big fan of this I
feel like you could just use a brush or
a beauty blender or the Belen smart
brush and you would be fine you don't
have to purchase this I think it soaks
up way too much product and to me it's
really not that fun to apply it kind of
itches my face with how much vibration
it has like this on your face the whole
time it's just kind of itchy I also
don't like the fact that it shuts off in
30 seconds I don't know about you guys
but it doesn't take me only 30 seconds
to do my foundation even though I know
you can press it back on I still think
that the user should determine when it
should go off I know this is such a
negative review and I'm sorry but
honestly I mean I tried these things out
and these higher priced items out for
you guys to save you money and to just
kind of give you my opinion and how I
feel about the product to me first
impressions are everything if something
sucks the first time I try it I'm
probably not going to try it again
because I don't know I'm just a very big
first impressions kind of girl I'm sorry
this is kind of a negative review but it
was just my honest opinion and I hope
you guys take it for what it's worth if
you have tried it again please tell me
if you like it how you use it what you
use it with if you think it's better
with a lighter foundation which I don't
really do a lighter coverage but I mean
if other people are interested in it you
can let them know in the comments but if
you do like tested out Thursdays by the
way I haven't even addressed this I am
starting to do tested out Thursdays
