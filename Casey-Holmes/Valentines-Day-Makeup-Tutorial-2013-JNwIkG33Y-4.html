a Valentine's Day makeup tutorial now I
know a bunch of people are doing a more
of the natural kind of look for
Valentine's Day but I wanted to pop a
color for my lips so I third I go with
this really bright pink lipstick for
Maybelline that I have really been
loving it's from the Maybelline Vivid's
collection and I have a couple colors
from this collection and I'm really in
love with it but I think this one's my
favorite because it's just so Barbie
pink and so pretty this one is called
fuchsia flash and that's just what it
looks like it's literally a Barbie pink
color so it's obviously really bright so
what I did is I did a neutral matte eye
and I just did some winged liner a
little something different with the
liner on the waterline and some half
lashes and kind of amped up the lip a
bit with some highlighting and lip gloss
and I'm done so I hope you guys enjoy
this it's just a fun look and I really
really like it so if you want to see
that tutorial then just keep watching it
is a talk-through by the way and I know
a lot of you really like those so I'm
sorry if this is a little long I'm
pretty sure it will be a little long and
I'm gonna go ahead and answer questions
about my hair I used my nume reversed
wand and it's just as smaller and it
tapers out to a bigger wand
and I really like it in a video one and
a few months back and I figured I hadn't
broke it out in a while so I just tried
to use it today I really like the look
that it gave as always I do have $110
off coupon for individual wants all that
stuff for new me down below I hope you
guys have a very happy Valentine's Day
remember it's not always about having a
boyfriend or a husband you can go out
with your girls and have a ton of fun so
I hope you guys have a very happy and
fun Valentine's Day and I hope you guys
enjoyed this look don't forget to like
the video if you liked it and I will see
you guys in my next one bye okay so the
first thing I'm gonna do is apply
foundation and I absolutely love this
foundation is from the drugstore having
really talked about it much but it's the
covergirl clean foundation and I have
this on manual focus so I don't know how
well you guys will be able to see but
this is what looks like it just kind of
has like the blue
packaging if you guys don't know I do
self tan and my face gets wider a lot
quicker than the rest of my body dies so
my foundations are usually always darker
than my face
alert and they match my neck so I'm
gonna put this in a the T spots on my
face this is a very thick foundation in
the jar but it's not really thick on the
face so it's kind of odd but I really
love this foundation so I'm just going
to pack this all over my skin and this
just gives like a really even coverage I
love this foundation so much and I know
my hands ridiculous I swear to gosh my
hands like hate self-tanner they do not
like it at all
they're the worst parts of my body to
try and salty and evenly I mean I start
going into the spray booth with gloves
on and just doing the self-tan on it
myself because they just don't like them
they don't like the spray tans or the
lotions I don't know why but they're the
hardest part of my body to self-tan it's
ridiculous now I'm going to go in with
my covergirl Olay simply ageless
corrector I love this stuff so much I'm
just going to take my finger and swill
it in there I'm going to Pat this
underneath my eye and I'm gonna also do
this in a triangle motion just Pat it in
I like using my fingers for my under
eyes because I feel like it works a lot
better I take it in the inner corner and
on the lid a little bit as well this
really helps highlight and correct that
under eye it's expensive at the
drugstore but I promise you it's worth
it
I use it every single day ever since
I've purchased it I absolutely love it
okay so that's when I done you can see
the difference that it makes it's insane
I'm going to set my under eye concealer
with this makeup forever super matte
loose powder and for once I'm not gonna
set my whole face with this I'm just
gonna do my under eye okay now I'm gonna
take the Revlon nearly naked powder this
one is in medium and I'm just gonna take
a regular powder brush and I'm just
going to set my face makeup now what I'm
gonna do is in the contour I'm using my
Too Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer with
this brush from Sephora that I
absolutely love and I'm just going to
dab it in there and contour a little bit
I do take a little bit of it and I put
it underneath my bottom lip just to make
it look a little bit more pouty then I'm
gonna take some on top of my forehead
then I'm also gonna just drag a little
bit down my neck and on my chest just to
bronze up my skin a little bit
okay next I'm taking my favorite blush
skinfinish ever from Mac this is stereo
rose it was limited edition I was lucky
enough to get it because an awesome
Twitter follower
I told me that they had it back in stock
on their site and I ended up picking it
up using it pretty much every day so I'm
just gonna take my blush brush and apply
this to my cheeks I love this color it's
so gorgeous start from the back and I
work my way forward gives you just a
pretty rosy tint take a little bit right
above my brows nothing too important but
I like okay now for the eye since we are
doing such a bright lip it is going to
be more neutral the first thing I'm
going to take is this Sigma eyeshadow
base or this cream shadow this is in
pursuade I love this it's very similar
to the Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre I've
actually been using this everyday
instead of my matte pink pot it's pretty
much the same color and it's just
awesome and it creates an amazing base
for your shadows so just taking that all
over the lid going to take my Naked
palette and like I said we keep it very
neutral I want to do mostly matte
shadows on the eye because I just don't
want to do anything crazy for the eyes
because I want my focus to be on the
lips so I'm going to take naked just
just right here kind of a skintone color
a little bit lighter sometimes I'm just
going to put this at my crease just kind
of buffing it in not precise with it or
anything all over from inner corner to
outer corner just don't buff that all in
I would get a phone call right now okay
so anyways I took you from inner corner
to or attic or an inner corner just
pretty much buffing naked all over my
lid then I'm going in with a buck which
is this one it's just a little bit
darker than naked it's still matte and
I'm going to take a blending brush I'm
just going to kind of focus this on the
outer half of my eye and sort of swirl
it in like that so just like that and I
take a little bit in my crease not too
much then you could go back with that
same blending brush that you used and
just blend it out so I'm taking this
revlon matte shadow in peach sorbet I
think I've had this for years literally
and I just can't get rid of it because I
think it's you know just in necessity so
actually you know I should do my brows
to take the Sigma brow powder the medium
one and I'm just taking my little brush
that I got in my Milani brow fix kit and
I'm just taking the lightest shade and
I'm just going to fill in my brows a
little bit this isn't how I do them if
I'm doing like a really dark eye it's
just just what I do when I want to fill
them in really quick nothing too crazy
okay and then what I'm gonna do is take
that revlon matte shadow again cuz I was
gonna take it I'm just going to
highlight underneath my brows then
taking a little bit here in the inner
part of my eyelid just to kind of
brighten it up a little bit I'm actually
gonna go ahead and just take buck on
this same brush and drag this underneath
my lower lashes kind of give that smoky
esque
effect nothing too much
now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take
my liner I'm using the next curved liner
I'm kind of kind of keep the liner
thinner the line at least and then I am
still doing a wing because I love my
wings I'm never not gonna ever do winged
eyeliner because it's just I have very
sad droopy eyes a lot of you say I have
the Britney Spears look and that's
mainly the eyes Britney has the droopy
eyes too and they're Brown as well so
that's where we kind of resemble but
otherwise I don't think we resemble into
straw a thin thin line
you can kind of just press it press it
you can kind just press it against your
lashes and you'll get that thin line you
don't necessarily have to just swipe it
across your lid so you can always just
press it against the lashes and you get
that nice line I'm gonna take it and
extend it out as always two wing
eyeliner is full of q-tips it takes
practice even people like me who have
used eyeliner for so long I still need
more practice and I still have to fix up
my lines half the time but that's what
it looks like just a nice winged out
liner and I'm gonna do the same on the
other side now what I'm gonna do is just
a little bit different I'm gonna add
highlighting stick and the inner part of
my waterline and then do black eyeliner
on the outer parts of my waterline I
take the Mac kohl liner put this
literally on about the outer half of my
waterline then I'm going to take this
matte side of this Sigma brow pencil
tape thing putting this on the inner rim
of my waterline kind of blending it in
with that black so I kind of end up
blending it in just so it's not like a
highlight color and then black I'm gonna
take a little bit more a buck with an
angled shadow or an angled brush and I'm
just going to take this right at the
lower lash line I mean I'm like smudging
it right underneath there it's time for
mascara using the telescopic shocking
extensions mascara it scares the balm do
have a first impression Friday on it if
you're interested okay so these are the
eyes really simple neutral matte loved'
and the mixture between the like lighter
Sol and the darker pencil I feel like
it's not as harsh but there's still some
depth in there that's why I really like
that okay moving on to the rest of my
face I'm going to take my mary lou lou
manizer and i'm gonna take kind of like
that same contour brush just dab the
edges of it then I'm just going to apply
this to the tops of my cheekbones taking
this brow mousse because I forgot to do
it earlier just setting my brows so I'm
letting my mascara dry a little bit
before I put some hot flashes I'm gonna
go ahead and do my lips this is my new
favorite lipstick ever this is well not
ever but this is one of my new favorite
like bright lipsticks I have a feeling
in the summertime with like a super dark
tan zoom like gorgeous is the Maybelline
vivid collection I got three different
colors from there but this one's like my
one of my favorites this isn't fuchsia
flash okay so all I'm gonna do make sure
your lips are moisturize exfoliated
whatever I don't use a lip liner with
this because I don't feel like I need to
but if you want to feel free he's gotten
PI this all over
just like that I feel like it just looks
a little dull on its own so I like to
kind of spice it up a little bit so I'm
gonna take my mary-lou Luminizer taking
my finger taking some of that and
placing it on this inner parts of my
lips just like that taking this Revlon
lip gloss this is in peach petal I don't
care if I use this with a color because
the DOE foot it's pretty gross I really
don't care so just apply this over top I
feel like it just really amps up the
color if you ever feel like you put a
little bit too much highlighting
products on then just kind of Boop go
over it one time dipstick okay now for
the fun part the last part we're adding
false lashes and then we're going to
also just put a little bit eyeliner over
top after that you the glue dries so I'm
using the Ardell accent lashes this will
let the little packaging looks like and
they're number 305 they're just kind of
dramatic little half lashes they're
nothing too crazy but they definitely
add that flare to your eyes to make your
eyes look a little more cat eyed so
taking this and my duo lash glue and I'm
really quickly going to do this off
camera but all I do is just put the glue
on the lashes and let it sit for like 30
seconds let it get tacky and I'll put it
on and I'll be back after I do my lashes
okay guys so I just finished my eye
lashes as you can see it just added some
extra to the look just kind of making
them a little bit more cat I hope you
guys enjoyed this and I'll see you guys
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
