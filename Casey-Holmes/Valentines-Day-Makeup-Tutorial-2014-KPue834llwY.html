a Valentine's Day makeup tutorial I'm
still sick so I'm sorry if I sound a
little nasally in this video because I
cannot shake this cold that I've had for
a while I decided to do this sometimes a
makeup look because I know Valentine's
Day is coming up in ten days and I'm
filming this on the floor I used this
pigment from Mac it's in the color rose
and this is like the pigment that I
think of when I think of Valentine's Day
just because it's that pretty pink gold
color and it looks stunning and I think
it looks stunning on everybody if you
guys want another idea on a Valentine's
Day makeup tutorial that's kind of a
little bit more soft
I'll leave my naked 3 makeup tutorial
down below I think it would be great for
a Valentine's Day date it's a little bit
softer than this I know this one's a
little bit more dramatic so I'll just
leave that down below if you guys want
to check it out thank you guys so much
for watching don't forget to like this
video if you liked it and subscribe to
my channel and I will see you all in my
next video bye first thing I'm going to
do is take my Sigma e-40 and this light
brown shade from the lorac pro mini
palette and I'm going to put this into
my crease just blending it all over and
this is going to be our transition shade
next we're going to take this Too Faced
glitter glue this is an awesome primer
for pigment glitters anything like that
it's a sticky base and it's really gonna
help any pigment or loose product that
you're going to put on your eyes stick
very very well and last all night long
and then taking the macros pigment I'm
going to apply it with this Mac brush I
can't remember the exact number of it
but I'll leave the number and everything
I used in this video down below I'm just
going to pack this pigment onto the lid
now we're taking a nooner from The Naked
3 palette and I'm going to put this into
my crease I'm not really blending it up
or down I'm just mainly focusing this
right into the crease with my Sigma e25
brush now we're going to take black
heart with a pencil brush from Sigma as
well and I'm going to place this in the
outer V and we are going to bring it on
to the lid and a little bit into the
crease as well
after we've placed that product I'm
gonna go ahead and blend this with the
Sigma e25 just make sure you focus this
mainly in the outer half don't bring it
too far onto the lid
now I'm taking a sigma e40 again and I'm
just blending out the choppy lines that
I had in the inner part I'm gonna take
my liquid liner and do a winged eyeliner
and also apply mascara and false lashes
now I'm taking my it cosmetics by by
redness and this Mac brush and I'm going
to lightly apply this over my redness
I've been really loving this product I
could talk about it more in my favorites
video that I just posted so I'll leave
that down below but I love this product
it is absolutely amazing if you have
redness or any problem areas like that
and please excuse the lotion in my hair
I had just put lotion on my chest and I
didn't even realize I got it in my hair
now taking this chanel Matt Lumia in
number 50 and when I apply this with my
kabuki brush it does look a little light
but it does oxidize on my skin so once
it sets you'll see that it does match my
body
taking my mac prolongwear concealer I'm
just going to do my regular concealer
routine
gonna be taking my Sigma f-86 and
blending this out I highly recommend
this brush if you do not have it it is
absolutely one of my favorites and then
I'm going to set my under eye with the
Make Up For Ever super matte loose
powder and also set the rest of my face
makeup
taking my hoola bronzer I'm going to
contour and I'm gonna let you guys just
watch I do have a full contour and
highlighting routine which I will link
down below if you want to see a video
that is more in depth
now I'm going to go ahead and fill in my
brows I'll leave all the products I use
down below and then taking a pencil
brush again from Sigma and that Rose
pigment I'm going to put this around my
tear duct and a little bit on my lower
lash line and then we're gonna go in
with black heart again and put this on
the rest of our lower lash line just to
smoke it out
that is basically it guys I hope you
enjoyed this tutorial please give it a
thumbs up if you did feel free to share
it on your Facebook Twitter Instagram
