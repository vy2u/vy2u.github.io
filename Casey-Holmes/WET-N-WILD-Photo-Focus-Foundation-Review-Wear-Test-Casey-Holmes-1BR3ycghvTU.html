today I'm going to be doing another
review and wear test on the new wet and
wild photo focus foundation I have been
using this quite a bit for the last
couple weeks and I figured I would share
with you guys and let you see how it
wears throughout the day you guys seem
to really enjoy my L'Oreal one that I
did so I definitely wanted to do on this
foundation as well let you know my
thoughts because if you don't watch me
on my snapchat and everything like that
you know I've had mixed reviews and I'm
going to give you my final review today
I have 20 minutes to us be out the door
so I'm going to hurry I'm a talkative
ass person so hopefully I can get
through this today I have a meeting I
have to work out as well unfortunately I
have to work out makeup on today this is
the only data I could so in this video
so we're going to see how holds up when
I work out and my workouts have been
super intense lately so we're going to
see just will run down on this
foundation it is $5.99 I did purchase
mine from Walgreens but you can get it
on the site as well 20 shades and it's
$5.99 a piece this has 4 stars on their
site it has only nine reviews let me
read the inscription real quick it says
your skin only better our new
high-performing skin perfecting
foundation underwent major road testing
under 7 different photo lighting
conditions to deliver flawless
camera-ready makeup every time does
unless you know I do have oily skin now
I have tried to foundation with the
Milani prime shield and I am NOT a fan
of this trend not at all it's too
slippery it's too like silicone and just
it did not work it's split all over the
place it wouldn't even like sit on my
skin right it would just move around
everywhere it was a hot mess I have
found that I love it with my normal
primers that I've been using recently
which is the Smashbox primer water and
the Canaan Austin and mattifying primer
you have a primer combo that you love I
recommend using that so hopefully I have
a color to match me today I have three
shades but I can only find two right now
so welcome to my life I have cream beige
which is medium and desert beige which
is medium dark I did self pan so I think
I'm going to go with this one because
I'm definitely a medium dark right now
so when it was leave crime also if you
guys follow me on snapchat you saw that
I got the drunk elephant in care as a PR
I've been using it recently you guys are
like oh my god you're going to expect
that you're going to love it whenever
you guys are sending me those messages
I did not hear one bad thing about it
and I totally agree I'm obsessed with
that skincare I feel like it has changed
my skin might be one day favorite
skincare I actually ordered some more
you know I love it if I got it as a PR
and then I went out right away and
purchased it just so I would not be
without it I'm gonna update you guys in
my thing rain hits and misses but so far
so good I'm loving it you're wondering
why self-tanner i use i do use lemon pan
it's my favorite just i mean this is
literally before and after I do not self
tan my face because I have really
sensitive skin and it's just that it
never works and it works for me this is
the bottle right here it is one fluid
ounce and it is a glass bottle it also
comes with a spatula on the end which at
first I did not think I was not like the
spatula but now I really like it
I think it's so much easier to just put
on your face like this then it is to put
it on the back of your hand clean your
hand off all that other kind of stuff
I'm going to use there's a L'Oreal
sponge that I love check that video is
last one up to the little card right
here if you didn't check it out I do
five minutes is a buildable foundation
like if I feel like I need a little more
coverage around my nose cheek area I can
totally go back in and put more on and
it's not going to look cakey now when I
first I think was like either the first
or second time the first time I used it
I use it on a Facebook live which if you
haven't seen that I will link it down
below you can check out my facebook
there I liked it in that Facebook live
but I noticed it didn't wear too well
throughout the day I don't know if it's
because my skin care has changed and my
skin else feels a little bit more
balanced I feel like this is holding up
a lot better now I don't know why but I
just feel like it is and then our second
time I used it I used it with an urban
decay primer and I was just trying out
the urban decay primer and literally you
guys that night I had little breakouts
all over my face and I was like oh hell
though basically before I keep telling
me the story I'm going to use my Tarte
shape paste and better skin concealer to
conceal under my eyes you can see right
here how it was on the skin does not
like a dewy finish but once you set it
it looks nice and matte and what you
just think this to the skin looks a
little bit better but it gave me full
coverage I know I'm looking crazy
because it's super dark this okay we got
this somebody sent me a tweet saying
that one of the urban decay primers is
getting people or just reaction
and I believe they pulled it off the
shelf at Sephora I believe this is what
the Instagram post said it was like oh
my god that makes sense like if people
are breaking out because of it I could
be breaking out because of it
ever since I quit using that primer but
I used a different one that day I think
it was like a complexion primer or
something like that and it didn't work
so I put the D flake on top of it and it
was just the hot DMS it wasn't be just
slick one I can't say that name it
wasn't the disc one it was the other one
and I had tried that broke me out and I
was giving other people reactions so I
was like okay I'm going to give the wet
wild one another tries and see if it
looks better you know what I mean and oh
my gosh you guys I don't know what it is
but I have been loving it lately
just loving it now I did try it with
that Milani primer and I hated it just
because I did not like the primer that
kind of primer in the way it feels is
not my favorite to wear because usually
they don't sit well on my skin I've been
loving it with my regular primers lately
hadn't been using the Tarte shape tape
just because I'm almost out of it I'm
using it today because I work more than
full coverage for this use it with the
Maybelline butter skin concealer like I
do in my last video if you want to check
that out I'll link it down below and
I've just been obsessed with it I think
it is so good the very first time I
tried it I believe I use the photo focus
concealer and I think that's what threw
me off like I think that's why I got soy
Li in my cheeks and stuff that obviously
bring my concealer down like in a
triangle and I did not like it I feel
like the concealer was a little like
greasy and just sat really weird on my
skin it just looked cakey and gross I
mean honestly so I wouldn't recommend
the concealer but I do really love this
foundation that's it looks like
everything just blends beautifully on
top I mean you could use this sponge to
blend it out and you'll be good I really
like it it doesn't accentuate pores
right now I'm starting with a little bit
more matte because we do have that
concealer on so I'm going to do is to
dress my face I'll come back to show you
guys a little update and what it looks
like with the rest of my products on and
then I will update you guys throughout
the day so I'll be back in just a second
okay guys so I finished my makeup this
is what it looks like with everything on
top
doing another kind of simple glam today
it is currently 1008 so I need to head
out the door
I will see you guys in a few hours and
give you a little update on this
foundation but so far so good I always
like the way that it looks after I put
all my powders and stuff on okay guys so
it is currently 243 I just got back from
the meeting and everything so this is
what the foundation is looking like it
definitely has like a little glow to it
but it's not something normally I
wouldn't say dogs normally I would say I
don't like it but this is the kind of
glow that like I mean it's a little bit
Whaley but it doesn't look terrible in
my opinion I feel like it looks okay
it's not like overly oily why looks
gross I feel like my skin pretty much
still looks pretty good with the
highlight and everything of course
almost too crazy or anything like that
so it's still going strong out and
blotted or put powder on which I'll
probably blunt after this but I don't
think I'll put more powder all I'm going
to go to the gym workout or just see how
it holds up during workout
um but yeah it's holding up well so far
in my opinion I like the way it wears
throughout the day if you have already
skin if I'm going to say can put remap
the entire time but it doesn't look bad
in my opinion so still going strong
Beauty usable do don't wrestle and is
downstairs charging but it's around 7:30
7:40 and I figured I would do my final
update for you so I could get this video
up tonight and I'm really really one to
take this makeup off to be quite honest
videos until this is what my skin looks
like I did blot one spot in my face
after these first updates and when I was
by my backdoor filming downstairs I did
go to the gym after that I was sweating
a bit fiddling so I want you guys to see
my highlight my contour my mic on door
contour my blush is still on it didn't
really kick up around my nose like that
L'Oreal foundation did it just looks a
lot better for a long period of time so
I'm going to go in I'm going to take
this blotting sheet and we're just going
to see if we can look a little bit
better
oh yeah look at that see the difference
I mean it just kind of confirms it for
me I do really like it you can see the
difference now this side looks more
Matt's
you can't really tell my pores are as
visible because that oil is soaked up so
look at the difference I mean hello
amazing what an easy fix for this
foundation so I really like the
foundation I give it a two thumbs up I
think it's great I think it's great for
the skin the job
when wild I'm pumped about this the
consumers are so much but this is damn
good for $5.99 and it does not break me
out like that only the goo primer did so
I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for watching and let me know
down below in the comments what you want
me to wear test for you next and I will
see you guys in my next video we are
closing in on Evan and I know we'll be
alright be alright
Bri yeah all right we are closer now
than ever and I'll be alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
