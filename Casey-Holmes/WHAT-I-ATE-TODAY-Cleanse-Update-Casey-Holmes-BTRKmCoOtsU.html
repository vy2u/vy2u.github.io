didn't think I was good for one of these
did you Oh today I'm filming a what I
ate today video and I'm gonna do a quick
disclaimer and I just want to say this
is literally what I ate in a day it's
not what I eat every single day I switch
it up I add more food I do whatever I
feel is best for me and how I feel so if
you don't like these videos and you
don't like the fact that it's not
completely vegan you might not want to
watch this video because you're probably
not gonna like it it's probably not
going to be your cup of tea or something
that you would want to watch I feel like
in my last video I just got roasted
roasted but it's what works for me and
if you don't like it I'm sorry but I
just I mean this is how I eat is how I
notice result and I also want to quickly
say that I am NOT pushing pills or the
AdvoCare stuff down anyone's throat it's
literally a cleanse I was trying
I'm still on AdvoCare I'm really
enjoying it up and getting tweets and
messages just wondering how I'm liking
it and everything like that so I'm gonna
let you guys know it's literally just
stuff I'm trying I'm not saying you have
to have AB hair lose weight and I'm not
saying you have to eat what I eat this
is just what I've been doing and I
really enjoyed making this video last
time even though it got a overwhelming
of who knows how to responses so anyways
I'm just gonna show you guys what I eat
today I don't know what I'm gonna have
for like dinner or lunch and everything
like that I pretty much have the same
breakfast every day because I don't like
to feel overly full especially before I
work out I do not like to have like a
really full stomach I just like to feel
satisfied and from what I've been eating
that's been doing that for me today is
like day so I'm gonna have like turkey
bacon and then I'm also going to take 3
catalysts so again I'm not telling you
to take these I'll kind of tell you my
results of the cleanse later in the
video because this is a long-ass intro
so let's eat some food and let's go
look at how my stomach looks now but
this is what I'm looking like so far my
waist is in a little bit more and I
don't know if you can see if I'm getting
more definition here in my stomach the
cleanse what it did is it really helped
my bloating and I'm just not as bloated
anymore and I've been seeing a lot of
results with this like looking like my
waist is going in more this is like the
area that I gained weight right away is
in my waist but yeah I'm just I'm
starting to tone up more this area you
can kind of see in this lighting it's
hard to see a little bit it's only been
like a week week and a half to two weeks
so it's not like you see abs in like two
weeks that's just not how it works
but I have noticed a difference in my
body and I feel so much better when I
first started this cleanse I was really
bloated
I was also bloated throughout the
cleanse too just because there was so
much fiber and I was just going to the
bathroom laughs getting all that stuff
out but now I feel so much better I'll
also throw in some video where you guys
can see how toned my arms have gotten
and it's like a huge huge improvement
I've posted them on Twitter so if you
kind of wanna see that kind of stuff let
me know and I'll keep doing it for you
um but I'm really excited with how I'm
looking so far and I feel like as long
as I keep it up I'll just be looking
even better
okay so I just got done or hang out now
I'm away to go get a smoothie this was a
good leg day I felt so strong what's
gonna take my camera in there and I said
not to because I shouldn't feel like it
but I did now well we did a couple
videos on my phone so yeah we're just
taking more and more videos as time goes
on I wish we did it right in the very
beginning of us training together but
you know that's okay we'll see some
really good results with these videos so
let's go get that smooth air alright
guys so as always I like to have a
smoothie at the end of my workouts just
to get that protein in and I do it right
after I work out and make the games
people so this is strawberry banana
again iso100 protein you get a smoothie
every time I work out after every
workout so I get my protein really works
for me I don't like to eat like a full
blown meal like chicken and things like
that just know what it is just too heavy
for my stomach so this is the perfect
way to get
and it is so good so now we're gonna go
home and I'm probably that salad I'm
having lunch and my mom at like 3:00
3:30 so I'll show you guys what I get
when I go out to eat too usually unless
it's like my cheat day it's very rare I
don't really go out to eat much like at
restaurants but I'll show you guys what
I get ok so as most of you see I did go
out to lunch without telling with my mom
and it was kind of like a late lunch
early dinner so I actually ate a salmon
and what I did was when we first got
there I just got a water with lemon and
then the bread came out and I did have
two pieces of bread that was like my
little cheat I guess I had a little bit
of it because longhorns bread is so good
I had a couple slices of those and then
my meal was a salmon no seasoning with
broccoli and then it also had a salad
with light ranch and the salad had a lot
of dressing on it so I did not eat the
full thing I
and I was done with it the salmon was
pretty good and so was the broccoli the
broccoli light wasn't too hard I was
like that perfect not hard not soft
texture you know what I'm talking about
if you like broccoli it was cooked
perfectly I had that at around 3
something for I would say about 4
o'clock
4:15 it's 743 now I'm not starving but I
wouldn't mind having something light so
I'm going to show you guys this little
salad salad I'm going to try out and I'm
really excited about it I'm hoping it's
to express some of my favorite things in
it so first thing you'll need this
recipe that I got from online has like a
lot but I'm just going to mix one
serving for me so I'm going to take one
avocado half of a cucumber a little bit
of and
red onion one of these adorable Tomatoes
lemon olive oil it says a little bit of
salt I'm just going to add just tiny
pinch this is the salt that I've been
using lately it's the number six 100%
natural sea salt and it says Himalayan
sea salt organic I don't know a company
sent this or my management team actually
sent this to me and for Christmas it's
like a gift and it's good you don't need
a lot of this at all and then I'm going
to take some pepper because I do love
pepper and we're gonna put it all in a
bowl drizzle it with a little extra
virgin olive oil this one's ours like
the organic kind from Newman's Own organ
and yeah let's hope it's good
it's got like a column in it so it's
probably good
okay so since I did less ingredients
than the recipe asked for I did like not
a full tablespoon the forest of people
calls for two tablespoons of
extra-virgin olive oil all I didn't like
half of a tablespoon because I just
didn't want a lot of oil in here just
because I'm not a big fan of oil so this
smells so good I'm so excited and it
looks so pretty I'm hoping please Lord
let this be good I did put a half a
lemon you're supposed to put like a
whole lemon in it doesn't that look
gorgeous
all right guys moment of truth this is
that stuff that you see on Facebook this
is one of those recipes okay that looks
really good I'm nervous metal I have fun
I like it I'm not a big onion person
like raw onions so next time I'll
probably leave out there all onions but
like the lemon the oil Wow it's really
good and the cucumber I love cucumbers
so I'm going to eat this have a glass of
water and then that might be yet I don't
know maybe I forget hungry later I'll
have something but I'm not really
feeling too hungry and I'll probably
save most of this for tomorrow
I'm going to go ahead and wrap up this
what I ate today video and I didn't eat
a ton I feel like that late lunch kind
of like did me in and that smoothie and
my breakfast I mean I just had really
filling things today and that light
salad was like exactly what I needed but
lately I've been making this
sleepytime tea I don't know if it's like
makes a difference with anything I don't
know if it makes me sleep more I just
love the warm feeling that it like gives
me I've had a ton of water today I just
drink so much water um I want to quickly
say a couple different points and I want
to just really quickly wrap this up the
first thing is I don't want you guys to
call this a diet that I'm on I've
actually I should've explained this in
the beginning of my last video about
what I ate today I eat pretty well I
just have a problem or I had a problem
with being lazy and going and eating
fast food right away because I don't
want to cook or I just I went on
vacation I had just gotten back from
seeing my boyfriend not long for and you
know we ate like crap and we drink beer
you know and I just didn't really keep
myself on track and I did not stay
strict with myself I guess you could say
so
I mean avocado on toast and salads and
and chicken and veggies like that's I
ate that kind of stuff for a while I
just didn't eat it as often as I should
I had cheat meals more often and then I
had healthy meals so that's not good and
I did not drink as much water as I do
now so with me actually eating how I'm
supposed to eat just watching things and
just asking for like no seasoning or
whatever and from giving up Diet Coke to
working out this AdvoCare stuff that has
helped me I am so happy with the results
and I can't wait to see what happens
later on down the line spring break is
next week you guys I say
the pina coladas are what's gonna do me
in but I might be okay but it is a
vacation I'm not going to deprive myself
of something that I want but I also
don't want to go crazy or someone I
workout I want to take you know what I'm
taking and everything like that but that
pretty much sums up this whole day I
really hope you guys enjoyed it
I will leave like what I ate down below
the description box as well for you guys
thank you guys so much for watching and
I hope you guys have a great day bye
using the most are peach daiquiri
Bellini and hotty totty I've hotty totty
