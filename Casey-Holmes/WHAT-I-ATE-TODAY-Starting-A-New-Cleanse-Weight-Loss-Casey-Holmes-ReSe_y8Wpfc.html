and today I'm actually starting
something new I'm actually starting a
ten day cleanse I'm actually trying with
AdvoCare my best friend Allison does
AdvoCare and she swears by it so I
figured I would try it out the spring
breaks coming up and the moment needs to
lose some pounds so if you follow me on
snapchat you've already seen like us
trying to get this stuff together I
figured I would do it why I eat in a day
video vlogging kind of style a lot of
you requested that and I figured I would
just go ahead and do that for you guys
um most of the stuff that I eat I've
already ate beforehand and like this is
what I've been eating you know before I
started this so nothing really eating
wise is going to change I'm just gonna
really keep track and make sure it's
really clean and that you know I don't
cheat as much as I have so eating what I
have been what I'm going to show you
guys is what has helped me lose some
weight
luckily my best friend does milk prep
she does a meal prepping business which
is I'm going to go ahead and show you
guys what I'm going to quickly take
right now is 10:43 on if I said that but
to start off my morning I'm going to
have a fiber drink so this cleanse is
basically like just trying to get
everything out of your system so I'm
going to take this it doesn't taste too
bad we actually taste it last night just
not too bad I'm just going to take my am
side of this that has a small fill I'm
going to be taking my thermo and
catalyst as well and then I also have
spark I'm going to kind of try spark
they gave three different flavors so I'm
going to try this one today the mango
strawberry I don't know if I like my god
never tried mango the more mostly I like
it so yeah I'm going to quickly take
those I'm gonna make some breakfast and
then yeah we're just going to get a move
on with this day I have to go and leave
for the gym in about 11:30 and I workout
for like an hour hour and a half but now
it's gonna be long because I'm going to
do extra cardio to get me prepared for
these next few weeks I need to weigh
myself I need to measure myself today
it's gonna be a fun day because I know
I've gained some weight these past
couple weeks so
ok so I have my two eggs here you guys
saw piece of toast I like to use this
nature's own wheat 40 calorie per slice
bread I just like it I think it's nice
and I need some kind of carb in the
morning and then on top of that I did
use my green wise organic grape jelly I
love this stuff I have to have something
on my toast I just got down my workout
I'm hot sweaty it was a really good
workout we did legs we're combining legs
right now doing hamstrings and quads in
the same day just still kind of catch me
up get me prepared for the beach in
three weeks so a really good leg day I
feel like I'm gonna be sore tomorrow I
did a little bit of ABS not a lot I'm
going to try to do more tomorrow and
then I did some cardio I didn't like 25
minutes of a fast paced walk but now I'm
going straight to my smoothie place
which is right down the road and I'm
going to get a smoothie so I got my
smoothie
I have strawberry banana and I also have
I still 100 which is the protein that I
have in here they were actually out of
synthos so I figured I would try this
one and I asked my friend what the
difference was and she said it's lower
sugar and lower carb than the scent that
I usually get and doesn't taste bad
this might be what I get from now on
just because it is lower carbon sugar
cuz
mama don't need a more carbs or sugar
honey I'm trying shuttin off so much
that's really good I tried to drink that
as fast as possible not like Speedy
Gonzales but I tried I drink it really
quick and just get it into my system
right now since it is a post-workout
we're gonna do my measurements tomorrow
but today I weighed 141 which was a
surprise to me because I thought I was
gonna weigh more than that I'm gonna see
like my body fat and everything like
that in I might update that in the
description box cuz I don't know when
you guys are going to see this so I'll
get in the description box what my
measurements are right now so then you
can follow along and see like my results
and you know my inches and stuff as I
put these videos up so let me know how
you want to see these videos if you want
to see them once a week you know if you
have any ideas for it you know just
leave it in the comments below and of
course if you like these kind of videos
don't forget to give them a thumbs up
I'm not the type to weigh things I just
kind of eat healthy and eat what I like
and just eat till in full and then I'm
done I won't like overeat so unless it's
like a chocolate cake then I'm overeat
okay so now it is a 4:20 for love you
can see that for I'm actually really
hungry I want more than a snack so I'm
going to heat up this precooked meal
this one has green beans some rice and
the chicken breast
she doesn't solve any of these and I'm
gonna eat some of these like some of
this rice I'm not gonna eat all of it
and I'm going to have some chicken so
and then with my chicken I am gonna have
a little bit of hot sauce just to add
some different flavors I find that when
I add this hot sauce and stuff now it
really helps me stay on track and it
kind of doesn't taste like I'm eating
the same thing every single day you know
what I'm saying and I'm also gonna drink
some water I'm gonna work on this I've
had 36 ounces of water so far right away
let me add this up before us
if my sofa I don't think it's 36 ounces
I've had 32 ounces of water so far I've
had four full water bottles play another
toy
yeah I've had 32 ounces water so far and
I'm going to work on this and I'm also
going to go ahead and take another spark
because feeling a little bit tired like
I need to pick me up so instead of like
coffee or anything watches I know I need
to momma floors I just slept but anyways
she's distracting she's so funny but I'm
gonna go ahead and get another spark I'm
so excited to eat this thank God my
friend does the milk rat stuff now she's
got a roach she's like look mom not
gonna have some of your food because I
brought door opening Joe by the way I do
want to quickly say one thing I know I'm
selling this shirt it's gross to be in
this shirt after the gym but I've been
working around the house and I just
haven't had a chance to change but after
I eat I promise I'll change and I want
to quickly stay a little thing real
quick I'm thinking of it now that I just
put the spark in here though I want to
say I tried spark today before my
workout and usually I have a pre-workout
called neon if you guys have ever tried
neon it is very intense it's just it's a
crazy intense pre-workout it'll make you
feel really itchy and it really gives
you energy
I was nervous going from neon to spark
cause I was like what if it doesn't like
give me energy because I've tried c4 as
well as c4 is nothing compared to neon
this gave me a ton of energy at the gym
I was drinking it on my way so I got to
the gym I was like ready to go was
pumped up and I didn't feel itchy or
anything like that so if you're having
issues with your pre-workout getting you
itchy and you sput you still want that
energy I would definitely try a spark I
like it so far this is one of those
things where you're going to know right
away if you like a pot like within that
day and I definitely like it and
definitely the fruit punch so far my
favorite but I just want to put that in
there if you have been working out and
you've been using a pre-workout though a
part of all this stuff I also want to
show you guys my body is so okay how it
changes throughout this whole process
don't mind my hair I just let it down
now it's a little embarrassing for me I
know it's kind of sad but you know I'm
just not where I'm at this is why I'm
doing this um it's not like I'm I think
I'm fat I just need to really tone up
and just watch what I eat so I'm going
to show you guys my body and we're going
to see after a few weeks
how looking hopefully it's good oh my
god I hate this I've had this little
cord is really annoying I'm sorry so
this is what I'm looking like right now
the shadow is kind of making it look
weird anyways this is how I'm looking
right now I need to really just tone up
I just have like a lot of fat in here
I want to tone up my arms of course
always hit the but I also want to get
rid of this area and just really work on
the midsection I was doing really good
for a little bit there I was um pretty
cut but you know vacations happen and
life happens I have to build muscle in
my legs I you know if they just don't
gain weight unless I work out do squats
so my legs are good my butt kind of went
down so I definitely want to work on my
butt more so within the next couple
weeks in the next week I will show you
guys what my body looks like and let you
know what I think is improving I'm also
going to take pictures because everybody
needs pictures to see where they come
from don't really bloated right now I
feel like I have so much fiber in my
stomach and I just I'm just bloated and
I feel really gross right now so I'm
ready to bust ass these next three weeks
and if you are on a like weight loss
toning just being healthy journey let me
know down below let me know your goals
and what you're doing and your weight
and things and how it's even going if

such a weird combo but this is what I'm
going to have for a snack to kind of
hold me over till dinner

just have half an avocado with some
pepper some carrots into rice cake so
this should hold me off till dinner I'm
like starving for some reason right now
so I don't know if I'll you all these
carrots but we shall see do you think
Lily jiying all the game words okay so
some reason I am so freaking hungry
right now so I'm going to have it's
about 7:30 by the way I went for my
meals to be done like being milk prepped
so I could beat that for dinner but I'm
going to go ahead and eat this it's the
heart to heart cause she instant oatmeal
and the golden maple flavor hopefully
this is good I'm not really a oatmeal
kind of person hopefully I like this
brand I've never tried it before okay
guys this is my last meal for the night
chicken broccoli a little bit of rice
again I'm going to have some hot sauce
with it and I'm halfway on my gallon
which is good I'll be done with this
definitely before I go to bed so that's
awesome I've had 32 ounces Plus this
gallon so I feel like that's a good bit
for my first day so that is going to be
it for this video I hope you guys
