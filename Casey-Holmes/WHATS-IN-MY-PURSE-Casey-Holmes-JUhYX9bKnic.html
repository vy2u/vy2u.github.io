a really highly requested video and ever
since I got this purse I have been
having so many people tell me I need to
do and what's in my purse video and the
last time I did one of these I think was
like three years ago it's been a minute
so I got this purse and I showed it on
Instagram when I got it it was
definitely a huge splurge the bigger
splurge I've ever had on a designer bag
but I have not done this since about a
year ago when I purchased my first
Louboutin that was my first like
designer handbag ever I've had my eye on
this bag for a good minute now and it's
just a classic bag that like doesn't go
out of style and I love it I love the
fact that it's black because the
Louboutin want to have is brown so now I
have a black in a brown bag because
instead we've been going on and I felt
like I deserved this bag and it's my 3
year anniversary on YouTube and 800,000
subscribers later I was like okay I mean
it's time to purchase one so for all of
you wondering what it is it is this
Prada bag I don't know like the exact
name or anything like that I got super
lucky when I went into the store to get
this because they actually had it I went
in once before and they didn't have the
black with gold hardware and then I went
in over the weekend and I still didn't
have any more of these like they're just
selling out like crazy so I got really
lucky when I purchased mine and I don't
know was what don't get it wet but mine
is not the smooth leather it's the one
that's like embossed or whatever because
I I'm pretty rough on my bag so I know
if I got the soft leather I would
scratch it so I just went with this one
has two zippers and then the inside I
was really nervous to get this bag
because of the inside because usually I
like things that close all the way I'm
like super like a freak about that I had
to have my purses closed completely but
since this had two separate compartments
that closed I figured I could just throw
the junk in the middle and then have the
important stuff in these zippers and
then what also sold me on this bag was
the strap I will not purchase a high-end
bag if it does not have a strap to go
with it because I don't I just don't see
the point and I like the handles too
because they're a little bit longer than
the
one that was on my Louboutin speedy like
you sometimes whenever I would have my
six plus it was hard to put my hand and
my six plus through the handles if I
don't have a problem with this one I
know that sounds like first world
problems but I feel like if you spend
that much money on a bag it should not
be an inconvenience to you so I love
this
I don't really know um too much about
Prada bags I just I saw this one and I
was like yes I've always loved product I
just think they have beautiful bags
there's actually another one that I want
so bad but that would definitely be like
later down the line this one is my baby
and I'm so happy with it so with this
bag it does have buttons on the side you
can just undo it like this and make it
bigger so it's kind of easier to access
as well so um yeah let's just do this
pocket first though cuz there's only one
thing in this one I just keep my wallet
in here and when I purchased this bag it
also did get a matching wallet because I
knew if I stuck with my Louboutin wallet
I would be like oh like I can't I have
to have things that match I guess you
can say so I figured if I was flirting
on this I should just splurge on wallet
I got this one and I love it because it
unfolds let me cover all this stuff up
it unfolds all the way and I love that
so that's what it looks like and then it
also has a bunch of stuff in here as
well so yeah I love this wallet I wanted
a Louis Vuitton wallet like this when I
first bought my other one but I did end
up getting it so I was like okay I'm
gonna get what I want this time so I got
what I want
this is like where I keep all my my
checks in here I forgot I had checks and
here I'll go have some dollar bills and
receipt the Publix because I'm always at
Publix I feel like and then I have a
bunch of change because I just end up
throwing cash and stuff in here when I'm
out without cuz I don't like stop and
pet my wallet you wanna me so yeah
that's all it's in there and it's a
really pretty lining in there too you
probably can't see it but pretty pretty
pretty lining
there's also a zipper right here I don't
think I have anything
no I just have the cards for the Prada
bag and then in this little pocket right
here I have a Saks Fifth Avenue card a
guy that was helping at Saks 5th gave me
his card and then I also have my Gucci
Guilty little travel perfume I lost the
top which I'm kind of sad about but I
love Gucci Guilty and I only buy the
little mini things like this if they
have a spray if they're a rollerball I
invited them because it's just wasting
my time and then I have more change of
course I do more change change all the
time I have a change jar so I always
just put in my change jar okay so let's
go here in the middle and see what we've
got
so the first thing is this little guy
it's a makeup bag from forever 21 and
has a lipstick and then a mascara I
usually keep tampons and stuff in here
but currently out of tampons so I need
to fill that up I also have this Oh
Phipps Plaza Mall directory because I
went there for the first time over the
weekend and I needed to know where to go
and I got so lost I think I was
overthinking everything but I got so
lost but I had a directory so I'm gonna
keep this let's see I also have a Mophie
case for my 6 plus I found this actually
on HauteLook they had them on sale at
one point I was so happy because it's
been so hard to find a Mophie case for
the 6 plus and this is perfect so I keep
that with me because my phone is usually
always dying oh I have why are these on
in their case so I have these product
sunglasses my favorite brand for
sunglasses is Prada I have one pair that
I've purchased four pairs of I just
repurchased them over and over because
I've lost them or something like that
it's been like a couple years but it's
my favorite style I'll show you here a
minute but these are a newer pair that I
got not too long ago and I love them
because they're more square and I don't
usually like square sunglasses but these
I can work with I like them so I just
got these because they were different
and then I have the case that it goes in
why they're done in there I don't know
let's hope I can find the other burglar
in here um I also have some benadryl
because it's a long story but it helps
me with my anxiety so I always keep in a
drill on me Oh with us right I have a
bunch of random stuff in here I have
some always clean wipes look good you
guys today fresh okay got a fresh um and
then I have a receipt oh this is my
receipt for rose when I went and picked
up rose why is it still in here this is
like all of her information going to the
vet and stuff like that and then I have
a receipt for what is this oh my dentist
so this is a receipt for my dentist I
was like what in the world I don't know
who these people are another state won't
have mercy from the vet that I took rose
to and then I just have some mail
because I tend to go to my mailbox a lot
and then I'll just like throw it in my
purse and not check it for about a week
it's a really bad habit it'll usually be
like okay I'll check it out remember to
look at my mail and then it's like a
week goes by and I'm like oh have
bills I have to check my mail so I'm
really bad about that and then I have oh
this is a PIN number for my card that
didn't work so it was completely waste
of time I have a receipt for Bose

two but Moses closer to me so that's
where I usually go if I want a burrito

where this was I've been looking for
this everywhere this is a road on the

flirty and then I also have the Daisy
Marc Jacobs perfume as well this is the
spray one too so I just have like an
option of different scents you know
whatever I'm feeling for the day and
then we're gonna move on to the first
pocket right here which I believe is
full of makeup yes so I have a Sephora
brush in here because especially if I'm
wearing extensions like I am today you
got a brush out your hair you know my
hair even just having long hair without
extensions my hair gets super tangley so
I need this brush in my life and I don't
know how I got this one I think it was
like a gift from Sephora like that and
oh I got this really cool brush from
Sonia Kashuk it's like a little compact
it's so sanitary like I love it it's a
little compact you open it up and then a
brush comes out and you can just like
brush your powder on and then close it
right back up I love this this is so
awesome and then

backup and then the last thing in my
purse is this Mac prep and prime just
