be sharing with you some new drugstore
products that I purchased from Ulta and
I've been doing a lot of makeup shopping
recently because I just got back from
being out of town for so long and I'm
kind of just like catching up on all the
new releases and getting all of the
holiday stuff that I really want to like
snag up and review for you guys I do
have some things in this hall from
honest hacia but for the most part
everything is drugstore and is brand new
and you do have a really cool brush set
that I bought for myself to try because
it just looked too good that's what this
video is gonna be on if you aren't
subscribed already be sure to subscribe
and if you want to see all the new
drugstore goodies and some armed
associate that I purchased then let's
just go ahead and get started I'll start
off with drugstore stuff first and then
I'll move on to anastacio labs so this
is one of the items that I am wearing
right now and I really like it it is the
NYX 3 steps to sculpt contour palette
got the shade light pale this is a
pretty dark contour so these shades
right here are pretty pigmented with
this contour shade I used them more feet
and 5:23 tapped it in there tapped off
the excess and then put it on my face it
is super pigmented so just go in with a
light hand this was so nice this is like
more of a yellow tone powder used to set
your concealer I used it to carve out my
contour and it really gave like a nice
sleek finish like don't mind these
little hairs right here I'm not wearing
this highlighter right now but it does
look really pretty this is definitely my
kind of tone like a nice golden sheen to
the skin so this is what that looks like
it is very very pretty I love that my
hands are a little bit more fair than my
face and body because I wash my hands
all the time and they cannot stay tan so
don't mind that you can really see where
it's like fading so far so good with
this product next thing that I have is
the products from the Maybelline Gigi
Hadid collection I did purchase these
myself because I did not get them in PR
first thing that we have is this is a
little dirty but it's the Gigi Hadid
warm palette looks very very similar to
all the other Maybelline pellets and the
Maybelline Shayla palette which I love
the Maybelline Shayla collab I thought
it was amazing but this is really pretty
it's kind of just like your basic shades
nothing too
I will say purchasing these I was like
oh my god why are you so expensive
there's a pallet in here that's like $30
and I was like why is this so expensive
and I guess it's just because of the
collab with Gigi so it'd just be warned
it is pretty pricey I have not tried
these out yet if you guys want me to do
like a full video testing out the Gigi
collection definitely let me know I feel
like there's a lot of reviews out there
I personally haven't watched all of that
I'm still kind of like I would know how
I feel about most of this stuff but let
me know if you guys want to see a video
reviewing this collection at least all
this stuff that I purchased so I did try
out a few of these items and I know I
don't like this product this is the Gigi
Hadid fiber mascara so on one side you
do have the fibers they are like little
white fibers and on the other side you
have the mascara so you apply the
mascara and then apply the fibers and
then apply mascara back over top and I
didn't like this because I felt like it
weighed in my lashes down my lash just
went a little bit more droopy than they
usually are and the fibers were not
covered up by the mascara really well I
tried so hard to get all those little
stupid fibers covered and I just
couldn't get them covered that's another
reason I really don't use fibre mascaras
is because sometimes you can really see
it unless it's like black fibers and
that's a little bit better but I wasn't
a big fan of this I don't think it
worked really well for my lashes it made
my lashes look a little bit gray since
the fibers are white and I just couldn't
get them all covered up the mascara I
have on right now it has still been my
favorite it's this one right here from
essence is the volume stylist
eighteen-hour lash extension mascara
this is so good it makes you look like
you're wearing false lashes and you're
not
it doesn't weigh your lashes down and
it's just it's really really good so I'm
still hooked on this one for drugstore
mascaras there hasn't been anything that
could beat it because this is like false
lashes in a tube it's amazing to get
this little set it was a lot prettier
when it came in the mail but I did try
this out like these colors a lot this is
more of like a fiery red so it's the
West Coast glow lip kit and you get a
lip liner and a lipstick I really like
these I think Maybelline has really
great formulas when it comes to a lip
liner and lipstick so again this is just
like a fiery red color if you have
something similar to this I mean I would
recommend not buying it because it's
nothing too different that's what it
looks like right there I feel like it's
the same formula just different
packaging I do like that they included a
lip liner with it if you don't have a
lip liner to match a lip color like this
perfectly it is
this kit for you and I think the
packaging is super pretty I mainly
purchase this just to try out for you
guys and see how we liked it so this
isn't like a liquid lip it's not matte
or anything so I don't wear this when
I'm out and about to be honest with you
because here a drum it is so windy and
my hair will just fly in my face and all
have like red streaks all over my face
if you guys want me to do like a full
wear test on this I can include that
with the review of all these products if
you're interested but this is a really
pretty color very smooth very creamy and
it looks really gorgeous but it's
nothing like too different this other
lipstick that I purchased from the
collection I have not swatched or
anything it looks really really
beautiful this is in the shade McCall
again it just kind of like matches the
packaging it just looks so so pretty oh
and this is really pretty I love the
color of that I think that it's
absolutely stunning again I can't wait
to wear this I think I will wear this
more inside indoors then I will out and
about you know running errands and stuff
but I do like the color of this I think
it's really pretty and it's a great nude
drugstore option so I did purchase the
black liquid liner that again has that
same like matte nude packaging this is
what the liner looks like it looks
really really nice it's very sleek and
pretty and it is a really nice black
line so I'll try this out and let you
guys know how I like it
there's some new things out from Revlon
so the first thing that I have which I'm
actually trying out now you'll see the
video Wednesday
I've been trying this out and I did wear
test for you so just stay tuned but it
is the Revlon Photoready instant filter
foundation I got the shades 330 and 240
I will say these do oxidize so just keep
that in mind whenever you're purchasing
this and if you want to see a full
review I can't tell you too much now but
if you want to see a full view it'll be
up this Wednesday and I recommend
checking it out because there are
definitely some pros and there
definitely some cons with this
foundation
another thing that they came out with is
the sunlit dream highlight palette I
tried this out today actually I went
with something different but it's just
not as like intense and pretty as I
would like it's more of a subtle
highlight so if you like really subtle
highlights you might like this you have
a more white icy tone you have a golden
tone more pinky and then a more
bronze I like that they put a little bit
of everything in this palette it is
really pretty but just to me it's not
it's not super pigmented and I feel like
for the price it's just not necessarily
the best thing they're just not they're
not standout products you know what I
mean and Revlon is not cheap so this
will probably be going back and then I
will be dead honest I don't know why I
keep buying stuff like this but I just
get sucked in when it says new and I
just feel like I need to try it this is
the Revlon Photoready color correcting
pen for redness so it's the green pen
just looks like this and most of you
know I have a rosacea but I don't use
green products I never used stuff like
this the green is great to counteract
redness and again I have rosacea so it's
good to try stuff like this out I'm just
gonna test it out and see how well it
works if it doesn't work you know
whatever I don't use them anyways I
wanted to pick it up because it is new
from Revlon and I'm just interested to
see how it wears so there's the
packaging right there really sleek and
pretty it is a twist up pen I don't know
it might be good I'll test it out I
normally like I said don't use green of
products like this just because I feel
like it's another step in makeup and for
me when I wear foundations concealers I
go for like more full coverage product
so I don't necessarily always need
something like this but it's good to try
it out and then I could try like a
lightweight product on top I guess I'm
either a full glam or nothing at all so
I'll still try this out for you guys and
let you know what I think if it's bad I
must send it back and then we also have
this Revlon Colorstay brow mousse but
it's like in a pen form I find this very
interesting so I got the shade of blonde
which hit myself and face how I
should've got a darker shade because I
didn't want to go darker with my hair
there so it has 24 hour wear Revlon one
twist brow styler
so basically it says gently twist base
of pen to propelled formula into the
brow and to both sides of brush brush
mousse over both brows to tame tint and
act
this so to me I'm taking it that this is
more of like a brow gel type thing I
don't know about filling in the brows
whoa that's so weird
so that's what it looks like when it
comes out the tube I don't want to run
it through my brows right now but I mean
so I guess one side for one brow the
other side's for the other brow
I don't see you like a huge difference
but then again I did just fill in my
brows I use the makeup revolution brow
pomade if you're wondering I love it
I'll keep trying this out I'll try it
out without any brow product to to see
if it even fills in the brows I feel
like it's not going to but I'll test it
out we'll see see two more things from
my blonde we do have this eyeshadow base
it says it has shea butter in it I don't
know how well it's gonna work with oily
eyelids but we could test it out
basically it's just an eyeshadow primer
and it says it'll give you staying power
for all day vibrant color and crease
proof wear so definitely check that out
I'm always looking for a good drugstore
eyeshadow primer mind it's hard to get a
really good drugstore eyeshadow base
because I have oily eyelids and
sometimes they just make it worse the
Revlon kiss is fully adding balm
basically it's just a sugar scrub and it
hydrates your lips so I figured for the
winter time I can test this out to
finishing up a drugstore this is the
last thing I got from the gigi hadid
Maybelline collection first up this is
so mesmerizing
I hate this sleeve off and then this is
the palette again that just kind of goes
with the rest of the collection this is
a freaking expensive palette okay it is
very pretty I give them that you're
really big mirror and then you have some
Facebook oh this little dual ended brush
which I'll probably never use but you
have some eyeshadows concealers lip
product - some eyeshadows here and then
face products over here and then a
mascara and another face brush I'm not a
big fan of the size of these - like to
get my brush in there it's gonna be
rough that highlight shade no that looks
really good oh okay so here the
eyeshadow is just a really quick swatch
they look a little
chunky a little shear we'll have to see
maybe I'll do a video on these let's
finish up with some more drugstore stuff
I got this from makeup revolution at
makeup revolution is one of those brands
that kind of a makeup revolution is one
of those brands that kind of copies
other brands that way you can get that
type of product for a more affordable
price sometimes their stuff is like
identical to high-end products um people
hate it some people are like well not
everybody can afford high-end product so
this is the makeup revolution champagne
liquid highlighter so this was in the
shade liquid champagne very similar to
the coverfx ones um I think this is
pretty much the same size maybe even a
little bit bigger you get point six one
fluid ounces you have a little dropper
this looks really pretty
I didn't even drop it I just like dotted
it on my hand it's a very liquidy
consistency but look at that that is so
that is so pretty I mainly use liquid
highlighters like all over my body like
on my shoulders and on my legs I mix it
with my moisturizer sometimes I'm going
to an event it looks really good that
light was definitely the theme of this
haul and you'll see why in just a second
so we also have this makeup revolution
ultra pro glow to a highlighter palette
let me just tell you I opened up the box
for all these products and I saw this
smells like oh my god it looks so much
more beautiful in person so I am going
to swatch few of these somebodies look
like blush colors I would never use
those as highlight though the packaging
is really pretty it's just like a clear
plastic case spin it up oh I can't take
my hands in these so I will probably
gear more towards this first row but if
you do like more colorful highlights
shimmery blushes shimmery bronzer you
might like that as well see this is what
I'm talking about look at these look at
that that for deeper skin tones dude
these are super pretty I cannot wait to
see what these look like
on the skin dang so here the shades are
super pretty very reflective I cannot
wait to see how this looks on the skin
and there are a few more things and then
we'll get onto honest Asya so I do have
this NYX ultimate multi finish shadow
palette I've seen this for so long on
the website I just haven't been
well yet because I wanted to get more
stuff from ulta if I were going to make
a purchase you know what I mean I
finally picked this up because I've
heard really great things about it so I
picked those up because I heard really
great things about it this one is in the
shade hugger hi I don't know man it just
speaks to me it looks so pretty look at
these shades
I gotta get better adjectives these look
gorgeous I don't know I feel like they
are a little glittery so you might have
to use like a glitter glue or something
but I mean that is stunning so what you
have is you have the first row is mattes
this is more of a sheen and these are
more of like your glitter or more
intense eye shadows like that they have
a little bit of everything in here and
they also have really nice transition
shades highlight shades so I'm excited
to test this out I'll probably do like a
drugstore makeup tutorial very soon and
I might include this so just stay tuned
for that and then the last few products
that I have I did purchase two of these
a movie lon so I did purchase two of
these Milani blush is we have coral
beams which looks stunning
and then also bronze burst this is what
they look like I really like Milani
blushes I mean they've never failed me
when it comes to blush they just know
what they're doing
so there's coral beams it is more on the
sheer side it has more of like a glow to
it I think that's what they were going
forward and want kind of a subtle glow
with your blush but you don't like
shimmer you would have to probably build
these up but oh I love that color these
are the kind of colors right here in
this bronze burst that would go to for
summer so I can't wait to try this out
and then we also have the last drugstore
item which is the Ulta baked highlighter
it's a three piece wet/dry highlight
palette I've tried some things from Ulta
to makeup and I really liked it so I was
interested to test this out hey do you
see how reflective these are Wow so
again this is the ultimate baked
highlighter palette can't wait to test
this out I will definitely let you guys
know what I think then last things that
I got are from augusta's yeah I just got
three products from her I really just
wanted to hurry up and test this stuff
out so we have the on estancia prism
palette now I have kind of dabbled into
this I was nervous / excited to test
this out because of the soap culture
palette that was kind of like a mess for
almost everyone it was one of those
things where you either loved that
palette or
despite it I was one that did not love
that palette I thought it could have
been better
haven't really heard anyone talk about
this I haven't really seen it much
because wealthy palate looks like very
very pretty intense shades formula is
definitely different than the subculture
one this is way better it's not as much
fallout they're very pigmented as well
and I really like them here's some
swatches right there I mean so pretty I
love these shades I've been loving the
color combos anasazi has been coming out
with because it's different we'll say I
used lucid right here on my lid this is
definitely one of those chunky colors so
you're gonna wanna have like fix+ on
your brush you're gonna wanna have like
a glitter glue down because it does have
some fallout once you have this on your
lid it is stunning absolutely stunning
but the max in here blend beautifully
the rest of these shades are really nice
just use it with your finger and you'll
be fine normally I'm not a finger person
but I'm getting into it because I
realized some things you just have to
apply with your fingers it's just hard
with nails this blush palette is another
product that I got from honest Asya it's
the blush kit in radiant I have
coastline which is one of the shades in
here on my cheeks right now very
pigmented you need a light hand with
this product I love their packaging they
do such a great job with packaging and
just color combos so this is the one I
have on my cheeks right now it's great
goes with everything I just love these
colors I think they're so good I can't
get enough of it I've had this in my
cart so many times and I finally just
fit the bullet because I was like okay
you know you're gonna use it so just buy
it I'm super happy I bought this it does
have a little mirror I love the
packaging I'm taking this when I'm
traveling I think it's amazing so well
we do have another uh Nastasia glow kit
that i purchased this is the sugar one
and it has this like really gorgeous
purple ombré to it and you have four
different shades in here pretty much
like the rest of hers you have
marshmallow gumdrop butterscotch and
starburst I'm wearing starburst and a
little bit of marshmallow on my cheeks
now and it's such a reflective glow and
to me it's not accentuating pores or
anything I'm really impressed with this
one I like it a lot again I'm traveling
with this one so real quick I'm gonna
show you guys the tools that I purchased
that was all the makeup so then I did
purchase this sweet and shimmer blending
sponge it just looks like a little
Beauty Blender I just want to try it out
always down to see what other drugstore
sponges I can use instead the Beauty
Blender just because you know
who doesn't like to save some money then
I got this last product from Ulta that
I'm so excited about this is the Eco
tools beautifully bronzed blush but this
is the Eco tools beautifully bronze
brush set for the ultimate glow has only
good brushes look so stinkin pretty so
they're saying this is all face brushes
right here keep in mind you can use
brushes for whatever you prefer
but I think they do look absolutely
stunning and then you do get two of
these sponges right here kind of with
the flat edge these sponges are really
nice as well I mainly bought it forward
the brushes I can't remember the
holidays anyone else to do this just
impatient
you get a little carrying case with your
brushes that has a little button on it
I'll probably never use that to be
honest with you these are gonna be so
pretty this would be really nice for
blush oh you have like this little
duo-fiber one right here which I thought
would be great to blend out product I
love to a fiber brushes right now I use
one from the drugstore that's from the
MUA brand this is one of my favorite
brushes ever and then again you do have
these other three brushes here that you
could use and then the sponges so that
is everything that I purchased from Ulta
that was new I really hope you guys
