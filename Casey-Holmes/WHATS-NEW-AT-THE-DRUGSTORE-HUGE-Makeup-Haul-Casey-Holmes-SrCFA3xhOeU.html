today we are doing a drugstore haul
now I quickly want to say I just I just
want to say I don't know how this
happened okay I really don't I waited
for things for dupes and I came out with
this and this is not one trip this is
like multiple trips so don't judge me
too hard it's for you guys though
actually it's for you I'm gonna share
with you guys everything that I
purchased I also got some things from
Ulta but I will share where I got
everything when I show it to you okay so
as I was looking for this airspun powder
that I eventually found at Walmart I
went to Walgreens and I saw these two
pallets from L'Oreal I think they're
absolutely stunning especially this blue
palette and this one is called blue noot
I don't know it's number 108 and then
this one is 104 French biscuit
aren't they stunning L'Oreal does have
really good eyeshadows what is it
they're like pressed pigment ones are
really nice that you know drugstore
eyeshadows sometimes are disappointing
so we're going to see if these are these
look like super crazy in the pan like
they're flat I don't know I don't know I
can't explain it but they look crazy
weird if you buy it if you've bought one
and looked at it doesn't it look odd
like it's just so perfectly compacted in
there and like clean so we've got a
mid-tone brown which looks really
promising it's blue oh these are looking
super nice for drugstore so there are
the four shades right there I want to
put these on my eyes as soon as possible
I think they are absolutely stunning so
again that was 108 and then this one is
104
I'm not going to swatch everything in
this video if there's something you want
me to do video on then let me know in
the comments I just have so much to get
through but this is so stunning a little
bit of blue on this singer but these are
the colors in that one and they're
really soft and pigmented and I have
really high hopes for these so let me
know if you want to see a video on them
so as I was in CVS I went to the MUA
section which is the makeup Academy I
guess what do they call this yeah makeup
Academy they have a little section in my
CVS and I actually use their stippling
brush and I've been using it for a while
I
absolutely love this brush so I decided
to buy another one because it's always
nice to have to write this brand is a
little bit more pricey in the drugstore
but from my experience it's really good
at least with the brushes so I wanted to
get another duo fiber brush and then I
also got this double ended contour and
highlighter brush and I don't know I
just wanted to try it out
I've been trying out lots of drugstore
brushes and everything so I want to get
to the point where I can do a full
makeup tutorial with drugstore brushes
and drugstore makeup so I'm just kind of
trying things out try and find the best
ones out there this is called the
pressed powder brush and I can't really
tell if this was like a kabuki brush oh
it's tiny it's just like a little baby
so it's a little bit thinner as you can
see and the handle is really small I
don't know what I'm gonna use this for
I mean maybe foundation I'll have to try
it out next up from that same brand I
haven't tried any other eyeshadows so I
want to pick up two palettes this one
palette is more neutral this one's
called the nude eyeshadow palette as you
can see and then I also picked up the
smokey eye shadow palette which looks
like this so this one's more purple blue
tones and a nice smoky black then this
one's obviously more of your Browns and
just neutral colors and taupe so I'm
excited to play with them
so that's them on my fingers you can see
they're super pigmented when I swatch
them with my fingers okay next up I did
get a couple things from ELF I have some
more I believe but I think they're in
the other bag but I want to try out this
blending sponge and I actually got this
on Ulta calm now I did sneak a couple
fingers in there and try to see what
kind of sponge this is going to be and
it's pretty dense I mean it's a little
bit forgiving but it's pretty dense and
now I'm getting eyeshadow all over it
fantastic then I also got this Sonia
Kashuk number 31 precision pencil brush
and I wanted to just see if this was a
dupe for the Mac one that I have I
forget the number of the Mac one also
from ELF I got this prism eyeshadow and
this is just called the prism eyeshadow
says ultra silky eyeshadows that look
like powder but feel like a cream to
create a smooth and flawless application
so that's what the packaging looks like
we're just gonna you know I said I was
going to swatch everything but it seems
like that's what's happening with me
right now
it's them swatch it they don't know if
you guys can see it I don't know how
these are going to work on the lid buts
watching them they're very buttery and
they're really really soft I just don't
know how well they're going to apply on
the lid with a brush but we'll just have
to see and I also got this elf
mattifying translucent powder and I just
want to try it out because you guys know
I'm oily and I'm all about trying
different powders right now Maybelline
butter skin powder is my go-to but I
figured out try out this one because elf
has some good powders and I honestly
have high hopes for this is a bronzer
from ELF I got this online at Ulta as
well it's their pressed mineral bronzer
of a hair my lip got it and I'm actually
wearing one of the bronzers today but
it's not this one this one's a little
too dark for me this is in beached
bronze maybe if I'd become a little bit
more tan before the end of the summer I
will use this but it's very very dark I
mean you can also use it as an eyeshadow
it's just a Hello it's just a really
deep bronzer with some golden shimmer in
there it's just it's a super soft powder
you guys and they blend really really
well so that's the color right there
very very dark definitely for more tan
to deep skin tones but the formula is
really nice and so far I'm loving the
one that I'm wearing because it just
looks so stinkin free a couple of
foundations I have not tried this but
I'm really excited to try it out I don't
know what the difference is oh maybe
because one's matte but got to cover all
foundations one of them is way too light
for me what was I thinking I don't know
but they're both the covergirl clean one
just says oil-control and one says Matt
I don't know if they're different I
don't know if this one's mattifying and
this one's not I figured I would pick it
up to test it out maybe when I'm a
little bit more fair I'll try this or I
might go buy another one if you've tried
this foundation let me know what you
think and if there's a difference
between these two let me know because I
just realized one said Matt and one
didn't but I figured it was just like
new packaging so let me know if you've
tried this and if you liked it also get
this elf eyebrow pencil in the color
taupe so taupe was the only color I
could find and I think this packaging is
really cute it's all white and it says
it's new so I love finding new stuff
it's nice it's creamy but it's a little
bit dry as well but there's taupe if
you're wondering I think this is gonna
work out for me I'm not a huge
brow pencil kind of person but this is
from elf and I really want to try it so
I'm going to test it out for you guys
then I finally found these gems and
these are the wet and wild shimmers like
the shimmer palettes and these are the
highlighters that they came out with
that I've been wanting to try but can
never find this is the one I'm most
excited about this is the shade I'll
have a Cosmo actually we'll have a Cosmo
that would be very nice so that's what
it looks like right there it's
definitely more of a pink shimmery color
which I'm not usually a big fan of but I
think once it's on the face I'll enjoy
it you can kind of see right there how
pretty it is
it's very pigmented very soft so I'm
excited to try that out and then I also
got the color boozy brunch which just
looks like this oh yeah this one's more
of like the golden highlighter I think
this one's gonna be more up my alley
great swatching Kacey you're youtuber
would have never guessed and I think it
looks absolutely stunning it's
definitely more of a golden highlight
but I cannot wait to try this one on my
face couple more things I did when I try
this out because I don't think I've ever
tried this one out it's the Maybelline
Dream matte mousse natural beige oh
that's the color this is the foundation
and I've never tried this one before I
don't remember yeah I've just never I've
never tried it it's been around for a
long time but I don't think I've gotten
my hands into it so I'm excited to test
this out and see if it works
especially since I'm loving the better
skin one right now and then I got this
one online as well at Ulta this is the
number seven shimmer palette in Rose so
it is more of a rosy tone hits the name
rose it can look a little bit ashy but I
really do like it I think I like it a
nice tan but you can see it's just for
the creamy it's very pigmented and just
beautiful so shout out to drugstore for
coming through with the highlighter so
the next things I got are from Walmart
and I wanted to try out this flower
beauty line this is the powder up loose
powder from flower beauty and wow that
is chunky ass packaging for a small
thing anyways so this is what it looks
like it's very chunky and big this is
the color lo1 comes with the puff and I
just want to try and see how good the
powder
is you know pressed powders stuff to
bake with I'm always on the hunt for
find a lot along the way but it's just
fun to keep trying more and trying to
find the next best thing so I definitely
wanted to give that a try then I also
got this lighten up
brightening concealer it says it's a
soft focused complex it gives you like a
little within effect and it has seamless
coverage just wanted to try that out
that's what it looks like right there
it's a pretty big bottle and then I have
never seen this before have you guys
seen it haven't even heard you might
talk about it this is a l'oreal
appellate newton tint they came to play
with the packaging like look at that
that's what got me was the packaging so
i haven't played with the other nude
palettes I know I bought one but I just
never used it I ended up giving it to a
friend because I heard terrible reviews
on it that's a couple of the shades
swatch they look pretty nice but as
always finger swatches are a little bit
different than putting them on the eyes
but hopefully I mean they don't look
terrible they look really pretty this is
more of a plummy taupe palette so that's
what it looks like and I'm pretty
impressed with how big these shadows are
though this I got from CVS and I tried
it today and I really liked it this is a
Neutrogena Healthy Skin blush in 20 I
have it on my face but I lightly applied
it and this is a really pigmented blush
but it blends out so well you can use
less of this product and have a nice
rosy glow you can use a lot more to have
really intense blushed cheeks but I love
the color of this it's a really soft
powder and again this blends very very
well I was really impressed by this so
that's what it looks like it looks more
hot pink swatched and actually looks on
my skin again like I said I have it on
but I just have a really little amount
because I didn't want to overpower the
eyes but I love the packaging I think
it's really sleek I know what okay oh
that Maybelline came out with a little
gem like this and everybody would like
hated it everybody hated it and this is
by the brand Beauty 360 and as I was in
CVS I just want to test it out because
this is a CVS brand by the way I just
want to test it out so I opened this up
and I felt the sponge and I was like mmm
that's a little bit more bouncy than the
Maybelline one I mean it feels like it
might be a little bit better I don't
know
you guys I'm just trying to test it out
be the guinea pig so I'll let you know
how this goes we'll see if I can use it
maybe for under the eyes now that I put
it underneath my eyes it is a little
stiff but I'm going to put it underwater
see how it works you know this is such
like a good concept but it's so hard for
people to get a good sponge on the top
of those sticks then I got this elf
flawless face brush and I'm going to put
out packaging because you can't really
see it I just wanted to try this out you
can never have too much is in my opinion
and I thought this one would be really
pretty for bronzer or powder and once
you wash it it's going to kind of fluff
up like that so yeah isn't it gorgeous
elf has great brushes and this is super
soft okay so this one is the bronzer I'm
wearing right now I'm wearing it as my
contour and to bronze up the skin so
this is the eyes lips face pressed
mineral bronzer in the shade caramel
cabana this is my perfect shade right
now and I love love love these it's like
a nice mixture between warm and ashy
tones it's like that perfect shade just
like the other one it's really soft easy
to blend and I'm just loving this one I
have a feeling this is going to be my
new favorite bronzer so again this is
the color caramel cabana and I harped it
speaking of bronzers I got this
Neutrogena Healthy Skin natural radiance
bronzer and sunkissed if you're new try
it out it looks like a really nice warm
bronzer maybe something just to warm up
the skin with ooh now that I put it on
my skin looks a little orange can you
guys see that no no let's put it over
here
so now that I put all my arms it looks
more like a salmon color but this
obviously my forearms are a lot more
fair than the rest of my body but we'll
see it seems like it blends out very
well and has a nice formula so I will
keep you guys updated on this I love
bronzers always looking for new ones so
I can't wait to try that out and then
speaking of bronzers I dig it
dispositions formula one I'm not a huge
Physicians Formula fan I just never
found anything that I like really love
from them but this is the powder palette
multicolored bronzer for medium skin
tones and that's just what it looks like
right there it's like a mosaic powder of
different colors like I said I just
never find anything really great from
Physicians Formula I feel like they're
overpriced and their products just like
don't
back up the price you know what I'm
saying so sorry Physicians Formula you
just want to mix them all together to
get Wow that is dark as dark oh my god
this is more of like a red tone bronzer
right there I don't know if I'm going to
use that for much I know it's for medium
skin tones maybe as a contour or
something that's what it looks like but
it's a lot darker than I expected uh but
I am kind of impressed the formula again
is really nice and blended out very well
so we'll see I mean that doesn't look
bad to me okay so the next thing is this
Neutrogena Healthy Skin three and one
concealer for eyes says it conceals and
nourishes and instantly reduces the look
of dark circles and puffiness it's in
this like ball mask packaging and then I
saw this and I was just super interested
in it and this is limited edition
it's the wet and wild color icon lip
gloss and raised on good corals ooh I
like the applicator very nice very nice
holds a lot of product and it is super
pigmented Wow
wet and wild look at you so excited to
try that out I bet it's gonna be really
good night for tomorrow I know it sounds
like a vanilla II smell mmm
so pretty it's not sticky ooh I like
that you can't really smell it when it's
on your lips which is good because I'm
sensitive to smell if the lipgloss is
really potent or lipstick and I can
smell it in my nose constantly it's
going to give me a headache but I don't
really smell this at all it does feel
really good though it's just like a
sight it is kind of like that fake
vanilla scent but it smells good it
reminds me of my childhood like lip
smackers and just all that stuff and
then I did get this NYX lip gloss and
natural I'm not going to swatch this
because some people want me to try this
out for a dupes video so for my next one
this one will be used with something
else which I'm not telling you yet
you'll just have to stay tuned so this
is the Physicians Formula super baby
insta ready contour trio BB stick and
I've never tried this it looked
interesting maybe I'll do like a
drugstore trying new products first
impressions video would you guys want to
see that let me know and I'll include a
lot of these drugstore products then I
also got this NYC City proof 24-hour
waterproof
what am I try and say I got this
eyeliner from NYC it says this
waterproof in 24 hours I got it in the
shade black we will
see how it works looks pretty promising
to me kind of like one of those gel
pencils then I also got this elf regular
and waterproof mascara duo which i think
is the coolest concept ever that way you
don't have to buy two mascaras you can
just buy this one so I don't know we'll
have to see if it's actually like
waterproof I'm probably going to go to
lake this weekend and I'm a test this
out even though I never wear makeup to
the lake or the pool or anything like
that um I'll do it for the tube then I
got this NYX lingerie liquid lip in a
beauty mark this just looked really
pretty I remember trying one of these
out and I really loved the color so if
you're going to give this one a go
that's pretty it's a little sheer that's
okay got it kind of build it up but
that's the color it's like a really nice
chocolate brown that's stunning again
this is in the shade beauty mark but
this is from the mua makeup academy
brand again and these are their liquid
lipsticks I haven't heard anybody talk
about them nor have I seen anybody
swatch them so we're gonna see if
they're good hopefully they are really
great packaging very very pretty this
one's in the shade brick number 200 so
I'm loving the applicator that's what it
looks like wow that is so pigmented and
isn't that such a gorgeous color the
very rosy color Wow and it's like drying
already like honestly that was one
swatch look at this that is insane I
can't wait to use that and then this
one's in the shade 205 nude oh girl so
that is number 205 nude doesn't that
look like the most perfect nude ever
right there if you guys are wondering
that is so stunning the formula is like
really creamy so I can't wait to put
these on my lips let me know if you guys
don't see a video using all of the
anyway products but I figured I would
try this no crease eyeshadow primer
because I love my NARS one it's hard to
beat it because it's literally the only
one that has like made my eyeshadow stay
in place for years and I have really
oily eyelids so I struggle with trying
to find the perfect base and that one's
like my go-to but we'll see if this one
works this is
a universal shade and they say it dries
sheer so now that I'm all washed up I am
done with this video I really hope you
guys enjoyed it let me know in the
comments what videos you want to see
using these drugstore products and I
will start working and put them out for
you guys I love you thank you so much
for watching and don't forget to give
this video a thumbs up and subscribe if
you're not already and I will see you
all in my next video
