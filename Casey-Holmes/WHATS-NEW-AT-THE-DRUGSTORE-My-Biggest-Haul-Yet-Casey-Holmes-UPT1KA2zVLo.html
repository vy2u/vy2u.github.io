if you're wondering why my hair is all
messed up and I'm in like this comfy
sweater it is because I just got back
from the drugstore not too long ago and
I just could not wait to film a haul for
you guys so that is what I'm filming
right now if you follow me on snapchat
you know that I went to to Walgreens and
literally I went and going to Walgreens
signal's gonna find my just a few things
you know nothing crazy I walk out with a
receipt as long I cannot believe I found
almost everything new at the at
Walgreens literally I was going in and
the girl was stocking the shelves and I
was like taking things left and right
like rows and rows because I wanted to
do swatch videos I'm sorry to her I told
her that I blogged about that kind of
stuff so that's why I was taking it all
but I feel so bad because literally she
was putting it out and I was like
clearing her out this is for you guys I
hope you're excited drugstore makeup is
like one of the most exciting things to
me just because it's so accessible it's
affordable and it's just fun to try out
I hope you guys are excited to see
everything that I found I can't wait to
do like wear tests for you swatches just
different dedicated videos on these
products lots of drugstore coming to you
I don't know about you guys but those
are my favorite Hey so we're gonna start
with the big back first have a table
here that's gonna assist me let's just
talk about the fact that wet wild I fall
Fulda split I fall see I camera talking
so excited i when I walked in the first
display that I saw was wet and wild and
I love when wild I think they have lots
of great products so I'll put a picture
right here that I posted on snapchat and
I was like Jack frickin taught me show
you some of the things that I got these
things are going to be in order because
it's all shuffled I just threw things
into a basket and she threw them in the
bag first thing I got was this wet and
wild lash grenade multi-dimensional
mascara in brazen black it just looked
really cool it looked very promising so
I wanted to test this out next up are
some sponges I've seen these online I've
been very very excited to try them out
so I cannot wait to let you know what I
think but these three sponges are by
L'Oreal and we have the concealed
blender the foundation blender and then
also the contour blender so these look
awesome
look promising they're very pretty and I
love the packaging so thumbs up to
L'Oreal for a first impression even if
you didn't know that these were out this
like just draws you in doesn't it just
look so pretty except we have this
L'Oreal infallible total cover conceal
palette this is like a conceal and
contour palette I got the shape 220 and
I just thought this was super cool it
has different shades in here so as you
guys know I do self tan though this
would be great for me under eyes and
like to contour if I wanted to now this
obviously got me because it says Matt
you had me at Matt the covergirl outlast
all day Matt's a finishing powder and
it's for light to medium it says it's a
new look so I don't know if this is like
that blue line that covergirl hat but I
can't wait to try this out I kind of
like this packaging better oh this looks
so beautiful it is this palette right
here this is the true Naked Jules
it says looks designed by Pat McGrath
which that is super cool because if you
guys know Pat McGrath does have a line
in Sephora it is pretty expensive and
this is a more affordable option so a
bunch of different tutorials you could
do back here and I think this is just so
pretty and I can't wait to try it out I
don't know if this is brand new I feel
like it it that looks pretty promising
so that's the green this blue this one
blue okay I have another little L'Oreal
kit this is the correcting one so you
have the different tones you have the
one that does the dark circles combats
discoloration neutralizes redness and
then brightens which is the lavender
does come with a little sponge as does
the other one in case you were wondering
I got some more of my favorite deodorant
the secret clinical strength Ella
lavender I prefer a non antiperspirant
deodorant but you know I stink if I
don't get that and then I also got some
through paste because you can never go
wrong with some toothpaste I use Colgate
I love Colgate I've been using them for
a Liman how long moving on to cover oil
again this one just looks so cool it's
the covergirl lash blast Pro mascara
says the lash finder bold sexy lashes
for all lash types at the color oh
I got waterproof it'll be alright at the
color extreme black again the packaging
so nice also another product from when
wild that is new
it is the dual-ended contour stick I got
this shade light/medium hopefully this
will be dark enough for me I'm more
light like out self-tan but I let it
fade off for about a week until I
reapply so what is something in between
there that I could try out I figured
this would be a good set to try I think
I'm going to do a whole wet-and-wild
test it out video for you guys because
they had a full-on display
another cool game next up we have
another L'Oreal product it is the brow
stylist frame and set I got the shade
light brunette this just looked really
promising I can't wait to try it out I
love brow pomade I love it when I see
the drugstore come out with a brow
pomade I often see that they come out
with you know the brow pencils I'm not a
big fan of them I like pomade
so I had to give that one a try
covergirl also came out with this
outlast all-day soft touch concealer I
got the shade light/medium kind of the
same package as the powder next up we
have this Revlon blush in tickled pink
they had a ton of different blushes but
this one drew my attention I didn't
really want to buy all of them because
sometimes I'm not a big fan of roll-on
I'm just sometimes Revlon doesn't
impress me but this blush looked really
pretty look like something I could wear
everyday
does have some shimmer in it but we'll
see how it goes and they're saying that
this is a new shade so I cannot wait to
test this out it's a little bit darker
than how it's coming off on camera then
I got two shades you guys have been
wanting to try this for a minute l'oreal
infallible total cover full coverage
weightless feel foundations
24 hour foundation which is a hell of a
claim I got the shade 305 and a 308 I'm
not too sure what shade I'm going to be
again because I do self tan but
hopefully I'll be in between these mix
them together or I'll be one of them he
did try out these new NYX total coverage
foundations and I did not like them you
want a full video on why I do not like
this product please let me know in the
comments I was very disappointed because
I was so excited about this product now
we have a wet and wild photo focus
foundation and this is in the shade
cream beige it says it was tested in
under 7 light conditions with top
smartphone models with and without flash
and it says goodbye photo flash back
supposedly you're not supposed to have
flash back with this I believe I got
another shade of this as well just
because I fluctuate so very excited to
try this out lovely bottle it's a glass
bottle very luxurious Jordana came out
with a ton of different stuff and I
decided to pick up two of these products
from their contour line so I have the
Jordana sculpting go creamy contour
stick in the shade media also the
Jordana glowing go creamy strobing stick
these just look so stinkin pretty and I
just wanted to test them out they're
given me who had this who had this kind
of packaging was it revelant
I think Revlon had this kind of
packaging for contour then I also picked
up the covergirl
easy breezy brow shape and defined brow
mascara and I got the shade golden
blonde because it's reminded me of my
Anastasia brow gel in brunette so
hopefully this is going to be kind of
the same thing where lightens the brows
as like little highlights to make them
look more natural also from wet and wild
I did get this photo focus pressed
powder in the shade a neutral buff and
again this says it doesn't have any
flashback anything like that has same
claims as a foundation so we will
definitely test both of those let's just
talk about the damn liquid lipstick
craze that is going on right now Jordana
came out with so many liquid lipsticks
I'm talking a shade for absolutely
anyone I'm pretty sure this all them if
not there's probably some roaming
throughout the other bags that I have
those are some of the shades right there
I want to do a full swatch and wear test
video on these and also the ones I'm
about to show you up next so I got all
of the colors just so we could test them
all out and see what colors are worth
you purchasing then went wild also
dropped a liquid lipstick this is a
liquid
catsuit matte lipstick I think a couple
of these shades has been out before but
I have not been able to test them out
but again
Holi colors they have so many shades
they have a shade for literally everyone
here the some of the color is very very
pretty cannot wait to test these out for
you guys also did get
another contour stick from Jordanna in
the shade deep just to see if medium or
deep would work best for my skin tone on
to our last baggie purchase any went
well definitely try to check out a
coupon you can save a dollar on this
foundation and they have some shades
back here to kind of help you find your
perfect shade again I got another one of
those foundations in the shade desert
beige and then thing I saw online when
they came out with these cushion
products and I was just so intrigued and
could not wait to try them out because
this is the coolest packaging ever so
you have a cushion contour and a cushion
highlighter and these just look so cool
don't they like they look awesome so
that went wild had some new highlighters
I'm pretty sure these are new I have not
seen these before I know they came out
with some of these highlighters but I'm
pretty sure that they were other colors
I think these are new shades so it says
knit one is in the shade precious petals
and the other one is in crown of my
canopy here we go all of our
highlighting dreams coming true at the
drugstore you guys we have some more
Jordana wet-and-wild
Jordana Jordana liquid lipstick wow
that's a pretty color so is this one I
also picked up two of these Maybelline
Baby Lips color bombs and they're
basically just a moisturizing oil I
guess like a just a bomb that has oils
in it to moisturize your lips so that's
one of the shades this one Z shade
twisted taupe I think I'm gonna put this
on right now booboo that's what it looks
like a little nude very pigmented more
pins than I expected
mmm they smell good okay that's a little
too new okay they remind me of something
I just can't put my finger on it like it
smells like a product I've tried from
the drugstore and I really liked it just
gives me beach vibe so I have two of
these wet and wild makeup sticks and
they're both in conceal and this is the
shade 808 and this is 809 they had a ton
of different sticks out can go check
them out at your local Walgreens or
whatever but I just picked up these two
shades to try as concealers and just to
see how they work I picked
this mascara because I thought it'd be
great for the lower lash line it's the
wet-and-wild get the skinny every lash
big for lower lash line you know I
didn't even read that perfect for a
lower lash line I just thought it would
be so it's a super skinny mascara that's
what it looks like and again I bet it's
gonna be bomb so came out with another
eyeshadow palette this is the au
naturale nude Awakening palette I mean
those colors the back has again little
mini tutorials on it and I also have a
new concealer this is the wet and wild
photo focused concealer again with that
claim of not going to give you flashback
it says it's been tested under clear
blue somewhat sky outdoors in the PM
indoors p.m. electronic flash for light
and light bathroom light nightclub light
in high club like hey also they had a
ton of different colors of the gel lip
liners but I got this one because this
looks like more my color it's in the
shade plum together says it's their
first gel lip liner a first-of-its-kind
gel lip liner is specifically formulated
with the gel complex to deliver
innovation with the ultimate performance
and comfort seamless flawless
application no tugging and no dragging
and it delivers neverending color can't
wait to test that out and this was says
bear to comment so I dig it one more I
lied and then I did get the wet and wild
gel lip balm in the shade tell says it's
a smooth application lasting moisture
sheer and glossy it looks like it's like
an orange tint okay
very glossy doesn't really have a
sandwich I kind of enjoy because the
last thing that I got is this mega
cushion soft matte lip cream which is so
dope I think they have multiple colors
but I got the shade melon like it is and
it looks very very pretty kind of just
right up my alley
so I mean this packaging is just
adorable
so that is everything I got from the
drugstore I will definitely be doing a
full wet-and-wild video just of all the
stuff that I got from them I'll be
testing them out letting you know what
you should try out and what's good you
know what it means so what in onenote is
