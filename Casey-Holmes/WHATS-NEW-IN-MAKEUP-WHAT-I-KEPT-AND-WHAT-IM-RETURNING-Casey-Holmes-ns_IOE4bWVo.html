to be sharing with you some new up
makeup products I've been trying out may
let you know what I think of them I
figured I would kind of throw a bunch of
things into one video so that way we
could kind of get through these products
and I can let you guys know what I think
because there are so much new stuff out
that it's hard for me to keep up
sometimes you know what I'm saying I
figured I would do a full video
including products that I've tried out
you'll see if they're a hit and miss
these are like hot new items and a lot
of this stuff I love and some of it not
so much so anyway so hope you guys enjoy
this video definitely let me know down
below if you guys want more videos like
this in the future also if you guys
missed I did put my wedding video up on
the vlog Channel I know a lot of you
been wondering about the wedding video
where it's at if you don't follow my
blog channel you haven't seen it it did
upload it over there because that is
like my lifestyle channel and I thought
it just fit perfectly over there you
wanna check that out I will leave a link
down below it's so good I love it so
much and I hope you guys enjoy it as
well
so before we get started if you're not
subscribed be sure to hit that subscribe
button and hit the notification bell if
you want notifications from me if not
you know subscribing is enough so if you
want to see what I think about these new
products watch me try them on give you
some swatches then let's just go ahead
and get started the first thing I'm
gonna kind of go in a random order I
have it all like stacked all over my
table so I'm just gonna do like a random
order so the first thing I want to talk
about is flower beauty now I'm really
excited because you guys know I love
flower beauty I've been purchasing from
them forever and they came out with some
new lip products so I am working with
them to share these lip products with
you guys because I love them they always
have good stuff and I don't recommend
things that I think suck so these are
really really good and I'm excited about
these they have one two three four five
six seven different shades these are
available at Walmart I do have my
favorites right here but I will give you
guys swatches of all of these products
so these are the flower mixed in matte
lip duos this is what the packaging
looks like it is just so gorgeous it's
like a luxurious packaging like when you
hold it and look at it it's so colorful
it's pretty it's very eye-catching I
just love it but it isn't about the
packaging it's about the product so what
I like about this is you kind of have a
two in one you have a matte lipstick and
you also have a gloss and it's the same
exact shade so the lip gloss matches the
lipstick perfectly which
is really great to have sometimes I'm
looking for something that's identical
and normally I just go with a clear
gloss cuz I'm like oh whatever I'm not
gonna find it but I like that it is a
dual ended one with the same color on
each side so let me talk to you about
one of my favorite shades this one is so
pretty and you'll see it when I put it
on my lips here in this clip this one is
in the shade red velvet and this gives
you candy apple lips you guys it is just
so beautiful and one thing I have found
with these products is I haven't had to
use a lip liner with them the top of the
lipstick is so pointy that I just don't
need one so I really like that about it
as well normally I'm always wearing a
lip liner but I find out I have to it
this one but this red velvet shade you
guys I cannot get enough of it a matte
lipstick on these duo's is so creamy
very comfortable to wear and they look
really great on the lips as well they
don't like seeing into fine lines
anything like that they just look really
plumping and pretty the matte side of
this red velvet is pretty and then you
put the pearl eyes gloss on top and it
literally gives you a candy apple effect
now I will say it's like a pearl gloss
so when you put this on you're probably
thinking like oh it's kind of a goopy
gloss Beauvoir no it's not it is not a
thick gloss it is not goopy and none of
that is a nice thin gloss it just has a
really pretty sheen to it and it lasts
so well on top of the lipstick I just
like that it's not a thick layer of
gloss you know what I mean like
sometimes you don't want a thick goopy
layer that your hair's gonna get caught
up in this really does add that shine
but it's not thick and it's not gonna
get all your hair caught up in it you
know I'm saying and then spread it all
over your face it's a really attractive
look that happens to us sometimes I find
that these do wear really beautifully of
course they're kind of like any regular
lipstick they are gonna wear off when
you eat and drink but this red one does
stain your lips so it's not gonna be
like you have patches of skin showing
it's gonna look like a nice red tint so
you won't have to hurry up and reapply
it so my favorite nude out of everything
is this honey nude lip II and it again
has the matte side
I like this nude because it's a little
bit darker I do have it on my lips right
now and it kind of has a pink tint to it
but it's just really pretty
again very creamy the formula of these
is amazing and I've been really really
enjoying them and I will be honest with
you I am NOT a lipstick person but I
really like these a lot because they do
set
really nicely on the lips so you can see
the difference between the mat and then
the pro lies gloss I really love flower
beauty lip products I love their new
liquid lips that they came out with I
love their regular glosses that are a
little bit thicker but they're super
pigmented just like these yeah I just
really enjoyed these products so
definitely go check them out again
they're available at Walmart I'll also
have a link down below if you want to
check them out ok moving on to more
makeup products we have a highlighter
palette okay you guys know I love this
palette so much again like I said I'm
kind of going out of order I'm just kind
of grabbing and showing them to you guys
but this honest Asya glow kit this is
the sugar one is so good I cannot stop
wearing it I'm not kidding this is like
my new go-to I love putting starbursts
all over my cheek and then I will take
marshmallow and hit it right in the
center just to really make it pop this
is so beautiful I feel like it looks
really great on my texture and my pores
it blends out really well and I've just
been incredibly obsessed it just makes
me look so glowy I love it ok moving on
this was not used in the vo but I
figured I would throw it in here because
I believe I included this in the Ulta
haul I love this you guys this is the
blush kit and radiant but honest Asya
but before you buy this let me get to my
next one so just hold on for a second
this is what it looks like is Gore gist
you need to go in with a light hand with
this I mean just tap your brush in there
blend it onto your cheeks and you'll be
fine these three are my favorites I will
probably never use this one it's just
not my kind of shade but I think these
are gorgeous they blend really well look
really great on the skin they are all
matte shades - this little pink one that
has just a few speckles of shimmer in
there but these are matte they're my
favorite I think they're setting who
wants something that is a little bit
more affordable this Sephora winter
flush palette it is so good I'm wearing
it on my cheeks right now and it does
have a mirror kind of just has that same
vibe of the honest Asya one but this one
is thinner so let me let me show you
real quick so the Sephora one is thinner
so all of these blushes do this bigger
part right here all of those are matte
but then you have the shimmer strip on
each one to add a little bit of shimmer
to the blush if that's what you prefer I
personally love mixing these two
together so much and to me these look so
similar
- the shimmer strip like they're very
very similar so both really great again
if you want to save some cash I would go
for the Sephora one you also have the
ability to make them shimmer blushes or
you could just put your brush into the
matte shades so it's just kind of up to
you but I really love both of these I
highly recommend them so for one blends
out really well again very very
pigmented
moving on to some drugstore products
that this is the LA Colors sweet 16 that
color eyeshadow palette I do like this I
mainly use it for the mattes I have a
high-end product in here that didn't
have a lot of transition shades so I
decided to use this one and I really
like it everything blends out pretty
well it's just kind of like a standard
pallet to me it reminds me of like the
Too Faced I think it's the chocolate bar
palette there is more mass than shimmers
and I think this is a good like staple
palette to have if you don't have a
drugstore palette that has a bunch of
different transition shades or a
highlight shade I would go for this one
because it's affordable and everything
blends pretty well and it's pretty
pigmented so I do like this I think this
is great I'm still kind of trying it out
and I need to try out these shimmer
shades a little bit more but so far I do
love the mattes and then I also have
this NYX a three-step to sculpt the face
sculpting palette you guys I love this I
love this more than I thought I would
now I will say this is more of a warm
toned bronzer so some of you might not
like that warm toned look in the contour
line but I don't hate it I think it
looks really good just because it does
blend out so well so I do contour with
this one right here I use that same
morphe brush I mentioned in my last
video which is the m5 at 2/3 just kind
of fluff it in there and blend it
upwards and then I'll go in with this
yellow shade right here with this
Smashbox blurring concealer and I'll
just carve out that contour line let it
bake and then dust it away and it looks
so pretty
I don't really use this highlight shade
it's not my favorite it's not as intense
as I would like it to be but I like two
shades out of the whole palette so I
feel like in a trio if I like two and
not one
I feel like it's okay and it is
drugstore and affordable the other
drugstore bronzer that I have is
actually this number 7 bronzer I don't
think this is super new but it's more
new to me and I love this
hums er so this was in the shade caramel
and it has a little mirror right here as
you can see this is such a good
a shade this is so pretty it reminds me
of the Marc Jacobs fantastic one that
was like in the white package which I
have somewhere back there but this is so
nice it's a drugstore alternative and it
blends really well it looks very smooth
on the skin it's easy to work with
everything you kind of need for a
bronzer is right here it's just so
beautiful and I love it
foundation I feel like I should do a
full video on new full coverage
foundations because there are so many
coming out from the drugstore from
high-end I mean there's a ton which I'm
not complaining about because I love
full coverage foundation news ua1 came
out which I've been trying as well but
I've been trying this one the longest
and I really really liked it I think it
looks beautiful on the skin by far think
that applying it with a bee blender is
my favorite way because I was applying
it with a brush for a while and it does
look really good but I just feel like
the beauty blender really sinks it into
the skin and really gets that excess
product because it is so full coverage
you don't want to leave extra product on
your skin so I love this a lot I use two
pumps this is the shade that's latte 300
and matches my body but of course my
hands can't get their thing they can't
get it together I love this I 100%
recommend it it's lightweight on the
skin it doesn't accentuate pores it's
full coverage it's everything that I
want anymore it's really great for oily
skin as well does have a nice matte
finish but I do have two high end
concealers that I've been trying and
this one is the Laura Mercier candle
glow concealer and highlighter I've been
using this mainly for the outer part I
put like a full coverage concealer in
here and then I highlight with this one
I was using the Maybelline fit me to do
that as well which I still recommend
that one if you don't want to buy this
one I do love the applicator of this I
don't know just something about it it's
so easy to apply I'm using the shade
number one which is great because it's
not too light but it's still a little
bit lighter than my foundation so it
does highlight but this blends out
really well I feel like it just adds a
nice glow to the skin and I've been
really enjoying this with a Tarte shake
tape I highly recommend it if you just
want something lightweight to highlight
with nothing full coverage or anything
like that but just adds a little bit of
Sheen and glow to the skin and then we
have this this is the Urban Decay all
nighter waterproof full coverage
concealer I don't use the all nighter
foundation I feel like it's too drying
on my
and then I like surprisingly because I'm
very oily I just felt like it didn't
look good on my skin and I kind of feel
the same about this one you guys I just
don't know how I feel I sat down to a
matte finish and I kind of show you guys
in the close-ups as well it's like you
can really see my wrinkles in here just
me it kind of looks like it ages me a
little bit if I had to pick between
start shape tape and this one I'm still
leaning towards tart shape tape I also
like the application of tart shaped tape
better because they're dough so it's a a
little bit bigger but it has more
product on it for someone like me who
likes to put on a lot of product I like
it when the dough foot grabs a lot this
one does grab a little bit there at the
tip as you can see but when I put it on
my skin it kind of just feels like I'm
rubbing a dry applicator with a little
bit of product underneath my eyes and I
have to keep dipping back in I love the
packaging I feel like applying it with a
Beauty Blender is best just because that
moisture really helps it blend out
because sometimes I do find it a little
bit difficult to blend again it sets
down to a matte finish I haven't decided
how exactly I feel about it yet but I'm
not overly impressed and I wouldn't pick
it above chart so if that helps you at
all I figured I would mention it I'll
talk about the most disappointing thing
at the very end but I have a few little
knickknacks like liners and then a brow
product this Marc Jacobs liner is the
magic marker water all is cute cos Marc
Jacobs and they put Marc herb waterproof
liquid eyeliner first off I absolutely
love the packaging of this so sleek it
is a felt tip liner and this is very
very black as you can see this is not a
matte eye liner it's just very black and
it's not super shiny as well it's kind
of like that in-between I really like it
again I do have it on my eyes right now
this is hard takeoff I don't disagree
that it's probably waterproof I haven't
tested the waterproof claim yet this is
kind of difficult to take off like I was
trying to take a makeup wipe to it
yesterday and I was like oh my god I'm
gonna be here forever cuz it did not
want to come off think that's great that
it lasts so long especially with it
getting colder my eyes get really really
watery when I go from being outside in
the cold to inside when it's like you
know room temperature kind of warm so
when that happens I just need something
that's not gonna like make it look like
I'm crying my eyes out with black
eyeliner I think this is gonna be really
nice so so far I am loving it this is
pretty new it just came in PR the other
day and take me long to figure out if I
like a liner or not and this one is
definitely gonna be one that I use a lot
next thing we have this monster big brow
this is from Lancome yes I like the idea
of this but I don't like the formula and
I don't like the application I always
love the idea of something being really
simple and like a pencil form that way
you could just go ahead and fill in your
brows really quickly and head out the
door I tried to use this little brush
right here this really didn't do
anything for me I don't know it just it
wasn't my cup of tea to be honest with
you I wish they would have just put a
spoolie at the end I feel like that's a
little bit more practical than this
brush I opened it and first off it was
already kind of broken but it doesn't
have a really nice shape to it it kind
of just wears down to this shape right
here so you can't get like a precise
line you definitely have to go back in
with concealer and clean it up I think
the formula is okay it is a little bit
heavy it kind of has like that waxy feel
to it your brow hairs down which is nice
but it is a little bit heavier you love
the color the color is in blond again
just not my favorite I would prefer my
makeup revolution
brow pomade over this because it's
easier to work with I get a nice precise
application all you need is a brush and
then the last thing that's so
disappointing so disappointing to me
because I absolutely love this brand I
love her stuff and I was pretty excited
about this palette and I'm just a little
bit disappointed this Natasha de Nonna
holiday palette is the holiday eyeshadow
palette 5 and 0 to Ares so this is what
it looks like and then you open it up I
actually really love the packaging of
these my eyeshadows did not fall out I
know they were having some issues with
eyeshadows just kind of like falling out
of these palettes I did not have that
problem which I was super excited about
I have to say I just am not obsessed
with it this shade right here is a dud
in my opinion it's just it's it's not a
Natasha - no no I shadow you know what I
mean like you can see how sheer it is
has a nice shimmer to it but it's not my
favorite this one only shows up which
should I have on my lid right here and
this one only shows up really well if
you use a Too Faced glitter glue or like
mac fix+
same with this one this color is not
even as pretty as it looks unless you
use fixapply so matte is a
our mats are always amazing and this is
okay it's nothing super oh it's just
nothing super good it's kind of a little
bit dry in my opinion for natasha de
Nona favorite shade out of here is the
matte and is this blue when I use fix+
but I don't feel like liking two of the
five shades it's worth me keeping the
palette it's just a little bit
disappointing because I love her eyes
shadows but I feel like these are
different than some of the shades she
has on her palette I don't know if she
has a new formula I hope she didn't have
any formula I'm keeping my palettes if
she does yeah I'm just not impressed by
this I'm a little disappointed in it and
I honestly just am NOT as I'm not pumped
about my look like I normally am when I
use her product this one's gonna go back
for me you guys let me know what you
think about these Natasha Jordana
palettes do you have them have you tried
them I want to know all your thoughts
but that is everything that I have for
you guys today I really hope you enjoyed
this video I had so much fun filming it
I think it's a little bit different and
fun definitely let me know if you guys
want me to continue to do these and yeah
thank you so much for watching and I
will see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
