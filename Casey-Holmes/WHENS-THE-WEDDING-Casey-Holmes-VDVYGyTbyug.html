to be doing a Q&amp;amp;A for you and there's
people going outside but it's fine I get
it I gotta mow my grass too so you know
if you hear it let's just act like it's
your lawnmower you know let's act like
it's your neighbor's lawn mower so I
asked you guys to ask me some questions
on Twitter for me to answer to do it
updated Q &amp;amp; A and I'm going to go
through those now so if you don't follow
me on Twitter you should always have my
Twitter notes on the side I always have
my Twitter and Instagram allocated right
here so if you want to go follow me you
can I would love to have you there also
don't forget to subscribe before you
leave and to hit that cell so you get
notified every time I upload it's like a
saying it really is you know people
haven't been getting notified so if you
have not been getting notified when I
upload a new video hit the bell and you
can request to be notified every time I
do upload so anyways if you guys want to
see me answer some of your questions
then let's go ahead and get started okay
so I asked you guys on my Twitter I'm
going to click the tweet let's refresh
it so I'm just going to click the tweet
and I'm going to go down and answer some
of your questions
this one has 33 favors and it says did
you know Davis was the one when you guys
started dating and I've mentioned this
before but I did know it really is one
of the things where I met him and I was
like oh my gosh this is it this is going
to be like my long-term thing I just
knew it's kind of hard to explain unless
you've been in a situation it's like no
you didn't it's like there's no such
thing as love at first sight which I I
believe it's however you feel in the
moment and once we started talking more
like when I first met him and shook his
hand I was like yes
zit he's hot I like it so once we
started connecting on a personal level I
just knew he was the one so yes I knew
some people don't believe in that but
you know so whatever people want to feel
what is the most trouble you've gotten
in um I I used to be a little shithead
when I was younger I think probably the
most trouble I ever gotten that involved
like really bad consequences was when I
was caught and raised drinking how many
kids do you want to have and how long
before you start trying Davidson I talk
about it all the time
we do want kids I think we've decided on
just two we're going to start trying in
2019 so a couple more years from now
yeah that's only one okay do you have
any advice
on dating because your girl is
struggling out here I have been there
Olivia I was struggling too before I met
Davis my biggest I have said it so many
times but honestly it's just you can't I
don't know know what you want don't
settle for less and also don't go out
looking for a boyfriend I feel like
that's when you never really find your
true love I feel like they just it just
happens it's one of those things where
it's state and if you just let it go and
have fun and your own thing it's going
to come to you have you lived in Georgia
at your whole life are you nervous to
move to a new state I am pretty nervous
to move to New York so if you don't know
Davis is going to be stationed in New
York so we're moving between April and
May it's going to be hectic you guys
honestly it's gonna be so hectic so
doing lots of pre filming right now I am
excited I don't know I'm excited I'm not
going to think negative about it until I
get up there and decide if I like it or
not so I'm a little nervous I'm going to
miss Georgia a lot but it's a new
adventure and we'll see how it goes
someone said have you ever wanted to
adopt another pet besides dogs I
actually want to farm really really
really bad Davis knows one of the
biggest things that I want whatever we
get a house and we're set in stone and
we're permanent is a cow I really want
to rescue a cow and have one I know
that's like a little different I just
really want to rescue cows and things
like that and rescue like goats and just
all different types of animals yeah
that's probably one thing I miss I've
told you guys that the first animal that
I want to rescue other than a dog when
we get a big house with a barn is a cow
and I'm going to name her Bessie Melissa
said what is one thing you have to have
at your wedding and know what matter
what flowers I have to have flowers by
my flower than my wedding it's not a
wedding okay it's just not working so
actually I'm having lots of flowers and
just floral arrangements that are just
beautiful so flowers have to be the
number one pigs that question if you
could collab with any other line who
would it be and what would you create I
think next up I would love to create
lashes I would love to collab with
someone affordable like I'll or and do
like faux mink lashes I think that would
be amazing I know they just collaborated
with some youtubers and I think that's
amazing but I have found that they're
faux mink lashes are so amazing and
they're affordable I would love to just
collab and have a false lash because I
love false lashes and there's so much
fun and then
different brand I would probably want to
collab with I don't know maybe
Maybelline or something like that and
come out with like a bronzer or
something so many guys are asking about
class you should definitely stay tuned
okay
Thank You Miranda studies don't open a
no-kill shelter by the way my pub
business watching your posts on blogs
and stuff
I think he's Christian love you that is
so cute I definitely want to open a
no-kill shelter one day I think it's
going to be one of those things where
over time I'm just going to have to
really save money and have it all pile
up and then when I retire I could open
it then I don't know it's a lot of money
to do something like that but it's
something I love so I mean if I won the
lottery I would do it tomorrow Samantha
said what are you looking forward to
most about the move / wedding love you
love you too I'm so excited about the
wedding I'm just so excited to say I do
you know what I mean I'm so I'm just so
excited about the whole wedding and for
the zoo I think I'm just really excited
to meet new people see what's going to
like living up there and just kind of
trying to adjust Briana said you ever
see yourself not on YouTube in the near
future so crazy for to think about
YouTube without you so I really want to
know I don't think I'll quit YouTube for
a long time I think even when I started
family I'll have family vlogs and
everything I think vlogs will be one of
the main things that keeps me going for
a long period of time make us channels
don't know how long it's gonna go for
you know there's always hot new faces
coming in and you know you never know
where your channel can go for like
beauty wise I would love to stay on this
channel as long as I can because I love
makeup it's my passion
I look forward to talking to you guys
about makeup getting excited about it
and just having fun so I want I'm going
to keep this channel as long as I can
and if this ever dies off I'm so that my
vlog Channel and like have family laws
and things like that Morgan said why
you'd be doing wedding blogs once all
about planning it I do have one wedding
video up now for those of you who don't
know I have a vlog channel is camping
homes blogs 91 I have done my first like
wedding log video like and just
including it in it but I did hire a
planner to do everything she is doing
everything planning it all so I don't
have to do too much I mean when I go
wedding-dress shopping and when I like I
bought things for my bridesmaids and
maid of honor and I put that in the wall
but like when I go do stuff like that
that I
to do for the wedding I will belong it
but I can't vlog like calling about
flowers and stuff because that's what my
wedding planner is going to do and she's
going to court make pretty much
everything very excited to have her
she's gonna help me out of time
especially with moving and everything
favorite comfort food would have to be
chicken and dumplings without the
chicken
everybody always roasts me and like
sighs Casey want you to say dumplings
because I swear if you didn't Cracker
Barrel or something and you just say
dumpling they'll give you the chicken
you gotta say no chicken dumplings are
so good that's my comfort food
I could eat bowls of chicken and
dumplings someone says what are you
