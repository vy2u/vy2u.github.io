today I'm filming a winter clothing haul
and Tryon so excited about this because
I got a lot of great things and that I
can't would share with you I went to
Express
they were having like 50% off everything
it was before Christmas I also got some
items after Christmas as well like the
day after I didn't know that they had
crazy sales going on the day after
Christmas which like blows my mind I'm
gonna show you guys my favorite items
that I picked up let you know where I
got them and they're all and is big ol
Free People Beck these bags are pretty
much phenomenal really quickly I also
wanna let you guys know about an
ultimate care package that foxy locks is
now put together for you guys if you
have purchased their extensions based
off my recommendations first off thank
you so much I'm glad you trust me enough
to try their hair out I absolutely love
it if you see me with long thick
luscious hair it's these extensions I've
talked about them for over a year now
but they came out with this little set I
thought would be awesome to let you guys
know what's in it and what everything is
so I'm just going to show you really
quickly so we can get to the clothes so
they have one of these extension bags
which is amazing you could just clip
your extensions on the hanger put them
in here zip them up and it's great for
traveling because you don't want your
hair extensions just to be floating
around everywhere again tangles so this
is awesome I love it and it's super long
so you're super long extensions are
gonna fit in this bad boy they also have
one of these two tangler brush which you
can also use on your real hair and on
your extensions but I love detangler
brushes I don't use hard bristle brushes
anymore like I have it for the longest
time but they have this for your
extensions which is great because it's
not going to pull and tug that hair out
and then they also have an argan oil
that comes in a set as well I can again
use this on your real hair and on your
extensions and it says that it's infused
with a blend of Moroccan argan oil which
is really good to help keep hair silky
and smooth repairing dry damaged hair
and extensions so I'll leave a link for
that ultimate package down below if you
are interested just because if you do
purchase those extensions they are kind
of pricey and it's important to take
care of them so I think that would be a
great little scent to keep with you and
it's gonna last you a really long time
don't forget to subscribe hit that like
button and also if you do subscribe you
can hit that Bell right beside it and
that's gonna notify you every time I
upload a video if you want to see all of
my newest favorite once your clothing
items then
let's just go ahead and get started I
was cleaning my room the other day and I
just packed these in here in no
particular order so I'm probably gonna
go back and forth with where each piece
is from this is from ASOS it's from the
brand River Island that's one of my
favorite brands from ASOS or like just
brands in general so again it has that
nice turtleneck you'll see in the Tryon
when I show you this because it's always
hard to show black clothing on camera
but it does have the cold shoulder and
it's just like a regular turtleneck I
just love that it has the cold shoulder
detail I don't have any turtlenecks like
this and it's a nice thick fabric so I
really liked that and then from Express
again like I said I got everything 50%
off which was insane so if you watch my
vlog from the day I went Christmas
shopping if you don't know I have a vlog
channel and I'll leave that down below
if you wanna check it out I did show me
trying this on in the dressing room and
this is from Express you can see it just
has like little keyholes and I guess you
could just call it crochet and it has a
higher neck it's not necessarily a
turtleneck but it is a little bit higher
and it's kind of like a cropped sweater
with a really thick band at the bottom I
love this it's great for those days
where it's not super cold but not super
hot it's just like one of those nice
chilly days and I also got to blankets
scarves these were originally 39.92 ghin
are down for 20 dollars so I loved this
color I just think these are such
gorgeous colors I've been really into
finding the scars that kind of have a
different color scheme that I don't have
I have a lot of plain blanket scars but
not a lot of pattern and colorful ones
so I love the pop of light neon yellow
and the gray I think it's just really
really pretty and then this one I have
an outfit ready to be worn with this one
if you could just get a little bit
colder that'd be great
I'll be on Instagram to see that outfit
cuz it's coming soon but I love the
color of these again it's that same
amount as well it's a blanket scarf it's
comfy its soft and the colors love this
can't show you guys the outfit that I
have in mind to wear that with this is
another purchase from ASOS and I
normally don't purchase adidas some
people say addi does differently I don't
know how you say it but you know what
I'm talking about and I thought this was
super cute very different I haven't seen
anyone wear anything like this so soft
ASOS
this one looks like it's just like a
track jacket I guess you could say it's
not very thick at all so it's something
that I would definitely put over my gym
clothes like when I'm heading to the gym
if I'm a little chilly but it's just
gray and white but what's different is
it has this lace up detail here on the
side it actually is open so you do want
to either tie them up or do something
with it that's what it looks like it
kind of has like that tweed look to it
and I thought it was really pretty with
the gray and white stripes again from
Express I actually got this in black as
well it was originally Wow
5950 was originally 5950 can you believe
that so get in half off I love this I
tried this on as well it has this
lace-up lattice detail in the front and
it is pretty long and it does go into a
round bottom and it's not fully sleeves
so you can see right there again I love
this green you'll see in a minute I
really love this like army green color
or just you know hunter green I don't
know people have different ways of
saying it comfy it's soft then I got
this crocheted sweater and it also got
in red because I love the way it looks
this kind of sits differently up top
here on your neck and collarbone area
but I really do like it
and it's just a really nice thick
crochet sweater I like it a lot does
have that open crochet in the back so
again you can wear a bra you can wear
brawl it whatever you want to do and
yeah I liked it so much that I got it in
cream and red I feel like whenever I
find sweatshirts or something that I
like I buy it in multiple colors because
I know I'm gonna wear it a lot next up
and I think last yes last is Free People
that's actually where the sweaters from
you're going to see another color in
here I bought a lot of different colors
in this because it is so comfy and I
love the style and fit of it you're
gonna see it very soon just has like
that batwing top and it's just so
comfortable but some things were on sale
they were having like a 40% off sale
thing it was the day after Christmas I
saw this I don't think this was on sale
but I just loved it I thought it was so
cool such a great layering piece it's
just that hunter green again with this
little beaded detail Davis was making
fun of me for this but you know I don't
care I think it's cute this is a pretty
thick shirt like a over shirts you wear
as a jacket you can layer with it
whatever you wanted to do I also love to
add a detail of the extra fabric right
in here that you can
so pin in it just adds a little extra
layer to whatever outfit you're wearing
I have already worn it once and I really
like it a lot too next product again is
that green color this was on sale it was
originally one hundred sixty eight
dollars on sale for ninety nine ninety
five and I believe forty percent off of
that I'm pretty sure that's how it went
this what it looks like I love shirts
like this just to throw on with leggings
and I can wear this pretty much every
season
other than summer so I really like this
a lot love the color and its really
really comfy and very long so it covers
your butt if you're wearing leggings
this is the same top I'm wearing just in
this other color I swear I bought so
many colors of this this wasn't on sale
but again I just love the fit of it and
this is what it looks like I love the
bottom of it how it just goes in like
that I find it so flattering and you
might want to wear just like a bralette
or something underneath it I'm wearing a
bra underneath this one and you can't
really tell when you kind of can but
it's a bra you know who cares and then
two more things and I am done I promise
so this sweater is so soft and like a
little bit heavy it's a really great
material and I just really love the
details of this so this is the neckline
I know very cool right and it goes down
again cinches in at the waist which I
love it's so soft and thick again with a
batwing top which is my favorite I love
that wing tops I think they're just
awesome and this was not on sale again
I got it in size small but honestly when
you feel this it's that type of sweater
that's so soft and cozy you could
squeeze it and you're just like wanna
lay down on it it's amazing definitely
recommend this is so cute I mean I'm a
sweater kind of person in a hoodie
sweater I wear them all the time I have
a lot of Victoria Secret pink one that I
wear the crap out of and I need to toss
them because they're a little too little
too worn out this is something I could
wear around the house
and out with leggings or something it's
just beautiful so it just says 92 and I
love the color combo isn't that awesome
it just looks amazing I don't know what
92 is I don't care to that it doesn't
say 91 but yeah I love the color combo I
thought it was different I don't have
anything like this and again it's really
soft and a heavy material so it will be
fun to wear and it kind of has that open
neck kind of goes a little bit off the
shoulder if you want it to okay I
so that's everything I've picked up
recently and I hope you guys enjoyed it
