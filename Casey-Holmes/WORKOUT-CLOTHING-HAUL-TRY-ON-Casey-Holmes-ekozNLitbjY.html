sharing with you a huge fitness clothing
haul and nothing that gets me more
excited to work out the new workout
clothes and I'm really excited about
everything I found I went to Lululemon a
couple days ago and I ended up getting a
lot more than I thought I was gonna get
so I went in there and what I wanted to
get were some more leggings that have
the big pockets you'll see I got a pair
in this haul but it holds my 6 plus so
when I'm working out I don't have to
worry about setting it on the ground or
getting an armband or something it can
just sit in my pants I went on the
search for that and then I ended up
getting some sports bras because my
Victoria's Secret ones are really
starting to get dingy and just not
holding the girls like they should be
held so I figured I would just share
this with you guys I know a lot of
you've been wanting me to incorporate
more fitness stuff and I figured clothes
is fun for everyone everybody wants to
look cute when they go to the gym even
though realistically I usually wear like
a baggy t-shirt and leggings I'm now
starting to want to just a little bit
cuter because I just want it I want
something to look forward to when I wake
up in the morning something to put on so
I will be trying everything on for you
guys if you like these kinds of videos
don't forget to give it a thumbs up and
subscribe to my channel I have a link
down below and then roots here if you're
on a computer so yeah let's just get
started with all the stuff that I got
first thing like I said I did get new
sports bras and the first one I got is
actually one that I'm wearing a right
now
and it just looks like this is just a
blue sports bra and it kind of comes
down like a crop top you'll see when I
try it on but I really like it because
it has a gorgeous strappy detail in the
back and I've owned a Lululemon sports
bra before it was smaller than this it
didn't have like this area and I found
that it didn't hold the girls up as well
I'm actually a size 10 in the Lululemon
sports bras because otherwise it's like
I can't breathe like my boobs are
suffocating and it's just not cute so
I'm a size 10 a 36d androi secret bras
by the way if you kind of want like a
reference okay so I also got that sports
bra in this color and I thought I got it
I tried it on in black that's why I got
these other colors but I can't find it
so I need to check my receipt one more
time to make sure that I didn't get
charged for it but if not I'm going to
order the black one online but this is
what the other one looks like I love the
colors of it and love that it's mostly
black so there's the back of this one
it's just so cute I mean the fact that
these can like double as tops as well I
think is just really great so this very
leggings actually tried on a pair like
this at Lululemon like last year or
something and just it was one that had a
lot of mesh going up the side of the leg
I didn't end up buying it because I
wanted to purchase some other things but
I saw this again and I was like you know
what I want to get this pair so they're
like a pre style leggings and they're
just black and they have the wide
waistband and then they have this mesh
detail right here on your legs which i
think is really fun and cute and paired
with like a nice top I think is just so
fun and their leggings are really nice
as well they're nice and tight and they
also like don't show sweat which is huge
for me my Victoria's Secret leggings
would always shelves wet especially like
if I had sweat going down my back on my
butt area it's not cute it's a little
embarrassing when you can see all your
sweat so I like the fact that these and
Athleta Allah Athleta also has really
good leggings but to me they're more
like day to day around the house kind of
things I wear them to work out too but I
liked Lululemon a lot for working out
and like high-intensity stuff next
sports bra I got was this one and it's
really fun and just springg I don't have
anything like this as well it's just you
can't really tell because the lighting
but it's like a neon coral color and it
has this white mesh here in the front it
has a zipper this one's just like a
basic sports bra it doesn't come down
super super low but it does come down a
little bit lower and it just has some
nice straps in the back but you'll see
when I try all this stuff on next thing
I got was this top I love this top I
just think it's so adorable especially
like with the black strappy brawl that
I'm wearing right now this could add is
like a day-to-day top you know it
doesn't have to be a workout top please
just look like this it kind of like cap
sleeve
and it goes just all way down really
basic but the back is nice and open so
if you do have like some details in your
sports bra you'll be able to see them
really light and airy I love it I love
the fabric it's really soft and this one
is the sweat out tank it has a lot of
claims on it if you guys want to check
it out I would check out Lululemon's
website this is another top that I got I
got a couple this style just because I
like the way that it fit and I
personally like more loose tops I don't
really wear super tight tops
sometimes I do I have some from Athleta
that I really like that are kind of
tight but I like to be more comfortable
so more loose tops are my favorite and I
really like the way these fit and they
are really really flowy and airy and
just I feel like I could sweat a lot and
it's not going to like stick to my body
so this is just a basic black home with
some mesh here at the top and then the
back has a little opening as well and
these are great too because they do go
down and a high-low so it does kind of
cover your tush and all that good stuff
so I really like that and this one is
called the sculpt tank as well okay so I
got three of these like fun easy to wear
shorts have some like this from Nike but
they're like hot pink and stuff and
personally I don't wear super bright
colors anymore like hot pink pants or
hot pink shirts I want to go to the gym
I just don't really gravitate towards
them anymore I feel like it causes too
much tension so I like these these are
called the tracker shorts and I got
three of them and I really like the fact
that it has a lining on the inside as
well some people don't like this lining
but I do I feel like it's best to have
it so if you're doing some sort of leg
exercise this covers your underwear or I
guess if you want to it can be your
underwear you know people are going to
see up your shorts so I think that's a
plus
but they're really cute I like how thick
this band is right here it's very
comfortable they have little bitty
pockets so then I also got these same
exact shorts in this print I really like
this print I was kind of like
gravitating towards it it looks like
roses doesn't it look like roses in the
back just looks the same and then the
last pair of the tractor shorts that I
got are these
kind of purply look in one I like these
a lot I think these are the black top or
just so cute it's a fun pop of color
it's a pop of color but it's not like
neon you know I went through a phase
where all I wanted to wear was neon and
now I'm like I just like black and then
some kind of color some sort of pattern
so I got one more pair of shorts but
these are different these are they make
a move shorts and these actually have a
drawstring lace which I really like
these are a little bit shorter and they
have this adorable mesh lining around I
love these I think they are so stinking
cute and they're just so easy to wear
okay so I'm going to show you quickly
these tanks that I got I just got two
more the same style that the black one
was so this one again has the mesh at
the top and then I dig it in one more
style which is that kind of Rose
geometric pattern and I think this would
like black shorts would be so cute
and I like I really like the mesh here
at the top if you get adds something a
little bit extra I wouldn't wear these
with the matching shorts just because I
feel like that's a little too much
pattern but I like that I have solids
and patterns just to kind of mix them up
and have like a different outfit for
every week you know okay so this is the
last thing and this is what I went in
for ordered is these leggings now these
aren't the exact leggings that I was
specifically looking for the ones that I
like are the ones with the pocket but
they're high-rise
these aren't high-rise but they do have
a nice thick band which I love the thick
band is so comfortable and I really like
it but this is what it looks like these
pockets are amazing they just fit your
six-plus so well no need for a wristband
or armband anything like that and then
these are just the ones that go all the
way down to your feet
these have ruching I don't have any
leggings that I have the ruching on here
I tried it on and it didn't bother me so
I liked it and these are called the
Speed tight 5 ok guys so that is it for
this clothing haul I really hope you
enjoyed it I do actually have a spring

think I'm going to upload it right
