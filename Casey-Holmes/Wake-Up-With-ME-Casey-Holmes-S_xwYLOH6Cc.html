so at today's video you are going to be
waking up with me this is just an
average day in my little household so I
figured I would go ahead and show you
guys so I really hope you enjoy
first up I have to go to the bathroom
and always brush my teeth that's what we
should all do when we first get up right
and then I like to put on some music
just to kind of help me get up in the
morning and get pumped up and then I
have to clean up a little bit because I
tend to be a messy person so I leave
things out all the time so I just make
sure I clean up everything that'll lift
from the night before and then next is
making the bed which I really don't like
doing but I do it sometimes and then I'm
going to have to take my little babies
out so so then we just go outside for a
it potty break and then I'll come back
in and eat this morning I was not that
hungry so I just had a water and a
banana
next up is time take a shower and the
struggle of getting my towels is
literally too real because they're so
high up and have nowhere else to put
them so they end up falling down just
like that now for today I'll be using
the by Lodge by matrix shampoo
conditioner this is the hydrating one
and I love this one because it makes my
hair feel super soft so then I'll just
go ahead and brush out my hair and then
I will just put in my hair products and
below dry it per usual don't have a
exact way to blow-dry my hair I just
kind of throw it over hope that it gets
done as soon as possible
after I get done blow-drying my hair I
like to just kind of get lazy and lay
around and that's when I usually watch
some YouTube videos so today I was
actually watching me it's duty time like
the surprise it was so cute you guys
have got to check it out if you haven't
seen it and of course I do some
snapchats because I snapchat every
single morning then of course it's
cleanup time gonna clean up my mess
because I don't want to be dirty and
then next up is my makeup room I was
filming a lot of videos this week and my
makeup desk was horrible you guys was so
bad so that was the first thing I had to
do right when I walked in my makeup room
then it's time to edit videos I like to
go back and forth between editing and
commenting back to you guys
after that I'm going to go ahead and put
myself together and this day I just did
a really easy makeup look which is
basically focusing on my brows lashes
and my face and if you're wondering what
makeup products I use I will list them
down below in the description box
and the next step is my hair and I just
take my favorite straightener I've used
this for so long I think I have a coupon
code for it I'll leave it down below but
I just want to straighten my hair this
day so that's what I did and the next is
picking out the outfit and I ended up
wearing shorts so these jeans were
completely pointless but I just did a
really casual outfit because I had some
errands to run so this top is from
forever 21 and my shorts I believe are
from Marshalls I think they're like
Paris blues or something like that and
then I'm ready to just head out the door
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video
thank you so much for watching if you
guys are interested
balázs is doing a $2.00 off coupon if
you go and fill out the quiz below so
I'll have a link to that in the
description box and I hope you guys have
a great day and I'll see you in my next
video bye
