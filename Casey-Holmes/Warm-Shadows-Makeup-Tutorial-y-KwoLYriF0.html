sight if it don't hurt now just wait
just wait a while Jim let the big fish
in the pond no more hey guys so today's
video is going to be a tutorial on this
look and I recently got the it's G time
palette and I've had so many requests to
do a video with this palette ever since
they came out I just haven't gotten
around to purchasing it it's actually a
really affordable palette from BH
Cosmetics and as most of you know it's
Judi time day that pick the colors for
this palette and basically created the
whole thing so I'm all about supporting
two fellow youtubers and I figured I
would do a tutorial on this look now
this is the first time I've used this
palette and I'm obsessed with it like
the pigmentation is absolutely amazing
and the color selection is beautiful as
well you have the perfect amount of
matte and shimmer shades in this palette
but what I really like about it is it's
very versatile so like you have your
transition shade you have your matte
highlight which is perfect and then you
have a range of shimmer and matte shades
it's just an all-around great palette
definitely the best pigmentation for the
price of this palette that I have seen
ever so congratulations to her I know
this has been out for a while but this
is an amazing palette and I highly
recommend all of you checking it out if
you want me to do another tutorial on
this look I'll be more than happy to
already have another look in mind that I
want to do this so just like this video
if you want to see another tutorial with
it and I really hope you guys enjoy this
easy look and let's just go ahead and
get started
okay so I've already got my primers and
my tape on per usual and then I'm gonna
take this color right here it's the
perfect transition shade and I'm just
going to blend this into the crease I'm
sorry if I sound sick I'm actually very
soft up right now so just bear with me
through this video I know it sounds a
little nasally
I'm going to take this shade right here
and I'm going to place this all over the
first part of the lid and we're going to
stop about halfway this is just going to
help open up the eye so we put the
darker shade and the outer V it's not
going to close up the eyes
taking a shade right next to it I like
the fact that this one's shimmery so I
wanted the lid to stay pretty shimmery
for me I'm gonna place this color on the
outer half and you want to just make
sure you blend us in with the lighter
shade as well just so it blends it
seamlessly
we're gonna take this collar right here
and place this into the crease just so
we have something to help blend all
these colors up to the transition shade
and then also up to the brow bone so we
don't have any harsh lines in this look
then we're going to take this dark matte
Brown right here it's a gorgeous kind of
right brown and we're gonna place this
right in the outer V you don't want to
bring this in too far we just want to
add a little bit more depth there in the
outer V
so after you place that into the outer V
you just want to blend it out a little
bit and like I said these shadows blend
absolutely amazing so it wasn't hard to
blend this whatsoever
then it's time to take off the tape and
you get to see what your shadow looks
like and I love the way these shadows
look together they look so beautiful
moving out the face I'm gonna apply my
regular primers and I will have
everything listed down below in the
description box so we're just going to
kind of skip through this part because
you see we do it a ton of times and then
I'm applying my Chanel that Louie a
foundation and I'm going to apply this
all over my face with a Beauty Blender
this isn't the shade fifty and it
matches me perfectly what I'm not as
self tanned as I normally am
and then taking my regular concealers
I'm just going to apply this underneath
of my eyes and blend it out and then I
also put the concealer in the center of
my face just to highlight
taking the anastacio contour kit I'm
going to take the banana shade and set
all the concealer that I just blended
out
and then for bronzer I'll be using the
Bobbi Brown golden light bronzer with my
back kabuki brush
for contour using this new Becca bronzer
is a duo I'm going to use the darkest
shade in the palette just to contour my
face a little bit more
for blush I'm going to be using
damselfly by Becca and this is a
gorgeous peachy color and I'm just
applying this to my cheeks and then
blending it out for a highlight I'll be
taking the Dior amber light I think it's
called the highlight I haven't used this
in so long so I wanted to bust it out
today and I love it it is so so so
pretty
then I'm going to do my brows and I'm
using this Mack Brown fluid line and
deep dark brunette and I also forgot to
do eyeliner and lashes before I started
my face though I just used a brown gel
liner from Sigma if you want to see a
eyeliner and lashes tutorial I will
leave a down below for you guys I just
winged out my line or per usual and then
I'm taking this dark brown liner and
lining my waterline and then going back
to in the first shade that we use I'm
going to follow kind of the pattern that
we did on our lid and put the lightest
shade and then beginning part of the eye
so right there knee as a tear duct and
then I'm going to take the darker shade
right here and place this in the outer
half of the lower lash line and then all
you're going to do is just blend those
two together so that way they'll both
kind of go along with you lid
then we're gonna highlight with a cream
shade of the pallet this is a really
pretty highlight shade and I'm happy
that she put a matte one in here
so it can go along with a bunch of
different looks but I'm just going to
highlight with that and then we're ready
to move on to lips so I'm taking Mac's
world lip liner and just aligning my
lips with this just to add a lot of
definition because you guys know I love
fuller lips
and then taking freckle talent buy back
this goes along perfectly with the
cheeks and the eyes it's just a nice
peachy nude so I'm gonna apply that all
over and then take peach stock buy back
again and apply this over top and then
you are good to go I really hope you
guys enjoyed this video if you did
please give it a thumbs up and I will
see you all in my next video
then you don't easy but just get it
sight if it don't hurt now just wait
just wait a while not the big fish I
gotta keep myself in check sometimes I
tend to dream will bake some</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
