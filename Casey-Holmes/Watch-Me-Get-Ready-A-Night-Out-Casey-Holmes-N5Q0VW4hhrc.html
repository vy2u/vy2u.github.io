we're just bored out of our mind and
waiting for one friend to Texas ask us
if we want to go out so today I'm gonna
be showing you guys how I got ready for
a night out and I really hope you enjoy
it as long as skies
yeah act so innocent now so first off
you guys know I'm obsessed with music I
have to listen to it all the time so I'm
going to take my bathroom and just set
that up
and what I use for my shower today I
just used this bottle of shampoo my
macadamia to prepare mask and also
shaved my legs with the skintimate stuff
and afterwards I put on deodorant and
then for skincare
I took my Mac prep and prime and put
that all over my face and then I use my
Bobbi Brown hydrating eye cream and then
moving on to my favorite moisturizer at
the moment this is a L'Oreal Biotherm
moisturizer this is so great especially
if you have oily skin it hydrates about
five layers deep for a long lasting
moisture and also it's basically like a
gel so it sinks in really quickly and it
contains no parabens or mineral oils and
it tracks in the moisture so your skin
stays hydrated so I love this you guys
I'm not kidding you need to check it out
especially if you have oily skin amazing
I'll leave a link for it down below if
you want to check it out and then I'm
going to take my regular hair products
these are the hair products I've been
using recently so if you want to know
what they are in detail I will leave
them down below I've had a lot of
questions on what I've been using so
I'll make sure to put that in the
description box for you guys
Oh
my god
so after I'm done blow-drying my hair
it's time to go ahead and go into the
makeup room but first I had to heat up
some leftovers because I was hungry so
I'm just gonna bring my food and water
with me but first I have to start some
music because I just always have to have
music going you guys I'm a music person
I love it much more than TV so I'm
always always listening to music and so
I just sat down and decided to go ahead
and eat some my food sing to my puppies
answer some phone calls before I started
getting ready
moving on to makeup I'm going to take
this Sigma pilot and we're going to
start with this shade right here and
blend this all into the crease and I'm
going to show you guys what my go to
going outlook has been it's just been
one eye favorite so easy to do and I've
been really really loving it this is
also the makeup look that I had in my
last video as well if you're wondering
if I'm going to take the shade right
here it's like a red orange with some
shimmer and I'm going to apply this all
over my lid you guys know I love my red
and orange eyeshadows so I couldn't pass
this one up
then I'm going to take this really warm
mustard color and I'm going to put this
directly in the crease this is going to
help blend out that red shade and fade
it up towards the brow bone even more
good I'm going to take this shimmery
purple shade and I'm going to put this
in the outer V just very lightly
blending this in I'm not going to take
it in too far I just want to really
deepen up this look I know the color
combos seem really weird but for some
reason they just work together so I
really really love all of these colors
combined and then I'm going to take the
brush I used for the crease color and
I'm going to just blend blend and blend
taking my new favorite primer this is a
Smashbox pore minimizing primer and I
can't put this thing down you guys is so
good and then taking my favorite
foundation of the moment by ex1 and 300
and 400 and then of course I will be
doing my concealer and I'll be using the
Mac Pro Longwear concealer and mixing
two different shades as well
taking my uh associate control kit in
the banana shade I'm going to set my
concealer per usual
then it's time to bronze up the skin I'm
taking my mac mineralize bronzer in give
me Sun and I'm just going to put this on
my forehead cheeks and on my neck
contour amusing hoola by benefit and my
Norris eat a brush feel the magic
going in when will my favorite blushes
from Mac this is cantaloupe is Oh
beautiful I mentioned it before and if I
was a blush this would be my blush so I
loved it so much and put that on my
cheeks I know it looks heavy but don't
worry we're gonna blend it out
like a brain then we're going to take a
bobby brown sugar brick in beige and
just highlight on the top of our
cheekbones with this so I'm going to
head into brows and now I'm moving on to
this is Judy time palette taking the
matte cream shade you can use whatever
cream shade you have I'm just going to
highlight right underneath my brow then
I'm taking this Sigma eyeliner I forget
the name but I'll leave it down below
it's just a nice brown eyeliner and I'm
not doing a winged liner or anything
like that I haven't been doing one the
past few days so I'm not going to do one
for this video and I just love the way
it looks a lot more that's why I have my
eye shadow angled up more so I don't
have to have a winged liner and my eyes
still look like they're up and awake
then I'm taking this Mac coaster reach
eyeliner and oh my gosh if you have
brown eyes honey you need this liner in
your life it will just make them pop and
then I'm going to put on my lashes these
are the lower lashes and it grow you
crazy you guys know it's my favorite and
then mix in those two shades I'm going
to put this underneath my lower lash
line and I'm really smoking this out I'm
not afraid to drag the color down pretty
far because I want to look as smoky as
possible I love the way this looks it
just looks so nice at first you're kind
of nervous because it looks really
really crazy but once you put mascara on
everything comes together so just keep
on blending and then put your mascara on
and it looks so good
I love this makeup look for my eyes it
just makes them pop now to the lip combo
I've been doing recently I've had so
many questions on my Instagram and
everything like that in my last video
and you've been wondering what I've been
using so first off i line my lips with
my mac lip liner in well and I also fill
them in
and now I'm taking this Gerard cosmetics
lipstick in nude and I'm just going to
go ahead and top that over well and then
I'm going in with slark Pro matte crayon
amazing amazing product I think this is
the rose one I can't remember but I'll
leave it down below I'm just going to
lightly fill in my lips a little bit
more with this and it kind of gives it
that Kylie Jenner look so this is the
completed look I absolutely love it and
I hope you love it as much as I do
see I can't be serious all the time now
for my hair I just wanted to straighten
it I didn't want to do anything too
crazy with it because I really wasn't in
the mood so I just went ahead and put my
straightener through it
and then after that we are done with
hair and makeup and time to move on to
outfit so my outfit is really casual but
a little bit more badass see my jacket
is from Zara my top is also from Zara my
leggings are from BCBG and my shoes are
from bebe so I really hope you guys like
