Christmas is so packed like that day I
have to go to a lot of different houses
um but so packed that I could never like
film it edit it that day so sometimes I
just forget and I'm like oh we'll do it
next year and this year I figured I
would finally sit down and do it even
though it's not on Christmas Day it's a
couple days after but it's still kind of
like Christmas right oh yeah asked you
guys on Twitter a couple times if you
did want to see it and you guys said yes
of course and it's not a bragging video
whatsoever this is basically like a haul
but I didn't buy any of this stuff so I
did get quite a bit of home decor stuff
and things like that because I did ask
for it and some of the stuff I didn't
even ask for and I really loved so I
can't wait to share it with you guys and
yeah let's just get started with this
Christmas video and it's not even

Paws got you beds and toys didn't need
so my sister got me this adorable
hummingbird feeder and has auburn on it
if you follow me you know I love a burn
but I thought this was adorable it's
going to go great on my front patio I
just have to figure out like how to put
it all in here so mix four parts of
water mill Parcher and boil it I can't
wait I love seeing hummingbirds and I
think this will be so adorable so thank
you mache I love it it's so cute okay
and when I went to Davis's house or
Christmas Eve they did get like little
gifts out so his grandma was too

gift car which it's just being my

getting ready and this is just oh so
soft I wish you guys could feel it I
also got this from Dave his mom and we
really like home decor and just like try
to find cute things for the house and
things like that that's one thing we
really like connect with but you got me
these adorable lantern things that
put by my fireplace and put like fake
candles in there's actually like
electric panels that are have timers on
it and stuff so that they can flame up
at a certain time like at night or
whatever and then they'll turn off which
I think would be so cute but I love
these we're going to see what they look
like by my fireplace and if I like
something a little bit different ready
to exchange them for something else she
said we would go and find some other
ones if it didn't fit the theme of my
living room and I think it's going to
fit really well because it's kind of
like a silver theme and like woodsy I'm
doing like an outdoor woodsy silver
theme in my living room if that makes
any sense I know it sounds weird but
that's kind of what I'm going for
so she got me two of these to go next to
the fireplace and I love them I think
they are beautiful
she got a mentor called at home and she
showed me some other pictures of stuff
that is there and I have to go there
more often because it's they have such
cute things the other one is actually
still wrapped up after this video I'm
going to put them by the fireplace and
soup they look like and then I got this
really cool cactus I'm like obsessed
with and cactuses aren't a lot of work
so that's perfect for me because I
always kill plants
I bought firms over the summer and I
killed all them so just for my Uncle
John and aunt Toni from my mom's side
and it's a Zygo cactus and it says that
it rebloom z-- each holiday season this
season care for plant is perfect gift
that everyone can appreciate so I love
that I love that it blooms every holiday
so I just thought it was cute and I
can't like too but this I'm not
confident in my dining room because I
need kind of some greenery in there okay
and since I was surprised with like I
was surprised I did not know I was
getting it but it's so useful I started
laughing because my stepdad likes to
come over and do my yard work he'll just
come here randomly do it
um but he got me this and I was like
this is use it for me but ever since I
got my dad I've had to sweep off the
leaves and so because the ton of leaves
and like pine straw get on it and
especially like during the spring and
fall like it just say yourself fall into
the pool so he got me this leaf blower
so I would have to sweep it anymore
because it took some time probably
something like 30 must sweep my whole
deck and like get who I want it so he
got me this leaf blower
and I like it because it doesn't have
like the crank or whatever you call it
and you can just plug it in and it's a
really easy and useful leaf blower and I
cannot wait what comes to the bag - cool
oh that's awesome so yeah I like this
because it's easy just press a button
and you can blow off the deck or
anything and I'm just rose you look so
cute roses in her dog pen and she's
loving it yeah I love this though Thank
You Ricky that was an awesome gift and I
didn't even think about getting leaf
blower to help make sleeping much easier
but it's totally going to help I cannot
wait and then another gift that I got
which they're actually in the dishwasher
is a set of glasses with my initials on
them like CLA they're from of my uncle
Billy and aunt Tammy and I love them
because they're the cutest shaped glass
I'll try to insert a picture in here but
I absolutely adore them because I got
him as a housewarming gift I was like I
need more and I got me some more so I'm
so happy with them thank you guys so
much and last but not least is this
present which is so big so let me just
Pan you over there let's see if we could
do this he's probably not gonna fit in
the frame there is okay so this present
is from David this is my giant teddy
bear we actually blog on Monday I have a
bunch of blogs I have to edit and get up
but I saw this and I was like oh my god
I love it I want it that's just dying
over in Kroger so I had no idea who's
gonna get it for me I didn't even ask
for it but he knew I loved it so he got
it for me and he is huge y'all he's dry
harvest and he is the best little bear
ever he probably weighs like 30 to 40
