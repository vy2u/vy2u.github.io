what's in my makeup bag video I saw one
of my friends um
virtual girl makeup I think that's her
username I will link her stuff right
here for you guys but I really love her
videos and she actually did one of these
and I was like I want to do what this is
it it's just a Michael Kors little
makeup bag that I got for Christmas from
my fiance and I really like it holds
quite a bit of stuff and I just think
it's really cute and I love Michael Kors
and it has like a little tassel right
here and of course it has the logo right
there as well so okay I'm just gonna
pull from the top up so the first thing
is these Revlon eyelash curlers I love
to keep eyelash curlers on the go my
eyelash is kind of drooped down a little
bit because of mascara so I like to kind
of curl them back up during the day I
have and I guess it's like a basic
shadow brushes from Sonia Kashuk though
I like just to keep this one in my part
I don't really want to keep my Sedona
lace brushes in my makeup bag because I
really like those brushes I kind of go
for the more drugstore ones to keep in
my makeup bag just in case if anything
were to happen to them it's okay the
next thing I have is an elf kabuki brush
I use this thing so much I think it's
just so amazing I highly recommend this
kabuki brush if you're in the market for
a new one the next thing is this L'Oreal
voluminous carbon black mascara I've
been using this up lately
this isn't like my all-time favorite
mascara definitely not but I'm trying to
use it up I'm trying to go through my
mascaras I'm not buying any more and
just trying to use everything kind of up
so I can go buy a bunch of new makeup
but I'm using this up and I actually
kind of like it is really black but it's
just I don't know it's not my favorite
next is basically the eyeshadow I have
on today and it's my rock and Republic
eyes shadow and wrath I don't have some
focus because it's a mirror but it's a
really pretty shadow I love rock
Republic's eyeshadows and all that stuff
I actually purchased mine from ho look
calm I mean I did it a while back too
and I've just been recently getting back
into my rock my palette stuck
if you're interested in like looking at
Outlook and all the other stuff I will
put their link down below I actually
ordered some stuff from benefit you'll
see it soon but I'll keep the link down
below I also got this powder from there
which is in here I've been using this a
lot more lately since I'm more tan and
stuff like that I wasn't really able to
use it during the winners and all that
but it's just my powder it's in I don't
think it's just in Kashmir and it just
looks like this definitely one of my
favourite powders right now so glad I
get to use that up paste filling next is
this Sonia Kashuk quad and hidden agenda
the main reason why I use this is just
for the green concealer but the other
ones are really nice as well
and then I don't know if you guys know
there's like a little transparent or
translucent powder right there that you
can set your concealer with next is just
like the blush of the day and this
change is so often a lot of these things
change often because it's just what my
makeup bag like what I'm wearing for the
day or something this is max dolly mix
definitely one of my favorite blushes
ever I like okay I have the one by one
for Maybelline I do love this a ton one
of my favorite drugstore mascaras ever I
have another Sonia Kashuk brush this is
why I just use for the blush that I have
in my bag I use it for my Mac blush um I
also have this little ole a two-in-one
daily facial cloth it's like the little
sample size I have this in here and then
I have this last thing oh no it's not
there's no lipstick but I have my cover
talks 10 powder in here from Physicians
Formula I just like to keep this I don't
know why this is definitely my favorite
powder for the drugstore I highly highly
highly recommend it so and then the last
thing is my ultimate favorite lipstick I
just I'm gonna be so sad when I run out
of this but it's innocents beware from
Mac I don't even want to swatch it for
you because I love it so much
I have a feeling that I'm gonna have to
go and spend like $30 to get another
lipstick like that just because I'm
obsessed
with its but yeah so that was what was
in my makeup bag I hope you guys enjoyed
it it's pretty simple video but I just
love seeing what's in other people's
makeup bags and I will see you all in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
