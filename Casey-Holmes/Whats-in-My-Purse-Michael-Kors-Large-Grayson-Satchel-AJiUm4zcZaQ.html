a what's in my purse video and I've had
a ton requests for this ever since I got
my new bag in November and I've been
obsessed with it and I just kind of
really busy and haven't had a chance to
clean out my bag so I figured why not do
it on camera so this is my bag it is me
Michael Kors large Grayson satchel
did you believe it is the black one of
course well I love it it's freaking a
ginormous and it holds a bunch of crap
so let's just get right into it first
thing is of course I have my cell phone
in here just the iPhone 4s and my case
is super cute it says cocktail anywhere
it's from Kate Spade I do believe I got
it from Marshalls for like fifteen or
twenty dollars so let that phone case
then it keeps it really nice to protect
it too next I have my little wallet this
is from a little black bag I show this
in my last what's in my bag video on
last summer and it's still holding up
very well it's from the brand deluxe or
whatever I always say it wrong so I
always correct nipple it's all my stuff
and II it's a hold and it's just perfect
so I absolutely love this wallet
and also if I'm like in a rush I could
put my phone in here and zip it up and
just go out the door so it's kind of a
little clutch as well love it
so see you next I have a receipt from
Sally's and it looks like I bought a
hair dye and one two three four five six
seven seven China Glaze nail polishes
ridiculous so fun bunch of crafts at
Sally's as usual I have a gum wrapper
birth control because ain't no tape is
gonna be around me anytime soon
I have this Express coupon didn't have
this body spray from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
this is the very flirt and I love this
one it smells so good the only thing
that sucks is its top always comes off
and never stay on get some winners I
have my maybelline instant age rewind
not just though then of course I have my
checkbook register the EOS lip-balm at
Cameron Burt which this one was but
smells really good last time
it's my favorite Els bomb and let's see
I have these headphones these are the
brain retract and I love these I sold
them at Walmart they're like five
dollars apiece so about a couple they
just basically like retract back into
this little thingy so you can open them
up really wide and then just like pull
the thingy and they'll go right back in
there and I love this thing and I have
this little bag this is like a bag that
if C stand out at one month I don't know
but I do like this for change and petty
cash and all that so I just keep things
like that in here let's see I have my
Paris or more lotion this smells so good
and then I have this big brush from
Ecotools I like to use this with the
powder throughout the day it's just
super soft and really nice let's see you
then I have to my keys I have a brush

crazy
I had my makeup bag this is from forever
21 and I absolutely love it because it's
so bright there's have a couple things
in here nothing too much I also have max
creme de nude lipstick in here ah
for some reason I never close my makeup
bag so everything just falls right back
out so it's just a big mess in general
let's see I have a receipt from Macy's
when I went to Mac so that's just in
there I also have another little receipt
thing this is from Rory Wilin and this
is when we were going to Supercross one
weekend they had the Honda riders come
out to a place called free one and
they were signing autographs and stuff
so I bought a couple boards for the
dudes to autograph and then I have this
phone charger and I got this from
Walgreens and they have this in a budget
in her color so I just I love the
colorful things and yeah I just keep
this in my purse cuz netball always dies

Mac trim to new lipstick let's see and
then we have the thing that comes in
your Michael Kors bag that tells you
what your bag is made of forever and
then we have the Nivea and milk and
honey this is amazing lip balm if your
lips are just overly chapped this will
save your life then I have whiskey a
