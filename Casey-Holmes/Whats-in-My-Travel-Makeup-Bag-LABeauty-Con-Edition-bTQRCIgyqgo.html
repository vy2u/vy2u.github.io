a what's in my travel makeup bag I have
my makeup bags over here ready to go and
to show you guys when I packed in them
for LA I did just get back from LA
yesterday and I have to say I'm gonna do
a little recap real quick it was so much
fun the meaning all of you guys I meant
so many subscribers up there it was
insane
thank you so much for coming up to me
and I had a great time taking pictures
with all of you it literally like warmed
my heart I was just oh I was overwhelmed
I felt so amazing I just felt all the
love in that place it was so so great so
thank you so much you all were gorgeous
and I do have a blog I'm going to be
posting about beautycon so if we did
take a picture feel free to tag me and
stuff in it on Instagram Twitter or
Facebook I'll leave all my links down
below and details on how you can tag me
on there because I would love to see
them I also want to quickly show you
guys my shirt
this is a shirt it says I am that girls
out of this shirt is actually from an
organization that I met at beautycon
I've saw these shirts and I was like oh
that's cute just as iron that girl which
I just thought it was really cute but
then I went up to her and I asked her
you know what I was about and whenever
she told me what it was I was like okay
I have to buy this because I think it's
such a great organization and just
really really quickly you can fast
forward if you want but I want to tell
you what it means to be that girl I know
what this organization is basically
about so it says being that girl is an
identity a responsibility and an
opportunity for us to stand up for
something bigger than ourselves and to
lift each other up being that girl means
that we recognize our work and that were
perfectly flawed and sublimely beautiful
every time you look in the mirror we are
reminded that we are the author of our
own lives and that we believe in the
power of our dreams feel gorgeous inside
and out and reinvent ourselves into
whoever we choose to be
while we're certainly out to change the
world we must start first with ourselves
so join our mission rough this world and
be that girl I just thought it was super
cute I loved what they were about and I
was like uh imma buy that shirt it was
like $15
it's just going to a great cause so I'll
leave that link down below I just
thought was really great I wanted to
mention it in this video and I think in
your hair from Bellamy I love my Bellamy
crew they are amazing and I had so much
fun meeting them as well so yeah I love
you Bellamy okay so moving on to the
makeup bag I did take my benefit one I
actually got this from Sephora last year
I think it was like a little free gift
that I got I don't remember exactly how
I got it but I know it was from Sephora
and it just did like stay don't stray on
the top and it's really huge
another bag I took was this one from
Sephora as well and this one like came
out not too long ago they were given
like free stuff away with it with the V
IVs and stuff have this and then I also
have my Sigma brush case so quickly I'm
going to show you the makeup first
because there's a good bit in here
because this whole a lot I wanted to
over pack instead of under pack because
I didn't wanna have to buy anything when
I was out there honestly so I did pack a
lot of stuff and the first thing I did
take was my Urban Decay b6 spray and I
put it in this little travel bottle only
took like a little bit with me but I
like the way this feels on my skin I
don't necessarily see any difference
really to be honest with you but I do
like to spray this on my skin because
it's so refreshing and it makes my skin
feel really nice and I just don't know I
really like it and has good benefits in
it so took that along with me in a
little travel bottle now this is what
the inside of the you makeup bag looks
like woah God darn half my books in my
hand I did take my Mac Paint Pot in soft
ochre to prime my eyes I almost forgot
this so I'm happy I remembered and
picked it back up in my makeup
collection but I think we're gonna get a
new one soon because this one's kind of
drying out on me but it's my favorite
primer ever and I'm not going in any
order I'm just gonna pick grab show you
guys so I can just put all this stuff
away so up top we do have my Tarte
eyelash curler how
that on hand first I have some lip
glosses we have the mac viva glam Nikki
lip gloss mac prolongwear lip gloss and
impatience please it was just the one
that I were always get took my lip liner
by Stila it's inspiring also took my Mac
prep and prime in radiant Rose which I
never used this but I took it just in
case I wanted to also to my L'Oreal
shocking extensions and waterproof and I
use this because my wife's l can kind of
smudge underneath my eyes if I'm not
careful so I'm going to prevent that
completely which I didn't even use this
a my YSL mascara didn't smudge on me at
all throughout the weekend so it's kind
of pointless for you to take it so long
and I also brought my Rimmel scandaleyes
I'm Larry nude swear by this stuff I
rarely ever use black on my waterline
anymore just because I feel like the
nude really opens up my eyes and makes
me look more awake and I just like it so
much better and this is by far my
favorite one ever and then I also took
my Jordana fabula nur
in black favorite liquid eyeliner at the
moment
moving on to foundation the one I relied
on this weekend is my hourglass
masculine liquid powder foundation it's
mattifying and oil-free so I took this
along with me I love to this foundation
is stay put all day looked amazing and I
really do like it you have to be careful
with this foundation because if you mess
with it too much you can start breaking
the foundation up when you're applying
it on your skin so you want to be
careful with how you apply it I just use
the Sigma F the flat top kabuki the f80
I think I've used that with this and I
love it I have the color light beige
which can be a little light for me when
I'm self-tanning but with a darker
powder it works is my Vaseline a cocoa
butter lip therapy just to moisturize my
lips and my mac prolongwear concealer
Zin NC 20 and NC 30 brought these along
with me because I absolutely adore these
concealers I think they're hands-down
the best ones ever able to take my Mac
prep and prime skin reminds own
treatment and/or skin refined his own
treatment
I really like this stuff I think a lot
of you told me to buy this because it's
great for oily skin and it really if it
kept me matte as well throughout the day
this with this foundation and the
Porefessional was just amazing okay for
another lipstick I did take my Mac not
Mac urban decay lipstick and natan which
is just a really pretty pink color and
then took my favorite lipstick of a
month right now this is max hue I wore
this when I was at beautycon as well I
was gonna wear red lips at some point
but it didn't end up going so I brought
on my red lipstick stuff for nothing but
I did bring my Maybelline lipliner in 50
radishes a gorgeous red lip liner I also
took my Sigma eyeliner in boost my brow
mousse from tweezerman love this stuff
another Urban Decay lipstick this one's
in naked too it's just a nude color and
my why I sell babydoll lipstick that I
swear I because it's amazing and it's
the only mess Hira I use I do have my
stealer I shadow and kitchen I wore this
all beautycon as well because I'm
obsessed with it and I have a brush in
here too the Mac 212 brushes in here I
also took a lash card with me I didn't
end up using it but I brought it just in
case because I kept my eyeshadow really
really simple at beautycon I didn't want
to go too overboard with it and let's
see going on to face products which is
my personal favorite so first thing I
took was my Mac prep and prime
transparent powder and this is what it
looks like and I actually didn't use
this much to be quite honest with you
what I thought I was going to use it
more than I actually did I also took my
Mac bronzer and give me son I didn't use
this either but I did bring it just in
case because you never know if you want
to switch it out actually have a new
bronzer that I ended up using but you
guys know Irene using this so much of my
videos for the past like two months
three months maybe and I just I love it
so I had to take it with me also took
along my NYX said it don't fret powder
because
as my makeup for everyone is almost done
and I didn't want to take it because
they honestly don't want to use it up
but this is a great dupe for it the NYX
said it don't fret it it's the matte
finishing powder and it's just a loose
powder it's in light/medium this is the
bronzer that I use it's the Bobbi Brown
bronzer and golden light and did
exchange that darker when I had in my
Sephora haul if you haven't seen that ha
I will link it is it right here right
here
I like it for you right here but that's
what it looks like it looks like a
really light bronzer but it looks
amazing on your skin I love it and I
haven't bought a new bronzer and so on
so this one's getting a lot of love
right now moving on to the luscious I
brought three I did take max blush in
right for love this was from the
temperature rising collection also
brought to my Mac Melba blush I don't
remember which want to use I think I
used Alpine bronze but I did bring this
one along as well and Mac's alpine
bronze which I do believe I used at
Beauty color for beauty cons so I love
this it's just a pretty bronze color now
to contour my face even more I did take
my hoola benefit bronzer and he did use
this as well so great bronzer to contour
with I know whenever I saw these in
store a long time ago of people showing
them on YouTube I was like that is never
one to show up on my skin but honestly
it's just like the Bobbi Brown bronzer
they look really light but once you put
them on your skin it's like instant
shadow I mean it's really dark so if
you're kind of debating on this going so
far and have them put it on your skin
and you could totally see what I'm
talking about it's insane so I love this
bronzer amazing to contour with the
other thing I brought oh here it is my
little mini benefit Porefessional primer
got that in the Sephora bag also took my
Mac probably conceal palette like this
because I love this thing I've been
using it for months as well and I can't
get enough of it and then to help the
hourglass foundation match my skin
because I was self-tanning I used the
benefit hello flawless powder
this isn't toasted beige and this really
helped my
smacked my neck a lot more because the
hourglass one is pretty light so this
one really helped you know match it and
it looks really great as well it didn't
look powdery at all are too cakey it
just it looked amazing so I really
really liked this powder and then I was
bringing my Anastasia brow Wiz pencil
but I forgot it somehow I think it just
like fell on my floor and I was packing
and I didn't even realize it but luckily
I packed this because I was thinking at
the time you know if I didn't want to
use my anastacio I could use this so
it's like oh my god thank the Lord I
don't have to put this in the bag
so if the brow bar to go from whitening
lightning I love this
currently I am using the Anastasia
because I'm currently obsessed but this
is a great one I'm using for a long time
and you know this is what I used for my
brows I also took my Naked basics
palette which is what I used for my eye
shadow as well it's just a really great
neutral palette great for if you don't
want to do super dramatic looks I mean
you could if you wanted to and then I oh
I have another lipstick in here and this
is Oh RiRi woo by Mac this is what I was
going to use if I wore my red lips but I
didn't I'm not wearing red lips so kind
of sad the last thing I have in here
which I didn't use either but is my Mac
palette I specifically wanted it for
soft brown moving off to the brushes I
took in my Sigma case these are my
standard brushes like I use them for
everything every single day these are my
go-to brushes and the first one I took
which is a new favorite I bought this a
couple weeks ago and I have been
constantly using it it's the Real
Techniques brush brush brush from
Samantha Chapman got it right that time
and I love it it's the contour brush
it's perfect to contour with I love to
bronze and then go in with this and just
sharpen out the contour more and I love
this it's so so good oh by the way Real
Techniques is at my Walmart I don't know
if they're doing that at every Walmart
but I saw it and I was like buying stuff
like crazy because I was so
I did so definitely check out your
Walmart if you're looking for more real
technique brushes then I also took my
Mac 130 this is the best stippling brush
I have ever used in my life also brought
along 3 e 25 brushes which is great
blending brushes and you can use these
for almost anything really took my Sigma
tapered blending which is a really nice
tapered blending brush from Sigma pencil
brush the e30 my Mac 242 which was what
I used for my Sela shadow my revlon
all-over shadow brush my Sigma flat
definer a 15 my said only 850 blush
brush which is one of my faves my Real
Techniques expert face brush that I love
also took my tarts brow brush which I -
spoolie on the end and the little brush
last but not least is the brushes in my
Sephora case and these are the bigger
brushes that would not fit in a sigma
one so I did all my Beauty Blender a
Beauty Blender is in here and I also
took my Sigma by kooky f80 which is
super dirty now but I used this for that
hourglass foundation also the real
technique powder brush because my Sigma
one that came with my mr. bunny set has
gone missing I honestly don't know where
it went it literally walked away but
this has been my powder brush now lately
so I love that brought this Ecotools
little brush as well and then took my
favorite bronzer brush this is the Mac
134 I love this brush seriously it's a
god-sent for me I absolutely love it so
that was on the makeup impressions I
took with me to LA and I hope you guys
