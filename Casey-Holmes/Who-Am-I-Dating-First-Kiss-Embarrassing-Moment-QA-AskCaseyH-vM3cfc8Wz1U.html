an updated Q&amp;amp;A I asked you guys on
Twitter and Instagram to ask me some
questions and I got a ton of questions
especially on Instagram so thank you
guys so much for participating I asked
you guys for more like weird fun
questions because they're a lot more fun
I mean beauty is fun too I might answer
a couple of those but let's be real
let's just have some fun for this video
right I think q and A's are a lot more
fun when they have interesting questions
so I actually screenshot a lot and we're
just gonna go through them and this is
one from Nicole and she said not to be
funny how are you enjoying the single
life and what do you miss most about
being in a relationship this has been
such a common question from you guys and
you guys been asking me huh dealt with a
breakup for me I'm very independent I
know what I want I know how to have fun
and the first thing I wanted to do when
I got our relationship was go out with
girlfriends and have a fun time so I'm
enjoying the single life I'm having the
time of my life right now I was in a
relationship for four years and I'm
still from 18 to 22 I'm out to be 23 and
I'm I don't know I'm kind of feeling
like I'm getting out and enjoying the
nightlife and enjoying things I haven't
been able to not just because of him or
anything
I just haven't be able to enjoy the
single young life feels so good to be
back into my own skin and feeling good
and looking good and just being happy
and just going out and meeting new
people and enjoying my life and what do
I miss most about being the relationship
or in a relationship definitely somebody
putting IKEA furniture together because
succs
Peyton Towers said if you could turn
into a vegetable for one day what
vegetable would you be and I would be a
green pepper because I love green
peppers I love them raw I love them
cooked green peppers are my thing so
Tess longstead what's one thing you love
about yourself and that is definitely my
ability to have fun like even by myself
I have such a blast the other day I was
cleaning my house before Amanda came
down and I put on like 90s Spice Girls
and s club 7
and a high pony and I was like giving it
and it was just I don't know I can have
fun by myself and with other people
I am Tooting my own horn Jordan
Kennedy's that would you rather be
chased by an elephant sized spider or a
swarm of normal spiders I say the
elephant because hopefully I could hide
somewhere the small ones would be oh my
oh no yeah elephant sized Ashley cram
pass do you think you'll ever adopt
another puppy or your preference is so
cute and lucky and thank you and I
actually plan on purchasing a house
within the next year I want to renew my
least one more year and then I get a
house and when I do it's been how a
fenced-in yard and everything like that
so my max for dogs I want four so I want
two more so probably rescue two more
whenever I get a house and get settled
in just so my babies have people to play
with
I have always grown up with a lot of
dogs like when I was younger we had
eight dogs at one point and then two of
those had babies so we had tons of dogs
running around I just love having a big
dog family I'm a huge dog person but
living in an apartment right now
I think having more than two is just too
much they need a place to run and have
fun so when I get a house I will get two
more Shelby Gregory asks what's your
favorite alcoholic drink you will not
find me at the bar without a margarita
in hand that's like a my drink I go to
the bar margarita in Iran go I want a
margarita it's just my favorite drink
and it's a drink that I feel comfortable
with because I know my limits with it so
margaritas for the win Rebecca asked
something you preach to us but don't
always practice this oh this this was
obvious for me washing your face at
night especially if I go out I have such
a hard time going home and washing my
face I'm like no what a little Brittany
asked if you could go back in time what
would you tell your younger self and
that would be don't rush into things and
you'll be okay
Lilly Mason asked if you came with a
warning label what would it be
and I got this question in my friend
trainer was beside me and I was like
what would your answer that be and she
said leave your feelings at the door and
the reason why she said that is because
I'm very blunt and very
honest I don't hold a lot of things back
when I'm talking to people sometimes if
somebody's talking to me about issues I
will be very blunt and honest and how I
think they should handle it like an
unbiased opinion about it and you know
sometimes people you know they get
offended by it but honestly if you ask
me for my opinion and will let you know
the honest answer and I don't know it's
just like some things that come out of
my mouth is like where the hell is the
filter I ask my mom all the time she
doesn't have a filter either I'm like
what did you do to me I have no filter
Felicia asked would you rather stop
working out for a year or stop shopping
for clothes for an entire year stop
shopping for clothes because if you guys
assume my apartment or in my closet I
don't need any more okay okay we're
going to Instagram now this is from ban
Bonin it says kill marry shag Alfie
deyes I think his high stays I'll say
I'm sorry Caspar Lee and jack harries is
it Harry's or Harris I don't know okay
so kill I would kill Alfie because
that's though as man I wouldn't want to
marry him or shag him so sorry Alfie I
love Zoe I would I would shag Caspar Lee
and marry Jack because Jack is so fine
he is so gorgeous I've always had like a
little crush for Jack so you know let
him know I'm one where you just tweet to
Jack and say hey you should marry Casey
home see even seven nine seven I asked
if you go on a date and you know in the
first 10 minutes that you're not
interested how you do how do you handle
that situation okay so like I've told
you guys I'm very blunt and I would read
like a lot of my emotions you can see it
in my face like it's just it's hard for
me to hide my feelings I probably say
honestly I'm kind of ready go I just not
feeling it I don't feel good faith Bella
91 ask if a guy cheats do you believe in
second chances or do you believe the
saying once a cheater always a cheater
once a cheater always a cheater honey
first kiss oh my god how can I forget
this one oh my god so bad though it was
in like seventh grade and we all went to
the movies and like everybody was making

embarrassing a moment okay so we were at
this club called vanquish in Atlanta

never been to a club before this is my
first time this was like a couple months
ago and you know I had a little bit to
drink I don't know what happened my
friend was leaving and I was I was right
behind her and I'm like oh I'll take
this detour right here so I went around
this thing next to these guys and
literally I went boom glass wall and
when I took my drink that's like boom
the guys looked at me my drink just
spilled everywhere and I was like
different way but I died I was laughing
so hard and I told my friend all if you
will not believe what just happened to
me I literally ran into a glass wall it
felt like one of those Windex
commercials like I did not know that
wall was there do you ever get so bored

glorified this is misma mcavee old 1971

burn him to death well Jack may look
really horrifying to be frozen I would
probably want to freeze to death

freeze to death
Emily dark says what's the weirdest
thing a guy trying to hit on you has

the mall by myself and this was like
when I was younger in my teenage years

like straight up in my bra
I'm very conservative I don't like show
my boobs a lot or anything like that if
I show anything on my body it's my legs

you can see that in the way I dress at
the time but uh he I had my bra on he
just walked right in and I was like oh

it Smith oh nine one zero asked what is
your biggest regret and accomplishment
biggest accomplishment by far that I'm
so proud of is this channel right here
started from the bottom and now we're
here it's so crazy to look back on all
videos to be like oh my god what was I
thinking but I mean wow it's so amazing
I never ever in my life expected to
almost have 700,000 subscribers and
almost 40 million views like it blows my
mind and it's such an accomplishment
I've worked really hard I've tried to
make good videos for you guys I'm
constantly trying to learn new editing
things and just new topics to do videos
on so I'm working really hard but with
the support of you guys none of this
would be possible
I'm so proud of it and I just I can't
I'm I love it I amazing I'm speechless I
can't say thing and my biggest regret
would have to be my biggest regret is
letting certain people into my life and
altering my personality and how I acted
for so long and I was mean and I wasn't
happy and I regret that more than
anything
letting the negative people and then
their negative energy into my life and
change
me and who I was just that wasn't me
this is the last question I'm going to
answer for this video and it is from
Marshall blues and she asked what is the
best thing you love about makeup makeup
just has the ability to give you that
inner confidence and to really be like
I'm here but it just makes you have that
confidence makes you feel beautiful and
nothing is better than feeling good
about yourself your happiness is the
thing that needs to come first
if you feel beautiful that will just
radiate out you should feel beautiful
without makeup though - I actually
learned to feel beautiful without makeup
on YouTube which is kind of like weird
because you know people will hound me
for days about how different I look
without makeup honey I wrong no makeup
all the time I am not ashamed of my bare
face and I used to be before YouTube I
would never go out without makeup on
because people have seen my making bare
face and you know what if you want to
date me and want to know what I look
like without makeup go to
www.youtube.com/lehrenhollywood

months but I might do more if you guys
really do enjoy them and yeah forget to
subscribe to my channel so you don't
miss out on any of my videos and I will
