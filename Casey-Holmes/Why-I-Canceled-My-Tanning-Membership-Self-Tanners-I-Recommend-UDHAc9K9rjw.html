gonna be a jumble like of stuff and
information and all that this is not a
tutorial or an exact review this is just
kind of me talking about things that has
happened today and I really wanted to
tell you guys so of course it is gonna
be about what the title is but I have
two things I want to discuss before I
get into that long video so hopefully
will make this I don't make this too
long first things first this company did
send me this product I don't have to
review it I'm not sent this to review
this is just for me to personally try
out its the shaved hair organics
rosehips black soap this is what it
looks like I don't know yeah excuse my
tanning mark yeah I'll talk about that a
minute but um this is what it looks like
the bottle I'm pretty sure this is like
a full size I don't know they told me
they were going to send me samples and
then I saw this a big ol 4 ounce bottle
so I was like wow and this is a lot of
product in it it's filled to the brim
and you don't need a lot of it at all so
this is supposed to actually instantly
firm skin smooth away wrinkles and
single bound
acne busting power in home Michael derm
without the abrasion and amazing results
in a minute today so I'm excited to see
what it does um the smell is like to me
like natural stuff like this like legit
natural smells awful like it just those
but this is supposed to be great stuff
so I can't wait to see when I think
about this and if you maybe it'll be in
my skincare routine who knows so they
send me that and let me know if you've
tried it and if you like it because
that's the main reason why I even wanted
to tell you guys about it because I just
want to anybody else has tried it they
also sent me this little mini like
little jar thing like whatever you put I
think this is the Argan green coffee I
serum this is actually supposed to be
very lightly massage into underneath
your eyes supposed to really help
brighten it up and stuff and so I'm
excited to try this out the most I think
because I'm all about using stuff for
underneath my eyes lately
you
so on to what you guys have seriously
even watch this video for I know a lot
of you are very anti tanning I have had
that voiced enough times and I know I
literally like a week ago just put up
attaining video but I don't know if I'm
gonna take that down I don't think I
will because there's a lot of people out
there that still do tan but I just
wanted to go ahead and say that I have
cancelled my tanning membership for the
tanning bed I will be strictly self
tanner and outside but outside
tanner whatever I went to the
dermatologist today and now I don't have
skin cancer or anything like that um
before we think can into this video I
don't have any kind of problems on my
skin other than breaking out that's the
main reason why I went because I'm
starting to like breakout right here
around my neck and like underneath my
chin a little bit
and a little bit all over my face and it
has never happened to me before so I
went to the doctor he prescribed me a
pill I have to take once a day and then
I have to apply lotion to these areas to
my face or to my neck and my face and a
little bit on my back two times a day so
he prescribed me some prescriptions he
never really said what exactly was wrong
with my skin he just said your skin is
angry and I'm like no Sherlock like of
course it's angry I've never had this
happen before so you didn't really say
what was wrong but I don't know he just
gave me some prescriptions and stuff and
told me what to do so I'm just listening
and then I have a two week I think like
update appointment that I have to make
so yeah anyways on to what I'm talking
about okay so the reason why I even
decided to stop tanning was because you
know when you go to the dermatologist
I've only been twice in my life and
that's including today and I feel like
if you do not leave the dermatologist
with something to scare the hell out of
you you did not go and like really look
around the place and really pay
attention because they have posters
everywhere of what certain stuff looks
like on your skin and what can I me what
can result to cancer especially the
melanoma stuff um so I was looking at
that on the wall and you know I'm by
myself so my things just start going
through my mind and I'm like oh my gosh
you know this could seriously like kill
me well really broke the
I think as my mom calling me and saying
you know I got the doctor I'm like yes
she cuz she's really wanting to know
what's going on with my skin as well and
she was like well you tell him I have to
come back up there too because I have to
get more stuff burned off and I kind of
discovered a bunch of other spots as
well and she has had skin cancer and I
know a bunch of you probably gonna be
like why are you still going why were
you even still going when your mom had
cancer
her skin cancer she had little she
didn't have like skank well maybe she
did have skin cancer I loved but she had
like the moles where it could have
turned into the cancer so she got and
burn off that's what she had and
actually have it like the cancer cancer
like on her dying bed or anything like
that um thank God
but you know she kind of like was
talking about it to me and she was like
you know he hurts really bad it hurts
really bad when he burns it off and
stuff like that and it like burnt my
heart I was like God mom like I don't
want to hear this when I really you know
I need to hear it but like it's sad
because she's only like mid-40s sorry
mom if I'm wrong I know you're in your
40s oh but she's like mid-40s and she
just wanted to be going through that
she's way too young to be dealing with
that kind of stuff um but she kind of
made me feel like you know I don't want
to go through that at her age and I
don't want to have to deal with it and
me and my mom like every time I get
stuff like this this I'll talk about in
just a minute
whenever I get stuff sitting like this
sit in the mail I talked to my mom I'm
like hey do you want to try this out
because I know we used to tan a lot I
usually just tell her I'm like hey you
want to try this out with me see how you
like it so I have another opinion as
well in it and um I just I don't know I
know she likes to be tan but she will
never go back to attain a bed and that
is something that for me is very
surprising but I mean it's common sense
but to me she used to tan so much it's
crazy for her for me to even think she
just said I'm not tanning anymore I'm
never going back into a tanning bed
that's when you know it's serious when
someone he really just needs to do
something and then completely cuts it
dry so she broke the ice for me whenever
I decided to go to Taemin and cancel and
I had the kind of membership where I
paid for a year and I was like hey you
know I know I have a contract with you
but for medical reasons like I just
back for my derm and I really want to
cancel my membership and she was like
she's like well that's fine but you know
if I cancel your contract when you can
never have anything back again with us
smells like in my mind I didn't says I
lied because it's just what I read but
in my mind I'm like if I want to cancel
why the heck would I want to come back
here I didn't even like place anyways
but si this besides the point um so I
cancelled a she's like you know you
could still come to the 14th and I'm
like oh you ain't got to worry about
none of that I'm not coming back so um
yeah that's the reason why I stopped
painting not because of anybody else I
think it's just my mom I don't want to
go through that and nor do I want to see
anybody go through that in my life or
have anybody look at me going through it
as well if that makes any sense at all
I'm going to talk about some self
tanners first off I did post this
picture that I must show you on
Instagram today
and I have to say I'm completely
completely shocked with this product now
I just showed you guys this this is the
Sun Goddess Sun tanning lotion now I was
sent this a couple days ago so this is
not a full-blown review at all if you
want one let me know but this is in dark
and I just want to say my fizzes my
first impressions I guess you can say
holy canoli do you see how don't realize
were like in that picture that's with
natural lighting like natural sunlight
like my legs are so freakin dark right
now my feet look like super dark and
like look at my shoulder it's like it's
just crazy how dark it is like it looks
darker than my face honestly right now
but design I don't think maybe I need to
put some bronzer on my face this stuff
is bomb and like I just could not
believe this is just from the
application from the application of this
this is ten times darker than the
application of this which is the fake
big flawless and I have swore by list
since I've gotten it this is a hell of a
lot darker than this when you apply it
let me just tell you that um and usually
I apply a couple coats of this too I was
so excited about that um I'm not usually
into lotions because I really don't you
know I hate get on my hands and I know I
already have like some problem areas but
that's just because I haven't really
used a lotion and a very long time for
sunless tanning tell you right now it is
so dark on my skin it honestly looks
like I laid in a tanning bed today like
no joke so I so far I'm really liking
this and this is honestly like I usually
I'm a spray person I love my sprays but
this is a good lotion they do give you
gloves but you have to rub this sucker
in like I'm talking about a new better
work quick because it will dry really
quickly it's like you're a virgin to
sunless tanning lotions and stuff like
that just really be careful with this
because it will be so streaky and stuff
if you don't really like rub it into
your skin like you should but if you're
interested in seeing like an update
video on how I'm really liking this
stuff let me know because I'll be more
than happy to do it for you they were
kind enough to let my subscribers have
10% off so just check the link down
below and it will also put the coupon
code here which
probably my username I'm pretty sure it
is but it's 10% off go check this out
like I said I will leave the promo code
down below but I'm pretty sure it's me
username this is seriously like gonna be
I have a feeling one of my favorite
self-tanners and for me to feel like I
look like I just came out of a tanning
bed that's a huge deal so so far I like
this and also regular retail for this is
thirty eight ninety five and that's not
with shipping or anything like that so
also I'm going to talk about two other
self tanners are actually pretty decent
you can get these from Amazon which is
where I got mine this one is one that I
swore by before I of course try this one
on and this is the fake fake flawless
self-tanning liquid talked about this in
my training video the very first one I
ever ever made and I still think it's
really awesome it is streak free you do
get a mitt with it honestly my mitt with
somewhere I don't know where it went but
um this is a really really easy product
to apply if you're kind of more like I
said like a virgin to self handing and
stuff like that and it's your first time
ever doing it
I recommend this because it's so easy
and with the mitt it just you don't get
streaks at all so I highly recommend
this one especially if you are new to
tanning also with this one um I believe
it comes in different colors so I think
you can get this in a lighter shade as
well and then the last thing is from
bake bake bake bake bake bake as well
this is elixir jet luxurious golden
bronze airbrush instant self-tan streak
free easy application I like this kind
of whenever I used to self tan for just
on the go when I really quickly need to
just apply some self-tanner this is the
one I use does not smell as good as this
one this one smells actually really
really good for a self-tanner this one I
don't know what it sounds like but I
don't really like smell of it oh and
this one the smell of this is kind of
like it's not bad but it's not the smell
good of this but this has a lot more
color to it so yeah
those are these self tanners I recommend
so far like I said I will put the coupon
code down below if you're interested
I had a lot of people asking me on
Instagram blonde Calero where'd you even
get that from so link is down below if
you're interested I hope you guys enjoy

excited that I quit self or quit tanning
