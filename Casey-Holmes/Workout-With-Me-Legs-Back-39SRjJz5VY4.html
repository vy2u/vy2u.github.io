a different one from my regular beauty
videos I've had a ton of questions from
you guys ever since I posted that
kendall Jenner video I know I've been
doing a lot of videos I'm like ever
since I posted this but if you guys want
it you're gonna get it and I can all
join a video I have my legs shown in
some shorts and a lot of you want to
know what my workout routine was for my
legs and I'm all about legs honey my
favorite day to workout is my legs and
back I do those two on the same days and
I love them they're just my favorite to
workout I love working out my back I
love working out my legs and my butt
because I don't have a butt unless I
work for it so I figured I would film it
and show you guys keep in mind I am NOT
a professional I am NOT a trainer this
is just what I do and what works for me
I've read a bunch of fitness magazines
for women I really recommend them if you
are wanting to try different things out
I'll put a picture in here of the
magazines that I love because they come
with posters and you can see what
exercises certain models do and stuff
like that and it helps give you ideas
that really helped me in the beginning
and yeah and don't be afraid to lift
some weight if you're a woman because
trust me it'll make a world of
difference cardio is great I do do
cardio and your spin class for my cardio
personally because I'm not really a
runner I don't like to run I find it
boring and I'm just like get me off this
treadmill but it loves spin class it's
so fun it's really really really hard
and it's just it's so intense so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video take it for
it's worth again I am nowhere near a
professional this is just what I do to
get a nice toned but it and toned legs
if you do enjoy these videos go ahead
and give it a thumbs up so I can keep
them in them for you and just going in
the gym and filming and doing it you
know whatever thank you guys for
watching I'll see you in the next video
bye
so this is one of the first workouts I
do this is for my back and hamstrings
the bar itself is 45 pounds and on this
clip I did have five pounds on each side
all I'm doing is bending down and I'm
keeping my back straight and then I'm
gonna pull up with my back just make
sure you keep that back straight and
pull the bar up with your lower back
this is one of my favorites it's squats
and I do have 25 pounds on each side of
the bar as well and I just put my legs
out in front of me and then I squat down
like I'm sitting in a chair and make
sure you keep your legs out in front of
you so you don't hurt your knees and
your back as much but I just go all the
way down like I'm sitting on a chair so
this machine I do a hundred pounds and I
go as far down as I can with my legs
bent and I just push up and I really
like this one this I can really feel it
targeting the butt so of course this is
another one of my favorites
with this workout I put on I think it's
about 55 or 70 I can't remember but this
is going to work your quads basically
I'm lifting the weight up so I'm pushing
up and it's going to work those quads
and this is not really one of my
favorites but it gets the job done
this is a workout I actually saw on
YouTube I had wanted to find different
workouts for my back and this is one
that I saw and I've really loved it and
I've been using it ever since so all I'm
doing is bending over with a little bit
of an angle but I'm keeping my back
straight and I'm pulling that weight
with my back I'm using 20 pounds here
and you're gonna notice if you're doing
it wrong because if you feel it mostly
in your arms and you're not doing it
right you need to really flex your back
and pull up with your back muscle so
that way you can work your lats
this is another one of my favorites I'm
just going to go forward act like I'm
rowing a boat kind of I just want to
pull this down towards my stomach and
keep my back straight and again this
will also work your back as well and I
do more workouts like I stated in the
beginning of this video but this is just
what I did that day so if you want to
see more then just go ahead and like
this video and I will see you guys in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
