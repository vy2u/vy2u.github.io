a very highly requested video and it's a
review on my wise cell baby doll mascara
I've been using this for quite a few
months now and it is definitely my Holy
Grail mascara I absolutely love it it's
definitely a splurge it's about $30 it's
so ridiculous to spend $30 on a mascara
but I just fell in love with this so in
this review I'm going to do the same
thing that I do in all my reviews I'll
have a little side panel probably on
this side showing you guys me applying
the mascara so first off it's in this
gorgeous gold packaging you can't get
past this packaging like it is so
stunning I felt so luxurious when I
first got it in the mail like the first
time I had ever purchased it the reason
why I bought this is I had a sample of
it from Sephora and one of these little
bags that I got and right when I tried
the sample I fell in love usually
whenever I try staple mascaras I can
tell right off the bat if I'm going to
love it that's just the kind of person I
am it's really easy for me to see if I'm
going to like a mascara or not now I
love this mascara it's very volumizing
very lengthening it's beautiful I have
nothing bad to say about it I do about
two applications of it and you'll see
that inside panel I'll let you know when
I'm going on to the second application I
just think it is so gorgeous now the
only problem that I have with it is when
you first purchase it and you apply it
to your bottom lash to my lower lashes
are so long that they do touch my skin
underneath and sometimes mascara will
rub on my skin a little bit and just get
smudgy but once it kind of dries out
probably after a couple weeks then it's
good to go and I don't experience it
anymore it is a flake on me
it does take me some time to take this
mascara off that's mainly because I put
so much mascara on I don't even need
false lashes when I wear this mascara I
don't apply this mascara when I do wear
false lashes just because once I apply
mascara I'm like oh I don't feel like
doing that extra step of applying false
lashes because I honestly don't feel
like I need it every time I wear this
mascara I always get compliments
especially in videos you guys have
always wondered what I've been wearing
my lashes look long and full and I don't
have false
she's on it's the Sun scare it's just so
amazing I highly recommend it no a bunch
of you have went out and purchased this
based off of my recommendations and
you've told me that you loved it so I'm
so happy that you love it I will say one
thing though if you're looking for a
drugstore dupe the one that I think's
the closest is the rocket from
Maybelline just because it still gives
you a ton of volume just like the YSL
baby doll does it's not as great as a
YSL but if I had to have a dupe for it
it would definitely be this mascara
because it does have the volumizing
power just like the YSL one as you can
see from the before and after photos
it's a huge difference this mascara is
very long wearing it doesn't weigh down
my lashes which is huge for me because
lashes tend to get way down really
really easily and that does not happen
with this no matter how many coats I put
on there still up and ready to go I mean
literally I could wear this for hours
and I won't have any problems with it I
will leave a link down below if you're
interested in checking it out on Sephora
so thank you guys so much for watching I
hope you enjoyed this highly requested
video and don't forget to like it if you
like reviews and I will see you all in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
