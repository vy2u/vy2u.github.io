yesterday which is the 18th and I went
darker obviously um basically if you
don't like it you don't like it whatever
but I feel like a lot of you have been
waiting for this like for so long my
blonde hair was either a love-hate kind
of thing is you really liked it or you
really hated it and trust me I heard
your opinions I've been debating going
darker for a few months now if you've
been following me on Twitter or Facebook
and Instagram anything like that you
know I've been kind of debating on it
and finally I was just like you know
what I need to do it because my hair was
getting super super damaged it needed a
change it really needed a break for my
color we only used one color and I
wanted to color match my roots because I
wanted it to be my natural color up top
so my roots started coming in it wasn't
like super noticeable because I was so
over having to do my hair like every few
months so we did color match our roots
so this is my natural hair color up top
and as you can see we did keep some of
the blond in here just so I wasn't like
one full color cuz that would have
really really really freaked me out
probably like it's already different
enough looking at myself being this dark
but imagine if it was like a all brown
color that would been really dramatic
and it would have been just like who is
who is this I really really like it it's
kind of like a subtle ombre type thing I
love the color I think it looks really
good um I went to a new stylist and I
went to her because she was like trained
on ombre my whole decision was to go in
there and get an ombre but when I was
finally in there I was like you know I
just kind of want to go more natural
like I'm with my natural hair color up
top because I'm tired my roots coming in
and I was really tired of just seeing
like blonde and like roots and it was
just getting on my nerves so that's why
I did it and my hair feels actually a
lot better already it's still damaged
because you know you can't just repair
super damaged hair overnight I was I had
blond in my hair for over 4 years and
it's definitely different seeing myself
with darker hair but it's growing on me
really starting to like it and I did
post a picture on Instagram right after
we did it and I went home and I want to
thank every single one of you who posted
on my Twitter my facebook my Instagram
anything and has said sweet things I
really truly appreciate it but I'm
really really liking it my stylist did a
good job and she was super sweet the
whole time super happy I went to her it
was the first time I went to her and I
knew she was probably nervous of taking
me to it bleached blonde you know up top
to more of a brunette so and I love the
way she did it I felt so comfortable
with her I do really like the hair it's
just getting used to it you know what
I'm saying if you've ever had that
transition where you went from a really
dramatic color to a Miller dramatic
color it's pretty intense
thank you guys again so much for all the
sweet words it really meant the world to
me and a lot of you are actually asking
about my username my name on here for
YouTube is tasty homes now I just
decided to update my Google+ and just
update my name to Kacie homes you know
what's been happening to a bunch of
other people as well if you want to
change it or not and I just felt like
using my name just because I felt like
using it I know a lot of you love this
blondie and told me I'm known for its
blondie but you know it's it's not who I
am just a name change shouldn't be that
big of a deal I feel like it's just a
name change and we're going by my name
now so yes my name is now Casey Holmes
so make sure you're looking for that in
your subscription box because I know a
bunch of people have been really
confused about it you've messaged me
common saying you got really confused
cuz I think in the top when you type it
in I think you could still type it's
blondie but I'm not positive on that so
I'm not sure and one more thing one sad
sad thing happened yesterday I lost my
ring I'm pretty upset about it I don't
know where I lost it I don't even know
when I had it on because I'll just keep
it on for forever unless I'm taking a
shower or washing my hands I'll take it
off but I didn't go on any public
restrooms yesterday is there not in my
restrooms at my house and I always take
it off for I take a shower so I don't
know where it is it was really loose so
it probably just fell off but I'm really
sad so if you're wondering where my ring
is I can't find it so
I'm really upset we're gonna have to try
to get a new one or something very soon
but yes so thank you guys so much for
watching I hope you like the new change
please don't be me I'm still gonna good
too but I really do appreciate all the
sweet words you guys have already said
to me so far and cement the world so
thank you guys so much again I know I've
been updating every day this week which
is kind of crazy but I'm also updating
or I'm uploading another video tomorrow
it's going to be an awesome video so
make sure your stay tuned and keep a
lookout in your subscription box for it
because you don't want to miss out so
thank you guys so much for watching and
I will see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
