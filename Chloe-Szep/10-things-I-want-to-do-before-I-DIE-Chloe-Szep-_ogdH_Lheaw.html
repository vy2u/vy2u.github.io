just picked 10 and that's how guys sorry

want to do before I die

life number three learn to play the
guitar I really would love to learn a
musical instrument because I just feel
like playing with your tab would be cool

sleep on the beach before I die and I
don't mean in a tent and I mean
like sleep on the beach actually brought
sand nothing else I think it would be
cool number five this is not like a goal

before I die because it is the hardest
thing I will ever do not to eat sugar

like I have no energy if I don't have my
sugar cake for the
