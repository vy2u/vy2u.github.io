my name is Chloe if you don't know me
and welcome if you know me you know that
I love fitness and activewear fashion
and all that stuff so today's video is
super exciting and I love filling holes
and especially activewear because I
believe in actively literally every day
I wear active way sir today's figure is
obviously an active black hole I'm hot
about with active parallel to bring you
this video they sent me a bunch of stuff
to review on my channel and show you
guys I'm going to squat test it oh I'm
going to do some funky movements so that
I can show you that they assert my
mobility you can very easily in them and
I'm gonna get technical here so I've
pretty much worn this apparel for the
last week so that I can tell you guys
what I really think about it and all
that sort of stuff so there's a few
different let me say like collections
that these guys have so I'm going to
read them out so there's condition tops
which I'm going to show you I'm going to
try to launder them to show you it all
there's a rice leggings there are false
leggings and there are all different
materials some of the materials might be
better for you or if you like a cooler
material well that sort of stuff if you
like and really high-waisted that's
really how I should then this just like
stand is high waisted
so that we have the force leggings and
then there's the in pectus accent
leggings and then the impact of sports
bras so I'm wearing one of the sports
bras right now Sanctus I'm going to
actually believe in this brand but
everything is the best material in super
comfy so I'm just going to get straight
into reviewing them and showing you what
they look like on just saying I'm sorry
if I seem adaptive wear so whatever
actually wear are everywhere I have an
Instagram page with cool does that fit
now every second photo I tell you what
active wear I'm wearing so believe me
and trust me my active wear choices are
the best of this I start showing you
guys what everything looks like on and
how flexible we can be in all of the
stuff okay so the first item that I'm in
is the impetus Sprott sport the impact
of sports bra this oh my god it's so
comfy and it has padding in it but you
can remove the padding if you drive like
the padding this bra super supportive
and the quality is amazing
super stretchy I'm sorry happy with
these sports bras and I'm going to live
in them they make your boobs look really
nicely shaped some sports bras you need
to see nips or the padding goes weird in
them if you want Patti but I've done
with these the padding sits perfectly
and shapes your boobs nice and round and
this one comes in two different colors
of
you guys as well but they're very
versatile colors so they will match with
basically anything today I wore this
crop with my leggings and it looks fine
together so you have a big tick from
this one
okay so next I'm going to move on to the
impetus accent leggings these are the
ones that I wore to the gym today so
these are the impetus accent leggings so
they have a waistband around here so it
goes just above your belly button and I
feel like these funds that make your
butt look really good but this band is
so good because it just pulls everything
in and that stitches that waist in a
little bit and those hips these were so
good to work out at the gym today in
I'll show you how so they're not
see-through at all even with my lights
which show everything and you can
literally move everywhere even like
stretching you can stretch super well
and then
but next I'm going to move on to the
false leggings these ones are really
really nice start we have the olive
color then we have the rose and this
one's at the Mirage color and then just
black these are all only fifty dollars a
pair which is awesome that is seriously
so good for a really good quality pair
of jean tights oh my god I absolutely
love these the material is insane
so soft but also stretchy and these ones
are so easy to move in as well squat
test so none of these at all you can see
through it come up high enough through
pull everything in which I love I love
wearing I never ever wear anything
that's not how I stood to the gym then
you have a little pocket at the back
that would fit your gym cut in so I
always struggled to find where I can put
my gym card could easily pop it in there
easily stretch in
okay now I'm getting pops from like
putting one take you up pretty one take
him off next we have the arize leggings
so the arize leggings look at me like
this I'm going to try the one for you as
well they have this things which is the
different point for these ones the same
sir bit stretchy really good a little
bit thicker than the force leggings but
still super comfy so these are we get so
much wear out of in winter because give
you a little bit more warm but I will
these to the gym in it's like summer now
a couple of days ago and now have it
these colors are really cool they're a
bit more like grainy kind of look if
that's if you will if that's what you
want to call it um so we've got them in
so we've got them in the charcoal then
the lilac so this one's a lilac this is
such a stunning color then the pale
khaki so these are like a cross between
I don't if you can speed properly but
like a white really really pale green
speckly and then we've just got them in
the black as well so let's try them off
so these are the ones that are super
super high waisted so they go right up
to here so you can easily get away with
just wearing a crop with these vines but
they really pull that waist in which is
so good they're a little bit more
stretchy than the others as well squats
here
and they're all sir full-length
super-comfy these ones easy to move
around in but yeah I love how that
stupid juvenile I stood sir
if you like that how wasted girl these
ones up for you
so that collection was the arised
collection I really like them because
they are really high waisted and you can
just get away with wearing a crop and
the pants to the gym I really really
like those those ones are fifty-five
dollars again I mean that is so she
flings lastly we have the condition tops
so I will one of these to the gym today
I wore the jumper because wasn't the bit
but because it was a little bit cold in
Melbourne today let me just put this on
for you guys not a very thick material
it's breathable and stretchy which I
like
like very gym material and they're all
cropped which I like so these leggings
go perfectly with these hoodies and
these little hoodies they're only 50
tons as well okay so the cropped hoodie
comes in a star in color which is so
nice this fabric can I just say is so
soft I would literally sleep with it
sorry this is it in a star color I love
this color it's really nice it has
little little detail here you can tie at
the side they also come sleeveless so
you can get the sleeveless hoodies a
sleeveless hoodies which come in the
black and the star as well so they're
cropped ulcer
so it's the star in that one and that's
the all-black
I did not even plan to finish in all
black that's weird
but this is such a cute outfit didn't
even plan it burnt these crops the 45
and the long-sleeve crops hoodie crops
uh 50 so everything's priced from like
forty to fifty five dollar switches let
me say that's just a bargain one more
time so I have to say in the way of
leggings the force leggings probably my
favorite but that's just me the arize
leggings are amazing as well as other
wear these to the gym so often you will
literally see me on snapchat soften
energy in this collection so but I'm
super happy with everything the quality
the sizes I'm a size small and
everything once again the price
everything is like perfect and I would
never ever want to show you guys a brand
that I wasn't actually really really
happy with them that I really loved so I
did test these out a week before to make
sure that they were comfortable and they
were good quality all that sort of stuff
and they have Chloe's the tick of
approval so that's not enough I don't
know what is actually gave me a discount
code if you guys were wanting to get
some stuff off of their website I'll
link their website in the description
and there's a card arise twenty four
twenty percent of all the leggings so
that's amazing they're so cheap already
and 20% off fifty dollars is that is
about it but I just want to say a thank
