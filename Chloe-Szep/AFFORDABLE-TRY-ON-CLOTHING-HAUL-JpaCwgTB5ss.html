sponsored fastly I just got this super
cute set I really love matching sets
this one is a blue camo set and I teamed
it up with this cute long-sleeved top it
doesn't put the sides it's got some
really cute detail but these are the
pants and then I just wear it with these
jackets right over my shoulders
next up I got this cute little white
tracksuit sir nothing I love more than a
Trekkie set that you can pair with
sneakers or some high heels depending on
which way you'd like to bear it any sort
of track you said I live in my tracksuit
so if I can make it somewhat fashionable
I'm like all-in
give it to me
next up I grabbed these super cute pants
I love this with this casual like crop
jumper it looks really really cute their
flare pants which was really nice as
well and they have a little pink at the
bottom excuse my change of light this
area just life changes like every second

pieces of the lot that I got it's super
comfy it's really really cute it just
really comfy and I can just wear it out
like I'm going to friend's house tonight
for a games night and this is something
that I would just wear it's just like a
comedy set
next up I got this cute little top sorry
about a lot once again guys but looks
really cute with the colors I've been
cropped to top that you could wear with
just black jeans and a black jacket over
the top and this is my name my mom's
name on it
she breathe so this is black see-through
set this I can wear over my swimmers
should be really cute it's got flare
bottoms and it's holy throughout the
whole thing so obviously I would not
wear this in winter but when I go to
Bali and on holidays and stuff and this
is absolutely perfect to wear ever my
sadness

with a big jumper over it you could wear
it in summer I love this one I reckon
