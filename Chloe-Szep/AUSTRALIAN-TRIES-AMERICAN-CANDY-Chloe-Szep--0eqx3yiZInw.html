filming in America American I'm not
freaking married and what am i doing I
feel me an ice giant rise American candy
ha ha my mask order got these sent from
Joy's delight so I'll link that website
below it has heaps of like foreign candy
which you can go and purchase ok thank
you so much guys
the first one I'm going to try is a
tootsie roll
alright I actually have a lot about this
but I've never tried one oh it's like
camera coffee so it's good
alright I'm not very fasting when it
comes to like sweets because anything
sweet will check on my people ok the
next is a Baby Ruth well Baby Ruth ball
grams of protein oh yeah peanuts it's
kind of similar to a Snickers bar
good luck mouse bar I can do that that's
really good I like it
next is candy corn cable-car mother home
I thought they were gonna be like
gummies but they like really sweet
really sweet oh my god that's me yeah
Reese's piece soon races I'm the peanut
butter cups for any headline I am
addicted to these I've had used to buy
them so much because they're just so
good
what's that peanut butter it's like I
don't know it's really weird it's like a
powdery peanut but I don't know but
they're heavenly oh my god so whip is
strawberry molted bulls
it's like Maltesers baby everything
they would they like mulch I like them
not bad on the taste but versus I love
this that's an excuse to eat junk
Altoids curiously strong mint cinnamon
flavor pink what is that
yuck you mint and cinnamon do not mix Oh
cinnamon by itself good but mint in
cinema what is wrong with my lighting
right now sorry the last thing that I'm
trying today is hubba bubba dr. pepper
what's a mouthful a bubba bit
hurting my jewel dr. pepper actually
tastes like medicine
so things that were bad - sweet - mmm
sick too strong too minty - disgusting
all right all those zero accent nah
let's get hash tootsie roll was good
eight out of ten might just have another
bit Reese's Pieces ten out of ten Baby
Ruth 900 - what's pretty good so oh I
got these they roll on up oh you go to
ten until I saw that they have palm oil
in them there's a comment to be really
bad for me that's the end of my American
candy taste testing thank you so much
