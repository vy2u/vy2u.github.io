channel today's video is going to be a
highly requested one it's going to be my
April favorites because I haven't done a
favorites video before and I thought it
would be cool to just you know give you
a taste of my favorite sorry I am doing
it a little bit different I'm just going
to tell you like my favorites all around
then I'm going to tell you my favorite
music of the month my favorite movies of
the month and my favorite shops of the
month and my favorite quotes of the
month so if you would like to see my
food my Hecker disgusting and watch this
video if you would like to start let's
do Baja so if you'd like to see my
monthly favorites for April then keep on
watching so I have been using organic
coconut oil for basically everything
this month it's organic coconut oil
cold-pressed I get mine from Kohl's
I use it as my makeup remover um my my
sister eyes I put it on after bed my
hair's a funky and I like it anyway what
I was saying was I have been using this
coconut oil it's literally an holy grail
that would be orchid if I dropped it but
I'm loving it it's literally one for
everything you can use it as a
moisturizer for your legs and your face
and just everything you can wash your
hair with it and apparently it's good
for hair growth I don't really know but
it's just an all-around good old Fang I
mean if you cook with it it must be your
earthly body so there yeah I've been
using that a lot as you can tell this
and it
next is my skins to shoot Aibileen
I bought this with my friend Carly
because she recommended it
it brightens and refreshes your eyes so
I feel like it tightens my eyes which is
great because I have clients all wrinkly
eyes
not really but stops those wrinkles so
yeah I'm loving this this month that was
Mitchell oh they killed me
I'm also loving but math science because
who doesn't love a good ten if you don't
like ten then GCF are another thing I'll
be loving my hair looks crazy but I
don't even care
another thing I've been loving is this
elf eyebrow kit Callie also recommend to
this agent Kallus it's just like it's
got like a jelly and then like a powder
that and it's just like sir cheap and
it's so good at the same time it's
something like it does from came out so
well I'm laugh with that one another
love is - month is asada foundation it
is amazing like pretty good coverage for
minerals foundation like actually it's
an amazing coverage for mineral
foundation I've been using this for a
while because I went to a dermatologist
and they recommended this so I was like
why not I mean it is quite expensive for
the shoe but it does last a long time
and it is extremely good for your face
but doesn't have any of those nasties in
there and it doesn't make you break out
so that's the reason I love this one and
the shade I have is Miami sir
ena it's called a start-up mineral
velvet cream
all right by the way guys see that funny
little harmless do you like my little
hardware Snapple
I bought this love thing it's so good I
love it
another one actually I've been loving is
this Bulgari perfectly man I don't know
what smell it is but it's Bulgari
something just look for this bottle if
it's such a different smell but I really
like it it's a very unique smell so that
is all for my like physical you know
touch sort of stuff I'm just going to
move on to my favorite shops to this
month which would have to be which
reseed and misguided online it's so
cheap or mine at misguided end I just
have the best stuff basics bit of
everything my favorite movies this month
would have to be the longest ride I went
and saw it and I'm absolutely in love
with it it was so good and I walked out
at the end and I was like to my sister
that was so good hey and she's like that
was a fake sheet and I was like well
I'll continue living my fantasy why I
really want to say I'm friended because
it looks quite scary and I'm like quite
scary movies
five favourite Court this last month is
when was the last time you did something
for the first time I love that part
because like it challenges you to do
things that you haven't done before so
my favorite music for April would have
to be lighting the Ducks just for Chris
Brown Oh in my head and nobody loves
like Tori Kelly autumn leaves by Chris
Brown and loving Chris Brown this month
pinku top king-size whoever it is kisses
the laughs know yourself by drank
running into the six mouths

favorites it's just quick you know sharp
short all the time I hope you guys
