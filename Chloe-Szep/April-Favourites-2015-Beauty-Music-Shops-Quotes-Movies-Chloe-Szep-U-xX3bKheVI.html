welcome back to my channel today's video
is going to be a highly requested one
it's going to be my April favorites
because I haven't done a favorites video
before and I thought it would be cool to
just you know give you a taste of my
favorite so I am doing it a little bit
different I'm just going to tell you
like my favorites all round then I'm
going to tell you my favorite music of
the month my favorite movies of the
month my favorite chops of the month and
my favorite quotes of the month so if
you would like to see my phone my hair
go disgusting and watch this video just
kidding if you would like to stir the
Bloods jus baha so if you'd like to see
my monthly favorites for April then keep
on watching so i have been using organic
coconut oil for basically everything
this month um it's organic coconut oil
cold-pressed i get mine from kohls i use
it as my makeup remover um my
moisturizer I put it on after dead my
hair's Lee funky and I like it anyway
what I was saying was i have been using
this coconut oil it's literally and holy
grail that would be awkward if I dropped
it but I'm loving it it's literally one
for everything you can use it as a
moisturizer for your legs and your faith
and just everything you can wash your
hair with it and apparently it's good
for hair growth I don't really know but
it's just an all around good old Fang I
mean if you cook with it must be your
earthly body so there you I've been
using that a lot as you can tell this
and
next is my skin's to shoot i believe um
i bought this with my friend Carly
because she recommended it it brightens
and refreshes your eyes so I feel like
it tightens my eyes which is great
because I have clients are wrinkly eyes
not really but stops those wrinkles so
yeah I'm loving this this month that was
my chili be cool mohammed to work i'm
also loving but their sales because who
doesn't love a good 10 if you don't like
10 then GTFO another thing i'll be
loving my hair looks crazy but i don't
even care another thing i've been loving
is this elf eyebrow kit um kelly also
recommended this saturday's colors it's
just like it's got like a gel here and
then like a powder there and it's just
so so cheap and so good at the same time
it's only like eight dollars from kmart
so long life with that one another love
of minus month is asada foundation it is
amazing like pretty good coverage from
mineral foundation like actually it's an
amazing coverage for a mineral
foundation i've been using this for a
while because i went to a dermatologist
and they recommended this so like why
not i mean it is quite expensive for the
true but it does last a long time and it
is extremely good for your face but
doesn't have any of those nasties in
there and it doesn't make you break out
so that's the reason i love this one and
the shade i have is miami sir ena it's
called asada mineral velvet cream lovin
that one
all right by the way guys feel a tiny
little homeless so do you like my little
home where they're bored i bought this
love thing it's so cute i love it
another one actually I've been loving is
this bvlgari perfect man I don't know
what smell it is but it's bvlgari
something just look for this bottle if
it's such a different smell but I really
like it it's a very unique smell so that
is all for my life physical you know
touch sort of stuff I'm just going to
move on to my favorite shops to this
month which would have to be which
reseed and misguided online it's so
cheap online at misguided and i just
have the best stuff basics bev
everything my favorite movies this month
would have to be the longest ride i went
and saw it and i'm absolutely in love
with it it was so good and i walked out
at the end and i was like my sister that
was so good hey and she's like those
fake and I was like well I'll
continue living my fantasy why um I
really want to see unfriended because it
looks quite scary and I liked it quite
scary movies so understand five favorite
quote this last month is when was the
last time you did something for the
first time I love that quote because
like it challenges you to do things that
you have a tumble so there we go my
favorite music for April would have to
be Lady Anna bucks just for Chris Brown
all in my head and nobody loved by tori
kelly autumn leaves by chris brown and
loving his band is nothing
she'll King CUDA king hey guys whoever
it is kisses the laugh noise off by
Drake running into this shit's to mount
wow it won't stop by chris brown is Elsa

this map I absolutely love so that is
all for my April favorites it's just
