I'm with yo guys we are finally doing a
video i filming a boycott video cuz
everyone has boy troubles like everyone
every girl okay so we have got 400
questions here okay see boys is like
actually makes girls go nuts
alright our first question is um what do
you like in about what do we look for in
a guy personality and looks okay for me
personality wise
I love it when the bit weird and quirky
I love guys that are confident someone
that is just upfront and very caring and
considerate they need to understand that
girls are sensitive just fun I like
really outgoing guys what were your
personality ones and um my personalities
were like confident they have to be like
really nice um just I just like genuine
people that continue it legitimately the
word like down today I might have a
chat thing I don't think guys realize
like we like a bit bad boy and ago I
bought in love it but is it needs to
read a new album yeah you can't be all
laugh boo and then not gin then bring it
in its not and be like baby I love you
beautiful oh you're amazing
about you for looks I know Khloe's type
we have the most opposite type and logs
well I don't think I have a type anymore
but it's like no like a your ultimate
dream boy ultimate dream boy is like
pull darker skin blue eyes and Anais I
can't cut fit like big bit not true like
mostly I just like she loves rugby noise
and mine's like opposite I love the
pretty boy oh boy
like I like long hair beachy skinny
doesn't have to be skinny just like talk
I like tall but yeah I told time I used
to say I like bad boys but not fat like
that when they hold you and sire um have
you ever done double crochet actually
happen
um neither I really only when we've like
a group of us of saying yeah if I stay
to the gas house and like something may
have gone on the night before and we've
all kind of stumbled out how to not be
nervous around a guy like I think it's
just normal
you said it L day you would like to me
remember that they're human too yeah
they're human they're people too like
they probably nervous as well yeah why
yeah we just we just eliminated
everything and so Beth do you get easily
attached or are you comfortable around
guys I get easily touched I can I kind
of have to stop myself it's so hard like
I don't even know dating is changed so
much in a year's time it's actually
regain it's just games I began logged in
but if it's like genuine then yeah I
would get pretty easily attached because
yes if you get it like a genuine guy you
wanna you want that you don't know these
days you really don't they can be
putting on sorry was how do you how do
you know the guys into you we don't you
said I wish I could tell you the answer
because to be honest if any guys are
watching this I encourage you to cut
this act out this boy game I don't
know what you guys are playing what is
this game I bet it off
going on for tool it makes me really sad
but I think genuinely when a guy really
likes you hopefully they're not just
putting on an act normally you can tell
when they just genuinely want to be
around you and want to talk to you and
like although I their way to like
they'll make the effort but ball is
they're just like like they'll just
chewing you you know when someone's
churning a money I was back sleep
genuine have you ever been in love
what's it like I've never never probably
loved no I've never had like a full-on
like proper proper relationship me
enough matter I'd love to know like what
it's like know me to be like you feel um
how to get over go oh yeah we we had the
worst experiences when it's come to guys
so you tell me your tip well you just
don't go out perfect I'd literally stay
at home for eight months and sometimes
it just actually takes time then the
numerical I didn't I'd like seriously
haven't spoken to a guy and eight months
like I'm starting to talk to guys now
but I just wasn't talking to guys
sometimes it is really hard because she
just it's actually ridiculous girls get
very attached like that why do I get so
scared around boys it happens the manger
delicious it still happens to me I get
nervous to meet up with tinder boys or
to not I mean if you are whatever floats
your boat I personally wouldn't do it I
wouldn't know I just am an awkward
person I'd be like I can't date like
people I've never met the person I can't
just blind date them yeah I like to meet
people in person first yeah go from that
so much more we'll just be friends and
then yeah turn into something it's just
why all boys just afternoons do people
still ask for news is that I've been
living ask for a new baby maybe I think
these people know that I'm not going to
send you a new your needs are lame okay
I got a question for you what is your
biggest turn-on
in a guy like what would just give you
like everything was going really well
and then there's like two things that he
needs to do that were just like you're
just like yeah what would it be
you know you first smell oh okay smells
legitimate Lee we'll just if this guy
smells good has a nice Cologne on holy
 like that is one name change up oh
we both love 1 million it smells so good
if they're in kiss room yeah good kisser
Oh as soon as our bad customer and I
think the way they touch you knowing oh
my god not like like but like the way
that they what they're like with their
body what was your first kiss story
describe your first kiss my first like
hook up yeah hook up like Tonya in
everything I was it like a disco like a
dead well they basically pushed us
together

other here with guys yeah at know
