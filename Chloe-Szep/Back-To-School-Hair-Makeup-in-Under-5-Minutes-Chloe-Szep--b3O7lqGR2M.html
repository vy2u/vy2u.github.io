my channel today new year is going to be
a back-to-school hair-and-makeup little
because of that time of year where
everyone's going back to school and I
thought wanted to a video showing you
how I do my makeup repair is all going
Africa what I'm going to your triplet
fare off the solution so every morning
when I get up to school otherwise 13
bathrooms left brush my teeth and
flashlight I see Samoa and then I would
put on the my aurora cheap oil just one
see i can pure radiance for a sequel
it's called sonic drop that Alexis
if you already have quite lowly skin I
would recommend not using the Roses oil
and that is quite literally the school I
wouldn't go to out there or do anything
extravagant but most schools have a
don't make a fool or minimal make-up so
what I would do for school is probably a
tiny bit of gloriosa match I can put
that into my hand or you can use a brush
bit I feel like a brush will make it
look a bit more still rubbing that all
over the thing and then I do a little
bit of blush to natural places usually
have a little bit of blush to from using
my Too Faced barking Bellini - plush
slightly depending that into my cheek
and then for my c-section I use my same
app and parent and just put that in my
oily zone so that I don't get oily
throughout the day and then for my
eyebrows I solution through anything to
my autograph by June Oh like whatever
but if you were to do something to your
eyebrows I just use a little bit
and just do the ends and the staff it so
someone mascara I would just lightly go
over the lashes because as I said you
don't want it through unnatural looking
just darkening it the lashes I have
quite fair eyelashes
top and bottom I do a little bit like so
so as you can tell that still is quite
natural and then I would just finish off
her face with oh boy so on my hair what
I used to do for school was very
different to what I would do here when I
was in early math grade I I would always
break my hand here and then cook with
the back and then do it on but you had
so much how do I do it
hello hello yeah yeah yeah that's fun
someone's calling me I'll Chloe I'll do
that place okay right hello why do
people choose to call me while I'm
filming so back in my hair my hair I was
hot it down the middle and the braids my
hair on the candle and it's do a little
bottom part out just like that and then
I would put back my ribbon when I bought
my school uniform color one which was
Navy and orange I put my mean orange
ribbons in my hair but my students come
to the soup so I'm going to do two
rhythm
and that's the look that I would wear to
school just nice and natural and simple
takes literally like five minutes and
then I take my schoolbooks and I'd be
off for the day so I hope you guys
really enjoyed this video I will see you
in my next hi guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
