Swanepoel inside makeup tutorial so
firstly I'm just going straight in with
my asada foundation it's in the shade
Miami and blending that in with a damp
Beauty Blender I'm then going to take my
top shape take concealer in the shade
light and draw some strokes under my
eyes to get rid of all the dark circles
and also highlight my cheekbones I'm
then taking a damp Beauty Blender and
blending battle I'm then going in with
my Rimmel stay matte translucent powder
to set under the eye and a little bit
over the face in this tutorial I'm going
to be using me ciate cross Chloe Morello
palette we're going to using one of the
lighter brown shades to act as my
transition shade in my crease and then
using one of the darker brown colors
just under that transition shade to
create more of a shadow and I'm going to
take another darker brown shade into my
crease and just get that a bit more
depth and then I'll blend it out this
brush is so handy it has the two brushes
in one and doing the same to the other
eye
in the picture of Candace she's taken
our eye shadow out a little bit further
so I'm just blending my eye shadow out
towards my temples and using this flat
surface to do so so that I don't get any
fallout and the same to the other side
this is like a bit of a chocolatey
purpley shade which I really lacked as a
blending color makes the eyes look blue
then I'm taking this hot eyeliner it has
a smudge pen on one end so like a softer
eyeliner and then the felt tip on the
other end so I'm taking the smudgy end
and doing like a little bit of a wing
and then I'm going to blend it out with
a flat brush just just mark it out a
little bit because in the further how I
said it looks very smart out now I'm
taking that same brush and smudging it
on the lower lash line just to make it
even more smoky now I'm taking my mac
mineralize skinfinish it runs up the
face so in the cheekbones creating a
shudder and then just on a jawline as
well just to create those shadows she
has quite a sculpted face sir and we
hear a little bit for this but I'm gonna
scope mine out with some bronzer
then I'm taking my Mac soft and gentle
with my finger because I feel like it
applies the best that way and putting it
on my cheekbones my lips turn to my nose
as well as my eyebrow bone just to pop
it out anything you want to make hop out
just a little bit of highlight on I'm
using my all time space better than sex
mascara by two-faced and putting it on
my lashes she's not wearing any false
lashes in the photo so I'm not going to
put any false lashes on she's just caked
her lashes with mascara and now I'm
using the Tarte and because lipstick and
putting on my lips she's got a natural
color sir that's the finished look
thank you guys so much for watching and
I really hope you enjoyed please don't
