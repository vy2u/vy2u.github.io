sunniest day Melvin's hiding awhile
which I'm very happy about did a big
shop ones Apple and I got a whole a
variety of things jumped through to
pieces
swimwear you name it so much return
alone and I'm going to show you guys
what I got so let's get into this video
okay the first thing I got was this cute
ass jumpsuit I'm a medium in pretty much
everything size 10 and this is like a
perfect fit for my four so because I
have quite a long torso as well but at
the top is super stretchy by tightening
around the waist to it that bit of a
snatch such a flattering shape and then
you've got these little tie up arm holds
so this is so cute if I were going out
for lunch or something on a holiday or
just the Chilean Jetta of this summer
this is what I wear it's some little
brown sandals I literally could not go
past this one this is such a cute free
top just literally a denim top and this
is high up around the front it has a bit
more boob room I'm a little bit
flat-chested but it doesn't get too much
so if you have that little bit extra
boob you would be perfect in this top
the sure if it was gonna be like food
quality denim or not but it's pretty
good quality denim I would definitely
definitely wear this with a pair of
white shorts or something like that
anything kind of backless that crosses
over put my name on it straight away
next up I got a couple of t-shirts
because you cannot go wrong with
midriffs and t-shirts in someone I will
live in this top your back
nipples oh my god I will not be wearing
eyebrows hey this one's another t-shirt
that I got just makes me mad photos on
this man
such a cute cough oh my god is love this
awesome qualities to spend with the
other top super good quality nice and
breathable stretchy next is this cute
set I would suggest both size up from
this one if you were going to buy it
because I think I could do with this
size up and the top it doesn't really
matter because you can tie it up so I
think that matters but I would probably
go a large and this but it's stupid to
you I love the colors pink and green
such summery a pitch it does have straps
that you can put in it as well but I
think I would just do it strapless
because I don't really have any groups
maybe if you had very much you could do
it with the straps
or even if you just want to - oh my god
I'm loving everything and the quality of
this isn't true bad it's breathable for
summer it's not thin that you can see
through it it's thick enough either way
I love this so this one is a little
skirt and top set this is such a cute
set I would just wear this over bikinis
because the side you can see through it
kind of material it's very stretchy so
maybe a size down this guy was a little
bit bigger too tight a bit more so
sometimes the sizing can be a bit
different
see what I mean it's like a little bit
bigger maybe it has to go on a waist now
I would definitely wear it high waisted
such cute colors there for me my
favorite colors together ordination
theories
next I got this cute dress and probably
wear this to dinners or chuck it over my
togs
you can also snatch that ways or you can
just wear it whatever you feel
comfortable with but this is quite cute
as well but the price all this stuff is
amazing I'm pretty sure most that this
stuff is like $15 for like a sex for a
dress so absolute bargain and the
shipping time is super quick as well I
got mine within like three days there's
not anything that I'm like I mean that's
really really bad quality that I
couldn't wet this is another little one
that I got this is cute for like a few
drinks or something if you're a landfill
of days it's probably not my favorite
one that I got but it's still quite cute
nice flowy dress so comfy and easy to
wear and there's this little top it has
a little pineapple I'm Nicolas sorry yes
you need a good stable pair of shorts in
summer and good t-shirts oh my god I
love this time it takes me back a few
such a good fit I'm happy with the
quality and the size but love love her
this is so nice this is my favorite cut
on the dress the v-neck the stupid deep
v-neck oh I love this fully backless
you have tried a big tarp yes I tried
it's hotter I wouldn't get that okay
love this one Napa bikinis so these ones
an orangey color as I told you before
I'm obsessed with orange these bottoms
are so comfy I was worried about you
have bottoms kind of squeezed into your
fat well of why I don't do that but I
like the seamless kind of bikini bottoms
and this bikini top super flattering as
well in which area nice on the booty a
you can even g-string it up a little bit
more if you wanted to that's the kind of
advice I gave I got medium sized tending
top and bottoms in all of my swimmer as
well so this is the next bikini that I
got I'm just tightening the size sorry
my fridge just started cooling it full
so you can tighten them I've got a
medium and they fit perfectly these ones
at the bar quite cheeky which I like you
could wear it as a top as well with just
some shorts which is a bonus you get
like two pieces in if you were willing
to wear it at the next when my item is
this one this is the bottoms
and probably goes sized up in the
bottoms because they pushing a little
bit on my sides that's okay I made even
the tops really nice but I'd probably go
a large in the bodies the super cute on
the booty though
spooky knee is this triangle top from
what these beefbottom is so good such a
good fit and the top is really nice as
well I just need to tighten the straps a
little bit but I think you can do that
one he next up I got the same bikini as
the white one like this but in a cocky
kind of color and the bottoms are
adjustable against which is amazing the
flipping a little bit inside up good
buffing that yes or not I love this
style that you commercials I think it
would make a really cute top so this top
is tie up at the front gingham is so in
at the moment this color is so nice
like it if I walk feeds this are
different sir that's the top really cute
and the bottom circu tis well it's a
cheeky on the pro-league are probably
watching the buttons as well and not
like the stretchy material like the
other ones but that is the end of this
whole guys I really appreciate you guys
watching
I bought all of this stuff from as a
fool come I'm seriously really happy
with it a price especially the bikini
stick alike $10 a set which is a bargain
you could not get that anywhere
basically it's like hopes I across let's
be serious I will leave everything in
the description that you need to know
thank you so much for watching this
video and I'll see you next one love you
guys
wait you have to check out my dogs right

have to turn the air con off to do that
video but like hey Bubba look it up
