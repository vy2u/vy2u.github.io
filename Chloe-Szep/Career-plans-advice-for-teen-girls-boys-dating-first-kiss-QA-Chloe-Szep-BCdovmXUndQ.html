finished school it's good I finished
soon I'm darling I'm finished forever
what am I going to do career-wise
after I finish my schooling so I've
decided to go on and do a deployment of
makeup artistry so after I do my course
I think I'm gonna freelance around
Brisbane and I might even move to
sitting in freelance because Sydney's a
better place
residents kind of small out of there if
I could give any advice to
twelve-year-old me what would it be I
guess like everyone at that age is like
finding themselves so like that's
probably the hardest age like there's so
many things that go on in your life like
that age my parents are breaking up so
it made everything 20 times worse your
your weight is fluctuating like you're
changing into a woman your body shape is
changing so I focused on that a lot when
I was 12 well so 12 yeah like 12 to 15
ish you just have to know that your
body's changing into a womanly body
you're not gonna stay you're 12 year old
buddy for the rest of your life there's
just things that you have to accept at
that age around good people support
yourself
don't rely on people to support you you
need to be supporting yourself and
growing yourself as a person and not
relying on other people who do that for
you and there's find things that make
you happy as a person so like instead of
finding other things that make you happy
I used to rely on boys to make me happy
I used to like talk to guys in a black I
love texting him it's that girl he makes
me so happy
my god it's been a day and he hasn't
texted me doctor make you so happy
hang out with your friends they're like
the main thing like those ages the
biggest part is your friends your
friends are like I don't know you'll
find good friends you'll lose friends
you'll fight with friends but you'll
find your best friends I have like one
best friend you're going to find that
one person that you like where this
person's being there from day one
and you'll never leave each other's side
honey so lucky that's my bus what
qualities do I look for in a guy
I don't know I had this tight like I had
a tie I used to have a type it was like
really tall dark football players but I
don't think I have a type anymore
I kind of just like if I like someone I
like someone I like funny people like
outgoing people heck guys that know how
to hold a conversation they have to be
like nice and family-orientated fun talk
that's about it what was the most
interesting date that I've been on I
really been on like a few dates I'm not
really like a date type of person I hate
dates I did go on a dinner date once and
I was that nervous that I took shots of
vodka before it went and I got there and
I was just a little bit tipsy sorry do
not recommend oh that was terrible it
wasn't terrible but oldsters drunk who
was my first kiss and do I still know
them I'm gonna shave him my first kiss
was hi Marshall I was great six I think
I dared to do for like 14 months
oh my god Oh anyway thank you guys so
much for watching I hope you like this
video if you did thumbs up would be nice
yeah let me say that again I'll see you
guys very soon thank you so much for
watching
