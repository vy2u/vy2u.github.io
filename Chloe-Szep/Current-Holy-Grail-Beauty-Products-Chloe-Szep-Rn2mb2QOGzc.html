today's video I'm just going to be
showing you a few of my everyday
favorite makeup products that I use on a
regular basis and probably my favorite
products that I have used so far so I
will just get straight into it so
firstly for my foundation I have been
loving at the moment the NARS all day
luminous weightless foundation in the
shade Stromboli
it works really well for me and I have
been absolutely loving it lately I also
use the esada foundation it's like a
mint a mineral foundation and I got that
recommended by my dermatologist so I use
that I'm just like a day-to-day basis
but I'm not really going anywhere
extreme it covers what it means to cover
and it's not bad for my skin so I do
like that product I just use that in the
shade Miami so they would be my favorite
foundations that I have ever used the
Estee Lauder foundation is really good
for going out because it actually just
stays on your skin and has a really nice
color I use the colour cashew in that
one so it's the double way it's really
good for going out but it does break my
skin out another favorite product to
mine is the NARS Laguna it's like a
matte bronze up all is really good too
but this one's I just started using it
I've just been loving it lately so that
would have to be one of my favorites at
the moment and then for my blush I use
the Asada mineral baked blush again this
one's a mineral and it's good for your
skin and just the color tones are really
nice and like shimmery and illuminating
so I really like that one I've been
using this for like two years and as you
can see hardly any of it has been used
and I use it like every day so that is a
great with your money but I my favorite
favorite favorite mascara would have to
be the Too Faced better than sex I came
across this one like couple years ago
but I hadn't gotten it until like a
month ago and I just love this mascara I
also use the NARS radiant concealer
that's my life man concealer at the
moment it's really good at like
highlights under your eyes as well I use
it in the shade custard so I feel like
I'm doing a bloody look everything
sounds it I just got you to Nina's for
that that's why I've been loving this I
also use the Napoleon perdus prismatic
eyeshadow quad in number four just
because the colors are just so neutral
and basic like blending colors they
usually just use that one in my crease
and this one of my eyebrow burn and
they're just really simple colors I also
used the chichi brow pencil just to line
the outer of my brow and I fill it in
with the elf eyebrow kit which is really
good but I just find it's easy to
outline my eyebrow with a pencil
it just gives them more defined line and
then I usually just go over it with the
gimme brow by benefit they're probably
my main eyebrow products and then for my
lips I use just any kind of lip liner
that I have at the moment I'm using the
Rimmel zero for known natural pink lip
liner which is working well and I also
use like a cheap eyelash curler so does
the trick but yeah they are my favorite
products that I've used in the regular
basis or just purse my little bag here
that I put them in it's just like a
Napoleon get bad I think I hope you
enjoyed this video and I'll see in my
neck
