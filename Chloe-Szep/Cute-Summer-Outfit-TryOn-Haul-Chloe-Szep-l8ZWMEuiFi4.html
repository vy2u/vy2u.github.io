name is Claudette and today's video I
partnered up with princess Polly
boutique to bring you some cool so I do
have a card to you guys if you're
interested in any of the outfits I have
20% off is Chloe 20 you just type it in
to check out and you get a good 20% off
they would enjoy that discount and if
you'd like to see the guys please keep
so the first clothing item that I picked
up was this little bra it's a major
sorry started to wear shorts or a nice
or skirt it's a little bit foggy at the
front
unless you have boobs so I didn't really
feel it in that much but I like the
baggy look it makes it ties up at the
back and it has like a little triangle
and I just wore that one with a black
skirt which I also got from princess
Polly it's the one way denim black wrap
skirt so it literally just buttons up
here and then wrap this part around into
the buckle the next thing I got was this
midriff to can tell the recurring
pattern here midriffs so I do love my me
trips little bit is have you showing us
some short words of you guys but this
literally can have anything I put it
with white shorts like red how a simple
sure one will put in that thing with
like a red I also got this one which is
quite similar a bit longer though so
here's an example of me tying up the
shirt you can wear it in two different
ways so I also had it with program sugar
just to pop the red bits in the shop so
the next clothing item is this long wrap
it's super super comfy and really cute
to go over top so that's how I wore mine
and poor Douglas I just have my one
piece on as you can see right now to
share as well it does have the buttons
down the side where you can do it up and
push it to that which I think will look
really cute as well and then I also go
up this jumpsuit this a denim denim
playsuit short simple - chuckle unlike
if I'm going to the shop stop jumping on
if I'm going out I'll check her and you
can dress it up dress it down this would
look really cute with a pair of brown
sandals and like a brown hat or even
like white sandals to go with the legs I
think that looks so there are the points
that I bought from Princess fully I
literally want everything on their
website so obviously I was limited but
it's really really cute stuff on there
