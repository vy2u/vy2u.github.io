today's video is going to be a one brand
foundation routine I'm going to be
showing you treatment foundations
because one is a stay mat and that
liquid foundation of which I wear on a
night time kind of things to places that
I want full coverage whereas I also use
the BB cream to wear as a lighter
coverage during the day so I'll be
showing you these two foundations the
later on in this video first I'm going
to tell you a bit about the renowned
foundations there's the Rimmel London
the lasting finish foundation this one
has a comfort serum added to it it has
the red lid and this one is just the
regular lasting finish foundation these
ones when I go like shopping or out
somewhere for the day because they last
all day and they are a full coverage
makeup so it's not just what I'm doing
running around things up go shopping but
I'll have the full coverage and it's
also lightweight so it's good for like a
day out as it leaves your skin looking
absolutely full of it I've also been
using the Rimmel London match perfection
foundation because it has really great
colors like there's a lot of colors that
match my skin tone like darker brownish
colors with no pinky highlights in them
and it just gives like a flawless
coverage like under any light importable
goods it's fun so if you guys would like
to see me apply the stay matte liquid
foundation and the BB cream matte
foundation please keep watching I'm just
going through put some on my hand I'm
using the true nude and these stay matte
liquid foundation
when I apply my foundation I prefer to
use a brush rather than my fingers
because it blends a lot like a lot more
flawlessly and it means that any streaks
or uneven areas
also false eyelashes today but I'm in
love with them I've never had them
before and they're actually made it
actually feels like there's nothing on
my oh I'm just going to blend it down my
neck to match my tap
so that's the foundation like on without
any powder or anything and it's quite a
full coverage foundation which I love so
I went I wore this one like out the
other weekend and I slept in my makeup
which is really bad I hate sleeping my
makeup it I didn't even have to like
apply any powder because it just it
stayed matte the whole time that I was
out which is rare for me because I have
quite oily skins good for like a
festival wave and because it's not - I
sweat off shine control it's really like
it's really quite great mother got lip
it's been really great for festival
where the lifetime coverage as I said
before I like to wear the red Mel baby
cream it's a matte BB cream as well so
it doesn't slide off your face but it's
a light coverage so I'm just going to
take this off and show you guys what it
looks like with the BB cream okay I'm
going to be showing you guys the Rimmel
London matte BB cream in the shade
medium
this one is well blends a lot more
flawlessly with a brush rather than
using your fingers brushes just with
every foundation apply a lot better and
even happy liquid that you're putting
onto your face so that's the matte BB
cream it's a nice light coverage but is
also black covers blemishes and pimples
as well as treating them at the same
time I also don't use a powder with this
d-doc you can if you like like a really
really matte but I find that this is
matte enough okay so to finish off the
look because of wearing the BB cream I'm
going for like a light day well look I'm
going to be using the Rimmel London
lasting finish soft color blush in the
shade pink rose and just applying that
to to my cheeks
it just gives a nice natural rosy tinge
to cheeks adding a little bit of color
to your face
I'm then going to go in with the eyebrow
pencil Barbara now in the 0:04 black
brown shade I'm usually the shade
lighter than this but today I'm going to
be using this car I just lightly butter
and then I'm also going to be using the
Rimmel Kate lipstick in the shade 1:03
so it's your nice
the blush the lipstick and the eyebrow
pencil that I used up all the Rimmel I
just wanted to use them to finish off
the book in addition to the liquid
foundation and the little lighter J
where the BB cream which I'm wearing at
the moment so I hope you guys enjoyed
this foundation routine video and please
don't hesitate to leave comments about
foundations below and I will hopefully
get back to you and answer the questions
that you have asked and thank you so
much for watching I shall see you in my
