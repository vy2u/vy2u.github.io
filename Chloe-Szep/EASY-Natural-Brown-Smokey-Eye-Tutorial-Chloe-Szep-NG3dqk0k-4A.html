today's video is a makeup tutorial but
before I get into it I'm just going to
tie my hair into a bun so that it
doesn't get in the way it whilst I'm
doing my makeup I then always cleanse my
skin in preparation for my foundation
i'm just using the Cetaphil gentle
gentle gentle cleanser
so for my face i'm using the loreal true
match in the Mac one to seven brush I
prepped my face with the mac fix+
spray as well as a moisturizer although
I'm these steps in the filming process
all right guys
I then go ahead with the Mac Studio Fix
powder and the mac-11 secret brush and
just Pat it along my face so that the
product doesn't mirror weight
for some reason I always tend to jump
straight on to my eyes
anyway I'm using the bare minerals
blending brush as well as the Mac
mineralize skinfinish in the shade dark
mist so I'm just blending this shade
into my crease to create a bit of a
shadow
I then blend the color out towards my
temples just to create a bit of a shadow
of my temple and move a bit of the
product up
and then taking the Mac Paint Pot in
chilled on ice and using that on my lid
to create a bit of a sparkly babe and
then I put a Goldy color on the top of
that it just helps the product stick a
bit better because it's more liquidy
than powdery so taking the shade caramel
on my true face chocolate bar palette
and using the Napoleon concealer brush
to Pat that on
using the mac eyeliner pencil in Costa
reach I'm just creating the triangle in
the outer corner of my eyes making sure
that I get the whole outer corner
and then using my Mac 239 brush to blend
that out it's really easily smudge able
which is why I love this pencil
taking the bare mineral blending brush
again as well as the doc deepest skin
finish I'm just going to read through
that crease out towards my temples as
well and just blend it all out
taking the concealer brush as well as
the mac prolongwear concealer I'm just
going to conceal under my eyes I don't
go too far down because it goes quite
muddy as you go down the cheek so I just
stick to where I'm a little bit dark
around the eyes and blend that out
I'm just taking my mac studio fix powder
again and popping that under my eye I
don't do the whole highlighting thing
under my eye I just conceal and do the
basic thing I find it works better on me
taking my Mac 239 brush and also the
truffled color in the chocolate bar
palette I'm just going to create a
shudder under my eye it opens the eye
right up to do the inner corner of my
eye I use the Mac to 1-9 brush and soft
and gentle by Mac it just brings out
your eyes
saw so much then taking the Mac
fluidline for our gel cream in
dirty-blond and my Mac 263 brush and
just going along the top of my lash line
and then using the same on my eyebrows
it's actually meant for brows but I do
use it for my lash line as well
then taking my NARS contour brush and
dark deepest once again I'm just
contouring my cheeks and bronzing up my
forehead I do like a three shape around
my face then taking my soft and gentle
and the mac-11 six brush and
highlighting my cheekbones Cupid's bow
chin nose forehead and under my eyebrows
my all-time favorite mascara about to
face the better than sex mascara I'm
just going to apply that a little bit
just before I had Chuck my lashes on yes
I'm just using the I spire by Daniel
manhood II in flat for my eyelashes
today that's so so easy to apply and so
light love them well done to any feet
and then on to my lips using the nude
awakening Napoleon Paris lipliner then
for my lip gloss I just use Walpole
pointment it literally works the best
for me and it always has and it works is
like a gloss and finally take my hair
out to complete the look I hope you guys
enjoyed this look please give it a
thumbs up if you like me doing makeup
tutorials so that I have a bit of an
idea and I'll see you in my next video
