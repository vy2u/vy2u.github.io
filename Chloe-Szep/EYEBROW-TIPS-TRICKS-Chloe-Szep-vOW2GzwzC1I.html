like a bit of a spur my bro hi guys
welcome back to my channel today's video
I'm just going to be doing Alex's
eyebrows to give a bit of a tutorial on
how I fill in eyebrows I feel like it's
a good thing to know I browser like the
main feature and Alex doesn't know how
to do her eyebrows so I thought perfect
opportunity to show you guys end Alex
how to do it you can just go back re
watch it I know how to do it there so
I'm just going to zoom in on Alex's face
and fill in her eyebrows I just Condor
into buying the Revlon Colorstay eyebrow
line up it's in the color blonde this is
the pencil I used before I got my
eyebrows tattooed on and con my sister
into buying in as well because I feel
like it's just a good creamy easy to use
pencil so let's just get straight into
filling her eyebrows in ok so now I have
this up close and personal the way I
like to start with filling in my
eyebrows is like brushing them I'm
making sure they're all hairs are all
going the same way and then I start at
like the peak of the eyebrow so I just
got around the edge of the eyebrow first
just um like this so I've extended her I
Brad down to like where her I am I wax
your eyebrows about three years ago okay
i waxed half of her eyebrow off so bad
memories yes so here I am three years
later fixing it up a pencil I'm just
going to go I'm dark yeah she's gonna be
the bald patch there from you so I'll
just um pencil that in but just going
outside the shape of the eyebrow and
then get towards there fri to the
eyebrow I don't like going through dark
because its bets like ombre into the end
I don't know the end should just be the
darkest
I've just outlined just the out of her
eyebrows I basically made a shape that
we can go and fill in this is the fun
part and then you can just go into the
eyebrow and fill it in you can do this a
powder like powder works really well
with this as well but today we're just
using what we have which is when I focus
the camera on my making funny faces so
let's have a look at the difference
right now shall we yeah all right alex
is going to go in and try and do her out
when I eyebrow we need a mirror here um
my phone case perf like cooked road case
where he started at the tail yep extend
the tail out she's never used a pencil
to fill in her eyebrows so here's a few
lessons like that yes exactly like that
now um sorry w here yeah this bit yeah
make a bit of an outline yeah and just
keep going in the dirt you're too dark
for Miss Jake everyone makes when
they're at this end I do it a bit too
dark and it just looks like a bit of a
sperm eyebrow with the circle here and
then the anyway are you going I'm kind
of just coloring it in but show me yeah
that looks good how do you feel about
that um your eyebrows like it might be
different as well so I feel I like your
own a lot better if you know how your
eyebrow cakes here yeah just so I can
make it a bit more square just really
lightly though no luck here where I
right let's see how that this guy's like
peak just like PQ brow
pick it up pick it like a mountain tip I
got this yes you can where's my cake
here um just stop here so like yeah just
so with you with your teeth you want to
make that bit more flat make about like
a little dot there so tip it there go
down and then match that to like this
eyebrow is completely different to her
other one it's because you wax half this
one off so we're growing back that one's
better I know why but this one's just a
bit more furry i'm just going to square
that off like a dislike the other one
like that but I'll beautiful I don't
know practice makes perfect you'll get
it like you like it yeah do I below to
whittle would you say don't know how i
feel about this pencil really yeah
sometimes um to be clay I haven't used
it for a while but it kind of breaks a
little bit her um you just have to use
it really softly like you can't go
pelting down otherwise it's just gonna
snap not snap but like a clay off with
eyebrows it should like pikia go down
here and match here and then this should
be in line with i'm pretty sure it's
your nostril my let me see no
or it's like where your lip is or your
nostril I don't know Oh google it but
yeah I know it Peaks here like where
your pupil is and then it ends like
where your eye like if you do this it
should specifically end there so yeah
that's the eyebrow lesson we have
presented to you today presented by
Khloe and Alex so I hope you guys found
