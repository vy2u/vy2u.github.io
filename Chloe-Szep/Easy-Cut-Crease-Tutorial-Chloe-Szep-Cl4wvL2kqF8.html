finally a makeup video finally I haven't
done one in so long because I haven't
had my lighting and I think that makeup
videos would look so much better with
lighting because you can hear it a lot
more and etc so I decided today to do a
previous tutorial because I promise you
guys on Instagram that I would and I
also got my lighting today not my ring
light yet but my two soft boxes so it
gave me enough light to complete this
merging are so if you'd like to see this
tutorial please keep watching
okay so firstly I'm going to be grabbing
up my Mac dock deepest mineralized
skinfinish bronzing powder so I'm going
to just be putting it above the crease
create a shadow and so that it's not as
harsh when I'm blending
so I'll just plug that right there
when I'm doing my eyes I don't really
mind about the full app because I come
in with concealer later and patch it all
up going all the way into that you know
I'm then going to grab my Napoleon
purtis number four quad and use the
shave in the bottom left corner to
create a more defined crease just using
a Coastal Scents now it's time for the
hard part so I'm just going to grab a
black eyeshadow so I'll just be using
the balm Rockstar face palette and using
the shade the stroke the brush we'll be
using is just a Napoleon Curtis brush
that I show define our and blend out
it's a two-in-one brush and I'll just be
using the thinnest end and then going to
hold the brush upwards and took my head
back so that I can see where my creases
just above where my eye opens is where
I'm going to start the cut crease and
then going to just start blending up so
what when you've got the brush tilt it
up it'll blend for you a lot easier and
then going to grab my Mac to two full
brush and just put that above the black
line so that I can blend it off and you
just want to point that up towards the
end of your brow I'm going to grab a
brown shade again the same Napoleon one
and just use that on top of the black to
create blended line
and then I'm going to grab an eyeline if
it's just a Rimmel London waterproof eye
definer and I'm just going to go under
where I first started and just draw a
line like so I'm just going to grab a
brush to smoothen out the blended and
get the brown color again
and with the Napoleon Paradis brush that
I fast reach I'm just going to go back
see how it goes like that up to my brow
and now for the base of the eye I'm just
going to use a matte color because I
think that matte on a cut crease looks
better than a shimmery color but you can
do like a neutral shimmery color say
like like that color would look good or
that color would even look good but
today I'm just going to do a nice matte
color so I'm just going to be grabbing
the cord again and using this color and
I'm just going to use my fingers so
that's as you can do it as it can be
that is how I do my cut crease I'm going
to add a liquid eyeliner it's up to you
whether you want to do it or not you
don't have to do it but today I'll just
add it in just in case you guys want to
see what it looks like with the liquid
eyeliner so I'm just going to be using a
Rimmel eyeliner today so starting from
the outer you just want a fuller under
there
you can extend it out as far as you want
to so that's how far I'm going to go out
and I'll just do a little bit of
by the way I'm not very good at liquid
eyeliner so just bear with me I'm still
practicing but you get the drift that is
the look I was going for I'm just going
to finish up under the eye so I'll just
go in with the black color using a flat
top brush so Suns Mac 2 1 2 s II then
I'm going to grab the Napoleon number 4
palette and use the brown shade in the
corner again and just grab a flattened
brush then apply that under as a
transition color
now time for mascara use the Too Faced
better than sex in the sky
lastly I'm just going to grab my Naz
radiant creamy concealer in the shade
custard and just put it under my eye
I'm also going to finish my bronzing and
contouring and by blush I just took one
side of my face that is what the eye
turned out looking like I'm going to go
into my highlighting and contouring Nasr
I will be back with the finished look
