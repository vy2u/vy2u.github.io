welcome back to my channel today's video
is my updated tanning routine so
throughout this video I'm going to be
showing you how I take 10 the prepping
stages some tips and tricks and going
into more depth about tanning so if
you'd like to see that and please keep
watching the self-care that I have used
and I've been using religiously to use
is the bunga sans self-tanning farm in
dark I always do stock because I'm quite
actually can but I don't want to talk
about my channe I just a little bit of
dark farm on the old docks for me is a
little bit too dark still love the open
that if I was going through an event
that I needed to be super dark book was
perfect for that
but for weekly users I'm going somewhere
I'll just stick with the dark so this is
what my tanning routine looks like I
usually leave my fans out a week and I
fish and then it starts to get a little
bit crusty in verse i exfoliate all of
that off on a black a Thursday night
probably ready for the weekend and then
I shave my legs I always shave after I
exfoliate otherwise to get those ugly
little dots and you don't want that just
ruins the whole tan
the good thing about bonsai is that it
doesn't come off gross mine usually just
fades and then I end up having to just
exfoliate it a little bit because if I
apply another layer it then starts to go
a little bit yuck if I still have
leftover turn on from the week before
but I just a bond masked and exfoliating
a glove I swap my hand into it and just
do circular motions on my leg
so what I've explained it and shaved my
legs I then put some sorbolene cream on
my dry patches which is usually my elbow
or weenus if you call it that and also
my knees eight and palms of my hands
because start to the places that tend to
cling to the dry patches
it arctan my face since I have
super-sensitive skin so when I do turn
my face I break that and it's not me to
the Bondi I just break out to every
single product that is put on my face so
I leave my face looking away and once I
put the Silberling cream or any sort of
moisturizer on my dry patches I go in
with the pad and I usually do one quart
depending around on if I'm going to an
event surrounding three quite dark or
special occasions and I do two coats and
usually it goes very dark
I tend to sleep in my tan which is it
gross but they are only developed to a
certain level and usually when I can
it's at nighttime so I can't be bothered
washing it off at like 3:00 in the
morning so I just leave it on all night
and then once I get up I just rinsed it
off so don't use any for the chemicals
or stuff when you're washing your hands
into a quick old rinse and then jump out
a shower
dab yourself with your child once you
have a shower the next time intamin uses
so what should you bet
that's pretty much what I do for my
tanning routine every Thursday or
whenever I use tan I really hope you
guys enjoyed this video and you got a
little bit of information out of it that
you can take back with you and use and I
will see you in my next video thank you
so much for watching have a lovely day
trash nut bye guys
please showing you the days that I can't
no I'm not going to show you the days
when I usually leave my pan about a week
and a half fish and it's hot and then I
get out of the shower obviously you're
going to stay in the shop gonna happen
