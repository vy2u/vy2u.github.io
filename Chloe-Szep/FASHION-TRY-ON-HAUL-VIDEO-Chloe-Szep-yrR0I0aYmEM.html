today's video is one that I absolutely
love filming and have it done in a while
so I teamed up with white for preteen
boys shop on their website one of my
grocery websites when I'm like looking
for cloris and looking some basic stuff
just to where I'm going to run you guys
through everything that I got and show
you how I've worked let that show into
this video I'm so excited to show you so
I'm going to start this video with some
nighttime outfits and just all of like
outfits that I bought this skirt was
probably the best thing that I got in
this video because it just matches every
single thing that I also got like top
life a short a line skirt I wrote it in
a size small it's black it's simple it's
versatile it's definitely a basic that
you can pair with every single thing in
your wardrobe so I've had this skirt
with this stunning body through kendall
Jenner wore similar one I think
everyone's kind of copied what you did
and so obsessed with it anything or the
DP I absolutely love I've got this
little satin carry with the light at the
top if this good as well and the high
knee boots this is such a basics that
you need and you need in your wardrobe
you can wear this with everything I
always have and when to put a leather
jacket over the top of this with some
jeans and boots I also have this
gorgeous top it is such a nice night
home top because you wear your bra your
black bra under it or a bralette and all
the dialogue thieves just make it
shimmer look like a space all the stuff
I then got this sequin S skirt so to you
for the night time as well anything
black with a little bit of bling on it
it's okay for nighttime it just stands
out so much
these are got 12 in black and white
beggar with everything this are handy to
have in your wardrobe just to chuckle
with jeans or skirt or shorts or
anything
that they're not for some more day we're
kind of white clearance IP - bodysuit
this body suit goes with seriously
everything it's such a versatile basics
that you just need in your cupboard I
append this on with an awesome green
skirt the green skirt I paired it with
were a bit past my knee and it came with
like a matching shirt but you can swap
all these sort of things up so the
beauty with buying basics is that you
can swap it up with heaps of different
things that you have this amazing body
suit goes with everything again anything
Wyatt I'm obsessed with this color at
the moment if you go on my Instagram
right now I've so many photos in this
khaki color it's backless and it sits
perfectly at the front not to reload not
too high and it's good because I have a
very long torso and this one doesn't
pull on my bum you know some of them you
have to kind of do - because this are
tired of your bum this won't even have
to do that I bought them I thought ten
in it just so the torso it would be a
little bit longer and I paired up with
these dress shop so really fun fling at
the waist and then they go a little bit
looser at the thigh and the bottom
author of a basic all these quotable
basics a black and white and then also
got the dresses and granny stuff put the
basics all would pick over the next
piece of coordinate that I got this is
so so cute
probably my my favorites that I bought
you can pair it with some slides I got
these black slides they're called the
riders fire or if you'd like to dress it
up new tools and lastly I got this myth
it's the one that's it is shorter at the
back and one grip up front you can wear
it off the shoulder and I've had with
this stunning sequined skirt
this is so not rejoice on any sort of
outfit when you're going out at night
very cold at the moment die but yeah I
absolutely love this gun so preman blab
pictures and the last dress that I have
such a pretty dress and sorry what glam
glam gun gun it has little sparkles all
over it or even that time you can use
glim off and stand out with nothing else
