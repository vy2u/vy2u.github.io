fake turning routine very highly
requested this one so please enjoy so
the night before I faked an I like to
thoroughly exfoliate and shave my skin
and then moisturize this will ensure
that there's no dry patches that my tan
can cling to I just used the natural
instinct Body Wash it's just a natural
paraben free body wash
true get my tan off and this mitt you
can buy from any supermarket it's great
so I just put that one on and put a few
squirts of Body Wash into my palm
I then go ahead and thoroughly rub my
skin in circular and up and down motions
making sure that I'm using enough force
to remove the tan
and when you watch the glove you should
see all of the ten weaving out of the
glove and then the next day I pick which
ten I'm going to use I have two turns of
which I love I use the black magic argan
oil one as well as bondage sands it just
depends on the day and the occasion on
which one that I will use today I am
going with my black magic to our ten it
is the one that they used to spray on
you but I to supply it with a met it
turns out the same and it will look
darker after it's developed so I'm just
going to open the lid and pour a little
bit onto my thundersense cloth and then
apply it to the other region of my body
my chest and
just try to blend it as thoroughly as
possible because most tents do dry
pretty quickly and leave some streaks so
make sure that you are doing it fairly
quickly
time for the legs which is what I like
to be the darkest so please don't get a
fright when you see how much product I'm
using
how does it go you can't turn it tenet
so that is the end of my fake tanning
routine I usually just get like my mom
or my sister to do my back and I'm
finished but of course I do have to put
a robe on in case someone comes to the
door or something so I'm just wearing my
little tanning robe and I'll wrap that
around myself keeps me warm and it
protects the tent and doesn't let any of
it rub off this is me just being
extremely happy that I finished fake
tanning because it is such a chore so
thank you so much for watching I hope
you enjoyed and I'll see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
