gel cleanser with my vanity planet
stinks perfect skin works so well and
cleaning out my pores I use it like
twice a day good morning usually before
I put makeup on and in the afternoon
when I'm blending my makeup off it just
keeps my skin the vanity planet also
comes with a large exfoliating brush and
I use that to scrub my channel so you'll
probably see this one in my tanning
routine when I do the updated one sure I
do have a card for the vanity planet the
code is Chloe's up and it'll be linked
in my description if you'd like any more
information so everything will be listed
in my description all the products that
I've used this one's the hydrating mist
from Mac and then the crowning ceremony
so for my face I use the Mac Studio Fix
fluid in shade NC 30 I got this before I
went to ballet so it's a little bit
darker than my skin as my Bali tan has
faded I'm not gonna lie I always seem to
come back to my Mac foundations
I'll try other foundations but they're
just not as good as Mac I love the color
shades that Mac has this one is like a
more yellow based foundation which I
prefer rather than any other sort of
foundation so then I'm just going to go
in with my Mac Studio Fix powder and set
my foundation blue-eyed people who trust
me when I say using orange action and
makes your blue eyes stand out so so
much I have been using orange eyeshadow
for a long time and I just can't seem to
go back from it I always put it in my
crease usually I use the peanut butter
shade on the Too Faced chocolate bar
palette or tequila sunrise by a Napoleon
furnace then my true favorite orange
shades and then usually I darkened my
crease with any sort of brown shade
and then my lid I use the Mac paint but
in the shade children ask and it just
creates a nice shimmer on my lid
not always tend to jakka my crease as I
go through my make and then I take the
crease color underneath my eye and it
makes my eyes a bigger than they are
and then straight onto my eyebrows
because I need to lengthen this baby to
match that with my eye shadow are
usually lengthen it to the corner of my
eye and just darken them up a little bit
I do have eyebrows how doing so my shape
just stays how it usually looks I just
tend to darken it off then I'm going in
with my Too Faced concealer again the
products will be listed below so during
stress and then I just blend it out with
like a little
and to set the concealer I use my banana
shade from the straw then I go straight
on to my clone tool I'm using an oz
brush here it's a really precise brush
and I just blend out the bronze off and
then I put on my temples and on my
forehead and also on my jawline just
took her spot my face
so excuse me while you watch me have a
bit of trouble putting my eyelashes on
they were very light and flimsy sir I'm
used to heavier eyelashes but they ended
up going on in the end sir
and then to cut the lash line I just put
on some eyeliner some liquid eyeliner
the toothpaste one so it so easy to use
the felt tips I would recommend if
you're new to doing eyeliner and that's
the finished product thank you guys so
much for watching I really hope you
enjoyed this video and please give it a
thumbs up if you did
card for the vanity planet will be in my
description as well as all the products
that I used in this video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
