another vlog today I'm going to Drake
concert tonight so I'm so excited
Drake's which they're one of my favorite
artists ever sir I'm just gonna film my
get ready with me you guys can watch me
get ready okay so I just prepped my skin
I put my pimple cream on then I put a
hydrogel on a moisturizer and I don't
usually use province but you can use
primer if you do use primates and you
feel like they work for you go relax I'm
going to mix a couple of our nations
together today I'm going to use my Tarte
a rainforest of the sea because I'm
really loving this at the moment
and so my Estee Lauder Double Wear
I haven't yet done it before but we'll
see how it turns out so I'm just using
medium tense and in the taught then
Wratten in the Estee Lauder see how he's
carried to get
they're like a perfect color match I
might just put a little bit of this in
the top to get that extra coverage ya
feel me
well that's a lot of my card I'm going
to be using my tart shape tape in medium
just under my earth
I was gonna use the smaller end of this
brush to buff it in I'm so excited for
Drake they should cut him in the scribe
I know probably every song so I just put
it up onto my noise just so it slims my
notes a little bit the light of color so
sorry about the light changing its
because it's afternoon in the light
going from like really light to a little
bit normal like shady in the space of
like five seconds we shouldn't do that
but what can I do like I'm just going to
use my Laura Mercier translucent powder
and up my eyes and just set
oh is that a doggie that I see
high-roller
Lola come Ebola oh she flips straight
onto her back come here
you pieces tie hello hey don't you I
don't you Lola
a little schwa focused area I feel like
a lot of people will ask she's cute and
she's like 17 weeks about four months
old
lovey she's so beautiful she's such a
little cuddly puppy now I'm just going
to use the Napoleon lettuce camera
finished powder foundation this should
get rid of any flashback views it's a
camera finish one the same as mac studio
finish usually gets rid of flashback
because it is a specific the camera
specific powders for cameras Oh fun fact
I'm going to go straight in with my
bronzer deep in dark deepness by Mac
it's one of the mineralized skinfinish
yes a lot of people have the visit the
guinea son but I feel like this is a
little bit more dark maybe give me some
stock but they're different shades I
feel like this is more Brown than orange
sorry in my last video I got asked to do
a little bit more makeup stuff so that's
why I wanted to film this get ready with
me so that I can give you a little bit a
taste of good makeup
yes that's not going to be too
extravagant over-the-top just because I
am just going to a continent and I don't
really want a full makeup I just want
standard makeup but I think I'm gonna do
an everyday makeup tutorial as well as a
nighttime makeup tutorial for you guys
when I do my clients I usually set under
their eyes and
then I do the eye shadow but that's if
I'm doing like a heavy look just so the
fallout I can just wipe it away with the
laura mercier translucent I'm using
luminous are in milano best blushes so
pretty this color they love it I know
but I'm like a messy fan of blush
and then I just do a little wing with
brown eyeshadow it just isn't as harsh
as a black shadow sir and I feel like my
face or no I've done somebody looks on
my face and I always go back to just a
natural plain look I feel like I suit
that the most so I just wing it that up
then I'm going to take my morphe
blending brush and I'm just going to use
my Inglot I don't know what shades these
are and they're really hard I know this
one's three three five I'm literally
just gonna go in my crease just that and
take it out maybe a tiny bit more just
to give your eyelid some depth me yes
just like sorry and I'm gonna take that
one underneath as well hi Lola I know
I'm filming if you want to say hey my
mate oh the mole come in I'm gonna go
onto my brow because I don't look at
brows I'm using the taut medium brown
well it's very dark my tattooing is
fading so much I haven't had them done
in like a year so I fully have to draw
my eyebrows in this is the Too Faced
better than sex mascara it is better
than sex I was trying to like contour my
nose but it never works because I have a
big nose and it's like kind of bumpy but
let's give it a try I'm at one otherwise
you'll have a shimmery nose now I'm
going to take the who don't beauty 3d
highlight appellate this is to die old
this one's amazing
well
my camera is about to run out of space
so I'm ready for a concert I'm just
wearing this little top it's actually a
belt but I manage about her today and I
was looking for a top and I saw this and
I was like what can I do with that maybe
I could make it into a top so it's
actually meant to be about corset belt I
made it into a top then these added us
parents and my Gucci shoes I did a red
lip for something a little bit different
today but I think really liked it I love
