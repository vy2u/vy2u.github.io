channel so as you can tell I'm back got
my beanie on because Melbourne is
freezing at the moment so I thought why
not do a video that is how to get back
on track after holiday because I
struggle with getting back on track so
bad so I'm going to challenge myself and
do a video to get back on track
but as soon as I usually wake up I have
a lemon water just because I feel like
it Detox's me and after all the crap I
ate on holidays I need that detox first
thing I'm going to do is start the day
with like a healthy breakfast some lemon
water lots of water because after flying
you get so dehydrated as you can tell my
fruit bowl is a little bit sad and bare
but we have lemons remember lemon that's
not for you probably thinks it's a ball
so I'm going to cut this in half and put
half a lemon in each glass squeeze it
and put warm water with it
mmm-hmm good yeah didn't I just scallops
before I eat so that like just cleanse
me cleanse the body and then I'll have a
good break II literally have so much
washing to catch up on because Mitchell
doesn't know how to wash it doesn't want
to learn third I have about two years
worth of washing to catch up on Thanks
sorry sorry I'm gonna make tip number
one start your day healthy as soon as
you get back so not a week later when
you feel like you're better as soon as
you get back from your holiday start
your day with a healthy break and I hope
you mindset because that's the only way
you're going to get back into it if you
do it straight away go to the gym make
sure you have a healthy first day
because if you drag it out the more you
drag it out blade it the longer it's
gonna take to get back into motivation
the are you gonna feel it's the
first day back lemon water healthy
brekkie gym let's do this sorry for
breakfast all we have in the cupboard is
eggs and like baked beans because
somebody's you can do the shopping so
I'm just gonna excreme' dates and some
bike bangs buy things really high in
protein yep and protein as well so
double protein with a cop before I do a
workout thank you very much
you
all right so my eggs are cooked but
before I have my breakfast I'm going to
have this herbal tonic I went to my
naturopath because of my homers and she
said to have this twice a day because it
calms your hormones down and all my
period at the moment so I love that I
know when I'm on my period I'm actually
a nightmare like I just get angry at
stupid and I'm just an angry person
when I'm on my period and emotional sir
tastes like crap but it does the job so
I'm sure I can suck it up for like three
seconds of my life after I have it I
don't breathe out of my nose I just
because otherwise I can taste it so like
if you want to do a shot of something
hold your nose because you right taste
it unless you breathe out of your nose
just a minute that's how bad it is it's
literally the worst thing ever but I can
feel myself getting hormonal and I
really don't want to take it out of
Mitch so like is it worth it
drink up doesn't this look in trouble
honestly I can't live with that sauce on
my eggs have two halves awesome pretty
much everything so a little bit about
the sauce George yeah that's a
that's good answer yeah you've already
eaten buddy back away back away back
away back away so as you can tell a
fridge is extremely bad at the moment I
just threw everything out that was in
here because we hadn't really done a
good shop since we first moved in which
was like a month ago so I threw
everything out that we had and I'm going
to go shopping now and do and have a
healthy shopping before I go I'm going
to have a kombucha because it's
super good for your gut health and
mitchell is obsess in the mirror him say
tastes like a healthy be tired you love
the morning sun every day who sits here
till like 1:00 p.m. and then he slowly
gets up and starts the day you really
like your parents bit of a slow starter
buddy so i just wanted to have a little
chat about just about like food
intolerances and that sort of stuff
because i've got my results back from a
test idea which tells you what you're
intolerant tube and it affects my moods
so much like I have the most sensitive
what would you call it I don't even know
have the most sensitive mood to foods
that I'm eating so if I'm eating bad
food my mood is really bad which is like
sir because I love bad food but it
motivates me to eat better because I
don't want to be feeling but this
test I did told me that I was intolerant
'true wait peanuts and chickpeas I eat
peanut butter probably every day of my
life before I go to the gym I always
have like the gluten free piece of toast
with peanut butter and banana so
I'm gonna struggles I'm gonna struggle
so much I don't want to feel
anymore but now that I'm home I'm just
so glad that I can get back into routine
and cut out the foods that are making me
feel sick so that I can feel better and
so they don't play with my hormones and
my mood and my acne especially like my
pimples are so bad from I think it's
from eating I always thought it was
hormonal which I'm tipping it kind of is
a little bit hormonal I do have my
period at the moment but like majority
is probably food because I'm eating
wheat and I'm eating peanuts everyday
causes in diet like digestion problems
it causes acne bloating mood changes
mood swings so like it's so important to
know what your stomach and what your
body can't handle eating because affects
literally every single thing well I'm
gonna go into holes and it's got my
grocery shop it's like I'm eight
it looks like I'm drinking a beer right
now like it's a cop's that passed and I
went there probably like that girl be
drinking a beer
I could shove this section for ever I
literally just love reading the labels
on the back and seeing what's in food
but like Snuggie food
I could crucially shop for al but I
finished grocery shopping I've got my
first section here I got this very
measly Jesus it's a hundred percent
oranges only and I always read the back
just to make sure so ingredients
orange orange juice 100 percent pumpkin
seeds chia seeds I've got some panitch
Auklet almonds I got some bacon because
I love bacon some sausages for dinner
just as something different so I'm just
gonna do like sausages mashed sweet
potato corn and some broccolini and then
I've got free-range chicken no added
hormones because don't want to add any
more hormones to the hormones I already
have let's be serious now I've got
gluten and wheat free pasta if I ever
make like a pasta dish eggs and this
bread is gluten free weight free milk
free in the fridge I tend to chop up
like my strawberries my broccoli usually
my pumpkin intellect squares because
that's usually how I eat it I'm going to
make my lunch
what should I make
I like them a bit better so I just added
some capsicum and chicken breasts to my
sari I added a little bit of beef stock
with chilli garlic and lemon and I just
put it over my chicken and I'll probably
like stir the veggies into it sure to
give it a bit of flavor and then that'll
go on top of the lettuce and avocado and
feta okay so I'm just going to sprinkle
agar cheese on the top
oh my god bbyong and also some lemon
juice and it's done and I'm so excited
to eat oh my god sorry about that I just
was on the phone to my sister for like
two hours we were just catching up on
