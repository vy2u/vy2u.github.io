name is Chloe's a Piznarski and today
I'm doing a question and answer video
let's just get straight into answering
some questions the first question is my
plans for this year but my plans for
this year hopefully I'm wanting to make
just Sydney some time this yeah it just
depends when I get a job and yeah that's
pretty much all it depends on is when I
get a job so as soon as I get a job or
put we move to Sydney and start my
career there I really want to do
something to do with media and
entertainment and I just feel like
that's what I've always wanted to do and
yeah if I can get a job in that I'll
move straight to Sydney
well that linked to my dream job growing
up weirdly enough my dream job going up
one time to get a dream job growing up
with paramedicine I even picked up
migrating subjects for paramedicine and
I didn't even end up doing it so what is
my worst fear
my worst fear has always been getting
abducted since I was younger I've always
just been like never walk anywhere by
myself in South LA the biggest fear of
getting abducted this question has been
asked so much how did I meet Mitchell we
met on Instagram I just started spending
his photos never really thought anything
that would come out of it we're just
like direct messaging for a bit and then
we started texting and that's it and
then like months later he had a stopover
at Brisbane Airport on his way back to
Melbourne and I was going to Sydney so
we just cool up and then I think like a
week after that I went to Melbourne for
a few days
met the fam that's so soon
second time meeting him I meet with it
yeah I just said in his house and pretty
much how it happened dealing with a
long-distance relationship sorry Mitch
this Melbourne I live in Brisbane we're
doing long-distance being a
relationships need to me let alone like
long-distance so it's been pretty hard
and when you like someone I thought you
just want to spend heaps of time at them
but I said I'll do that when I am
Brisbane and he's in Melbourne so yeah
it's pretty hard but let me see them
it's quality time together so it's worth
it do you have tutors and what do they
mean I have two tattoos I have one on my
sternum
I thought that one in Bali that doesn't
mean anything I just kind of got it
because I liked it I've also got this
one for my back it's my parents
birthdate in Roman numerals and my
sister I break out that it's very much
troduce advice on being confident in
yourself I would just say instead of
looking in the mirror itself and
thinking about it negatives just point
out with positives and focus more on
positives and negatives and just
remember that nobody's perfect and what
you see in social media isn't exactly
100% people they only really put their
highlight reels and that then I'm going
to show you the bad on social media so
just always remembering that and yeah
just first are the positives and
hopefully can help you with your
confidence so that's all for this
question and answer video it's just kind
of like a quick Q&amp;amp;A to let you eat on
doctor you want to know about me it's
the main stuff that people were asking
so I just kind of sectioned it together
I hope you guys enjoyed this video and
if you like question and videos please
give it a thumbs up and I'll see you in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
