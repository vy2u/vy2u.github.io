and this is my sister Amy and welcome
back to my channel we're just going to
discuss a topic that's pretty close to
home for both of us or has been in the
past and that I'm sure a lot of you guys
are dealing with at the moment or have
dealt with before so throughout the
years of my teenage years weight has
been a massive flag what is it like a
interruption everything yeah it's a big
issue that we've both had to go through
I went through first me being older yeah
and then Chloe experienced some of the
stuff that I experienced yeah so Amy
went through first we both went through
a lot of binge eating and I guess when
you hit a stage when you become a
teenager you keep like I guess it's
around 40 and your body starts to change
start getting more curves yeah turning
into more of a woman and I kind of
freaked out about it I was like oh my
gosh my body's changing I'm putting on
white thighs getting bigger on my bums
getting bigger and then you just get
bigger and you're like like yeah you're
going to full panic mode and you just
you try to control your weight so so
much yeah and that becomes like your
main sort of focus and the more you
focus on it the worse it gets
it's a massive deal especially for
adolescents
I hit a stage in life or else I think
mom and dad were broken up and I was
looking to control something in my life
and I didn't really like my body at the
time so I've started binge eating and
that became a continuous cycle I'd binge
eat and then I'd compulsive exercise to
try and burn off that be in singe and
then the next day I'd try and stab
myself but I don't deserve to eat this
morning I ate way too much last night
and then that night again I'd just feed
myself with
and the bad part was I do wake up buying
wanna be really good so I'm not gonna
eat anything bad and your growth will be
like I've done really low like I haven't
eaten that much and then it's not time
you beat that hunger that you just got
overboard and it just like a side and
control it either and just see it
happens over and over until and you
can't get rid of it by physical I want
to stop how did I stop it
no I think it was just a stage and luck
and the thing is Merce girls turn to
diet pills which I know I did and I
wanted some pretty heavy ones that
obviously I didn't need to go because I
wasn't overly I wasn't obese or anything
but I felt like always being myself and
I'm thinner and healthier than I ever
have been not being on there yeah like I
think they just make it worse because
you wait till own facial lose it and
then you're going straight back you
getting double yeah yeah it's just that
diet pills are not the answer I may
affect your marriage and like we fought
with mom a lot look at that top I think
every girl goes through their own
experience of it I am with social media
these days you know the most amazing
models and Photoshop girls all the time
and you just like why can't like that
yeah like we compare ourselves to others
especially ones that we see you know
magazine covers or you know social media
and you know then people might not
necessarily look as good as that in
personal you know it's a lot of
airbrushing and yeah they're bringing in
of the ways yeah but more is a long-term
thing like I gotta lose weight for this
event it's like no you want to lose
weight so you get to your ideal weight
or whatever to feel good about yourself
but you're not doing it for something
because that never lasts like you want
it sort of look of it
more long-term then
oh yeah I found that I've lost a lot of
weight by cutting out gluten sorry I now
eat gluten-free bread and I don't
usually have more than two slices a day
and I've also substituted full cream
milk for almond milk or soy milk and
zimmel it was really good yeah I found
that I just lost weight from doing that
easy to maintain because I'm eating like
bread and that processed foods like that
like it makes you fatigued to act yeah
it's not good for your body and if you
can avoid simple things like that we'll
change it for life you can look it up
sorry you don't have to get milk instead
of having full cream milk white cup I
presume or something like they have like
skim or you know full cream but it's
like a better sort of yeah names how do
you like about yourself everything very
I like um hey my eyes and melon I like
my nose city I like my eyes yeah thanks

about yourself
