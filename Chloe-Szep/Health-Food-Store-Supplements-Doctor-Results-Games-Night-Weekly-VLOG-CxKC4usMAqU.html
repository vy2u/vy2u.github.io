reading the map no no taking cash looks
like a judge a professional cricket
player a sponsor child of Elijah Wilson
an American footballer inventor of chess
saying
checkmate inventor of the TriNet
invented his own Indian cuisine chicken
again yeah I just put some food in the
oven for myself I'm just gonna have
chicken and other let's go
I'm just walking on my way to the doctor
I've been paying a lot lately like
frequent urination like every Ally
needed to go like twice so I'm gonna go
to the doctor and sing random all the
sea
ordered a chicken salad with pumpkin and
quinoa yummy yummy yummy I just wanted
to run you guys through my supplements
that I take every day I know a lot of
you are really interested to know guys
know that I have places to go variant
syndrome I have about 60 cysts on my
ovaries so my life basically is aimed to
manage my place cystic ovarian syndrome
symptoms so that's what I do with my
supplementation in the morning I try to
incorporate some superfoods
to help like hormone balancing and all
that fun stuff and obviously your gut
comes into play when it comes to
hormones and everything your gut is just
Center control of basically a whole body
so when your guts out of whack a lot of
things are going to be out of whack
including your hormones so let me show
you guys what I take in the mornings and
yeah I wanted to let you know that I do
have a card because I didn't want to
recommend all these products and then if
you wanted to buy them I didn't want you
to have to pay full price so I do have a
card take off ten for the website elites
ups it has everything that I take and I
make sure I made sure that it did before
I got the code so that you guys can also
purchase umm this stuff so hopefully it
helps you as well okay so the first
thing I take is the ATP science alpha
Venus this is a female hormone balance
all right this is my second bottle I've
been taking this for about six months
something like that but yeah so
basically ATP science are people that
have created some really really good
supplements for women and men and
they've created like a really good
stress one which we're gonna put in my
how to de-stress video when I do that
because I use it religiously yeah they
do some really good products Mutual
takes the alpha Mars which is this but
the male of the
basically it just balances at your
monthly fluctuations of your words so I
take this one every day one every
morning then I take BIOS think tablet so
basically is zinc is really really good
for your skin it just helps with acne
and because of polycystic ovarian
syndrome a very big side effect that I
get is acne so I like to take a
supplement that helps that side of
things and I take apple cider vinegar
tablets because of polycystic ovaries
yeah you can um be a little bit insulin
resistant these balances out your blood
sugar levels instead of having to shot
this stuff because it tastes like feet
another thing that I take from my gut is
I take a probiotic so then I've just
started taking this I take a scoop every
morning then the last few things that I
use of a morning in my smoothies I put
some superfoods into my smoothies or I
just put them all in a thing of water
and I just shot it because it doesn't
taste too amazing and I like my
smoothies in the morning to taste good
so firstly I take the kombucha mood I
think that's how you say it honestly
don't judge me I don't really know this
is a really really powerful vitamin C
and you know what vitamin C does it eats
away at free radicals free radicals when
you exercise a lot you produce a lot
more so you need vitamin C's to like eat
them away because they damage your cells
and cause like aging and all that fun
stuff
the cancers so eating vitamin C's is
really really essential in your diet I
probably don't need enough which is why
I supplement them into my I'm smoothies
and stuff I then take maca powder a
teaspoon of this every day really a
really good for hormone balancing it's
an antioxidant a source of vitamin C so
maca powder is really good and then I
have turmeric in my smoothies as well or
if I am doing a Hikari I'll put a bit of
sumac in that as well
turmeric is really good for information
it's an anti-inflammatory a natural one
from the earth and at nighttime I use a
magnesium I can magnesium drink I just
put a spoonful in water and I drink that
before I go to bed and it just calms
your um adrenal system or I just got a
supplement called adrenal switch from
elite sups which I'm going to try out
don't let you guys know as well so you
go to Bali on Tuesday which I'm so
 excited about and tonight I have
to do the whole wash my hair what my
teeth okay so because I'm going away I'm
gonna whiten my teeth before I go as you
guys know I have the news on my top 10
teeth sir obviously I can't whiten those
but I can't wash my bottom teeth and you
see how they're not the same color my
bottom teeth aren't is white so I have
to regularly UM whiten them with at home
whitening so I used the hi smile teeth
whitening kits you guys have probably
heard about them a lot because a lot of
people do use hi smile because they are
very good their packaging is literally
so early nice so first I'm going to use
the the night toothpaste there's a day
one in the night one and I'm just gonna
brush my teeth before I start to lighten
them so it is dark because obviously the
charcoal makes it darker
this is the kit that it comes with it
done turn minutes is nothing and I just
do it while I'm like packing while I was
packing for Bali I just but I think
check my description if you guys want to
hitch um check out Highsmith see how
hard it should get to press play with my
dogs even just go around the corner just
back from the doctor's so when I got my
blood test the other day like all my
urine samples and everything came back
fine which is um which is good he tested
my thyroid and my thyroid is overactive
but yeah he's gonna retest me in two
weeks and sees my thyroid is still out
of whack but for the moment that's what
I know he's referred me to a
gynecologist for my polycystic ovarian
syndrome to get that sussed out oh yeah
I'm going to get my wisdom teeth out in
a couple of weeks I feel like like
everything is happening to my body at
once anyway it's better to get it all
looked at so I recommend if you guys
like get symptoms in your body you
should go to a doctor and get them to
test everything like from hormones to
adrenals to cortisol to thyroid to
everything I'll keep you guys updated on
what happens but at the moment my
thyroid is a little bit over what it
should be but he said it's only just a
little bit over so in a couple of weeks
I'm going to go back and get test it
again to see what it's like after that
okay I got a paxil but I'll let you know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
