that today because I'm putting the blog
off the night for the Wednesday you guys
are probably watching this look because
you're wondering what the hell I'm doing
it today that's so different I am in I
am going to be undergoing a little bit
of a chain ll in my whole 19 years of
living on this thing order
I have never dyed my hair different club
always being a blonde sorry I want to
run you through my thought process for
this this year for me 2018 2018 is all
about change it's all about growth it's
all about experiencing line doing things
that I would have never done before
stepping out of my comfort zone if that
means change my hair color I'm gonna
change my hair color change is necessary
in life like change is good if your
life's changing girl you get another
line you are growing you are getting
somewhere other than where you were
thank you my hair color is a very small
step but the small steps lead to the big
step whether it's changing your hair
color hanging out of a building
bring your fear Heights is what I'll be
doing this is all that change so at the
end of the year I'm going to be a
completely new person after doing all of
this stuff if I look back myself a year
ago before I moved to Melbourne or I
moved out of home I was a completely
different person and I would still be
that person if I still lived at home if
I still lived in the same state if I
didn't move from Queensland Victoria all
these little changes help you become the
person that you are the more little
changes you do the more you'll grow more
different of a person you'll be people
say that changing as a person is a bad
thing I don't think that at all I think
change is like the best thing ever
that's what we're here to do we're here
to experience things and change as a
person and I'm really rambling on I was
meant to be talking about hair and I've
gone into like JT it's a person so I'm
gonna take you guys along with me today
sure
and I'm so excited to see what it looks
like and I'm sure you guys are as well
