that you guys are really curious about
this one you've been asking about my
smile and what has changed so I thought
I would share my journey with you guys
and for those who have been watching me
you've noticed that I've been going back
and forth gentle boutique to get a few
things done
I was honestly so pleased with my
results and my experience when I went to
dental boutique the only thing I ever
want wanted for my teeth and I was
really fussy was somebody who's really
good at dentistry and inserting veneers
somebody that did natural veneers and
someone that didn't prep them too much
you know how you see those teeth and
they're like little stumps I did not
want that that was like my biggest fear
in the world so I looked into it for
different places in Melbourne and I saw
that dental boutique and um one of my
friends he so I researched him to them I
heat more and went to them for like my
teeth whitening first at Christmastime
and then I was discussing with them
getting veneers they were like assessing
my teeth so I've always wanted veneers
it was just a matter of who I was gonna
go to and finding somebody that did a
good job so it was quite a big step for
me but I found dr. Ruben seam at dental
boutique and he was seriously amazing so
I had braces when I was I think I was
just in grade 8 in Grenada had braces I
had quite a few teeth and I didn't like
the gaps that I had and mum had like a
health insurance so she was like well if
you want to get braces get them now so I
ended up getting braces but I still
wasn't happy with my teeth after the
braces and I feel like they moved my
teeth black around to the side so I'm
gonna share with you what my teeth look
like before and there's like a before
and after that I'm gonna put on the
screen now if your teeth don't bother
you please don't feel like you need to
get work done on your teeth for me I was
just concerned about how my teeth lived
in person and when I smiled when I
talked if I always kept my mouth shut
and smiled with my mouth closed so I
wasn't expressing myself in my smile as
much
as I should and I felt a little bit
self-conscious about it so if you do
look closely these photos my teeth on
the top are really small and quite round
with like quite a few spaces in between
them so that is why I chose to get
veneers done I had a consultation with
Ruben in each of the photos of my teeth
the color what color I would aspire to
have the size and shape what size and
shape I loved I showed him like a heap
of rows of teeth that I really loved
that was similar to my own shape and I
just kind of just said I want bigger
longer teeth that I can that you can see
while I'm talking because my old teeth
you can't we couldn't really see when I
was talking you could predominantly see
my bottom teeth but not my top so that
was all good after you doing the
consultation I was really happy and I
went home and like made a decision
whether I should actually get them
because again I was like super concerned
I'm changing like my whole smile you
want someone that you're gonna trust and
it's gonna be really good what they do
my whole experience have done to
boutique was amazing I've vlogged
basically every appointment that I went
to in the past few months so that's my
next row this lock no but um I'm really
scared of needles in the mouth cuz when
I had braces I feel like they just
scarred me when I had braces they
literally to rip them off and just Park
me here and there and everywhere but my
experience with dr. urban and then
Tweety painless quick
easy the three ways that I could
describe it all right so seriously sorry
good look at that I got ten across the
top and I'm sorry happy with my mom I
didn't get any on the butter but that's
not my teeth look like now see how they
just match up and they're just sorry
much like my other teeth that just
better so I'm gonna leave you guys with
the blog map and you can see my exact
experience I hope you guys enjoyed this
video please don't forget to give it a
thumbs up and if you don't already
subscribe to my channel
so I just arrived at so that just doing
my ten trees
so these are my Oh teeth lots of
negative spaces my newbies with shudder
yeah see one thing I've wasted scared
about the dentists is the numbing
needles but I'll actually do not feel
anything you can explain what we're
doing all right so what I'm gonna do now
is to do some company for Chloe's teeth
because Chloe has got quite small teeth
to a Sabathia on the only left and right
side so when you did a comedy video
allows us to actually expose a bit more
teeth so we can get nicer longer looking
teeth okay
this is how much they grow and a mighty
so basically this is that what we're
doing is when you're putting a bit of
temper material into extent or like a
key and what will happen is that we
wouldn't transfer the max or they design
that we did for Chloe into Chloe's mouth
in the next few minutes so this will be
basically the most exciting parts of
blow me I think to get to see that a new
smell is that them
yeah the temporaries sorry
natural-looking yeah yeah
and once the everyone comes in do look
even better they look amazing and
they're only the temporaries thank you
so much
so my numbing is gone away thank God and
I can actually talk properly now my new
teeth they're just the temporaries
obviously so I get my actual veneers in
the waist but just better marks 50th so
I just had another good one guys
today is very exciting day for me I am
getting my veneers on sorry I'm on my
way to dental routine and right now chew
get them on so I'll be will be there for
a couple of hours and then I'll have
fresh smile a whole new smile so if
you're wondering why I got veneers I
used to have really small teeth like
when I talked you couldn't really see my
tape I had to like really done this so
they just like lengthening the teeth and
making them a little bit bigger but when
I got my um temporaries on it was
seriously the easiest experience about
winning then they like roughened up my
tapes there's not really any prick
you
getting my posters on today dr. Reagan
ready to have a beautiful smile
sir this is how much they grind the
teeth down which is nothing at all
so they're basically purple it's not a
ribbon yes yeah well butchery Douglas
sorry I just got the vinius cemented and
temporarily which means they're not
permanently in yet just to see if I like
the color the size the shape all that
sort of stuff I've been waiting for this
day with it make it long enough brought
enough and bright enough so help this
one this is actually the brightness that
I'm a bride Yeah right the whiteness but
is it what to think so yeah people
relate them this is one thing yeah
that's just one different it can be
really wise but can you doctor is my
sobriety youthful so that no that's you
see well so we pick the color because it
majesty - what's it going on yeah I
think played a big role
all right perfect that's the minute oh
my god you guys I just got my money is
it I literally can't move I'm done for
my nerves to Miley
Liberty women if open bodies then you
pests are natural and
I've actually existed nice I love

been a couple of weeks since I got my
veneers on and I am literally obsessed
they've fully settled into my math he
said that the color would hmm the color
would fully settle in look at them it

I just wanted to say thank you so much
