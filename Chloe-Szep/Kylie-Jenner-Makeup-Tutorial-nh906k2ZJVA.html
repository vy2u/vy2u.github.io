because I am one of the first which had
put one of last Kylie the first episode
was anything she was so genuine at my
favorite scene was when she went to prom
with a guy she just seemed so sweet and
genuine and she might be probably got
just a random guy what famous person
Elsa and lack of cars
sorban amazing makeup looks you'll see
her makeup artist is amazing I'm
obsessed with reality TV and if you know
me either obsessed with Kylie Jenner I
watch all my half slide all of my
Keeping Up with the Kardashians when you
calm tha why you calm and there are Lisa
same days us so there's no waiting time
so happy about that you can watch
unlimited $5.99 and listen I decided to
create one of her amazing looks from the
video so I created just is super
clueless big lash the soft lip look for
you guys so if you want to repeat it you
can I mean almost all of the products in
the description so how does the
description if you want to see the
product keep watching this video if you
want to see the final final look or the
follicle Oh
firstly I'm going to start making that
base nice flawless with my synergy
minerals mineral within the shade
cappuccino I was going to be taking that
all over my face
and then taking my heart shape check
concealer in shade medium and blending
this under my eyeballs to hide those
bags and create a fuller space like
Kylie Jenner always seems to have going
on going to use my finger because it
helps it blend a little bit more and on
the top of my eyelid as well just to get
rid of all the creases taking my Laura
Mercier translucent powder under my eyes
it literally creates such a flawless
look once you wipe it away
I'm then taking my all-time favorite
palette using the shade Hannah and I'm
just going to blend this into my whole
eye shadow lid eyeshadow it my whole
eyes with Kylie seems to juice a rock
like a one shadow kind of lid just like
a matte so that's what I'm going to do
and it seems to have a little bit of an
orange tinge then I'm going to take
orange under the eye orange seriously
contrast to the blue and makes the blue
stand out so much the girls with blue
eyes use orange in your colors and then
going to take my eyebrow pencil from
L'Oreal and fill in these badboys taking
the shade Koko I'm going to also take an
angled brush enter a winged liner just a
little bit of a wing not too much Kylie
seems to wear shadow liners now not your
liquid bandage so I'm just gonna do a
shadow liner and kind of blend it out a
little bit not too much she seems to
have like a neat line but still I'm just
going to blend it out a tiny bit and
then I'm going to take my next max
mascara and just cut the lashes before
popping on these glam by Medicare lashes
I'm then going to take my Mecca Maxo
bronzer and just put a little bit all
over my face she doesn't seem true
bronze she more seems to be able to
blush but I'm just going to do that
anyway and then take my Laura Mercier
powder and kind of dust the leftover off
and then I'm using the Physicians
Formula blush and pop it into my cheeks
quite a bit because she's nice and rosy
in the video and I love blush brush is
literally my newfound love then taking
my Mac soft and gentle highlight and
popping it in the high points of my face
I'm then taking just I don't even know
the brand of this one because I think
it's come off but just like a pinky kind
of lip liner and lining my lips a little
bit over lining because I like the big
lip then taking a matte lipstick or she
always seems to have a matte lip I think
I got this one just from Rimmel and the
look is finished we are the finished
look thank you guys so much for watching
I really hope you enjoyed this video and
don't forget if you watch off a
colleague on the 7th of August
Monday night my description because I'll
leave it all there but it's on how you
don't color you can't get a three a
three a free 30-day trial and my voice
is baffling the buildings are I'm gonna
go
