today I'm just going to do a bit of a
vlog we just went grocery shopping so

Kashi and then I think we're going to
give a cake to our neighbors because
it's got so much cake it's your birthday
leftovers seriously the best cake but
it's just so big we're never going to
eat all that out let's do this like a
liquid now this is what we got in
the grocery store I'm making like a
garlic prawn pasta tonight because
Mitchell has we have training this

really healthy one no preservatives low
salt no GMO colorful flavours source of
fiber low fat it's like gluten free
wheat free egg free not free dairy free

the best it's like three dollars for a
massive thing sick so I was at six today

nothing in it it's just like chicken
so it's like chicken turkey lamb mince
natural gelling agents salt minerals and
vitamins sweet potato parsley and
sunflower oil to serve it it free so

take my car to hold it to get a service
and then I've got Petey

Thanks
no the birth weight training absolutely
takes me into
I workout - see
thank you can I tell you how some 60
South
hey Jessie hello
are you keeping so this is the
pre-workout that we use is called make
weight by flight fuel up to fat-burning
a pre-workout it's a slow release on
though so it releases like throughout
the day instead of all at once because I
usually get a headache from pre-workout
but this one actually doesn't give me a
headache 3/4 3/4 of the screen Mitch
yeah can shoot fresh check and give them
away okay
get a load of this tiffy do you like put
this bottom cheese out now and his ears
go puppy oh my goodness who's a cute
baby
this is how we carry cash around 30
trainees
this is my peepee dance excuse so yes
I'm Dan I'm getting coffee she said yes
I first exercise of today's session is
barbell Romanian did this as you can see
Chloe's keeping the hips up as high as
possible as she comes down bar stays
right on their legs and on the way up
just pulling through the heels I
thinking about pushing the heels into
the ground finishing with a neutral
pelvis glutes as tight as possible
okay exercise number two Bulgarian split
squats and we're using dumbbells today
so Chloe's got ten kilos each and here
the cues you want to think about on this
exercise is weight stays through the
front heel toe it stays neutral and you
just dropping just right up and down the
chest is up you'll be feeling this
through the front foot or through the
front leg should be seen through the
quad and the glute it's what we're going
to do is go from 12 reps each leg
straight into the next exercise 30
seconds of max reps super setting the
Bulgarian split squats with barbell back
squats probably going to go 30 seconds
max rep so hips are back knees are out
really focus on driving the knees out on
the way up
couples are trying to get a stay
together moving on to our next exercise
now the overhead walking lunges holding
the played straight up above your head
so Chloe I want you to focus on keeping
your abs on and not leaning back really
focus on putting the weight through the
front heel and moving up and forward so
every step Chloe think about squeezing
you good soup setting the walking lunges
with a front squat with the heels
elevated so close use a slightly
elevated on the platform this is really
going to target the cords so sitting
back keeping the weight through your
heels we need a dumbbell or kettlebell
medicine ball anything that you've got
access to parts of moving on the sumo
deadlift now so we probably set up a
feet nice and wide so feet of wide toes
are slightly out bar is going to be
right up against the legs the whole time
I was kind of resting in side the knees
shoulders apart right Chloe rep number
one shoulders tight knees out squeeze
the glutes the top and you come down
between every rep completely rest
tighten up and reset on the way up the
key is to have your shoulder blades as
tight as possible and try and push the
floor apart with your feet to really
drive your knees out
squeeze the glutes the top guys number
three good clothes
I was super setting the hip thrusts with
some crab-walk
so bands now around the ankles keeping
the street at least shoulder width apart
at all times and stepping out as far as
possible create as much tension on the
band and towards the gluts as we can
important part of these don't bring your
feet back inside shoulder width there's
constant tension on the gluts
next exercise we're doing hip thrusts
with the added band around the knee so
the whole point of the band around the
need is to create extra tension to put
more tension on the glutes
so the bottom of each rep Chloe's going
to talk about though is under so drawing
your belly button in towards your spine
and pushing up through the heels keeping
the knees right out against the band
squeezing the gluts atop so we're trying
it hips up as high as you can so
finishing off the lower body session
with some conditioning so there's really
no need to be doing a lot of long slow
low intensity cardio for fat loss you're
going to get the most out of
high-intensity interval training so
going hard as possible up and back for
around 20 to 30 seconds of work is ever
going to be resting 60 or 90 seconds
between sets the whole purpose of
high-intensity training the hardware
supplies possible let's drop back down
and not see the queen of national epic
yet and what's going to do is elevate
your heart rate for longer and also how
they I was promised so even one future
exercises you're burning calories
we're just going to say we're going to
be expending energy we're a long slow
distance cardiac surgeon stop stop very
intelligent done so in my opinion might
let people try to
much mutual business Louis I go so to
finish off your strength session it's
always good to time roll or do some form
of myofascial release so most gyms have
foam rollers so today I'm going to get
Chloe to roll through glutes she'll then
do a hamstrings calves quads and lower
back also beneficial to do this at the
start a session as well sorry Dan's
going to tell you his youtube link he
does pieces yet analog fitness nutrition
spectrum although some videos like you a
gotta sign a lot tougher but they also
like red bean so you've got what I ate
and the easy way to detail from the
results start to get my YouTube and
candy in it I'll link it below is a and
watch their channel enjoy any toppings

thank you
I'm feeling very good after I mean I'm
getting motivated the last two days is
moving out from each other okay it
happens every time I go out but I think
that's just what Congress is having a
good time
so if there was going to have a people

push myself to work out and then I'm
back on
every day hopefully the motivation thing
