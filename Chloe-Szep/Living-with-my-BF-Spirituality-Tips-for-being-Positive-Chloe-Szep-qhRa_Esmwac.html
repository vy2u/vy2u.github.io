open that door
so he decides to stop vacuuming
I'm actually gonna cry hey guys and
welcome back to my channel so today
Cydia is going to be a question and
answer I haven't done one of these for
the longest time so I can't wait to
catch up with you guys and answer the
questions that you have
I'm currently filming in my garage with
the garage door open so if it's a little
bit loud I apologize I need to get a
microphone
Mitchell Mitchell just farted in the
background I think we should just get
straight into this video don't forget to
subscribe if you haven't already and
like this video
oh my backgrounds movie so
first question as you guys know a little
bit of background info if you don't know
about a month ago I moved out of
Mitchell's parents place and I'm now
living near my own place with Mitchell
which is super exciting how's things
going with you and Mitch living in your
own home I am absolutely loving it I
love my own space I love that I can do
whatever I want
walk out of the shower without having to
be in a towel it's all the small things
that I love about living with Mitchell
so I think we've come a little bit
closer living together it's like the
next stage of commitment we have our
little puppy dog cache and it's like
we're just a little family so much fun
having your own home you can like deck
it out how you want to I'm currently
turning my garage into like my filming
space in my office if you haven't moved
out of home when you do you will know
what I mean it seriously just like a
breath of fresh air another question
that's kind of relative to the last one
that I answered Molly asked how are you
finding Melbourne compared to Brisbane
wow that David's getting closer I'm just
gonna wait well each have their pros and
cons obviously Marvin's a lot colder
Brisbane is a lot warmer sunny all the
time I'm obsessed with the Sun so like
that's a bit of a con living in
Melbourne but when summer comes around
it's awesome
I still love the background noise the
sparking planes trains and automobiles
gosh nerve will the lighting be
then everything gonna wait echoey Guerra
just coming down well it's sorry echoey
Mitchell can you open that door so he
decides to stop vacuuming I'm
actually gonna cry
so I just shut the garage so that
there's no background noise there's
still background noise I literally can't
avoid it so I'm gonna get a microphone
for my next video but for this one we're
just gonna have to copy sweet on the
chin Mitch oh it's so loud Wow the
vacuum fifteen minutes please yeah sorry
yeah back to the video
Lulu offs is it stressful running your
own business okay for me it's a very
stressful just because I'm so
unorganized which I really hate that I
am because I'd love to be OCD and I'd
love to be organized but she's not
something that I was blessed with I'm
working on it there once I get this
office and stuff together I think my
life will slowly come together the last
like year has been so hard to get my
life in order just because before I
moved to Melbourne but you know doing
long-distance so it was like a roller
coaster of emotions all the time I
wasn't on a flat level I hadn't a
routine because every second week I was
kind of flying back here when I'd get
home I'd be really sad for the whole
time I was home and I do want to film
and then I went back to Mitch's and I
was happy in Melbourne but it was like
it was hard to film because I don't know
it's just new and fresh and there's so
much going on that it was just
kind of a more overwhelming and I think
my work kind of went by me a little bit
and I stopped for a while and when I was
living with Mitchell's family it was
kind of hard to feel
sit down videos because those people in
the house all the time and knows which
is so fun and I loved it but it's just
hot a hard time to film what it's like
that now that I have my own place my own
space filming so much easier and now
that was settled in the house
everything's in we're just putting the
office and study together now I feel
like my life is just pieced together
like a puzzle you have to start running
a business when you've got heaps going
on but like you just have to be
organized and have your together
which is something I haven't had
together for a very long time in high
school what was the worst experience you
had if you guys have followed me for a
while you know that I wasn't the best in
high school like I wasn't always
attending I didn't really like high
school I'm not gonna lie it wasn't for
me and it's not a waste for people so
always for a lot of people and I didn't
really have a lot of friends in high
school I'm the type of person that if
you me over or do something wrong
see ya you're out of my life which is
probably why I don't really have that
many friends but I'm happy I'm so happy
with my own company that I don't really
need fake friends and I had like a
vibrational shift time this whole mental
shift where everything just changed I
wasn't sure about anything in my life
like begin huh happens all the time
really
I stopped pleasing a lot of people I did
things for myself for a change which I
never really did and I just felt
different so I've always been quite a
spiritual person and I believe in a lot
of things but when we first started
dating I was seeing 11:11 all the time
and 11:11 means like new beginnings keep
going on the path you kind of going on
your bided you're protected that's the
other thing so I was like ooh this is
weird I just kept seeing ones 11 this
sequence the whole time then Mitchell
started seeing it as well like all the
time like bizarre I would just be out
somewhere and I've noticed 11:11 out of
time like on a second thing I know it's
like someone telling me do what you're
thinking because it's the right thing to
do like my brain was like getting rid of
things that I didn't like him just
pushing all negative things away and now
I feel like I'm at a place where I'm so
happy and so content with life and I
feel like it's because I did those
things that I didn't want to do and I
was guided to do those things to be
happier any tips on how to stay positive
Nikki don't scenario my three main tips
to staying positive would be distraction
so when you're thinking negatively
distract yourself straight away listen
to music like you can does anyone else
kind of like control their mind like
they're thinking something they think
okay you're thinking bad think of
something else to be aware of your
thinking so be really aware of your
thinking is another one so when you're
thinking bad be aware snap it into
something else your mind is so strong
you can literally change your thought
pattern other-- positive tip my third
one that I kind of live by is working
out everyday as it releases good
endorphins eating healthy because a lot
of the time your mood is affected by
what you eat so eating healthy making
sure you're working out every day to
release endorphins happy endorphins
if you're feeling negative or if you're
feeling like sad or you just want to get
something out of your head going to the
gym is such a good thing to do to try
and push away those negative feelings
focusing on something else running
weight I really like go off on tangents
and I just forget what I say and then I
end up repeating myself a hundred time
so I'm really sorry that's and I think
I'm gonna finish this Q&amp;amp;A here but thank
you so much everyone that commented some
questions out doing Q&amp;amp;A is just catching
up with you guys and letting me know
what you actually want to hear so thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
