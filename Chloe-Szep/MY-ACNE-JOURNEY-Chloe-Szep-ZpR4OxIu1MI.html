channel so I thought now would be the
perfect time to film this video I've
wanted to film for a very long time but
the problem is my skin hasn't been good
until now like it's still not perfect
but it's at a point where I can actually
sit down and be like okay I'm happy with
my skin it's something that I'm not
worrying about every day now it's not
like a massive issue to me so finally I
feel like I can sit down and talk to you
guys about my skin journey I'm gonna
start with back when I went through
puberty so I got my period when I was in
grade 7 and it's one of the problems
started so as soon as I got my period as
soon as I could kind of I went on the
pill and I was like - mom I want to go
on the pill not for any reasons that I
was having sex because I literally
didn't have sex till its grade 12 so it
was purely because I just wanted to get
on the pill people put you on pills
Tomas the problem not true prevent it or
help it from happening
but just stop the problem completely
they just put you in a pill and say this
little trick this will help you this'll
there's somebody Clary pimples in our
problems the next minute you nerd you
come off the pill and get stopped
because the pill masks it it doesn't get
rid of it it started breaking out a
little bit um in grade 7 and a little
bit on wigs and no one else was really
getting that period and Here I am the
only one with like skin so I will
make up in grade 7 like how bad is
alright let's make out now than I did
when I was young women on the pill okay
I wrote down like the pills I went on
because my god I would have literally
any pill you said I would you have to
say yeah
so first pillar when I'm with Diane I
feel like that's what they put up
everyone on them first like they just
say yeah whack you on Diane it'll get
rid of your pimples it's meant to be
like the first one you go on taggi thing
so I went on Diane did not help my skin
well they did a little bit but I got so
fat like you don't understand but for my
own body I was like bigger than I wanted
to be in great about 9 I started putting
on the weight from the pill me bring I'm
weight and my body type changing in the
exact same time so like going through
puberty and putting on weight at the
same time was very depressing like it
made me so down about myself like
throughout whole high
throughout my whole high school I was
like battling my wife and I was battling
with my relationship with food and just
being healthy and I was a binge eating
it wasn't good I got to about grade 12
grade 11 I started being very health
conscious great yeah great 11 I'd say
grade 11 and 12 I started being quite
conscious of my health what I was
putting in my mouth because I wanted to
lose weight and that will be in like a
very bad headspace I started doing
modeling I modeled with this agency and
in the modeling industry even though I
wasn't a model model but like with
your head well it with mine
anyway because I was like I need to lose
weight if I want to get shoots and if I
want to do anything in this type of
career it just wasn't healthy mindset I
hadn't had a healthy mindset before that
so I went into modelling then all of the
way all of the pressure to just be a
stick in the modelling industry I think
I didn't sure I've got photos from an
age of ducking a catwalk show I modeled
these dresses and
Keeney piece and I felt started about
myself I wasn't even fat at all like I
had a pretty good body I would have been
happy with it right now then I just felt
terrible on the catwalk and that wasn't
good for my mental space and it wasn't
good because I then saw they've been
cheating worse because I was like
starving myself and then a night opt out
of everything ia oh my god it was
disaster and my skin when I was doing
modeling with so as well and that
just put me down even more so as you can
already tell right down the bottom down
here and nothing's working for me in
about grade 12 grade 11 maybe I'd say I
wanted to go on rocket I'm really bad
because people have told me like it's
the only way you can get rid of acne
like it'll go forever I was like
yeah that's amazing and I was like - mom
I want to go over a key tape and she's
like no why would you want to do that
you're not going around ten we probably
thought about the so long and I was just
determined to go over a few ten somehow
got my hands on my keychain and I did
two weeks ago accutane so my skin
cleared up so two weeks is literally all
I needed unwrapped and I did two weeks
you didn't have any side effects - I
probably got dry lips that's about it my
peoples cleared up I went off the pill
and I didn't need to be on the pill
anymore so I went off the pill for a
while and grade 12 I started seeing
Mitchell when I repeated my skin was
okay for a while and then all of a
sudden it broke out I actually used this
mask and put it on my face and I'm gonna
rash from it and then
since then which is probably middle of
last year I started breaking out very
badly and I'll show you videos and
photos I've got on my phone from when it
was at its peak bad then I started going
to a skin clinic to get stuff done to my
face
try and get rid of it I ended up going
back on the pill that made it worse
didn't even clear my skin and if you
know me I'm quite a really person um
what I'm seriously the happiest person
of me but I can get really moody when I
want to so I used to take it out of mom
and mom I just hoped it like I felt I
feel so bad daddy's like mom if you
watching this I'm so sorry
and I probably took a lot of my anger
out of my mom because I lived with her
at the time but then I got a boyfriend
so like I started dating Mitch and I
realized look I'm taking all this
 out on him so that's when I decided
to go and see a naturopath and that was
probably one of the best things I've
done at times in the bubby hey my name
is Lola so yeah I do got blowouts which
affects your skin diet affects your skin
not gonna lie
drink a little water have a lot of nice
and G's and fruits and your skin will
start going I promise you so you know

skin is cleared up
