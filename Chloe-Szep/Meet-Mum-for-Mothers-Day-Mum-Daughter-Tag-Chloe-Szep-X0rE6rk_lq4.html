tag sorry let's get straight into it
sorry it's a how well do you know me mom
daughters hang the first question is

delightful
alright yeah you sleep all the time then
you are very happy always used to say
hello to people that you didn't know
when they went shopping and yeah you
were very very sweet still in have you
learned anything from makeup of beauty
for me yes because she's always telling
me that I'm doing everything wrong and
that I shouldn't use my thing is when
I'm putting on my foundation I do not
iron a brushed except for a really cheap
blusher brush that came with my blood so
that she'll brush she Felicia
yeah what's a weird habit of mine
rocking no rocks all the time and when
she was a baby she has rocked constantly
she actually rocks to get herself to
sleep she will move her leg in the car
when we're stopped at the lights and it
makes the whole car shake if you get
ready his sheep know if he had to rename
me what would you know me if she wasn't
a girl her name was gonna be Connor I
know when we go out to eat what do i
order
everything on the menu she loves to eat
but what is one thing you wish I would
do clean your room yeah it's up off the
bathroom floor and you tear off your
bedroom floor what's something I do then
annoys you do I have to just narrow it
down to one high
oh look I'll probably think of something
lighter but Chloe's a pretty good girl
yes what's something I obsess over
I don't know obsessed over I Clarence's
over anything so okay where would you
like to see me in ten years ten years I
think that always gonna be very
successful no I don't know when we most
proud me we're quits good what's the
worst thing I've ever done mouthwash
yeah yeah when she was little she had my
blue nail polish and she wouldn't give
it to me and I asked her to hand it to
me and she said no and I put my hand out
and she flicked it behind her
and it went all over my passel like
colored lounge so I wasn't very happy
but then what'd you do to me sorry
that's the end of the questions the
mother-daughter tag to see a bit about
what mum thinks of me I've ever Dora I
really don't like any other jokes so yes
