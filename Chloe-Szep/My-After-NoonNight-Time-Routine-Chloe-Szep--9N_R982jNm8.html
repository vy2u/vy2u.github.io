into my room I will be there laying on
my bed scrolling through Facebook
Twitter YouTube tumblr any of those but
usually I will just be laying on my bed
and hibernating in my room times you
might find me sitting at my office just
doing some assignments or something that
that's usually only when I have an
assignment due or exam to study for
because I'm not just going to sit at my
desk and I don't have anything to study
for let's be serious but today I was
actually packing for New Zealand so I
was going through my clothes to pick out
the warm ones true pack for New Zealand
so just going through and I've found a
nice cozy best and a nice warm jacket so
I'm just going to chuck those on my bed
and go to my shoes and find which shoes
I will be wearing most in New Zealand so
mainly clothes and shoes but it's going
to be from freezing and I'll just chuck
those ones my bed as well to pack in my
suitcase later once I finished packing
my stuff I went into the kitchen and
myself a banana smoothie I also put some
butter chicken in the microwave before
but didn't film that part so I'm just
going to prepare my banana smoothie I
have some yogurt honey some cinnamon
some milk and some ice that is usually
all I use my smoothies so I'm just going
to cut up my banana and throw it in my
blender and then going to add the yogurt
and the honey then a sprinkle of
cinnamon enough milk and the ice
and then put that in the blender and
just watch it will end up just blend it
for a couple minutes usually and then
I'm just going to grab a cup out of the
cupboard and pull my smoothie into the
cup
fetch my butter chicken and there's my
butter chicken and banana smoothie I'll
then go to the table and eat it at the
table
I usually just scroll through my phone
mom eating and my god was delicious
leftovers aren't they always good so
here I am checking the snapchat seeing
what all my friends are up to for the
day and I'm eating again and then just
checking everything on my social media
once I finished I just chucked my bowl
and plates in the sink and then off I'd
go to the bathroom going to have a
shower but you cannot see me get
undressed so and I get into the shower I
just like to wash my body with some warm
water then use the jelly soothing
I mean cleanser if my models prepare
pore cleansing pad and just rub my face
get all my makeup off then rinse my face
off then once I've washed off and stuff
I just jump out of the shower and put my
robe on Suns just from Susan's I think
it's my mom
then I use the jelly calendula redness
calming mist it just calms down the
redness of my face then followed by the
calendula redness risky restoration
treatment serum
then I use the jelly calendula soothing
moisturizing cream then I go in with my
eye cream from Estee Lauder and then I
use my cocoa butter lip balm then I go
in with my Rexona girl deodorant spray
and then lastly I brush my teeth with
Colgate got a love bit of Colgate and I
just brush my teeth for a couple of
minutes making sure that all of my
breath is fresh and smelling good so I'm
just rinsing my mouth here and brushing
my tongue you tongue get some rice germs
and makes your breath smell Sur brush
you turn peeps and then lastly back two
nights a week I use my hello smile so
I'm just getting the spit out of my
mouth here and then applying the hello
smile whitening pen and I just apply it
to all of my front teeth bottom end to
top so this pen is so handy you can use
it wherever and it's fun it's pretty
much instant I would say as soon as I
start using it my teeth do notice ligo
more white and I've been using this for
a few weeks now and I'm absolutely
loving it so I leave that for about 10
minutes I'm actually did stand here for
ten minutes waiting for it to turn so
then when it's done I
grab some water in my mouth and rinse
and then spit it all out and that's just
how you use it it's so so easy I'll
leave the link below for you guys to
check out their website
and then I go into my bedroom and lay on
my bed this is usually my down time so
here I am just scrolling through my
social media usually my YouTube I'm
checking my YouTube videos after I do
all of that I then go and watch orphan
black my favorite favorite TV series and

go to bed so there we go good night
