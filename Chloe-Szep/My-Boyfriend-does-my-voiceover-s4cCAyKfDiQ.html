this like fly spray the key is just
wafting it like you're just like walking
a fart next up is a little tub varmint
milk you just apply that with that
little ue boom looking thing and just
keep rubbing up just rub rub rub wink at
the camera keep rubbing forehead all the
way down to the cheekbone back to the
forehead you know just get a real groove
going speed it up if you can look at
that I'm on fast forward here gum like a
 bull in a china shop I've pretty
much mastered the art of coloring in now
on my favorite products the lemon tart
first you just got to get out your
coloring stick aim under the eyes
perfect for bags under the eyes color it
in keep coloring even add a dab to the
forehead if you must and the chin go for
the chin oh and the nose and the top of
your lip get your Yui burn keep coloring
just color color color color color stop
pause and keep coloring if you get tired
don't be afraid to take a break
arthritis is a thing but as we learn in
kindergarten it is important to stay in
between the lines when coloring in so if
you do miss and you know click the air
or get it in your hair be sure to fix
that up now if I must be perfectly
honest I've got a bit of a hot tip for
everyone at home you know the the
massive rolling sticks that you used to
paint houses with I believe with one
effective swab on the face dunked in
that you'll be good to go cut out a
few minutes at least as you can see this
dabbing nonsense takes time and you know
what I'm all about a shortcut so
painting stick dunk it in swipe it you
feel like you're on tinder
here we have the upper class of the
bananas certainly in the upper echelon
same sort of rules apply you know
whether it's the luxury banana or the
almond milk or lemon tart you know all
needs to be done we care stay between
the lines color for as long as you need
no time limit take your time
you know gets boring spice it up a
bit you know do it backwards upside down
with friends in the backyard you know
gets a tea mixed up we got the morph sir
she need a little bit of toilet paper as
well as a miniature broomstick now both
eyes same bit of toilet paper same bird
stick similar procedure to the coloring
and except for bit like backing up you
know when you used to have a grey lead
pencil couldn't color it in that you
know dark you'd have to do a bit of
shading in and around some areas same
sort of group now we are dealing awfully
close to the eyeball so whatever you do
no excessive force light touch is a must
you don't want to lose an eyeball so
whatever you do do please take your time
take as many precautions as you need if
you need a bigger sheet of toilet paper
you get a bigger sheet of toilet paper
you need a bigger brush get yourself a
bigger brush you need a putty pick your
nose
you pick your body nice just whatever
you do do not forget the toilet paper if
you're out use a hand towel a face
washer anything it'll catch up the blood
if you clip your eyeball here I've got
Harry Potter's Nimbus 2000 suck it's a
bit of a tall order but if you can find
the witch's broomstick use that
to color and that'll get the job done
now I'm not sure if you guys have
noticed but there's one thing that I
always carry with me when I'm doing my
makeup and it is my hockey puck it's
nice and light always fits in your
pocket and it's an absolute essential
 I look good products listed in
description as you can see that was like
one of those sneaky radio ads so they
just speed up things or put it in the
background so yeah if he's interested in
buying the products check out the
description wink-wink nudge-nudge this
next part I do for fun it's called the
tickle test Khloe's it batteries not
included
sorry about that guys anyway yes I'd
back to Mya makeup tutorial how the
do you think I look
check out these brows Wow
they looking mint aren't a god
I'm a good color in Iraq like I thought
eyebrows was just like a universal thing
that everyone had them but apparently
you got a drawer a mom whoa hold on a
second I think one of my eyelashes of
fell out
it's got whoa back take one step back
what the is I've just put glue on
my eyeball oh my gosh and I'm drawing on
a fake mustache and yep that is what I'm
doing now pull out your orange permanent
marker color in the bottom of your lip
you'll have one white mustache and one
orange bottom lip so continue on with
your highlighter
start coloring I've done a little white
there is a safety feature now in case
you get a bit of on your lip you'll
be able to see the orange oh I've just
completely gotten rid of the stripes I
don't know why I bothered in the first
place but you know you're just going to
color it in I don't see the point in
that one but we'll move forward now
we're gonna whip out the mascara you
know what that does get those lashes
looking nice and dark kill em up flick
them up you know like as you deserve it
don't forget your Eragon no one likes a
mozzie bite oops I just farted oh that
stings I'm really happy with that fart
