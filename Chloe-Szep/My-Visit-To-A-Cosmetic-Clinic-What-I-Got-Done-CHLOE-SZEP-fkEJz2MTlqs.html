so he'll look at you
so catches red we've got one for the
year one year has left flopped over in
the last two days and the other ear just
stays up gosh look at this look at the
camera I actually think it's the most
normal thing but anyway I'm just going
to be vlogging for the next couple of
days and show you guys what I get up to
so today I'm going to the Victorian
cosmetic Institute with Sharon so I'm
going to vlog all there and yeah just
see where the day's take me and I'm
going to bring you guys with why are you
crying
what's wrong so I'm wearing this bomber
jacket from H&amp;amp;M this tops just from the
W my boyfriend's but it's not so long so
I like it
these jeans from egg brand and when
she's out of that I'm ready to go
hi guys so we're in the car on the way
to the Victorian cosmetic Institute to
see dr. Chen we're here
in the scheme Department I actually have
a scar on the bottom of my chin that I'm
going to fix because when I was little I
split my chin open so he's going to fix
that up and not cosmetics it's only a
cosmetic procedure though isn't it yeah
they are going under the knife or
anything - no we're not doing that one
yes
no no stops or anything he's resigned on
major this is all non-surgical guys
dressed up well shows the old boiler
here so let's hang out in my very tender
age of 50 something's might go into that
yes now I figure bugger it after all
these years I'm exercising yet all those
years of exercising and eating well and
trying my hardest to look after myself I
figured bugger it why not shout myself
some skin treatments as well at
anti-wrinkle apparently is going to be
able to give me a little bit of skin
abrasion on the toe my lip said it'll
make it look like I fell off my bike to
be interesting cause I can't even ride a
bike it's probably very lucky I would
fall off mostly I just want to give it a
nice jab maybe get rid of some of these
horrible skin things that you get from
being old and getting your skin in the
Sun guys girls by the view stay out of
the Sun it is so bad for your skin
how gorgeous is my whole den I'm so
obsessed with it actually the best car
I've ever driven
my white Holden Astra
flew off a treatment start to say if you
have concerns on the farther I can get
you just a regular okay two three please
introduce yourself
I'm Gavin I'm cosmetic tough girl view
looking out for you today
yay okay we use golden caliper and we
should do some adjustment of your flanks
so the ratio between this side and this
side is always one to 1.618 which is the
coordination can use it to measure the
proportions you face so this to that guy
patty that would be you so certain
proportions and paints them to be you
know in this ratio so i'll measure your
eye to eye and i can tell you how long
an ocean beach in Hawaii mass to be all
that sort of thing again yeah with Kerry
but I mean this is just a guide so you
don't think it's not gospel that's
because from your eyes so looking at
your forehead for example look at that
one point six one eight times as you
know that's spot on
growling over there no I know no wonder
you look so good there you go perfect
brown the summit and the distance from
the mid brows but Pete with that one
which is same is between the items
buttocks
Wow now I reckon you my nerve is
slightly short night looking at it yes
bloody short so you could have a longer
known you gave a bit of mind clay you
don't want anymore like thank you
okay now this side now title spot-on
1.618 time difference between the eyes
okay and let's do the chin link that's
very nice for that so basically your
beauty proportion your forehead brow
mouth eyes chillin all perfect but maybe
it could be a little bit longer you
think feelings not a chance you should
maybe tell more lives
you got it pretty strong cheering muscle
as well put a little bit of the creation
of that hard work with your life that's
sort of a aesthetically you know we
could trim that down a bit now look nice
bit from dental to think people actual
experiment you could crack people good
but I am really just drama like taking
that muscles with you and getting really
strong so chewing garment bag yeah I
mean in long run finding someone who's
very strong jaw muscles like itself
really safe careful because you have to
build up enough are in this crack team
and it was cracking it died and you just
anyone to get that little
storms run with my grandparents house
they lived across the road and I tripped
on the driveway
scared of what to do pretty much put
your chin down for a minute look like a
manatee it's actually tilted the Skinner
Taylor I'll attach the underlying muscle
so putting a bit of Botox here and here
will help relax our muscle and stop the
skin from tethering in when you could
track the muscle so it also needs to be
separated so put a special needle and
you can try to separate that scar tissue
now so I'll try to make this experience
really good for you clothes thank you
Michael
I wasn't professional hand on the high
take a lie okay are you say pretty I'm
just drawing in the vein not mustache
come on I think he's just trying to
mustache and she would know gently
starting a bit over here just join the
veins I'm just got to do my best to
avoid the vein so we draw em all in and
that way we sort of know where to avoid
and where to go in shouldn't feel any of
this could be a pretty nom happily some
light threads through the upper lip
so so far so good not a lot of change it
and just a little bit more cooler than
that right upper lip now that's Marco
looks nothing to me
it looks beautiful you love that and the
vibration and I actually they travel at
the same their pathways paint so if you
overload is cold all the vibration you
don't feel the same that's amazing yeah
you can even earn that should in with
your honor do too much destroy them
mechanical natural it looks really
pretty yeah like I mean what you see now
is swollen as well so you know it it's
definitely going to settle down and
usually that's to to the person's you
know the
