routine firstly before I start my
workout routine I'm just going through
my hair up because I hate hair in my
face and whilst I'm working out and then
going to get changed into my crop pants
and top and at the door I go
firstly I'm going to start my workout
with a bit of a warm-up and today I've
ran to the path it's pretty close to my
house but it's still a good woman and I
just drove around the park for a while
and get myself warmed up I then take a
sneaky picture of my pump up out because
then you guys know that I'm doing a
workout
I love pump up because everyone supports
each other and it's just such a
motivational app you can just scroll
through your newsfeed and bam you get
motivated
when I'm working on specific parts of my
body I like to use the pump about
because they have some cool exercises
that you can do so today I just did my
core circuit and you guys can follow
you know when you guys are getting tied
it's just your mind so don't give in
these are some exercises of my Orion
that I like to do just on my legs and
mcbomb follow along if you would like
I love stretching and warming down
because I just feel like when I don't I
get really sore and then I can't work
out for a few days because my body is so
sore so if always essential to walk down
after your workout here's just a few
quick ones that I like to do before I
jog home and finish my workout
thank you guys so much for watching if
you'd like to download and follow me on
the pump up app my user name is Chloe is

really appreciate it and give it a
thumbs up if you like routine videos and
