out the last room in my house some of
you may know that I just moved to ask
about a month ago and I'm really really
keen to do a house tour
thanks to koala god bless them they sent
me a catch so I want to show you guys
the couch apparently you can put it
together in four minutes the whole couch
so I'm going to put myself up to the
challenge
and see if this actually works and kind
of review it for you guys and let's see
if we can put this up in four minutes
and then we'll decorate the space let's
go there's one of my spare rooms it's
literally just a mattress on the floor
with a couple of bedside tables this
room we wanted as like a bedroom I just
need to get a bed frame for that first
I'm and the other room we just want to
use as like a sitting room because we
all kind of work from home we want to
have it as another like nice space that
we can just go there do some work and
it's like a different area to the rest
of the house alright guys so I'm going
to start the timer now we've got four
minutes to put the whole couch together
let's go
start
all right so I have a minute 20 left
I've got the base together perfect what
time is it I would have had like 50
seconds left so 41 seconds left
Wow oh it lounges all together but is
that right so I've got a couple of
cushions and throws over here spin more
colorings there are my questions and my
throws then I'm just learning with my
plant to the corner here just there's a
little bit of something-something that I
put the little plant over there then
we've got speakers to listen to music
while we're working then the catch with
all the cushions and throw and we've got
likes and little boards here this needs
to be put up on the wall so yeah how
good is that you can easily fit a whole
body length light on here
and even two people next to each other
if you take the cushions off so when I
ordered this couch it came to me in four
hours so they have a four hour delivery
for Melbourne Sydney Perth and Brisbane
I also have if you don't like it you
have 129 to the side so this sofa comes
in this gray color and also a midnight
blue color so it's a three seater but
they'll be launching more seating
options soon and it does take four
minutes to assemble under four minutes I
assembled it in about three minutes and
ten seconds which is literally the most
convenient thing ever
so koala were absolute legends and I
want to thank them so much for checking
out this little space for us we
ouch it's just another nice space so
that we can relax in here and they gave
me a code for you guys so it's Chloe s
15 or 15% off orders over grand and I'm
gonna leave all of the information that
I just said in the description below I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I just
wanted to show you my last room in a
house and I asked what is coming very
soon this is literally all I had to do
and there's somebody got a bed for that
room but that's not even that important
I'm gonna show you guys my house very
very soon thanks guys for watching my
dogs have already got my ends on the
Koala toy
what are you doing with the toy show me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
