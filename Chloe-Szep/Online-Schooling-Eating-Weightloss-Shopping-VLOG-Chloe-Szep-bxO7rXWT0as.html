I'm just going below that double chin
today I'm just going to do a bit of a
vlog because I haven't blogged what I do
during the day in a long time so I'm
just going to have you guys follow me
around today I've completed one and a
half lessons of my online schooling so I
thought it would be cool to show you
guys what online schooling is like let's
take you to my class so at the moment I
am in my BCT lesson which is business
communication and Technology so this is
what the classes look like they can't
hear me unless I press talk so this is
basically the black okay so white boards
there which is where all the like
information goes on and then we just
talked about teacher in the chat that's
basically how it works pretty easy
that's what my online schooling looks
like it's really easy you guys ask me
lots of questions that online schooling
left the pros and cons I would say that
the pros are that you can obviously lay
in bed and I have my heater on right now
because it's freezing and just lay in
bed and do school work instead of
actually having to get out of bed go to
school that's hard thing so that would
definitely be a positive the day's don't
go for as long so at school you usually
there for like six hours right I do my
online schooling for about three hours a
day or four hours depending on how many
lessons I have the cons would be that
you have to be committed and you have to
do the work because you weren't passed
if you don't do the work
basically attending all your classes
sometimes I get a bit distracted and
don't attend all my classes why
something better will pop up and I'll be
like ah I can just watch that tutorial
later and then I never get around to
watching it you have to be committed
like honestly commitment is probably the
biggest thing and very organized I'm not
very organized but I do pass all my
subjects so I think my sister's picking
me up
about an hour and we're going to sushi
and she said be ready so look at me I'm
ready already I always get ready so
early
whatever sorry this is the outfit that
I'm wearing today this is just like a
jump art that I got from my I think it
was my idea it was mine
it was on sale for $60 and then 50% off
that so I got it for $30 which I'm so
happy with got this scarf from H&amp;amp;M for
$3 yeah $3 and then I have these
high-waisted panties and then my mature
shoes excuse my pronounce it Barry I got
these pants from pretty sure it was
general pants or the brand is nobody's
and they're extra high-waisted which I
love
that's my outfit for today I just wanted
to talk about a topic that I feel like
hits home base for a lot of people I've
been focusing on my help because I feel
like just eating healthy just makes me
feel so so so good I've been focusing on
like what I've been eating lately but
it's so hard like so this is what I ate
yesterday I'll give you an example I had
a smoothie for breakfast so it was
coconut water ice a frozen banana and
like a cup and a half of spinach I had
like a tiny little protein bar like this
big as a snack and then for lunch I had
a Kimura wrap with tuna spinach and
avocado and then I had like just water
until dinner I went to the gym and did
like 40 minutes of a workout I did ten
minutes like running for the whole 10
minutes on the treadmill and then I did
my own body exercises so like burpees
abs squats with the bars and stuff and
then I came home and I had a big piece
of fish with like veggies and then sweet
potato little cubes
burst it and that's all a be eating
really well but it's - I don't know how
to explain it
are you too much again white I eat too
little a still gangway like it's just so
frustrating when I'm eating fast food
I'm not the best food I feel like I'm
maintaining my weight just doing that
but then I know that it's not healthy
that I shouldn't be doing that yeah I
just feel like I needed to let that out
because it's such a struggle and I feel
like a lot of girls are struggling with
their weight and struggling with their
eating habits I'm always like
researching nutrition and stuff like
that and hormones like why we crave
stuff and I'm always just so interested
in that sort of thing but I just can't
seem to nail it on the head yeah that's
enough about white and that sheet my
sister is finally harm tight tank
okay this is Kate hello excuse me walk
straight through hopefully go to your
hand up
Kate's driving makes me see sorry we
went shopping Karen down and then we
went to independent Kate got some really
cool shoes I picked them out
what slopes of advances in you want
these are what I've added us
they're pretty cool and I got some stuff
from Becca a steel appellate and
I still i line on so did pretty well
sorry we just got home had a big day but
I have to do my maths assignment because
it's due on Friday and if I want to help
me I'll pay ya know
oh god I'm funny so now I'll just edit
to my video and pop it up for tonight
hope you enjoyed this vlog if you lack
blogs please give it a thumbs up so that
I have an idea of what videos you like
