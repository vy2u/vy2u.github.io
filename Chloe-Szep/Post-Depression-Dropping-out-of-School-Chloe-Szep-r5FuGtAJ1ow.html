the most amazing past week of Mines high
life I woke up at like 1:40 p.m. today
because I'm so tired from traveling and
everything so sad I was literally crying
for two hours last night because of how
sad I was it's just I can't even
describe it the feeling that I have
right now it's definitely post
depression for those of you who don't
know I just got back from the amplified
- I was their confidence Ani accompaning
accompanying Shaunie and I met some
amazing amazing people I also got up on
stage and talked to the guys in path I
was so so nervous and it was one of my
fears so I'm so happy about conquering
that fear you're not gonna grow anywhere
in your comfort zone so there you go I
got up on stage and I was on with Kurt
Coleman if you guys don't know Colin
he's honestly the most amazing person
I've ever met
we were saying by the airport yesterday
and shiny now with worth pulling your
eyes out because we just clicked so well
and my voice is shaken be some sad but
we all just clicked so well and I had
the best week of my life hands down if
you've never watched my channel I'm
Khloe's up and he'll lay there welcome
to you the best thing you've ever
discovered in your life just kidding but
welcome to my channel um I'm going to be
doing like a sit-down chit chat video
today because I haven't I don't think
I've done that one of those with you
yeah and I have a lot of things to catch
up on with you guys and I just want to
talk to you guys now what's been going
on lately um with schooling and just
stuff like that so I'm in grade 12 this
year right I finished like at school
last term so I did a time at my school I
went to a private Anglican college
school just isn't for me like I guess
there's a lot of people that love school
but that's just not me I stayed home
most of the time and did my work at home
so I was rarely going to school anyway
and my mom was paying a lot of money for
me to just sit at home and do my work so
we thought of a better idea for me
personally I'm not saying that other
people that will like this decision but
for me personally I feel like it's a
better decision for me because I don't
go to school much and I do my work at
home so it makes sense for me to start
doing an online education what it is is
it's just an online school and you do
your work like five days a week same as
school back at harm
there's a truck going past goodbye yeah
that's what I'm saying it's better for
me I can sit at home and do my
schoolwork I can get whatever else
someone done say film a video as well I
travel to school on a bus like an hour
there and an hour home so it's very
pointless but yeah so that is what I'm
doing from now on yes I won't be getting
it formal or graduation it's on your
mind I don't mind that's not a biggie
for me there's another truck go away
trying to film a video graduation it's
gonna be sad because I'm not gonna have
a problem grad but I guess that's life
and I choose the path that I'm choosing
then that's what comes with it I'm not
going to get the fall or the grad aspect
I excited to start it and see what it's
all about
and what it's like I think it'll be
better for me so yeah there you go
I am NOT a dropout but I am dropping out
of school
that doesn't really make sense but I
would drop that of school but I'm still
in school
whatever thank you for the people that
support my decision if you don't support
it then I'm sorry I don't really care
but thank you to the guys that do
support my decision because I honestly
means a lot to me and I love you guys so
much and thank you for the support it
means a lot to me sir I hope you guys
got a bit of knowledge in the enjoy what
I talk to you guys about today and I
will see you in my next video I think
I'm gonna just do a home when I bought
in Sydney and what I bought when I was
touring around Australia but this is one
of them I'm absolutely in love with this
it's a little cart and it's I think
because we're going into it I'm sorry
stay tuned for my whole um I'll see you
guys later
thank you so much for watching love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
