today's video is a question entity I
haven't done one of these in the longest
time so I'm really excited to do that
today don't forget if you're new here to
click that subscribe button I do weekly
vlogs every week and the occasional hold
the occasional let's sit down Jeff
type of a video Bob all right juicy
question number one that everyone wants
generic honestly had so many DMS and
start many questions asking about this
particular question what happened to
your car and I thought you're a home to
ambassador what happened okay
so long story short um I was a Holden
ambassador for a year
honestly nothing went wrong I just had
to have my car back sausage awesome
experience BM to be an ambassador for
Holden it was really fun I love to
methods to be asked her so much here you
guys are awesome you like if I would
still recommend the Astra yes I would
still recommend the asteroid such a GU
cock but my time is up with Holden and
we're moving on to bigger and better
things have you Mitchell ever been close
to breaking up and if so when yes one we
were once in Bali this quite a funny
story because I look back down on my
chloeís I should take hit but um I was
the only one I was like 17 and it was my
first holiday with my boyfriend
I really had a boyfriend before that we
don't really be dining the left six
months and we're in Bali and they can't
believe it really like pretty girls and
I was probably a little bit insecure
back then and I was like looking at
girls you know pay me any attention
why are you not giving me affection that
you like looking at other girls
literally soccer stats I'm never going
back on them actually cringing so I
thought um I was young and I was
insecure and that solution it all comes
down to you see you and Mitchell getting
married and having cubes yes I do in the
future I wish I could have a baby now to
be honest I was like to mention that I
think I'm already I think I'm ready to
have a baby is actually having babies is
like the one thing I wanted doing that
if I wasn't doing YouTube what job do I
think I would be doing okay so this is
one that I've been thinking of heaps
lately because I just like have come
across something that I'm really
passionate about and that I really love
doing I love like helping and healing
people in like a holistic way if that
makes sense I think if I wasn't doing
YouTube I'd love to be a naturopath or
like a nutritionist or something in the
health world when I was in high school I
wanted to be a paramedic
I changed my subjects before my age of
seven kicking off was it like making me
choose family for the first time this is
a juicy one so I met Mitchell at an
airport obviously we had some sushi
together and kuffar said that in one of
my last videos we follow each other in
the Instagram before that and then saw
each other at the airport caught up had
that sushi because obviously i lived in
queensland at the time and he was in
melbourne and he had a stopover from
hawaii sir we got some sushi together
and then I left you gotta see me I don't
know why my voice is shaking I left to
go to Sydney and he was like do you want
to come stay and meet my Emily and I was
literally six
at the time and I can tell you I was
like immersed for a good person in the
world and that probably kissed a couple
of boys and that's it um no mine held as
I lack even ready to on stated asked us
and made family I haven't even seen the
guy before this but it just like felt
normal
and we faced harder for ages and you
know it just felt kind of normal I
middle is them in FaceTime and I was
like well yeah I might go down and mum I
introduced mom to all of them on
FaceTime as well and I think it was
awkward there so I went down for a few
days and stayed there and the first
night I was there Mitchell was playing
football so he was going to training and
I actually set out the back with Sean
amok and it was like we can tip it going
into summer and we'll just kind of like
painting on the grass without clothes on
the robe just like having a chat and it
was really nice and then Sharon made one
of her infamous shoves his plan is and
we had like some wines and fled out
until much about her and then I had
dinner and then it wasn't like it wasn't
all good at all
it was like it just felt right and just
kind of flowed which is how I knew that
I was like spice to this mansion away
many Maitland is asking how do you stop
cravings during the day she cried two
chocolate 3 p.m. every day and build
this the nature what do you suggest to
do um what I do is I have like dark
chocolate in the fridge if I'm ever
feeling like tempted to eat chocolate I
go straight to the dark chocolate and
because it's not as nice you don't go
tempted to have a lot just start and
have it in your house how about a
licorice tea it's really quite sweet so
it takes away sweet cravings
Hayley trouble ice cream if you're
really feeling something chocolaty it's
a protein ice cream that I tend to grab
if I'm looking for a sweet treat to meet
you know fat much if so
how we get past them with dirt we have
our like occasional class I think it's
healthy to like fight occasionally in a
relationship obviously not all the time
but I think it's healthy to be able to
say that you're not happy with this and
be able to overcome it so that's what
meat should I do my breath pretty
open-minded understanding people so we
do have an issue we do approach in it
but the way in which we get possum is we
kind of come to like what one wants what
the other ones and like lean in the view
and then if that doesn't work we'll just
keep addressing the issue until it's
kind of gone it's more like fucking
marriage of things that we're finding
out now because it's like just a mess
the clean up your shit it sounds a
really good question actually do you
feel pressure from people on social
media to where things will look a
certain way or do you stick to who you
are and who you want to be I think there
really is a pressure on people with
social media to look a certain way and
they have to live up to that standard
but that is what comes with it oh if I
could choose one plastic surgery what
would it be in my favor choose one
plastic surgery it would be the bump on
my nose currently seeing that much but I
have like a weird nose so I'd probably
get a rhinoplasty if I could but like
gonna gonna accept what you give me I
guess or a big joke but like not messy
I'm just some really small groups I'd
probably go to like a c-cup like like
that would be ideal
to sever those fun little something to
eat anyway I'm going to end this video
