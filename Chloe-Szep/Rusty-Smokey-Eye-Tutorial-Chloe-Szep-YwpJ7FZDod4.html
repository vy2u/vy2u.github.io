just hit the camera
hi guys welcome back to my channel
excuse and shadow it is so annoying like
why does it have to be that honestly
tonight I've filmed for you guys this
will come right to you it's kind of just
like a rusty smirky on I don't really
know how to explain it
the main reason that I'm filming it is
because I wanted to try out my new still
a polyp and I've realized while filming
this video that I'm absolutely
absolutely obsessed this one is the eyes
of the window-shutters holland in mind
and just look at the colors play just
take a moment I think they're all mad
they're all beautiful colors and sub
Bassett I'm just obsessed anyway
if you'd like to see how I did that
please keep watching so to do the base
of the eye I'm just going to be using my
Napoleon potus eyeshadow brush and using
the color that color there it's cool
reason I'm just putting up a little
and then just going to be taking the
color wheat into my eye crease we're
just going to use my Mac two to four
brush I'm just going to take another
Napoleon blending brush sorry it's not
for concealer I'm using it to apply this
color here called perception to the lid
of my eye and then I'm just going to
take the other end of the brush and pop
it down there going to take the other
end of the brush again and the same
color perception and apply that under my
waterline about three-quarters of the
way around
if you want to darken up the crease you
can I'll do it now this is fine like how
it is I love how this is for the daytime
look but if you want to smoke it up for
the nighttime you could grab the color
brilliance and I'm this black color it's
like a dark grey and I'm just going to
grab the Mecca Kozma take a blending
brush it's quite tapered so it has a tip
on the end of it I'm just going to dab
that tip into the color brilliance and
put it in the crease just ever so
slightly
and I'm just going to grab my Mac - to
full blending brush all right then I'm
just going to go in with a liquid
eyeliner you don't have to do a liquid
eyeliner of it I tend to like doing with
the liquid eyeliners lately so I bought
a Stiller liner yesterday a liquid liner
at Mecca cosmetic car and it'll be my
first time trying it out so let's see
how it goes this is called Stila stay
all day waterproof liquid eyeliner in
intense black
do the flick I'm just going to tilt my
head up so I can see where my eyebrow
matches to the corner of my mind from
the end of the eyeliner just match it to
life around here that's how I find it
easiest to do my flicks I'm just going
to be using the Mac to run to SP brush
or under my waterline I'm just going to
be taking the dark gray or black color
brilliance into the mine palette and
applying that under my one
and they're just going to take the color
race in this one and just put it yeah
but my eyebrows are horrible Co my
eyelashes and I use the better than sex
toothpaste in the sky I love this
mascara sure sure good
I'm just going to take my Maybelline fit
me concealer in lot Lygia because my
sister happened to steal my Naz creamy
concealer
now I'm just going to take my Napoleon
perdus quad in number four and use the
color under my eyes taking my Mac to g4
brush and now for bronze I'm just going
to be using the NARS Laguna and just
taking my Napoleon Curtis like to ended
brush and using the contour and
now I'm just going to bronze my face up
with the doc deepest Mac mineralize
skinfinish stuff is seriously amazing
I'm just going to take my asado
Minoru baked blush in champagne diamond
and my Napoleon brush and just pluck my
cheeks
and because I have my eyebrows tattooed
I don't really do anything true them and
except I just put the Gimme brow by
benefit on my brows just to set them in
place so they don't move throughout in
the diary
well I paired my face now for my lips
I'm just going to be using the model
current lipliner illusion nude lip liner
just going to outline my lips
this coloring they added edges so that
it embraced eyelids
and I'll just take the Rimmel Kate
lipstick in the shade one 1/3 and apply
it to the middle
so that is the finished result of my
makeup today thank you guys so much for
