I have teamed up with sephora.com today
you yes Sephora has finally come to
Australia which is really exciting
because then I can finally get all these
goodies that I've always wanted today
I'm going to be showing you guys what I
got from Sephora the whole the year but
before I do that I just wanted to tell
you that they are having a huge Black
Friday sale this Friday on the 27th it
goes from 12 p.m. to 12 midnight on
Friday so don't miss out on that also I
have a discount code that you guys can
use it will appear on the screen here
it's bf - Chloe s so you can get a 10%
off however if you don't get in before
midnight or you miss the sales somehow
so I'm just going to get straight into
my haul video and show you guys some
goodies that I picked up from these
giant Sephora store the first product
that I got is the Tarte CC colored clay
primer I've been hunting for a good
primer and I just thought I'd try this
one out it's kind of in a stick form but
it it looks thick but it's not actually
that thick like it's just quite light
it's cruelty free and the mineral based
ingredients cancel earth redness and
pigmentation so that's plus secondly I
picked up the Make Up For Ever full
cover camouflage cream which is like a
concealer it's waterproof so that comes
in handy for summer which is around the
corner in Australia and I have it under
my eyes at the moment so I could show
you guys I love that it's waterproof
most concealers do go a bit funny after
a while and crease of it but users who
would approve it's obviously gonna stick
to your skin and stay there the next
product I picked up is the Becca
afterglow palette it has some amazed
in color see they're all extremely
pigmented and they're also mineral I'm
obsessed with the mineral event mineral
makeup at the moment I don't know why I
just feel like it goes better on my skin
and just feels better it doesn't feel
cakey or gross these are so versatile
because you can use them as like
highlighting bronzing and blushing or
you can use it as eyeshadow as well I'll
show you the piece and how pigmented
they are then I also picked up this
backup the one perfecting brush I am so
excited to use it I wanted to use it
today but I thought I'd keep it clean to
show you guys I think you could use this
for literally anything you could use it
to bronze up your body because it is
such a big brush you could use it
foundation it says on the package that
it's like goat hair so it doesn't seep
the product into the brush so you're not
wasting any product which i think is an
amazing idea I swear I waste half my
productions in the brush and the last
product that I picked up from the
Australian Sephora website is the
Anastasia Beverly Hills contour palette
Hunter Pitt South is yes it's in the
shade light to medium light to medium
this palette has been raved about on the
internet for a long time I have used the
banana shade under my eye today to set
the concealer and I just love it it's
exciting that that one is on the
Australian website because I have been
wanting it for a long time so that's the
end of this haul video I just picked up
a few products if you're interested to
get any of those then head over to
Sephora comdata√≠s you and you can pick
those up on the Black Friday sale on
Friday Black Friday sale
so that sale is from 12 p.m. to 12
midnight so don't miss it guys and don't
forget to check the description for
anything else that you were wanting to
know about the sale as well as my card I
hope you enjoyed and see you guys in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
