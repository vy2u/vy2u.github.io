so today's video is going to be one of
my favorite looks ever that I've always
always do it especially in the
summertime because it's glowy and bronzy
so I'm going to be doing a makeup look
so everything just fully bronzed out and
nice and 10 minutes so I'm going to
guard for a sheer look and then I slept
jewy-lookin the foundation and then like
a glossy lip because max is not so sweet
to to like a summery look I always tend
to go for the flosses or the shiny kind
of bleep because you kind of want to
look natural and you want your skin to
look like skin but you also want to look
nice and glowy and bronzed and beautiful
so let's just get straight into this
video and I'll show you step by step
what I do so firstly I'm just going to
be spraying my mac fix+
over my face just to make the foundation
sit a little bit better I guess so
that's done the foundation of which I'll
be using today is called the hourglass
illusion it's a skin tint so it's not
very heavy which is good for the summer
time and a day look just use a nice
fluffy brush to blend it in
I tend to just pop my hands organize an
issue and I'm just doing like a ski move
so when it's not heavy foundation just
to press it in because I'm not going to
be setting it it's just going to be a
nice tool I'm then going to use my
hourglass ambient palette this one is
like powdery illuminating it's kind of
like a highlight but I would prefer to
use it is more like a powder highlight
just because it's more on the powder
side if you can see that with a little
bit of a shine to it so this color just
in the places that I would usually
highlight
and because it's more of a powdery form
it's not sparkly
you can count it people put it anywhere
and then I'm just going to take the
pinkie runs in one the true top mix them
together and cheeks just to give myself
a little bit of color and now I'm going
to grab the main product that you're
probably need in this tutorial this is
my favorite product I ever ever ever
bought
it's my macro mineralized skinfinish in
dark deepest you can use about
everything I used by eyeshadow I use it
for bronze uh just everything I'm
basically going to be doing that all
over my face place that the Sun heats so
this area my forehead little bit on my
nose on my eyes but first I'm just going
through runs up into where I put the
block and then take it off around
I'm gonna use this brush to put it here
because you don't really need precision
doing this you can just blend it out
here and take tapping what I like about
this look is just sorry epicness
like really you can just build it up to
as much as you want until you think that
you have enough runs a baggie maybe two
I'd I think that's ever enough one so
the Sun hits this area or a lot because
comes out a bit more on me anyway
and then going to grab my Urban Decay
Naked illuminating trigger and I'm going
to use this color and this color so this
one's just going to go on top of the
outside yeah
and then the Twilight color is going to
go where my blush would go and I always
put my blush like all my temples as well
just to flush myself out just to make it
look like you've got a bit of color
everywhere now I'm going to grab my Mac
soft and gentle and I'm going to
illuminate so just up where you would
always do it when you're doing your
makeup really for this look you can't be
bronzed enough or illuminated enough
just chuck it
I live on the top you know where just
anywhere that you want to bring out so
for my lips to live them I'm going to
use a brown shade I'm pretty sure this
is an eye eyeliner but I'm using it for
my lips with makeup you can literally
use anything that anything it's an art
it's not really doesn't have rules I
don't think so oh boy honey look and
then you can also put I'm just going to
use my chubby clinic stick and they're
popping and poppy because I like to look
like it pinky shade in my lips and then
I'm going to grab my pull pull and just
tip it over the top so that's more sheer
lastly I'm going to grab my the ought a
at Wonderland mister I absolutely loved
it and again because it's like a summery
natural kind of Bronte look I don't do
eyeliner or anything like that
I kind of just stick to the basics and
do mascara lip gloss
runs up my collarbones
and then use my soft and gentle and just
so this is probably all I would do
personally for summary glowy
illuminating bronzy look it's naturally
beautiful and statement people could
have neck whoa look at that bronze
goddess gimme that
yeah girl so this is definitely my
favorite movie thank you guys for
watching this video and I hope you
enjoyed it take it into your summer
looks and just have fun with it
