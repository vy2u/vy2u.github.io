reverse out of the driveway how's the
sliding for you guys just gonna have to
work with it today Oh driving Mitchell's
basely car I always get scared driving
it is it's a messy I'm off to
I'm a life coach today so I wanted to
kind of vlog and tell you guys about it
it's Laura everyone very I can't say no
right ever I don't think I've ever said
no and we do but there's a really bad
belief see soon we're gonna get rid of
all of them no I know I attract people
that just tank
yeah that's me telling myself that you
know yeah I'm so limiting beliefs are
really really really good and bad so the
bad ones are the stuff that is really
really negative that you feel like is
limiting you you know these belief
systems you would have created when you
were
zero to five earlier if you believe in
past lives if you jump in it doesn't
matter it doesn't apply but if it does
yet it would probably came from then but
you it's basically a belief it's like a
thought that you think over and over and
over and over and over until it turns
into a belief and there's something you
believe yeah so for me I can't change
your belief system unless you allow me
to help you change it I have to like
through something like put them on my
Instagram or something I don't gonna
make me that's a no you don't have to do
that don't turn the camera off
so like daily affirmation in the morning
not an affirmation it's a decision
affirmation is just like oh yeah I'm
reminding myself to think about this
deciding is deciding it's a bit wanna
find my ear like I'm making that
decision it's gonna be a food I
don't care what happens I'm gonna have a
good day
some accepts do you say something
specific to yourself rewarding well
before I get a bit every night I think
to myself okay tomorrow is going to be
an amazing day I'm just like I know I
don't know how it's gonna be an amazing
day but it's gonna be really really good
yeah I wake up in the morning I say yet
today's gonna be a really really good
day I'm deciding that today is gonna be
a good day because everything is
decisions yeah
those belief systems remember how you
keep thinking the thought becomes easier
because it becomes a belief system you
know that means that after a few weeks
you're gonna decide that every day's a
good day new use for the so if I'm
having a bad day I go back home what do
I need to do right now that I have a
really good day yeah okay I'm gonna go
in the shops I'm gonna go buy myself
something that's gonna make me feel good
just for a couple who might be so silly
but it's gonna make me feel good and I'm
gonna have a bar I'm gonna do some
meditation I'm gonna
what if I go to the gym something so
that I would feel really really good
today because if you go to sleep at
night have you ever woken up in the
morning and your bra grabbed it and
you've just got to think we really
should take really bad today we have
done that yeah and then every single
time that you do something you haven't
got so you more evidence that today's
it'll be better I knew that I was you
know I knew I knew that was gonna be a
bad day today and then you go throughout
the rest of your day and you go oh no I
knew this was gonna be about I wish we
could just wipe the slate clean but then
if you woke up with that same principle
and you go you know what tasting a
really good day you're gonna go I knew
that was gonna be a really good day it
doesn't matter if I'm stuck in traffic
that means it gets listened to my
favorite music I knew it was gonna be a
good day I knew it
so the goals that I like people to write
down typically it depends how many you
want to do um I have weekly goals just
because I mean you know what it's like
being in business you could happily
always do buy something I don't know but
it's hardly I play get into this new
thing so it's I can you say your goals
at the end of every week at the
beginning of everybody beginning at the
end of every week I like to reflect back
and if I've done some really awesome
things I'm like sweet
I'm so happy with myself yeah I think I
am yeah and I am vibrant mm-hmm
I going high
so when did you decide you couldn't be
energetic so not freight people and I
said it's question second what he made
talked about to me ngo5 ego castle in
the baked yes
listen oh my god guys sorry um I just
went in in some Laura and she's so
amazing everything that like everything
was just a white lifted and she dog date
to the problem and that I became the
problem and didn't stop until we
overcame the problem honestly the
coolest like being a BA and it's really
helped me so I'm really excited
like I was super emotional as well which
she said is like me releasing negative
energy but yeah I feel like
fresh a good little bit of a weights
lifted off a big bit of a weights lifted
off
it's just all about positive thinking
and I would really recommend her if you
struggle with black positive thinking
and you feel like you're just a ball of
anxiety and a bully depression because
she's helped so many people that alike
that so I would really recommend her oh
