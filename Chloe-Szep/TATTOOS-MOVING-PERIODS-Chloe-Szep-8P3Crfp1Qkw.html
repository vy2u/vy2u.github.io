on Instagram let's just get straight
into answer Oh
first question Christi adopt leaves will
I get more tattoos yes I want to never
tell you I think I want um one on my
side or my hip I really love that
placement I don't know what I want to
get yet and I don't know what I'm gonna
get it but I know that I do want to know
the chatter oh by the way I have a new
background you guys like it Caitlyn
whisk me off ski Oh you polish as well
what's the meaning on your tattoo the
one on my back so squeaky chair so this
is how do here that is my parents birth
date in Roman numerals so my dad's on
the top
so my dad's on the top and my mom's is
on the bottom in Durham numerals join my
dad means like what the f you done and
almost like happy birthday and the one
on my chest or my tits imagine that when
I get pregnant stretch all right I'm 9 -
my boobs will sag over it um that one
has an hour significance it's just a
random tether that I got in Bali
compulsive Chloe back at it again I'll
show you that getting much easier the
squares so cheeky whose square is hurt
this chair is so squeaky I'm never on
the last step I was stuck there for 20
days what are we doing today it's
nothing to do so let's just good it's
that ocean picked it on the day and yeah
Mari underscore bury 16 where and when
did you and your boyfriend meet funny
thing we were well he had a two-hour
stopover in Brisbane and I was going to
see me so we happen to be at the airport
at the same time so we met up for sushi
and that's how we met Tia
demeanor said when I
plans for the future at the moment I
don't like planning true far ahead but
at the moment I've planned to move to
Melbourne so I just got a lease in
Brisbane so this is a six-month lease
and it's got about three months left so
probably like four months time I'll move
to Melbourne yeah I'm not gonna move in
with Mitra than his family or Mitchell
now like you're living together I'm just
going to move to Melbourne I kind of
just want a fresh start and to meet some
more people I love meeting new people I
was gonna move to see me but when I
moved to Melbourne my boyfriend's there
his family's there yeah so I'll probably
live in this city somewhere and yeah see
what happens whatever happens happens
and I'll just go with it Lauren
underscore s wants to know how I
maintain a long-distance relationship
ooh
well it's a bit important not gonna
lie it's a shitty situation you go from
like living with them for a week to
coming home and being like I'm so lonely
but you get on track a couple of days of
the back on track you find you just have
to find your routine again and as quick
as possible that's how I do it and a lot
of communication is good but it'll be so
much easier when we're in the same state
when we can see each other whenever
we're not gonna be in each other's hips
we'll still have our own lives and stuff
but it's just gonna be easy and not
having to pay for flights and having to
like you know you know you know Daily
News once you know how do I stay in
shape and what keeps me motivated love
you love you too
hey at the moment I'm really motivating
because I'm going to Bali in a month I
don't know I feel like that's keeping me
lit that's keeping me motivated at the
moment but you kind of just have to make
um make it a habit you have to do it
every day you just have to say to
yourself I'm gonna work out today
because
all right you just have to work out
everyday going out for dinners and stuff
with friends it makes it so much harder
it was eating social but whatever at
home I literally live off chicken
broccoli and rice and I just go to the
gym and that's how I kind of lose weight
by not having a social life dance and
under school Smith asked what videos
through I enjoy making the most I
definitely enjoy travel blogging vlogs
but of course I can't always make volume
once because I'm not traveling but I'm
looking back on them and thinking oh my
god that's such a fun holiday I think
I've watched those barley ones like ten
times each hour Abella underscore
Richardson says how long have you and
your boyfriend been dating we've been
dating for four months
Emma Thea Gert says how do I maintain
healthy hair but stay so blonde my
hairdressers are amazing I got a turning
guy so they always put treatments in it
and they use knife flicks to keep it
healthy when they're going blonde so I
think that helps a lot I've always had
like really thick strong hair so
whenever I've dyed it blonde it's white
it's just like handled it thank you very
much I've always been blonde and on my
roots are very light as you can see so
I'm pretty lucky in that sense Cara
underscore May 23 wants to know what my
go-to breakfast lunch and dinner is
breakfast I love acai bowls they're like
$14 each dose what steer clear of them
but I've been making my own lately and
they're very good um
lunch go to lunch could be chicken
broccoli and rice with barbecue sauce
and chicken stuffing that's my favorite
and then do not would probably be
lasagna I love lasagna favorite your aim
is Sabella says are you planning to do
any more columns in the future I'd love
to collab but I just don't know who to
call up with in the comments guys tell
me who I should collab with Malwa maka
table one wants to know what would I be
doing if I wasn't doing YouTube um I was
going to study paramedics because I
always just wanted to paramedics I
changed all my subjects for paramedics
but I got to a stage in grade 12 rounds
like if I study for four more years I'm
going to shoot myself other that stage
was like this is getting ridiculous so I
just want to have a break for a bit I
could always go back and study it but
who knows what knows where knows do an
oval mention me in a comment and I bet
you it's going to be a scary comment I
bet it's something something scary a
hundred thousand percent is it gonna be
scary it's gonna be yeah how to make a
Maltese and cheesecake if you're big fan
of Maltesers

obsessive Maltese as it's actually an
addiction den Vienna and Elise says

turn dollar straight way underscore Sara
said what is the worst period moment so
I was getting my nails done with
Mitchell's mom and I got up from the

had white high-waisted tracksuit kind of
pants on
fashionable tracksuit pants I got up
went to go pay for my nails everything
was fine and a lady goes your pants
dirty and I was like what black hole
numb and I was like all right they're
pretty clean to me
buddy-buddy clean I just wash them she
goes no you have blood on your pant and
also so I looked behind that was a big
blood stain on the back of my pants so
Sharon gave me her wallet and I put it
over the back of my pants and I walked
out like nothing happened
