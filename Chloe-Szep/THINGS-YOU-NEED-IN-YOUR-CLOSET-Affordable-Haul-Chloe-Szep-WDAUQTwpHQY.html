today's video I'm going to be doing
another whole video you know how much I
love my whole videos I would film them
every day if I could
but today's whole video is something I
learned while I was doing styling and
like doing at people's wardrobes and
stuff I learned that you have to have
Basics in your cupboard so basic
t-shirts basic singlets just basic
things that you can wear with different
sorts of skirts and jeans and skirts
skirts skirts jeans and black shorts
justice staples that you can pair with
the cool things that you buy so yeah I
just wanted to film a video and kind of
do something that everybody should have
in their wardrobe I teamed up with MRP
calm because I was searching around for
awhile and they had really cheap clothes
and cheap basics you don't want to go
spending and I'm gonna leg on basic
clothes because you want four different
colors in like one tee and you don't
want to spend $50 on the t-shirt because
that ends up being like $200 for four
t-shirts
yeah I thought I'd keep this whole very
affordable and good quality let's just
get on with this video I'm gonna start
trying everything on so yeah let's get
into this video okay so this is my first
top it's just a t-shirt top with a
slight v-neck it's got a really nice
back so super cute detail in the back
you tie it up here and the rest of the
back is kind of drop and backless so
this is an example of a really cute top
that you should just have in your
wardrobe it'll come in handy when you're
wearing skirts and stuff and put a pair
a nice boots on with it and you're ready
to go for a summer day or if you want to
add a cart look beautiful for winter
this is top number one okay so this is
number two it's just a little black tank
top it's got a knot at the front for a
little bit of detail
just to show a little bit of waste and
yeah just a really simple black tank
that you can wear with literally
anything then this is top number three
this has really cute sleeves so they
flare out a little bit and it's a
different kind of material so that gives
this top a little bit of detail even
though it's basic it still has that
little bit of detail which is what you
want in a dog you can also tie this one
up that'll look super cute as well keep
this one it's a really cute color that
cropped tees there you can wear with
anything in summer that would look so so
cute it has a little bit of detail
around the edges otherwise they've
materials super comfy and just matches a
lot of things that looks perfect with
this white skirt I also got it in a pink
which I'll put on right now this is it
in the pink how cute are these tops I
really love it
oh they say I'm gonna wear black wrong
with this because it's kind of cool and
I just got a basic white team with a
little pocket in the corner this will
come in handy is so much because you can
literally wear it with anything you want
literally anything so you know just a
plain white tee everyone needs one of
these in their cupboard next I got a
similar top to the black one so you can
just tie it up this one has a little
pocket as well so just another little
bit of detail but super basic tank that
you can literally wear with anything
then I just picked up this Lucius Lucius
Lewis is got a t-shirt so cute you can
also tie it as well this top has little
holes in it so that's the detail on this
one so cute as well so this is just a
plain seeing that it's got little grey
stripes across there so this is really
cute with just this coat looks perfect
for that with some slides would be
perfect
everybody needs a couple of single if I
also got this one in black then I got
this cute
little bralette so you can wear a top
over that this as well but this looks
really cute by itself you could put a
jacket over it as well which would look
cute it's just a little Lacey great
bralette next up we have some body con
dresses so these are just really cute
for winter with just a jacket over them
and some boots I got this one in gray
black and white and just plain black
these are really good to have in a few
colors because they're really really
versatile so yeah I think everyone needs
a couple of body con dresses in their
wardrobe then I got another bodycon
dress I don't really like straps that go
around this way they make you book a
little bit bigger but this is still
really cute for like a summer day if
you're just in bikinis and you just
going to chuck something over the top so
it goes down to about here and it has
little slits in the side somebody is
calling my then I also got a little
place ooty thing this is like a dress
but it clinches at the waist which is so
cute I really really really loved this
one for holidays and just going away
just to chuckling just summertime really
cute summery dress last but not least I
bought this little play suit again this
is so cute for summer just to chuck on
and just literally you can wear it
around the house you can wear it to the
shops you wrote at the beach this is so
versatile as well as the one I prone
before they're really cute and I also
just got a bunch of undies some little
like cheese strings so that's the end of
this whole video I hope you guys enjoyed
it and got a little bit of tips or just
some clothes that you could have in your
cupboard don't forget I shopped on MRP
