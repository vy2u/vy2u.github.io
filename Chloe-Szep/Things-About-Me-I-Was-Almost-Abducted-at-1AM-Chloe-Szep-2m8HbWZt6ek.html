channel I'm closer Piznarski and today's
video is going to be a 32 facts about me
I don't know why it's 32 don't ask but
that's all I could come up with sides
notice new facts about me hey at least
it is an even number odd number maybe I
could question it but even so 32 facts
than me I'm just going to get straight
into it so please enjoy number one I'm a
serious people please up I will
literally go out of my way to please
people
dude I've never had a serious boyfriend
or relationship I'm addicted to sweet
food cuddles are literally my favorite
thing ever
I crave cuddles I love curling I love
acting in fact one day I would love to
be an actress
seriously I freaking love acting I am a
stage time clinger ask my friends I'm
179 centimeters tall
I can never plan anything because I will
never stick to it I just don't like
learning things because I know that I
will change the plan so don't play with
me this is a 99% chance that we weren't
even hangout I am literally the worst
texture in the world texture saving a
word I don't care I suck and texting I
will replace your how are you a week
later I literally record everything like
I will just be sitting there with my
friend and talking and I'll just record
us because something funny might happen
I have no shame which can sometimes be
bad because I will literally do anything
to make anyone laugh and yeah I just
don't get embarrassed if I could travel
for the rest of my life I would I'm that
person it takes everything a step too
far I eat a lot and when I say what I
mean a lot I love meeting new people and
making new friends so come talk to me
people I love to talk and stupid accent
that's what she back sent us in English
but I love to talk in accents laughs so
there you go my parents are separated
not divorced but separated I am lazy but
I'm ambitious which is the worst mix
because I will want to be somewhere but
I'm too lazy to get there so well I am
an extremely social person I have to be
around someone 24/7 and that is probably
why I'm such a clinger because I like to
be around people all the time I want to
learn to play guitar I love being saw
after your workout I have two massive
bruises on each bone cheek from getting
the iron injections just thought you'd
like to know that beautiful things
inspire me that flower outside sin
scarring me it's very pretty I was born
at 10:29
at night maybe that's why I'm such a
night person I will stay up all night
I've always wanted to be a TV reporter
welcome to Channel 9 News
my name is Chloe Zepa norske and you are
joining us on the weather
I may need a bit train I have this weird
phobia and I'm extremely afraid of
insects flying into my ears while I'm
sleeping and laying eggs yeah I went on
anxiety tablets because I couldn't go
outside because I was afraid of getting
abducted
I have snuck out before and I got chased
and when I sound got chased I mean a man
literally sprinted up to me for 500
meters when I go back to my friend's
house I vomited off of her balcony
because I ran that fast and my dude this
was it 1 o'clock in the morning so I'm
99% sure that the reason I want anxiety
pills or the fear of being abducted is
because I nearly was abducted at one
o'clock in the morning never will I
sneak out again ever nipple is my
favorite sport and I used to Train like
4 times a week and play twice every
Saturday maybe that's far so feedback
then I love filming at YouTube videos
like I actually love doing it but I'm so
lazy so I never get that motivation to
actually feel but it's coming it's
slowly coming thank God last but not
least I love you guys surprise surprise
so yeah that's the end of 32 things
about me I don't know if it was 32 but
whatever we'll see I hope you guys
enjoyed and got to know me a little bit
more and I will see you guys in my next
