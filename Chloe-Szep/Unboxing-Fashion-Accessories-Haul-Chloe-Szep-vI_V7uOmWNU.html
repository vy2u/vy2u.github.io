channel my name is Claudette and today's
video is going to be possible to do I
got a super super awesome package from
this bit which is a brand generally self
five days of the month and that is why
sorry I'm going to show you what I got
in them and if you like to be the
fearless what team artist so firstly I'm
going to show you guys the watches that
I love and the dutiful packaging at home
red velvet with bottom of the box the
same time so this is the first one that
I have
put the rifle teach as true Rosalee
concept that Q is a bit different
teaching them and then we've got you're
going to kinetic details so in
cyberspace there's like the about
eyewear mainly silver jury so I cannot
just all of my direct result of put it
all together it comes with another band
fans are interchangeable and already has
the future click this little side and
then come back too many have a white man
purse good
it depends between is one and the other
parasol and peach watch is that it
doesn't have to interchange your arm
bands are a little bit different to
later and some really stitching in the
band and cover around the outside is not
those aware of all the various masks
instead of being shiny like if I'm shiny
that's the difference between these two
another work with an extremum and it
will
so it's cool black is fully matte black
it has the silver hand they're the only
difference between the band is that this
was a long shiny that's the most genuine
level top electrical definite decision
and then next I got a journal need to
jot down everything I think
on my video I did this is source here so
they have a little chrome only last
until the urbanist it says in your deck
school bag will decide your been some
less the source document
memories and dreams and insulting day as
I canards will be as empty heads away
orphan angeling waiting to see you to
write down in May to the snap on to and
then it says time to and then at the end
of the book
currently
time to see things I want to spend time
to do
chop chop how to reflect things and
great personal time to inspire will
welcome going to be known for time to
celebrate simply proud next time on the
cooler side or it's genuine lava to be
wonderful at uni through period or for
me I take a stance packed in my carrier
and then it has a beautiful problem with
Jamaica and then it has holy water
douche bag event v children like me I'm
a bit of a some facility left me
bhagava another little compartment back
a little bit and you can time it look
easy so Ruth to my Johnson and then
Lofton at least I got the sunglasses are
the glasses handmade easily the ball if
you do work with the Romans being it is
the other side are you ready how good is
that good petal dust the heavy rifle on
the outside with the darker one and then
there the total of the curtains of
Prince knee outward master teeth
the Roseville home in the black wash
messes the backpack folks
and pop this on the phone going and so
guys if you want to buy something from
at the fifth they only sold five days of
