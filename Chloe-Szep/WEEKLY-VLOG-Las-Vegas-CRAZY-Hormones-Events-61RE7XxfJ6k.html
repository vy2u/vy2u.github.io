leash loose crying the whole time
to Tyson
shots
we're staying at the cosmo and we're
just going out for dinner I'm gonna be
the head Cod so I'm gonna go get some
things from the pharmacy to clear it off
the Vegas is so cool
second strip
Marty
the anti affectionate fuckers hey guys
oh my god it's so so sorry good to be
back home from America I love traveling
don't get me wrong I'm so like lucky to
be able to travel and see the world and
garda Coachella which was essentially
the best time of my life um go to Vegas
do all that fun stuff but as you can
tell my whole like what he gets impacted
from like going away and eating bad food
again
look at my skin honestly it's so bad and
I just don't know what to do and I look
in the mirror every day and I'm like oh
my god it's just worth anyway I'm going
through my naturopath I went to her like
a year ago I'm about to go back to her
after a year and I can't wait to fill
her in on everything and just like um
last she was like the beginning of my
problems and now they're just bad I just
heard like something with onion in it
and I feel so fucking sick everything I
ate makes me feel sick and I'm sick of
it
so that is why I'm going to my touch
pots today I'm gonna like sort all my
insides out I'm going to get my hormones
here get my hormones back on track and
my gut health I honestly think that
everything that is happening to me is
because of my gut health and if I don't
have that good gut flora then it just
upsets everything so I just went and saw
my naturopath who I haven't seen for
ages and I literally was crying the
whole time I think it's because my
health it just keeps going like down
down down and my body's just getting so
sick of it or I'm at have like a
breakdown we're like targeting balancing
my hormones my liver function in
detoxification
my adrenal glands and managing stress
because of the work I do I never get
time to switch off like I'm always like
filming my life I never have downtime I
never have that work-life balance
because work is my life basically and
it's really hard to UM keep up with that
and she's just saying how I need to set
times to just relax and not have to be
in that work headspace whereas now every
every time I get a second I'm like I
have to do work I have to do work like
now I'm like fill me which is work
because I want to tell you guys what
happened but you know what I mean like
I'm crossing my life with my work but
I'm literally so blessed to be able to
do this job that I want to do that but
sometimes my body can't keep up with the
stress and like Iowa I'm always thinking
that I have to do something more and
yeah I'm honestly so lucky to be able to
do what I do and have you guys like
follow my journey but obviously with a
part of my journey there is gonna be
down time like this and I just need to
like manage my time a lot better but
it's a start
and once I'm my body is healed and my
catching up to me I'll be fine and like
so I'm gonna keep you guys completely
updated with this because I think it's
really quite interesting and a lot of us
have body issues that are just thought
to be normal in everyday life but like
stress is a really really bad bad thing
to have because it affects your body so
much so I just wanted to tell you guys
that I'm going to get my skin treated
now because obviously it's looking a
little bit crazy oh my gosh it's need
redoing as well I'm just a mess at the
moment anyway guys oh come back and
hey Luke I'm here at nxp head office
just trying to keep their amazing
clothes for the event on Friday
oh these lovely gal yeah sorry Eloise
and I up to there and XP event the Nina
pasadena event launch of the new season
that bus is fully overriding my voice
right now
whoa
so we just got home from the NXP event
being Nana's in bed having a little
sleepover tonight with a cup of tea and
this is both of our favorite mm-hmm if
you wanted a little insight hey guys I
just wanted to check in I haven't
blogged since the other night but um I
haven't really done much I just went to
the gym and it made some protein
pancakes it home I'm gonna get my nails
done cuz this is what we're dealing with
what is that hey guys a wound her by
myself my roommate just left I just
wanted to quickly film this and say that
I am I'm doing well
editing my blog and I was like oh my god
Khloe is so dramatic
yes like two weeks ago I was feeling
really really shit as I've gotten back
from America I'd eaten shit and that
eaten shit and drink alcohol for like
two weeks straight not a good
combination especially when you're like
intolerant to weight thing in America
everything is made from wheat so that's
why my skin was so aggravated I mean
it's like good now but it's better than
it was but I wanted to say that I'm a
little bit on track I had my period and
before my period I'm honestly the most
emotional wreck ever so this is where
I'm trying to get sorted like two weeks
before my period I get the worst side
effects
I get bloating like I'm pregnant my pain
while I'm on my period is oh my god
this world that's why I like to do
things like go to the gym and like get
moving because it does help me
personally if you guys don't follow mine
set feet go follow it I'm actually doing
a challenge at the moment trying to do a
headstand without a wall behind me so if
you want to UM see the progress and not
to go follow minds that bit back to what
I was saying um I've been taking
probiotics aletter you asked for what
supplements I've been taking I've been
taking probiotics apple cider vinegar
with water in the morning just to like a
detox a little bit agreement powder
which is really hard to get down but
gonna do what you're gonna do
I'm taking a men's stroke hair tablet
which balances out my hormones a little
bit but I'm waiting till day 19 of my
cycle to do this test to tell me what's
actually up with my hormones and how
much estrogen I have and testosterone
and done last time I had this test I had
high testosterone which is why I've got
polycystic ovaries if you didn't know
how polycystic ovaries which explains a
lot of my side effects as well but yeah
I'm actually doing really well things
that people think are okay everyday I
recommend if you like a stressed person
to go and get a little bit of help and
getting help doesn't mean like you're
you have some sort of mental illness it
just means like you want to take charge
your body and feel the best that you can
because why would you want to go through
life feeling miserable you want to feel
the best that you can and I'm all about
promoting feeling good in your own body
and just like feeling good daily anyway
guys I wanted to say thank you so much
for watching see you and I'll see and my
next weekly vlog which I'm super excited
about I've got a couple of holes coming
up because a few people have recommended
in my DMS to do more fashion haul videos
so I got you I'm gonna be doing them in
the coming weeks
anyway I love you guys and thanks for
supporting me and being on this journey
