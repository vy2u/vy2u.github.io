hi guys I just got back from the gym I
did a quick I'm an ab workout my health
so orange at the moment I'm going back
from dark to blonde heaps of people have
asked me why when I was brunette I felt
like when I didn't wear makeup I felt
like I was a little bit washed out and
like I had to wear makeup to make it
look good
whereas when I was blonde I could get
away with not wearing makeup and not
looking pale so that's like the main
reason and I'm going to Coachella and I
really want to have like white hair for
Coachella I don't even know if we'll be
able to get back to that color I'm just
eating some tuna avocado rice and sweet
chili sauce I had quite a productive day

why the dogs have been in any of my
snapchats or anything like that so we
got this house that we applied for and
basically Michy's parents had dogs
because we knew that like dogs and
Aladdin rentals we asked them if we
could have them back just to see if they
would say yes and because Mitchell's
parents are going to be selling and
stuff and they said yes so we have to
pay a true grand pet bond but we get it
