god they both coming to join welcome
back to my channel so I thought I would
film a bit of a video today I'm about to
go to the gym I haven't really done a
gym video for a while so I thought maybe
I would film my work out of the gym and
just tell you a few things about what's
going on with me at the moment so
nothing's going on with me actually I
just went and got my blood test results
I went and got them done about a week
ago at this place that does all of your
hormone testing it's like three hundred
and fifty dollars and you test pretty
much everything this is really
embarrassing because I honestly thought
that something was wrong with my
hormones like I thought surely they're a
little bit out of whack or something
like give me something to blame my moods
on you're like what are you going what
about mum seriously shut up anyway went
back today to see what was wrong with me
supposedly there's nothing wrong with me
my levels are perfect how does that how
does one explain that to their boyfriend
who thinks that they're crazy because of
their hormones because I'm always like
Mitch it's my hormones you have to
understand the lady said to me you
really
you weren't hydrated at all when you
came in when I got my blood tests done
so maybe last week I was feeling
extremely lethargic because I didn't
drink much water I remembered now that I
actually had no water I really did not
drink much water and maybe that is the
root of my problem is that I'm not
drinking Oh
hydrating myself enough anyway enough of
me babbling on let's just go to the gym
let's have something to eat and wow
really full asleep
am I not boring sorry lil enough oh my
god he's sick
the Haake just gonna make myself some
lunch before I do anything
chicken cheese and mayo lies on some
sweet potato wraps so before I go to a
gym I like to plan at my workouts before
I got I like to plan what body part I'm
doing what exercises I'm doing the reps
such as so then I don't get to the gym
and sit there and I'm like okay what am
I gonna do because that used to happen
to me a lot
so to save that I write up my workouts
the Fragger am i doing a full body so
we're doing our legs then our shoulders
then our legs and bomb and then biceps
and triceps sorry I'm ready to go to the
gym just got changed into my gym clothes
and I've got my little brown cool stuff
they are my pregame chance to pump me up
a little bit
 I feel like the gym is packed and
I'm gonna be recording myself it's
always a bit of awkward but it's fine
we'll be fine before I start my workout
I'm just gonna share with you these
headphones that I got they have a twenty
two hour battery like I actually haven't
charged these since I got them and I've
had them for a couple of weeks because
they've just lasted for so long and they
run out it literally takes ten minutes
and it charges for four hours of battery
so you only have to chuck it on charge
for ten minutes if you're running out
the door that's why I'm obsessed with
these babies and they're also wireless
so how good is that and I've found that
when I do hit workouts like cardio based
stuff like burpees they don't fall off
my head whereas in the past I've had
wireless headphones that have fallen off
my head no just wanted to tell you guys
about them they're from Skull Candy
they're the Hesh 3 wireless headphones
so if you want to get your hands on some
I can link them below and holy heck I'm
really hot right now so I'm gonna go to
the gym in the aircon
do you negate the pakis come on come on
ready oh yes come on Lola to the park I
just found the cutest part it's all
fenced off which is good but this a
cricket game going on excuse me looking
bald and like a boy I'm gonna end this
log here thank you guys so much for
watching if you enjoyed this video
