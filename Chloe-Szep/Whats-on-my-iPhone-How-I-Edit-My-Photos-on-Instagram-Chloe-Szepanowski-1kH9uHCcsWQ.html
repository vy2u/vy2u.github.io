today I'm going to be filming or what's
on my iPhone video um and how I edit my
images on Instagram and Facebook etc you
know my jokes disgusting oh yeah okay so
let's get into showing you what's my
phone and how I edit my photos okay so
this is my phone it is an iPhone 5s this
is my background it's just a quote
saying be strong enough to let go and
wise enough to wait around for what you
deserves this is my background
it's just shiny and I and I have all my
apps in little folders I go over here
and I've got my photography so I've got
how like what I edit my photos to be the
way to Graham and visco you can I don't
know if it's vsco cam or the escrow cam
I'll never know and then there's also my
photo reason that I then have an oh like
a folder for my music so I have I use
this app called Musa fire and I search
my songs through there and then they
download whoops to here it's really
annoying because ads always come up but
when I'm in need of the song I just
download it there I also have all my
music there I've only got 35 songs and
that album
this is just like insta follower I don't
even know I have that I used to use it
then not anymore
and I also have fantastic which I frame
my photos within then camera I then have
luck my finance stuff I don't know why
it's under finance but I have like my
banking so I do my online banking on
there I then have like Safari and then
my emails I then have like my messages
down here because it's what I use the
most
oops so my messages
and then I have my like social media
that I always use so I have Twitter
Tumblr YouTube Instagram Facebook
snapchat and messenger so that's
basically my phone how it's set out I
will now show you how I edit my photos
so I go into the ESCO cam this is my
library so I have just random photos in
here I then go to so in my library and
then you go to add a photo this one so
you tap that and then do the middle
button we've got many different edits so
if I'm feeling black and white I'll do
black and white
the main edits that I use is f2 I turn
it down to about there and then I go to
the brightness and I turn that down
about 1 and then if the contrast needs
adjusting I'll do that I never really
turn contrast down are usually just
score like up one or stay the same I'll
straighten it if it's not fully straight
to the camera which this photo is pretty
straight to the camera we'll save it to
my camera roll and then I go to wider
Graham and I go to choose existing then
to my recently added get that one and if
I don't like see and black sometimes
I'll flip it to see if it looks better
flipped but I don't think it looks
better flip today so I'll leave it like
that
and then I save it to full resolution
and that is how I edit my pictures that
is what is on my phone and how I edit my
photos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
