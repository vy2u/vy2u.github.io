today I'm doing a white bucks boutique
fashion haul not gonna lie I did just
get back from gym and I looked on the
kitchen bench and I was like oh my god I
have to hold my wife what screw teeth
because I want everyone to see the
goodies that I got so that's what I'm
going to be doing it for you guys today
still in my gym gear this is actually
why foots boutique as well how bloody
cute is this it's some white folks
acting may I say this is the red set are
we squat proof yes I am kneeling right
now we can I set up my camera and I
don't want to raise
anyway guys I'm just going to get
straight into this haul because I want
to show you everything and I'm really
really excited to show you all the stuff
I've got I've like put everything out in
outfits on the floor so I'm a little bit
excited I do just want to let you guys
know before we start in case you're
lacking in the items I will mention it
at the end as well but I've managed to
get you a 15% off in the herd of
elephants cash in Lola sit down my code
is Chloe zip for 15% off site-wide which
is amazing so apply that at your own
check out and you get a super sinner
alright so this is my next outfit I am
literally obsessed with these little
tops I got it in black as well but sorry
sorry look at the back it's like the
backless
I'm obsessed it's a really good material
it sits really well and supports your
boobs so I only have small boobs but I
feel like if you have little bit bigger
boobs it would still fit you
he might just move up a size I paired up
with these cargo pants anything can go
eight the merman is so mean so I got
these in a medium that I've gone to a
small these are like a light blue kind
of color really really cute I paired
this with my Nike Air Force One shoes
and maybe like a belt bag or even like
about would look really cute and like
even if fur over your shoulders would
look really nice as well
oh my god I love this outfit so much me
ha my firm is in the speaker so this top
once again I am with the back of this
top this is just in a black color
instead and then these pants are so cool
I love them so much
these are copper pants I really love
this outfit you could wear it with heels
and also a little belt bag like a black
belt bags would look really really cute
with this I feel and the quality of
these pants are amazing
I am really really awesome quality
honestly when I'm shopping you bear
Takes I'm like huh quality quality but
white box has insane quality that
t-shirts are really good quality
they're like jumper dresses then knits
I'm going to show you a few of them in a
sphere but I just wanted to let you know
that it is really really good quality
and wonder I got you girl
I would never lie to you about that
quality is really really good let's go
to the next sorry
this is in the next outfit this is the
top I was talking about when I say
really really amazing quality I love the
quality of this talk sir it's like a
banty buck crop to the futile splits at
the top start I've just paired it with a
little denim skirt this is the medium
but it's a little bit too big on me I
think I'd be perfect with the small once
again but I just wanted to show you guys
everything I could easily worry about
with this because it's not that much
bigger but just the size reference if
you were wondering you could put these
with a gray fur over the top just over
your shoulders because it's winter with
some nice boots that would look
jeans and emit such as standard winter
outfit just casual standard vibes this
knit is really really cool it's bit
oversized and it's cropped at the same
time which I love and then it looks
really cozy you could put a nice scarf
on with this the material of this is
really nice it's a little bit stretchy
it is comfy not itchy at all
it's not an itchy material and I just
paired it with some black jeans these
black jeans are really good fit they're
kind of mid waisted I would say they're
not like high high but they're quite
stretchy which is great I love it this
knit as well it's a little bit more on
the crop so this one's really comfy it's
a little bit tighter around here and
then it goes loose oh yeah but scoops
out the front which is quite flattering
it's a bit of a different movie material
to the other one it's a little bit more
fairy if you can tell that but dogs are
kind to try anything so this is just a
cute little light ski be kinda top
really versatile it has kind of a
turtleneck I would wear a really nice
coat with this with some jeans and boots
and maybe a scarf so it's more of like
an under piece that you can pair with
other things and layer on top off it's
super comfy it's not itchy at all it's
like a really nice cozy material it's a
bit more of a matte material stop me
cutting for God's sake what mom I feel
like I have maybe children right now
I love love love this dress it is the
most comfortable cute dress ever really
comfortable because it's kind of Farkas
sized so you can let that blood guard
and the material is really really really
nice as well it's like kind of a neat
but Lala it's kind of like a knitted
material but also quite thick as well
yeah this is the same but in the orange
I love this color it's so bright and
pretty and you can pair it with a long
trench coat with some bits
I love these through these are honestly
totally my favorite truth that I got
because they just really cozy and comfy
and easy to wear and versatile this one
is so cute as well it's got kind of the
puffy sleeve it's a little bit different
of material it's not as like fluffy on
the inside I love layering and I was
like a nice dress and various trench car
let's go really looks fast
and these staple look basic dresses
really come in handy for you because you
literally just layer them and you can
pull them out of your head you can wear
them a heat the different times in that
different styles
this one is more of an oversized t-shirt
so you could pair it with the denim
skirt as well and just let it hang over
or you could put up with jeans a nice
link art or if I were to get it in like
a large I would just wear it as a dress
because it's a cute style but it has
those rips in it once again just do a
little bit of a different pattern on the
front the cool snake there that is my
last outfit that I'm going to show you
guys today
