just a pair of black jeans or white
jeans and they just literally go with
everything should have a big foot next I
got um this wrap skirt so we wrap it
around to however tight and it's just
like an asymmetrical steps good I'm
pretty sure it's called asymmetrical

skirts
uh an old round or serve this bottom
will come in handy good for festivals as
well I really dig this myself
next I got this dress I also got it in
white it's just so simple if you get
cold I just put a jacket over it or I
can just chuck a pair of boots for that
and it's literally the comfiest material
I'm such a big person on basic kind of
clothing selectee shirts and oversized
tees baggy having jumpers and I just
pair up with a pair of added ass or
something I made the dress to the nines
all true the ones wanting to the scale
of the other there's no in-between
then grab this mint it's just like a
plain creamy colored nib I would pair
that probably with pair of jeans or the
skirt and then like a pair of boots it's
just a nice light knit full winter again
very versatile I then got this um
that jacket this is the comfiest coziest
little Jack in this video I paired it
with the skirt so it looks really good
with the skirt and also jeans it looks
good with anything I really really love
this one and it's like a really pure
white I then got this pant and top I
don't know matches together it comes
with little belts it's really
sophisticated and classy and I paired it
with this amazing jacket it just looks
so classy with that and also with the
boots this jacket will come in handy in
winter so warm just classy love a nice
sophisticated cold thank you so much for
