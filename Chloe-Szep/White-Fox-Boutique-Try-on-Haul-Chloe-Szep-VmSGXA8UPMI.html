welcome back to my channel today's video
is going to be a whole from white box
boutique I also got you guys a discount
to save you some money for I'll leave
that below and it will appear on the
screens and we're here
so the first basic that I picked up was
this beige kind of knitted top
it's the comfiest top ever seriously and
it's so versatile it goes with
everything
I put it with like my black high-waisted
jeans or my black high-waisted shorts
just anything high-waisted looks really
good with it I also got one in gray
because you can't have enough of these
basic tops I seem to have no basics so I
then picked up this body suit leotard
bodysuit Liat are we dancing
I let me down this bodysuit it's very
flattering I think it goes up around
your neck like that and all sorry this
one's amazing with any sort of high
waisted I think sort of high-waisted
anyway and then picked up these amazing
dresses I'm obsessed with body con knee
length dresses I'm wearing one at the
moment this one is just like a plain
white to the knee this one is also so
pretty I'm obsessed with the color it's
like a baby pink and the cutout here
within crosses is just I just love it
these dresses like a quite expensive but
they will last forever and the resale
value is like really good as well you
can sell them for like nearly as much as
you bought before this one's also the
same brand they're open or keep they're
all from whitefox boutique this one's
really nice as well it's a little more
revealing but I absolutely love it it
goes to the knee
and it's a lovely mocha color there's
also this one that I'm wearing it just
goes up around the neck amazing because
it covers that annoying fat that hangs
out here and it's also body con through
the knee I then picked up these cute
windsor-smith heels from there as well
they just buckle up here never they cute
on I also got the coolest Sony's they're
quite wife Fox Beauty has the best array
of quite studies on their website
there's so many on there and they're all
source or nice these ones are the first
ones I got so they're just like an iPad
eye with a reflector lens like a purple
reflector lens I love these
I don't really know whether the next
hirsute me as well but that's still
pretty so I thought these cat eye wants
cat eyes are very in at the moment and
they're just in like a gold color and
then these silver ones I also got a
couple of bottles of loving 10 I
absolutely love Lovington it's so so
dark and stays on for ages so I just
really like loving 10 and I got their
applicator Memphis oh that is everything
that I got from white box boutique they
have so much on their website if you
wanna go check it out and don't forget
that there is a discount card so you can
