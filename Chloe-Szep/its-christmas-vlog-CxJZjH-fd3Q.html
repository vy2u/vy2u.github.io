couple of prison I've gotta eat for
presents at home I'm gonna start this is
what mom used to do when I was a kid she
had like a massive present box that
every talent was someone's birthday
she'd say go into the present box see
what you want to give them and they were
just tons and tons of presents in this
present box I think mom used to buy
stuff when it was on special and just
put it away until is someone's birthday
so past month is that I'm gonna start
doing it Mitch and I were like let's
just start doing that then we don't have
to worry about Christmas presents and
presents yeah no nothing I'm gonna do is
get it based because some sort of ritual
I've had my whole life is gonna burst
when you go shopping I always lacked
something to just eat or drink while I'm
walking around shopping whether it's
like a party bowl I drink my ferret's a
banana buzz
but I think I might add partying this
time so let's go
I have a brown and that's your really
weed
I tried these on but like them but and
they said it's too short I can never
find jeans that are long enough
so I'm just trying to find a foundation

taking em some testers right now and I
should be Christmas shopping

Christmas shopping all I need to do is

sorry I am going to go to the gym
because I've been so lazy
I've been a lazy girl the last thing I
can be doing is going to the gym
what do you think I should go to the gym
do you think I should go to the gym
yes hello new comer okay sir Oh Drake
senior so getting dressed for the gym
it's fully naked I had a g-string one
would show your shoelace around my bum
sure story this and how lucky our front
door like you can see our whole bedroom
through the front door we've just got
windows everywhere so I'm always like
when I wrote a naked I'm just like
 hell
caught me both at all the windows are up
and I'm just gonna lay them up and type
of thing I'll be naked to larger slides
in the front door it's just see-through
anyway heard this knock looked around I
was fully fully fully naked couldn't be
more naked than I was and the postman
was there he knocked he ran I dropped to
the floor like cuz I was so embarrassed
that I was naked tried to hide my body
he ran away I was like and he was like
across the other side of the road I keep
rain away because he's like oh my good
it just sort of naked didn't actually
say that that he saw me naked so I think
he doesn't been embarrassed but from now
on I would rather go to the post office
than see him at the door again if I see
him no chance I'm answering the door
he's just seen me put naked - no I could
really fancied that he ran off he's
probably like too embarrassed he
probably thought I had to come to the
door to get us he just was like no he
was either like hell I can't
even see that again that's God MIFA live
oh he's just doing that I can he will
deliver eight parcels a day they're
hoping it happens again you'll start
breaking apart in your little job I can
feel stop saving these things just so he
asked the ability room on the off chance
he catches you in a banger again anyway
I'm gonna pretend that didn't happen
then just go to the gym make it what are
the chances that someone comes to the
door at five o'clock in the afternoon
