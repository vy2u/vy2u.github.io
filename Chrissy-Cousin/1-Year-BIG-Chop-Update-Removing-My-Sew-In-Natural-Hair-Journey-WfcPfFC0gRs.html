so today's video is going to be my
natural dick schaap hair update so I've
been getting so many requests on to do
this video as soon as they hit August
first I was like big chop update big
chop update like I've been getting so
many snapchat requests to get this video
up and I did record my big chop on
August 1st but that wasn't my official
big chop I think about two weeks later I
went back and I completely cut all of my
hair off like it wasn't even an inch of
hair and I had a couple of inches of
hair on that big chunk video and if you
haven't seen that video already I will
have that linked in the description box
below I say that in every video but I
will have all the information and links
below and also all of my update videos
that I did do when I was going through
the process of showing you all my
journeys so I think the last update
video I did was my six month big chop
update and that was I'm not even sure
I'm not even sure anyways the timeline
will be below if you want to check it
out make sure you go click it and that
was the last time that I ever say it
saving anything about my natural hair
and that's the last time that you all
have seen my natural hair so this is
just gonna be the video of me taking
this wig out I know you all want me to
see a curl but I'm gonna do that another
time but other than that let's just get
straight into this I don't want this to
be too talkative I just want you all to
see how my hair looks and another thing
is that I had no clue how my hair looks
I've had my breathe for about I don't
know I think the first time I got braids
was in
Jewish so that was probably the last
time that I seen my actual hair like
blue doubt at all that so I'm excited
and this is my first time ever taking
out a 360 frontal or a stolen it looks a
mess because I haven't gone anywhere in
six days so it's just been under a hair
scarf just and I've been sleeping all
kinds of ways so don't mind my hair
let's just take this out and see how
these braids look under here oh my gosh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
