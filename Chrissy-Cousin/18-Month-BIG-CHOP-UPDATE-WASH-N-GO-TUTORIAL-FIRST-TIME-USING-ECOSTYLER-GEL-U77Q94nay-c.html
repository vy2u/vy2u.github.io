this is all I can I save it up here you
can really motions you can explore that
TV love it alright welcome back to my
channel so today's video is going to be
a very requested video of course so this
will be my natural hair update this is
about a year and I have through my Big
Shot journey I did big chop on my hair
August of 2016 I big chopped on camera
and then a couple days later I I think
was like September beginning of
September and I completely like shaved
off my entire hair and then from there
that was when I started my journey I
will have all the videos linked below of
the updates that I do have and you guys
can kind of see where my hair came from
and this is what we have guys I don't
really know how fast my hair supposed to
be growing I really don't care my hair
is super healthy and I have no heat
damage whatsoever in my hair is like
pretty much the same length but I want
to talk about that in this video so make
sure you keep on watching okay so I'm
just want to come to you all first and
tell you the updates of what I've been
doing to my hair and then the second
part of the video I don't know whom to
split this into two parts or just one
long video so the first update is that I
stopped using Aussie products you guys
know I vouch for Aussie Aussie moist
Aussie 71 that's literally all I used on
my hair and my extensions for some
reason my hair just wasn't reacting how
it used to react to it and just living
the moisture that I needed and I don't
know my hair didn't feel like we're
finished after using it so I think it
just stopped working ultimately on my
hair and also my extensions so that was
really weird I don't know if I just from
it but the new products that I am using
is these two products they are super
random they are not even a set and I
think I'm gonna continue to use this
until eventually hopefully it doesn't
but it fit like starts to change up on
me I'm gonna continue using those
products um another update is I haven't
started taking biotin yet no type of
hair growth pills or anything a lot of
people ask me how did I grow my hair out
like I said I'm not using hair growth
pills or anything but I do wear wigs and
I do think that that is a contribution
not even like to grow in my hair out but
to keeping it healthy but I get my hair
braided down by my grader I think that
AB Raider is very important after if she
braids my hair and moisturizing my scalp
I also go and maybe like a couple days
later and remoisturize myself with oils
I go a little mixture I put them in a
little container like that would have
been so messy so this is a little
mixture I have right here it's so strong
and it's so thick like y'all this stuff
is so thick let me show you it's like
it's okay
what is in my hair now these are the two
lawyers right here it's the Jamaican
mango and lime the Jamaican black castor
peppermint in Venice the Jamaican black
castor of the limit oil so lemongrass
I'm sorry
so the lemongrass gives it that nice
little lemony smell and then the
peppermint oil it gives a tingle on my
scalp and it feels so good I showed you
guys another hair growth I think was
called wild growth a lot of you guys
told me to use that and I did but I
don't know why I stopped using that but
those are the ones that I use on my hand
and my hair is typically braided
straight back and I'm just going with
this and go down each braid in my hair
it's just so moisturized and it just
feels like it's like you can feel it
working
so those are pretty much the only things
that I changed up with my hair um the
conditioner the shampoo and the oils I
don't think that I have any more updates
on my hair but you know where are the
wigs cuz you guys see that's what I do
if you follow me on my social media yeah
I just really want to show you guys how
I achieved this look I think that my
hair looks really it looks really
healthy it feels healthy I'm not too
sure of how long it's supposed to be at
this point I don't know if this is a
normal length if it's growing fast
this is growing slopes but honestly the
thing is that I don't care
yeah that's basically all I have to say
um before I get into the tutorial part
okay so before I get into the video I
just wanted to share this wash with you
guys I did post this watch on my
Instagram story a couple of weeks ago

am partnering up with this company I'm

this also represents a baby there
because this is baby air colors you
don't know what baby area is that is my
new hair collection coming out with us
now we're talking about right now we're
gonna get into this hair tutorial so
this is just how my hair looks once my
braids are pretty grown out she braids a
really tight really small really flat
and when I get a fresh braid down you
can literally see my scalp like this so
the fact that you cannot even see my
scalp means that my hair grow out a bit
much I'm just showing you how your
braids will look if you grow your hair
out with a wig like literally
this one the flap this one's flapping
this is how the back looks and it's
still very flat
here we go
so this is the next day the new problems
that I am using on my hair is like
Karen's daughter and Tresemme cell today
I wash my hair with the Maribel plum and
this is a saw free saw free a sulfate
free shampoo so it gives a nice little
stutters but suds yeah can I talk today
and also this is the conditioner I use
and this is the Tresemme moisture rich
and I have used this previously before I
did the big chop and I forgot how good
this conditioner is after using this
conditioner the Aussie moist has no type
of moisture compared to this like this
can probably like bring the crispiest
hair back to life like this is amazing
and it made my hair super soft and it
makes my extension salt also so this is
even what I use on my extensions so this
is just the weirdest combination but
this is what I'm using so I am gonna use
my crystal orchid the main choice of I
attend a few styling gel I don't know
why I'm not starting my hair I'm just
talking alright so I'm gonna use this
for my wash and go today this is gonna
be a first impression so they'll never
use this on my hair so yeah let's see it
is officially touching my neck
palm trees waiting for the summer
nowhere to go
okay so this is all I'm gonna do to my
hair today I don't even think I'm gonna
tie down my edges because I know they're
gonna like a mess up anyway so I'm just
gonna wait to style my edges in the
morning this is how my hair looks on the
side in the back as you guys see the
front of my hair rarely well it curls it
has like a wave
but it's not nearly as defined as the
back of my hair and the sides of my hair
that's the curliest part of my hair it's
just like this part right here I have to
do the most and finger Coolio and just
do a whole lot of stuff so I'm gonna see
how this dries now that my hair is
longer so I'll see you guys in the
morning
bye guys okay so this is the next
morning I didn't even put a bonnet on my
head because when I put a bonnet on my
curls are scrunched up so I just went to
sleep on it like that like I was careful
how I slept I kind of slept on my arm
I'm gonna try to like put a style in it
maybe like sum up some down
so yeah thank you guys so much for

questions comments or concerns let me

do another wash and go tutorial but I
