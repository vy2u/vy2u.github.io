today's video is going to be a very long
awaited natural hair big chalk update
from myself so um as you all know a
couple of months ago I did big chop my
hair so I didn't record the process also
I will have the thumbnail somewhere
right here if you all have not watched
it or if you are new to my channel on
you all can click the link below so you
all can check out that video I've got a
lot of feedback from that video some
negatives some positive mostly positive
which I really do appreciate because
that is something that I really wanted
to do for such a long time and I finally
built up the courage to actually big
chop my hair not to UM cut off split
ends or cut off heat damage
I literally just wanted to big chop my
hair from the beginning so that's what I
did and I did that on August 1st to be
exact
really did not expect that much support
and all of those comments from that
video so I'm really proud and I'm very
grateful of how well that video is doing
and how it inspired people to big chop
I've been getting so many comments and
also so much feedback on my snapchat on
my Twitter on my Instagram and people
just so many people showing me pictures
and emailing me about how that video
inspired them to big chop and I really
honestly did not expect that much from
that video so thank you all so much yeah
so just a little flashback to that video
um I did not professionally cut my hair
I did use some regular scissors that I
had at my house and a lot of people were
telling me those are not haircutting
scissors I know that but I wasn't trying
to cut a style to my head and I wasn't
trying to be precise or any of that
stuff I literally just wanted to get
those colored ends and all that breakage
off of my head so I just picked up any
type of scissors and just cut it all off
so a couple days later I was happy with
my big chop but then I wanted to cut it
shorter I literally wanted to start over
like not balls but kind of almost bald
so I ended up cutting my hair to the
root so the hair it looked like I
literally shaved my head but I just cut
them with scissors I will have a picture
of the remainder of the hair that I cut
off and that's when I posted the hair
giveaway video so the day before is when
I cut my hair and the next day I posted
my back-to-school hair giveaway I will
list a picture right here and as you can
see my hair was super short I could not
part my hair it was literally like this
diss diss short so I was happy with that
like I said I want to start completely
over I didn't want to see a curl pattern
any of that the only thing that I was
kind of able to do was comb was lay down
my baby hairs with gel and those barely
formed baby hairs but it was short how I
wanted it so as you can see now my hair
grew out a nice bit it's only been about
two and a half months since I completely
big chop so August 17th is when I
completely just cut off the hair and
August first was when I big chop wish
you are so but this is a two and a half
month update on my hair I was going to
do a one month update but nothing really
was going on so I'm not taking any
vitamins or are not putting anything
specific in my head nothing
none of these products are new except
for one of them it's the Apple g keratin
and green tea
Reconstructor Iser and I like how this
was all my hair when I was relaxing my
hair a couple years ago I liked how this
felt old my hair didn't weigh it down
and it gave it like a refreshing feel so
basically what it says is a strict ins
instantly builds body protects color and
chemical services so my hair is not
chemically treated but you know I still
would spray this on my hair because I
like it as a leave-in type of treatment
so this I like this and it cost $5.99
from my local beauty supply store so
this is just one of the things that I
randomly sprayed in my hair throughout
the week in case I wanted just a little
treatment in it but I don't use this
regularly because it like I said it is a
reconstructive riser and I don't have
any heat damage or any of those sort of
things for it to reconstruct so um yeah
nothing really specific with this but I
did spray this in my hair just for a
slight treatment but all of these other
things right here is things that I
mentioned in my previous videos so the
first thing you all know Aussie moist
conditioner I literally use this since I
shot my first video on YouTube a year
ago so this is the Aussie moist
conditioner and this is a holy girl for
me because it's just super lightweight
it moisturizes the hair super super
great and it's affordable and you get
this um big jar and also this um pump so
it's easy to pump and you know put into
your hair you have to take out a bottle
and like squeeze it when you're in the
shower but before I use this I use the
Tresemme moisture rich shampoo like I
said in my videos before so this is the
original bottle and it says Tresemme
moisture rich luxurious moisture and
this one also comes with a pump which I
like and um it's also really affordable
I think it's like 495 minute.i but if
you want to spend even less amount of
money you can use the the equate generic
version of it and this it also says on
the package it says come
here to Tresemme luxurious moisture
shampoo so this is the moisture rich
shampoo by equate and it's probably like
half the price I don't really remember
this one's empty nothing in here this
one is the fluent and this is the one
I'm using right now and this is what I
use to shampoo and condition my hair
today
so my hair is still damp I did recently
wash my hair a couple of hours ago and I
only I wash it once once and I'll don't
wash it again my hair is really not
dirty because it's under wigs all the
time
so um it's not really too much washing
to do but it's super easy and then I
just wrap that out and then I go with my
Aussie moist conditioner but the two
other conditioners that I use is the
osteotomy Racal 7 in one and I also
mentioned this in my videos before and
this one is just as good as the own
Aussie moist positioner so this is
another one that I use if I run out of
any of my other quality moist
conditioners and I ran out of this one
so I'm using another one by Aussie so
this one is the Aussie awesomely clean
conditioner and um this one has a
different smell from the other two which
I like is something different but they
all feel the stain they all do the same
thing they if you read the bank they
tell you the purpose of it but this one
is kind of like a cool cleanser and a
conditioner so it's like a two or one
kinda bit yeah so the voicing moist ah
awesome we clean in the Aussie seven and
one conditioner are the only things that
I use in my hair and this is the only
product in my hair right now like I said
I washed my hair with the Tresemme
moisture rich and then I go in with
either one of these and that's literally
all I have been doing to my hair for the
past two and a half three months so
nothing dramatic I learned early on in
my natural day
that can - cream of nature shea moisture
all the things pretty much like lay down
my hair with my curl pattern and it was
very heavy on my head so if I didn't do
anything for my curl pattern because I
am like a 3 C type texture and that's
another reason why I wanted to
completely just like cut off my hair
because I wanted to one of my hair to
grow out into the texture so I basically
wanted to see my hair grow out into its
natural texture so that was another
reason why I completely just like cut it
all but my hair is pretty much growing
out so pretty I love my little curls
this is nothing I literally wash my hair
and put conditioner on my wet hair and
let it air dry and it's still drying but
these are the curls with me not doing
anything to it not brushing any product
in it literally just condition our air
drying my hair the things that I am
planning to do with my hair so I have
been thinking about coloring it a
different color so I'm kind of pushing
towards the burgundy red Auburn type
field so that maybe even X and it's my
hair I don't want to dye it blonde or
anything because that's the reason I had
too big chop it in the first place
so yeah that's what I plan on doing
maybe in late November early December
maybe I'm still not sure you all have
any suggestions just let me know below
and I am going to start taking biotin
pills I know I've heard of sugar bear
hair pills
um Hairfinity the main choice I'm not
going to take any gold I'm just going to
take the regular biotin pills from
Walmart also it's super affordable I've
taken these when I was relaxed when I
was transitioning and they did my hair
super great so these are the Spring
Valley biotin 5000 mcg soft gel pills
and I've taken these before and they do
wonders for my hair and it's for hair
skin and nail help and their soft gels
and it comes with 240 I think was like a
narcotic from one mom it's things we're
gonna help my hair also grow out I'm
kind of sad about it gone out because I
really like how easy it is for me to
just throw on my own wigs and go and
just take it off at night so I'm not
gonna be looking forward to braiding my
hair soon again so I'm Chara
you know keep a shirt on is possible but
I want to show you all the journey of me
growing it out so that's why I'm going
to start taking bead so yeah that's the
only things that are plan on doing with
my hair from now on so I will keep track
of my progress with the growth and all
that stuff and also if I'm planning on
dying for my hair red burgundy whatever
color I will try to record that I will
try I will record that so yeah that's
basically all I have to say about my
hair
um you all have been super supportive
throughout this whole process a lot I'll
always message me on snapchat telling me
what I'm going to do this update so I'm
happy that I'm able to get this out to
you all but it's nothing major like I
said and I'm sorry this video is going
to be so long but I just want to get all
these details out if you'll have any
suggestions on what I should do to my
hair how I can keep it up then I will
share the love for it but I don't plan
on putting anything in my hair not Shea
Moisture can't do any of that for now
just cuz I know would work best for my
hair when I was transitioning and when I
was natural still would he damaged but I
will still try to try some of the things
only because this is a new journey in my
hair is like no color door is like
virgin hair now so maybe in the future I
will try out some of those things but
for now I'm just going to stick to this
until I start wearing my hair out once
again that's basically all how to say

comment and subscribe and I will see you
all in my next video
when you get straight hair or when you

does tend to get thinner at the end
