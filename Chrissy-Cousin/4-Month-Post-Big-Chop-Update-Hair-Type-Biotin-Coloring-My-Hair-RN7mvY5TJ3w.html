to be a four-month update on my big shop
so a lot of people have been asking me
to do just another update on my big shop
if you all didn't know I they chopped my
hair on August first I believe I'm
really not sure I'm gonna have all of
those dates in the description box below
from my first time cutting it all to my
second time just like basically shaving
it all so this is how I initially cut my
hair in my first big chop video and if
you haven't seen that video you can
check that out in the description box
below I will have it linked and all that
stuff so if you haven't watched it go
watch it and I'll have some pictures in
this video just to give you all just a
timeline if you haven't watched my
previous videos but if you have been you
know keeping up with me then you would
know about those previous two videos but
yeah this is basically how my hair grew
out another thing is that I'm really
just trying to get the filled my hair
again I really don't remember my texture
hair how it was when it was long and
curly if you watched my too much update
you will see that I said I will start
taking biotin pills if you don't know
what biotin feels it's a hair
enhancement skin nails you know
supplement to help you grow healthy hair
healthy nails but I didn't take bites
and I haven't started taking biotin as
you can see am I too much of the video
that my
my face kind of had some breakouts and
really didn't want to like start dealing
with that I was gonna start maybe like a
month later on my body attend just on my
face to clear up a little and I just
never started because it started to
clear me that I was like I know biotin
kind of breaks you out when you start
off just like just start taking it so
when I was taken by a tent with my long
hair it was growing amazing I was having
breakouts here and there but I was
managing it because I started off on a
low dosage but I worked my way up to
taking 210 mcg pills daily so I was
taking 20 mcg and my hair was just
growing at such a fast rate but I had to
work my way up today so if I was to
start taking biotin again I would
probably have to start off I think the
lowest is 500 mcg if I'm not mistaken or
1000 mcg and I would literally have to
start from 1,000 and working my way back
up to 20 which I really wasn't excited
about doing because I know if I just
started taking 20 mcg s just like
strafing the jump girl like my face
would have been I don't even want to
think about it like so I really didn't
want to even go through that process but
I know that's what I would have had to
do if I wanted to start taking biotin
again if I do start so you know think
about planning on taking it I will let
you all know but I don't plan on taking
it anytime soon because I don't like the
rate that my hair is growing right now
and my face is much much much clearer
than it was on that video so I don't
know I don't I don't want to mess
anything up or throw like anything on
track another thing I mentioned in my
two-month update video is like what I
was washing and conditioning my hair
with so I still am washing and
conditioning my hair what Aussie
products no I'm not have never been
sponsored by Aussie I'm pretty sure
have never even seen my videos but I am
well to get this look I did use the
Aussie seven and one miracle shampoo and
conditioner and like I said in the video
also is that is the only thing that has
been working for my hair is Aussie
products that's basically what just I've
been doing and it's not that I don't
want to experiment with new products
I literally really do want to experiment
with new products but it's just like the
experience that I had with my longer
hair trying can to try and shea moisture
treatments maxed all that stuff like it
just didn't do anything for my curls and
then again my hair was he damaged colour
damage I'm broken off so I really can't
judge those products 100% because I mean
I wasn't taking care of my hair and
maybe it was weighing down my hair
because my curls weren't as formed or
virgin curls to where it could actually
form occur with those products so I am
I'm not giving up on other products I
mean if you all have any suggestions on
what you all may think that I may like
to leave that in the comment section
below because I really do want to try
new things that I want to have child and
error with you also you all can see that
some things really may not work for me
and may work for you or other youtubers
but my hair is growing out in this
version form and it may be different now
so I'm definitely going to give those
things another shot but I know one thing
that's not working for me now
is eco styler gel before I did this to
my hair which is only Aussie 7 and 1
conditioner in my hair right now I'm
just dry and also this is second second
day here
so before I dip this to my hair I was
like okay I'm gonna give this a shot and
just you know Eco style put eco styler
and my hair
a finger coil girl that did not work
my hair was damp and I literally got
just a little eco styler I started with
a little finger coil and then I got a
lot in just finger cord or another
section and it didn't work like it
formed no type of curl it was just way
down and then it was white which would
have probably dried up because I hadn't
experienced experience with that before
but it was just dry feeling it was it
felt brittle and I just I just wasn't
feeling it so I know eco styler is not
working for me still and another thing
it's like you're trying to figure out if
you have 3/8 hair 3c hair 3b hair 4c
hair for a hair I know for the fact that
I am a 3 something so now I'm just
trying to figure out if I'm a 3a through
B or 3 C so I'm more than sure I'm a 3 B
or C I'm gonna have to look at like some
charts of some pictures and also some
like YouTube videos of 3 C hair and all
those type textures I know for sure I'm
not 4 and I know for sure I'm not a 2 or
1 another thing I have been considering
with my hair is coloring it so I have
colored my extensions the past two times
that I did reviews for companies and I
did like a reddish deep burgundy color
on both of those vendors so I was kind
of low-key considering dyeing my hair
burgundy and I don't want to get a lot
of like feedback from you all telling
you to like no don't do it this is why
you cut your hair in the first place but
I mean if I were to dye my hair with
like a door or something it would have
had to pre bleach my hair then I would
have understood but with the dye that I
do that I would plan on dying my hair
with all you need is um developer in the
color so that's not really damaging my
hair as much as bleach would and it
hasn't damaged like the curls in my in
my extensions so I don't think we will
do too much
damage to my hair if you know what I
mean another thing is that if I was to
dye my hair I will want to diet while is
short just to see like how my curls
would take it besides me you know
coloring it when it's longer and then me
just damaging all of that hard work of
growth and if you are wondering this is
the dye that I dye my bundles with
though it's magenta and the high color
highlights by L'Oreal so let me know in
the comment section below if I should do
that just let me know if y'all want to
see me do it because I will record it
and show you all the process of like how
it turns out so so I literally just go
to sleep like this that's all so this is
a ghostly and I wake up if my hair is um
kind of like messed up in the front then
I just you know do the eco styler gel
with some water in a toothbrush in I'm
good to go
also and another thing is I get a lot of
questions on what I do to my bush under
my wigs so don't worry I will have a
video on what I do to that but there
ain't no braided because I can't grip my
hair are braided so I'll show you all
what I do is basically what I did in my
how to lay a you how to lay a closure
videos basically just me doing the same
thing but I'm going to show you all a
video on how I do that separately so
yeah stay tuned for that so yeah that's
basically all I have to say in this
video if you all have any questions
comments or suggestions just let me know
in the comment section below I don't
know what you all think about my hair
which you all want to see what y'all
want me to try in my hair and let's just
keep this journey going I'm loving it so
far and I can't wait until my hair grows
well actually I can't wait but you know
we're on this journey together so much
you want to see my hair grow so yeah
that is basically all thank you all for
watching my videos and I really hope you
all are having a wonderful new year so
far
and I will see you all in my next video
