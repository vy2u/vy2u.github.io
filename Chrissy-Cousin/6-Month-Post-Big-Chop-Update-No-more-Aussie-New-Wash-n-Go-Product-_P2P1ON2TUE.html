so today's video is going to be a big
chop update a lot of you all have been
asking me to do this update on my
snapchat and I was like yeah I think
it's about time for me to come on here
and show you all what's been going on
with my hair as you can see this is the
update that has accurate since my
previous video in y'all honestly I see a
big difference I know it's not a huge
change but since my previous update in
January I do see a difference and um a
lot of things have changed with my hair
honestly and I'm going to tell you all
some of the factors that I think did
change so stay tuned so I recently
posted a picture on my snapchat um you
can follow right here if you want to and
I stated that I use another product
other than Aussie on my hair and my
freakin snapchat followers went crazy
they was like no we're gonna have to see
what this product is and I was like
don't worry guys I want to post a video
about it so this is kind of a video
update of telling you guys some new
things that I'm trying on my hair so
like I said in my previous previous
update video that nothing really works
for my hair and I said I didn't know
that was kind of because the two
different hair textures clashing but one
product that has been working for me so
far is gorilla snot and I know that you
all are familiar of gorillas not from my
lace frontal video haughtily lace
frontal with a TWA light with short hair
so the gorillas not that I'm using is
this one right here and it's not the
squeezed one that I usually use in my
lace frontal video which is this one
this one I don't know what the
difference is I feel like this one is a
little bit more juicier like a little
bit more slimy err and this one is a bit
more sticky but the reason why I decided
to use gorillas not one because my
friend
told me that this helps her hair curl
but when I tried it on with my
transitioning hair it really wasn't
doing anything for me so I was like well
that doesn't work when I was finding
products to lay my TWA teeny-weenie air
so a lot of people were asking me what
that means but that means teeny weeny
afro but I'm trying to find a product to
make my hair straight bag
I knew that gorilla snot will do the job
but as you see in that video when I was
laying my hair bag my hair was curling
so I was like my hair is curling but I'm
still laying it down so um
by the time the base for my lace front
so um by my hair being laid from this I
realized how freakin defines my curls
were and I was like yo and I really
didn't hit hit my attention to see like
my hair was actually curling with this
stuff well not right here but like in
the back where I didn't have it laid by
this I was like my hair is curly and I
super freaking - fine
and one day a couple of weeks ago I was
like this was just sitting in my head
and I was like I'm gonna I'm gonna try
this out so I'm not using any products
for washing my hair at the moment I
still am using my aussie 7 in one
shampoo and also following by the aussie
7 and one total miracle conditioner so
once i wash my hair i wash rinse wash
again runs and once my hair it's 80%
like damn i go in with this and i just
saturated with that i let that sit and
then I rinse it out a little then once I
get out of the shower I went in with
this and what I did it comes like this
it doesn't squeeze out but it comes in
like a little jar I scoop my hand in it
and I rub it all over my hands
I literally just go back and forth like
this all over my hair and like I even
like go crazy with it I'm like
I just go crazy with it just sold this
sucker saturate all my curls and get
super super on the 5 in gone it's so
freaking pretty if y'all saw my previous
dick SHOP video you saw that my curls
really weren't that defined and I was
just using this in my head I wasn't
using any other products I was just
using this and now that I use guerrilla
snot it is so freakin beautiful um this
is definitely a go for my texture for my
porosity of my hair but I really am
going to start trying things you all let
me know some things below not sure I
want me to try because I don't want to
just stick to one thing someone said um
if it ain't broke don't fix it in my
other video like saying well it's the OC
working for you just stick with the
Aussie girl like you don't need to be
using nothing else but I just want to
try out new things with you all just to
see like does it work or not
so you all come I actually see like you
know and I can see - so like first
impression videos just let me know I
want to get into those things so a lot
of my snapchat followers have been
telling me snapping me and also a lot of
people in my comments have been telling
me to get in this product right here and
this is the wild growth hair oil I have
not used this um since I bought it about
four weeks ago from Sally's and I
believe it was like $4.99 a fine and I'm
really not sure but um yeah they was
like get the WoW hair growth oil it's
gonna make your hair grow so fast and I
was like let me see what this raves
about so I just got it I haven't used it
yet I probably start in the beginning of
April just so I have a set time and I
know like when I started working for me
if it works but on the front of the
bottle
it just says first time ever thicker and
longer hair eyebrows eyelashes eyelashes
you can put this on your eyes I don't
think that's safe eyelashes and nails
instant and natural hair
retexturizing the Tingler and straighten
up with less heat blow-dry fluttering
and press relax or stretch your hair bow
to fire and fly wick troller y'all this
Abdullah African quality hair may it
next to shoulder would apply 15 to 20
drops for each of four sections of damp
towel dry hair or dry hair and comb
through hair in part then sparingly
apply to an entire scalp with pointed
spouts and it says for less or shorter
hair which would be my hair um use three
times per week after washing on damp
hair all other hair types on applied 515
Joss every container type stuff like
penises are down or towel dried hair
comb or brush through every 5 3 5
minutes until hair clean dries reduced
quantities used to avoid oil is applied
between washes only fair comes dried
okay so they just give you like the
directions for your hair length I am
very excited to start trying this it
smells like I don't know kind of like a
peppermint I don't know but um some
people say that it really doesn't work I
look at the reviews also before I bought
it some people say they didn't really
see a difference but I'm going to try
for myself just because so many people
on that watch my videos read to me about
it so I can't wait to try that that's
gonna be the next day that I try on my
hair and what else yeah that's basically
all um when I start trying this I was
going to think about join biotin pills
but I'm not going to start taking biotin
and while growth on hair oil at the same
time cuz I'm really I don't know first
I'm scared to take value to now I said I
would want to start taking it but I'm
kind of scared to take it just because
my skin has been doing pretty okay from
where it was and I don't want to start
breaking out so I'm going to think about
the biotin and get back what you all
don't need people ask me why don't you
wear your natural hair and more and it's
not that I'm ashamed
because I wouldn't be talking on camera
and I definitely wouldn't cut my hair if
I thought it was gonna be a shame but
it's just because I review hair and I
like Maui's I like my lose and it's
helping my hair grow so but the Gorillaz
not is not breaking off my hair anything
it's doing good hopefully me saturating
it in my hair doesn't break it off but
we'll see trial and error and I send my
other video big chop of day videos that
I was thinking about coloring my hair
red as you can see I didn't do that but
I don't think I'm gonna color my hair
right you physical I'm not wearing it
out so it really doesn't make any sense
for me to color my hair so not now maybe
when he gets a little longer but I
really love my hair so far now that I
know that my curls can get super defined
like this it just excites me so much you
know and it's another thing I think
while my hair wasn't as defined in my
other video I think is because my nails
were so like they were so long I know
y'all thought my nose in that video and
now I'm able to like use the my palms of
my fingertips in like massage the
conditioner I like shampoo in my head
which I really couldn't do with the
cause so that could be a factor while I
wasn't able to like finger coil my hair
yeah life is much easier since those
aren't on my hands anymore but that's
all I have to say for this video you all
