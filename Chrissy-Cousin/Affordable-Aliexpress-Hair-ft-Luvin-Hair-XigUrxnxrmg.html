so today's video is going to be yet
another hair review and um this hair is
from an L Express vendor and their name
goes by loving hair and this hair did
not initially come like this I actually
cut it up the bangs not the actual
bundles but I'm going to get into that
later they sent me four bundles and a
lace frontal and I made it into a custom
unit so I actually ended up using only
three of the bundles and the three
bundles that I used was the 24 22 and 20
and I think they sent me at 18 - but I
only use 3 bundles in the lace frontals
I've been really enjoying this hair I'm
still trying to get adjusted to having
big curly hair because I'm usually
wearing straight sleek hair or like
bombshell curls but I haven't had curly
hair in a minute but also this is the
hair dye I will have a tutorial on how I
well just a little snippet tutorial on
how I got this color because the color
that I was going for is not the color
that she see right here I wanted to have
kind of a copper burgundy but the hair
ended up taking the diet a little too
well and it got too bright for me so I
had to tone it down with a box dye and
who all will see the process of that um
this hair is pretty good the only
problem that I had with this hair after
you know experimenting with it was the
front so this hair is Malaysian and deep
wave curly but the curly frontal is much
more curlier than the actual bundles
which I don't really mind because I
could kind of finesse and make it Lynn
but it was a little bit so curly for me
compared to the bundles he's blending
now because I picked it out to make it
blend a little bit better I wasn't
planning on cutting the Front's whole
also so this right here is only the
front fold not the bundles the bundles
are all
exact same lint but for some reason when
I was plucking the front salt it had so
much freaking hair on it and once I
styled it I had it as a side part
I didn't didn't like how it looked it
didn't look as natural as my other
frontal installations or my other
frontal wigs so I ended up just making a
bang and if something different and I'm
still trying to get used to it so I
don't really know how I feel about this
look you all let me know in the comment
section below it kind of reminds me of
the picture that Rasheeda had on her
Instagram a couple of weeks ago but hers
were actually like let's I think it was
a flexing right and I'm not sure that
was the natural texture I mean everybody
was super cute that's what this kind of
reminds me of and that's what I was
aiming for when I was cutting this but
if you all are interested in seeing how
I experimented cutting this then stay to
the end of the video and also if you all
wants to see how I colored to get this
deep burgundy cherry really deep
burgundy cherry look just stay to the
end but it was a trial and error with
this unit but I'm still experimenting
with it and we'll see how I end up
liking it oh and another thing about the
front so is when I was sewing the
Front's when I realized that it didn't
have a secure bands around the back but
when I have other frontals they have
this kind of I don't know what is
published a secured around the back of
the front so so when you stoie down on
your client or the wicked it doesn't
really tear the lace in the back but
this one I had to cut the lace off the
back of the frontal and also it didn't
had that secure band on the back so the
lace is kind of ripping I was pulling
the thread through it so that's another
thing I like about the front split other
than that the hair is great and yeah I
don't want to try to get adjusted to
this look something different like I
said but other than that that's really
all I have to say in this video like I
said I will try to keep you all updated
all of this hair
anything else new I do to it but if you
all have any questions comments or
concerns make sure you let me know in
the comment section below and I want to
thank you all so much for watching so
don't forget to Like comment and
subscribe and I will see you all in my
next video bye guys okay so everything
in this video is pretty much
self-explanatory but this was just my
trial and error and this is pretty
pointless if you're not going for this
color but it's also not that pointless
because I was kind of scared to you to
bleach anyways so I'm happy that I
didn't use this because it cost so much
more less damage to my curly bundles
because you know bleach can kind of
straighten out the curl pattern so I
wasn't disappointed and what I did right
here but these two colors were so
unnecessary because I didn't end up
using them but I'm gonna show you all
what box dye core I ended up using in
the end to get the color that I had in
the first clip so yeah I just think
tuned for that but yeah I was trying to
go for a nice coppery magenta color
burnin the color but it was too bright
and you guys have seen a picture of that
was swap noxious so yeah just see how I
do the rest of the bundle
yeah this is what I'm working with right
now I'm gonna take this turban on just
so you all can see what I'm talking
about with the frontal and just because
I'm having that problem with the frontal
looking natural
and with the color I'm going to try to
chop the bang and do something different
with this I don't know what I'm gonna do
but yeah we're gonna find out right here
because I don't know I just want to see
what I've come up with and just to show
you all that I do make errors everything
is not all so perfect when I'm doing
hair so yeah we're gonna see what I can
come up with so I'm so happy that I got
this turban because I don't know what I
was gonna do I wasn't planning on
wearing this turban at first but then I
was like I can't deal with this front so
in the morning I had an early class and
it was just too early for me to be
figuring out what I'm gonna do to my
hair so this is how the hair is looking
without the tournament it's a little bit
too out for me so um I don't know I
don't know what I'm gonna do yeah I
think the thing will be so cute but I
don't know what I'm doing okay let's see
I hope I don't mess this up
ok so I'm gonna come back in the morning
and see how this looks
