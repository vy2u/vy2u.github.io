today I will be doing a tutorial on how
I get this color in my hair it's not
hard at all it's just using bleach and
it's kind of a gradient effect not
really an ombre so if you guys are
interested in seeing how I get this
simple look just keep on watching okay
so the items you will need is your
bleaching powder and you can get this
from Sally's or any beauty supply store
also a wide tooth comb a mixing bowl and
the developer depending on how bright
you want your hair I decided to use a 40
and this is a consistency that you want
your bleach to be you don't want it to
be too runny but you also don't want it
to be too thick so this is the
consistency I went for
okay so the first thing I like to do is
always comb my hair just to make sure
any tangles are out and make sure
everything is even and then we're going
to go in with the bleach and we're going
to start dyeing the tips of our hair
we're going to divide our hair into
three parts so the first third of the
hair is the tips and we're going to dye
that first because we want that to be
the lightest part of our entire hit so
I'm just want to do that on this side of
the weave and then I'm going to flip it
and just repeat that process and we're
going to do that for all the sections
and as you can see what I'm doing here
to avoid any harsh lines you can see how
I'm holding the brush and applying the
bleach I'm not applying it on a flat
surface I'm kind of just applying it on
the side and whipping the bleach down to
avoid it having harsh lines now we're
going to do is just wrap that up in some
foil and wait a couple of minutes to see
the desired color and then we're going
to repeat the process on the second
third of the hair
okay so honestly I don't even know how
long I left the hair wrapped up in the
foil I did this before so I kind of just
peek in the foil every 10 minutes just
to see if the color is how I desired it
to look but depending on how bright you
want your hair you can leave it all
longer or shorter but this is the color
that I got and then I just went and did
the second third of my hair and as you
can see I'm holding that brush again to
the side just to avoid any harsh lines
because we do not want that we want the
hair to flow into dark brown brown and
to blonde so that's why we're just
whipping the bleach on the hair like
this how I'm doing right now
you
okay then we just want to repeat that on
the other side of the hair and as you
can see I was about to put the hair in
the folio but I just decided to add more
bleach to the first third of my hair and
that's because I wanted it to be lighter
anyway so adding more really wasn't
going to do much but I just decided to
do it anyways and then we're just going
to wrap that in the foil okay so after
peaking and seeing if I got the color I
desire I took the hair out of the foil
and the tips of the hair wasn't as white
as I wanted them to be and I didn't want
the whole hair to be bright bright
bright so I just decided to wash it out
and let it air dry and just to go over
the parts that I wanted lighter again
because the brown that was at the top
the second third of the hair was the
color that I wanted and I didn't want
that to get any lighter so I just went
over the parts that I wanted brighter
and I went up about half of the bundles
because I wanted it to be dark brown
light brown and then blonde so you can
see how I went up about half of the
bundle and then once I got the desired
ombre gradient look that I want it I put
it in the foil and you guys will see how
the inner result works
okay so this was my final results as you
can see the colors are not Blunt it
flows from dark to light and this is
exactly what I wanted I hope this
tutorial helps your dyeing process to be
much easier and stay tuned for how I'll
make a you part out of this hair this is
