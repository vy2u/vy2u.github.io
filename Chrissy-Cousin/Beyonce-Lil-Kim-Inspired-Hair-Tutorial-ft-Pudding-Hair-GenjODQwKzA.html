going to be a hair inspired kind of
tutorial on the look that Beyonce did
for Halloween and her inspired look was
of course Lil Kim so this will be
inspired by Lil Kim and Beyonce so I
just wanted to do that little half up
half down look I thought it was so cute
and it's so rare that Beyonce wears
black hair so this hair really reminded
me of Beyonce
well like highlight installed it so I
installed the hair last night this is a
lace unit that I constructed and this is
also a 360 lace front so I will have all
the information for this unit right here
if you're interested in knowing what I
have in my hair right now so this is a
360 lace frontal and I made the wig
perfect like I was so happy on how I
made this unit and the back is not so
down I do have a clip a slide and comb
that is just holding it down I don't
find I'm wearing it in a ponytail but I
still one experiment what they just see
how it looks so yeah I'm super excited
and I'm just gonna like freestyle this
cuz I didn't practice the style yet like
I literally just went to sleep on my
head so I'm gonna take off my bonnet and
let's get right into it so this is the
hair right yeah um I was trying to do
like the little white button-up shirt
like yeah see did in on her picture um
in the pictures she had she didn't have
like any baby Hannah's right here
anything I did pre die didn't pluck this
from soul my soul it wasn't it plucked
when I got it
but I didn't pluck it and I think it
looks really good um it's not too many
baby hairs but she did have look like
 just to maybe here is right there
i'ma show you guys a picture and I'm
just gonna try to do it as close to her
this fossil so let's see I need a
scrunchie looks like just some loose
waves or curls in her head so I'm gonna
do the exact same thing this is gonna be
super quick I just wanted to show you
guys when I was doing
I shouldn't be hard at all I'm gonna
take all of the front so maybe some
tracks make sure the tracks aren't
showing and see I gotta do it right okay
and I have this little energy this is
how it looks in the bag hopefully no
tracks are showing
so now I'm gonna believe baby here's I'm
going to use my little wispy brush
that's
and I put a little eco styler gel
I feel like I don't have to put any
curls in this hair but I'm gonna put
just a few just to define it just a
little bit more but I think it looks
pretty good when we do these side baby
okay so now I'm gonna use my con here
what's the name of this um I'll have the
name right here because I had this for
so long I use this on my first one on
curling tutorial on here so if you want
to see that video check it out I'm gonna
use it this is on 360 degrees and I'm
just gonna put some just festive long
curls in because her here wasn't really
defined in that picture well they're
here
yeah really just messy why
and this was bodyweight hair so the
curls look really good without me having
a flat iron on plus we don't want the
hair to be going straight
okay so this is the final result of my
hair I really think this is so cute I've
never done anything like this with my
lace frontals I usually just do side
parts and middle parts but this is very
different and very off the box for me so
I look really different now but I think
that I did a pretty good job you know
interpreting both of those girls looks
little compat more of a wave and you
have to get more of the curls curl
don't try to incorporate both of their
touches in there both shout out to you
girls so yeah this is the finished
result and I really hope you guys
