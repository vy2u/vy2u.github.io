this is part three of my one-year post
big chop update if you haven't checked
out part 1 and part 2
make sure you go check those out before
you watch this video because it's
leading up to this video so I will have
those links below but if you watch those
already
welcome back and this is just gonna be
the kind of question and answer segment
of everything you all wanted to know
leading up to my one-year post a big
chop so I asked you all on snapchat in
my Instagram to send me some questions
to my Twitter I snapshot at all of the
questions and also I kind of remember a
lot of the question that you all asked
me during my journey so first question
I'm going to answer is what has been
your routine for your hair and do you
get it tramp or do you trim it yourself
and how often um
I generally wear wigs and that's pretty
much what my channel is about his wigs
and like hands and hair extensions and
that's really what I've been going to my
hair but when I was wearing my wigs you
also saw in a couple of my installation
videos that I did use gorillas not too
slicked down my natural hair which I
kind of regret because it was pretty I
don't want to say damaging but it was
really drying to my hair and once my
hair was long enough to you know Brady I
took advantage a day and I went go get
my hair braided and I was so surprised
of how my hair I was groupable but once
I got my hair braided I never went back
to that gorilla snot because that's just
so unhealthy just lathering that all on
my hair but it works I'm not gonna lie
it works if you have a TWA and you need
your hair slicked down but make sure you
are deep conditioning your hair every
time you wash that out and have to do it
again so that's what I did I was pretty
much in my routine I wasn't following a
strict
while doing my protective styling I
would just wash my hair whenever I had
the girlís knot and then when I got my
hair braided I would just wash it the
next time I was getting ready with which
would be about a month a month and a
half later that was my routine nothing
special so do I get my hair trimmed no I
have haven't trimmed my hair since my
official big shot in August of last year
I do know that I'd need to get a trim
just to keep the health up but I don't
feel like I need to but I definitely
will be doing that the next question was
I'm curious on what your growth regimen
was that can you cut your hair to the
roof did you protect your bald head or
select your wigs on there also how often
do you wash in deep condition like I
said I don't have a regimen of washing
and conditioning my hair and also um I
didn't protect my bald head when I did
cutting my hair all the way down I
literally just slab my ways on it wasn't
really much to do to it and I didn't
even wear a wig cap which I should have
probably did but I didn't so did I take
hair growth pills and no I did it I did
purchase two bottles of the main choice
vitamins which I wanted to start taking
but I didn't I just wanted to go this
one year without really doing anything
special to my hair I think that I will
start taking by you to know that I have
reached that year mark and we'll just
see how long my hair goes with that I
think it was my two-month post picture
and I did say that I wanted to start
taking bites in but I never started
because I was afraid of just breaking
out and just bumps because I did
struggle with like kind of breakouts
from stress and all that type of stuff
yeah I think I'm gonna start taking
those pills and also just drinking a lot
of water with it to avoid those type of
breakouts do I plan on dying right here
I wanted to dye my hair but actually
I think I'm not gonna do that anytime
soon dyeing your hair especially natural
hair is literally like another job
I don't know color just takes a lot of
maintenance and I really don't think
that I'm ready for that I just want to
let my hair grow and it's a virgin
natural texture that's why I cut it off
in the first place so I did not think
that I'll be doing that anytime soon did
I text her eyes my hair no I did not
texturize my hair all the big chop
updates that I did it was my natural
hair with products so it wasn't any type
of texturizer and I wouldn't plan on
sexualizing my hair my hair is already
kind of loose in the curl um section so
I don't think that I would have to
texturize my hair and I don't think it
will do much more but straighten out my
texture more you know so just to put
this out there but I see in my hair
texture this is pretty much how my hair
was before I started messing it up with
colors and Flatiron it every day when I
had leave out but my bottom curl pattern
has always been tighter than my top and
I'm not really sure about what my curl
pattern is I always said that it was
like a3 c3 Brucie - kind of because I
don't know my curls or very oily but
they are not as defined you know and
also at the top my curls are much much
much looser than my bottom ones and
these curls on the side are also very
tight like my bottom but when it gets up
here like all in this area it's like
wavy so I definitely have to finger call
you my hair to get it to kind of be
similar to this right here but this is
not what flexi rods are per mother any
that I just vehicle or my hair and it
just air dried so I did use this product
for it a little bit this is the wild
goat hair oil by hair groom fuzz calm
and I got this from Sally's I'm not
really sure how much it was but a lot of
people recommended this in my
I think four months big truck update six
months that may told me that this will
make my hair grow a lot so I did put
this on my hair before I slicked down my
hair with the Gorillaz not for my wigs
and this stuff actually works pretty
good it made my hair it's really badly
so that's why I stopped using it and I
used it for about a week when I was
wearing my wigs that I just stopped just
because it was a really strong smell
first of all and then I just had my I
was making my hair at inch but asked for
shampoo and conditioner like I stated I
only use the Aussie products but in my
previous video I did pick up two
products and these were the two products
right here this was the black vanilla
moisture and shine sulfate free shampoo
and explore dry adult and brittle hair
it says replenishes moisture improves
the manageability and as shine and has a
low sweet clover and rose and then I
also got the matching black vanilla
moisture and shine hydrating conditioner
and it says this is for dry and dog
brittle hair and it has shade biotin and
Pro vitamin b5 in it so these were the
matching ones I got from Walmart they
were pretty on the expensive side I
wasn't the price of Aussie coz also you
get like double this for five dollars
and I think these are about ten dollars
each
that's what I use to wash and condition
this and I really like these I really
like the sulfate free shampoo it didn't
make my hair over drying and the
conditioner it smells really good but I
think that's what caused my hair to have
these little white flakes in it so I
feel like that's basically all I have to
update you all with at this point if
anything new comes up I will be letting
you all know what's going on and I'm not
gonna be waiting months to update you
all anymore I know that was like torture
for some people who were interested in
my hair journey and wasn't as much
interested in my weaving experiences and
wig you know what I mean so I want to
start doing more
national hair talks and you know
experiences on here so generally please
please please let me know below which
you are wants to see done to my hair I
know you are it's for the washing go and
that's what I gave you and just let me
know any suggestions that you all you
