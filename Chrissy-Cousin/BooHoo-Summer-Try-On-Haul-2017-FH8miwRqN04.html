of Voodoo clothes so how amazing is that
and it won't hurt to enter so now that
that is all out the way let's get
straight into these clothes so the first
piece of clothing that absolutely fell
in love with was the shirt and this is
the pirate tiered sleeve high neck
blouse in the color amber and this is in
a size us fix and
this little mustard colored shirt and
though think that brought me to the
shirt was the sleeves and these are so
freaking different I have nothing like
this in my wardrobe so I wanted to try
something different and this is my
favorite piece out of all the things
that I picked out just because it's just
very bold color and it's so
sophisticated so this was the first
piece the next shirt is this one and
this one is called bar that's something
I kind of lost the tag but I will have
them all linked in the description box
below in the order that I'm naming them
and trying them on but it's just this
little striped shirt my wardrobe is
really simple basic and like easy to
throw on so this was something that I
probably already have in my closet but
this caught my attention because on the
model it came off her shoulders and I
think that's so cute and simple the next
shirt is this one right here and the
thing that drew me to this shirt was the
arms and this one looks super cute on to
is just a little bit tight make sure you
have somebody that can button the bag
for you because I couldn't even button
it but the material is just very
high-quality it doesn't feel paper how I
thought it was but this is the Heidi
jink my sleeve blouse in the color black
and this is a US size six also and I
really like how these arms look this
will look cute which is a pair of jeans
a pair of jean shorts maybe even some
black pants if you want to dress it up
but I'm very casual so I can just see me
wearing this with jeans or jeans shorts
so the next shirt that I got is the Katy
within cold shoulder top in the color
ivory and this is in a u.s. six and I
really love this one
like I said I am very simple so this is
just in a throw on shirt but I just love
how the open shoulder places just gives
it that little sophistic
but still casual look you know so this
was really cute and simple and this
would just look cute would also like
some jean shorts or something so I think
this is the last shirt that I got and
this shirt is called the greased
exaggerated tear sleeve the back top in
the color red and once again the thing
that drew me to the share it was these
arms and when I tried this shirt on I
wasn't expecting it to look that
dramatic but it did and all I know is
that you just need to have some plain
pants on with this because this shirt
does the most on its own as you can see
but it looks super cute on the model and
that's basically why I got it also it's
fit well but the arms were even larger
than I expected so yeah that's how that
looks so I did get a lot of pants and
shorts and already shorts and a skirt so
the first pair of shorts that I got were
these and I don't even own a pair of
black shorts so these are called the
Jeana high-rise the stress side mom's
short and this isn't a US size 6 and I
love how these fit they're super
comfortable I know I had an experience
with boohoo jeans before but not really
shorts and these are my first pair of
shorts from boohoo so I was really
pleased with how these fit and the
quality of them they weren't too tight
and they weren't too short and it also
weren't tools they fit perfectly so the
next pair of shorts are kind of similar
to those but these are the latter
distressed hi-rise mom shorts and the
color blue and this is a US size 8 and
I'm not sure why I got a size 8 in these
but they fit and I really like how these
look on they come a little bit longer
than those which I like because I am
five nine and a half I don't think I'm
510 yet but I am the last time I checked
that was 5-9 ahead
and for tall girls you know you don't
want us to be coming up here but so this
was definitely a plus for me and they
look really nice this is the idea
embroidered detail let it look miniskirt
in the color black and this is the US
size four so I wanted this to fit a
little bit more form-fitting and tight
because a little weird if it was loose
just because it is like faux leather but
I like the detail on this bird and it's
very simple Carrie would like some
exaggerated Hill though the fourth pair
of shorts they are called the N a ruffle
pocket tailors shorts in the color to
red and these are also in a size us fix
and either just how they like I like how
these look even like what this color
shirt it looks fine I love the little
detail ruffled pockets and it's just a
simple simple simple
short and I would wear this will
probably be like a white shirt some red
lipstick maybe a new lip like this so
awesome tans I was really really happy
with the pants that I picked out and the
first pair that I got was just these
simple simple basic mustard pants
they're called the Bria side-split
Jersey her greens in the color mustard
and this was on a US size 8 and I only
got a size 8 just because I like how
these pants like with the cuffs at the
bottom to fit a little bit more looser I
just like that bohemian look to it but
they either look super cute with some
sandals and they're just really simple
and basic like I said because my
wardrobe is pretty basic by itself so
these are just so cute to throw on with
just a simple shirt and go out the door
the next pair of pants that I got were
these and I was super happy with this
pick up just because they fit me you
know what I mean so I saw this on boohoo
tall sex
and this is a US size six and this is
the tall Eva skinny creep two pocket
trousers in the color stone these fit
amazing and I tried them on what he
knows and they look so freaking cute and
also I like the material is not thick
thick thick but it's also not like
see-through these are the top and the
white way pleat front trousers and this
was in the color Y and y'all these these
are for like that extra tall girls so
this is gonna us thighs for I probably
could have had a lingual - sighs - yeah
I probably could have got away with
sighs - the like I said it is a trouser
so it was meant to fit a little bit more
boost but y'all as you can see like in
the clip I'm going to insert the pants
are SuperDuper long white even when I
had on Hills I was on my tippy toes they
were still under my feet touching the
ground so I'm not sure how I'm supposed
to hem these or what I'm supposed to do
and also by them being high-waisted I
don't know what to do with these but I
love them and I'm so happy that boo boo
caters to tall girls because I was
looking at the Rings you for these to
figure out what size I was gonna get
because honestly I thought they were
gonna be too small and too short so I
looked at the reviews that they had and
they had 4 5 stars form but the girls
were like these are entirely too long
and they were like saying they're high
eight one girl was like I'm 6 1 or
something and they were too long on her
so I was like what I would like she has
to be exaggerating because they can mean
that well I never met like I never saw
something be too long for a tall girl so
I was like bein that long and then I was
like being that low when I got so I
don't know if y'all have like any
suggestions can I help
it's like this I'm not sure I don't know
we'll see but I really want to wear them
so I'm gonna find out what to do with my
favorite pant that I picked up yeah
these are my favorite pant because
they're so freakin classy and
sophisticated and also I don't own
anything like this and my wardrobe and I
just love this material because it's
super Airy but this is the corona multi
stripe wide leg trousers in the color
Navy and this is the u.s. size six and I
really like how these looked on a model
they're supposed to come a little bit
higher so I'm supposed to have like that
high water look but they're also high
waisted so they look really good and it
fits around my waist and around my butt
area really good and I don't know I just
love this color it's super summery and
fresh and I just love this it's just so
cute like how classy is this but you
have to be mindful but your undergarment
just because it is kind of see-through
but yeah other than that these were so
so cute I love this so much
so this is the Lola game hem tie front
play suit in the color black and this is
in the size u.s. six so this is the
front and it's like a little bra and
they're like a little high waisted short
and it looks really cute on by me being
tall though if they come just a little
bit high in the buttocks area but most
likely I'll wear like a white long
blazer that'll cover my butt so yeah I
like how this look is something
different and I don't own anything like
this in my wardrobe and last but not
least this was another item that I
really really liked and this is too tall
to ice up with in jumpsuit and the color
grade and this is in a US size six but I
really like this deep deep easy cut is
super cute and also the little guilts
and the pocket and I love how it came
firm enough down to my ankles for me to
like wear any type of flat or any
type of hail with it I really like how
this fit and looked on me and I also
tried it on with Hills and I really
really loved it so that's basically
