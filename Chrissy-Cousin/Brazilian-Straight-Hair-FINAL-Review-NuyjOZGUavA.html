channel so today's video is going to be
my update final I don't know if I would
call this a final review um I think this
is gonna be my father so this is going
to be my final review on this Ellie
grace hair that I have been loving so
far and you all have been love it also
because you guys tell me so many times
on my snapchat if you are not following
all my snapchat follow me at Chrissy cuz
because we get it poppin on snapchat
because I talk to y'all literally every
day like every day but back to the hair
this is two bundles in a front home this
is their brazilian straight texture in
the inches 24 26 and a 20 inch front oh
originally they did send me four bundles
but I ended up just using two because I
wanted to finally have like that sleep
bone straight look so I just went with
two bundles and it looks amazing
and y'all look at these curls with two
bundles in a frontal like imagine how I
would have looked with four bundles like
I can't even I can't even think about it
would have been so huge honestly the
only reason I'm taking out this hair
today is because it's just so much like
it's so long and I'm just over the long
hair for right now maybe in a couple of
weeks I'm gonna be switching back so
super long hair but as for now I'm over
it
so I'm just the specs on this hair like
I said it was Brazilian straight two
bundles in a frontal I've had
Herot installed in my head since
December 25th
so Christmas Day and I debuted on my
snapchat on December 26 which is my
birthday and I fell in love with this
hair ever since
especially the bone straight um look so
what I did was I initially washed it and
then let it air dry and just went in
with a flat iron and it was super bone
straight sleep like that was the most
bone straight hair has ever gotten on me
and aliexpress hair you kind of kind of
iffy would your textures because you
want straight hair to be straight I know
I've had some straight hair on my
channel that hasn't gotten Bulma bone
straight but this hair got bone straight
it was very sleek straight off the
package and then I wash his hair it has
to be about three four times and every
time after that it got back bone
straight and I absolutely loved it it
took the color amazing this is the color
after Washington about four times and
it's literally still there this is the
l'oreal high color highlights i use two
boxes for um the two bundles and frontal
if you all want to see how I achieve
this look definitely check out my
previous video on this hair but if you
all want to see how I got this color
house I my frontal and all that stuff
check that video out if you haven't
already but I know you guys are
wondering does this hair shed does it
tingle does it met a spur shedding and
tangling so when I had this hair bone
straight
I had no tangles whatsoever but when I
put these curls in I put these curls in
last night I got this look from just
using a wand curler I did the wand curls
and I brushed it out with my AC V brush
and I combed out all those Wong curls
and I randomly just put some place rise
in it and this is the curls combed out I
left the flecks of resin for about seven
hours and then I took them out at eight
o'clock this morning and
it is 4:07 right now so these are like
eight hour curls and I think they look
amazing and this is just how much hair
came out since I curled it last night
see like what the curls my hand kind of
doesn't go through it and one of the
things that the hair is super super long
26 inches and um I didn't put any
product in this hair or anything so it
really shouldn't have any problems
tangling but as formatting no it doesn't
met of course hair gets a little tangled
in the back also just because your neck
sweats and it may kind of get caught on
there and then dry up so it's kind of
like sweat it aside in that I don't want
this video to be too long I would
recommend this hair especially if you're
going to plan on keeping it in the
straight texture it does curl it does
hold a curl but if you want sleep
straight super bone straight hair I
would definitely recommend this hair and
also for the price of for the hair and
the frontal I think that it's a really
good deal so if you all want some good
straight hair that takes a color wheel
because that's another thing I didn't
think this hair is going to take color
that will but it did and yeah I enjoyed
this hair but on to the next thing and I
didn't forget about the virgle hair my
sister is currently wearing that hair so
I will update you all on bed and she
will show you all you know how she feels
about the hair so for how I live my lace
frontals this is what works for my hair
um if you have longer natural hair or
relaxed hair with relaxation we have a
problem you should lay flat anyways but
with longer natural hair you want to do
your braids super super small and
straight back so this is a method that
works for my TWA and also if you may
have shortened at your hair this may
work for you also but as for other long
natural hairstyles then um I really
don't have an experience with how to
have a flat lace front
but I'm sure there's videos all over
YouTube on it but yeah this is what
works for me but yeah that's basically
all have a say in this video I'm sorry
if it's kind of long I just wanted to
get all these details out for you all so
yeah thank you all so much for watching
this video don't forget to Like comment
and subscribe and I'll see you all in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
