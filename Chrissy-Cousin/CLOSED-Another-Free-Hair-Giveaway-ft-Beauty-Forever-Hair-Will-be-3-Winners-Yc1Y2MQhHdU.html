today's video is not a hair of you and
it has nothing to do with me actually
this is all for you all so today's video
will be a hair giveaway and this is
super random is no reason that I'm doing
a hair giveaway but before I get into
this video I just want to give a huge
shout out and a big THANK YOU to Beauty
forever for sending over these bundles
for you all they do not have to do this
but Beauty Forever is super sweet and
they sent me over nine bundles and three
closures so I'm super excited to give
you all all of the details on this
beautiful hair because I unpackaged it
just to see how it looks just to make
sure it looks good for y'all but I'm
gonna show you all of the hair give you
all all the details for the giveaway so
make sure you stay tuned
okay so straight into this hair um the
rules are super simple and before I get
into it I just want to say that I didn't
review Beauty forevers hair on my
channel a couple of months ago if you
haven't checked out that video make sure
you click the link in the description
box below the hair looks amazing but if
you want to see it in action make sure
you head on over to that video and just
PSA this right here is not Beauty
forevers hair so I don't want you all to
get confused or anything I will be doing
a review on this hair but I only had it
in for a couple of days so I can't
really give you all the deets and all of
that stuff and I will be reviewing more
beauty for Evers hair so make sure you
hit that subscribe button so you can see
that when it comes out and also be sure
that you hit that notification bell just
so that you can know whatever I upload
another video because YouTube is kind of
crazy and sometimes it doesn't notify
people when I upload so make sure you go
and hit that notification button but
right into this hair from these are all
the bundles right here as they don't
want to take them out of the package but
I did want to make sure that hair it was
up to par but it is and these are all of
them so like I said the rules are super
simple all you have to do is follow
Beauty for every hair on their YouTube
channel so make sure you subscribe to
them so you know when they put up new
videos and anyway
Meishan I have for you all also make
sure you follow the Instagram page
at beauty underscore forever hair and
then make sure you like their Facebook
page at beauty underscore forever hair
and lastly all you have to do is pick
from one of the six options in the
description box below and just simply
pick which one is your favorite hair
style and leave that in the comment
section below with your email so in case
you are the winner we have something to
contact you all and let you know that
you want your prize so like I said that
there will be three winners the first
winner will win 18 inches free bonus
with 18 inch and a 16 inch lace closure
of their curly hair and this is how it
looks right here I also put in a more
in-depth clip of how the hair looks up
close the second winner will be winning
3 bundles of 16 inch body waves and a 15
inch body wave at least closure through
their super soft y'all my gosh you're so
pretty and the third winner will be
winning 14 inches and a 12 inch lace
closure of their straight hair and this
is how it looks as super pretty is super
soft like I said I did try this texture
of the hair already and this curl
pattern is going no trusted make sure
you head over to that video to see how
it looks wash and styled and all of that
stuff but I've never seen their body
waves or straight hair so I'm glad that
I get to run my fingers through it but
those are the three prizes there will be
three winners so there's a more likely
chance of you all winning so I
definitely think you all should enter
there's nothing to lose um instead you
might win some free bundles so yeah
that's basically all I have to say for
this video if you need any cleaner
on the rules make sure you check out the
description box below and you all don't
even have to follow me but if you want
to make sure you subscribe to my youtube
channel and to me well hopefully you're
already subscribed but make sure um you
subscribe to my youtube channel and also
if you want to you can follow my social
media pages right here but yeah that's
basically all I have to say for this
video the rules are super simple to make
sure you check all of those out in the
description box below and make sure you
insert your favorite hairstyle out of
the six options and your email address
so I can't wait to see who wins and I'm
super excited for you all so yeah thank
