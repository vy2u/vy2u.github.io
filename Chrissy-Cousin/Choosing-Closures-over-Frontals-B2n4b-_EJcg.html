because they're gone and they're so cute
but once again I want to thank you
George for helping me sponsor this video
and I can't wait to keep wearing this
watch because it's just beautiful
but now into this hair that you all have
been asking me about one of my snapchat
this hair is from a company cotton are
not hair I will have all of their
information down below so you can click
on the link to get the hair the closure
not a frontal bit of closure so make
sure you check out that information
below I believe this was I think I
received 224 of 22 and a 20 inch bundles
and then I received an 18 inch or 15
inch closure so first of all let's just
get into the fact that this is not a
frontal and I don't even think that I
want to do frontals anymore like I don't
because this closure is giving me the
ultimate life right now like it's I
don't know a lot of let me just give
into this a lot of people exiting so
frontals or closures and all I really
kind of got adjusted to was frontals but
they say for their first weight what I
should just a closure or frontal
indefinitely from now on I must say like
closure closures are so much easy to
manage and it's just like I'll wake up
and throw
something like you don't have to worry
about baby hairs if you want to leave
hair out like you can of course my hair
is separated all back but if you want it
to leave hair out on your edges you
can't and it still want to look natural
but you don't have to just worry about
the maintenance of front tools like
front so they're just too much but I'm
used to it you know what I mean
but this closure is this hair is bombed
straight straight from that and I did
pluck my closure and I also did like
pluck the hair line of my closure so
that's why it looks like a front so
that's why y'all thought y'all thought
this was a frontal and I also put some
curls in here y'all have been asking me
to show you all how I achieve this look
and I will be showing y'all a little
demo of how I got this look but I have
like fifty thousand videos on my channel
of me curling and flexi riding hair and
I'm not quite sure why you guys aren't
tired of seeing me do that but if you
want to see it again then why not like
the other hair that I review it was
super shiny but I still liked it because
it was straight hair but by me having
curl but I don't want super shiny curls
in my hair
so this lustre was really nice and I
like how it was able to hold the curl
and I did recall this hair last night so
it is holding on pretty well to the curl
and um like I said I did pluck the
closure I did bleach the knots on the
closure and I did cut a layers in this
hair so if you're planning on getting on
this hair it's not going to look like
this if you don't cut layers in it so
that's what I did and I didn't record
how I did that so forgive me I used all
four bundles I wish the hair was just a
little bit more thicker just so it's a
little more fuller but maybe because it
is a closure that's why I doesn't want
as full as a frontal yeah I really love
this hair is really amazing and I really
am not having any problems with it so
far as for it's shedding
according to my brush maybe because the
curls but I
really tight this is what I got for the
shedding I don't know if y'all can see
that but this is what I got from is
shedding and s for tangling this hair
doesn't tangle so I don't even have that
problem but if you all want to see how I
secured this hairstyle then just watch
the end of this video if not then you
click click all girl cuz you already
know how I feel about this hair yeah I'm
just really feeling as close your I
don't know if it's the hair or if it's
simply just the closure to where I don't
even have to manage that front so I
could literally just like lift this up
look at this
Hey look at that guys but yeah that's
basically all I have to say food video I
don't want to run both too much which I
already think I did but you all love me
anyways so I know you all don't mind I
want to thank you all so much for
watching this video if you all have any
questions comments or concerns just
leave it below and I'll try to answer as
many of them as I can

you
can't believe I lost my cute bonnet oh
okay so I think I'm gonna use this side
so this is the glow by day by night all
you guys have been asking me about
whether I hit this bonnet I'll have it
links below because I don't think I had
it linked to my natural hair video so
this is it and you could just wear an
even color then I'm just gonna put this
on my head I'm not going to worry about
just occur in my edges because I don't
have any outs and also I don't have to
lay any baby hairs because I don't have
any baby hairs out either except for
right there and I can just comb that in
the morning but that's how we're gonna
do that and about the take off this
makeup and go to sleep so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
