channel so today's video is going to be
a super easy and effortless way to get
defined um curls on curly deep curly
deep curly kinky hair so this is an
Aliexpress vendor that I recently
reviewed on my channel and when I posted
this video it's funny but um when I
posted that video um some of my viewers
were like you know we aren't like that
and I was flying over so um I decided to
film this video the next day and I came
up with this look and I must agree with
some of my dears that I do like how this
looks much better and what the finger
closed in my last video all I did was do
the same thing instead I went up much
higher towards the weft finger coiling
them so in this tutorial I didn't go
that high so the finger coils are really
towards the end of the hair and not like
up here so they are down here and not up
here so it looks less like a mop or lock
so um yeah I will open take everyone's
opinions and honestly that's what
YouTube is for so um yeah I really hope
you all enjoyed this video blog any
questions comments or concerns you can
on the comment section below and I will
see you all okay so the two clips you
see right here is the hair washed
conditioned and 100% air dry so this is
the natural texture of the hair it was
more defined and like clumps together
coming straight out the package but if
you want the hair washed and conditioned
this is the result you're going to get
if you don't define these curls so I
really wasn't feeling that look
obviously so I just went on and kind of
defined those curls just to make it a
little more attained as you can see
because it's not tamed right here so um
the few materials that you will need is
water conditioner and just some gel to
slick down your baby hairs if you have
them and a Denman brush a wide toothed
comb and just a small rat tail comb just
to define your part so the first thing I
do is just spray my hair completely just
wetting it back up to show you all how
it gets wet and then you're going to go
in with your conditioner and it's super
easy it's self explanatory I'm really
not going to try to talk this entire
video so I'm just going to let you all
watch what I'm doing right now and just
see how to get this look
you
and one thing I wanted to point out is
that you can definitely just stop at
this step right here which is me just
sliding the diamond brush through the
hair so with the combination of the
water and conditioner itself and sliding
your diamond brush throughout the hair
it's defining the curls already as you
can see so you can definitely skip this
step which is just going back in
defining the hair more with finger coils
I know a lot of people don't really like
the curls at the bottom of the hair so
you can stop at the step with the
diamond brush and just keep your curls
defined like that but this one is
totally optional
you
you
you
you
so as more hours passed the hair got
dryer in of course with it becoming more
dry the bigger it becomes so um that
also goes for as the days passed the
hair became more bigger and wilder and
it got more beautiful as the days passed
I actually loved it by the third and
fourth day and then maybe by the fourth
today you want to just repeat the
process just so nothing gets tangled or
anything so this was I think this was
third in here I recorded I skipped the
day today I recorded the third day here
so yeah it lasts about three or four
days and then just repeat the process
but I love this style I really hope you
all enjoyed this tutorial and learn so
much thank y'all so much for watching
don't forget to Like comment and
subscribe and I'll see you all in my
next video bye so um I also find that
this fit in this person it fits
perfectly but it is my wallet
do I always drop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
