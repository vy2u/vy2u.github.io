Robbie with the ass try to rob me with
no tags diamond braces look mad now just
like me I'm your dad I'm big guns I
won't back down getting money I must
pass out got a robbery with the ass huh
hey nose and welcome back to my channel
so today to do is going to be another
hair initial review so this is some new
hair in my head and this hair is from a
Virgo grace hair from Aliexpress that's
what the email said but I'm going to
make sure that I have the correct name
in this video but I'm sorry if I'm far
away from the camera also I just want
you all to see like the full length and
all that stuff with the hair so I'm kind
of going to start doing my hair reviews
back here just so you all can see like
the limp in the curls and all that stuff
instead of me being super close like a
makeup tutorial and they sent me 20 22
24 24 and also an 18 inch lace frontal
and surprisingly I only used about two
bundles and then about 75% of that third
bundle so I didn't even use the fourth
bundle so that was super surprising to
me but the frontal did kind of take up
that space that I would have used with
that um fourth bundle so it was more
than enough hair just to talk more about
the hair I am feeling a little better
with my throat so I am able to talk to
you all more body hair because yesterday
I could not even get on camera and
talked as much about a hair review so
I'm going to feel it a little better I'm
just going to come and talk to you all
about it but um this is 20 22 24 24 and
18 inch lace frontal um the bundle that
I didn't use is one of the twenty fours
just in case you all were wondering oh
this is the lace frontal and I am
actually really liking this hair so far
really no complaints so far I only had
the hair in for about two days to be
exact so I really can't say too much
about it right now but so far I do love
it
and as you can see this is a different
color it is a very subtle burgundy not
near as intense as my red hair before
that hair was like fire great when I
fire it was it was a nice little magenta
red but I like this one much better it's
more of like um for the cooler you know
I like this for the cooler weather like
fall winter so it's not as intense but I
do like this subtle burgundy so I'm
filling this right now but it was super
easy to dye this hair and I really do
like how the hair took the dye and
another thing I want to say is that I
know last time I dyed my bundles it was
dyed with bleach so for this here I did
not use bleach at all which I was super
excited about because I really do not
want to go through that process of using
that ad or prints and like getting a red
mess everywhere so I did another
technique that I used to do a couple
years back on my other hair and I did go
back and use the L'Oreal hi color
highlights and also their true red box
die in oh my gosh I'm so happy how this
hair came out and I'm pleased with
actually how this year took the dye I
don't really know all the in depths of
how many parts that I used but I will
have that in the video I think it was
about three no more than three for sure
but yeah two boxes and arranged for
about $7 a box but really wasn't that
bad and one box kind of handled at least
a bundle and a half so it was worth the
price I think and I didn't have to deal
with the bleaching process and having
that hair air-dry and then going back in
using that messy adored eye
I mean rinse so you know it was a plus
but um I did kind of have trial and
error with this color so you all will
kind of see what I'm talking about but
i'ma let y'all see what I mean in the
video and don't worry you all I do have
you all
on how I got this color so make sure you
stay tuned for the end of this video I
will have other toriel on how I achieve
this color on my bundles so and this is
also flexi rod curls but the curls are
just um two days old so they kind of
fail but I like how it came out without
me having to reapply those flexi rods so
I'm happy that this hair is holding that
curl from over 30 hours so that's a plus
so far but I will be keeping you all um
updated on this hair of course but I'm
excited to keep trying this out in like
I said I am loving this color and one
thing I love about this hair before I
get into that tutorial is this front so
so y'all this fragile it was just
flawless yeah this frontal came pre
plucked but I didn't really have to do
much plug into it but of course I went
in and added baby hairs and all that
stuff so that was the only thing that I
really had to do this frontal and also
reach the mask because it didn't come
leech but all idea was bleached the
knots on this frontal and also added
some baby hair then kind of pluck this
some more just so the hairline could
look a little more natural but I love
how this fronts became you really don't
have to do anything to it if you kind of
want a natural frontal and also if
you're not um too fond of plucking your
frontals to look for a listing this is a
nice firm so so I'm in love with that
and also another thing I love about this
here is that it is really affordable so
a lot of my subscribers were complaining
about the peerless hair and I lied being
expensive but this year I think for four
bundles it came to like 160 so that's a
really good deal not including the front
so but it was a really good deal and
also I'm not really having a problem
with shedding or tangling um as for the
two days that I did have it in but I'm
not going to say too much right now
because of course I'm gonna have to keep
wearing a hair for a couple of weeks but
of course I'm gonna let you all know but
I am really loving the texture and
another thing
is that a lot of hair has like a heavy
feel to it but this hair is super airy
it was super easy to curl and I had no
problems curling and straightening this
hair and also um I will be showing you
all how this hair look straighten if you
all were wondering because it is a
waterway so make sure you check the link
in the description box below because I
will have all of that of course you all
know that but it sounds like my voice is
cracking up again so I'm gonna be quiet
and I'll let you all go watch the little
tutorial on how I achieve this color but
I want to thank you guys so much for
watching and don't forget to Like
comment and subscribe and also if you
found this video helpful let me know and
yeah I will see you all in my next video
in and lookout for updates on this hair
so yeah bye guys okay so to achieve this
color I used the chroma to it in the
color chroma sangria and also the
L'Oreal hi color highlights in the color
magenta so they are both by L'Oreal but
they have two different purposes for
like coloring and stuff so the L'Oreal
hi color highlights in the color magenta
gives a more highlighting effect but
also it gives you a nice burgundy color
and I have experience coloring with this
before so I am familiar with this but
this is my first time coloring with the
true Reds chroma sangria so this was new
for me and eventually I'm going to end
up just dying all of the bundles with
the magenta color because the chroma
sangria the one that I'm mixing now well
was mixing it came out a very deep
cherry look which was the feeding the
purpose of which what I really wanted so
I just went back in and dyed the bundle
that I dyed with the chroma sangria and
I just dyed it with the magenta which I
should have different beginning but I
was trying something new and I just
wanted to show you all the trial and
error that I experienced so you all
won't you know make this mistake so this
is the 22 inch bundle and I'm going on
with the magenta color and for the next
one I'm going to show you all I'm dyeing
is going to be the 24 inch
and I'm going to die the 24 inch with
the UM chroma sangria color and you're
going to see that that color really
didn't come out so I'm going to let you
all see this process it's really
self-explanatory it's not really much I
have to explain and yeah I really didn't
go also I didn't go up to the to the
west of the hair because I didn't want
the whole hit to be burgundy
you know what I mean so I wanted to have
a dark root and then lighter ends so I
didn't go all the way up to the wealth
so this is the chroma SendGrid color I
was talking about and this is the 24
inch bundle so intentionally I wanted
the longest bundle to be the darkest
color so this is why I went with the
chromis in greer cuz i figured it was
going to be darker but it ended up not
even showing any type of color on this
bundle well the color was very very
subtle like you can see it in the
highest amount of sunlight but um yeah
you're gonna see how that turns out in
the end but i just let that sit and then
this is the 20 inch bundle and i'm going
in with the magenta again and I'm also
going to dye the least frontal with
magenta also but I did not show you all
how I did this on this video just so I
can show you all how to carefully bleach
here front so I'm gonna do a more
in-depth tutorial on that so I let this
sit overnight for 8 9 hours and this is
my result and as you can see right here
in the next clip that's um the chroma
sangría right here didn't even show up
like you can kind of see a deep cherry
but it was just too dark for what I was
trying to go for as the wig so I'm going
in with the magenta and this time I'm
using a 40 developer just so it can
process a little bit quicker and I left
that on for about two and a half hours
and it lifted to the burgundy that I
wanted so I was pleased with that and
then I went on and made my wig once
everything was air dry which you all
will see later on
you
so these were the finished results of
all of my three bundles died and also my
frontal so I was very pleased with how
he came out I mean if you do want to
intensify the color you can always go
ahead and just you the forty developer
and leave it on for a longer amount of
time but as I'm showing you can see that
the bottom is the darkest color which is
that very dark dark cherry color and I
just love how it looks it looks so
pretty crowd also but um yeah I just
like how the color sequence was going
and I was happy with the trial and error
so I mean I just learned not to deal
with that true red color unless I'm
doing maybe a lighter shade of hit on
hair instead of this dark brown but
right here I'm also showing you that the
hair does get pretty straight I did do
two passes and Max but I may have had to
do more than that just to get it extra
bone straight but I was going to curly
hair anyway so I really wasn't worried
about getting it you know bone straight
but I'm gonna show you all how it looks
with curls which is absolutely beautiful
it's my favorite look so far but I'm
gonna keep experimenting with this hair
and keep you all updated so yeah that's
basically all um thank you all so much
