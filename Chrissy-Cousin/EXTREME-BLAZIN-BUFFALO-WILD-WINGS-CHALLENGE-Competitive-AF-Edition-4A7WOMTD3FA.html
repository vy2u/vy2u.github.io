on each plate whoever touches their
drink first
the arm loses the challenge so women
wait yeah that's how I go over you yeah
so but you say no no napkins no drinks
no ranch
none of that stuff just the regular
wings okay so if I lose all right
what if you lose I want an
all-expense-paid girl one by trip to get
a full-body massage ah yes my that's the
point and if I win I want the same thing
