so today's video is going to be super
easy and simple and if you haven't
watched part one of this video make sure
you check that video out it will be
linked in the video and also in the
description box below so if you're
interested in seeing how I got this easy
beginner friendly color keep on watching
so as you guys may know you are very
familiar with laurio high color
highlights on my channel I did my hair
red one time with this brands but this
is now their copper color and all you
need is this maybe about three or four
boxes and a forty developer and you're
just going to mix that and as you can
see that was too much developers so I
ended up just adding another box so I
mixed that and came to a nice creamy
consistency and I basically just
distribute it back through the hair and
it's pretty much self-explanatory I'm
gonna try not to talk too much in this
video but that's basically all I did and
I purposely left the bundle in tech just
because I wanted those roots to be nice
and dark
so the bundle being in the bundle didn't
allow me to get dye on the roots so it's
pretty much simple just see how I do
this
and I also believe this would have went
by super quicker if I just parted a
bundle and I would have got it on the
strands much more easily but you're
gonna see I didn't do that with this
bundle but I did go in and do it later
on once I saw how easy it was to do it
on the second and third bundle
now onto this oh so lovely frontal a lot
of people are so amazed on how I don't
get color on my frontals and I'm like
it's super easy guys she just want to be
very very tedious and just try to avoid
getting the color on the lace that's
actually just the main key and making
sure you're putting just a little bit of
product on to the roots of the frontal
so as you can see I'm slowly just
combing out the hair being very gentle
and tedious and just distributing all of
that product on every strands and also
slightly going up to the root but it's
really not that hard I did make mistakes
earlier when I started making wigs and
it would just be all over the lace but
now I learned not to get now one drop on
the lace so it just takes practice and
you can just see what I'm doing right
here going in with the brush and then
combing it through to distribute all of
that product onto those strands
so once I finished dyeing my friend so I
went and checked on my bundles just to
see how they looked and I don't really
go up time on the box they tell you
generally how long you want to leave on
this dye but I kind of just eye it now
and this was probably 40 45 minutes and
I absolutely love this color this was
the first bundle which was the lightest
so and this is the frontal and I love
all the colors that came out this was
the longest bundle so the color was
super beautiful
I left each bundle processing for about
40 45 minutes and this was how the wig
looks after and once it's led on it
looks if this color is going no justice
on this camera but when I when I read it
when you get in the Sun the color is so
beautiful with this beautiful copper
fall autumn color and I just love it so
