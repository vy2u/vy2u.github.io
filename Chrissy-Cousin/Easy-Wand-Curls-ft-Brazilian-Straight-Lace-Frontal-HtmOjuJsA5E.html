welcome back to my channel so quickly
right before I get into this hair I
would like to say that the beginning of
this video is a paid sponsorship with
best fiends if you haven't heard about
that fiends on YouTube the app store any
of that I'm going to explain quickly
what it is right now so best fiends is a
free adventure game and where you have
to match up the matching little items on
the app and you get to defeat the black
slug so I believe that I'm on level 33
34 something like that but the game is
very challenging and it's a very nice
mind stimulating games so this is like I
said in the game you're just matching up
the same colored items and you build up
your team of things and where you defeat
the slug and the best fiends is
constantly updating their in-game events
and also by this month being Mother's
Day they do have a Mother's Day
challenge and where you can get through
sixteen challenges and you can unlock a
rare items also at the end of this month
best things will be releasing their
first animated short so make sure you
click that link below so you can
download the app for free and also make
sure you stay tuned for bootcamp and
before I end this little segment make
sure you click my link below so you can
get $5 worth of diamonds and gold that's
something that I really needed in this
game so if you're interested just make
sure you click that link and you can get
it for free so let's get into this hair
okay so first of all I know you guys are
wondering where have I been
and if you follow me on snapchat you
kind of can kind of figure out where
I've been or on Twitter my kind of
exciting off Instagram also but this is
my final week of classes so I'm super
excited about that I'm almost done but I
am super excited that I will be able to
focus more on my channel now that I'm
out of school and I don't have to worry
about juggling school and making units
for my clients and then making videos
and all that stuff so I will be able to
be more consistent on my channel and
give you all which you all really want
to see so now that that is all explained
hopefully you all kind of understand
what I'm going through because I kind of
do want to stay on top of my grades so I
don't have to take any classes over in
the summer or anything but I know you
guys are wondering about this hair so
this hair right here is their Brazilian
straight hair I received a 20 inch lace
frontal also a 28 28 26 and 26 or 28 28
26 24 something like that but in my hair
right now I only have a twenty eight and
a twenty six and also the 20 inch lace
frontals so this right here is only two
bundles of hair and I initially went for
this look just because I only wanted to
wear this hair bone straight and I hate
when hair is bone straight and it's just
like too thick you know what I mean I
kind of like for the hair to look kind
of natural so I went with the two
bundles in a lace front so because the
lace front Sultana stands for a bundle
itself so this hair was initially
straight I had been wearing it for about
three weeks to a month now I will insert
some pictures and clips of how I had it
straight just in case you all are
wondering and I'm sorry if I'm moving my
hands through it but I did just put
these curls in it if you kind of want to
see a short demo of how we got these
curls this will be towards the end of
the video but the curls are blonde curls
and they're kind of falling down um I
will be trying to put some flexi rods in
it tonight just to see how it holds up
because I don't know I like for my hair
to be big and curly you all know that
but this is some
long longhair this is the longest hair
that I have ever tried 28 inches um I
did use the Aussie moistu amp ooh and
conditioner that's basically all I use
for my extensions and you all kind of
have a general idea of that but when I
first got the hair I did bleach the
knots on the frontal I did pluck the
frontal and the frontal I actually
really really like the front because it
didn't come with um wood like that thick
thick thick hair line it kind of was it
was like a natural looking not a hair
line but it didn't have so much hair on
the front so to where I was like oh my
god I'm going to dread like plucking
this so that wasn't a problem another
thing is the hair did I'm gonna say de
get bone straight the first week then I
went to French Quarter fest and I kind
of sweated a little bit and then I went
the next day and I washed it and when I
wash it of course it waived up a bit and
then I bone straight it tried to bone
straight it again with my Denman brush
and my own baby list baby bliss Pro flat
iron I said baby bliss in my past video
but as a baby
list not baby bliss thank y'all for
correcting me on it but um I used those
two and I tried to get it going straight
and it didn't really bone straight ten
like I wanted it but then I did going
with cheese silk infusion just to see if
that helped it a bit and it kind of
didn't so I don't know what was the
problem with that maybe I didn't have my
heating setting well my head he said it
was on the highest but maybe I didn't do
it slow enough I really don't know but
um yeah that's with that and as for the
curls the curls are falling um if I
would have did another bundle of hair it
would have been much fooling also the
hair kind of does tangle and snag at the
ends the ants weren't the foolish
straight hair that I've ever had so it's
not a peerless or an ally grace but it
got the job
done for the look that I was going for
very bohemian looking but the ends were
not that for and it allowed the hair to
kind of get snagging and that that type
of area but as for um shedding no this
hair did not shed drastically I did cut
the West when I started to get two wars
at the top but that was just so that my
least friends who can lay a little bit
flatter but as for everything else the
hair is pretty good it does have a
little bit of feels like a kind of
filming residue to it I'm I'm really not
sure what the problem is with that a lot
of Le Express vendors that I review have
that kind of filmy residue once I wash
it and I'm always sure to wash out my
hair with all the shampoo out all the
conditioner out just so I won't have
that problem so I'm not sure what's the
problem with the Le Express here I'm not
sure if it's because its process or any
of them but this is very pretty on
camera but I'm just gonna see how it
looks when our flexi rod and yeah so
that's basically all I have the safest
and video so far um I'm not sure how to
be selling these units I do sell my
units after I review them but I think
that I'm gonna hold up just a second and
then do like a big sale so yeah this is
all I have to say for this video if you
have any questions make sure you ask
them in the comment section below and
also um I will have a little snippet of
how I got this look at the end of this
video so thank you all so much for
watching don't forget to Like comment
and subscribe and I will see you all in
my next video bye guys

palm trees waiting for the summer no
