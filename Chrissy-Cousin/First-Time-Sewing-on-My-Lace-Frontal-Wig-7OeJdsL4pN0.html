sweat on my hair and like what's the
process of me putting on my weight when
I wake up so since this one is sewn down
did use this little head scarf and I
don't even know where I got this from I
want to ask my sister because she gave
that one to me actually and this is my
globe by day satin bonnet on our
sentence products for video usage and I
didn't think I was going to like it this
much but I was able to pick from a
selection of colours and this was one of
the colors that I went to and it's
actually reversible so I can wear it in
two different colors so it comes in
black and then well it comes in burgundy
and then it comes with the flag so
that's really cool it has this little
just dream band right here so if you
have a small head you can make it
smaller and then you can tie it to
adjust it to your exact pant size and I
love that it's so cute it's so
comfortable in my hair stays silky is
shiny
I usually go with you know bonnets that
I can get from Walmart on my local
beauty supply store but this one was
amazing and I'm gonna wear this in my
next video just see how my curls hold up
because you all were asking me on my
snapchat to curl this hair when I posted
it a couple of days ago um so yeah I'm
gonna curl this hair so stay tuned for
that video so I'm gonna see how that
body works out but I'm loving it so far
and now for the hair spangle I have been
wearing this hair for about four days
now and it's holding them pretty well to
say that I had it you know stolen on my
head because I haven't had hair like I
haven't slept with hair and so long you
guys know that I use my elastic band
method and then I just take it off when
I come home I'm not going anywhere I'm
not wearing my way but now this is like
kind of like a sew-in so it's getting
like a lot to get used to it's a lot
adjusting knowing that like I have
being on my head so that's the only
thing but I mean you wake up and you're
all fleek so I mean I'm not complaining
about that this hair has been holding up
really good this is not the hair that I
had as a middle part on my snapchat I
would say snapchat because that's really
where I you know post pics or little
snippet videos of hair that I'll be
debuting on my channel so this is the
Brazilian straight hair from a latke
hair I will have all of the information
linked oh crap that scared me I would
have all of the information linked in
the description box below but this is
only two bundles of hair they only sent
me two bundles of hair so I mean if it
wasn't enough hair that just would have
been me but I think this is 24 inches
also once again I'll have all of the
information linked below usually with my
lace frontals
I use a frontal event about two bundles
so two bundles should have been enough
for 360 lace front so because you know
what at 360 the hair also goes to the
back so you have the hair in the front
one all the way around and then to the
back so I'm sure that would have been
enough hair but these bundles were super
pretty when I got on the package it
wasn't the most natural looking hair
when I got on the packet it was shiny
and it was pretty thin but I'm kind of
into the natural looking thinness of
straight hair when I'm doing wigs
I don't like thick straight hair and
that's kind of how my other wigs were
when I first started making wigs I used
like three bundles and a lace front so
so I'm not into that look anymore when I
want straight hair I want it to be
usually only straight so I'm not really
worrying about putting curls in it so I
just stick with two bundles now but this
hair has been giving me like so far it's
not the luster that I would preferably
pick out I kind of like for my hair to
have a low luster this one had a little
bit more luster so it's the luster
it's high that means it's a little bit
more shiny looking if the lustre is
lowest a little bit more dry looking if
you know what I mean but yeah I prefer
my hair to look just a little bit more
natural in the sheen section but other
than that this hair super soft one thing
about this hair is I haven't had any
problems with shedding light honestly
this hair has been amazing with holding
up on shedding tangling and the
three-state I haven't experimented with
the 360 parts of the hair yet I'm gonna
try to make a video on some of the
Styles put it in a ponytail going brave
because this is my first 360 once a week
so I do want to kind of experiment with
those type of aspects and also if you
guys like these kind of talk through
type of videos just let me know because
I know I gotta do a segment to work the
end of the videos when I'm doing reviews
I kind of do the reviews in the
beginning but if y'all don't want me
talking then I won't do it so just let
me know how y'all want me to do my
future review videos if you guys want me
to talk or not while doing my hair so
and I did cut a few layers in this hair
also you guys will see me actually doing
that in the video I tried to include as
much as I could in the video just so you
all can have a general idea from start
to finish on how I do my hair so I know
you guys are so curious on my snapchat
and I can't answer to everybody like
it's impossible I tried to and y'all
think I'm ignoring y'all but it
I don't know I'm actually not it's just
that I can't respond to all y'all but
then I post something on snap as a
general message just replying to y'all
but I'm very curious to see how this
hair will come out curled um super super
silky so I want to see how these curls
are gonna hold that's gonna be another
thing so I'll have a video contribute
- specifically that and I'm sorry if I'm
like looking all over the place I'm
looking into this big mirror in front of
me and then there's a mirror directly in
front of me so oh and another thing
about this hair I didn't even slow down
the bed because I didn't plan on join up
up styles or anything but I mean what's
the purpose of having a 360 for a wig if
you're not gonna you know wear it up or
anything but I do want to experiment
with this hair so that's gonna be like
my project for the next couple of videos
so and also in this video I'm showing
you all my process of putting putting
the thread through the lace and onto the
braid and I'm such a lazy person when it
comes to my hair I understand that with
lace frontals if you wanted to have a
longevity you're gonna have to glue down
a stocking cap on your head to mimic a
balding cap so it can be colored your
scalp but honestly I hate the mess I
hate the trial of just doing all of that
glue and taping and all I will never
tried taping but the glue like it's just
too messy and the cleanup process is
just so dreadful right on my other lace
frontal wigs
I have glue on them from trying with the
guys to the glue method and I I just
don't like that I don't think it should
be that complicated unless you know
you're switching hair like that but I
don't want to do the head with my wigs
like I'd rather just have it be stone
darling I actually really do prefer it
being sewn down down and I don't have to
worry about cleaning up glue on my
leaves frontal or on my forehead like I
can't stand that look so we're gonna
stick with the most minimal way possible
whipped lace frontals that's my goal so
I mean everybody has their specific
preference I do want to try this
specific glue caught both hold that one
looks like it's just less messy and
there
tave I saw that on Instagram I see like
their little videos and stuff so that's
why we the next thing that I'm gonna try
but other than that I don't I don't want
to do it I don't want to do it I don't
so we're gonna stick with the elastic
band and the snowing I think I'm gonna
stick with the sewing from now on but
I'm gonna see how it looks when I take
it down just so I make sure it's not
damaging my lace or anything like that
but you know that's basically all I
really have to say in this video I'm
gonna show you all how I you know got
this look from literally beginning to
end like I don't even know what else I
can show you all after this so I'm gonna
show you how I got this baby here it's
all away so make sure you stay tuned if
you all have any comments questions or
concerns make sure you leave it in the
comment section below but just make sure
I didn't say in the video or in the
description box first but I will have
all of the information on this hair and
also on this bonnet that I will continue
to use and tell you all how I like it so
yeah thank you guys so much for watching

subscribe and I will see you all in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
