stay low grandpa shine got you hey y'all
welcome back to my channel so I'm not
gonna talk too long and then begin in
this video because y'all say just get
straight to the point so I'm going to
try to talk a little fast but I want to
get as much information out in a short
period of time so as you can eyes good
luck see you guys don't brush me crap
that's what I like to take my time as
you all can see that this is the hair
that I had in my previous video this is
her hair company just some updates on
this hair I didn't do anything to the
hair but dye it and wash it about a week
- where did I also curled it but not
really I didn't cut the hair or anything
and cut any layers in it this is exactly
how the hair came other than me dyeing
it and yeah making a wig out of it so I
washed her hair and I realized that it
was much much drier than it was before
and of course that was caused by me
dyeing my hair but this is the hair
still it's three weeks in and I just
want to show you all that how versatile
like lace frontals are so in my previous
video I showed you all that I only use
the elastic band method I didn't use
glue tape or any of that but this time I
use the got to be gluten method and you
all will see the entire process of how I
did that it's not difficult as difficult
as I thought it was it's a little tricky
and it's really messy so you just have
to be mindful of those little things but
other than that um it's a really good
method to temporarily hold your lace
frontal because my lace frontal is on my
head like I love this this is Wow like I
wanted to know the hype behind got to be
glued and I'm glad I was able to try it
out you all will see my child in error
but um yeah this method does
it's really affordable and you can find
these products at your local beauty
supply store but I really am enjoying
this her hair company but this hair was
really thick and I can tell that is
actual like virgin brazilian hair just
because it was really really thick the
luster was very very low so the hair is
really good-quality I was able to
recover it from being dry
I love this length on me a super super
natural-looking but yeah this is my
three-week update on her hair company I
really don't have any complaints rather
than it being dry for me bleaching it
but that's on my behalf and I'm not pro
at all I'm going to try to perfect this
method but um it is kind of dry right
here but I'm going to figure out how to
you know fix that but other than that
everything came out really good it's
lame um but I'm going to show you all
the process so um yeah you all will see
how that went down so yeah that's
basically all I have a stand this
intro if you're interested and seeing
how I got this exact look I'm going to
be doing that in the video so stay tuned
so yeah don't forget to Like comment and
subscribe and let's get straight into
this tutorial
Hey
whatever
a friend
okay so this is the part where at the
gossipy glue gel and I've seen people
use the yellow and I actually have that
one too but this is in the black bottle
and they use this one just because they
say it's clear and it doesn't dry like
white like the other one so I use this
one and I only put one small amount
layer on the front of my hairline as you
can see what I'm doing now and I've seen
a lot of people put two or three layers
but I only did one and it came out
pretty good so I only blow-dried my hair
for 30 seconds and then you're going to
see me go in with the spray and this is
the got to be free spray and I wasn't
really paying attention to where I was
spraying this I didn't even know if I
wanted to spray it but I've seen people
do it so I just did it anyways I don't
know if it made a difference but um I
sprayed this on the front of my hairline
where I apply a glue and then um I'm
just going to blow-dry it again but I
sprayed this like on the hair on the wig
also as you can see but it didn't really
affect it so after I blow-dry this again
then I'm going to apply it the way
and if you're wondering what I'm doing
right here I'm simply just removing
those excess baby hairs that may have
gotten caught up in the glue when I was
applying the lace frontal on to the glue
so I'm just removing those with the
right tail comb just making sure they
don't get stuck in like frozen into
place before I blow-dry it and you are
going to see how I do this process but
one mistake that I do regret is um
holding my finger on the lace frontal I
blow drying it because as you can see
like right here I'm like blow drying the
glue and my hair together so therefore
the hair was kind of sticking to the
lace frontal and it wasn't really as
flowy as I would like so just be mindful
of your hand placement I would suggest
that you just use a comb a very small
rat tail comb to apply the pressure to
the frontal and the front of your
forehead so yeah that's just one tip
that I would um take it next time and
just be mindful of
Oh
so once I made sure that the godson
glued had my friend so secured it was
actually very very secure and I was
super surprised but as you can see I'm
just using the right tail comb to kind
of break up the cast that's the glue and
the freeze spray got on to the actual
hair so I'm just running my fingers
through it and I'm also going to use the
rat tail comb to just kind of comb a
back and forth like I'm doing right here
and just breaking up like the
crunchiness that was caused by the glue
Oh
so for my baby hairs I used the BB foam
moisturizing wrapping lotion and I just
used one pump and then I applied that to
the front of my baby ears and I just
combed it with a toothbrush and I know
in my previous video I use the Chi
helmet head spray and that leave my baby
hairs but for this one I wanted to try
something different and I wanted more of
a feather look so I really like how this
turned out okay now to set my baby hairs
to have them laid for the next day I
think that this was a key part in to
getting my frontal to look how we did so
I got a sanics wrapping strip well yeah
I think that's what CNX grabbing stroke
and I folded it in half and then I just
wrapped that around my head and then
after this I'm just going to style my
hair as I regularly would and just to
make sure that my baby hairs aren't
flying everywhere and it's just out of
the way and I know they're going to be
late and slate the next day so now I'm
just going to continue with styling my
hair in my indecisiveness so I'm not
going to talk during this part I'm just
going to let you all ride the wave
Oh
you
Oh
can see his
and till you discover it is within each
other as you forgive and may come
I am no man
I took the long road
but I'd be better on my
sometimes arthritis
instead
you
all righty so this is the next morning
and my hair stayed in place thank God I
mean I had enough wrapping stuff around
it for it to so I'm simply just going to
remove all of these bobby pins and cut
off the sanic strip and look at my baby
here I'm sorry it really hurt when I was
trying to take it off but my baby hairs
was literally like frozen onto my
forehead which I didn't mind at all
because I like for my hair to be in
place and when I tell you these things
stayed all day and so did my frontal
they stayed all day and I was really
excited to try these new little styles
so I'm just want to show you all just a
few styles that I tried with my frontal
just because I wasn't going to go
anywhere and I was going to slide off my
head because it didn't just have the
elastic band so I really had a lot of
fun experimenting with this so
all righty so this will conclude my
first attempt for the gosset igloo
method I really enjoyed this and I will
continuously use this product because it
does indeed work but I'm not perfect and
I'm not a professional but I'm glad that
I tried and found out the hype behind
this but if you all have any questions
comments or concerns just let me know in
the comment section below and I will see
you all in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
