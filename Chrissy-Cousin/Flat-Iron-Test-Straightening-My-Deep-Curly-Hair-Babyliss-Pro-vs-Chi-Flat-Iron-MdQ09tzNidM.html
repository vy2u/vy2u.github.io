today's video is going to be something
different that I never did on my channel
so well this is something different for
me also so one thing I've never done
what I had extension it actually tries
to straighten my curly extensions so
today's video is going to be dedicated
to me attempting to straighten this hair
this is the Malaysian Dee curly hair
from beauty forever hair if you all have
not checked out my previous review on
this hair and make sure you go check it
out
you already know the drill that will be
linked in the description box below
so make sure you click that link and
also I have a giveaway for two lucky
winners so if you're interested in some
bundles similar to this make sure you go
check out that video also but straight
into this hair I know I don't want to
make this video long at all but I do
have two fires right here this is my Chi
one you guys are a bit familiar with
this one I have used this one in my
previous videos so this is my cheap iron
and I got this from also I'm not sure
what the temperature goes up to on this
one with this right here is a new flat
iron that I've heard so many great
things about and this is the baby bliss
Pro titanium Xtreme flat iron and this
goes up to 450° and they have little
settings on the side also so you can
adjust it and mine is currently on 25 so
these are the supplies I'm going to be
testing out on this hair but this is
just the natural air dried texture of
the hair and um nothing's in it so I'm
not going to use any products and I want
to use my diet and straightening brush a
lot of people ask me how to get my other
types of hair bone straight and this is
the key right here I will have this link
in the description box below also it's
from Amazon it's like six seven dollars
so this is the one I'm going to be using
I'm not going to straight my whole head
because I'm just not let's get straight
into the video
so this is all the hair that I've
sectioned off I'm going to leave the
rest in the bun and I'm just going to
section off this right here is too small
of these is just so it can be a little
bit easier for me to manage so on the
left side I'm going to be using my Chia
and on the right side I'm going to be
using the baby bliss - let's see how
these two work out I think this one's
going to work better because they say
titanium um cutting up some more heat or
something like that so I don't we'll see
okay so this is the cheese side I went
over two times and this is how straight
it got it's not bone going straight and
I don't know I'm top it's kind of
straight but the ends or a little bit
frizzy I'm gonna see how it holds up
while I play on this side what's the
baby bliss and see what the difference
is
okay so this is the finished results of
the key side and the baby blue side I
wouldn't say that the baby website is
necessarily better than the cheat at
this moment because both of the sides
are freezing up and it hasn't even been
straightened for 20 minutes I'm not sure
if I was blow-dried it if it would have
um straight and better but I doubt it
but um no product was added to this and
this side was starting to frizz up while
I was flat ironing this side and I know
that that has to do with the share being
thin and just fluffy and just not really
thick so I hold the heat I don't know
another reason why I didn't want to
straighten my entire head just because I
know that it's going to freeze up if you
want hair that's going to curl and be
able to get bone straight I don't think
that this will be um the hair for you
because as you can see is not saying
straight and I wouldn't say that I would
choose this over my cheek I will have to
use it on some body wave or straight
hair just to get like the final my final
thoughts on this the next thing is just
seeing if it reverses back to the curly
texture which I'm pretty sure that it
will because it didn't really take too
much heat but I'm just gonna use my
spray bottle and just spray the area
with water no conditioner just nothing
I'm just going to spray it with water
and see it's a reverse bag so
it's already were you hit up another
thing when I was flat ironing it they
had a lot of flyways I thought that was
popping up when I was putting the Flair
and threw it so I'm pretty sure that
that could be another reason when it
here
didn't your bonus trick just because of
all those flyaways if not wanting sewing
down but this hair is starting to wait
out without having to run it under like
water or use conditioner okay so both
sides reverted back to the natural hair
texture as for straightening it I
wouldn't suggest you buy this hair if
you want to have a versatile look
because I'm more than sure about an hour
later it's going to be frizzy and just
like a poofy mess I would get curly hair
for curly body wave hairs to straight in
an hour straight hair or loose weight to
either straighten so um that's another
thing when my curly hair I never got it
with intentions to want to have it to be
versatile um I usually just got curly
hair to wear it in the curly state
because I'm pretty sure that I knew that
it wouldn't get blown straight so that
is basically all I had to say for this
video thank you all so much for watching
once again if you haven't checked out my
initial review for this hair make sure
you check it out and also some links for
every product that I use in this video
the giant straightening brush and both
of my flat our eyes will be linked below
also and I'm not sure if I'm gonna do an
update on this hair just because it's
kind of hot outside
and the curly hair is a bit much so I
think I'm going to go back to another
texture because as you can see this is a
lot of tinner and it's a little bit too
much to manage in the weather but um if
not you all kind of know my update on
the hair and how I feel about it
and also if it straightens so yeah the
hair is really nice it's just that it's
a bit too hot for me right now and um
yeah the curls are beautiful it's just
that the texture is really really fluffy
and airy and the curls kind of get a bit
frizzy just because of the texture in
that um the density of the hair is not
that thick to wear can hold a defined
curl on so long but um the hair is nice
but you know that's um that's basically
all I have to say for this video and
this hair so um you know once again
thanks so much for watching don't forget

see you all in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
