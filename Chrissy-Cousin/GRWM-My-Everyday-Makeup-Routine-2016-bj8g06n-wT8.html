channel so this video was highly
requested by my subscribers so if you
all want to see how I do my makeup when
I'm going somewhere this is not everyday
but it's super simple
so if you guys are interested is cute on
a watching so firstly I start off with
my eyebrows and I like to use my
anastasia beverly hills dipbrow pomade
in the color
evany and if you all want an in-depth
tutorial on how i do my eyebrows just
let me know in the comment section below
i already have a tutorial on how i do it
but i have very much upgraded and have
new techniques so yeah if you don't want
to see that just let me know and I would
do that for you all but after I do my
eyebrows I like to prime my skin with
the Mac prep and prime skin base village
and I like to apply the prep and prime
on my entire face and then I go in with
the Too Faced Prime's and poreless
primer and I just put that in the areas
where my pores are visible and it just
helps blend them out so flawlessly
and then I'm going to go back to the
eyebrows and I'm going to conceal them
and make them look more perfected and
all that stuff and this is my favorite
part because it just carves them out and
makes them sharp looking and yeah I just
enjoy doing this part so
and just so everything blends well with
my foundation I use this blender that I
got from my beauty supply store and it
was too hard on my skin so the point tip
on it I just used it to blend out for my
concealer on my eyebrows and this is my
other eyebrow that I did off of camera
once again if you all once you see an
ends up tutorial just let me know in the
comment section below and I would just
do that for you all but now I'm about to
color correct my under eye dark circles
and this is the LA girl Pro concealer in
the color orange and I'm so happy I
discovered this stuff because I can
literally see the difference in how my
makeup looks with my foundation applied
and everything once I conceal in color
correct my under eye so I'm so happy I
discovered this stuff and I'm just using
my small tiny cute Beauty Blender which
is dampened to blend that out and after
that I'm going to go in with my
foundation and the two foundations I use
is the covergirl Queen all-day flawless
three and one in the color golden honey
and I use about three pumps of that and
then I'm going to add one drop of my
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
foundation in the color 340 cappuccino
and I love this combination together
because I have very dry skin so if I
just add the matte and poreless fit me
foundation my skin is going to look over
dry and flaky and crumbly and I just
hate that so by the covergirl foundation
not being full-out met or dewy the
combination is just so amazing and the
coverage is so bomb so yeah I'm just
going to blend that out with my favorite
blending sponge and this is the Real
Techniques sponge and it is dampened
with water I feel like the coverage goes
on so much easier and it blends out so
much better when the sponge is damp so
that's just what I prefer and just be
sure that if you are following a my
routine if you have dark circles make
sure that you blend out your foundation
into the orange corrector because you
want to be setting your face and realize
that you have orange corrector under
your eye so just make sure everything is
blended out perfectly so once all my
foundation is applied and blended out
i'm going in with my la girl Pro
concealer in the color warm honey and
I'm going to apply that under my eyes on
the bridge of my nose and I'm going to
go back in with that small tiny Beauty
Blender and with the pointed side not
the flat side that I did my color
correcting with I'm going to go in with
the pointy side and blend that all out
and I used to blend out my concealer
with my Real Techniques blending sponge
but I'm so happy that I found out about
this small Beauty Blender because it
just helps blend and smooth out
everything so flawlessly and by it being
so small it's so much more easier to get
into those small little places on your
face and we're just going to keep
blending blending blending blending and
more blending and we're going to do this
to the other eye also and also to my
nose but if you all want an in-depth
tutorial on how to highlight and contour
and just let me know and I will do a
talk through or voiceover however you
all want it just let me know in the
comment section what you want to see or
anything in depth just let me know
and to contour my face I will be using
the black opal true color stick and it
is in the color sweet mocha and I'm
going to bring this down the sides of my
nose where I highlight it just to make
it look kind of thinner I don't have a
big nose but I just want to define it
and make it look more structured so that
is what I'm going to be doing and once I
do that I will be blending that out with
my small Beauty Blender once again
and then I'm going to contour my
cheekbones is that what you call it my
cheekbones
I don't know Chico I want to define my
face with the color stick also and I'm
going to use this morphe brush for all
the brushes that I use for each section
of my face or sponges just check the
description box I will have it listed
below the name and everything and what I
use all which part of my face and I use
that to define my cheekbones and then
I'm going to use this Real Techniques
brush to just contour my forehead and
warm up my face a little and I
absolutely love this brush on my
forehead and to blend everything out on
this area because it just smoothes out
everything so perfectly I love it I
don't use a sponge on this area but this
brush work so this is what I use for an
elm
you
so now I'm going to set my highlighted
areas with my setting powder and in this
little container is the Sasha Buttercup
powder and also the Laura Mercier
translucent powder and they say Laura
Mercier powder does not have flash bags
but it's a little too white for me when
I brush it all I don't know if I'm doing
something wrong but I like to mix both
of them together because Sasha is a
little too yellow
so then mix together just has the most
perfect look of what I'm going for and
it does the job so if you all have any
suggestions just let me know but this is
what I'm doing right now and it's
working for me
so yeah so I set under my eyes where my
concealer was under my contour just to
sharpen it up and also on the bridge of
my nose and a lot of people bake but
that's mostly for oily skin types but
you all like you heard before me thing
is that I have dry skin so baking for
too long is just want to overdrive my
skin and that's not what I'm going for
that's defeating the purpose of my whole
foundation routine so after about a
minute and 30 seconds I sweep all of
that off and if it looks a little white
or ashy right now don't worry about that
because I'm going to show you how to fix
it and how to get that flawless finish
and to set my contour areas I will be
using the black radiance soft focus
finishing powder in the color creamy
bronze finish
and for blush I will be using my
favorite blush which is by Black
Radiance also and it is in the color
toasted element and I'm just going to
apply that to my cheeks and just add
some color to my face because it looks a
little bit washed out now so this takes
care of that and now on to my favorite
part of the makeup process which is
highlighting if you know anything about
me off of Twitter and snapchat then you
know this is literally all I talk about
but this is my favorite thing to
highlight with it is actually an
eyeshadow from the company Kiko Milano
but me and a lot of others use it as
highlighters and it is literally the
best thing ever invented like I can't
live without it it's so amazing that I'm
applying that to the highest point of my
cheeks and then on my brow bone I will
be using a large Ellis gilded honey
which I just got my hands on I was
sleeping on this product like I should
have been had this but I'm also going to
apply to the bridge of my nose and look
at that highlight is so fun so fun and
before I apply my lashes I like to line
my eyelids with eyeliner and just so it
would kind of camouflage the band this
eyeliner is from Inglot and it is in the
color 77 it is they are AMC eyeliner gel
and I absolutely love it because it's
super jet black and it goes so smoothly
on the eyes
so announcer lashes i will be using two
brands the first brand is car eyelashes
in the number WSP and the other is salon
perfect in the number 615 and I like to
double stack these they give me that so
glam look like mink lash look but for a
cheaper price eyelashes will seriously
transform your whole makeup look and
what I love about these eyelashes is
that the bands are invisible so by me
stacking them it does not have a thick
fill on the eye and it's super
lightweight and anything irritates my
eyes so this doesn't irritate it so
that's what I love about it and for my
mascara I will be using my Rimmel London
scandalous eyes and to line my lips for
my lipstick I will be using NK Auto lip
liner in the color chuckle infra
lipstick I will be using satchel
buttercups lipstick and the color over
the top over the tube I will have it in
the description box below and for lip
gloss I will be using my favorite lip
gloss by NYX and it is in the color
Madeleine and you can never have too
much highlight so you know you know how
that's going to go
and after I'm finished putting that
extra highlight on I'm going to spray my
face with the mac fix+ spray and this
just helps me just blend everything out
it literally fixes everything
it helps to get rid of those harsh lines
from your contour and highlight and also
most of all it gets rid of that as you
look from your setting powder and I just
love how it just blends and smoothes out
everything it gives your face such a
flawless finish and then to set that I
will be spraying my face with the skin
Danai via the finishing makeup spray and
this is in the oil control type and it
just helps my face from oiling up and
makes it last all day I absolutely love
it
and this is my finished look I really
