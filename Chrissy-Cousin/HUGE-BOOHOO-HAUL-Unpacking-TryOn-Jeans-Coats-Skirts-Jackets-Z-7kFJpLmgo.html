guys so this is part 2 of my Black
Friday Cyber Monday haul and like I say
I just want to be two parts because the
first part was probably going to be
pretty long if it's not been it's still
part two so and if you're wondering
what's in the background right here
these are all of the boxes that I just
unbox for my part one so if you haven't
checked out part one make sure you go
check that one out before you watch this
one that was a shoe and makeup haul so
make sure you go check that one out if
you missed it cuz all this is what I
just a box so so this part is just one
of me everything that I bought from
boohoo I literally went to that site I
think three times and one day it was
like I need more but if I didn't mention
boohoo is one of my favorite stores I am
a person that likes affordable things I
literally do not splurge on things that
I really do not need so since I am on a
budget booboo is like the perfect place
to purchase your clothes they have so
much high quality clothes and all of
their clothes are just so beautiful in
their affordable that's what I love so
much about it and this video is not
sponsored so don't think you know I'm
just saying this because but their
clothes are amazing our loans so much
and I always purchase from there so this
is the one I'm about to show you that I
bought it's a lot of stuff so bear with
me and just grab you some popcorn and
watch so so obviously we're excited to
purchase from the store this store had
50 they have 60% off everything
everything everything so um the first
time I went on the site I was trying to
focus on getting more like winter
clothes um in Louisiana they really
don't have cold weather but when it gets
cold it is like kind of chilly but it
lasts for like three days
and then it's back to 80 degrees so
therefore I didn't get too much but I
got some stuff that I will probably wear
if it gets cool down here or a case you
know traveling and we go somewhere I
will have some cute like clothes you
know so I didn't get much of winter
stuff but I did get some the first thing
that I got was this jacket right here
and I'm just gonna unpack all this stuff
view I won't have to hear all this noise
so come and do that and come back on
here okay so the first thing I heard it
was jackets so um I have a lot of
jackets already but these were just so
so cute and I think I own one jacket
similar to these but these colors were
just so Kim Kardashian II so um the
first one is the Olivia sleeveless
waterfall coat in the color mocha and
this comes in one size and it comes with
a build so this is how it looks and it
doesn't have sleeves on it so your arms
show but it's so cute and I got this and
two colors and the other color I got it
and was um camel so it's just the camel
one right here and it's just so cute and
it's like I said their quality is
amazing it doesn't feel like paper or
then it actually feels like something
that you know has good quality to it so
these are the two ones that I got in the
same color and the next to is called the
Kate belted shawl collar coat and this
one the first one is in the color camel
I love like new colors it's so in and
you can wear with anything you know so
this is the camel one this one also
comes with a belt but this one has
sleeves it's similar to the other one
all of these pretty much look the same
but you know you can style them
different and this one it's also long
I'm gonna try it on so you all can see
how it looks but I like this right here
- it just looks so fun is in the exact
same color it's just in an olive green
color and that is it's in the color
khaki so just in case you want to go on
the site it's khaki so the next one that
I got is called the poppy festival
bomber and this is in the color stone
and I have about I have two bombers that
I purchased from their site before the
sell and also um a festival parka and I
love oh my gosh they're so amazing and
they keep me so warm so this is just the
other one that I purchased on Black
Friday so the next jacket the last I get
I think is just the jean jacket and this
is Jodie oversized mint blue boyfriend
jacket and also this isn't a coat this
is gonna science us 12 I purposely got a
big just because I like oversized things
and I don't know jean jackets I have
spinach jean jackets so I don't need
anymore those so I just figured getting
the oversized one this was the biggest
one on the site I believe I don't think
I would have so 14 but this is a 12 and
I plan on like distressing this and kind
of like putting bleach on it to make a
design on its own okay so I'm not quite
done with the jackets so for the is more
cardigan so these are cardigans that I
also got and this one is also in the
color khaki I'm in love with like olive
green khaki nude all of that stuff so
this is the jasmine peach rum maxi
waterfall cardigan and I absolutely love
cardigan so once again it's just
something that you can throw on and go
so this is how this one look
and it comes all the way down it's super
super long the next cardigan I got is
this one I love this color it's so
pretty this is the Jasmine side split
maxi cardigan and the color mocha and
this isn't this smell it smell good and
this one just has like rips in the side
so yeah and this material their material
quality is so amazing
I love it oh and all of the way so all
of the UM jackets that I showed you all
was one size only and the cardigans are
in medium to large just in case you are
wondering I like for my things to fit
big and oversize so this is medium large
and the other thing that I ordered in
that package also was these two heads
and they're so cute the first one is the
Rebecca shrill B hat in the color camel
and this is so cute like this goes to my
outfit right now
oh my gosh I love these hats you can
just put them on with some cute boots
some cute flats and just go oh my gosh
so freakin cute and this one is this one
doesn't even have a thing on it okay so
this one is called the Lord wool mix
ribbon band Fedora that's too long so um
this one is a little bit more wider but
this color I was just like jazz
yes so the nice funky oh my god
this full adorable stone yeah this was
the second hat that I got so that was
the second package this one is the Fria
camel utility festival jacket in the
color khaki and the size medium/large
and like I said all of this stuff was
60%
Oh sixty and I just wanted a burglar
camouflage jacket um I have one that's
more like thicker than this and more
darker and more camouflage but I don't
know this one was just cute and if it
had three left in stock so I was like
whatever I thinking like I don't know
how much it was but it was cheap and you
can't go wrong with a camouflage jacket
so this is how it looks now I'm
officially done with the jacket okay so
the next thing they might show you is
pretty much is regular clothes everyday
clothes and jeans some I start off with
the cold um the first thing I got is
called a are let slinky luxe relaxed
jogger in the color khaki and I do not
remember purchasing this honestly I
really don't and I don't know one person
that said but this is how it looks
um it's very slinky like it says and it
just comes um it cuffs at the bot well
not cuffs but it looks like a grifter on
your ankles so I don't know I don't know
how I feel about this but I don't even
remember ordering so whatever uh next
thing is a Lexie boxes crock in midi
skirt oh and this is a corset
I remember get in this one and this is
so adorable look how this is a crop um
shirt a white regular crop shirt and it
just comes with a black skirt a
high-waisted skirt so they go well with
each other a crop top and then a
high-waisted so that's going to be super
cute and this is in the this isn't a
size 10 so this I wear eight regular and
I don't want the shirt to be too small
so I got a 10 so I think this is gonna
fit
they their sizes run super weird like
I'm usually probably a six but when I
used to artist six in the past it was
just too tight too small and always had
to return it or like give it away so I
just little bit eighth and tenth and
sometimes twelve it just depends on what
it is you like in this one I got a 12
because these are softy metallics like
highways leggings and you know that time
for high waters Oh
how these leggings look you're literally
leggings and honestly I don't know why I
got them oh my god I don't know why I
got these things all this stuff with my
super affordable first of all this
didn't look like this on the website so
oh no a lot of these love it mmm
okay I don't know but this is what
happens when everything is 60% off okay
so the next thing is Harriet pocket
school book crimp Creek skinny trouser
in the color mocha this is also in a
size 12 and I know these are going to
fit so cute and this material is kind of
stretchy but it's still thick so the
next thing is um Layla's monochrome
stripe longer line why these name so
long lalla monochrome stripe longer line
miniskirt in the color black and this is
also in a size 12
okay so I got a couple of these because
I just love their um bodysuit
turtlenecks so this is the Limi
turtleneck body basic body in the color
Navy and this is in a size 8 and I just
love their body suits and this is like a
true true blue it's so pretty I just
love it so much and it comes down and
you can just button it at the
bottom you could just wear jeans or
skirt or shorts over it so this is the
first color I got and I also got it in
the color camel and also wine so this is
y and this is camel so anything on below
that's camel is new and khaki is like
green on there so just in case you know
you're confused about the coloring
that's what that is and the next thing
is it's skirt I think I remember this
cool oh yeah this one this materials
nice this is that so this is the Bella
metallic stripe midi skirt and this is
black in the color swirl and this looks
like it's gonna be too big but um how I
could've did a size 10 in this I don't
know why I got a 12 but yeah this is the
12 but this color is so cute in this
material so nice nice okay
so the next thing is oh these are pants
Oh cute okay so these are the Katerina
little crop these names are like so I
don't ya okay so cutting that monochrome
jincan skinny trouser multi in the color
soils see now they look like they're
gonna fit in a size 12
see that's I'm talking about like with
their sizes you could be a 8 a 10 or 12
it's just like so weird these you
actually look too small but there were
12 but that skirt was too big looking oh
my gosh I don't know it's just the risk
you take when you order off of a website
they just kind of like throw yourself in
that water and you get what you get you
know just got to see what works but yeah
neither have you look in there long
I don't think these will look crazy on
me so they're so cute so that was the
third time I order from boohoo in a day
so now on to my favorite triggered part
and a part that I actually took a real
big risk on because like I said I like
surprising to the hell so genes girls we
know tall girls genes can be an issue we
don't have the luxury of just going in
places and finding genes that don't
become high waters on us so we have to
just like kind of figure out what gene
brand works best for us and just stick
with it because if not you're going to
have genes up over your ankles and it's
just going to look weird so I was happy
with these right here so hopefully they
look good so I know a forever 21 I was a
size 27 or 28 or 29 in between that
range but the genes were just not long
at least some of them weren't so um I
really took a big risk order from booboo
with this I just went off the model and
I don't know
so I'm not I'm scared to try it on but I
got a lot of hair
which I really probably shouldn't have
but you know if they don't fit I'll just
give them away the boodle takes so long
to come in so I probably wouldn't return
oh my god these qualities are so good oh
my god these are like really jeans look
at this Wow okay so these are in a size
us eight oh my gosh why did I get this
okay so this is a size eight they look
short and small oh my gosh okay so this
is a size us a I am gonna try these on
just so you all can see and you all are
a taller girl you can just know if they
work for me you know okay so these are
on the mission mid-rise skinny jeans in
the color mint blue hopefully they fit
Mischa these are the Kelly blue wash
high rise skinny jeans in the color blue
and these are 12 that's what I'm saying
those were a these are 12 and oh either
Wang will be wrong okay so these may fit
I'm excited to try these on okay so I'm
not gonna give up right now they look
like they fit pretty good next ones are
a US size 8 again and these are the
selfie high-waisted split me skinny
jeans pale blue in the color 12 and
these are how they look oh these are
nice too and they have little splits in
the UM me which is really nice
and either also they feel like the
quality they're not like jegging and the
last one I got was the Laurel letdown
hem tube jeans boo it says boo but I
think they meant to put blue blue in the
in the size 10 so some of them were size
eight someone more size 10 or someone
were size 12 and these are cute I saw
these on the model not like oh my god
they're so cute lead arm of a jegging
material but they stretch and they're
high-waisted as you can see super cute
and I'm try those on and see how they
fit and if not then I know I won't order
from there anymore for jeans but if they
do then I know where I can purchase good
quality jeans from so yeah I think this
