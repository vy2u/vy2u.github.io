channel so I'm super excited for this
video because it's a long long long
awaited especially for my snapchat
viewers so if you're not really a little
bit less you would get you yeah so if
you're not already following me on
snapchat make sure you follow me at
Chrissy colors that's all my social
media accounts and yeah that's mostly
where I am when I'm not on here and I
like to connect with my subscribers and
viewers and all that stuff on that site
so on that site about three weeks two
weeks two weeks lo um all of my
shipments from Black Friday Cyber Monday
started coming in and I was like this is
a lot of stuff so I'm going to do a haul
on it and that's what I want to do right
now a lot of people was asking me when
are you going to do this haul did your
stuff come in like it's been two weeks
and I was like I know but all the stuff
didn't come in all at once um actually
one of the pegs you just came yesterday
so I'm finally coming on here and
showing you all all the stuff that I got
so it's gonna be so exciting I got a lot
of stuff and I can't wait to show you
all and another thing is that I haven't
opened not one well I didn't open my
uggs mouth I didn't know about us but I
didn't open anything else so anything
that I see right now is going to be the
first time I see it and also if I don't
like it you're not gonna see how I feel
about it so I'm super excited and I
can't wait to get this video started and
another thing is if you haven't realized
the quality of this video does it look a
little different yeah I got new lens
so hopefully the quality is much better
than the other videos that I put up a
lot of people said they loved the
quality of my other videos so thank you
but I like this so much better oh my
gosh your figure guys okay so let me get
into this video because I know you
like your ratings so all of this right
here is what I will be unpackaging on
this video hopefully this is not last
too long because it is kind of late I
want to do this earlier but you got to
do it okay so let's get all right
oh my gosh okay okay so the first day
I'm going to start with his shoes and
these are all of the shoes right here I
don't remember how many pairs it was oh
that's clear back there um I don't
remember how many pairs it was but my
mother remember right now so I'm gonna
get my razor okay so the first shoes I
want to start with is my uggs okay so
hugs they came out with this new style
of the classic shorts or the I think is
in the classic short and tall but I got
the short ones and they also had a sell
on some of their older styles so it was
like 30% off so that was a really good
deal so I ended up getting three pairs
of us off of deadside okay so the first
pair that I got is the classic short
ones and this is the classic short two
so this is the ones that are waterproof
and these are how they look like this
and they're so cute and they're super
comfortable I love them I only wore them
one time which was yesterday and they
were super comfortable my feet were not
hurting not one bit
so I am happy with this purchase and
this is how they look my sister posted
it on her snapchat of her um putting
water on them and it is water repellent
so that was a good thing this is what I
like about them
also and these were 160 and it was free
shipping but this is the first car got
in all of the shoes that were were in
eight and a half so just in case you
were wondering so the other two I got
from the ugh website was these two so
what's the name of these I think you
know these are called
the classic short croco so I'm guessing
because they do look like crocodile skin
I'm pretty sure it's not real crocodile
screen I don't know but they were on
sale and they were 110 so each of these
were one thing they were regular for 160
or something like that I'm not really
sure but I figured it was a good deal
they had all sizes available at the time
and it was on black it was on Black
Friday
yeah so I want to say I was on Black
Friday and I was like okay so that's a
good deal
um and they were super cute but when I
received them they were like super duper
big like they look like spaceship shoes
I don't know I don't tell me what you
guys think um like my look how the
classic short ones in these look they
just look super duper big and like why
so I was thinking about returning these
but I'm really not sure when I tried
them on
they look like spaceship shoes but then
I can maybe my mind was just like no
tricks on me I'm not sure but I don't
anyway you guys think these are also an
eight and a half so I'm not really sure
if I want to return them I have to think
about it see how I feel and just look at
them just a little bit more make sure my
tripping but those are the three pairs
of ups that I got and I haven't one
dated I literally just took these out of
the box to do so I am so and the next
pair of shoes that I got were adidas and
these are called the tubular define
these are call it the tubular defiant in
there in the color black and I just want
to like some black all black tennis I
don't have all black pants I have like
black and white black and red red and
white but I just want it playing black
so I want to blow in that Indies and
they're so cute I saw my website and I
was like oh my god these are so freaking
cute and either 30 they're like their
heart but they're so cute and I think it
will go well they will go with anything
because they're black so I'm happy with
this purchase and I haven't tried these
on yet but I will try to insert a clip
and let you all know if they look or
feel comfortable but they look
comfortable so oh no so those were from
adidas and that was also in eight energy
so though
oh the next pair shooter that was from
the journeys website and I got those of
use from Macy's calm just in case you
were wondering and these are from
journeys
these are vans oh I don't even remember
what I purchase ice okay so these are
the I remember these are just two all
Bernie vans I do have the black and
white ones and I love them literally my
favorite shoe design they're so
comfortable to me and I like how they
like rise up to your ankles so I was
like I want the burgundy one and they
were on sale also so why not so these
are how they look these are how they
look and I just so cute anything
burgundy is just so refreshing looking
and I don't know these are gonna look so
cute oh my gosh I can't wait the room so
yeah nothing major is just the Bergen
one okay so the next pair of shoes I got
is also for Macy's these are not tennis
or anything but these are believe boots
are just free open them I think
McDonald's line of shoes I don't know
really not worried about that but they
were sitting chewed on the side and they
were buy one get one 50%
no buy a pair get a pair free on Black
Friday so I got this pair and I don't
know one of the tenants over here I got
free or when I bought the tennis I got
this one free so that was stupid to
build well like I was literally hustling
on every website trying to get these
deals like 50% off 70% off I was getting
them so these are how the shoes look
they are um they come above my knee
which I wanted because all suppose that
I have now they come below my knee so I
really like these and they look cute on
the on the model on the website and also
another thing I like the baldies it's a
little elastics tracking of that so I
don't have like the thickest legs so by
this being in the
that I'm able to make sure that this
stays on my leg so I really like that
and this is in in eighth and in half
also and they have a little hill on the
bottom so this is really cute and I
really like this color they didn't have
the color I really wanted which is the
new so I settled for the gray and I'm
happy with it so so I think that's all
for the shoes I want to check the box
and make sure I don't have anything else
this is a lot of stuff Sonia the birth
is up in two parts so yeah I'm just
gonna okay okay so I found another lots
of shoes yeah last tile is literally
been two and a half weeks since I
ordered this stuff so I don't even
remember ordering some of this stuff
don't mind me if my memories kind of
like all over the place
so these okay so these are three pairs
of Pumas a day I remember which ones I
ordered exactly also so this is okay so
the first one is the suede classic monel
um something woman but I don't leave it
on one that we wanted either the red
ones and I have this these are how they
look and I have these in the
Metz color so I just wanted them in the
break a leg to close
I don't know they're super cute and I
like them and these are in an 8 and a
half so these these are the ones that
won't already and these are the ones
that I just got so the next pair is um
the sweet platform gold so yeah I don't
know where these I fell in love with
these on the site I saw like okay I have
to get up and I think these are recent
ones so I mean why not and they were on
sale I believe written these are the
suede platform ones and what were they
to my attention was this little thing I
hear is not metal but it's like I don't
know um but it's cute and I like this um
little platform to in this color is just
so pretty and I love the cooler
collection of shoes they're all so
comfortable so I never had problem with
Puma collections so I'm happy with this
purchase
yes I believe this is the last pair of
shoes that I have and these are and and
these are all from footlocker for Walker
calm and this is the sweet classic gold
WN oh so these are how these look like I
said I wanted to get more black shoes so
just more shoes that can wear on a
casual day rather than like an outfit so
black shoes beige shoes are just
something more casual for me so these
are the ones I got and I like this right
here so that's when you get these this
little we're here cuz I don't have any
shoes like that
I don't think so no I don't think so
so these are the last pair of Pumas that
I got and like I said I never had a
problem with Pooh
so I knew I was going to be good with
their shoes on any ones that I bought so
these are the last pair of shoes so now
that we have all these shoes out the way
on leave that was not most part that I
was like dreading going cuz it look like
so much but she's out the way now we're
gonna go to the makeup Adams that I want
so that's the most exciting part and I
think I'm gonna do the boo boo clothes
right here in a different video cuz it's
just too much stuff so yeah on to the
makeup okay so the next thing is makeup
and make them necessities so the two
places I remember ordering from with
amorphic on and also an assassin in
Beverly Hills oh my gosh anastacio had
the biggest sale that I have never seen
on makeup period and for and their
makeup to be just so high in quality
that sale was crazy it was like 10
percent of 20 30 40 50 60 and 7% on and
I know 70% off I think it was their
eyeshadow um singles like I never tried
there I sell eyeshadow singles I do have
their modern renaissance palette but
never the single so I was super happy
about that stuff I don't need any one
little tips I don't need I don't need
their concealer I don't need um actually
I didn't eat their dip brow but it was
on sale it usually runs for I think $18
but I got it for 12 hours or
oh but I got it so this oh well this is
the first thing this is morphine oh this
doesn't make a mess okay okay so the
first thing that's in here is two
pallets and I know what this is cuz this
is what I we want it so story is I got
no of course I think every makeup person
anyone who watches YouTube knows about
these so this is the morphe 35o palette
this is the shimmer and the matte one I
had the regular 3500 Kelvin I gave it to
my friend because I figured that she
could do more used to it because I
wasn't really using it and she was like
into makeup more so they had a
twenty-five percent off sale on their
site or twenty percent off I'm not sure
but um I ended up getting to these they
were in stock and why not stop the first
one this is the 35 o s I'm guessing a
shimmer
okay and this is the matte one okay so
hopefully these won't fall out please my
god okay we're good this is the shimmer
one so um I know in a 3500 regular
palette like this orange color right
here was met so being able to have that
in a shimmer color is just like heaven
so these are I mean if you haven't seen
this palette this is how it looks is
just in the shimmer and I'm going to
show you how it looks in the matte color
also in morphe it's also a very good
quality Vernon I love your shadows
have their their 35 glam palette or
multi glim something like that we'll all
the bold pretty colors in it stone I
wasn't going to be disappointed in them
and this is the Mac one so pretty these
are like the perfect colors for
transition for fall for winter for
summer this is just like the perfect
must-have palette and yeah I'm so happy
isn't it so pretty so those are the two
palettes that I got that's the only
makeup that I got from working but I did
get some other products from working
it's their brushes so I'm not sure what
the name of these brushes were but they
are the new brushes that they had on
their site they launched them on Black
Friday or Cyber Monday one of those I
don't remember but um I had to get my
hands on because I love morphe brushes I
have a couple of them right now
just a regular um brush brushes that
they have on that site but I was just so
attracted to this gold color and the
Russians are so soft so much density to
it so there's no high quality so I had
to get them and the ones that I got
looks like so I got the Murphy why 18:1
oh my god this brush is so soft and I
intentionally went on the side just to
get some transition shade brushes or and
blending brushes because I don't really
have that many blending brushes so
therefore my eye shadow isn't really
blended you know stumps I got some of
these at out I think three blending
brushes so this is one this is the Y 800
one this one is the Y 19 one and
a little more fluffier and longer and
then I have the why 15 or so this one is
a little more thicker but they're so
small and they just have so much quality
to them and they're so affordable and it
was 20% off of this and this I got this
one from my eyebrows this is the wide
same one brush and it's just oh my gosh
just this so nice I don't know why
powders coming from I don't know anyways
I got this to blend out my concealer
around my eyebrows so this is the y21
brush and these are face brushes right
here
I do not own powder brushes to remove my
powder from my face and this one is so
freakin solved this is the why three
brush and this is just to remove like
under-eye powder and just dust it where
you feel so good and I never got makeup
on it but this is this one oh this is a
buffer brush and this is for foundation
so I got this one and this one is the y7
brush and this one is not as dense as
the one I'm using now so you may be a
little less coverage which I want to see
how that's going to look so excited
about this and the last two is just a
flat top brush and this is what I'm
using for my foundation now but it's a
flat top angle brush for my foundation
so I can't wait to try this one this one
is the y6 brush by YC and I'm excited to
try this one for my foundation I'm going
to be going more makeup tutorial so I'm
glad that all this stuff came in so be
able to go for that and the last brush
is the morphe y 14 brush and this one is
for my highlighter so for my Heather
currently right now I'm using a Mac
brush similar to this but is not as
wispy so it goes on kind of harsh but it
really didn't bother my kind of finesse
it so this is gonna help me just blend
all my heart lighter so much better
alright umm cheeks and my nose and my
eyebrows and all of that stuff so I'm
happy about this one um and I've seen a
lot of youtubers say and that morphe
highlighting brushes like this was a
good purchase though heavy I got my
hands on this one and that's all I got
from Murphy now we're going to go to
Anna's fashionability
okay so on to the last makeup brand this
is my Anastasia Beverly Hills package
and their shipping was free today or
something like that so this came this
was I think this is the first package
that I got and they always package their
stuff so nicely and pretty but this
stuff is a mess all these things are
going everywhere my hardest time playing
my room oh cool okay so this is all the
stuff I got from Anastacio
like I said I did order some of their
single eyeshadows which I'm super
excited about and also with the single
eyeshadows you purchase a certain amount
you got a little contacting to put all
your own eyeshadows in my mind is like
all over the place right now this is too
much oh okay so it came with a little
date thinking like this is kind of like
a deep palette but it's has Anastacio on
it so one two three four five so it
comes with eight slots and you can just
put your eyeshadows in there so that's
super going to convenience
and it was free when you purchased um I
think for I don't know I don't know but
um I got that and then I got a couple of
days single eyeshadows the first color I
got was chocolate crumble when I tell
you these things were someone else so
fast I was literally like I had a lot in
my cart and then when I want to check
out in wouldn't let me shadow because it
was like some of these things are out of
stock now was like 12 o'clock when I got
on that site and um I don't know they
were just selling out so quickly it was
such a good bargain so I understand and
plus I've never had any of these
eyeshadows so what I did was I was on
Google and I was like typing in most
popular anastacio barely his eyeshadows
and I would look at the Z palette that
was on the images on Google and I was
like okay this one's a stock when you
get that one and this one's the stuff
let me get that so I was just like throw
another basket and it's checking out as
soon as I can
so that's what I did so these are some
of the popular ones that I was able to
get that weren't gone in three seconds
so why are they dusty okay so the first
one is chocolate crumble I'm not gonna
show you all Holly's look if you want to
see just google them this is chocolate
crumble
this one is shift on I got truffle um
star cobalt peacock aubergine noir which
is the black I'm super excited about
this one um intense gaze and the last
one is brownie and this is another nice
sight about because brownie was a
popular one that I saw and every Z
palette on Google so yeah and I'm just
going to take one out of the package
just to show you all how they look so
they just come in this little thing and
they are magnetic so you can clip them
into any detail if you have one and then
the last thing I got from Anna
she was there dipbrow
so this is the only thing when I using
my brows now because they're dipper
house are amazing I was using chocolate
at first and then when I got darker hair
I started to use
evany so um they were on sale so I
snatched them up and then when I went
back on the site the next day to see if
they were still in stock gone they were
gone so it's like yes so um like I said
I did use chocolate at me so these are
the two that I purchased again so shout
out to abh for that bond sale that was
such a big salad like it was really
worth the hassle so that's all my
bathroom any age and the little pallet
that came with it so I'm happy with a th
purchase I don't really use um my focus
that much so I didn't really need any
extra one bed but I will be trying out
there I'm single shadows that I heard
they were amazing so I'm excited about
that
and like I have three of their glow
cooks already battle me another one so
that's all for anastacio so that's all
for the makeup and shoes I will be doing
this boom hauls separately so part two
stay tuned for that if you want to see
that video check that out next cuz
that's just going to be a whole video by
its toes so thank you guys so much for
