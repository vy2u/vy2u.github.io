will be showing you all how to get these
big long curls so if you're interested
keep on watching ok as you can see one
side of my head is already done I'm
going to show you all how to do the
other side and it's not hard at all if
you just pay attention but first I'm
going to start by just combing out any
tangles then grab small sections
starting from the bottom and then I'm
going to grab small pieces from bed and
start winding okay as you can see I'm
slightly twisting the hair as I'm
wrapping it around the wine we're doing
this because if you put the hair on flat
then it's going to come out as a curl
when you take it off the barrel so when
you twist it when you release it it's
going to come out as a beautiful wave
and that's what we want for this look
okay and I'm just going to repeat this
process on this entire section of hair
as you'll see on the next row I'm going
to start curling the hair front ways and
let's just so the hair won't clump up in
all one direction and it's also going to
make your hair look so much more fuller
okay this is the part I'm going to start
curling the hair front way as you can
see I'm casing the barrel towards the
front section of the hair then wrapping
the hair towards the front I want to do
is go to entire Road in the next section
I'm going to go between curling the hair
to the back and to the front another
woman it's a concise
so don't go give away another woman to
take his eyes
another woman ticketed you spotlight so
not give away
give away my
give away another one that they can take
your spot size
everybody
get away so don't give away
I can take you spot liners
I'll give away another
you take your spots
okay now that I'm done wanting my hair
you can totally leave your hair like
this and skip this next step so because
I love big big messy hair I'm just going
to use a big wide toothed comb and comb
through all these trusts to give me the
list that I'm trying to achieve
Oh
okay this is my finished results I hope
you all enjoyed this video and found it
helpful
