first of all I want to apologize for
being gone so as you guys know for the
new year trying to have to step back
reevaluate the things that you want to
achieve in the new year so that's
exactly what I did so if I haven't been
on here that is why and I'm just
clearing that up because a lot of people
were like Chrissy where are you at
that's basically what I was doing and I
think that 31 days is more than enough
time for me to figure out what I'm
trying to do so I'm really excited for
you guys to see all the new things to
come and I'm not gonna say too much more
I'm super excited to get to this try on
haul I am partnering up what honey bum

so the first item that I tried on was
this little sweater crop top I like the
material of it just because I thought
that it was a thinner material and I
also like that it's off the shoulders
and it's also long-sleeve and I like
this little color I love like dark
colors like this I like it is really
comfortable and really think the
material is very good quality so this
was one of the items that I really liked
um the next item and I'm gonna be
totally honest with you guys in this
video just in case you guys want to buy
these items you can see how it looks on
me and how it fits me so this was the
next item that I got this one was just
something that I wouldn't wear in public
but I would wear like lounging around at
my house like Eddie
doing a hair tutorial or something so
this is how it looks on the side and on
the other side of the arm and it has
some matching shorts so this is how the
shorts look of course there is super
short on me and yeah they're like really
mini that's why I wouldn't wear these
out in public and it's like a Velvet
Touch to it this one was just like a
comfy comfy item so the next item I got
honestly I want to say this was not to
my favorites pickup and just because I
don't know it didn't look like this on
the picture when I picked it out I
thought it was leather and I don't know
it's like the colors are really pastel
looking and I really don't know what I
would wear this one I don't know what I
was thinking actually but it's the size
large it fits well but I just don't know
how I feel about this pattern I'm really
into dark solid colors so I'm not too
sure why I picked out this pattern so I
don't know yo we'll see I'll definitely
take a picture with it if I do decide to
wear this but I don't think I will but
somebody else may like it
not my favorite though the next item
that I picked I really like this one
if you guys don't follow me on snapchat
make sure you do right here I'm pretty
much always wearing a cardigan or like a
jean jacket or something of that sort so
I really love cardigans it's something
that I stack up on because you never
know when you just need to throw
something on so this was just a green
cardigan I got this in a size large just
because I wanted it to fit you know big
and long and oversized and it's a long
sleeve and I really like this material
and what I like most about it is the
bottom it's like kind of de-stress it
has these holes in it and it's really
heavy so it's really good material and I
know so many ways that I can dress this
up the next item that I got is this
green dress but this is also not so much
of my favorite this is a medium if
you're like 5:3 this would be perfect
for you because it's really really short
and as you will see
the video that it came up really really
small on me but it's the medium and I
have like a really slim frame so it's
not that it's just
unflattering it's just too small so if
it was a little longer maybe I was feel
different about it so onto skirts and
dresses this was an item that I picked
out it's just this very simple gold
skirt nothing major it's just like a
little bandage skirt is really what's
not really heavy but it's like a heavy
material is not thin or anything so the
next item is one of my favorite pieces
also this fit amazing this wasn't like
too short and also I like that it's like
that leather material has like these
little holes on the side and it gives
like that very nice detail and it also
zips up in the back and this is a size
medium um I really like this as you guys
can see I really like neutral colors
nudes solid colors so that pattern was
just not cutting it working but I really
like this item and I definitely know how
I want to dress this up so that was one
of my favorites also okay so this is the
last item this is absolutely my favorite
pick up so it's just this white dress
once again this is super heavy and I
think this because of these this arm
piece y'all this just looks so good on I
could just like see this with a red lip
or even like a nude lip slick tile Pony
or just like some bone straight here or
like a bob or even like a topknot button
this was a size medium I feel like a
small would have been too small but
these arms are super cute I think it's
so classy this could be either really
casual or you can even dress this up but
this is super cute it can go either way
and that's what I love that basically
concludes all the things that I picked
up from honey boom um I want to check
out more of
there are other clothes that they have
on that side I had to choose from a
selection to show you guys this haul I
also want to like see what other items
they have just in case
I plan on ordering from there again
which I do believe I will but like I
said I was being very honest um some I
think it was like only three pieces that
wasn't too flattering on me but I'm
gonna let you guys decide and see how
you like it on me and also how you think
it will look on you if you decide to get
these items yeah that's basically all I
