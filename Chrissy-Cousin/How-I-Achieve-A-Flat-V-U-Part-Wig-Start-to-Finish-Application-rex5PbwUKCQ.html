so today's video is going to be on how I
lay and apply my wigs from start to
finish so if you all are interested in
seeing how I do sell just keep on
watching ok so the first thing of course
I'm going to do is blow dry my hair as
straight as I can get it and I'm using
my con hair flat-ironed all of that will
be linked in the description box below
so check that out and I just try to get
it as smooth as possible just to have it
smooth and flat and all that stuff and
then I go into making my part this will
be a middle V part wig
so I'm parting my hair and how much you
leave out I want and then we're going to
get to braiding so then you're going to
start the braiding process and I just
want to mention beforehand that I am NOT
a breeder I'm not a pro grader this is
just my method I learned from just
constantly just braiding my hair for my
you parts and it just got better over
time
but sometimes I still don't know what
I'm doing but it's working and it's flat
and tight so I'm sticking with this but
as you can see this is my anchor braid
this is what my wig will be holding on
to so I just want to make it as neat and
flat as possible because this is the
base for my weight and I just want you
all to see how I'm going to do this
right here so I'm going to connect the
first braid and merge it into the second
braid just so it can have a flat base so
instead of just showing multiple braids
down I'm just going to connect the
previous one to the next one so as you
can see I put the first braid into and
linked it with the second one and then
just continue braiding like you did the
first one and then just continue to join
that on this half of your head so once
you go to the next braid you're going to
get the tail from this braid and just
link it with that one and then the next
one you're going to link it again
and that's just going to give you a flat
base and that's the easiest thing that I
can think of right now and it's working
for me so that's just what I go with it
as you can see this is the finished
result and this is one half of my head
I'm going to do the exact same thing to
the other side okay so as you can see
this is the finished result of both
sides of my head and as you can see
there are two tails so now I'm going to
show you how to sew it down and you can
use a black or brown thread I chose to
use Brown this time and a curved needle
and this part is super easy as you can
see all I did was flip that first tail
to the opposite side of my head and it's
just when I make it super flat and I sew
it tightly down just making sure it's
secure and then I'm gonna just keep
sewing upwards until you see that little
part sticking up is sewn flat down and
then I'm just going to do the exact same
thing to the other side it's pretty much
self-explanatory if you just watch what
I'm doing it's not hard at all so I'm
just going to let you all watch and see
how I do this and then you can get a
general idea
you
and another way to just get your bass
superflat just make sure that you're
pulling that brain super tight on the
other side of your head to slow it down
because if you slow it down
loosely it's going to be lumpy and then
when you apply your wig it's going to
have like bumps in the back and your
nape area you don't want that you want
it to lay as flat as possible and this
is the finished result it's super flat
it's laying so well I actually love this
method better than the tiny tiny braids
because it's easy to take out also but
as you can see my hair is brown right
here so yeah I'm just going to show you
all that I did dye my leave out black
and this is the wig I just cut all of
the extra mesh cap off just to get it to
fit perfectly on my head and you see how
perfectly my wig just fits so nicely and
snug on my head like it's just a perfect
fit and look how flat it is so now we're
going to sew the wig onto our base
braids and you're going to sew it
through the cap and make sure that it
goes into the braid under the cap to
just make sure it's super secure and
your wig won't go anywhere and also be
sure to secure your first time going
through the wig into the braid with a
knot and you're just going to keep doing
that onto the other side and just comb
out any flyaways so it won't get caught
into your thread and you will have a
flat surface throughout the entire thing
and this part is also self-explanatory
so you can just see how I do this and I
forgot to mention that I am pulling the
needle through the thread so when
there's a hole right here as you can see
I'm pulling it through that hole and it
just gives it an extra look and also
extra security so your wig won't go
anywhere
and once we're done sewing the top part
we're just going to show these edges
down and we're going to do this the
exact same way but I'm just not going to
sew it as close like I did at the top
because it's already pretty secure I
just want to make sure that in case the
wind blows you won't be able to see my
braids so I'm just sewing this down flat
also and by that anchor braid being
super tiny in the front it makes it
super flat as possible and that's what I
love about this technique and just
continue doing this until you reach the
back of your hair and then just cut the
ends of all the loose thread that you
have back there and then you're going to
see the end result of this process
and as you can see now we're finished
with the installation process and now
we're just going to blend my natural
hair with weave so I want to use my Qi
iron and I want to use the chase method
this is the only way I can get my
natural hair super straight and the only
thing I put in my nature here was cheese
keratin silk infusion in this stuff is
just the bomb it works wonders it makes
my hair so silky and it blends perfectly
with the weave you all will see that in
the end and as you can see it just looks
so flawless I just love it so much so
I'm just going to do that to one side of
my head and then I'm going to brush it
down and press it down just to make sure
lays flat and you can see the difference
from side to side and then I'm going to
do the exact same thing to the other
side
okay and now back to the lead
so now we're going to try to get this
hair as bonus tree as possible as you
can see is super fluffy and has so much
luster which I love but it's not going
to work with bone straight leave out in
this big poof ball here so I want to do
the exact same thing and I want to use
the chase method I don't have any type
of product in this hair all I did to the
hair was wash and condition it with my
Aussie seven and one conditioner and in
the Aussie moist shampoo so that's all I
did to the hair no product whatsoever so
it's super weightless is not there's no
product to wait a hair down that's how I
like my hair because once you start
putting product in it starts getting
crazy and just sticky and dirty and I
don't have the time for that
so no product is the way for me for now
so it's working and I'm just going to
continue doing that throughout my entire
head and just get it as straight as
possible with one to two passes and you
will see the results of that and I kind
of just wanted to sneak in how I bone
straight my hair in this video but if
you all want a more in-depth video um
just on the flat iron my hair bone
straight just let me know in the comment
section below and as you can see this is
the result I got from just chasing it
with the flat iron and brush what's the
one to two passes
and it's so pretty I absolutely love it
and here I'm showing you how I flamed my
face with some layers I am NOT a pro at
all I just kind of chopped up a lot of
people were asking me in my previous
video was that the length of the hair or
was it layers that I cut in as you can
see it is layers and you can enough see
the difference and also I wanted to kind
of give it more of a blunt cut I didn't
want the straight ends at the bottom so
I also trimmed the ends of the hair and
this right here is the wonder product in
this video to kind of help my natural
hair have a little bit more longevity to
last with the leave a little better and
just to have it blend and have that
silky finish and then I'm just going to
go back with my chi horn and flatten
that out to give it just a flawless
finish and just be sure to comb
everything together just to make sure
everything blends and has the same looks
and then you will have this when this
was my finishing look it was super easy
this is my routine when I want to
straighten my weave um if you all have
any questions or concerns leave it in
the comment section below or you can ask
me on Twitter and snapchat thank you all
