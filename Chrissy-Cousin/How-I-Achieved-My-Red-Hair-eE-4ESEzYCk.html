hey toes and welcome back to my channel
so today's video is just going to be
another hair review but this hair review
is just a tidbit different from the
other ones so this is not an Aliexpress
hair vendor I know I did the Aliexpress
hair holes in my past videos but this is
not an Aliexpress vendor the name of
this company is called Bella a more hair
I am reviewing their malaysian straight
hair these are floral bundles and these
are the inches 18 20 22 and 24 as you
can see I am a different color
and I just probably new to you guys but
I am now a magenta redhead all I did to
achieve this color was use magenta and
fuchsia by a door and also a box die by
Revlon and I will have all of that link
in the description box below and I will
also have a small clip of how I achieved
this color at the end of this video so
if you just want to see a little snippet
of how I got the color is not really um
in-depth but it just gives you a general
idea of just how our cheese is covered
so it came out perfectly exactly how I
wanted it I'm super pleased with how the
texture of the hair still is it's not
dry this has got to be the best straight
hair that I have ever tried
I know previously I tried the VIP Beauty
hair from Aliexpress and you can
definitely tell the difference in the
texture with the hair I couldn't really
get the L Express VIP fare to straighten
this well but this hair had no problem
straight
even after I bleached it to get it to
get the base color for my red hair the
hair didn't dry up at aw it stayed super
soft and silky and that's what I
absolutely love about it I didn't use
any product in this hair but the cheek
keratin silk infusion and this is what I
put on my leave out and I just rub it
through the hair and it makes things
super shiny this is all I do with it I
get a little in my hand I love it
together and I just put it on my leave
out like this and then just rub the rest
through the hair and it leaves it super
silky and shiny and healthy looking and
the ends are super bone straight and
sleek I literally cannot stop running my
hands for this hair it's super beautiful
and I'm in love with it so far so I
install this hair on June 16 exactly and
today is June 24th so I had it for about
eight days and I have no complaints
about this hair whatsoever so far I am
totally in love with it this is a V part
it is a side apart what literally the
smallest weave out you can imagine my
leave out is super small just to prevent
my hair from being heat damaged so even
though this was four bundles of straight
hair I thought I was going to be able to
pick all of this here on the wig cap but
I have so much hair left over I was so
surprised this is
the I think this is the 2024 inch you
know this is the 22 inch this is all the
hair I have left and this is the I think
this is the 20 inch that I have lived no
this is the 18 inch that I have left so
I was surprised about how much hair I
had left my hair is still full what
about and 3/4 of the bundles so I'm
really happy about that
another thing out absolutely love about
this hair you know I always tell you up
the hair shed your knob but this hair
literally does not like if it's not
me waking up and just detangling my hair
and make it like 1 2 3 strands but if
I'm just calming my hair just on a daily
I literally get no strands in this brush
and that's just their webs or
constructed super well I don't I don't
know the difference between L Express
vendors and other vendors but this hair
does not have problem with and
then by my hair being red I'm able to
tell easily if hairs on the ground or if
it's on a white sink has the most
minimal shedding that I have ever
experienced and it's just so worth the
price
look how musters it is like
and I used my Chi to achieve this look a
lot of people ask me to curl the
straight hair just to see if it holds a
curl well and I will be doing this with
this hair I will be making a full out
tutorial on how I'm going to experiment
and curl with this here and you see how
well the curl back because this hair is
very much the bone straight than the
other hand I reviewed but the other hair
did for the curl I don't know if it was
because it was more luxurious or not but
I will test this out and you all will be
able to see how that holds so I will
have all the information for this hair
linked in the description box below you
all know that already all the
information what products I use what I
use to straighten it the color that is
in my head and also this company was so
sweet enough to send me a discount code
for you also you can get some cash off
of your purchase the discount code will
be in the description box also but it
will be right here also the code is
Crissy chri ssy and yeah you can just
get some money off of your purchase if
you get the exact inches that I got I
think you'll be like 25 or 27 dollars
all which is better than anything so
once again this is Bella or more
here this is their malaysian straight in
the inches 18 20 22 and 20 or if you all
have any questions about the hair or
about anything else you can let me know
in the comment section or you can snap

this is how the hair looks standing up
the 24 inches comes to my lace I'm about
five eight and a half five nine so that
is where it stops
but yes that's basically all I have to
say about this hair once again

so thank you all so much for watching
don't forget to Like comment and
subscribe and I will see you all in my
next video bye so to achieve this color
it was super easy all I got was four
boxes of a Revlon's color so die in the
color burgundy 48 and it was like three
dollars and then I got three bottles of
a door which I only ended up using just
two colors and the colors I used was
magenta and yes the fuchsia and I
intentionally wanted to get rich fuchsia
but this is the color I accidentally
picked and it came out perfectly and all
you see me doing here is squeezing the
exact amount of color in each little
small container that I have here and
pouring that into the mixing bowls so
I'm doing this so one mixing bowl will
be for two bundles of hair and the other
mixing bowl will be for the other two
bundles of hair so I'm just making sure
that each of the bundles come out the
exact same color as the other ones
so yeah this just helped me manage the
amount of lint that I put into each
mixing bowl and just to make sure that
everything just comes out looking smooth
and perfected and all that stuff and
then we're just going to mix that up and
we're going to start applying and there
was no special way that I applied this
rinse um I started from the ends and
then just worked my way up to the half
section and then just went up a little
bit more so about 3/4 of the bundle was
covered with the rinse and then I'm
going to go in with the dye
on the rest of the bundle so just so we
can have a gradient effect and if you're
wondering how I got my hair to get this
blonde color I do have a tutorial on how
I um braid my hair before but it's a bit
different this time because this time I
just splattered all of the bleach
mixture onto the hair at once I didn't
ombre it but you can if you want you
want to get it at a more gradient
looking color but no this time I just
mixed up the bleach developer and just
put it on the entire bundle and it just
died the exact same color at the same
speed so nothing really special so yeah
I was really easy so now we're going to
go in with the box dye and it has a
little cream developer and you have to
pour the mixture into the container and
just shake it up make sure everything is
well mixed together and then you just
spread that on top of your bundles and
I'm going to spread that out with the
brush just make sure I get in there
really good make sure no blonde spots or
visible because we don't want red hair
in blond spots and it just looks patchy
and ugly so you just want to make sure
you get all into hairs in the middle and
do all the type of flipping that you
need just to make sure you get
everything covered
and then just comb through it and make
sure everything is well distributed and
to the exact same thing to the other
side and the inside of the bundle also
and I didn't want my entire hedge
fuchsia and magenta so this burgundy
color just gives it just a very
beautiful gradient effect from dark to a
lighter you know magenta reddish color
and then I'm going back in with our
rinse and just cover any spots that I
think would be visible with the blonde
and just correct that make sure
everything is covered and then we're
going to cover that with a plastic bag
and then repeat the same thing to the
other three bundles of hair
and I let this color sit on my hair for
about an hour and a half so an hour and
a half for all four bundles at the least
amount of time I did not want to start
this process all over so I just let it
sit sit sit in just get all of that
color in there still after all that I
rinsed all of that color out and I
conditioned my hair with the Aussie
moist conditioner and this is the color
that I came up with after I blow dried
it and straightened it with my cheap
flat iron it was super easy and I had so
much fun creating this look but you all
know if you have any questions or
concerns you can ask me in the comment
section below or on Twitter and snapchat
