pins of course my closure and a
Styrofoam head and this was my first
time ever plucking a lace frontals so
this is not a tutorial this is just a
video of me showing you all how I went
about experimenting with this frontal so
as you can see the hairs are super thick
the hairline looks super and natural and
we don't want that on our head because
the frontal will look like just a
full-blown cartoon wait so I'm just
going to try to pluck these hairs and
just try to get the hair lines with a
bit natural so the first thing I needed
was some good tweezers I cannot use any
bad tweezers these has to be new and
super sturdy and as you can see I'm kind
of Harding just the front of the hair
where the shorter hairs are and just
getting that out of the way so I'm gonna
keep it real with y'all and this is
honestly where I went wrong I'm pulling
the hair out with my hands and it had me
what little tiny bald spots in the end
that I could have avoided if I just kept
tweezing the hair I was trying to take
the easy and quickest way out and this
was the result that I ended up doing but
it didn't end up looking bad at all I
was able to cover it up with my baby
hairs and all of that but you know
everybody is different I just should
just thank you all just keep tweezing
and don't blow the hair unless you have
a light hand and you can pull out fewer
hairs just do your thing but in my
opinion I wouldn't do it again and I'm
selling all this because I want you all
to learn from my experience
and just not take out too much here and
if you're wondering how I've reached the
knots on my friends we'll just check the
description box below I have a video on
how I've reached all of my closures so
just check that out is the exact same
way it's just doing it on the front zone
as you can see the difference already
where the hair isn't just going straight
across the hairline it has some zigzags
and just you can see how it's kind of
fading from light to dark and I'm going
to just keep doing that until I get the
results that I'm looking for and it's
not any specific way I'm plucking the
hair I'm literally just trying to thin
out that front so as you can see I'm
just plucking random places all right so
I'm not going to talk to the rest of
this video just continue plucking the
hair with the tweezers all the places
where you see me pulling the hair out
with my hand just disregard that unless
you have a very white hand and you can
pull out fewer hairs then keep doing you
you know do you think but other than
that just keep plucking the hair in your
frontal will be slayed so I'm gonna stop
talking and you can just see my
demonstration
you
Oh
so this was my final result you all if
you all want to see how I ended up
making the full wig out of this frontal
stay tuned for the next video and also
if you want to see how I installed my
wig installed it stay tuned for the
video after that so thank you all so
