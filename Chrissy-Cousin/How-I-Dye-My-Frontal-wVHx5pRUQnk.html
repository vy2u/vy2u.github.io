I'm so happy to be back on here for the
new year um I know it's kind of been a
minute but I literally just had to sink
in that it's 2017 which is still crazy
and I'm super excited because 2017 is
going to bring great things I already
know I'm speaking it into existence so I
hope that for myself and for you all but
I'm still happy that she lost stuck with
me to 2017 and I'm so happy for
everything to come and another exciting
thing before I get into this hair is
that we're almost to 100,000 subscribers
like that's super crazy to me I was
excited just this time last year for
reaching 1,000 subscribers so it's crazy
that we're almost to 100,000 in a year
like that's so crazy oh my gosh so yeah
that's basically all I had to say I hope
you all are having a wonderful new year
so far and yeah let's just keep these
videos coming and consistent so now
we're going to get straight into the
review okay so I've been getting a lot
of questions on my snapchat about this
hair so this is the hair that I had and
for my birthday on my snapchat a lot of
people was asking me was that the virgle
hair that I previously reviewed on my
channel and no this is not virgle hair
this is another L Express vendor and
their name is ally grace and you've
probably heard about them on on YouTube
I know I have and I've heard nothing but
great things about this hair and
honestly it is living up to what
everyone else has been saying so I did I
just hear the exact same color that I
did on my other hair I just went further
up to the west of the hair to get the
color to be more of a burgundy rather
than a burgundy ombre on my other um wig
that I did with the virgle hair so yeah
let's just get into the specs on this
hair I know you all are wondering so
like I said this is Ellie grace from
aliexpress this is their Brazilian
straight texture and I want to back up
so y'all can see but this is the
straight texture and
this is in the inches 22 24 26 26 and a
lace-front oh so I did bleach the knots
on the lace frontal all that jazz and I
also plucked the lace front oh so it
looks super natural and another
surprising thing about this hair is that
I only use two bundles like that's crazy
to me I only use two bundles in the
front so and it looks amazing like it's
super full
I love the density of it by being
straight hair and me knowing that I
wanted to wear it straight I do want the
density of the hair to not be heavy like
my other um reviews so I only went with
two bundles and I actually like how it
looks um it straightens very well after
I washed and conditioned it and after
air dried it and it went back bone
straight light like I never even did
anything to it
so I love how we took the color and has
any problems taking the color and also
if you all want let's a story on how I
got this color make sure you stay tuned
to the end of this video because I will
be having a mini tutorial on how I got
this color if you I had to watch my
previous video on the virgle hair and I
also give you just a little tutorial on
how I colored my lace frontal if they
come in a lot of hair on the lace
frontal um like some other le spreads
vendors I know for sure that Virgo hair
did come pre plug which was a major plus
for people who really don't know how to
plug their frontals but I did have to
plug this one and make it look a little
more natural on the hairline but I
freaking love this front so like it has
the perfect amount of hair on it like
throughout the back and everything and
it's just amazing I love it so if you
all are wondering would I shampooed and
conditioned this hair with of course you
all know that I only wash my hair with
all C products so I use the Aussie
moistu ampoule and conditioner but after
my birthday I did wash this wig again
and I did use the Aussie moist shampoo
so yeah it looks beautiful to me like I
absolutely love this hair I wanted
something different and longer for my
birthday so that's why I put this here
and indite it but I will be showing you
all more tutorials
the Virgo hair so don't think I just
threw that away my sister's actually
wearing it and she could get more of a
feel and like a good review on it rather
than me trying to do this in that so if
she has any problems with it of course
she's gonna come here and let you all
know with me featured you know so the
only two bundles that I used was the 26
and the 24 so the 22 bundle and the
other 26 bundle I didn't use so yeah if
you all were just wondering about which
two bundles I use and I'm just loving
this hair so far like it's amazing and
if you're wondering how the frontal
looks parted I don't have any glue on
this hair or anything it's just the
elastic band method so you can just part
it anywhere and it just looks super
natural of it so another thing I love
about this hair that is very minimal
shedding I really cut the UM wefts on
this trick only at the top where my lace
frontally just so that you know the lace
front so it looks as flat as possible
because we don't want lumps over there
that was the mistake that I made on my
first lace frontal yeah it was just a
mess I was double weft in it and just
doing any kind of way brushing and it
wasn't leaning slash so I learned my
lesson and I didn't see like um this is
me just straight and it's super flat
like you can't even tell so that's
another thing that I learned my lesson
from but I'm loving this hair so far if
anything changes of course I'm going to
let you all know all of the links will
be in the description box below so you
can check out this vendor and also their
bundle deals so make sure you click
those links below just so you can find
out as much information as you can and
also if you want to purchase it before I
final review it so oh I would suggest is
no more than three bundles unless you
just want a really really full wig which
I really don't recommend it's too much
hair so two bundles did for me
three bundles is more than enough for
you they say yeah that's basically all I
have to say about this hair if y'all
have any questions comments or concerns
just let me know in the comment section
below and if you want to see me do any
kind of styling with this hair just let
me know also so thank you all so much
for watching this video stay tuned to
the end to see my mini tutorial and I
want to thank y'all so much for watching
once again have a wonderful new 2017
year and I will see you all in the next
video hi guys
okay so for those wondering how I color
my frontal it's very easy and what I
really do is just apply as much dye as I
can towards the bottom of the hair and
then I'm just going to brush the rest at
the top so I do this technique just to
avoid me getting any kind of color onto
my lace it's a very tedious job but I
mean it works for me um I don't really
know how to explain it much better than
this and for you all to really see the
visual how I'll do it but you're going
to see me part the hair also if you want
to get to like the middle spots you're
gonna see me heart some of the sections
in the hair and then just go ahead and
brush the rest of the dye through and by
me brushing the dye through it's getting
it's picking up the dye from the bottom
of the hair and just bringing it to the
top and this brush I'll have a link for
it in the description box below I always
talk about this brush it's like six
dollars from Amazon seven dollars
something like that but I just apply it
to the hair and brush through it it's
gonna give me kind of a highlighted
effect is not gonna bring that color
straight straight straight to the root
but it gets as close as I could have
gotten without me getting it onto the
lace so yeah that's really how that I do
and also I also should suggest that you
all leave the lace part at the front of
your lace just so you can kind of pick
it up if you have to instead of cutting
it and having to touch the lace and as
you can see I don't have any color on my
lace but yeah I just follow this and you
should get the exact same results
and another thing I want to mention
about this brush is that it's just not
any regular brush the bristles on this
brush is long and summer short so it
really allows you to get as close as you
can to the lace and it doesn't touch it
so yeah this is really why I use this
brush if I would have used another brush
I know how it turned out you can try it
but this works for me and if you want to
die you're from Seoul then and work
through also so that's basically my
quick technique on how I do this is
super simple and if you have any further
questions just let me know in the
comment section below someone else may
have the same question and I'll try to
get back to you and yeah let that sit
for an hour and these remind result
so this will conclude my mini tutorial
hopefully off on this video super
helpful you learn something new

questions just leave it in the comment
