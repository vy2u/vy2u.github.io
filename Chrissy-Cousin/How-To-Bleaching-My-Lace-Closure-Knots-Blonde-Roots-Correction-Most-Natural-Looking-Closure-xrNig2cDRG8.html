channel so today's video is just going
to be a quick tutorial on how I bleach
you're not on my lace closure so as you
can see you can see those black dots on
the closure and we do not want that on
our head because it's not natural
looking at all so I just want to show
you all how to get the perfect enclosure
to match your scalp so if you are
interested in seeing how I get this look
keep on watching okay so of course the
first thing you're going to need is your
closure and then I'm going to get my
powder bleach and then I'm going to use
a 30 developer just so it won't be too
intense and then I need a dyeing brush
some for you just to cover the dye in a
small mixing bowl so if you purchase the
bleach in this container like this which
is from my beauty supply store for like
eight dollars it comes with its blue
measuring cup and I just filled this
measuring cup up just about halfway and
pour that into my small mixing Cup and
now as you can see is not a lot at all
especially for lace closure you do not
need too much product in to get your
knots bleach and then I'm just going to
add a full cup of developer and pour
that in there and we're just going to
mix that all together and as you can see
soon I'm going to add a little bit more
developer just to loosen that up a
little and this is the consistency you
want not too loose and not too runny now
to get these knots bleached you want to
start applying a small thin layer onto
the lace and you don't want to go too
thick on the lace because you don't want
it to sink through and start just dying
the roots of your hair because if you
cry too much at once and push it in it's
going to leave your roots looking ashy
and blonde and we don't really want that
but that does happen sometimes and I
have a method to resolve that so don't
worry if it happens but you just want to
start applying a small coat and as you
can see I started from the middle
and then I'm just starting to spread it
out throughout the entire closure okay
so I actually forgot I didn't put this
on inside a closure but if you do plan
on switching between side and middle
parts bleach the entire thing but since
I just plan on leaving it just on the
middle part
I just bleach these areas okay so once I
felt like I've reached the areas that I
wanted this is how it should look and
now I'm just going to lay that flat down
on some aluminum foil and now you're
just going to see me part where I want
my exact middle part and this is just
going to help me define where the bleach
is going and now you see me just
pressing the hair gently down just to
make sure all that bleach gets on the
knots and I'm just going to cover that
up and let it sit and get bleached okay
so this is about 1518 minutes later and
I take that for you off and as you can
see right here the knots or bleach which
is great but as you can see right here
it kind of sunk through and got on the
roots of the hair so now we're freaking
out because now we have black hair and
blonde roots and you do not want that so
of course we have to correct it and to
correct that I'm going to be using an
azure prince and I would actually prefer
to use a black dye but I didn't have
died at the time so I use what I have
and yeah so I'm gonna use my ELF three
and one mascara brush with no mascara on
it I wiped everything off and dip that
lightly into the rinse and just go as
close as I can to this lace and get
these blonde roots out because we cannot
have black hair and blonde roots so this
brush made it super easy to just get as
close I can and correct that mistake
because yeah just thank God for this
method because it helps perfectly and
just be sure to be careful not to get
the dye on the lace because that can
just cause more problems that we do not
need so be careful and tedious and just
take your time take your time let it sit
for 10 to 15 minutes and we're going to
rinse that out and have your finished
result
and this will be your finished result as
you can see that's a big difference but
