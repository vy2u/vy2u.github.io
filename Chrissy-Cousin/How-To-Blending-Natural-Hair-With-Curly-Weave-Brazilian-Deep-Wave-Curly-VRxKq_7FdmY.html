and welcome back to my channel so
today's video is just going to be a
quick detailed tutorial on how I blend
my natural leave out with my curly hair
a lot of people was asking me and
emailing me asking me how I blend my
natural hair with curly weed and asking
me how it looks so natural so I just
wanted to get a um as detailed as I can
tutorial on how to do so the tutorial
will be very easy like it's a beginner
friendly I only used four flexi rods gel
water and conditioner so it's not really
anything that you need to buy but it's
everything that you should have in your
house and yeah if you want to see how to
lay your leave out girl just keep on
watching okay so what we have here is
just the hair washed conditioned and air
dried for a full day so these are the
curls that you will get if you just wash
and condition your hair and I just let
it air dry so I just wanted to show you
all exactly how those curls are popping
and how they look and it's really flat
right now but yeah we're going to fluff
that out after okay so of course the
first thing you want to do is wash and
condition your leave out this is just
some of that Aussie moist conditioner
still in there and then I'm just going
to rinse all of that out and this is my
natural curl pattern it's really like
everywhere is not defined I wish I was
able to wear my natural curl pattern
with wavy hair but Sally it is just heat
damaged and color damaged and all that
so I just have to settle for the flexi
rods now but as you can see right now
all I'm doing is parting I leave out how
I want it to lay and all that and
combing it out just making sure
everything is tangle free and then we're
going to start dividing our hair to put
the flexi rods in
okay so the first thing you want to do
is take a piece of your leave out and
you're going to divide that from one
side of your head and then right here
I'm just showing you how much hair I'm
actually taking from the you part way so
I'm going to put those two pieces
together and I'm going to wrap that
around the flexi rod but the key to get
it to blend is to wrap it around and
twist it while doing so
so you're wrapping it twisting it
twisting it wrapping it twisting it and
yeah so you're just going to continue
doing that until you're finished with
that section of hair and you're just
going to bend your flexi rod after just
to make sure it stays in place and
depending on how many flexi rods you
want to use in your hair I personally
choose to use just four but depending on
how many you want to use just continue
doing this throughout all those sections
it's super easy so yeah just keep doing
that
okay so now that we're done with all of
our sections we just want to get some
eco styler gel and a old toothbrush and
brush your baby carrots out make the
style you want this is how I choose to
do mine and then after we get our
desired look I take a minute to get my
perfect but yeah once you get your
desired look you just want to get a
cotton hair scarf and wrap that around a
baby hairs and make sure they're laid
for in the morning and this hair is
super big so I had to get a bigger
bonnet so I just put my hair up like
this and go to sleep so we'll see how
that looks in the morning okay so this
is about eight hours later and as you
can see when I take my hair scarf all
those baby hairs are not going anywhere
so those early and all you want to do
now is to is unravel all of those flexi
rods I don't use any type of coconut oil
or anything no product at all I don't
want to weigh down my hair so I just
unravel them no product and yeah we're
going to blend on later
so once all the flexi rods are out and
everything is unraveled all you want to
do is just pull apart those ways and
just try to blend it in as good as
possible what you want to do is get your
real hair and tuck it in the air like
I'm doing right here and you just want
to play around with it until you get
your desired look but this is basically
all I did as you can see the hair is
super super flat now if you watch my
previous video it was super big but it's
flat because I just washed it and air
dried it later on during the day it got
bigger but this is how it looks now yeah
I really hope you all enjoyed this video
