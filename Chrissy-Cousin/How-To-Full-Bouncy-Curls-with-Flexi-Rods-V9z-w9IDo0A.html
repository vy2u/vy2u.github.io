channel so today's video will be a
full-out tutorial on how I should be big
bombshell Victoria's Secret ish curls
well that's what I like to call it but I
have a video on how I got bistros once
before but the hair was much shorter and
this hair is longer so this is just an
updated routine so if you guys are
interested and seeing just keep on
watching
so the first thing of course is you want
to comb out your hair and this is Bella
amorous Malaysian straight hair and I'm
using this ACD brush I will have
everything in the description box below
so check that out in this brush just
take all the tangles out flawlessly I
love it so much but the links of the
hair will also be in the description box
so check that out okay so the curling
iron I will be using is a Conyers Hot
Tools curling iron and I got into
Walmart like 3-4 years ago it's super
old but if you join the job for me so
I'm going to continue to use it until it
stops working but to get these curls you
want to throw your hair back ways and if
you want to get a more detailed tutorial
on this I will have the video of my
other flexi rod set on shorter hair in
the description box so if you want to
just learn more about it just check that
out but yeah I throw my curls back ways
and once you get that girl I'm going to
show you all how to apply it on the
flexi rod and it's a major key that you
apply this curl on the flexi rod
perfectly so you can get that perfect
curl and this is a flexi rod grams
Cardiel and i'm using a medium sized one
and just pay attention to what I'm doing
so I bring the Flex lot as far as down
as I can and then I just leave a little
hair at the end and wrap that around
until the tail is not visible anymore
I'm going to try to explain this as easy
as possible so as you can see the tail
is gone but now we want to get this part
right here
and curl it into that to make sure that
that tail is not going anywhere so it's
locked in as you can see so when you
take that flexing right down the trail
is going to be perfect your ends will
not be straight because you got all of
that here on to the flexi rod and
everything will be curled so that is
what we're going to do so the entire
head I'm going to do this one more time
so you all can and just see and get a
better visual but it's super easy you
just want to make sure that that tail of
the hair is locked in the flexi rod so
you can have the perfect curl
so watch me do it again and y'all just
ignore my edges that's not the point of
the video but we're just going to ignore
those inches
worry about the flexi rod I'm going to
take care that and begin so yeah they'll
do the exact same thing to another piece
of your hair and watch me with the flexi
rod again I'm going to use a different
color these are all the colors that came
in the package I'm just randomly using
them so bring it down as far as possible
as far as your arm can reach and wrap
wrap wrap how many times until that tail
is not visible and then get it and wrap
it into the rest of the hair and as you
can see it's locked in not going
anywhere and you will have your other
perfect curl so I'm going to speed this
other segments up so it will be boring
and me just talking so you guys get the
general idea I'm doing it so you all can
just see how I do the rest of my hair
just add tension in you'll have those
bomb curls
okay so I finished with the left side of
my head these are just random just
pieces of hair that I picked up in
sections and just curled but I did to
buy my hair in half
just to manage the left side from the
right side but just couple random
sections curl and flexi rod and you look
at this
exactly
so now that we're done with the flex
rocks that we are going to lay these
edges and I will be using the eco styler
gel and this is the argan oil type and I
don't really know how to explain how I
lay my baby hairs I get a lot of
questions and this is just a visual how
I do it since I don't know how to
explain it that well I'm going to slow
this down for you all so you all can
just get a general idea so just try to
pay attention and see how I do it but
I'm always changing up it's not a
routine that I do and I just took so
long on this process if I wanted a
different shape I just kept changing
them over and over but I was satisfied
in the end and that was the result that
I got but the eco styler gel works well
I wouldn't use gorillas it's not but it
just flakes up my hair so bad so maybe
on a good day I would decide to use it
but eco styler gel does the job for now
and if you're watching this please in
the comment section below let me know
what you lay your edges down with
because I want to try something new and
something that will have them lay all
day beside the gorillas not in jail so
leave a comment below and tell me what
you all use and what works for you and
now we're going to cover your edges with
a hair scarf I would rather use a set in
or silk scarf this is cotton kind of
dried them out in the morning but that
was all I had and then put your bonnet
on and this will be the morning the next
morning and just take all of those
flecks right down and then we're going
to go into the best part the most fun
part of process and we're going to comb
those babies out and you're going to
have your finished result
and these will be the result of the
curls when you take all the flexi rods
out as you can see everything is coiled
perfectly believe your hair like this if
you want but no no that's not how I like
my hair we're about to comb this out and
make it big and she is super huge and
yeah just comb it out to your desire and
until you get the look that you want I'm
just gonna keep combing koni koni with a
white with comb and look at those curls
love like just look how everything just
comes together
during the winter
and to help lay and blend my leave out a
little better I will be using the chi
keratin so confusing and I live by this
stuff it really does what the name says
it's super lightweight and silky on the
hair and it just makes your real hair
and extensions feel so luxurious and I
don't like to put product in my
extensions with this stuff
change the game seriously and I also
love it because when I applied to my
real hair I realized that my hair does
not result have as much as it would if I
would use another serum or another
product so and this is my finished
result I really hope you all found this
tutorial super easy and helpful this is
my go-to style when I want big bombshell
curls but once again thank you all for

support and love I love you all so much

next video bye guys
