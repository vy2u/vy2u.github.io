and welcome back to my channel so
today's video is going to be a
start-to-finish tutorial on how I get
this exact something's in my life it
also welcome back to my channel so
today's video is going to be a full-out
tutorial on how I apply my lace closure
units from beginning to end literally so
I'm going to show you how I style my
hair under the lid how I style my wig
from it being air dries to these
beautiful bouncy voluminous curls and
then I'm going to show you all how to
apply onto your head but just background
on the tear this is Perla Tara from
Aliexpress if you all want to see my
first gloss on this hair I will have
that video linked in the description box
below so if you want to see how the tail
looks straight just check out that video
and also what I firstly thought about it
and also if you want to see how I made
this exact wig from start to finish I
will have that in the description box
below also so umm like I said this video
will be showing you all how I got these
big curls and I already have two videos
on my channel already on how I get big
curls with a curling iron and flexi rod
so if you want to see that on different
texture type hair and also different Lin
hair just check that out of course or
the in the description box below but
this is the third video but I think this
one came out the best let me know what
you all think which flexi my video was
lost favorite I think this one came out
the best I want to talk too much in the
beginning of this video I want to get
straight into it but don't forget to
like this video if you did enjoy it and
found it helpful and also comment and
subscribe
some once again thank you all so much
for everything if you want to see how I
achieve this look just keep on watching
and let's get straight into the video
hey Dallas okay so I'm starting off with
freshly washed and conditioned hair and
I'm just patting away the rest of that
dampness with an oversized t-shirt and
now I'm applying my weight and you're
going to see that this hair is all over
the place you do not want to go out
looking like this so we're going to get
this late
and I'm just putting this part into my
hair and I'm going to make this into a
side part style but I'm just parting it
straight down the middle and this hair
is air-dry it by the way just to put
that out there so um the key to having a
lathe lace closure unit is to flatten
out the hair so what I'm doing right
here is showing you all I'm using this
very big hot tool and I'm just pressing
it against the lace to make sure that
all of those flyaways are going to be
super flat and not noticeable so that is
a major key and I'm just adding this
little part this is optional this is
what I like to do just to make it look a
little bit more realistic when I make it
into a side part
um style so yeah you'll see how that
turns out in the end but yeah you're
going to see me keep going back and just
making sure that I'm getting that lace
closure flat with this hot tool and it
does wonders
okay so this is when your rat tail comb
comes in a super clutch because now you
can get your part perfect and precise so
I'm just going to use some gorillas
Nigel I got this from my local beauty
supply store and I'm going to start
shelling my edges downwards so this is
also a way to make your hair blend in
with your lace closure unit if you do
kind of want to have some leave out and
not have the closure all the weight like
to your forehead if you know what I mean
so and as you can see I'm pulling more
and more hair out eventually I'm going
to take the wig off and just part the
hair straight back but back to gelling
your edges down what am i doing that's a
jelly in my edges down like I said you
want to go downwards because if you
start young your hair going straight
back it's going to look weird when you
put your unit on because by your hair
going in a downwards direction it's just
not going to look natural so you want to
gel down your hair in the way that your
wig is going to lay on your head and
it's just going to look like it's all
going in one direction if you know what
I mean you're going to see what I mean
in the end but that's how I can explain
it right now but like I said I just
remove the wig and now that I have kind
of a guide on where I want my part to be
with my natural hair I'm going to use
that guy that I parted when my wig was
on and just um part my hair straight
back so once I have that party straight
back I'm going to go in and gel the rest
of my hair down
and I really don't feel need to jail the
back of my hair down I mean to each its
own if you want to do that then go for
it but just for time sake I was just
like it's gonna be okay it's gonna lay
down but once you're done with that
you're gonna use a cotton scarf to wrap
around your hair if you want to use silk
going use silk I never use so this works
for me so that's what I want to do and
well that is going to set and all that
stuff I'm going to go in in style my
lace closure unit so once again this is
the peerless hair from aliexpress this
is their straight hair and this is air
dry so previous to making this video I
actually did wash this unit and bone
straight it just to see if it's going to
go back into that bone silky straight
texture and it actually did and after
that I did go in with this curling iron
and put some curls in it and the curls
did hold beautifully but I figured since
hair kind of holds a better curl when
the hair has a little more texture to it
I decided to wash this hair again let it
air dry and then go in straight from it
being air dry and curling it and I
figured that curls will come out so much
more bouncy and voluminous so that's
what I'm showing you all what I'm doing
right now and I will kind of have a
picture of how their hair looked when it
was curled when the hair was straight
but the hair does get backbone sure you
don't worry and as you can see I don't
really know how to describe how to curl
this hair but you can see what I'm going
to do over and over in these clips and
I'll also have two deals linked in the
description box below if you want a more
detailed visual and also a more detailed
tutorial on how to curl your hair with a
curling iron so make sure you check
those out if this one is it as detailed
for you but it's just going to be me
showing you how I curl this entire wig
so just keep watching
in another tip just to make sure that
your curls are setting super bouncy and
they're gonna come out very full when
you first start curling your hair like
the first time you pro your hair you
just want to make sure that you are
putting as many flexi rods in your hair
as possible so I am using medium sized
flexi rods and I'm enjoying multiple
curls so that when I take these down
they're going to be super big and fluffy
but the next day when you do reset your
hair with the flexi rods one thing is
that you will not have to Rico your hair
because your hair will already have that
kind of wavy curly texture and you won't
have to use as many flexi rods the
second time if you use a lot the first
time that's something that I learned and
it just saves a lot of time so just be
sure to use a medium sized flexi rods
not the big huge ones and your curls
will still fall and look like the big
curls that you may want but this is just
something that I learned and it works
perfectly for me so you can just go
ahead and try it and see the works for
you but it is a very good tip to keep in
mind when you are flexi riding your hair
and don't mind these big spacious areas
you see in the wig I had to take some of
these tracks out because y'all peerless
hair is thick to say is some straight
hair so I just remove just a couple of
tracks from the wig just to make it look
just a little bit more natural because
the hair was huge like very huge so I
just removed some tracks but if you want
your hair baby just leave those places
right there and don't worry about the
spaces you are not able to see them when
I applied it to my head so that was not
a problem
so now that you all have a general idea
of how I flex throughout my hair this is
the next day and look how perfectly my
hair was molded by this gorilla snot I
absolutely love this stuff and the best
thing is that it lasts about three days
until you have to reapply it to your
head so yeah that's about three days and
so it starts like kind of flaking up so
I mean it's a really good investment in
it does the job so now I'm removing all
of these flexi rods um the two little
red box rods you see is the two ones
that I had to reapply because the metal
that holds the flexi rot together um was
coming to lose into the curl so I had to
reapply to new ones and look at this
part it just looks super flat and
seamless I absolutely love this method
and as you can see how well my part is
going to blend in with my natural part
and I think it looks pretty good I
didn't add any foundation or any
concealer anything to help blend out
this unit so I mean if you are a darker
complexion and you want the scalp to
look more like your complexion you can
use this um holding die I will have it
listed in this video I'm not sure of the
name but you can use that guy and let
the closure kind of soak in it for a
couple of minutes just so we can get a
darker tint but I think that this
matches my skin tone pretty well so I
didn't add anything to this closure okay
so now all I'm going to do is comb all
these curls out don't worry it's not
going to make the hair straight or mess
up the curls or anything is just gonna
make these curls more fluffy and big and
less defined because I personally would
not walk out the door with those flexi
rod curls when I freshly take those
flexi rods out and I'm using my ace
Beauty brush from amazon.com I will have
a link to this brush in the description
box below but I absolutely love this
detangling brush it's super affordable
and compared to a wide toothed comb it
doesn't leave my hair tingly or what's
snagged in it and also it goes through
the hair like butter so
when I comb this through my flexi rods
is not making my hair tingly it
literally slides straight through the
hair and it makes my hair super fluffy
and curly which I love so much about
this brush and basically the rest of
this video is just me brushing out my
hair and just kind of finger curling it
to my desired style
okay so in this clip right here is me
applying the exact same style unit but
the only difference I did and these
clips right here is I didn't apply the
lace closure unit further back on to my
natural hair like I did in the previous
clips so as you can see the lace closure
unit is further up to my forehead and
I'm not sure why I did it different the
second time but I actually like how it
came out and the previous clips rather
than right here but I know everyone has
their different opinions so I am curious
to know which one you all like better so
in the comment section below
I want you lots of comic team glossy our
team Brown team glossy of course is for
the previous clips and team Brown is of
course this clip because I have on brown
lipstick so yeah I'm just curious to
know so comment teen glossy our team
Brown in the comment section below so I
can see what you want personally think
so yeah thank you all so much for
watching this video I really hope that
you found it
beyond helpful and you can slay and
style in lay your next lace closure unit
or your current one but I really hope
that it helps you and don't forget to
