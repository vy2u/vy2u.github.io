so this video is going to be pretty
quick in the beginning and towards the
end you're just going to see me styling
the hair so this is my natural four
month post big chop hair this is it with
no type of product in it and just towel
dried for about 30 minutes so it's
really dry looking so excuse the texture
and all that the curls are not formed
but this is my hair combed out and all
you can see I'm doing is basically just
raking all of this gorilla snot through
my hair and that's really basically all
I do for my TWA a lot of people ask me
questions on how do you get your lace
front wigs to lay so flat and this is
just what I do and I also do this with
my lace closure wigs so if you want to
check out my video on that it would be
linked in the description box below but
honestly I really don't want to talk too
much in this video just in the intro so
you all can get a general idea of what
I'm doing but it's super simple and this
is what I do for my TWA at the moment
and as my hair starts to grow I'll start
to experiment with more things that
works for the length but yeah I really
hope you all enjoyed this video and I
will see you all in my next clip
Oh
okay so as for styling my units
everything in this video was just the
natural state of the hair no type of
products was used and I guess it just
depends on what type of hair texture
your hair has but mostly what most of my
hair textures I really don't have to use
any other products besides a brush a
flutter in the hair so as you can see
I'm just detangling the hair making sure
there's no snags or anything and I'm
going in with my dye and straightening
brush you can purchase this from
amazon.com a lot of people ask me where
do you purchase that brush and I'll have
it linked in the description box below
so you can just click on it and purchase
it it's super affordable
it gets my hair bone straight how I like
it
and with this hair it was even more
simple because the hair already had such
a very soft texture to it so look how
beautiful and sleek this looks I
absolutely fell in love you can like see
the difference from the natural texture
of the hair and the straightened texture
so even though this hair was straight um
once I washed it with the Aussie moist
condition with the Aussie moist shampoo
I also put the Aussie moist conditioner
in it and let the hair air dry once I
washed out the conditioner and that was
the natural texture of the hair so it
does wake up so if you want you know a
little way to your hair then this hair
is perfect for you also but it goes back
super bone straight so don't worry so
yeah that's basically what I'm gonna do
to the entire head and then where the
frontal is you're going to see me use a
curling iron barrel just to get the
roots of the hair super flat and sleep
so just stay tuned for that
Oh
you
you
you
so this will conclude my little tutorial
hopefully you all found this super
informative and to take something from
it if you have the TWA or a texture
similar to my but that's basically all I
do for now is if anything have any
updates or anything I'll let you all
know but yeah thank you guys so much for
watching don't forget to Like comment
and subscribe and I will see you all in
my next video bye guys
besides me you know covenant when it's
longer into me just damaging all that
hard work of growth so I don't know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
