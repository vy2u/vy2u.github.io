materials that I use to make my lace
frontal wig and I already have a video
on how I customize my you part of you
part wig so if you want to check that
out check the description box below but
I use the exact same things I'm just
sewing a lace frontal onto here and the
steps are the same but I am doing some
things a bit differently just so it can
laid super flat and more secure since we
are adding something else to the way and
this is the lace front so I will be
using my knots are already bleached so
if you want to see how I did that check
the description box below and I'm
pushing that frontal a little bit in
front of that mesh cap just so when I
put the wig on the hair won't be laying
exactly all my hairline but just a
little bit forward and I'm sticking that
down with stick pins so that I make sure
that everything is even on the left and
right side and everything is flat for me
to sew down
and right here I'm just showing you all
that I didn't show on the elastic band
just so you can adjust it to make it
tighter or looser and also you see how I
flap that part up that's kind of where
the lace frontal comes to cover your
edges up so you don't want to sew that
down onto the wig cap because if you are
planning on wearing your lace frontal in
front of your hairline you want to have
this little flap right here to cover
your ear and you'll see a clear visual
of what I'm talking about towards the
end of the video but as you can see I'm
sticking the needle through the thread
and wrapping the thread three times
around the needle just to secure that
that lace frontal is not going anywhere
and I'm just sewing it down just like
any other tread you just want to make
sure you secure it so it's not going to
be flapping up right there and I'm just
going to continue sewing it down by
pulling the needle through the thread
kind of making it a loop just to make
sure that it lays flat and I'm doing
this super close together just to make
sure that it's not going to come up or
have like any bubbles in between the
lace so yeah just keep doing that and as
you can see it's kind of like a track
going across in there super close
together so just stick the needle
through the thread pull through stick
the needle through the thread and pull
through and just keep doing that until
you get to the other side
so now that I made it to the end of the
other side I'm going to stick the needle
through and wrap the thread three times
around the needle and pull it through
just to make sure the knot is secured
and I'm going to cut that
and right here I'm just showing you the
little flat by the ear again you will
cut the access release off later but as
you can see that that was not sewn down
everything else is sewn down and
everything else is super flat that's
exactly what we want and now we're going
to go on and continue to sew the tracks
on okay so now I'm going to sew the
tracks on and I did double the wealth at
the bottom because I had four bundles
and I wanted to try to fit as much hair
as I can as possible so I'm sewing it on
starting from the lace frontal and I'm
going down where the Nate area is and
then connecting it to the other side of
the lease run solo and once again I'm
sticking that needle through the weft
wrapping the thread three times around
the needle and pulling it through just
to make sure it's secure and I'm sewing
it down the exact same way I did with
the front so just not as close together
and I'm going to show you all where I
went wrong with this lace frontal wig
this was my first time ever making a
full wig so I did make a mistake but I
was able to catch it and correct it so I
came back and showed you all the correct
way but this is okay I did this part
right but when you get to a certain area
on the cap you want to start sewing in a
different direction just because when
you flap the hair back from the lace
front so you just want to make sure that
everything lays super seamlessly and
flat and this is where I realized I went
wrong eventually I had to take off all
of these tracks and redo it because I
came up too far behind the hump of the
styrofoam head so as you can see I'm
surpassing the hump behind the cellphone
head and that was just too far up and I
was connecting the weft to the back of
the lace frontal which caused the wig to
lace super lumpy when I flap the hair
from the frontal bag because it just
wasn't laying seamlessly so I had to
figure out a way and just take all the
hair off and redo it but I should have
just stopped and start going
horizontally from track to track rather
than from the frontal to the other side
of the front zone and I know it's pretty
confusing right now but you will see
visually what I'm talking about later on
in the video so I know it's kind of
confusing I was confused myself but
you're going to see what I'm talking
about this is wrong this is the wrong
way I'm going to show you all the right
way in a couple of second and I kept
sewing like this until I got to the
Front's of that lace front so in this
was my result I was like something is
off this is not right it's not laying
flat what is going on I was literally
flat ironing I sprayed water on it
pressed it with the flat iron again and
it was not laying flat for anything I
was like no what is going on I look like
I have an egg head I look like Dolly
Parton no this was unacceptable so I
figured out what I did wrong and I
corrected it and as you can see right
here this is all the hair that I had to
cut off and redo because when I put the
hair on it was just so bulky and was not
laying or sling none of that so I had to
start over so learn from my mistakes and
do it the right way
and another mistake that I made was
doubling the web's when it was getting
closer to the lace frontal don't I
advise you don't do that
I personally suggest that you start
single wedding it just so you ensure
that it lays flat and I'm just
stretching this to you all because I do
not want you all to take apart half of
your wig and just have to do the same
thing over when you could have done it
right the first time so I rather I make
the mistake and share it with you all
and you just do it the right way because
I know a lot of people do not have time
to be remaking wigs and all of that so
yeah I just want to show you that I'm
not perfect I do experience errors when
I'm doing new stuff so this was one of
the errors and as you can see this was
all of the hair that I removed and this
is the area where I'm going to start
laying horizontally
and I'm demonstrating with my hands
showing you all right here how we're
going to start laying those tracks so
side to side we're going to just connect
it to the other side of the track you
see how my hand is going yeah like that
not towards the frontal on the tracks
like that okay and I know I'm saying
this over and over but this is how you
want to start laying it with the tracks
and this is how I was laying it like
this don't do it like that but do it
like this not like this but like this
okay so where I previously went wrong
was that I came up too far sowing the
hair in AU rather than going
horizontally and just to make sure that
your measurements are right just make
sure you start going straight across
towards the back of the um styrofoam
head so when you feel yourself going
above the hump that's when you know that
you went too far so as you can see I
sold the hair about midway in towards
the middle of the hair I'm going to
start sewing from track to track rather
than towards the frontal
invincible
okay so now that we are closer to the
front oh I'm leaving this little space
that I'm going to fill in later I just
want to make sure that I get this track
as flat and close as possible to the
frontal so I'm sticking this needle
through the frontal into the track and
wrapping the thread three times around
the needle and pulling it through and
this is just making sure that it's
secure and it's going to lay super flat
and I'm sewing down this track the exact
same way I did with the frontal so I'm
looping the needle through the thread
and I'm sewing it closely together not
as Spacey as I did with the other tracks
just because I don't want it to move
around and when I flap that hair from
the frontal bag to cover this track it's
going to cover it seamlessly and
flawlessly
you
okay so once I reached the other side of
the wig I cut that thread off and then
I'm just showing you all how flat it is
and how close it is to that frontal it
is seamless because when I tried it on
it was perfect I was so happy that I
corrected this it was awesome
so now just right here I'm showing you
all the space that I have and I will be
playing one more track down right there
so you won't be seeing a mesh cap when
you actually put the wig on
you
yes so we're finally done with this wig
making process I was super pleased with
this result and it was such a big
difference I'm so happy I was able to
catch it before I put this video out and
actually styled the hair because it was
laying nice when I had the hair wavy but
once I straightened it it wasn't laying
flat so I'm happy that I experimented
with more before I put this video out
for you all to watch but as you can see
I'm flapping that lace frontal hair over
that track that I connected to it and it
was so flat I was so pleased and so
happy with this result and I'm so happy
that I caught my mistake because oh my
gosh I'm just so happy as you can see
you cannot see not one track not any
thread
it's just flawless and seamless I
absolutely loved it
all right so once you're done making
your wig the correct way this is me back
on the old way when I did it wrong but
this was not the problem so I'm showing
you all how to cut the mesh of the rest
of the cap from the way just so when you
put the hair on your head you won't be
seen unless you'll be seeing you know
your scalp and braids so I'm going to
show you all that the elastic still does
work because we didn't sew on it and now
we're just going to get full scissors
and cuts along and I was sure to not cut
so so so so so close to the lace because
I didn't want to unravel the thread so I
am cutting just a little bit above the
actual lace where it's sewn down just
because I don't want to unravel that
entire lace and mess up my entire wig
now we're going to be cutting that
excess lace from the hair and I'm just
going to cut straight across and then I
will make any adjustments if I want to
cut off more lace because it's better to
cut off less lace and then go back and
you know tweak it because once you cut
out too much you can't go back but you
know if you don't cut off too much you
can always tweak it and adjust it how
you want it to look on your head so I
just went straight across and also by
the ear area and then if I saw some
extra lace that I want to cut off I just
cut that off after
so now I'm going to show any last
advance on to my wake just so that at
least super snug because I do not so
this way down or glue it so this was
from Walmart and it was like two dollars
and it comes with a lot of you a stake
and you won't even use half of this but
all I do was measure my ear from ear to
ear and I stretched it super tight just
because I can take the you know snugness
of the elastic all my head so I did it
as tight as I can and connect that from
the flaps on the lace frontal and I just
sold that down okay so I just want you
all to be aware that I am sewing the
elastic band on to the flaps that I did
not so on to the cap that I show you all
in the beginning and this was because I
did wear this wig behind my ears so I
did sort of have some leave out out and
it wasn't a full lace frontal wig where
none of my edges were showing I did have
some hair that was visible but if you
are wearing this as a full lace frontal
do not show your elastic band on to the
ear flat part because if you are wearing
it like that it's going to interrupt
with it covering your edges so just make
sure that if you are wearing it as a
full frontal wig so the elastic band a
little bit behind that flat just so that
flap can cover your edges in front of
your ear does that make sense I try to
make that as clear as possible
and once you're done showing that other
side down this is how your wig should
look I think you all so much for
