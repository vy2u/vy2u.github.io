is going to be yet another hair review
and this hair is from a company called
matched tress and you can visit their
site it's net stress calm I will have
all of their information of course
linked in the description box below and
also all of the information specs on
this hair so a lot of people asked me in
my previous videos and in my comments do
I bleach the knocks on all of my friends
hose and yes even if the front row is
kind of tinted or light I still do
bleach the not just so it won't have
like that black tint or black look of
the knots on my front soul and I also
pluck all of the baby hairs on my
frontal in the hairline just to give it
just a more natural look and that's even
if my friend toes are already pre plug
so now on to this color a lot of people
have been asking me is this how the hair
came on snapchat says you all first saw
it on my Instagram and then I kind of
coached it on my snapchat so first of
all this is not the natural length of
the hair also my friend did cut it in a
bob asymmetrical bob I don't even know
if it's a bob but she cut it um what the
razor and I will have a picture of how
she cut it also cuz I didn't record that
footage but I did bleach to this hair
three times and then I did go and and
tone it and I will show you all the
process of that if you want to see the
exact process of how I did this and
exact boxes of the color that I use on
this hair so make sure you stay tuned
for that but as for shedding with the
hair okay so me bleaching my hair did
cause the hair to shade but surprisingly
it didn't cause the hair to tangle like
I have no problems with this hair
tangling may be in the bag just because
that is where my neck
may get sweaty and it may just kind of
snag and tangle but that's the only
problems I really have with this hair is
the shedding some me bleaching it and
possibly meat over processing it because
I did go in with a treatment after me
doing all that processing and bleaching
and all of that stuff but if I don't
really think that it did too much of a
difference but it was worth the try but
the hair is still very silky hpc it has
a lot of movement and it's just a
problem with the shedding so I'll get a
little blonde strands every day every
day and another thing with the bleaching
process is that I was watching some
bleaching videos and tawny videos of how
people got their hair at this ashy
blonde color and they were suggesting
that you should plan on cutting your
hair if you're not professionally giving
it done and I'm not going to lie on this
hair did have a lot of split ends after
going through the process of bleaching
it washing it out letting me drive
lesion and again but once I did that
then it was pretty damaged so I did cut
off majority of that damage but other
than that I cut all of that off so I
really don't have that problem with
tangling but it's just what they're
shedding just because those are some of
those split ends that got you know
damaged by the bleach and the toning so
there was a lot of processing so yeah
that's basically all I have all the
products listed below and in the video
sold off any questions so just see if
this in the video first Ben asked me if
I didn't sing it in here so yeah that's
basically all I have to say about this
hair is really really good hair but it's
just if you plan on wearing it in the
longer state then I don't really know
how it will turn out because it was very
straggly and thin and broken off at the
ends so yeah other than that the hair is
blowing pretty good so far once again
this is a full lace frontal way that I
made so yeah don't worry I'll show you
on the beginning to end process of this
if you're interested and trying this
yourself is not as hard as it looks it's
not as hard as it looks in other videos
where you have the head like a loon and
folio and fishing it off and all that
stuff it's just a couple of stouts and
then you can get this color so it's very
um do-it-yourself type of thing and yeah
it was super easy so if you're
interested in seeing how I got this
color and how this hair turned out and
definitely stay tuned and I will see you
all in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
