today's video is going to be yet another
hair review and I have reviewed this
company on my channel a couple of months
ago so if you're interested in seeing
that review also make sure you click the
link in the description box below but
the name of this company is lucky hair
and in my previous review I reviewed
there I think it was their straight hair
and a 360 lace frontal and this time
around I have three bundles of 24 inch
and a lace frontal and I did construct
this wig myself this is probably one of
the best links that I ever constructed
and these were probably one of the most
exciting wigs so we're just because the
frontal like I posted it on snapchat and
you guys were like messaging me like
crazy like please make a video on this
hair but it was just the frontal so I
haven't even showed you guys my hair yet
so I have been wearing this hair for two
weeks I'm not really sure I was wearing
the wig once and then I took it off and
ended up putting it back on to glue it
down and I will have all the specs right
here if you're interested in checking
this hair out also if you're interested
in purchasing it I will have the links
below if you want to see the prices and
all of that stuff so the background
behind this hairstyle is simply because
this hair has been through two weekends
of like straight turn up like Friday
Saturday Sunday this Friday Saturday and
Sunday like straight up so when I got
home of course I was tired and I just
through the hair and my body and just
woke up and just like continued the next
day just brushed it out and styled it
so this hair has been through literally
hell like literally so I'm very pleased
with how it held up through the cold the
rain and like the humidity cuz the
weather fluctuates down here so I'm very
pleased with how the hair held up also
their customers
is really good I went back and forth
with the person sending me the hair and
they were really nice so I'm
appreciative of that and I really
wouldn't have worked with this company
again if I didn't like their hair I did
like the hair that I previewed in my
past review for this company so yeah I
rather like this hairstyle I wasn't
planning on wearing my hair like this
that often just because I like to
experiment with my front soles but think
about this hair and you will see in the
video set my frontal was listing on this
side so I had to have this hair hold up
for a couple more days
just until I can kind of tweak it
because I'm going through finals and all
of that stuff so just until I can take
care of what's going on over here I did
this braids so this is gonna get me
pickles a couple of days but I really do
like this hair and I think you guys
should check out their website and just
check it out for yourself look at my
other reviews and other reviews on this
hair on YouTube and also another thing
um the front so it did start to so
not both but of course consoles are
gonna share and also I do have this unit
glued down so the front sole is kind of
losing the baby hairs out there but that
won't be a problem just to tweak it all
I had to do is take it off and just
create a few more and cut the excess
lace off but the wig is super flared
like I said this was one of my favorite
wigs and I could instructed because I
got it super flat and I can put in a
ponytails and all like all of that stuff
so I really hope you guys enjoyed this
little review and hopefully you guys
enjoy how I did this braid I'm not show
you from start to finish and it's really
simple I'm not a brighter so I'm not
perfect then I hope you guys don't
really look for instructions on how to
braid in this video I just showed you
guys how I got this specific style and
it's really cute
see and quick so thank you guys so much
for watching don't forget to Like
comment and subscribe and I will see you
guys in my next video bye guys
okay so this is the hair right here as
you guys can see it looks kind of so I
have three bundles of 24 inch and a lace
from so and I can honestly want to say
that this hair when I first bought it
and it was so beautiful but like I said
after when I got inside and stuff I was
like really tired so I just do it in my
bonnet and I didn't really have time to
spell it in the morning I literally just
took all the bonnet and brushed it and
like threw some curls in it so my front
so here they're kind of coming off now
just because I wasn't taking that much
care of the front so how I should have
but I was tired and the hair still
wasn't up like but my friends who was
lifting and honestly I just need to have
this hair hold it for about three more
days until I get my hair done and I just
need to preserve the style so I'm gonna
do a big jumbo braid in the front just
so you can't see my front so but I will
put pictures in the video just so you
all can see how the hair look the hair
was beautiful and a lot of you guys will
just ask any questions about them here
when I was posting it on my snapchat
social media Instagram all this stuff so
I'm just gonna show you guys a quick
braid that I'm gonna do is gonna look
super pretty and I'm just gonna kind of
wing it but I have it an imagination of
the picture in my head so I'm just gonna
wing it and let's see what I can do
and now I'm just going to pull the braid
over the front so just pull it until it
covers the front sole like this now I'm
going to bring this up more just cuz I'm
gonna curl this little part right here
instead of having it just that's an
entire breed
that's what site
and my frontal is lifting on this side
because I usually work this side behind
the ear I don't know why the other side
was looking good we have to cover that
up because this hair needs to last for a
couple more days</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
