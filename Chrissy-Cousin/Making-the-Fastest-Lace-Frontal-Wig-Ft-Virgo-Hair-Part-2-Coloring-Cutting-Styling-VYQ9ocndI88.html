haven't watched part 1 already make sure
you go and check that out before you
watch this one because it leads up to
the sequence of events to this week so
make sure you go check it out so if you
guys aren't familiar with the Laurie oh
hi color highlights on my channel
already then you might want to get used
to it because I use pretty much all of
their colors but all I did was fix one
box with a 40 volume developer and I did
end up using the other box I simply just
didn't want to use bleach and this was
the only thing that I had that didn't
allow me to use bleach so it was super
simple super quick and also asked for
cutting the hair I'm not a pro at
cutting don't tell me what I should have
done because I was just having fun and I
pretty much use this guy to cut the rest
of my hair so I just went with the flow
and just had fun with this color and cut
so hopefully you guys enjoy and find
something helpful in here to help you
with your next hairstyle
you
so this concludes part two if you
haven't watched part one already make
