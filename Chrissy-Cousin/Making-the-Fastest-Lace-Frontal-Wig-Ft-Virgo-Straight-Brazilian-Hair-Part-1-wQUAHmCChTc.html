hair review initial review but it also
will be a tutorial also and I'm super
excited about this hair just because I
really like this cut is something
different I wanted to go shorter this
year but I did that what ash blonde hair
and that didn't really last long so I'm
headed I got something more normal so if
you guys are interested in the hair that
I have in my hand the information will
be right here the Aliexpress vendor and
also the lengths I did cut this hair
that I will show you guys how I did that
also just a little snippet but pretty
much just showing you guys how you can
make a wig under an hour like under an
hour no longer and I really enjoyed this
method I'm gonna see how long it lasts I
would say that I don't recommend this on
hair that you spend a lot of money on it
is something that I would recommend
doing if you have a collection of legs
or you really just need something quick
so you can go to that event and then you
know take it off but yeah something
you're gonna be like doing a lot of
extracurricular activities and I
wouldn't really recommend this method
just because it is glue and eventually
it may come apart but this hair was very
soft it took the color really well I
didn't want to use bleach just because I
was scared of damaging it but the cover
that I didn't use in this video took it
really well and it took it really really
fast so I was happy about that because I
didn't have to really wait as long as I
probably would have with some other hair
so yeah this is the look hopefully you
guys like it just as much as I did it's
something out of my comfort zone you
guys are not used to see me in something
this short so but I really did enjoy
doing this and it was super easy and
fast under an hour
yeah hopefully you guys enjoy this video
don't forget to Like comment and
subscribe and I will see you guys in my
next video bye guys okay so everything
in this video is pretty much
self-explanatory this is like the
fastest method of making a wig so all of
these items was found at Walmart and the
wig cap was found at my local Beauty
Supply Store so basically all I'm doing
is tracing the end of the lace front so
and then I'm just gonna glue that onto
the cap and it's super simple it held
and you're gonna see me pull it and it's
not gonna go anywhere and I'm gonna do
the exact same thing with the bundles
and guys the hair and frontal was super
soft I did have to pluck the front so
just a little bit more but that wasn't a
problem because I do that with all of my
frontals but the bundles were super soft
I only used two but you're gonna see how
I adjust those bundles and align them on
the cap to have them lace super flat and
seamless
so another reason why I say this is for
a quick and go type of method for making
wigs it's because you are gonna have to
cut these tracks and if this is super
expensive hair then you may not want to
do that because that kind of causes the
hair to shed I didn't have any problems
with shedding with this hair so far so I
don't think that would be an issue and
plus the glue kind of helps fill it so
I'm not really sure how long it will
last but I will keep trying it out and I
really like this method just because it
was super fast but if it is super
expensive hair then I pretty much
wouldn't recommend this but you can try
it yourself that's just my personal
opinion
well this is pretty much the end of part
one if you guys want to see how I cut
style and color this unit make sure you
check out part two it will be right in
this video towards the end so you can
click it so make sure you go check that
out and as you can see the wig just
peeled off so it's super easy and yeah
I'll see you guys at part two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
