today's video is going to be yet another
hair review this is kind of like an
initial hair review only because I
haven't been wearing it for too long but
so far this hair is so beautiful as you
all can see I've been wearing it for
about a week I know I come on and you
know tell you guys about hair about two
weeks after I wear it but I have been
wearing a pair for we the exact date
will be in the videos of it all so from
the top of my hand but this is the
beauty forever is the Malaysian Dee
curly hair and this is been the inches
26 26 24 24 and they also sent me a 20
inch lace frontal so as for how many
bundles I use for this unit this is a
full Lakeridge I do have a video on how
I make all my lace frontal way to expose
your waist Nuvi part wigs all that so if
you all are interested in seeing how I
construct my unit definitely go check
out those videos and I did wish the not
all my friends'll and I also did custom
plug this front so only because it was
just a little bit too much hair for my
liking and most of the time I always
have to plug my lace frontals only
because you know you want that realistic
looking hair line but the only person
that I really didn't have to manipulate
and pluck was the ally was the virgle
hair so that was the only front that
kind of came free plug but like I said I
did plus this one which I didn't have
any problem with and I only use about
three bundles if I'm not mistaken I
would have initially used tool bundles
in a front so like I did with my le
great hair but that was straight hair
this is curly hair so I kind of wanted
it to be a little bit more fuller than I
usually would like to go with so I used
about three and a half bundles and
look so freaking beautiful I love the
density of this hair I was kind of iffy
about wanting to review this hair but I
was like let me just try it because if I
haven't tried it then I wouldn't really
know because if you all have seen my le
Annabelle hair that was I think the
first curly hair was the second the
first deep curly hair that I ever
reviewed on my channel and then hair was
freaking huge
and big but the curls were super super
the size and the density of the hair was
so heavy and what I mean by density I
mean like the hair was it was like a
heavy curl in this hair it kind of
reminds me of Judas hair where it's more
of a finely grain hair is not I'm gonna
try to compare like well I don't have
the video footage on my computer anymore
but kogo again my Annabelle curly hair
and as you can see like the freakin
difference in the texture of the hair
that was more thicker and this one is a
little bit more v and fluffy and more
Airy that's kind of what I want to sing
is how to describe it but it's more of
an airy texture it is super super light
is fluffy and I'm so so so so happy that
I gave this hair a try because I loved
it I was scared that these curls were
not going to be defined because
initially when it came out of the
package I'm gonna show you all with some
footage some clips of how we look the
hair that is look straggly there was
thin but once I made the unit wash this
unit and on condition and let it air dry
I use my Aussie conditioner shampoo and
looked at air dried this is how the hair
came out just like this I didn't do
anything to this year I didn't put any
conditioner in it I didn't brush it so
what I did is I wash the unit and after
I worked the conditioner out I called
the conditioner out while was under the
water with my HDD brush and literally I
just drenched the wig and I hung it up
on like a little rack and I let
air dry for about a day and a half and
this was the result no products nothing
at all well it probably has just a
little bit of conditioner in it but Y
all of these are the curls in the Sun I
love it so much I like that I'm trying
different textures of curly hair and I
kind of can figure out what I really
like but if you all like more of a thick
heavy type of hair definitely go to the
Annabelle hair but if you all like just
a natural looking you know Beach curl be
curly I would definitely go with this
one and ikana
and still in this one just a little bit
more so this is just so pretty pretty I
love this curl it looks more of a
natural you know hair so I like that I
really don't have to do anything to this
hair is low-maintenance it really didn't
have any shedding so far other than meat
plucking the frontal and me watching the
frontal and it's just like that extra
shedding for me plucking it like foolin
with it it's curly hair it may get a
little bit tangled not as much as some
other curly hair would but this hair is
super low-maintenance this is what I
love about it so far I'm going to keep
wearing it to get it gist and you know
come back a big shoe all on the chair
but so far I'm really loving it if you
also want some nice summer spring hair I
definitely would you know go with this
and I will keep you all updated on it
but I also have surprise so make sure
you all check out my next video after
this one and you find out how you can
get some hair like this from Gd forever
