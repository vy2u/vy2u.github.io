impression on these outfits that I got
from fashion Nova and this is my first
time trying on all of these clothes in
the video so make sure you stay tuned to
see because y'all I'm gonna just let
y'all watch it but before I get them to

this well-known app the name of this app
is Poshmark

talking about Poshmark and get a whole
lot of designer clothes designer bags
shoes Michael Kors Nike Adidas
all those different type of items on
this app from other people so it's their
hand-me-downs but they're slightly worn
and you can also like see the quality
and stuff on their page so I made my
very own a pockmark so you guys can go
ahead and follow and see the things that
I will be posting on my Poshmark page
for you guys to buy for a very
affordable price one of the items that
would be all my Poshmark
is that jumper that I had on last week

up my deals like where did you get that
jumpsuit from because I posted it on my
Instagram story and you can purchase
that item so make sure you go ahead and

in the description box for you to
download the app and also you can make
your very own Poshmark to sell your own
and slightly more clothes handbags
anything on there so make sure you
download the app and I'm super excited
for you guys to receive some of the
clothes that I don't wear anymore
so that's basically all I have to say
about that and I'm super excited about
this China haul so let's get straight
into the video okay so this is the first
dress super cute super summery
on a tube dress kind of girls so even
like in my other fashion alcohol y'all
felt like I had that skirt on and like
the two shirt I love those kinds of
things this is in a size small all of my
dresses are in a size small so this is
the first one okay so this is the second
dress this one is obviously similar to
the first one but this one is called the
Eva dress in this beautiful cobalt blue
color how it looks in the bag it's the
very form-fitting and the small fits
like a glove this one does come more
under the knee than other one which I
really like I like the yellow color but
if it was in this material I think I
like it a little better because I can
get away with not wearing a bra with
this one just because of like flattens
out those areas whereas with that one
you would probably have to because it's
like poking out so I like this material
much better and I like how this one fits
better so yes this is not this is my
favorite one so far okay so this is the
third dress the only thing about like
trying on first impression triangles if
you don't know which one is your
favorite so I think this one is my
favorite now if you guys don't have a
sense of my style by now then I don't
know like what to tell you because this
off-the-shoulder is giving me like like
this is so classy do you see this lift
so this is called the Stockholm mini
dress and this one this material I've
never had a dress in this type of
material I don't know if it's like
cotton but it has like this little
material where it's kind of bumpy so I
guess texture to the
this is so cute I love this and this is
how the back looks so this is the next
piece so everybody is wearing these
jumpsuits you can look on probably any
fashion page and everybody is wearing a
motive square Yelp's ooh I don't know if
that video is what is when this came out
but um everybody's wearing it and I just
want it you know but I really just
wanted to try this I am and it fits so
good y'all
I love this let's just start off like
this yeah okay so when I was looking at
the site I was like I'm gonna try
something different you know I usually
don't wear jumpsuits just because I
don't want high waters yo I dunno where
I'll wear this but um I don't know I'm
so glad I tried this is so cute I like
how it fits it's long enough is this my
favorite so far I don't know I don't
know this is probably home
some people would wear it look at this
fashion no but you could I'm sure I was
not expecting this to fit this day
oh y'all I'm hot in this Oh okay so
these are the jeans these are in a size
5 and these are I believe the classic
wash in light medium but this is how
they look they're super comfortable and
also very stretchy it's not a jegging
because they're not then but I really
like this material I feel like I'm
definitely gonna go back and get the
other colors because when I was looking
on the site they had I believe a light
wash a dark wash and then I like medium
if I'm not
taken I know I have a lot of genes and
they're like bulky right here and they
snag like on every little thing that
comes in contact to them the feeds are
really flat and seamless sort of like
how this fits and they're super
comfortable so I don't think I'll have a
problem with these but I'm so shook like
these things come all the way down to my
ankles and a lot of tall girls have
problems with their jeans fitting so I
think these will be perfect for my tummy
girls like I said this is the size 5 and
even if I back up you can see that I
still have some room at the bottom so I
really like that I feel like I'm
definitely gonna go back and get the
other colors in this so for an
affordable price you can get jeans and
it's you whether you're really skinny
tall short which you guys really won't
have a problem with but yeah
shout out to fashion over okay so this
is the next shirt maybe passing the iron
over it would have been a good idea
but I didn't so please subscribe this
one like this one is in a size small and
this one is called the do not talk to me
shirt which explains because when I
looked on the side of the shirt it says
antisocial and it says that on the other
side also and this is how the bank with
the vet kind of dips down and I have
another similar shirt like this I really
like like oversized crop top shirts so
this is the first one and the next one
is this one okay so this is the next
shirt this one I'm not sure this name
but I know this is in a size medium
instead of a small you can even switch
the shoulders but I'm right-handed so
you know it looks
on the shoulder and this is how the back
one and it dips down just like the other
shirt so it's not crap like all the way
throughout the shirt and you don't
necessarily even have to wear it off
your shoulder you can even wear it like
this I think I like this way better yeah
this one looks so much better I like
this one this is the third shirt this
one is my favorite so far
favorite okay so this is the final shirt
this one is called the stone-cold
bodysuit and this one is probably my
favorite a bodysuit that I really have
nothing like this in my wardrobe so it's
simple black and I was gonna wear a bra
with it but the fact is like this and
also what I really like about this
bodysuit is that you can bring it all
the way up here and then you can also
write it all the way down here so this
is what I really like about this
bodysuit um depending on you know how
you feeling you can bring it you can zip
it up or if it fit Donald I'll probably
like we're right here because all the
way down there is born a little bit too
much for me another slight that on its
stretchy but it's also like a bathing
suit material but the only thing I don't
like about this body suit is that it
doesn't have like the clamps so you have
to wait take off the entire bodysuit and
use the rest of them which I really
don't like because most of the time is
like really cold in those places so I
don't like that at all so that's the
only downfall of this body stupid other
than that everything fills it looks good
concludes my second fashion over try on
