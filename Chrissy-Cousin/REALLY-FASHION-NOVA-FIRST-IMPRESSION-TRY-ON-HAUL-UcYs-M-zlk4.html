back to my channel
so today's you know it's going to be
super exciting but before I get into the
video let's just address the elephant in
the room you guys have been wondering
where have I been
and there's literally no like video
everybody's like barely kicking VSAC is
going to be super exciting by the way I
do have shorts on so if you're wondering
I just wear oversized shirts like
everything but today's video is so
exciting because I'm doing a fashion
overhaul of course you guys have heard
about that you know but if you have it
you obviously live on a different brand
X literally before I call a profession
over I was on their website for every
event like everyone and also I have not
tried like any of these pizzas in it so
if I like them if I don't like just you
guys are going to see what's going on
like firsthand I'm gonna try to like
pair these outfits how the fashion of a
girl ten on one site because everyone
wants to look like well not everyone but
I wanted to like a fashion over the
world
Instagram daddy you know what I mean so
that's what about the goons and
no wait another thing make sure you guys
hit that notification bow that's the
only way you guys are going to see when
I upload new videos from now on so make
sure you hit that notification button
next to the subscribe button and you
guys will be sent like you want the
worry about Matt see you my videos when
I post don't make sure you hit that now
let's get straight into the video okay
so this is the first piece it's like
this little mini skirt obviously it's
rose gold and this is from fashion oval
but it didn't come with the clothes that
I got for this haul and this is called
the let'em no skirt and it's so cute
they make sugar look like I got a little
so usually when I order like off of
websites I get largest for some reason
because I am taller so I want my stuff
to fit long but I have to realize that
I'm kind of small petite so the small is
really what I should be doing but I get
like the sides is for my height so this
is actually a small it fits really good
I'm glad I didn't get a large because
that little bit tragic it feels really
good and I'm able to like move in it if
I could do this in it then that means
that it's fit
let them know sir yes honey yes yes let
them know ok so this is the second item
ok so you're on when I told y'all hi
getting largest this is a large and it
looks like the large because the arms
are so long and this would be like poofy
arms but they kind of like hang a little
too much then they are supposed to the
model kind of hand like on a short so
that's what I care my shirtless I
definitely feel like I could have got
away with a the least well the most
being a medium I feel like the medium
would have fit much better it's not like
looser anything I'm here so that's the
good thing it's just that these are like
a little too long but that's on my
behalf because I just want to order
stuff so big and it's kind of supposed
to be crap but these are high-waisted
shorts so that's really not showing on
camera but this is really comfortable
and I was like how I like my shoulders
out I love my shoulders so this is
really cute I like this it's so
comfortable and you can even pair this
like what jeans or something and then
their nests
you have to be sure that I want to be a
fashion know the model today so I did
the shorts like she did so I believe
this letter came in another color if I'm
not mistaken I think it looks black but
I got the great great goes with anything
great goes with everything so I really
like this but the only downfall is my
arms and I'm taller so for this large to
fit like large actually is like wow like
it's really a large you know so this is
cute I like this but ladies if you're
anything smaller than me shorter than me
medium small is your best it's so cute I
love this it's so comfortable okay so I
don't think this is supposed to fit like
this because this
I don't remember picking this out hold
on oh that makes sense okay so this is
the false favorite swift sweater and
it's actually supposed to go like this
so you just pick this up and then you do
today
that's that looks more like what I
picked out but this is not supposed to
look this is so cute and what size is
this okay so I actually got this in a
medium/large
um I'm okay with this in a medium/large
first sweaters well this is meant to be
like an oversized sweater the other one
was kind of meant to be fitted just a
little bit but this is an oversized
sweater and this is a medium/large I
don't regret not getting a small/medium
it comes in small/medium medium/large
I don't regret getting a smaller sizes
because it's supposed to fit like
off-the-shoulder scrunched up in the
back kind of like this so this is so
cool and you probably like to wear like
this too now you can wear like one
shoulder
okay so you definitely need some covers
with this because you can't really well
a strapless bra maybe but definitely
some covers because I definitely almost
flashed you guys there you don't want to
see that you know but this is so cute
it's so comfortable
I can definitely like pair this with
some hills this is also how the model
was wearing it on the fashion notice I
she had some rips in her jeans and I
don't know this is so cute I really love
this I really do and I think they had um
two other colors if I'm not mistaken I
know I thought burgundy the burgundy one
was to die but I don't really have like
any cream new sweater so I went with
this one so this is so cute
I like this definitely wearing heels
with this definitely don't be doing the
most in this shirt because it definitely
if you move the wrong way
oh it's coming down it's it's coming
down it's gonna come down so make sure
you cover back right there okay okay so
this is the next item that it's called
let's say my name off the shoulder dress
if you guys didn't get the picture yet
your girl likes off the shoulder every
day and this is in a size medium
anything bigger will be too big anything
smaller would be too small and I'm so
the fact that I was kind of on the dot
with all these things that I picked out
because I'm usually just like a large
large large type of girl so me like
going on fashion Nova previously before
getting these things and I kind of know
my size from past experience because I
did get larges before and they weren't
entirely too big so I kind of know from
shopping on there and my own experience
just how it looks
so cute the model also had like some
clear some clear sandals eyecup so you
guys can see it's not going to much for
you know this area because I'm not I
don't not like a hippie girl so I don't
have hips I don't really have like a
stomach or anything but I don't have
hips so this kind of makes me look
straight forward just a little bit but
um it's cute and this area is not doing
anything for me either so I mean it's
cute I don't really worry about that
stuff I'm not really super ticular about
my shaper and dude but this is cute and
another thing I like about this is that
some of the show do things like with
that top that wasn't really a problem
because it was a stretchy like material
no not stretchy but it was like meant to
be warm and like cuddly but this this is
like mint from maybe like a club girls
night out or whatever and you want to be
able to move your arms so I like how
isn't I'm not like rush strip deal with
mantras that's what I'm trying to say so
you know like able to move around with
these and it's cute I like this like it
like it I like this I come moving it in
it
so this is definitely giving me Selena
vibes it just reminds me of Mexico I
don't know maybe the color I don't know
just giving me Selena honey like beers
yes
okay Phil this is the next dress this
one is super cute with sobre it's like
the same style as the other one but is a
different material this one's definitely
more stretchy so this one isn't that
angels cry angels cry mini dress not to
shirt and you describe mini dress and
this is in a size small so I feel like
if I would have got this in a medium it
would have been too big in a large of
course to my too large so that will list
the other dresses in medium this one is
gonna small so I don't know guys she
just kind of got a I don't know what
made me try this small but it's working
and this is just screaming girls trip to
me like isn't this feel cute like a
girls night out this is so freaking cute
I like how it you know cuts everything
nicely um with this one for some reason
it doesn't make them look as straight
down as the black one then I really like
this one and it's so comfortable it's a
little bit shorter than that black one
but you know and I think this one came
in another color I believe it was Green
in are like a turquoise or something
like that but this one is in a small
once again and this one's arms is the
same like the other one okay so this is
the next skirt this is kofta so set mini
points skirt or something like that I
know that this is a size small um it
does fit really well and another thing I
probably would not pair this shirt with
this only because this shirt is doing so
much I feel like this shirt should be
worn with jeans or I know just not this
it just it just looks like it's going
too much for me I wanted to pair this
shirt with the other pair of which
super-excited about get so nervous about
because I've never worn anything like
that before but back to this skirt this
car feels good I feel like it could have
been just a little bit tighter because
it does feel a little loose like if I
put my legs together it's kind of like
loose in the back but that's okay um
it's just a regular black skirt not too
much to say about it it's just the basic
black skirt I'm not sure if it's
supposed to have like a matching top I'm
not sure I don't know but it feels good
and is stretchable so if you're a little
thicker than even a small would also
work for you okay so the next carry I'm
so nervous about but let's just jump
into it never want anything like this
and I'm so nervous so let's see oh my
gosh no way no man what okay y'all know
this is me not this no oh my gosh and
it's that's uh y'all this is not gonna
work No
let me step back so y'all can see the
full look of this this is giving me
trash bag gold vibes definitely have to
be like this is giving me hefty and the
crazy thing is that is stretchy like the
reason I adopt this as a larger size is
because I thought it wasn't on a stretch
but obviously I don't know if they have
reviews on fashion over about this but
it's stretchy no I was so excited about
this okay so this is called the found a
boy girl I'm not finding no boy found a
boy latex maxi skirt and I got this in a
so looking on the site they did have an
extra small so extra small definitely
would have been my cup of tea
so I mean this is the skirt definitely
have potentially I was looking forward
to trying this skirt on but the medium
way way way too big and the small
probably would have been a little bit
too big and I see that they actually do
have an extra small so that extra small
probably would have been my best bet
definitely and the fact that it like has
the lace open in the light the leg open
in the back it's not hoping it
No Oh another thing this shirt is also
some fashion over I got this like way
way way in October sometime and this is
a size small and this fits so good like
the material
I wear this once and I don't know I
washed it
nothing happened to it it just feels
really good like the material is
stretchy but it still tight and
form-fitting and I just love this shirt
so yeah this is also from fashion novo
okay so this is the final piece take the
best y'all don't know how long I want it
like an outfit like this and somebody
because it just reminds me of like easy
season you know all I need is a little
head and some $3,000 shoes I love this
this is so comfortable like this is me
everyday like I'm such a not a tomboy
but I'm such a comfortable person you'll
never really catch me like I don't know
like dressing up rarely like meet al al
this is so cute I love this so this is
hot that Banzai biker set and this is in
a size small the smallest size they have
is an extra small so I don't believe I
could have got away with an extra small
it fits really well around the UM the
thigh area and this also fits if it's
okay but I feel like an extra small
would have digital well you know what I
don't know I don't know
is the back little does the back look I
guess it fits okay it has a little
little room in it but I could work with
that and also this white right here
that's on the way the last day it could
be an extra small wait let me put on a
jean jacket so that's how the model is
weirded on the picture on the fashion
all the website and this is so adorable
I just love this super comfy but it's
also like making a statement also nude
on any skin color looks bomb and I think
this came in I believe black and white
also if I'm not mistaken I know for sure
came in white and moved I just love this
stuff so much if they have I'm gonna
definitely go back online fashion Nova
and search to see if they have like
anything similar to this even if it's
like a body suit or even like a
one-piece I also like when it's not like
a crop top and it's like a one-piece
with the biker shorts so I'm gonna
definitely go check back and see because
I do have a session over credit so I'm
going shopping after this but I love
this this looks so cute super like
simple but like I said it still makes a
statement
so OMI Butlins be oh that's not
something similar to this in the mall
but the quality wasn't you know all that
but it was more of a cotton stretchy
material this one and just feels like
quality so you definitely tell the
difference between this and like
probably like another store you would
get it from but I really like this super
comfortable like I'm gonna keep saying
because they're so comfortable and so
mean but I love this I really do okay so
