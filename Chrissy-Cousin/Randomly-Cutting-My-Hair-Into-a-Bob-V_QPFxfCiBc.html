holidays for being gone for a couple of
weeks but as you I know I'm a full-time
student and I also making it to my
client and it's kind of hard to get out
here and film and edit but I want to try
to be consistent with you all as much as
I can and I just had a time to film
today so I'm gonna get this video I'll
see you all but if I am kind of m.i.a on
YouTube you all can up korrasami online
social media and that's Chrissy cuz I'm
always on snapchat and I'm always always
always talking to you all on there so
follow me at Christy cards on my
snapchat Instagram and Twitter
and if you all have seen this here
featured on my snapchat is not and Alex
where's Ben Darras this is actually a
company called culture company and I
will have all of the links of course the
website and all the beats on this hair
in the description box below but this is
a company from an independent owner and
I loved it so much she sweetest person
literally ever and he sent me this hair
this is her Filipino valuate hair in
inches 16 18 20 and a 14-inch frontal
and I did bleach the knots on this front
oh and obviously I did color the hair um
and why is the Honda Tara was the
l'oreal high color highlights in the
color magenta i've caught in my path
unit the same color so you are no good
eats with that but yeah i used to box
offense here took the color so freakin
pretty like it doesn't have any
brassiness orange miss to it kind of
like how my L
great to hear did I don't know what we
want to look fat but this hair literally
has the highlights of red burgundy
purple I don't know what happened but I
love it so freakin much it was so bad so
this is three Thomas in a frontal I
didn't use about two and a half bundles
I have about this much of hair left from
the 16 inch but I didn't use the full 20
in the 418 and guys literally this hair
is so pretty pretty I washed his hair
when I first with the l'oreal high color
highlights and now I watched his hair
three days ago and put some curls in it
and made it a middle part because I
initially had his hair as a side part
and then three days ago I just put this
here in the middle part so I line down
the middle part looks with this here but
you all know that this is a wig I don't
do so ins I don't do glue in any of it
so this is a full lace front wig and I
love it
so freakin much like it so pretty I was
so sure you all have a hair look
straight when our first straighten it to
get the curls with the side part and
it's straight and pretty well but I'm
going to try to show you it again just
see how that goes
but um I love this yeah I love the
length I said in my other review with
the early grades hair that I was tired
of blue hair so um this one is perfect
from wearing out it's super manageable
there's less here on this hair in about
three days so this is three day curls I
just put on my mannequin head and just
picked it up and put it on my hair and
just left out the door so that's what I
rise want to tear it holds a curl
beautifully yeah so can see what else I
can say about this here
Oh shedding them no no no no and I think
I cut the top of my lips
I'm not sure I don't know with this hair
literally this is how much I have
anti-depression this is the only brush
that I used for this hair I love my
beauty brush my favorite brush
for the third time so I have to do
another one but this is the brush that
I've been using since I use this hair I
haven't emptied it but this is literally
all the hair that came from it literally
I don't want you to see it it's
literally about 10 strands on the temple
again and look how these curls do not go
anywhere they just get bigger and bigger
in this pair does not tangle at guys my
gosh I'm not used to you know natural in
Haryana is either 26 inches for Bob so
