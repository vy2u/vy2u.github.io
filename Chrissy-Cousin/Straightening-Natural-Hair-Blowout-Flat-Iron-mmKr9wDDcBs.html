I'm finally back 1 another video and
it's on my straight hair routine so if
you want to see how I achieve to get
this look keep on watching
ok so this is my hair straight after
washing conditioner out I had
conditioner in the night before and I
rinse it out this morning and I have
previously dyed my hair so leave-in
conditioner and actually helped it so I
was happy about that and so just to show
you my hair I'm using the silk elements
to mega silky protectant and guys you
have to use heat protect me because
especially if your natural you want to
protect your curls so I just spray that
in sections in my hair then I'm gonna
start blow drying on high heat and with
a wide toothed comb I'm gonna comb
downwards and I'm just gonna keep doing
this throughout my head until I feel
like it's straight enough to be able to
go through with the flat iron
okay i'ma switch it up a little right
here as you can see this is the shortest
area of my hair and this is because I
cut off a lot of heat damage a while ago
so instead of using a wide tooth comb I
want to use a smaller one and this is
just gonna help me straighten out this
area a little bit better
okay after I blow dried my entire head
I'm gonna go out with my hands is
ceramic flat iron and even though it's
not good to have it on the highest heat
setting that's what I had it on and then
I'm just gonna divide my hair into tiny
thin parted sections and I'm gonna do
that throughout my whole head and to
straighten my hair I'm going to use the
chase method I'm gonna use this Diane
straightening brush I just call it a
clamp brush but I'm gonna put that about
an inch away from my hair and then I'm
gonna put the flat iron in front of it
and I'm gonna chase it with a flat iron
and that's gonna make my hair silky and
straight and I don't like going over my
hair more than twice with the footer and
I'm just scared of heat damage so I try
to avoid that so I go slowly over each
section and if it's not as straight as I
want it I just do one more pass
okay so once I was done with the flat
ironing process I just saw that my hair
needed to be trimmed just a little bit
and I don't have a specific routine with
trimming my hair and I rarely do it
which is not good but I just cut
straight across and I tried to make my
hair as even as possible
Oh
