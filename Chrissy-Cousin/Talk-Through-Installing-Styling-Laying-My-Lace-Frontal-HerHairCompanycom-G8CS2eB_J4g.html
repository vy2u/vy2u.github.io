filling okay
I need one more chance one more chance
cuz you won in the million you sound
like a leer i'ma need a full-page letter
it owes and welcome back to my channel
so today's video is going to be a
tutorial on this look right here
uh well partials tutorial but um I did
make a video on how I colored this hair
and also how I got it to look like this
because I don't know what I was doing
with this way when I first got on camera
and you all are gonna see that if y'all
are wondering where this hair is from
this is from um a company a well-known a
very well known company and I want to
see what the hype was about this hair so
I was fortunate enough to get my hands
on it I'm working with her hair company
to kind of test out this hair and
honestly guys I've worn this hair for a
day so far I wanted to get straight on
camera and show you all what I did to
this hair couldn't wait any longer and
as you can see I'm not in 28 26 inches
this is a 16 inches it's their Brazilian
straight hair I will kind of have a
snippet of the how the hair looks coming
out the package in my coloring tutorial
but I don't want to ramble too much in
the beginning because I want to show you
all what I did to this area guys look at
this like like wait what
oh it's what from so like seriously this
is no glue no tape no sewing this is
honestly just like the elastic band and
that's all that's really all I know how
to do at the moment if you all want to
see me experiment with other techniques
for lace frontals or maybe the got to be
glued method tape method well probably
well sewing now because I do have braids
out of here you got you all are going to
see how the braids look but if you don't
want to see other techniques on how you
can secure your wigs then just let me
know yeah this is the hair is not giving
me um any problem so far but like I said
I had it in for a day but this hair is
so freaking beautiful look at this color
if I've been at leashes here for a
really long time
this color came out so beautiful and it
did not break off any of these ends okay
this is okay I'm just in love with this
color I'm sorry I know but I want to get
straight into this video I'm sorry if i
ramble too much I don't like to update
you all with one on so once again this
is her hair company food bundles of 16
inch and a 16 inch lace to frontal so
yeah thank you all so much for watching
this intro and let's get straight into
is hair
um this is the wave right here I struck
pill this is a wave right here I
constructed it like this I will have a
video of me showing you all how I
achieved this color and I'm also going
to show you all how I kind of style this
on my hand because I honestly do not
know how I want to style this way I know
what a lot of my other ways I did like
the sleek middle part bone straight look
and I kind of don't want to do that with
this hair I want something different and
I always do two bundles with my lace
frontals but I wanted this to be a
little bit more full and I wanted a
different look so I did go ahead and use
two in about 3/4 of the 60 inches and of
course the lace frontal but I like for
my hair to look natural and kinda not
thin but a natural fool but by this pink
sixteen inches you all if you're not
already aware sixteen up to maybe 20 or
22 inches three bundles is more than
enough hair but the wefts come longer I
don't know um
from my knowledge I know that the
shorter limbs do have longer buffs than
the longer limbs because when I had 28
inches and 26 inches my lips were so
much more shorter um and that was with
Aliexpress brands but also when I
received 16 inches and 18 inches from my
clients that I make eunuchs for their
web swear so much more longer so um that
is something I didn't realize so this
unit was going to be full anyways even
if it was with two bundles just because
that 16 inch rough was much longer than
the 28 inches and 26 inches 2 bundles
that I use with my other wigs so I just
finished constructing this wig I did
plug the frontal and yeah that's
basically all I did in I flat ironed it
with my cheap flat iron and some silk
infusion so yeah I'm gonna show you all
how I put this on my head how I decide
to styling because I'm just going to be
going with the flow with this video so
we'll see what I come up with so yeah
stay tuned and let's get straight into
the video oh and another thing I had to
start braiding my hair well I didn't
braid it I got someone to braid it for
me and I posted like all her information
on my snapchat but I have to start
braiding my hair because my hair was
starting to get so freaking like growing
out so I couldn't do the slicked back
anymore no yeah I know I used the
Gorillaz not and then recently I started
using God to be glue gel just like all
my edges to help them lay down but like
it was still not it in like three days
it started to lift and my hair being
curly it started to get like poofy back
here and I just
hated washing my hair every three days
for my way to just slick it back down
getting fur to heaven again and again
and Plus that gorilla in that gossipy
glue Joe was kind of starting to dry out
my hair by me having to comb it through
my head and have it to lay down into a
mode it was literally starting to dry
out my hair and I realized the different
texture in my hair because it was
becoming so dry and my hair has never
felt like that even when I was
transitioning so I put a treatment in my
hair and I also conditioned it before I
got to bring it and I just blew out my
hair and then she braided that community
did amazing job she did a straight bag a
lot of my clients even asked me um how
am I supposed to braid my hair when you
make my units and this is the perfect
base like no baby hairs out nothing and
coming out should have such a great
Ionians turnaround and I haven't had
braids in such a long time but if I
really good to get my hair braided and I
think that this will last so much longer
it I know for a fact it will last so
much longer than my um then my slip down
my wig does have an elastic band on here
and I also have the little flaps in case
I decide to glue down my hair or um put
tick lace frontal tape on it or even if
I choose to put got to be glued on it
just for it to hold two days so the
flaps right here is what allows me to do
that when I first made my units I used
to sew the elastic band at the end of
the UM front row so therefore it will
just pull that part and I wouldn't be
able to have the option to have the
little sideburns or any of that so
therefore I love the little sideburns
out right here so I'm gonna show you how
that looks when I put the wig on this
color is so cute I was tired of like I
asked on my snapshots I was to send me
some pictures of hair colors that they
want me to do and I've um
save their messages but I kind of have a
visual visual of the pictures that they
send me and oh my gosh I cannot wait to
try those colors I'm not going to say
what colors y'all want me to do but they
were so beautiful and I'm still letting
the child sent me those pictures so I'm
going to keep in mind for my future
tutorials and reviews on what colors you
all want to see and styles I'm super
excited about that so when I put on my
wigs um I'm just gonna do a beginning to
end on how I would apply my wigs on a
regular day since I did kind of change
um some of my techniques so it's a whole
little bit like this I grabbed this Bart
and II and then I hold my I'm gonna put
the lace against my forehead in the
middle of my forehead and this is how I
look in the bag with the nicely pan and
then I just slide it like this it's just
cute okay so I don't have any type of
baby ears
um the five or anything but I kind of
want to do a side part I think yeah I
think I'm gonna do a side part
see this is what I'm talking about with
the sideburns if I was to put some glue
or something
I will be able to I will be able to just
glue that down and to wear my hair like
this
so um how are we gonna do this
these baby hairs are all in my face Oh
I'm going to use my own curling iron
which is set back in the part that I
want
oh this is thick
i Loki wanna put like um got to be glued
right here but it's not lifting so um I
don't think I'll need to but I'm going
to get some of this chi chi helmet hit
extra from hairspray I got it from TJ
Maxx for $3 299 so I'm going to spray
that on this toothbrush cause I don't
want to spray it and then it likes it
like um helmet hits my my friend's
little baby here I'm going to spray guys
and I'm gonna just kind of move the baby
I got the way for now for now cuz I'm
gonna define them later
okay so now I'm going to get a razor and
try to raise it out some of these baby
hairs and I don't want to grab a whole
bunch of 80 years I'm just taking the
comb and whatever comes out is literally
light I don't know but just small little
strands I learned this from experience
so I'm gonna well let me get a clip so
I'm gonna clip message back and we're
going to focus on the boys here's my
grab a wall down like these and just and
the hairs came out like this my messages
from a beauty supply store Lee remember
now I'm just going to comb the baby here
down on a spray some of my helmet head
I'm going to just call my baby hairs
down
okay so now I can get this spray and
spray it on the fly ways because we
don't want those flying everywhere
okay so this will conclude the video I
hope that it was very helpful if you all
have any questions I will try my best to
respond to as many people as I can in
the comment section below um a lot of
people ask me to do a tutorial on how I
pluck my frontals
um that will be coming soon I kind of
want to do a class on how I do that but
I just have to find the time to kind of
set that up because my um techniques are
literally changing every time I make a
new way I learned something new so I
don't want to just throw out there a
video of me plucking a unit and then I
learned something new I want to be able
to take up as much knowledge as I can
and then eventually then I will just
share my knowledge with you all and for
those who want to learn how to pluck
frontals but um that's just for those
who have always been asking me about
that on snapchat on my Twitter on my
instagrams asking me to update on how I
put my friends'll now and it's really
not a big difference but I do learn new
techniques every time I meet new weeks
so I want to be able to just show as
much as I know already
and just put out there rather than just
put out a new video every time I learn a
new technique if you know what I mean so
just want to save me time and editing
time and just get me prepared for that
video that she I want to see but yeah
this is the video of the her hair
company this hair is super soft I'm
going to say that I did cut the wefts at
the top just so that only super flat
innocent remain beautifully so um I
really love the texture of this hair um
it's not comparable to Aliexpress
vendors at this point you can tell that
the grade of the hair is different I'm
not sure where this is but I will find
out and I will list it in this video but
the hair is very beautiful and I love
this it looks so natural I love this
color on me for the summer is something
different so yeah thank you all so much
for tuning in stay tuned
my next video I will be doing more
things with this hair but yeah that's
basically all thank you all so much
watching and don't forget to Like
comment and subscribe and I will see you
all in my next video make you it maybe
next time we'll do things different
maybe next time around you learn baby
next time around your listener recognize
my word since then with Bevers you had a
thousand second chances maybe next time
next time next time
