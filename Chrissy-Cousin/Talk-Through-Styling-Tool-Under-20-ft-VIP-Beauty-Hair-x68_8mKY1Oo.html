hair tutorial on this new iron that I
have and I want to introduce it to you
guys so make sure you keep on watching
if you are interested but straight to
the details on this hand you guys hate
waiting so straight on into this hair
this hair is from an L Express vendor
they were super sweet they are so kind
but I was sent four bundles and a lace
front oh I only use three bundles
out of the four and also the least fun
so I constructed this units myself and
also I colored this hair so the hair
took the color really well I used a door
and out you guys will probably hear this
again throughout this video because I
kind of got to talk through kind of but
don't be annoying because I'm just
letting you guys know the hair um they
take the dye well I pretty bleached it
and then I also use the dye so I'll see
what I use in a video but the specs on
this hair so far so good
the only two problems I have with this
hair is the front so the frontal has
these little like phrase to where they
the hairs just start frame up and it's
so obvious I had to put so much
hairspray to let it lay down and I hate
that but I did pluck this front oh and I
also installed this onto my head and the
other thing about this hair is that it
tangles so tangling is an issue that I
think tangling is an issue because of
the density of the hair so the hair is
really heavy as you can see the curls
are really big and that's a good thing
but I don't know sometimes when the hair
is super shiny it tends to get sticky
and I don't know I just don't like that
I don't like the fact that it's shiny
here but sorry the shiny hair always
seems to get tangled
just sticky for some reasons so that was
the two issues I had with the hair
shedding really wasn't a problem but
hopefully that stays that way but it's
just the tangling so the tingling keeps
up of course
the shedding is going to go on top of
tangling and then it's gonna cause a big
issue to where the hair will start
shedding very badly so hopefully that
holds up but other than that I just want
to show you guys how I got this style
sort of kind of how I cut these bangs in
here so yeah it's nice they make sure
you keep on watching okay so this video
is kind of gonna be like a get ready
with the knee not really get ready with
me with makeup but like get ready with
me with my hair so I feel like I'm
running out of hair styles to do I'm
kind of missing my natural hair and I'm
just not in the mood for doing we right
now so I don't know maybe soon I'm gonna
be taking a break from wigs and stuff
for me wearing them right now just
because I need to revamp my imagination
with hair styles so this color was
achieved with a door I will have those
colors in this video if you guys are
wondering how I achieved this color and
the hair also took the color really well
so that is one thing I wanted to say
about this hair but um like I said this
is a curling iron I will be using I
usually use my con your curling iron but
I've been I've been shopping a lot in TJ
Maxx Marshalls Ross and they have these
super affordable products so I ended up
I usually get like my makeup stuff from
there but I ended up just going into the
hair out and y'all like they have so
many high high quality products they're
like I saw the macadamia um conditioner
shampoo you know that stuff that you see
in Walgreens and it's like 20 something
dollars they have that in TD Max and I
end up ended up getting
credit card for tedium X because I'm in
there all the time so why not let it
help build credit let me take this
jacket offices never mind so I ended up
just getting a credit card with two
magics because it can help build your
credit even more and I'm always in there
so why not
so I saw these curling irons they had
another a smaller inch I think a inch
under the smaller inch and then this on
so I ended up getting this one and the
smaller inch one under this one and I
never really was able to try it so it's
just been sitting in my little
compartment in gauges collecting dust
but this iron was like this iron was I
think 17 dollars I'm gonna go my receipt
because I'm still happy but I think this
Carlin Carlisle was $17 so that's super
affordable if not it was cheaper so I'm
super excited about that compared to my
baby list kind of iron that was like
$200 so that's a major difference but I
would really want to see how this kind
of art works and it doesn't look like it
wants to work well with me right now but
I'm gonna make it work because this is
such a still so let's see and I also
don't know how I want to style this hair
I know I wanted a deep middle part and
not a deep middle part I wanted a deep
side part because I've been rocking the
middle part for long enough and I get
tired of hairstyles so fast so and and
that's why I went for and I cut a little
layer in the front but I think I may cut
this thing a little shorter just so the
layers can look super pretty with the
curls
so I may go too deep bang cuts
and I find it so surprising that a lot
of people still ask me to do curling
hair videos a lot of people say they
learned from my curly video and then a
lot of people still like all can you
slow down just a little not like oh my
gosh I have a hundred videos on here
with me curling my hair but I mean if
that's what you guys want to see then I
don't learn another thing about this
hair I realized on the frontal the right
here you can kind of see this keep
spraying up and these pieces are shorter
and it's really annoying me because I
have to spray it down and during the day
it just flies back up so I don't really
like that those hairs are really short
right there I'm not sure what their
color I don't know if it's called beard
I think that you just when it's on the
wealth beards but they have really short
hair in the frontal so I'm not too happy
about that but I'm feeling with it I
don't really like it and then the other
thing this hair is really heavy so if
you like it really thick bigger then
you'll probably like this but it's all
in the shade near side but it's really
heavy and sometimes when the hair is
really heavy and may avoid the curls
from holding so and when the hair is
really shiny the curls may not hold as
well so that's another thing
I really don't want all these girls are
coming out the fact that I've been using
my babyliss curling iron for so long it
just seems like it's so much easier to
so much easier to style that way because
this is getting all my nerves like
turning it it's my curls didn't even
look like this in the other video and it
took like half the time oh but back to
this color the color I used a door I use
mainly the purple dyes but but I
bleached this hair - hi blonde and then
when I put the first color on it it was
probably I don't know what the color was
but I'll have it right here and put the
color that I put on that first it made
it kind of red so if you see a red tint
that's what it's coming from so I ended
up one over there red tints before I
made the wig and then I just put a
darker purple on it and that's why it
looks plum and kinda burgundy and then I
left a piece of a track not not dyed so
that's at the top before I have my
frontal on and that's it's kind of
giving it that and red right here the
red right here and the purple down here
and I really like that look it's super
cute and these curls you know these
curls are not that bad
I'm kind of into the loose curl thing so
maybe if I just put some Flex around in
here it'll look good and I'm gonna just
do this other side and you guys to see
what I got going on
it's not curling the ends how I want is
kind of leaving on your street no and
I'm the only thing that's kind of
helping it is the layers in the hair so
I feel about this
like it's so complicated and this
freaking thing right here is so freakin
far from the actual curling iron it
makes it see like the hair just
literally literally slides off and I
don't like that at all
you really pay for what you get so and I
haven't seen any tutorials or anything
on this curling iron
I haven't searched it I haven't looked
for it so if it does worry I don't know
how to use
okay let me just show you all with the
baby let's play this is a huge pizza
here I'm gonna show y'all how says this
one works and how that's the other one
works
this is so much easier so
look at this and this is like not me not
even putting the hair in it all the way
not this part but Eva's compared to
these curls I'm gonna just curl the rest
of my hair with the with the Babyliss
curling iron pose I got big yell I need
this took alessa's
wait okay so this is the end result
okay so these are the finished curls if
you guys were wondering you know I do
not like this lettering
I mean it's curling iron so if you want
it just let me know because I won't be
using it anymore it doesn't work it
doesn't hold your crown you're super
complicated this thing is just too much
like too much drama too much confusion
I like minimalistic bangs effortless
things like this too much yeah I just
don't like it
good other people may be able to work
with it but for now on my con year one
is still working for me that one's still
a little complicated but I may just be
sticking with my baby this one for now
so these are the curls that I achieved
with the vet I don't even think I was
doing my hair for 15 minutes I don't and
I like these things so yeah that's
