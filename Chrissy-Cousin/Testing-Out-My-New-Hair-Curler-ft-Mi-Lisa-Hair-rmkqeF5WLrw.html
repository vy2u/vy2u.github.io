channel so today's video is going to be
another curling video so you guys
obviously aren't tired of these videos
because you guys constantly ask me about
them so this will be another curling
video I will be using a new tool that
I'm super excited to introduce to you
guys because I want to see how it works
on this hair specifically because this
hair doesn't hold a curl and I'm trying
to find the perfect thing to get this
hair to hold a curl because the hair
curls beautifully but it doesn't hold it
it holds it for a couple of hours but
I'm gonna get into that because I'm
gonna kind of talk through this video
I'm gonna do something different you
know what I mean let's get straight into
this because I don't want to ramble all
cuz you guys hate that so thank you okay
so the new tool I will be introducing to
you guys is this baby right here it's
nothing like you guys have seen on my
channel so far um you guys know that I
use my Qi iron before and I also use my
curling iron bike on here but um this is
actually the baby list pro prima 3000
and it's supposed to be a straightener
and a curler and I've never straightened
my hair with this but I do want to see
how this hair holds a curl so I'm gonna
use this in combination with my flexi
rods because I've never ever ever curled
my hair and not use flexi rods and this
was curls with flexi rods so um we're
gonna see how this how this holds up and
I'm not gonna worry about my baby hairs
or anything right now so I'm gonna do
that at the end just so I can just have
these curls setting in here and I'm
going to show you guys how the curls
look in the morning okay but like I was
saying this is a wig I constructed it is
three bundles in a lace-front zone um I
still have the elastic band on it and
this is on the one two three this is all
sports for 10 degrees yeah the only
thing about this sweater iron is that
it's so freakin expensive it was close
to $200
I can go to Ulta a lot and I already
have a video on how it fits right my
hair but I want to try to be as detailed
in this video also the only thing about
this flat iron is that it's close to
$200 and I am Ulta a lot so I had
rewards so I got it for like a hundred
something see if it's worth the price I
did use this iron on some of my other
bundles and the curls were so freakin
pretty light so freakin pretty actually
you know what I'm gonna lay my baby
hairs first just because I don't like
how this is laying on this so I'm gonna
take these out lay my baby hairs first
with the tape with the wrapping stuff
and then I'm gonna go back and curly
when you put the hair in it like you can
lock it
how's my pocket so once I put the curl
in I don't have to worry about me really
holding on tight on sugah
so the curling iron so it's like that
extra security which I really really
like I still do really love Miconia
curling iron but if this can hold a curl
in this then definitely something that
I'll be using more than that of their
curling iron because the other one did
not hold the curl for me but I think
it's just this hair but we'll see
you guys know about this bondage from my
previous videos and this is the glow by
Dave on it no I'm gonna take my shower
and go to sleep and we'll see how these
curls look in the morning so I'll see
how it holds and everything so stay
tuned for good morning so now I'm just
gonna take these flexi rods out it is
1:30 now so I had these in my head for
more than 12 hours so hopefully they
turn out just as good as I want them to
so I'm just gonna let these fall out and
I was able to go back and look at the
specs on my hair so this is me Lisa's um
it's four bundles actually it was a 20
626 24 24 in a 20 inch lace frontal and
like I said the carry is super soft I
really didn't have any issues with its
sheddy envelops one thing and tangling
this hair really did not tangle and I'm
looking into this mirror start to like
what is she looking it but honestly this
hair really had no problems
tangling but my only issue is with the
curling part so I'm gonna come back
unless you all know how these curls hold
up throughout the day but even when I
had coat my hair with the other telling
iron these curls were not this tight so
I'm pretty excited to see that and um
but yeah like I was saying the only
problem so far but the hair was that it
wasn't holding a curl and you guys know
that I live for a bone straight hair and
I live for big voluminous bombshell
curls because I have enough videos on
here showing how I get those curls so I
obviously like them I don't know how to
cut bangs so I didn't cut this side
that's probably another reason why it's
not you know fall it into layers but I
don't know little seam
okay curls I see you with the finger
comb comb so obviously I'm not gonna
wear them like this but I'm gonna take
this off too
and I they try a new method with my run
so I don't think I stayed at that last
night so it's actually glue it's really
sticky
let's look at that so far that's a wear
it for the rest of the week I kind of
want to try to color so I don't know I
make color this hair that will be super
exciting but I'm filling the black let
me know what you guys think below how
you guys like this look what you think I
should do to my hair neck but the curls
are super simple and they're bouncing
right back
and I think it looks good some of what
you guys think in the comment section
below
like I said the fat is not even sewn
down to mid lead 10 hours later I'm
coming back it's literally 11:30 right
now I did the test I'll let you guys be
the judge maybe I should put on the jean
jacket give me all my makeups all over
the place my concealer under my eyes is
gone but I just wanted something I'll
hold up against her hair but I'm gonna
let you guys be the judge I don't think
I really have to say anything honestly
so this is how looks after holding with
the flexi rods for 12-plus hours curls
though it's not really my cup of tea but
it this is what I got from it so you
guys um decided to try this hair make
sure you let me know how your curls hold
up if you decide to get it but this is
this is me you know I'm gonna be honest
with you guys and honestly my frontal is
sliding back so I don't even know if I'm
gonna be able to wear this hair for much
longer because my frontal is literally
coming off you see this nah but I love
to hear it's just the curling parts
though so make sure you guys like
comment and subscribe if you enjoyed it
and I will see you guys in my next video
bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
