and welcome back to my channel if you're
new to my channel welcome here but as
you see in the title let me just give
you a run-through about my hair history
before you all start judging me on why
I'm cutting all my hair off while most
of it so as you all see if you watch me
already you all know that I review hair
and 99.9 all the time on my channel I
have hair in my head so when I'm
constantly doing reviews or when using
reviews if I decide to do a side part or
a middle part I have to take out the
braids wash my hair will condition it go
dry it do treatments and all that stuff
and take care of my hair while still
putting other hair in my head and that
gets really overwhelming and stressful
it's just another thing on top of making
a wig and all of that stuff so I wanted
to make my life easier and while making
my life easier I will be making my hair
healthier and this is something that I
then wanted to do and I've been holding
up on it but I finally got the courage
to do it because it's the perfect time
all the ways that I will be reviewing
from now on will have a lace frontal or
closure so this will be protective
styles for my hair to transition and get
healthier and grow out fully natural and
that is my dream and another background
on my hair
is I have been relaxed before about
three and a half years ago I cut off off
my relaxer I was probably in like the
9th or 10th grade but I cut off all of
my relaxed hair and I was natural and
I'll leave pictures and clips about that
in this little section somewhere or a
slideshow or something just to show you
all how my hair used to look and it was
healthy but it still wasn't to the
potential that I know my hair can be and
I was young and I'm not gonna say young
and dumb but I was young and not like
aware of certain things I shouldn't have
been doing to my hair as a natural
curly-haired girl and I mean this is
something that I finally wanted to do I
just know people are going to be like
well why are you doing this and why are
you doing this but it's my hair and it's
what I choose to do so hair is not the
world hair is not life like it's just
hair like there's seriously other things
in the world going on than to worry
about what someone's going to their hair
there's bigger issues if I want to cut
my hair I'm going to come out here but
there's a reason why we could and I'm
not just doing it to be crazy I do want
my hair to be natural long full and
healthy even if it's not long I want it
to be healthy so that's my goal that's
why I'm doing this and I want to show
you all on camera how this process is
going to go and hopefully we can have a
journey in the future of me showing you
the progress in growth of my hair health
so with that said let's get straight in
to it
my hair is legit
breaking and falling out as I'm combing
my hair like it's so damaged I haven't
shared my ends and forever ridiculous
like if it doesn't go back long I
wouldn't even like really care I just
want a healthy hair this looks healthy
like your probably doesn't even look at
will be on camera but a lot of people
are always like why would you even
consider cutting your hair and I'm like
do you not see like this doesn't even
look presentable the only thing like my
hair is good for is in that top not bun
and that was like barely making it the
top top one makes it look decent but
even that it wasn't making the cut I
just know that it could look better than
this and seeing like now it's looking
good like it looks good
I promise is not so thin if I was to
flat iron it it would look so stringy
the top of before in the bottom would
just being oh my god
okay so this is my hair washed and with
a little bit of conditioner in it my
hair is so rough I just need to cut this
off my gosh your heart we can work in
sections firs driftin on by you know how
I feel you know happy I'm going to I
don't even know how chard I'm cutting is
I did not want it off so I'm gonna cut
it like so right here like super short
even if the front isn't short I know I
want the back short
that's it
so crazy
Wow
some odd reason like I'm getting a
little emotional right now like and I
don't know
so it's like a little paper cut we have
going on here
just hair it's just hair it's just hair
is just here
okay so this is super weird okay so now
I'm going to go watch this and come back
to you all okay so I'm back I want to
cut this shorter I want it all to be one
length I washed it with Tresemme mousse
Chur and I have Aussie moist conditioner
in my hair right now
I'll put pictures or video clip in there
to show you how it looks
okay so I think that this is the most
that I'm going to get done today like I
obviously don't know what I'm doing to
my hair like this is a big adjustment
and change but I'm super excited I did
it I actually really loved it I think
the only way I can see myself wearing it
is in a side part but I know I'm going
to experiment with it more I just wanted
to show you all this process I just
can't worry about it I'm just going to
wait for it to grow out and we'll see
where it goes from there but I will of
course be keeping you all updated and
showing you all the progress with the
hair and I'm super excited I may even
end up cutting it shorter I don't know
but if I do I will come and show you all
all of that and everything so this is
the final result all I do is put gel
right there on the back is not twisted
either
I'm just going to keep doing this maybe
put some conditioner in it just to
moisten it up more or something but yeah
I like it that's all that matters
yeah this is so weird this is crazy so
new I'm so happy I did it I don't regret
not one thing but that's all for this
