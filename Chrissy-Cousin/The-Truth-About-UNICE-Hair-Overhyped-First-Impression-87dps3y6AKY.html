one of my other videos I did oh my gosh
and my hair looks the same what the free
guys whatever ever wear this shirt
stands whatever now to the review she
woke up in a room like she owned it
she knows you shutting it down shut it
down walk away the ruling owner
she knows she shutting it down hey Niles
welcome back to my channel so today's
video is going to be a hair review so so
many people have been asking me to
review this specific hair vendor off of
Aliexpress they're probably one of the
most well known vendors on YouTube so a
lot of people have reviewed them and I
always thought this company was so hyped
up and I always thought people were just
saying their prices were so cheap and so
affordable that they were saying that
the hair was good just because but let's
just get straight into this hair so this
vendor is from Aliexpress the vendors
call unis hair I know you guys most
likely have heard about them and I've
been wearing this hair for a couple of
days and so far so good
I really don't have too much complaints
to say about this hair honestly but a
lot of my followers also saw the picture
that I posted all my Instagram and all
my snapchat I kind of show you guys the
hair before I actually get on here and
do the review just so I can get a feel
of it but you guys have been asking me
to give you all the details on this
color and I didn't record that video so
make sure you stay tuned after this
video it would be linked below if you
want to see how I achieve this color
it's super simple and you guys gonna be
like oh my god like that's so easy and
it's finally coming up red right here
are like burgundy but it's actually not
when he gets in the Sun and super pretty
and it's just what I was going for so
I'm super happy with the color and all
of that stuff and the details on this
hair so this is three bundles
I was sent four bundles but I ended up
putting three just because honestly the
hair was just a little thin it was on
the thinner side it was thinner than
most of the hair that I reviewed on my
channel but it was straight also but
also I've had straight hair that was
much thicker than this but this is three
bundles and a front so I usually go with
two and a half bundles two bundles and a
frontal but the frontal was actually
really nice the frontal was pretty much
pre plucked not so much but
nearly as dense as other French hills
that I've reviewed so that was one thing
I really liked about the hair and the
hair was super soft the only downfall of
the hair is that it's thinner than other
hair that I tried I've tried many
vendors I know what I like and what I
don't like and just this being kind of
on the thinner side asks for shedding no
this hair honestly doesn't too much
um I've been using this brush since I
wore the hair and this is pretty much
all that I got I'm not sure if you can
see tangling no this hair does not
tangle and I'm thinking that's because
of it being kind of on the thinner side
I did construct this wig myself um
didn't take no time it was so easy this
hair I'm gonna keep testing it out
sooner or later I'm gonna put some curls
in it I'm not too sure how I'm gonna
feel about the curls just because like I
say this on the thinner side but I don't
know the hair is super stuff and I can
just run my fingers through it all day I
also cut some layers in the front just
because the 20 inch frontal was really
long and also my blenders bundles are
really long so I just wanted something
to pretty much frame my face so I just
cut those little layers in the front and
I think they look really really good but
other than that I really want to show
you all how I achieved this color and
that'll be super quick you guys will
have that like that so I'm gonna have
that video linked down below if you have
any questions about this hair just let
me know pros the hair is super soft I
like the shine of the hair and the cons
is just there being kind of on a thin
side and me having to use three bundles
and it's still not being as full as I
want but other than that so thank you
all so much for watching don't forget to
Like comment and subscribe and I will
see you guys in my neck
video bye guys okay so I'm back I think
I wanna put some curls in this here
let's see how that turns out
let's see how that turns out
but I mean I can't give a full review if
I don't curly all righty
like what
if this hair doesn't have too many
layers in it so I'm not too sure how
it's gonna come out but he all said
y'all like when you asking me you know
have mistakes so whatever
hey okay yeah and it's nothing like
natural curls cuz of the density of this
hair so we don't work we're gonna work
with week I can't believe I wore this
shirt and one of my other videos like
what the crap
oh wow supposed to do like throw it away
and it's just getting like cooler back
well this probably last a week but it's
literally just getting a little bit of
breeze in New Orleans so I mean why not
and I got a shirt from boohoo I've had a
trial at all for them those you guys I
got this shirt for Black Friday so check
that video out but y'all be throwing
away clothes after wearing a one time or
at all cuz I don't I'm really felonies
code though I see you unisza I see you
cry these are so freaking cute these are
so cute I think I want to make um my
review over now cuz I like these curls
better let's see how they hold though
hmm that's the real question
with my color I was going for the UM
what's her name the lady off shrimp I
was inspired by her color so I was like
let me try that I can pull it off she
can pull it off
I can pull it off so I went to the store
and got the color once again click the
link below if you want to see that video
I love these girls oh my god these are
so freaking cute what oh my goodness oh
my gosh okay I was not expecting this at
all
I was expecting this to look so flat
well it is kind of flat but I was
expecting it to look so thin
and shucks what
okay so this concludes the review I
guess I'm so pleased with these curls
I'm gonna pink roll them and see how
they turn out but other than that I'm so
happy just came out so cute um I
actually have to go somewhere so I can't
pin curl them right now I'm gonna pin
curl them when I get back home and I'll
