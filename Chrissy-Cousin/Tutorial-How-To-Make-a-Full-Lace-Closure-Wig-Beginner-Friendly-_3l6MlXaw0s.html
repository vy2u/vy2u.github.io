I make my lace closure units so this is
the first thing I use and it's just a
mesh cap from my local beauty supply
store and I love this one because it
comes with an elastic band so you don't
have to sew an extra elastic band on if
you don't want to but I did of course
and this is a candidate tents on Amazon
and this is the exact size of my head so
this is a size 20 inch Candis head and
yeah I have a small head so I don't have
to worry about really measuring my head
I just know to align this as if it was
on my head and it's gonna fit perfectly
so I think that that's a good investment
so get you one of those and I'm just
showing you all where I secure my cap
just to make sure is not moving or
shifting and this also helps me to make
sure I'm not um sewing the cap tight to
where it is gonna be too small on my
head so these cans make sure everything
is secure and now I'm going back with
these stick pins and I'm just you
carrying this lace closure on to the net
and this is a medic he to make sure that
everything is going to lay flat and
seamless so I put them in the top corner
to own the lace closure and then I'm
just going to secure them in the back
also just to make sure it's going to be
flat that's the major key of making sure
your lace closure unit lays flat with no
boat
one
okay so once all of that is pinned down
you just want to pin that hair just to
make sure it stays out of the way and
not getting hooked into your needle and
thread so the first thing I start off is
sticking the thread through the lace
closure and pulling it through the loop
as you can see what I did and um I would
usually stick the needle through the
lace closure and then wrap the thread
three times around the needle just to
make sure it has like a little knot in
the beginning to make sure it's secure
but I'm so used to doing this that I
didn't even do it in this video but I
did do it towards the end so if you want
to see what I'm talking about just keep
on watching but this is just very
repetitive you want to make sure that
you're sewing the loops close together
also just to make sure that there's no
lumps or bubbles in between the closure
and also it would be a flat base so now
I'm going to show you all what I'm
talking about I'm getting towards the
end and you just want to stick it
through pull it through the loop and for
the last one you want to stick it
through the closure and wrap it three
times around you needle and just pull it
through just to make sure it has that
little knot and it's not going anywhere
okay so then all you want to do is cut
that excess thread off and now I'm
chewing all just how closely I sold
together and also how there are no lumps
and bumps or levels in between anything
and it's laying very flat which is if
you want and it's not going anywhere so
now I'm going to start sewing on my
bundles and once again this is the
peerless here from Aliexpress and their
Peruvian straight and I'm showing you
all that I am double Ft the first two
bundles or three no but I think it was
the first two bundles just to make sure
that I could fit as much hair as I can
on to this lace closure unit so what I
did here was I started right kind of
where that black line is and I'm going
to do it to the other black line that's
kind of dividing the cap and I stick the
needle through the wealth and wrap it
three times and pull it through and it's
going to make a little knot just to make
sure everything is
secur and then you don't have to do that
for the rest of the hair you just want
to stick the needle under the left and
then just pull it through into a loop
and you're just going to do that until
you get to the other side
so once you reach the other side of your
cap all you want to do is stick the
needle through the weft once again like
we did in the beginning and wrap the
thread three times around the needle and
I'm going to show you that right now and
that's just going to make sure that that
side is secure so when you flip over the
hair if you are doing the flip over
method and not cutting any wealth it
will be flat and it won't kind of shift
or anything so the key is just to make
sure that everything is flat and
seamless and I'm just showing you how
I'm flipping it over to the other side
and securing it with a pin making sure
that I'm sewing on to a straight line
and all you're going to do is stick the
needle through the thread again and pull
it into a loop and you're just going to
do that until you get to the other side
and it's just going to be very
repetitive
so once you flip over the hair you just
want to make sure that you saw in the
needle under the left and through the
thread to make the loop and like I said
this is a repetitive so if you have seen
my previous way making videos these are
the same steps that I follow and this is
also for my beginners who really don't
know what they're doing so if you know
these basics then I will leave a time
somewhere and a clip just so you can
skip through and see me working on
further up on the way and you don't have
to watch these same steps over and over
but if you are a beginner this is very
detailed you can kind of get a general
idea of how you're supposed to be you
know sewing all your tracks
okay so now I'm finished with my first
bundle and as you can see it's pretty
straight and yeah I felt that pretty
good haha but uh now I'm gonna start
sewing towards the top of my hair and
this is what I'm going to start single
Westing so this was the third bundle
I sold the second bundle double wefted
and I started sewing in the third bundle
single WestEd and as you can see that's
pretty much the space that I had but
we're not going to worry about that
you're not gonna see it so I'm gonna
still that fourth bundle on okay so for
the fourth bundle we're gonna do the
exact same thing stick it through the
cap stick it through the weft and make
the knot around the needle just to make
sure it's secure so everything is super
repetitive like I'm saying
but um you're just doing the exact same
thing you're just doing it single WestEd
so you get a general idea of how to do
the bottom of your wig if you don't plan
on single wetting if you want to and you
have the time to single wet four bundles
go ahead go for it but I didn't have the
time this day and I've been doing good
what I'm double wedding the bottom half
of my wigs and they come out still flat
and all that so that's what I just do
for my preference but if you want to you
know sing a wet dick go ahead and do it
but um once again I'm not going to say
too much right here I'm just going to
show you all how to do the top of your
hair just to make sure it's laying flat
and that you have no lumps towards
getting closer to your closure because
we don't want lumps or bumps or any of
that so just see how I do this and then
we're going to goes to the next step
okay so for that last track before you
end your wig making you want to start
sewing that on to the lace closure so as
you can see I'm not going all the way up
into the lace closure but I'm just
sewing onto that white little band that
is kind of on the perimeter of the
closure yeah that's what I want to say
so you just want to sew your lash track
on to the lace closure and it's going to
be super flat you're not going to see
any white or necked or anything when you
lay that close your down so yeah that's
what you want to do
okay so now you're finally done with
your wigs everything after this is super
easy all I'm gonna do a noun is just cut
that excess net off of my wig just so
you can kind of see the color of the
scalp and not Fleck net under so yeah
and it got a little stuck right there I
don't mind that try to prevent sewing on
to the candidate because it can mess up
the head but I'm just showing you how it
looks on the inside and also that unless
again I would come in super clutch so
this is where you want to be careful at
it so you just want to hold your hand
kind of how I'm holding my wig and just
cut carefully make sure you are not
cutting too close to where you sew your
clothes your own because it will unravel
but other than that once you get all
that done you can sew another glass
again on I did so because I wanted more
security but yeah once that's done
you're done with your wig and I also
want you all to stay tuned for part two
of this video I will be showing you all
how to lay and apply and slay in style
you're at lace closure unit so if you're
interested in seeing how I do that stay
tuned but yeah that's basically all I
want to thank you all so much for
watching this video I hope it was
helpful and I will see you all in part
two bye guys
commissioner so this is another one that
I use if I run out of any of my other
awesome oyster petitionary and I ran out
of this one so I'm using another one by
policy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
