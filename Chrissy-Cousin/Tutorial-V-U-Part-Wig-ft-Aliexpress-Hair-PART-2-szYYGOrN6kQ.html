will need check the description box
below for all the products and where you
can purchase them at and of course you
need your thread needle Styrofoam head
and these are just some sewing pins to
sew down your weaving cap and this is
the weaving cap I prefer to use it's the
best and it's also adjustable so if it's
too big you can always tighten it and
then I just pre thread all of my needles
just in case one breaks or one runs low
on thread and this is what I'm talking
about when I mean you will need those
pins to pin down your cap and just make
sure it's centered right on the
styrofoam head so your measurements on
your side part or middle part will be
just right okay so what you want to do
is get your needle and stick it in the
ends of the wealth so you're going to
stick it through the wealth not under
the hair stick it through the well and
make sure you pull it and then I don't
like to start sewing my hair at the
bottom like the nape kitchen area I like
to do it kind of on a slant so I start
at the ear area and then I'm going to
stick it through the cab and through the
weft again and just to make sure it's
secure after sticking it through the web
I'm going to wrap you can see the part
I'm picking up I'm going to wrap it
three times around the needle and pull
the thread through and that's going to
make sure my hair stays secure on the
cab and it will not go anywhere
okay so as you can see the hair is
secured on the cap for our base and what
you want to do is make sure you do not
sew on the elastic band because the
elastic band allows you to loosen the
u-part wig and to tighten it if it's too
loose so just make sure to sew above it
and not on it because if you still on it
you won't be able to adjust it how you
want to and as you can see now I'm just
putting the needle through the cap and
sewing it under the weft I'm not going
through the web anymore it really
doesn't make any sense to because of the
knot we did in the beginning and you
just want to keep continuing doing that
until you reach the other side of your
head
and before I flip it I'm going to secure
the end - just like I did the first time
so I'm going to stick it through the
West wrap the thread three times around
the needle and pull it through and when
you see me flip it over I'm going to do
the exact same thing we want to make
sure that it lays flat and that it's
secure that's the main goal of a u-part
wig to make your lay flat and to be
secure because we don't want it to be
followed or loose and all that so after
I pull that knot you can see it's
secured just like the other side and
what you want to do is flip it over and
do the exact same thing and right here
I'm just showing you how I sold above
the elastic band
the little brown part is the elastic
band so I'm just showing you how to sew
above that
and as you can see here I'm sticking it
through the wealth once again are
wrapping the thread three times around
the needle and then pulling it through
making that knot and all I'm going to do
is sew across the head just like I did
the first time and do that until I get
to the other side of the cap
and as you can see on the middle part of
the cab I started to run out of thread
so all I did was stick the needle
through the weft just like I did in the
beginning and I'm going to get the
thread and wrap it around the needle
three times pull the needle through the
threads and that's going to secure the
hair that we previously sewn and
everything so when we get the new thread
and needle and continue sewing the hair
on everything that we did before that
will be secure and sturdy and it won't
be going anywhere as you can see right
now
and I just continued sewing and as you
can see I've reached the other side of
my head now and what we're going to do
is just keep sewing upwards this is my
bang area the side part of my hair where
the bang will flow so I just keep sewing
upward a little past where I flipped the
hair last time and all we're going to do
is just flip that over and continue
sewing to the other side so make sure
you secure before you flip by making the
knot then you can continue sewing to the
other side of your head once again
okay so as you can see I flip the hair
and reach the other side once again so
instead of flipping it and continuing to
sew to the other side I'm going to start
creating my bang so I'm going to just
keep sewing upwards until I've kind of
reached where I want more hair to be
than the other side and this is just
starting to create my side part shade
and you'll see how I do that and then
we're going to flip it and just continue
sewing to the other side again
you
so here I finished my first or second
puzzle I'm really not sure but as you
can see I ran out of hair but all you
want to do now is if you have red left
on the needle what you want to do is
just get your new bundle and just stick
the needle through that weft and just
continue sewing after you knot it down
like we did in the beginning so you just
want to make sure it is secure and just
keep continuing to sew
okay so I just continue to so back and
forward to each side and then all I'm
going to do is keep doing that until I
reach the point where I have enough hair
on my right side because my right side
is where my bank is not so to make the
side part one side has to have more hair
than the other side so as you can see
I've reached a point where I had enough
hair on the side where my bank isn't
going to be and I'm just creating the
shape of the side part and also how much
leave out I want and some people use a
marker to create how they want that to
be but I've done this so many times I
could kind of eye it and see how much I
want to leave out and the shape that I
want but this is kind of complicated but
I do this because I know it works so
after I sew my leave out area out I
leave this space because I just want to
make sure it lays flat and that I have
the perfect shape and side part so after
I saw the shape of my leave out out I
just go back and fill in the space area
and this just makes sure my hair is
laying flat and I don't know if other
people do this but I know I do and it
works for me so I just keep joining you
don't have to do it but this is just
what I prefer to do
and I'm just gonna keep doing the same
thing I've always been doing making sure
that I wrap the thread around the needle
pulling it through and making that knot
to make sure it's secure and just
continue sewing and back to the front
and I'm just going to keep doing that
back and forth back and forth until I
filled up that space
okay so I finally finished sewing that
space up and all I'm doing is putting
the needle through the well for the last
time and filling the needles through the
thread and making that knot to make sure
everything is secure and what I'm gonna
do is after I cut the needle also the
thread I'm going to tie three knots once
again just to make sure everything is
extra secure and that my hair is not
going anywhere so you're going to see
I'm going to cut it and then I'm going
to just do three extra ties to make one
last knot
and we just want to cut off that excess
thread and when you flip that part over
you're done with your wig and your part
will be laid your wig will be laid
so now all we're going to do is remove
those pins that we're securing our cab
and after we do that we're just going to
cut away all of that excess cab that we
don't need so all I'm going to do is cut
straight through the middle and that's
going to create where my leave out is
going to be and also you want to cut the
sides and also the back but make sure
you do not cut off the elastic band and
as you can see this is my shape I call
it a u part wig but it's actually a V
part wig but you know same thing kind of
and just cut this off and then you're
ready to sew your hair on and this is
the braiding pattern that I use for this
wig this is also what I do when I use a
middle part or even a closure and it's
super simple I do not know how to braid
professionally or anything but to make
sure Italy secure and super flat I just
saw the braids onto each other and this
is the only head that I'm leaving out
I'm not leaving out anything in the back
or the sides or even the front and after
that I just sold the wig onto the braids
and it lays super flat and secure and it
just works for me this is what I've
always been doing and it's the perfect
size for my head again this is the Ross
pretty hair that I did an initial review
on a couple videos back so you can check
that out in the description below and I
just hope this video helped you all and
