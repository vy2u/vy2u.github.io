for like like I don't even know what to
expect I don't I'm just so happy that
we've come this far and it's just the
moment of truth like that's just what
you do doesn't do this Washington oh
let's let's do it I thinks I'm Cyrus is
loud first of all but I just washed the
conditioner out I left just a little bit
in it I always leave just a little bit
of conditioner in my head just so it
won't over dry you know okay so the
product I'm gonna be using it's called
the main choice crystal orchard biotin
infused styling gel so this is how it
comes I got this big old jar this big ol
jar from Walmart but I didn't even know
she had like a line of products I know
she had the main choice of vitamins and
my sister tried those and I actually
bought two bottles of those they words
$25 each I didn't I didn't use them yet
but I do plan on you think those on to
talk more about that in my next video
whoo but it's this is what I'm going to
be using it's this is a styling gel from
my previous experience with
transitioning I will say that custards
butters smoothie whatever like those
things just didn't work with my texture
for some reason I just don't understand
but if I use eco styler gel that's the
only thing I really knew about back then
was eco styler gel that's the only thing
that with my curls are like we act to
and hold a curl because I don't have
that defined curl patter when I just
wash my hair I have to put some type of
product to get that defined curl so I
drew
or to this and like the texture let me
show you guys hey there we go it's like
a jelly now that my hair is longer I
have to kind of use a Denman brush and
get to work it so oh my girls okay so I
just empty this is the part about it I
don't know where my other water body is
but I'm gonna use this just in case my
hair gets a little dry I have a
scrunchie and I have just a few
butterfly clips to hold my short little
hair out the way so if you saw my hair
looks with little product little
conditioner is still more than halfway
wet and I'm going to apply the product
in my hair
Wallace way because if it's dry is just
not gonna look great I'm gonna start
from the bottom I want to work in
sections and just keep parting until I
get to the top
[Laughter]
the video for right now until the
morning after my first impressions about
this product I'm gonna give it a 8 out
of 10 as now because my curls are
popping my hair is kind of damp still so
I want to see how it dries out then I'm
gonna give my final review on the
product but I'm gonna come back in the
morning show you all how this looks I
don't know if I want to put a bonnet on
it or I don't know I don't want the
curls to like mess up but I think I'm
gonna pick it out in the morning and
also I don't know if I'm gonna do my
edges so no I'm not gonna do my edges
right now I'll do my edges if I decide
to style it in the morning the first
product I ever used since Aussie and
yeah I can't wait to show you all the
finish results so I'll see you guys in
the morning
all right so good morning oh wait it's
not morning it's all right so good
afternoon so I've been sleeping on my
hair I've been sleeping all day but I'm
gonna just take my bonnet off actually
scan it to see how this one I look okay
so these are my curls after being slept
on all night and mornings I mean I don't
even know what to do in my hair I'm not
used to like actually wearing my hair
out you all know that I did protective
styling so I don't know the curls are
fully dry Wow
I'm shook they're still defined also so
I'm really happy about that so now I'm
just gonna play around with this and
also another thing is I want to thank a
style factor for reaching out to me to
try their products I've literally seen
these products in all of my beauty
supply stores in my area everywhere I
thought they were gonna send me one to
try but they actually sent me and
there's a box of edge control so you can
edge control you control you get an edge
control I thought that the edge controls
were actually like this color and I'm
just like how is that even possible to
put on your hair and it's this color but
actually they're not once you take them
all off then this is how they looking
here and all of them even aren't this
color so like they're actually just
clear so that was good to know because I
don't know how I want to set color stuff
on my feet okay so I'm gonna try the
lemon candy spin okay so actually I'm
gonna do the yogurt in this one is how
this one looks and I'm gonna style my
edges as I go since I really don't know
what I'm gonna be doing to my hair right
now so yeah let's see what
I just want to get the full but I didn't
use the style factor edge booster strong
cold water beats pomade and this is in
the yogurt scent and inhale really good
out me having to put on a hair scarf or
anything so I'm definitely gonna keep
using these and the Eagle styler just
curls my edges up but this lady
and I did not have to put a hair scarf
on it or anything like this so I really
like this I'm gonna be using this and
most of my natural hair videos so far
just because I like how it works so so
thank you Sal factors for sending me
these products and if anything changes I
will definitely let you all know overall
this hair product I'm definitely gonna
read it a 9 out of 10 I just still have
some kind of white flakes and I think
that is because of my conditioner still
being in it I feel like if I would have
check out my conditioner and just left
my hair wet and then winning with this I
wouldn't have that problem but I didn't
do that so that's the only thing I have
these like little white little flakes
but you can't really see them so I could
see I'll let you know but I really like
this product I forgot how much it is I'm
gonna look it up on I'm gonna actually I
have to go back to Walmart so I'm gonna
look and see the price of it but this is
really good and if y'all have any other
suggestions of what you all want me to
try on my channel showing you all what
works in my hair and what doesn't leave
that in the comment section below
because I want to show you all just you
know what works with me if you have the
same texture as me or similar then you
will kind of know what what's the
outcome if you want to you know purchase
it I'm very pleased I can't wait to try
new products and just see what works for
my texture and also as you all can see
when I was finger closing right
err and working this product through my
curls at the top are looser than my
bottom ones so that's another thing that
I kind of have to be cautious about what
trying products is will they react the
same way as my bottom curls that are
much tighter than my top ones but I'm
gonna keep my eye out and experiment
with different things since this is a
new journey it's gonna be a lot of trial
and errors so yeah that's basically all
I have to say in this video I will have
another video just answering some
questions about my future plans with my
hair and all of that good stuff so make
sure you stay tuned for that video right
after this one but I will have all
information linked below and prices and
all of that stuff so make sure you check
that out and thank you guys so much for
watching I really hope that you enjoy
and learn something about my hair and if
you didn't check out my last video make
sure you check that out also I will have
that below so thank you all once again
