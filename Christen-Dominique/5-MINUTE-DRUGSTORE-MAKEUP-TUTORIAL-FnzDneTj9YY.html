today I'm going to be showing you the
most the most nails are actually about
to grow off of my hands they're so long
so today I'm going to be doing this
super easy it's so simple I can't even
begin to tell you this is the simplest
basica steak and upwards now our weight
this is the most basic simple makeup
tutorial I have ever done on my channel
this is the most basic simple makeup
table you will ever know in your
lifetime right now I'm going to show you
how to get this super simple look if
you're a mom if you're late for school
or did I say ARF
did I just bark or if you're a mom that
are set people if you are late to school
you woke up late hit your alarm grab
this makeup if you have five minutes in
your life you can do this look and you
can go out into the world feeling like
everything is okay I also give you some
tips on how to dress yourself in less
than five minutes and you're gonna feel
and look really good
so if you want to learn how to get this
look and if you happen to be running
late for school and watching this makeup
tutorial right now then let's get
started I would suggest that you
incorporate a moisturizer every single
day and night until your skincare
regimen so that's what I'm doing right
now it helps your skin just look a
little bit more lively even if you're in
a hurry
moisturizer is gonna help a lot so is
primer for the primer that I have today
I am going to use the maybelline baby
skin eye this is my favorite primer from
the drugstore
you'll see me use this in like almost
all of my drugstore makeup tutorials I
really need to find another one but this
is my favorite one by far because it is
silicone based this is a pore eraser and
it literally just sinks into your pores
and fills them out and it just any
texture that you have to help the
foundation just lay flat over your skin
next yes
so I'm going to use this l'oreal 24-hour
infallible roe glow foundation it's a
24-hour foundation that is crazy
coverage medium texture is air light
which I like and finish is radiant so
let's see how this where I'm going to go
ahead and apply some to the back of my
hand and then just apply it with my
fingers nothing fancy over here just dot
it on now if you're wanting to get ready
you feel like foundation is just too
much work or five minutes I would use a
stick that works as concealer and
foundation I haven't found a really good
drugstore foundation stick yet if you
guys know of one let me know in the
comments so I can check it out but I
haven't personally came ran across one
yet so or else I would have suggested
using a stick that does all in one but
like I said if you guys know one let me
know your figures are the best way to
warm up product onto your face it just
helps melt into your skin a little bit
better rather than using a brush or
something like that lets you have a
Beauty Blender go ahead and use your
Beauty Blender I'm just going to use my
fingers for this go right over my eyes
this part is very discolored it's
completely different color from the rest
of my face this foundation is very light
super light
what is the coverage if the meat it's
medium coverage so it's pretty good
coverage is not bad I feel like when my
skin tone is just even I feel a little
bit more put together this is the area
where we most need help like myself my
under eyes are very dark it's important
for me to use a concealer I'm gonna use
this Maybelline age rewind concealer and
I'm just gonna dot it on if you put on
too much concealer when you're in a
hurry it may be hard to believe in
because then it'll be just a huge mess
so if you just do small dots it's a
little bit easier to work with when
you're in a rush or you just don't have
much time this Revlon age rewind that
I'm using is neutralized it has like a
yellow undertone which works well with
my skin tone the sides of my nose are
usually pretty red in the sides of my
mouth are usually dark so I always put
concealer in there
our just to brighten it up okay so now
that we have concealer we look a little
bit more alive so now I'm just going to
fill in my brows honestly if you have
brow powder this is my go-to brow powder
it's from Wet n Wild and I got hooked on
it when I bought it for a drugstore
makeup look back in the if I don't even
know how many videos back but I still
use it to this day every single day when
I do my brows so whatever works easiest
for you sometimes using a powder is a
little bit more easier than using a
pencil I feel like for me the fastest
way to do my eyebrows and realistically
if I'm in a rush using drugstore makeup
is to use my wet and wild own powder I
think I don't use the stencils all uses
the powders and it has a wax but I don't
use that either but I just take these
two shades right here and I'll just fill
in the parts of my brows that are sparse
I feel like powders are easier to
maneuver I wouldn't suggest you guys
trying new products when you're doing
your makeup really quick that can get
really messy and just aggravating so
don't try any new products whenever
you're in a rush just stick with what
you know and just enhance your face as
it naturally is because trust me I've
done it several times it just gets you
in such a bad mood and it does not make
your situation better especially in a
hurry so don't try to do anything fancy
with your brows I'm try to carve them
out or anything if you don't know how to
do that fast my skin and brows are done
I feel like I'm almost there and this
only probably took me three minutes
maybe after my brows are done I'm gonna
go straight in to my eyelashes I'm going
to go ahead and curl them before I do
anything to them because they naturally
just grow straight down and there are
some extensions that are sticking
straight up so want them to be one with
each other just curling your eyelashes
is going to automatically make your eyes
look a little bit more awake and wide by
the time you're done with your brows
your foundation and concealer should be
done setting into your skin so now we
can go ahead and go in with a powder and
I'm taking my Maybelline fit me powder
and I'm going to set the cream on to
face so just patting it lightly like
this not sweeping it I'm going to Pat it
gonna help the powder sit on your skin a
little bit better especially be a
textured skin and your eye sweat we're
gonna Pat it on to our eyelids as well
because our eyelids crisp ah this is the
hundredth time it hits again I'm going
to also go ahead and Pat the powder on
top of my lids my lids are very oily so
anything that I put that's a cream on my
lid is going to leave these crazy
streaks on my eyes so I have to set my
eyelids so I'll just set that with the
same powder I'm using all over my face
so this is going to be the easiest
makeup you could ever do in your life so
I'm going to go ahead and take my
mascara and start to coat my lashes with
it going to take my Maybelline colossal
spider effect mascara I accidentally got
some mascara on my lid do not go in and
try to clean it while it's wet don't
even touch it don't look at it don't
think about it wait until it's
completely dry and then take a q-tip and
clean it off and now that we have our
mascara on I'm going to go ahead and go
on to the rest of the face I'm gonna I
don't have a bronzer amazed my
Physicians Formula butter bronzer to
warm up my face and this is one of the
easiest ways to bring some oh wow this
smells so good I think I've used this
before so so good what is the shea
butter it's with murumuru butter bronzer
kind of contour my face a little bit and
then it's going to also bring some
warmth and color to my face this is one
of those bronzers that you can use to
kind of contour your face because it has
like it ashy tone to it but it's right
in between where it could just give you
a nice warm golden glow which is really
really nice and so I'm just going to pop
it onto my cheekbones so this is going
to slim the face give it some dimension
and just make you look alive ready to go
outside and do whatever you have to do
so I'm just going to put this around my
temples this is adding just a little bit
more structure to my face and it's also
going to bring
in a lot of warm give me some color make
me look like I'm alive he's alive I'm
just going to go right underneath the
chin and then I'm just gonna take this
bronzer and just sweep it across my lids
of course if you don't have time and
don't do this something takes a few
seconds to do this anyway you're just
adding some dimension and just softly
defines all those parts of your face you
can even go down the sides of your nose
if you have time if you don't have time
I'll show you what you do that's what
you do and you're done
also have a blush from Physicians
Formula it's this really pretty one but
yeah I'm just going to put on a little
bit of blush does it take to long to pop
on some blush if you do want to add a
highlight just quickly grab an eyeshadow
palette this one's from a L'Oreal and
I'm just going to take this one right
here put it right here
Cupid's bow I'm just popping this on the
sides of my cheeks and my nose and if
you're in a big rush just grab a lip
bond that's going to moisturize your
lips and at the same time have a little
bit of color to it so it looks like you
try it a little bit on so just do
something like this you don't look like
they're arched so now you look fresh
awake you're ready to go I have my hair
in this ponytail grab one of these hands
and then just take a little bit of hair
twist it and then pull it down and it's
going to fluff your hair out and just
make it look a little bit more fuller
looks really cute and you could just go
about your day look put together and it
doesn't really take much time it's
literally only 5 minutes and I would
suggest you guys if you're in a really
big rush don't wear crazy colors if
you're not comfortable with matching
things easily wear something that's a
monochromatic easy white black stick
with those colors you can never go wrong
with a plain white tee pair of nice
jeans and some really comfortable cute
sneakers or cute sandals with something
simple that you're not gonna have to
really think about you just want to get
it on and go and not have to worry about
how you look like with a bright orange
shirt green shorts I don't know just
keep it simple lean and you will feel a
lot better at the end of the day
