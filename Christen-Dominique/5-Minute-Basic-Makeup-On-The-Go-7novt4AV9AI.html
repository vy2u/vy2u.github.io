today we're going to be doing
five-minute makeup when you're on the go
trying to get out the door really quick
and you want to look like a normal human
in the world
super easy no lashes just just you just
you being you this is what I do and I
need to like one out but I don't want to
look like a crazy mess it's literally
the easiest video I've ever done at my
channel anybody can do it this is a
universal look for anybody to grab your
my channel if you're not subscribed
already go ahead and hit that education
Bell so you can be a part of the quad
family and without further ado let's get
on with the video so I'm going to use
this toothpaste hangover three-on-one
replenishing primer it's just an setting
spray I'm going to go ahead and pry my
face right now even though I'm on a time
crunch I want my skin to look flawless
so the first thing I grab is my
hourglass advantage Foundation stick it
is amazing and super full coverage and
you can just slather it all over your
face
blend it in and you're ready to go I'm
in the shade nude looks like this and I
like how it's shaped it's like that
triangular shape so it gets into those
contours of your face they enter little
inner corners around the nose so I'm
going to go ahead and put it on my face
just little tiger stripes
and then I blend it in with a brush I
feel like the stick foundations blend
better with a brush into your skin B I
actually fake tan so my body is a little
bit darker than this foundation but this
is usually my color I'm going to blend
it down I'm going to pretend like this
is my skin color
some people can literally just go
outside the house with concealer and
they don't need foundation but for me I
feel like I do need foundation and I can
do this in less than five minutes but if
they take you a little bit longer then
you know you can skip it take concealers
spot conceal where your red and dark so
I just evened out my skin tone now I'm
going to go into my panda eyes and cover
them up I'm going to use my Holy Grail
my heart-shaped tape and light medium
I'm almost is basically almost done but
I'm scraping it literally I'm scraping
the bottle because it's amazing and go
ahead and work that and right here where
the inner corners are because that is
the darkest part of my eyes right here
and then take my little Beauty Blender
and you want to use the lightest touch
the lighter you bounce the Beauty
Blender on your skin the more coverage
you're going to get so now I'm going to
do my brows for my brows I'm going to
use the honest Agia brow Wiz in soft
brown and I'm going to take the spoolie
side just to comb through them and then
I'm going to fill in the sparse areas of
pencils the easiest way to get a nice
well-groomed natural looking brow and
you want to use a short little strokes
for the front like if you have a ball
front like I do but you don't want to
look like a sharpie eyebrows you just
want to use little tiny flicks with your
hand like that
and then you want to clean it through so
it looks fuller but it doesn't look
overdone so now I have my brows filled
in I want them to stay in place so I'm
going to take my Bravo conditioning
primer I love this stuff as soon as you
put it in your brow it will not budge
your brows stay in the exact same shape
you brush it into until the end of the
night just makes them look really nice
and well-groomed and it just looks like
he tried oh you tried and you succeeded
your browser gunpoint and it didn't
really take that long I want to do
something that's realistic for anyone
out there who's just trying to get out
the door and look like a human being and
not like a zombie okay so now that we
have our skin looking good everything's
even our brows on fleek
we are ready to almost ready to head out
the door I'm just going to set
everything in place because you're going
to have a big creamy slightly mess on
your face if you don't set it so I'm
going to take my Frankie Rose Pro
contour powder palette this yellow shade
right here and mix it into this shade it
comes together
I love yellows for my under eyes because
I feel like it just makes your panda
eyes just disappear so I'm just going to
tap it lightly on my skin and it's going
to give us the most coverage because
we're using a light hand whenever you
sweep any powders under your eyes or
anywhere on your face it's literally
going to move the cream around it's not
only giving you the most you can get out
of your product so if you use your light
hand tap it on your skin and we're going
to look so flawless you're going to have
so much coverage if you want that and if
you're not looking for a lot of coverage
or brightness under your eye you can
just use a translucent powder and just
set your entire face with that and then
you'll be good then even go like right
under here I would suppose contour it
naturally enhances the cheek contour if
you do this see and
so that's like a little hoc i'ma go
right in the center so now I'm going to
add some life into my face aka bronzer
I'm going to take the hoola benefit
bronzer and this little dome brush right
here that I love to use for bronzer just
fits right on the cheeks so perfectly
so I'm going to tap off the excess and
then just start to work that in circular
motions right on the cheek and I like
this bronzer right here for a contour
you can contour with this because it's
not too it doesn't have that foreign G
undertone to it it's pretty neutral it's
actually a really nice light tan looking
color so I'm going to take that around
the temples and then right on the
cheekbone do the same thing to the other
side just quickly and go down my nose
I'm also going to get right under the
chin right under the jawline because I
had Starbucks today and also when I'm in
a hurry I want to do I want to have
something on my eyes I don't want them
to be completely bare so once I set my
my eyelids with powder then I like to go
in a fluffy brush like this one and then
I'll just take the same bronzer and just
go in to my crease like this the key to
everything that we're doing today is
keeping your hand towards the back of
your brush remember the closer your hand
is the harsher the line so just go back
and forth windshield wiper motion you
only have five minutes so probably do
this week in seconds and done you have
dimension in your eyes you don't look
dead and then I'm going to go ahead and
take my all-time favorite mascara right
now all-time favorite right now it's
going to be can you guess the Maybelline
colossal big shot so I'm gonna go ahead
and take this and start at the very base
in my eyelash and then wiggle it back
and forth all the way up and not touch
your skin because I'm just going to get
everywhere if you do touch your skin and
you get mascara on your lid do not clean
it it's going to get so messy it's going
to be hard to get back from that so just
let it dry and take it off of the q-tip
and what I like to do is brush my
eyelashes in the wrong direction just
imagine you flipping your hair to one
side you always have it like that so
your hair is accustomed to going that
way but once you flip it over it has a
little more volume because it's like
I'm not used to be in this direction
same thing with your lashes so I brush
them to the right and make it like sweep
tout like what's going on and then I
brush them to the left and they're like
whoa and then I brush them straight and
they are so lucky luckier than a
squirrel's tail and then you move zigzag
motions back and forth motions I already
look so much more alive just with my
lashing like that in the longer I should
write question to the left don't move it
anywhere
don't try to clean it and spin get messy
I'm gonna let it be the usual real life
situation right now I'm just going to
let it be let it sit and get dry so I
have my q-tip it is dry and we are going
to script it we just have to do is just
tap in that little bald spot if you are
extra I need some highlight in your life
I'm going to go ahead and do this part
for you I'm going to use the huda beauty
3d highlighter palette and I'm going to
take this clean highlight and just grab
it right on my my cheeks and it is
intense intense highlight dab it dab it
I'm going to take my all-time favorite
and natural lip color this is the Mac
dervish lip liner I'm obsessed with this
color it makes your lit it's like the
most natural looking lip color but it is
just something to your lips
I'll show you give me a second so I'm
going to go ahead and actually put this
all over my lips so just fill them in
sitting on that overdraw your lips a
little bit color them in and they will
look so natural and plumpie with this
and then I feel like it needs a little
bit more of a pop just put this right on
the center take your eyelash curler in
your bag and just Chrome later and
they'll look a lot more perkier thank
