oh my goodness hey guys welcome back to
my channel so today I'm gonna be doing
this 5 minute makeup right here on my
face right now it's so easy so quick and
it's very fall all the warm tones all my
face are just giving me fall vibe I want
to learn how to get this look on my face
in under five minutes
oh this video is probably gonna be way
longer than five minutes that's because
I talk through it I explain different
things I were to cut out all the talking
and just did my makeup like I do an
Instagram it would be five minutes trust
me it's not hard it's very easy and you
can always take steps out customize the
way you want so it can work for you my
five minute is always gonna be your 5
minute so you can always work whatever
you want in and out of your routine I'm
just here to give you in spoke I know
you guys are gonna love this look it's
super easy and quick and before we get
into the tutorial don't forget to
subscribe to my channel and he founded
Education Bell so you can be a part of
the quad family and ignore my freakishly
tan it without further ado let's get
into you guys make my brows but I'm like
no cuz then I have to work around the
foundation I just want to slap it around
wherever out one I'm gonna take this
Milani prime shield face primer it's a
mattifying pore minimizing primer and
I'm gonna mix it looks like so and I'm
gonna mix it with the new Maybelline x2
Gigi Hadid tinted primer in light/medium
so thin it's just it's super dark by the
way whenever you work it into your face
it still looks dark alone and so mixing
this primer in because as you can tell I
don't know if you can see but I can't
yesterday as you can tell there's a
great job of that my whole body is a lot
darker than my face I'm just trying to
make it one even thing
can we talk about Gigi Hadid 's
packaging for her Maybelline collab it
is so beautiful it's a really pretty
pink and then she has the holographic
letters it was just really beautifully
packaged now we are ready for the
datian if I'm taking five minutes out of
my day I think I can definitely work in
foundation usually I'll do a stick
because it's a little bit quicker but
I've done that before and there isn't
any new sticks that are out so I chose
this instead I'm taking the cookie
cosmetics this is the first time I'm
using their foundation it's the HD
foundation in the shade for tw they also
sent me 45 see which is cool tone this
is more of the warm tone I'm gonna mix
them together I don't think this is
gonna be dark enough for my neck also
the brushes that I'm using today are
gonna be very affordable brushes so I
wanted to choose something that you guys
can pick up at the drugstore or that you
can get online for like four or five
dollars I'm gonna be using all of the LA
girl brushes right here very affordable
brushes again they're like four to five
dollars some of them eight dollars
depending on what you get and then these
are the maybelline ones that came with
the gigi hadid collab and then for my
foundation today I'm going to be using
the Real Techniques foundation brush
work that into my face I hope that it
covers up some things cuz that's some
some unwanted friends on my face this is
a nice brush no this is think I'm gonna
need a little bit more of that dark
color if I'm doing five minutes
obviously this is this videos gonna be
longer than five minutes cuz I always
like kind of talk through my videos and
explain the things as I go so that's why
this video is longer than five minutes
but this makeup can definitely take you
five minutes I'm gonna add more of the
darker shade I think this will work
better okay just to let you guys know
something very honest and real right now
both of these foundation colors I think
are a little off for me they're not
covering up very much so I'm not a big
fan of the foundation and definitely a
tip if you're going for only 5 minutes
stick with a foundation that you're used
to
don't try anything new because then if
you only have 5 minutes you're gonna be
a mess I just got a lot going on my face
and it's not covering it up so I'm gonna
move on to a different foundation I
think I'm gonna take the Milani
foundation so I'm gonna take this off
and then we'll be right back
so now I'm gonna take a concealer and
just go right underneath my
this is from Patrice and it's in the
shade light beige I'm gonna just work
that in with my finger I'm gonna take
this yellow Gore on the nose this is
from essence it's a color correcting
stick I want to use this to lighten the
dark spots on my face like around my
mouth when you're in a hurry your finger
is your best friend I'm gonna go ahead
and get started on my brows just so I
can look like human again I'm gonna be
using the cokie high brow angled eyebrow
pencil in the shade deep net these kind
of pencils usually can do so many
different things at once they can fill
in and they can create little tiny sharp
lines because of the cool unique shape
this is one of those brushes that are
perfect to grab when you're on the go so
I'm just gonna fill in really quick this
color is so perfect for almost any brown
haired girl brows are done so what I'm
gonna do is take these two shades right
here this peachy one and mix it with
this one right here and I'm just gonna
pop them on my eyelid if I only have
five minutes I don't want to like do a
whole bunch of steps with my eyes if
anything at all so this is one super
simple way to do that then I want to
work this color up into the crease so
that gives us that contour gives our lid
some color and then just take a blending
brush and just blend out the edges
really quick like so I'm gonna do the
other side you see how it kind of just
live-ins it up a little bit I like this
shade right here for like an everyday
kind of eye these shadows are so soft
and feel so smooth and beautiful on the
skin and blend out like a dream so I'm
very very happy with this palette right
here Maybelline usually has a really
nice little palette I just don't like
when it's all shimmer then I feel like I
can't really do much pinks give you this
flushed kind of youthful lively kind of
look so I like using those if I'm doing
something on the go I'm also going to
take it right underneath the lash line
this brush right here from the
and I'm just gonna work that down right
below my lash line now what I'm gonna do
is take this gel eyeliner in nude this
is part of the collection and I'm gonna
work that on the waterline just so my
eyes can look awake gangster eyes look a
little bit more healthy especially if
you have redness or irritated eyes or
sleepy looking eyes it's gonna make you
look a little bit more awake so I'm
gonna take this really pretty champagne
color in the palette right here take
that on line the inner corners of my eye
with this la girl brush in 206 mmm it
looks champagne E and the palate but
when you put it on it looks like a
really cool toned gold very very pretty
and then I'm gonna take the darkest
brown in the palette and I'm gonna use
that as a liner on my upper lash line
because la girl brush of course and 208
I feel like it's easy to do wings with
powders grab your brush look it out you
can be kind of messy with it because it
is a powder and you can move it around
then you can blend it out so it's not
something that's gonna be really harsh
on your eye she's gonna give you that
light little lift and you don't have to
bring it all the way in you just make
the thickest line on the outer edge and
then just leave it and again if you feel
like this is not a 5-minute step for you
you can definitely skip it because this
isn't for everyone
I have other tutorials where they're
super super basic the most minimum 5
minute makeup this isn't one of those
that I do have those types of videos if
you guys want to check them out coming
in a little bit and connecting the two
and then for the mascara I'm gonna use
the Maybelline lash sensational
doody Hadid we're pretty much done
wishing to contour a little bit and add
some color to our face I'm gonna take
the pixie X Maryam a kiosk
contour palettes this is such a good
palette it's amazing for highlighting
and bronzing and actually I like this
for contouring on myself personally I'm
going to take this la girl 106 brush and
I'm gonna take both of these shades
right here in the palette
just come toward these cheeks okay that
was a lot that was a lot but even if you
do this you can blend it out this is
real life right here this happens we we
do this you know you're just gonna have
really contour cheeks so the thing what
you want to do is blend upwards blend
everything up and just keep blending up
oh this one is so easy into the skin I'm
also gonna take it around my temples
like here such a beautiful color to
bronze love how it is blends into the
skin
take the cookie cosmetics contour
palette and I'm just gonna do a yellow
powder and it go right on top of my
under eyes just set that in place just
this bigger brush and this blend is a
whole face in okay once I've contoured
in bronze I'm gonna take a little bit
more bronzer because I like bronzer so
I'm gonna take the essence Sun Club
bronzer in lighter skin the NYX blush
brush and just work that on my cheeks
looks like we've got some oh this smells
really good and I take this lip right
here this is aaron from the maybelline x
gigi hadid collection this is a really
pretty color I love how this makeup look
it looks I think I'm gonna add a little
bit of blush this is the essence blush
in satin coral and then I'm just gonna
put it right above right here to tie
everything together once you're done
with that I would curl my lashes in the
car if you have time in chrome now but
I'm gonna take this and make it last
setting spray it's a 16 hour setting
spray from Milani let's make this makeup
lasts all day
