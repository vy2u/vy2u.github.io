channel so today I'm going to show you
how to do five beauty hacks using a
toothbrush I actually read up on this
and I was really surprised that you
could do so many things with using
household items I know it's so weird
but you're going to be amazed what so
the first thing that I'm going to show
you how to do using a toothbrush is
combing out your brows so when I was
younger I really could have used this
because my brows were cray cray they
were all over the place I didn't know
what to do with them I know my parents
we're not going to go out buy me a brow
gel they would not buy me any beauty
products when I was a teenager so I
really could have used this I had a
toothbrush and you know you can always
buy a clean toothbrush I suggest you use
a clean toothbrush guy I have my bomb
here and I'm using a body balm for my
brows and um let's see my brows are a
little brushed out right now let's just
mess them up a little bit
so I just messed up my brows for you
guys and so what I'm going to do is take
the brush and work it into the bomb and
now going to brush them out so just
brush them up and out like that and
they're going to stay in place all day
so it does a pretty good job I never
thought about using like a tooth brush
for this stuff you can also brush
through your brows without the bomb to
neaten up the shape so they look nice
and well groomed without using any fancy
brow gels just in case you're out of
brow gel and you can always use a
toothbrush so another thing you can do
is smooth out sore lips so just take a
little bit of the balm put it on your
lips take your clean toothbrush and
brush your lips in a circular motion for
about 15 seconds I can already feel my
lips are super soft so that's another
cool trick that you can do using a
toothbrush
and what I'm gonna do is take a little
bit of this hairspray and just lightly
spritz it on the brush my hands are
really slippery sorry guys just lightly
spritz it to have I don't have any
flyaways that is so weird I always have
flyaways here let's just make some okay
so I have a few I just jacked up my hair
so now I'm just gonna take my brush and
try it out see if it works
so I have some right here gonna so just
slightly come over your flyaways and it
seems to be working pretty well so
another thing that you can do is tease
your hair so if you don't have if you
don't have it so let's just say your
parents won't let you buy a teasing
brush because it's crazy expensive or
you just can't find your teasing brush
grab a toothbrush section your hair off
and just tease it like you would at the
crown so we're gonna do that right now
you just comb it downward so now that
you have all of this craziness going on
back there just do that let me turn
myself around yeah okay so now obviously
we have some volume to work with but so
after we've teased our hair like so just
grab your brush and we're going to tame
the flyaways this is so funny to me
right now I don't know what okay we're
just gonna brush your hair down okay
keep brushing my hair down oh my gosh
just actually grass grasps your hair
really well oh my god that is so awesome
so you can actually create this really
nice volume using a toothbrush I would
so grab this instead of a teasing brush
maybe I'll start using a brush
so if you tan like I do I self chant
every other Sunday so I'm always having
like this blotchiness around my neck and
around my arms so what you can do is you
take lemon and baking soda mix them
together and when you have the bristles
of the brush
it's the perfect tanning smoother so it
smooths out your tan it evens it out and
yeah you should try that and you'll
notice that your tan looks like it never
faded and I always get watching this
like around my chest and around my my
hand my arms usually around here and it
fixes it pretty well so I did try that I
read up on it a few weeks ago actually
and I've been playing with the stuff so
so if you want to see more beauty hacks
that you can use with random things
lying around your house let me know in
the comments or random things anywhere
I'll look them up oh you're going to
brush your teeth so if you don't have as
we don't have it so I have a few I you
know what brushes work best the ones
that are like a dollar and you're going
to take your clean toothbrush this is a
not clean so we can try out this
what is this all of you please now do
not stick your toothbrush in it because
I just did that not what I was supposed
to do all right so that's it I hope you
