hey guys welcome back to my channel I
feel like two different people at the
same time 2018
vs. 90s makeup boom I really like both
sides of the face honestly I can wear
this I'm actually gonna wear this look
tonight this look is way more rounded in
smokey and kind of grungy and this one
is a little more winged out arched still
soft but very highlighted and just
something if you grew up in the 90s as a
teenager or as a young adult let me know
if I'm missing something or if I got it
right and on this side this is my
basically my everyday glam kind of look
this is 2018 for me so let me know if
you want to see more of these videos
because I think this is so freaking fun
you can't wear this look out I mean he
can if you want but people are gonna
look at you like you are awesome you
guys let me know if you want to see
different eras eighties 60s 70s I'm here
for it and let's look at the comparison
in these two makeup looks I think it's
so fun mom are you out there
I hope you're watching this grandma we
want to see how to compare towards each
other then let's keep watching don't
forget to subscribe to my channel and
hit that notification bell so you can be
a part of the quad family you know what
if I can bring my quad up I would but
I'm not that flexible yet I'm working on
it
alright so let's get into the video on
the 90 side they like to keep their face
SuperDuper matte everything was matte no
highlight nothing so I wanted to start
off with a base mattifying primer so
this is from makeup forever from
experience you have to kind of work it
in quick as it will dry in that little
spa and it will not move if you have
oily skin you're gonna love this on the
other side of my face we are gonna use a
moisturizing primer I'm saying this is
something that we like to use these days
because we all like hydration radiance
supple young youthful looking skin so
I'm gonna go with a Smashbox photo
finish primer Iser
primer and moisturizer in one so this is
one that I really like Smashbox the like
kills it on all the primers with this
primer on and I actually have really dry
skin so this works really great for me
for foundation I am going to start off
with the 90 side my favorite foundation
right now is these UA essential high
coverage foundation and I chose this one
to mix into this one just because in the
90s people kind of went for a lighter
skin tone just so their eyes could
really stand out so I have my new clean
fresh beanie blender really excited to
use it I always love using fresh Beauty
blenders and then I'm gonna mix sand
right in there just a little splash oh
my gosh I'm just gonna take a tiny bit
this is such a full coverage mattifying
foundation that I just thought it would
be perfect for a 90s look even though I
currently love this foundation but I
always end up using highlight and a
radiant spray or some kind of
illuminating spray along with it just so
I can bring back some of that luminosity
back into my skin but the coverage on
this foundation I've said it so many
times I'm sure you guys know how I feel
about this foundation by now but the
coverage is just absolutely amazing he's
good another favorite of mine is the
NARS natural radiant long wear
foundation this is a medium to full
coverage I can definitely build this up
to a full but it never looks matte or it
never looks super cakey or full it just
looks like your skin but thirty times
better this is a really good one because
you keep that fresh look and this is
kind of actually a really cool way to
compare makeup you can really get the
full effect of comparing from one side
of the face to the next you can see that
on this side it's covering up my
darkness it is covering up my blemishes
but you can still see it has like a dewy
kind of finish to it well my face kind
of sits and sets I'm gonna do my brows
brows are a very interesting one for the
90s 90s brows are very thin basically if
you ever seen Pamela Anderson in the 90s
Drew Barrymore I'm going to take the
precisely my brow pencil from benefit
because it has a very narrow tip and my
hair is just everywhere using a brush
through and naturally I have thin brows
so this isn't gonna be too hard for me
this is just basically embracing my brow
I think instead of doing that really
intense brow nowadays we're just keeping
it pretty fluffy and natural looking so
I'm gonna take the brow is from honest
Asya on this side because this is the
soft brown and I'm just gonna go back
and forth like this just to fill it in
super natural but I am gonna go a little
bit lower just because I do want more of
a full brow and I'm gonna use a softer
hand and it's not gonna be too hard to
create like a natural looking brow
because this is the color of this pencil
is just so perfect like a natural
effortless color for this brow so then
I'm gonna take foolproof brow powder I
love this powder it's so natural and
soft lifting on the brow and this is in
shade number 5 as well I'm just gonna go
over the honest Oz is a little too light
blink neutral shadow fusion and palettes
which looks like this I thought it was
perfect for this 90s look because
there's a lot of neutral color dip into
citrine which is this first bone shape
and just pop it all over the lids so
that we eliminate the crease see I was
looking at makeup in the 90s and it
looks like the eye shadow was very
minimal taupey shadows so it was a very
basic basically so I'm gonna take a
moonstone which is this shade right here
and I'm gonna use that excuse my nails
by the way they're so bad I'm giving
them time to just recover from all of
the fake nails I put on them for the
crease area and just basically all
around the eye
nothing was super precise with eyeshadow
back in those days or with eyeliner and
I'm gonna work that all over the eye in
general the eye shadow looks then we're
very rounded so I'm just gonna make sure
to do everything that I do here bring it
in a circle right on the lower lash line
okay so now that we have that color down
I feel like I put my dark circle back on
my face but that's okay at the end of
the
look you will see how it makes sense and
then I'm gonna take Tara right there
that really pretty brown matte color pop
that right on the lid and I'm just gonna
take that all the way around the eye
from the inner corner to the outer
corner just one big circle of eyeshadow
I'm gonna keep it pretty matte cool tone
neutral looking so I'm just gonna take
that black shade in the palette just
touch the the top of the lash line
because this is our super densely packed
brush you're gonna get a lot of product
right away so I actually put way too
much on there so I'm just gonna go back
to moonstone again and start to blend
this through and then I'm also gonna
take it on the lower lash line so bring
it around I'm going to use the dominique
cosmetics Lottie palette and I'm gonna
take caramel which is a warm tone Brown
a lot of these top shades are warm tone
and that's what's kind of trendy right
now and just work that all the way
through the crease I'm also gonna pick
up some pumpkin spice right there with
this eye I'm just gonna take this down
halfway I'm not gonna go all the way
through just going to take it on the
outer lower lash line I'm gonna pick
hazelnut in mocha and mix them together
but I'm gonna focus this on my outer V
and I'm not gonna take the dark all the
way into the inner corner of the eye
which actually works great for my eyes
because they are a little bit more close
together so I wanna keep darker shadows
towards the ends of my eye they make
them it just kind of balances my eye
shape out a little bit better and then
for the top lash line I'm gonna do kind
of the same thing I'm gonna use mocha to
trace out so these days we like we love
our wings I'm just gonna do a shadow you
can start off a little bit lighter and
then build and intensify this wing to be
super super dark so I'm just gonna do
that
I actually really like how that looks
I'm gonna take a little bit of this
right down on the lower
- or the inner corner I just want to
take vanilla cream and pop it in right
there just so this area looks nice and
right and oh wait I love this shade for
the inner corners the inner third just
all over the lid in general all right on
top of your concealer it just makes
everything look so bright and even it
looks so pretty and then we really loved
our glow these days we love our glow
there's no doubt about it I was thinking
of putting something right on the lid
but I kind of liked it matte like that
I'm gonna do macchiato
on the inner corners so this shade right
here which is really pretty as a
highlight - now I'm gonna go in with
eyeliner on this side stay pretty close
to the lower lash line and just start to
inch my way in there was no wings back
in the day maybe a tiny tiny flick but
definitely not a full-blown structured
wing it was very just natural and
enhancing the lashes kind of a thing and
then I'm gonna take this guy right here
and smudge the eyeliner back and forth
I'm gonna do the same thing to the lower
lash line I'm gonna smudge that
downwards I'm gonna make sure that
everything is just there's no harsh
lines and everything's kind of messily
blended out let me take the Maybelline
Big Shot colossal mascara in baddest
black this is the Shayla collab this is
actually one of my favorite mascaras
other than the LC one so I'm also gonna
do that on the other I'm just putting on
mascara in general because we are gonna
really work those lashes today you don't
move your mouth like this you don't get
points so getting on to lashes on the
90s I'd I don't really think that lashes
was a big things so I just got these in
from house of lashes they're very big
and PC just like I like them and flared
out these are the house of lashes posh
noir I think that I will have it listed
below since we're going for the all
matte very high coverage kind of look I
am just gonna go with the Tarte to shape
tape in light medium on the 20:18 side
of the face I'm going to use the
Mack water wait conceal it use a little
bit around the mouth the chin Cupid's
bow and right on the top so I'm gonna
start with setting this side of the
under eyes first because it's still kind
of almost it's almost dry but it's not
quite so this is a perfect time to set
the under eyes with translucent powder
so my favorite one to use is the Laura
Mercier translucent powder you want to
do this part kind of fast before it
drives down all the way and this is
gonna brighten prevent creasing and set
the under eyes so beautifully and in
pictures you're not gonna see a shadow
at all at the same time with this you're
not gonna have flash back when you're
taking pictures which is a big plus when
baking and that's kind of like a thing
that we do these days we like to bake
different parts of our face for the
other side we're just going to set the
entire face overall so for that I'm
gonna take my own wander Beauty powder
it's actually a powder foundation very
mattifying and full coverage makeup in
the 90s I noticed that there was a
little bit of a light flush of color on
the cheeks so I'm gonna go with the
Oprah flush and bone meets a very light
pink and then for this side we love to
contour we love sculpted cheeks noses
everything is about the contour nowadays
I'm gonna add some of the banana shade
right down the nose and on this side
also just add a little bit
right in here I'm gonna skip blush on
this side and just do a bronzer I think
bronzer is something that most people
tend to gravitate towards rather than
blush just because it's more
natural-looking sunkissed and we just
love that tan sunkissed look these days
I'm gonna take my NARS Laguna bronzer
and work that all over at this side of
my face on the 20:18 side of my face we
are all about the glow and I feel like
we're looking a little matte at this
point so I'm gonna take the Urban Decay
X Kristen LeeAnn Beauty beam highlighter
palette which is extremely glowy it'll
definitely blind your haters so I'm just
gonna run my brush through all of these
shades as v-two a 38 brush take that
right on top of cheeks oh my goodness we
go right above the brow bone on the tip
of the nose on the Cupid's bow and some
do it on the chin I'm actually skipping
that this year I want to intensify the
Illuminati in the radiance so I'm gonna
take the cover effects illuminating
setting spray and only keep it on this
side of my face we are done and then for
this side I'm just gonna leave it Matt I
think the powder did a really great job
of setting it in place so I'm gonna
leave it how it is and move on to the
lips so for the lips on the 90 side is
all about the berry Brown kind of lips
so I'm gonna go with the color pop new
lipstick and this is in the shade
friends and it's actually so cute I want
to put it all over my lip but we're
gonna keep it on this side this is
looking super punk rock so I'm gonna mix
a little bit more of a berry tone in
there this is from colour-pop as well
it's number 20 it's called 27 so I'm
gonna take that right on top they take
these you a lip liner in the cherem have
been using this a lot this is sable it's
really pretty I'm just gonna line on top
of that I'm gonna take the em cosmetics
French nude lip and pop it right on top
I'm gonna pick up this gloss in from
dose of colors it's called dolly
