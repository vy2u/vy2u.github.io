City for the first time and I'm in my
hotel room right now
today is just an exploring kind of day I
have Cesar with me originally was going
to come but here and I'm happy that I
did Blue Book the to explore together
and tonight there's a pre-party for
Generation Beauty so I'm excited about
that I'm gonna go ahead and put some
makeup on my face and do something with
my hair and let the day begin
by this time we were really hungry and
it was lunchtime in New York but still
breakfast in LA so we got a combination
of both and I like this little
concoction it was pretty good so we came
down to a subway just to see how it is
there's really no one here but I think
it's because everybody is going this way
do those doors right there
and I can hear the subway down
underneath we're fascinated by the
subway do they tell you guys that I
tried the toasted Grampa came with
heaven the needy project
so we are at the generation Beauty party
right now this one is for the BD content
creators and we've kind of all come
together get to know each other
sometimes already know each other you
just kind of hang out dance take
pictures it's a lot of fun and I was
kind of fascinated by the chandelier
light looking thing it is so beautiful I
just was like I just couldn't stop
staring out I was like a sparkly and
this is my husband Caesar he came with
me to New York for generation beauty
which I was really excited for there was
a breakdance performance that was really
cool to see and just being a generation
Beauty pre-party just reminded me of
when I first went to my first generation
beauty which was in 2013 I think that
was the first one to and I met so many
friends that I have right now that are
youtubers and I think that's why
generation beauty's so special morning
guys it's Saturday October 3rd and I'm
headed to Germany right now
November and I have to Lisa with me and
Maddie
we need coffee yeah Wow look at that's a
little like logging train so right now
everyone is walking out to the crowd
we're gonna be announced on a stage and
this part was really nerve-racking for
me I think more so because it was my
first time in front of such a large
crowd being announced on a stage but
luckily I had my other girls with me so
I didn't feel so nervous just walking
through those doors right there I was
like this is our first time in New York
a generation and I'm going to be
these lovely ladies
this is Katie
the nominee
Karen
please
this officially opens to nation beauty
this is our green room right here it
looks like there's a sandwich there's
food all right here goes fine right here
says yes fire and we all have our own
little cards and some balloons
hi French bread
here I'm just walking around meeting you
guys taking pictures chatting with you
it's so cool to actually meet you in
person
you guys are real humans which is so
crazy and honestly there was some
emotional moments between the both of us
because it's so crazy how you can have
this bond through Internet
I actually create a relationship and a
bond with each other and I think we're
all just really good friends and I'm so
happy to have each and every one of you
and to actually physically hug you was
something I can't even explain or begin
to explain it was just awesome right
here at this moment standing in front of
all you guys I thought I would have such
anxiety but you made me feel so
comfortable here we are in Times Square
we got to walk around and explore I
never thought in my life only in my
dreams that I would be in New York City
exploring Times Square and here we were
around all of these flashing lights it
was this beautiful amazing chaotic crazy
everything but most of all it was
memorable
I think this is so cute to get like a
Christmas and me like a memory to fit on
our Christmas tree this year this is
cute this one I just want to buy them
all I found
Big Mac store then there was this huge
Disney Store that Jaden would have loved
he wants to actually go for his birthday
in January and we are taking him when
it's super cold we promised him we'd go
and I've always wanted to experience
snow and cozy cold weather where you
have to layer and put on long boots and
a cozy coat so it'll be a lot of fun
afterwards we went to go eat at
Carmine's and it was highly rated on
Yelp and Caesar and I kind of lived by
up when it comes to finding restaurants
this one was really good we got the most
popular dish on the menu which was
lasagna and their portions are huge or
like family size somehow we managed to
finish half of that lasagna took the
rest home and got some rest though
because I had my meet up the next day
this is the first meetup that I've ever
done on my own so I was really excited
and nervous at the same time with such a
special day for me so I woke up
extremely early like a ridiculous early
time in the morning just to do like put
on my lucky hair extensions and then do
my makeup and spend the time on it so
that it looks my best I wanted to look
my best for you I had Patrick vlogging
for me because my disc kind of ran out
of space of so he blogged all of this
for me thank you so much Patrick I love
you and I got to meet you guys I was a
nervous wreck but you guys made me feel
so much more comfortable it was cool to
see that age range I had a beautiful
lady in her forties I had 30 20
year-olds teenagers even small children
coming up to me just telling me how much
they loved me and that we're besties I'm
like this is so cool like it's all
because of you guys that I'm in New York
it's all of because of you guys that I'm
even here right now still doing this you
you all inspired me so much and means so
much to me and it was the best thing
ever this weekend and I have to thank
you and tell you that I love you and I
don't know what else to say I'm kind of
full of emotion right now and I just
want to tell you that you're amazing and
thank you for everything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
