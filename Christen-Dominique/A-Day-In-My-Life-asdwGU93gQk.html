checking my Instagram and Twitter and
once I brush my teeth put my hair back
in a ponytail I head out for my morning
run I don't do the morning run every
morning but when I do I definitely feel
more energized and ready for the day now
it's time to take a shower and wash my
face I usually wash my face outside of
the shower because my face and lotions
are outside so I'll do that afterwards
and then I'll put on a hydrator of some
kind and work that all the way down into
my neck
now it's time for some breakfast and I
usually like it to be pretty simple and
I'll usually eat while I edit eaten edit
it's time to get my face ready for the
day and although I don't do my makeup
everyday when I do I like to use stuff
that does good things to my skin before
I get started I have some exciting news
for you guys I have the privilege of
being Pacific as 2015 news amuses
someone who inspires others and radiates
their own personal style the founder
refers to me as being fearless and
inspiring which makes me so incredibly
happy to do what I do what's really
exciting is Pacific is looking for their
newest 2016 news and is holding a news
content or you could win $10,000 and
it's being held from now until June 12th
if you think you could be the next Muse
check the description box for more
details on how to enter today I'll be
using Pacifica makeup which is an
all-natural beauty brand and I love them
here I'm filling in the sparse areas of
my brow so that they're nice and even
and now it's time for the eye shadow I'm
really excited about this because I'm
using a new palette this is the power of
love palette using this grayish shimmery
purple color and I'm applying it to my
lids and then I'm going to take these
dark nice darker purple you like my
accent I'm gonna take this darker purple
shadow it is a matte shadow I'm gonna
add it to the crease for some depth and
guys I did notice by the end of the day
the eyeshadow was still in the same
place no creasing it lasted all day
which is awesome because I didn't put
any primer on my eyes
I usually don't sometimes I'll put some
concealer but today I didn't even do
that and it lasted all day which is
amazing I just picked up this vanilla
color to highlight my brow bone with and
now the eyeshadow is complete very
simple very quick you can do this any
time of the day I want them to be very
wearable for you guys and easy to do and
now I'm just going to tightline
where my upper waterline is it just
makes your eyelashes look fuller now I'm
going to line the outer half of the
bottom waterline I'm using black for
this but you can use Brown for a daytime
look black is day and night for
so you can definitely switch out the
colors to whichever one you're more
comfortable with now I'm just going to
add a little bit of a black gel liner on
the top lash line just to make my lashes
look even more full and then I'm gonna
apply some mascara to add a natural
flush of color to my cheeks I'm sleeping
on a light pink blush and then for my
lippy I'm using the power of love
lipstick in the color rebel soul this is
my makeup for the day
if I'm out running errands sometimes
I'll go bare face but it's always nice
to take out some time to boost up your
natural beauty and as for the hair I
usually throw it up in a high ponytail
but lately I've been loving my natural
hair and I've been taking advantage of
my frizziness towards the top it adds
just a natural volume and then I'll just
curl random pieces towards the center
and leave the end out so that looks more
natural and effortless
as far as the rest of my day goes I'll
either go grocery shopping to the park
with Jada and go home do homework or do
homework at the park change it up a bit
and wait for my hubby to get home he's
an awesome part of my day that doesn't
get to get shown once the day nears the
end I'll make some me time I usually
like to read drink some tea edit my
videos it's important to have some time
for yourself
and if it's not putting on makeup maybe
it's reading a book whatever makes you
happy you should definitely take the
time out to do that I love you guys so
much and I'll see you in the next video
