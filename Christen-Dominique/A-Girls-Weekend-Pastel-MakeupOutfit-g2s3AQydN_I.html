and it feels like a dream
starting off apply primer to your entire
leg but you hold on
two-face loves to foil 15th birthday
palette while I was along there and I
mean it takes Oh towel and place it on
the lid and blend it up into the case
and now with my clean fluffy brush on
the coming away market and applying it
to the outer corners and into the crease
just a side note you can take the crease
color all the way in I'm not doing it
just because my eyes are kind of close
together already and if I stop half of
the way it helps them not look so close
together but if you don't have eyes like
mine or you just want to bring it in all
the way go ahead and do so alright so
now we're back with our semi clean
blending brush and softening the outer
edges giving the shadow more of a hazy
look for the highlight I'll be using
piano keys onto the brow bone and I'm
gonna press the color on and blend it
down into the other color so it looks
nice and smooth
okay so let's take David and Marge this
pretty iridescent blue color and smoke
it around the inner tear-duct and all
over the lower lashline I know this is
kind of different for you guys
I don't normally just put color and
light inner tear duct area but I'm gonna
try it for this look it's playful it's
the weekend let's do it
cuz the answer is yes I
now here I'm just blending the colors
together so that we
all right I knew this the daytime will
look but I want to add a little more
intensity to her look I'm gonna add more
of the darker color to the outer corners
and then just blend it all away so it's
nice and soft with James so to keep the
daytime pain going I'm going to use a
dark brown liner I'm gonna resist the
buckling I'm gonna put this on the upper
lash line but you know I have to lean it
out just a bit so just a tiny bit and we
need it out and smaller leaves our daily
date has appropriate not to mention that
they lift your eyes so it's like a
non-surgical
July in my lower lashline I'm going to
take this Laura Mercier special brown
liner it's a softer liner so it's gentle
on the waterline now I'm taking my
current favorite mascara it's from
Maybelline it's the rocket and I love
the mascara because of the brush has
these stiff little spokes on it so it
feels like it helps separate the lashes
better so there's not they're not so
clumpy and I know some of you already
know I've had really bad experiences
with clumpy masters and have but I think
this one works anyone else agree I
picked up these lashes from forever 21
over the weekend and they were only four
dollars I thought it was a great deal
and the packaging is super cute but
anyways I'm taking in the middle lashes
and I'm applying them to my lids and of
course you can see the glue but it dry
don't worry and then I'm just meshing my
real lashes and my buff lashes together
with a eyelash look like this which I
think they look pretty good now I'm
gonna highlight my face with my new
benefit highlighter in hiding has anyone
tried a moonbeam I really want to try it
but I can't find it at my Sephora maybe
it's at another one I don't know maybe
it's out of stock or something but I
really want to try it moving on to the
blush I'll be using who's your poppy
this one should gives you a luminous
finish and it's made with Daniel Hale I
think that's how you say it
it's an ingredient that helps with
hydration and elastin production so
that's pretty good and a little goes a
long way with this product for the lips
I'll be using my this lip gloss in
cupcake and literally it smells like a
cupcake I want to eat it so bad but I
resisted I did it anyways guys I hope
you enjoyed this look I really loved and
enjoyed making it for you and until the
next video bye dolly
it's rice you must be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
