I do when I get out of bed is go and
wake up Jaden and so here I am waking
him up and then what do you know it's
time to get up and you're already up
well I thought it was a good thing thank
you oh it was a good thing really to go
brush your teeth yeah okay come on so
here me and Jaden are brushing our teeth
and I do make sure now to conserve water
and I do not turn on the faucet while
I'm brushing my teeth and then I start
to wash my face and lately I've been
using the Polish toys clear I use the
cleanser first and then I take the
exfoliating solution on a cotton swab
and get all the dirt off of my face and
then I'll moisturize my face with their
skin clearing treatment moisturizer and
it's been working pretty good and then
I'll go and make Jayden breakfast so I'm
just pouring instance cereal and then
who watches Disney jr. well I get ready
my grandma isn't staying with us so I've
been getting kind of spoiled she's one
amazing lady and definitely a character
you'll see why at the end so now I'm
just walking over to my computer desk
and checking my email
sure I'm caught up with everything and
I'm drinking my tea because I have a
really sore throat right now and then I
like to go to my youtube channel and
make sure I'm caught up on all of
everybody's videos that I'm subscribed
to and now timing jam my favorite song
Saturday morning jumped out of bed but
I'm up this soon got in my car so I
would either use my vanity or like today
I'm actually using my mirror so I just
pull out all of my necessities for the
morning if I'm doing a video then I will
put on as much makeup but if I am NOT
doing a video and I'm just editing that
day then I will put on a full face but
today I'm actually filming and this is
the bag I used to fill up with all my
makeup that I'm filming with that day
sometimes I'll go barefaced or others
I'll just do foundation this is the main
stuff I'm using today because I'm
filming a video today so I'm just going
to get my face ready for it and so I'm
gonna put some primary foundation these
are concealers and highlighting pencil
for the problem it's my brow brush that
I use I just got this I just started
using that honest Aussie had products
and then I got this
this brow powder from whitening
lightening and sorry for my morning
voices sound kind of manly right now so
I do that first and then I put on this
pomade because I have no brows on the
ends at all so it sucks for me but yeah
that's what I used in I'm going to start
to put that on this face
so first I'll start off with my Murad
skin perfecting primer and I'll just
about all over my face with my fingers
and then I'll provide a foundation of
some kind today and using the Kahlan
Foundation and I'm not playing that with
my fingers as well because it's easy and
quick and then using my concealer for
monsters yet fires I've been using that
all through the month lately so I'm sure
you guys assume this a lot in my videos
but I love the weight coverage on it it
works great so I'm just covering my dark
areas like the sides recorders my mouth
and my under eye circles now I'm using
my brow powder to kind of fill in sparse
areas and doing that like so and rushing
them it through and then I'm going back
with a pomade and just applying that to
the areas where there is hardly any hair
at all and then I'll brush through that
as I go so it looks more actual and
that's pretty much the brows and then
from this contour kit I've been loving
the yellow powder I'll just mix them
together and then kind of set my
concealer and brighten up your eyes and
then curl my lashes after that my face
is pretty much done and then I'll go in
and curl my hair today so you're going
to be seeing a summer makeup look coming
up soon with this hair
and when I film I like to be super
comfortable so this is what I'm wearing
today and then I have my my computer bag
that's where I the computer used to edit
my videos in studio and then this is my
lunch that was solid right there that my
grandma made she me breakfast in lunch
well she's been here like every day
she's only gonna be here for the summer
it's been really nice and then I have
like my makeup that I'm using here in
that cold bag and today a ham of
Logging's I'm taking this bag here for
my camera so it can be extra careful
with my camera so before I leave and I'm
making my grandmother her favorite
coffee which is this chocolate glazed
donut coffee this is actually both of
our favorite coffees and I'm using the
Universal Studios coffee mug I got her
think it's super cute here hey gang if
anything I can't my grandma I love you

so she's editing probably and that's my
desk but I'm filming today so I'm
probably yeah Christina's desk is
because you know where my desk oh this
is a mine right in this little corner
with this pillow and then I always
charge my computer there while I'm
editing here and I just basically sit
like this so this is basically where I
edit and I feel like literally this is
my office
thing because I try to be as comfortable
as I can when I'm editing like I want to
make it feel like in my head basically a
comfortable pillow because I am I put my
computer on top of it so that is infer
