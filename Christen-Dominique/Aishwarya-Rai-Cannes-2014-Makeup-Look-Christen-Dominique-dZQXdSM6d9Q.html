hi olli learn it today and doing the
Aishwarya Rai Cannes 2014 makeup look
I've had a ton of requests from you guys
for a really long time to do a makeup
look of her some of you guys think I
look like her I wish I look like her her
eye look is super simple very elegant
and fresh it's really all about the
liner and the lips and so this is the
look I hope you guys enjoy the video for
the primer I'm starting off with the
pure minerals correcting primer it
leaves your skin feeling super velvety
and it allows your makeup to glide on
smooth and even for foundation today I'm
using the cover effects natural finish
oil-free foundation in the color
g---forty it's even out my skin tone
and once everything is nice and even
I'll go in with my honest dodgy
concealer in 1.5 to brighten up my under
eyes and I like to drag it out to the
tops of my cheekbones so that it acts as
a highlight as well
and here's a random coffee break moment
my friend Krispy brought in blended
coffee from the coffee bean and it
tastes like a milkshake mixed with
marshmallows I don't know it's really
good but it's supposed to be healthier
because it's with almond milk and
something else but it's amazing and I
just had to throw that in there to make
sure my foundation stays put I'm gonna
take the cover FX powder in g---forty
and lightly Pat that on with a large
fluffy brush and the brush is from
bareMinerals it's the full flawless face
bruh face brush face brush so next I'm
using my favorite powder I feel like you
guys I know this is my favorite powder
already saves it so much but I'm just
going to brighten up my under eyes and
fill in those dark areas
I feel like this powder just fills in
every line in por without having to keep
applying it and I don't know I'm just in
love with this powder right now it's
currently my favorite powder so I
already filled in my brows but if you're
wondering what I used is the honest as
you have Beauty Express for brows and
eyes and brunette so I just took this
powder and filled in my brows and then I
took my dip brow in Ebony to kind of
draw in the tail in because I have no
brow towards the end if you guys want me
to do a tutorial on how I do my brows I
can do an updated browser teen just let
me know in the comments or for the
contour i'm using the honest dasya
contour kit i'm just going to lightly
contour my cheeks i'm using the mac 188
stippling brush and i like this because
it kind of makes it look like it's
airbrushed it's just very light contour
and I'm going to work it into the
temples
so I'm going to take the contour palette
here from honest as yet and I'm just
going to take one of the contour colors
I'm just going to wash this on to the
crease
aishwarya had a pretty champagne looking
shimmer on her lid so i'm picking up the
color sin from the urban decay ammo
palette and patting that onto the lid
but it wasn't as pigmented as i wanted
so i grabbed another color I grabbed the
Vincent Longo diamond shadow in the
color jewel 69 and this actually was the
perfect color it's super shimmery and
it's the perfect champagne color that
Aishwarya had it was pretty close now
I'm taking a gray shadow to add a touch
of added dimension to the outer crease
she didn't have anything dramatic for
shadows so I'm trying to keep it as
light as possible with this color next
I'm taking my Kat Von D tattoo liner to
add a tiny flick to the top lashline now
I'm going to take the liner and extend
it past the tear duct to form a point
and then lining the inner corner to
exaggerate the length of my eyes and I'm
not going to lie about this liner it
dried up the third time after I used it
which is sad because I really wanted to
like it because the tip is so fine but
oh well it happens now I'm going to take
my Urban Decay all nighter pencil and
I'm just going to line the inner and
outer part of the lower lash line and
also tight line
so I'm about to apply some mascara
before I do that I'm going to curl my
lashes and for mascara today I'm trying
out the Urban Decay's new mascaras this
is the subversion lash primer and then
I'm going to take the perversion mascara
and apply generous coats to the top and
bottom lashes
maximum apply false lashes she has
really natural wispy looking lashes
these are self-adhesive
and they already come with the glue on
them so I'm going to try it up these are
a little different but I kind of like it
the glue feels really secure I don't
feel like it's going to fall off
further lips I'm going to use the bare
minerals mocks marvelous Moxie lipstick
in the colour live it up it's just a
really nice Coralie red color no this is
really pretty
I'm going to take this blush from
forever21 it is rose petal I feel like
it's a bit too pink for the look so I'm
going to take some of my contour color
here mix it so I'm keeping it right
behind the apples of the cheeks so that
you get a natural look
alright guys I hope you enjoyed the look
