asleep
hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today we are doing this face right here
when you see this face you know it's a
vs. I am doing American verse Arabic
makeup and I fell in love with the
Arabic makeup I think it's so gorgeous
Arabic for one is a language it's not
something that is a style it's not a
style but we when we google it what
comes up but I am ahead and did this cut
crease colorful dramatic elongated eye
it's just so beautiful I love it so much
I just I feel like huda beauty for a
second or maybe that's just my
imagination wishful thinking anyways I
like this side a little bit better than
this one I like I still like the
American side but this one is just so
it's just mmm
anyways you let me know which side you
like better American or Arabic makeup
let me know in the comments below before
we start this video because I want to
read your comments I mean actually when
I upload this video I'm gonna go be
going through your comments to see which
one you like better if you're ready to
get into this video don't forget to
subscribe to my channel and hit got a
notification bow so you can be a part of
the quad family and without further ado
let's get on with this video I'm gonna
start off with my brows first I feel
like in America we're starting to get
into more of the feathered brow look I'm
gonna do feathered on the American side
and I'm gonna do both brows on the other
side of my face I'm gonna start off with
shade number five and goof-proof from
benefit and I'm just going to outline my
brow and on the Arabic side make it a
little bit more dramatic so I'm gonna
use a heavier hand on the side Arabic
brows are really full thick and very
angular I'm gonna just try to make mine
look as full as possible and those lines
are really defined so I'm just gonna
come through them with the spoolie end
of the brush I'm just softly
upwards and then I'm gonna go in with
shade number six and precisely my brow
pencil and start to fill that in even
deeper now I'm just gonna lock it in
with some powder I have the foolproof
brow powder it's my favorite for all
powder right now from benefit and I'm in
the shade number five so I'm going to
take the darkest shade and set every
everything in place so we have our
Arabic brow right here we like bold
looks too here in America but I'm gonna
do more of a feathered brow rather than
the solid kind of look so I'm gonna go
in first with this guy again because
just to outline the bottom it's a little
bit quicker and with this brow I'm gonna
comb through it as I go because I don't
want it to be too bold this is the
precise of my brow pencil in number
three it's a little bit lighter and
start to feather in my brow hairs kind
of like an a gradient from a lightest to
darkest so I'm going to start here gonna
go in with the powder which is the same
powder that we used for this eye but I'm
gonna use the darkness shade for the
tail end and then the lightest shade for
the front of the brow just so you guys
know this is the 317 winged liner brush
from zoeva and it's very narrow so
that's why I like using it on the front
of my brows it's like micro bleeding
with makeup and you always want to leave
a little bit of space in between so that
it actually looks like here I'm also
gonna bring out the tail in so it's not
so pointy actually for both brows I'm
gonna take some concealer and clean up
the edge I'm gonna use my heart-shaped
Cape in light neutral and then take a
little bit on my hand it's just gonna
make it look extra sharp clean and
defined so I'm gonna work that all the
way onto the lid so I can use this as a
primer now we get to the brow you want
to be very careful and make sure that
line is straight before the American
side I'm gonna use the medium shape tape
not as bright prime the eye oh my leg is
falling asleep oh my gosh to set my eyes
I'm gonna be using the new a two-faced
chocolate gold palette and I'm also
going to be using the huda beauty a
desert dust palette at the same time
because this has more
colorful matte shades and this one has
more of these shimmery shades that are
colorful so I'm gonna be using both of
them together and the first color that
I'm picking up from the gold palette is
this one right here this is rolling in
dough so cute and work that all over the
lid just to set it in place but our
eyeshadow moves around really smoothly
on our eye and it doesn't like skip or
get touchy we want a smooth surface to
kind of move our brush freely so I'm
gonna start off with the transition
shade I'm gonna go in with chocolate
truffle and then take my dose of colors
blending brush and just start to it will
work this to the crease moment I keep it
pretty far out because we want to
elongate our eyes on this side I'm gonna
go into the crease focus it on the outer
portion of our eye and really elongate
the eye shape so I'm gonna take it way
past the outer V I'll take a little bit
more on the brush and then start to
working on the outer part of the eye
just intensifying that crease shade work
my brush very softly in this area barely
putting any pressure down on my eye and
then just start to bring it in like this
very lightly like a feather and then for
this crease right here I'm gonna take so
bougie and this is going to be our key
shape but we don't usually elongate that
far out we do like a nice intense crease
so I'm gonna go in these little back and
forth motions I'm gonna see basically
right cupping right around the lid just
go back and forth and then I'm gonna
take this all the way and then I'm gonna
use heavy pressure going right in here
because we're not being super artsy with
this eye you like the drama and you can
use back and forth motions or little
circular motions whatever works best for
you and you're blending out your shadow
sometimes I even like to come in at an
angle use very light pressure and I feel
like it really just blends your shadow
out so beautifully like that so that's
our first little crease shade and I
built it up a second time
a little bit and then I'm gonna go in
with cocoa truffle the one we used on
this I write down a little further down
on the ID you still want that so bougie
shade to peek through so we're going
right underneath that for this side I'm
gonna go ahead and take this really
pretty matte purple shade amethyst from
the huda beauty desert dusk Paulo and
this is the Alexi 229 tapered blending
brush so I'm going to take some of that
shade the purple and focus it right on
the crease and kind of the same thing we
just want it to disappear into nothing
right in here so I'm going to use a
super light feather touch hand and then
as we go further out we want to use a
little bit more pressure I don't want
this color to touch the lid so I'm going
to try to be careful with that and just
remember to take it all the way out
right to the end of the tail of the brow
to make it a little bit more easier on
yourself you can always put tape right
here and line it up to the end of the
brow Z 234 brush it's just a flat shader
brush so I'm gonna pick up more of the
amethyst color flip my brush upwards and
just line it up with the brow with a
bone right on the crease bone let's line
the color up right in there and then I'm
gonna flip the brush over and start to
work this color upwards and just softly
push out the edges so it looks soft and
then with the clean brush to remember
where it's at I think it's this one I'm
going to clean up right in here again
just go over it very lightly and then
for this side of the eye I'm just gonna
take a darker shade this is called booed
I'm gonna take this shade right here for
the American side and intensify the
crease with this of the American side
I'm gonna do this shade right here this
is called famous it's such a pretty
color and just work them
I'm actually going to bring in the brown
and bring it right into the edges right
here it gives the gold like a different
look and then I just want it to kind of
fade into one another and then on this
eye I'm going to take some concealer I
want to deepen this up with a little bit
of black and this is a exact blend a 32
brush from Sigma and I'm just gonna go
right underneath that purple and then
I'm gonna go ahead and take the
concealer and clean this up concealer is
like the magic eraser I'm gonna go in
with the gold this is chocolate gold
this one all right here and I'm gonna
work that on in the inner corner of the
eye I mean the inner third of the eye
I really like the Arabic style of makeup
because they're not afraid to use color
and they're also not afraid to do
different shapes with their eyes like
they'll do triple we double winged it
just really elaborate beautiful makeup
this pink shade oh my gosh I hope this
turns out good you guys live in lavish I
just really want to use this pink shade
this is actually how I used to do my
makeup in high school I would always
have pink on the outer part of my lid
and then gold on the inner part or I do
happen half and I wouldn't blend it
that's just my life this matte black
shade right here I'm gonna pop it on the
outer part of the lid and I'm gonna do
an intense cat eye so here we go
my eye look looks almost like a pinata
but we're gonna go with it I'm gonna go
ahead and make an intense wing what I
like about Arabic makeup is that it's a
full eye of liner bottom top tight line
waterline everything is black in
dramatic and that's what I love about it
so let's go I'm gonna do here I'm gonna
bring it out and extend it a little bit
further out here gonna use the other
side which is this pencil it's super
super super dark black so I'm gonna go
right underneath I'm gonna go all the
way in and touch the end of this
and then with the other side I'm gonna
connect these two guys he can have a
little point like a little tiny one and
I kind of went outside of the line right
here but it's gonna kind of work for us
because we're gonna smoke this bottom
parsh partion I'm gonna smoke this
bottom portion out to go on the other
eye and I'm gonna do a wing it's gonna
be a little bit different than this
dramatic cat eye wing so for this I I'm
just gonna go I'm gonna follow where it
ends right about there and then start to
bring it in you like to be dramatic too
over on this side but we don't elongate
our eyes as much we're still long gating
the eye we're lifting it but we're just
doing a shorter version of this eye
right here and then for the liner I'm
actually going to take the liner just to
show you guys I'm gonna go in on the
waterline still take it in make it
dramatic but not all the way in just
about half way so we still have that lip
though now that we have that I'm gonna
go ahead and do the lashes for the
lashes we both like dramatic lashes but
the eyes are so elongated in so extra
dramatic the lashes are going to be ten
times that these are actually my
favorite lashes these are the fair
lashes from hooded beauty but I feel
like these are so wide and long that
they're just gonna go perfect with their
gonna match this I really perfect so I'm
gonna get some glue on there and pop it
on on this eye I'm going to use the
Lillie lashes in tease this shape is
style put the the rest of the face I'm
just gonna put on a foundation this is
the huda beauty I already have primer on
I feel like a foundation is a foundation
when it comes to both styles of makeup
there's nothing particularly both like
full coverage don't think this side
really goes for the super tan I think
it's more sculpted on what I've seen
anyways so I'm not gonna focus too much
on getting really bronzy over here I'm
gonna focus more of the bronze on this
side but I just want my skin to be nice
and even right now actually applies
pretty good and I don't really I'm not a
fan of using brushes for foundation
but this one is pretty good on this side
I'm going to use the tart shape tape in
light neutral something a little bit
brighter I'm gonna go for that I'm gonna
do the Instagram kind of application on
this side I'm just gonna hit right in
this dark spot right here and then on
the American side I'm going to take
these shape tape in medium something a
little bit more close to my skin tone
and I'm gonna bring it down the same way
the hoola bronzer to contour
I'm just gonna set my under eyes with
some Laura Mercier translucent powder so
I'm gonna let that bake on my face while
that's doing that I'm gonna do my lower
lashline and then I'm gonna take this
shade right here this is called amber
this one I mix a little bit and pop that
on the outer portion of the lower
lashline I'm actually gonna bring it all
the way in like that and then now I'm
just gonna smudge out the black liner so
that it goes a little bit lower than
what it is right now we're going to
contour the face or the contour my knees
my Natasha - no no contour sculpting
powder and I'm gonna first snatch my
nose a lot of you guys ask what brushes
this I think this is the morphe m57 -
brush and really contour them nose bring
those little lines as close if you
really want your nose to be pinched you
want to bring these lines in really
close for the american side if you like
to look super tan so I'm gonna take this
Too Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer on my
cheeks bronzed up the forehead it's
gonna give us all over sunkissed glow
I'm gonna take it right down here to
behind the earring want everything to
kind of blend into one another on this
side I'm going to skip the tan I'm gonna
go straight to the contour i'm gonna use
this brush right here from the makeup
shakti at 31 and i'm just going to hold
it upwards and intensify that contour so
it's gonna give us a really sculpted
face I'm gonna take this blush from
Oprah this is Bellini I'm gonna put this
on in the American side it's a little
softer I'm gonna do that with a
stippling brush I'm just gonna keep it
right behind the apples of the cheeks
and then for the other side and you go
with something a little
more dramatic I'm going to use this over
sheet of blush and punch everybody loves
the eye light so I'm gonna take it this
cover effects palette right here
it's a highlighting palette and it has a
ton of shades in it actually gonna mix a
little bit of gold just these four right
here and then for the American side I'm
going to take these two shades over here
and just pop that right on top we can go
dramatic on both feel like I can go with
any lip it's gonna go in with a nude lip
this is max boldly bare I'm gonna do
more of a contoured lip on this side and
then I'm gonna go over with this the
colour-pop ultra matte lip and little
pump really little pump Gucci game I'm
gonna take it all right through there
and then on this side on the American
side I'm going to take Nicky's nude from
Micmac and just go over like that
the only difference I'm going to use the
huda beauty lip stroke this is in ritzy
this side I'm just gonna take a gloss
and go straight over this is mac
