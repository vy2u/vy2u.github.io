really you like the bold side yeah
rather than this side Korean no it's not
it's totally different well it kind of
seems like a very soft well everybody
else doesn't like his dramatic makeup
we're just so extra hey guys welcome
back to my channel so today as you can
see as you can tell by the title of this
video and my face this is the American
versus French makeup tutorial I just
recently went to Paris for a Paris
Fashion Week and I was able to see the
style of makeup I also just did a ton of
research looking up how they do their
makeup and everybody pretty much has the
same idea natural glowing skin either a
bold lip and natural eye or a wing and a
natural lip basically the French like to
embrace what they already have but on
the american side as you can see we are
so extra we do a bold dramatic eyes bold
lips contoured sculpted face highlight
to the gods and this side is just very
natural glowing from within I was born
like this and I just woke up flawless to
give you guys a quick update as you know
I released a sneak peak on my Instagram
about my cosmetic line dominique
cosmetics it is coming very soon making
any type of makeup is a very long
process I've been working on it for a
year now and I'm still down to the bone
analyzing everything making sure
everything is perfect before you guys
get it you want more updates or sneak
peeks I will be releasing a sneak peek
very very soon on dominica Beauty which
is the Instagram for dominique cosmetics
so make sure to follow that instagram
i'll have it below in case you guys are
wondering what the updates are when the
latte palette is coming out even saying
that just makes my heart so happy so
that's a little update on my cosmetic
line back to these half-and-half makeup
if I go to another country which I
travel pretty often I will be doing this
right here so if you want to see how I
got this look don't forget to subscribe
to my channel and hit that notification
Belle's need to be a part of the quad
family and without further ado we're
gonna get on intermarry you like
longevity of makeup on her face I'm
gonna take this primer right here from
Smashbox and I'm gonna work that into my
skin like this because it is a little
bit of the thicker
formula that gets into those large pores
so it's gonna fill them in and make them
look like one even surface it's also
gonna help my makeup last longer for the
French side they usually like to use BB
creams or CC creams on their face
nothing too heavy what I've read and
what I've seen when I was in France a
lot of them just really embraced some
natural skin and if they have flaws it's
very minimal they're really into skin
care so the micellar water is really big
they're a really good moisturizer and
then just something that's going to give
your skin and even look and a nice
healthy looking glow is what they go for
so for coverage on the French side of my
face I'm gonna use something with
moisturizer something that's going to
give my skin a little bit more of an
even look and hide a little bit of
blemishes but not a full layer of
coverage so I'm going to use the origins
tinted moisturizer and this is a sheer
tint release so it comes out white but
as you work it into your skin it works
into the natural shade of your skintone
little dots around the face like this or
if you need a little bit more coverage
like I feel like I do I'll just put on a
little bit more of the BB cream it's all
about looking as natural as possible
still want your skin to peek through we
want it just to look hydrated healthy
and glowing not like American glow not
like the I went on blind the haters kind
of glow oh this is more like a natural
soft glowing from within kind of glow
this tinted moisturizer is perfect for
that you can still see blemishes but
they're not as intense and the skin
overall just looks even and just a
little bit more healthy so for the
American side we're gonna take it on
normally do this is my life I love the
cake so for that I'm going to take this
YSL foundation right here this is a
full-coverage foundation please ignore
my nail I know I'm gonna use our
imagination and pretend for a second and
you're gonna start to see that my skin
flaws are disappearing with this side
you can still see the skin peeking
through and we're kind of just embracing
our skin what it's going through and on
this side we're covering it up so
basically we're just extra American
girls are just I feel like I need to
frame my face before I go any further so
I'm gonna go into the brows for the
brows and using the brow is it from
anastacio and dark brown and I'm just
gonna comb through this foundation that
I got on my eyebrow and then on this
side I'm just literally brushing upwards
cuz that's very natural in these parts
so on the French side they usually like
to just fill in the sparse areas define
the natural brow shape a little bit
further but they don't touch the top at
all comb upwards so they look nice and
groomed follow that natural shape of the
brow the other thing is not to change
how your face naturally flows so if your
brow is going up and around you just
follow that natural flow of your brow so
I'm just going to do the bottom a little
bit it's more about enhancing the
natural shape and showing that you know
your brow is alive and naturally okay I
don't know this thing just broke so I
don't know how that happened or this
side of my face I would be adding and
filling in and shaping and carving out
so I'm gonna fill in the sparse areas
you create little brow hairs here I'm
actually gonna use this brush just
because this one this fully broken is
just a little bit easier to use this one
to fill in so I'm just gonna use the
benefit to goof proof brow pencil then
we're going to carve out the brow so I
have my tart sheet tape and I'm gonna
put a little bit on the back of my hand
first starting off with
I light the brow and carpet out and then
we're going to do the bottom so now
we're here we're just going to put some
on the lid so that everything is nice
and even we're gonna have a clear even
canvas for our eyeshadow then I'm just
gonna work my Beauty Blender right on
top of that and that is the brow for the
American side very dramatic very intense
and structured so for this side of the
eye right here I'm gonna start on
applying a little bit a little bit of
eyeshadow I did not see anybody with
eyeshadow at all if any eyeshadow is
used it's definitely a very soft crease
shade so I'm gonna take the morphe 3 502
palette I'm gonna take this shade right
here which is the lightest shade in the
palette and I'm just gonna work that
right through the crease for definition
I want to use the Charlotte Tilbury
palette I'm changing it up a bit
I honestly think those are too warm for
the French side so I'm taking smoke I'm
gonna add a little bit more into the
crease just add a little bit more depth
and right in here I'm actually gonna
bring the smoke and I'm gonna bring it
right on top the lash line just to add a
little bit more definition and then on
this side right here is very appropriate
to lose the morphe palette for this so
I'm gonna take these two shades work
them in my crease lovely warm shades
here in the US so I'm gonna take those
and just wash that right into my crease
grab a few more crease shades because
you like really defined creases so I'm
going to take this Brown right here now
I'm gonna grab a darker Brown something
really dark let's go with this shade
right here focus that on the outer part
of the crease down into the lid and then
right on the inner part of the lid I'm
going to take this brush wheeze or
to carve out our crit burn brow and
we're gonna just carve out right where
our crease would start so right in here
and these bring in a concealer down I
don't want to bring it all the way and
just right on the inner third and then
right on top I'm going to add this rose
gold it's gonna be a vibrant intense
shimmery lid now I'm gonna just deepen
up the crease with this black I'm gonna
add eyeliner to this side of the eye
because we like our wings so I'm gonna
do a dramatic wing to add to the drama
on this side of the eye it kind of feels
nice knowing that I don't have to line
up this wing to match this one so I feel
like I can just do whatever and go crazy
with it one thing I notice is that they
like to use an eyelash curler every
single time they do their lashes because
this is basically all that they do on
their eye unless it's a wing so I'm
gonna curl my lashes before I put on
mascara on this side and to really get
the maximum curl out of your lash I like
to pump the mascara and then start to
move it but I usually put on some
mascara right away just to prep for
lashes the lashes I'm putting on are
from Lily lashes and actually this is my
travel wash so I have a few in here and
I think these are Miami I'm not
mistaking Miami's are a popular lash to
wear in the u.s. but they're just such a
beautiful lash I would wear them no
matter where I'm from so while that
dries I'm gonna go to the French side of
my face and I'm gonna start to put on a
mascara this mascara is a really good
one saman 'yes this one from Maybelline
it's the colossal Big Shot the makeup
Shayla one and baddest black is my
all-time favorite one I use it all the
time
so I'm just gonna use that and we wiggle
up my brush from the base up into the
top okay I'm gonna let that dry and then
curl them again so that's pretty much it
for the eyelids now I'm gonna work on
the concealer because I want to get down
to the lower lash line heart-shaped tape
is a must it's very full coverage it is
thick and it covers everything
to the Instagram kind of makeup here
while we're here we're just gonna
highlight this little area right on
there and the chin the Cupid's bow I'm
gonna let that sit for a second and then
on the French side I'm going to use the
NARS radiant creamy concealer and I'm
just gonna do a little bit right in here
to brighten it up so this is the
difference between the two so I'm gonna
come over here on this side and start to
work that in you like our faces to look
highlighted in every aspect contoured
and just very dramatic I learned from
the French that they don't like to use
brushes really this doesn't go for
everybody but from what I've seen the
majority don't like to use brushes and
they'll use their hands or their
fingertips somebody's mine use this
fingers since it's nail free and this is
only for people who have dark under-eye
circles if you don't have dark under-eye
circles
concealing is not even necessary we're
gonna mix this shade right here with
this one and we're gonna put that right
on the lower lash line
and then I'm gonna add a black eyeliner
right on the waterline some mascara on
and my lower lashes and then for the
inner corner we like bright highlights
and this looks like a bright shade right
here I can add that to the inner corner
of my eye so I'm gonna go into with
smoke for the French side I'm just gonna
add a little bit of color right on the
lower lash line right on the outer part
of the lower lash line I'm just blending
the edges out add mascara to the lower
lashes my lashes are pretty dry so I'm
gonna go back over them with a lash
curler and then just clamp them down
this tie looks a lot more wide awake and
fresh this one is just ready to party or
the American side we are gonna contour
because contouring is contouring is
everything for that I've been using the
offensive Beauty contour stick in mocha
the cheekbone with like high cheekbones
temple this side of the nose everything
has to be sculpted defined we slimmed
down the nose right there and bam we're
done with our contouring on this side of
the face
they don't really contour but they do
bronze I'm gonna use this bronzer from
NARS and I'm gonna use this on my cheeks
just to add some color into the cheeks I
just look like two different people to
me right now what about you they go for
more of that golden bronze I've seen
almost every French makeup artist use a
cream blush I'm gonna use this cream
blush from Stila this is the shade
petunia I'm going to add a very tiny
amount of that to the cheeks nothing
heavy at all literally the smallest
amount because you don't like pink
cheeks as they don't want to look super
young and they want to look like mature
women
so a really young baby doll kind of look
is not something that they go for so I
just took a little bit of that just to
add like a natural glow and flush to the
cheeks for this side of the face we are
not done yet setting everything in place
with the powder version of what I just
did to contour and highlight some needs
the kat von d palette for that and I'm
just going to go really fast through
that and then personally I like to use
more of
warm-toned bronze so I'm using the
bronze goddess from estÃ©e lauder on
this side to bronze up the face it has a
little bit more of a warm tone to it and
then for blush I'm gonna use this powder
blush from Kylie who loved us and Kylie
because they like more of a natural dewy
looking highlight I'm gonna use peach
frost from Too Faced it's a it's called
a melting powder highlight so it's a
very natural-looking highlight so I'm
going to take this shade right here and
just work that on my cheeks it's gonna
be very soft and then on this side we
love our highlight we want to blind
people with our highlight these two
actually I'm gonna use the one from Mac
this is the oh darling extra dimension
skin finish on my cheek we want to blind
our haters and the tip of the nose right
above the brow Cupid's bow chin and then
I'm gonna take because we are so extra
here I'm gonna take the artist Couture
diamond glow powder and cocoa gang it's
something you want to wear when you're
just feeling yourself when you wear this
so the difference between the highlights
is very extreme and then for this side
of the face I'm going to use the Kylie
liquid lip because you love Kylie's lips
but first I'm going to line up the lips
this is the makeup forever number 14 lip
liners in case you guys are wondering
and then I'm gonna put on it is Kylie
velvet liquid lipstick in boysenberry
and that is the completed look for the
American side and for the last but
definitely not least French side of the
face
so French usually go for the natural lip
and the very small flick of the wing or
they go for the bold lip and the very
natural looking eye so since we went the
natural looking eye I'm gonna go for a
bold lip and for that I'm going to use
the L'Oreal infallible and this is in
the shade Matador I'm going to take this
and they love reds I noticed that a lot
of them like red that is a really pretty
and this red will not go anywhere
because trust me it is hard to take off
