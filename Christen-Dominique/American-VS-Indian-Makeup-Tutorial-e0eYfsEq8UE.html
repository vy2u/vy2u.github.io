ah hey guys welcome back to my channel
so today I'm gonna be comparing Indian
makeup versus American soft springtime
natural glam makeup so I love Indian
makeup I think it's so beautiful the
Indian weddings are so beautiful
actually my stepdad and my little sister
they are Indian little sisters half
Indian half what I am love the Indian
culture I think the food is amazing the
clothing that they wear is just
beautiful and elaborate so I really
wanted to showcase that red and gold
kind of classic Indian makeup so I hope
you guys love this video and before we
get into it don't forget to subscribe to
my channel and hit that notification bow
so you can be a part of the quad family
and without further ado let's get on to
the video so all over the entire face
I'm gonna put the first Ollie volcanic
elixir drops this is such a hydrating
stat before foundation I love using this
even over primer I feel like this work
is better than primer sometimes for the
brows I feel like both sides are pretty
much the same they're both just
following the natural shape of the brow
and then filling in the sparse areas I'm
just gonna basically do the same thing
it maybe just try to make my brows a
little bit more feathered on the
American side so I'm gonna take my LC
b12 brush and my benefit foolproof
powder in number 5 and I'm just gonna
start to fill in my brows just the way I
would naturally just filling in all the
bald spots
so that is the American and I'm just
going to brush comb the hairs up so that
they look more feathered to get that
just brushed wispy kind of brow hair
look I'm gonna go ahead and take the
benefit brow conditioning primer and I
actually really really like this for
studying the brows it has a tiny little
grooves so it grabs every single bit of
hair that you have and it pulls it
straight so for that feathered look I
really like using this and the brow gel
is strong enough to where it'll stay
where you put it so I'm just gonna brush
all of the little hairs upwards and on
the other eye I'm just gonna take the
same powder and then I'm gonna fill in
the brow hairs to where it's more of a
classic brow look I'm just gonna follow
the natural shape of my brow so on this
brow I'm gonna fill in more of the
spaces than what I did with this one
because it's what I wanted it to be kind
of wispy Indian makeup is super fierce
very glam smoked out I'm gonna start
with the eyes first so I'm gonna start
with this eye right here which is the
Indian eye so I'm gonna focus more of
the glam here and so that there's a
difference I'm gonna do a soft glam on
this side now the first thing I want to
do is put on concealer to the lid
because I really want those shadows to
stick I don't want them to budge so I'm
gonna take because I want my eyeshadow
to really stand out and I want it to
last I'm gonna go ahead and take the
revolution conceal and define this is
the shade c7 and I by the way guys this
is only seven dollars and this concealer
is so bomb if you're looking for a dupe
for the heart-shaped Cape this is it and
it's only seven dollars so just giving
you guys a little tip there I'm gonna go
ahead and pop that on my eyelid just a
little bit and then I'm gonna take a
flat brush and start to work that into
the rest of my lid and we're gonna cover
the entire lid space with this this is
gonna act like our primer since we're
here we have all this concealer on our
lips so we're gonna go ahead and sharpen
up and really define and carve out that
brow shape for this I am just gonna use
foundation it's just a little bit of a
lighter feel on the lid
and I'm not trying to do like full crazy
glam so both the eyes are primed and
ready to go so I'm gonna start with the
Indian side and I'm gonna take the dose
of colors cream at eye color and I'm
gonna use that to kind of map out my
wing and kind of actually set it as a
base
oh hello I almost forgot this part I'm
gonna take a piece of tape and pop it
right where I want that wing so I'm
gonna take my wing liner brush this is
from zoeva it's the 317 liner and this
cream I'm going to just do my base wing
so okay my camera cut off so you can see
I put a little bit of eye shadow right
here what I did is I took the Too Faced
chocolate gold palette and I picked up
this shade right here it's called so
bougie and I'm just picking it up with
this Sigma e 70 brush and I'm working it
just above like right above the crease
actually just a little bit further up
this is gonna help your gradient look
really smooth so I try to keep this away
from all the other shades fashion is
usually something I contour my nose with
but it works perfectly for the crease
too with another like fuller fluffier
brush I'm gonna take the same shade and
just bring it down a little bit further
now I'm gonna take cocoa truffle which
is this guy right here
use these circular motions to work it in
and make sure we don't touch so bougie
that first shade we used now I'm gonna
add the black with the same brush and
the black that I'm using is right here
in this palette it's called decadent so
this guy right there and same thing with
the brown we're just gonna inch our way
in so just use these little circular
motions it's the best way to blend out
black when you're mixing black and brown
is just using a feathery light touch
just like this in the circular motions
super soft it's gonna be really hard to
get yourself out of the black mess so
it's just have patience and use a soft
hand and you'll be good you'll get
through this and you'll have a beautiful
gradient eye you're gonna have like the
best most beautiful a smoky eye
anybody's ever seen so have patience it
helps a lot and if you feel like your
brushes have way too much product just
take a clean brush and go over the edges
like that so that you don't have any
extra color getting in there moving it
around so I'm going to take this gold
right here chocolate gold use that my
inner lid actually helped since I have
it on my finger I'll just kind of work
it on like that
I'm actually gonna mix in a gold dipped
which is this one at the bottom and
we're going to make a wing so I'm going
to start from the inner corner because
Indian eyes are naturally kind of more
elongated and just sultry just naturally
they have that beautiful almond shape
but I also see a lot of the eyeliner
being hold out right into this inner
corner so how beautiful is this first of
all I'm gonna take some of that gold and
pop it on right on top
I do not realize how intense this tape
was see when I take the tape off how
sharp it is that wing is very dangerous
so I'm going to take the thicker wing
liner brush and just start to inch that
in so with a black liner I'm gonna take
that on the inner waterline and that is
it for the eye shadow on the eye so I'm
going to start on the American eye
shadow and that is gonna be so much
quicker and softer than this eye so for
this I am eni's the Anastasi a soft glam
I'm going to take burnt orange which is
right down here and dusty rose I'm just
gonna mix those two together like you
can work it on the bottom of the lash
line up into the crease and then the
lend out of the edges of the bigger
brush and for the inner corner here I'm
just going to use a glistening which is
this color right here
I'm gonna take ten perches this Matt
bone color and we'll work that on the
brow bone I'm gonna take those two
shades dusty rose and burnt orange and
I'm gonna work them on the lower lash
line too just not going in all the way
but just to write about halfway and you
know what I'm actually gonna add one
more color to this look rustic right
here was just calling my name for this
look so we're gonna use him and also
kiss this shade on the outer crease just
adds a little bit more depth right there
I'm just gonna take the darkest Brown in
this palette which is Cypress umber this
right here just work it on the upper
lash line like on the outer part of that
for lash line
I don't want to take it all the way in
I'm just gonna bring it right about
there and voila
now I'm gonna add some mascara for the
Indian side I'm going to use the Lily
lashes in the style Miami while that
lash dries down I'm gonna pick up these
other Lily lashes and the style diamonds
for the American side for the Indian
side they look very high coverage so I'm
gonna go ahead and take these UA
essential high coverage cream foundation
I actually this is one of my favorite
favorite foundations because it's full
coverage and I love full coverage tube
or the lighter side I'm gonna go with
the Giorgio Armani luminous silk
so for concealer on the Indian side I'm
going to take the makeup view revolution
concealer and really go in so basically
what I do on a normal basis and then for
the American side since we're doing
something a little bit lighter I'm going
to take the Kim the k'kaw concealer in
the shade 5 and I'm just gonna work that
on my darkest area which is right here I
take it too far out but I'm also going
to take it up
now I'm just gonna bake underneath my
eyes and I just I'm gonna use the same
powder for both this is the shade too
from k'kaw I have been using it all the
time I really really like it don't put
it on right underneath the eyes so that
my concealer doesn't crease I feel like
contouring is pretty much the same for
both sides the only difference is
because I'm doing a softer American look
I'm just gonna bring it
like I'm gonna cup the cheek right here
just to make it a little bit more so
taking a lighter contour color I'm just
bringing it around right there and then
on the other side by the way I'm using
the Kat Von D shade and light palette
I'm gonna use the darker shades which
are towards the end so I'm using this
medium one and a little bit of the
deeper shade to really give me thats
pulp did look but with this one because
I want it to be more structured I want
it to go further out like straight out
like this instead of a cut
okay so I'm gonna wipe away the extra
powder now something a little bit extra
that I've been doing is using the k'kaw
which I really like her concealers her
powders everything from there is so
amazing and it actually does not look
cakey when you do this I was a little
scared that it would but it really
doesn't so I'm going to take that and to
add even more brightness to the under
eyes and are like right along the nose
after you contour it just kind of helps
everything flow together so on the
American side I'm going to take this
thrive Cosmetics bronzer right here in a
Sunchaser I'm gonna put a little bit on
this side too just to blend out bronzer
out I mean to blend the contour a little
bit for blush on the Indian side I'm
gonna take this one right in the middle
okay there is a lot of blush on there
and then for the highlight on the
American side I'm going to take this Mac
oh darling extra dimension skin finish
and for the Indian side I'm gonna take
this huda beauty 3d highlighter palette
and I'm gonna take some of Barbados
which is more of a cream just tap that
on the cheekbone like that and then I'm
gonna take Maldives okay so the last
thing we have left is the lip and I feel
like red is so classic and beautiful for
Indian weddings and just Indian makeup
in general I'd stand out to me for
Indian makeup so I'm gonna take this Mac
retro matte liquid lip color
for the American side I'm going to take
the k'kaw yellow gold lip gloss
