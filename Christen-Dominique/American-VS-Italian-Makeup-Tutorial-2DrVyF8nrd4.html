colored it I feel very summery right now
but this video is not about my hair
color it's about my face being like this
it is half and half it looks kind of odd
we are doing a half American versus
Italian makeup you guys gotta let me
know how I did I am in love with this
side of my face today like this is
something I can get attached to every
day the only thing I would change is
adding something on the bottom lashes
like I have to have I feel naked
underneath here I'm just saying this
side is super extra I love being extra
loving glam so this is a very American
style instagram-worthy type of makeup so
I'm gonna use comparing Italian makeup
versus American makeup I haven't done
one of these in a little bit and I know
you guys love them so I asked you guys
on Twitter which one I should do most of
everybody said Italian so I did my
research I went online I googled Italian
makeup I looked up Italian makeup artist
Italian products Italian women are
beautiful naturally it's all about the
natural beauty it's all about the baby
skin the natural subtle radiant kind of
look the Sophia Loren kind of winged
nude lips I love this I feel like you
guys are gonna love it too you natural
or extra AF that's all you have to call
Matt I just want to know before we get
into the video don't forget to subscribe
to my channel and hit that notification
bell so you can be a part of the quad
family and without further ado we're
gonna get in to this video alright so
I'm gonna start off with primer first
the primer I'm using is this one right
here from Laura Mercier so I'm gonna go
in with this as a base Italian women
love to have radiant soft looking skin
they are all about skincare and just
naturally beautiful kind of looks for
Italian side we're gonna start with this
Mac next to nothing face color and I'm
using this because it has very light
coverage you're gonna be able to see
skin but it's gonna look even and very
natural I'm just gonna use a little bit
of the NARS natural radiant because I
need a tiny bit more coverage I like
this foundation because it does give you
that natural skin
finish so I'm gonna go on to the
American side and we're about to cover
our entire face we're gonna look like a
different person so for that I have
these you wave hi coverage foundation
and the shade almond and we are going to
make all these imperfections disappear
completely you won't really see natural
skin peeking through as much on the
American side not to say that we don't
like that look because sometimes like my
everyday look will look more like this
but if it's a real American full look
it's going to be like this side I notice
is that Italians like more of a full
coverage concealer and I feel like
that's because the base is very very
light and if you have any under-eye
circles or blemishes you can cover it up
a spot concealing I noticed that they do
not do the crazy triangle that we do and
then for the American side I'm gonna use
the NARS radiant creamy concealer in
custard and I'm using this one because I
did use a super full coverage foundation
so I'll use something that's a little
bit lighter some people just draw one
big triangle under their eye and then
some people will bring it out like this
which is basically the same effect we go
pretty far out like we'll go way out to
the cheekbone we kind of like to use our
concealer as highlight as well
especially since we're brightening these
areas you'll see this a lot on Instagram
and I'm going to go right here so I'm
gonna go back to the Italian side and
work this side in blending it in
now that our face is set in place I'm
gonna go into the brow so Italian brows
are very natural they are blessed with
just beautiful filled in and thick brows
which is something that I laughs we're
gonna fake it until we make it I'm gonna
go in super light with precise in my
brow pencil and shade three from benefit
and I'm just gonna sketch in really
really softly so that's pretty much it
on this side I just filled in all the
sparse areas on my brow and now I'm
gonna go in to the American side which
is a little more dramatic usually we
like this arched fuller brow and I'm
just gonna work that in I'm gonna go
ahead and draw in some brow hairs here
natural brow hairs now I'm going to take
my powder just to make sure that the
move then I'm gonna go ahead and use a
concealer just to make sure that
everything is super clean and sure then
now we're going into the eyeshadow for
the Italian side I really don't see much
eye shadow happening on this side so I'm
gonna take this Charlotte Tilbury face
an eye palette use the shade four which
is face bronze it's a very neutral color
and we're just going to go back and
forth right in here just to give the eye
some natural looking depth and then for
the lid we're gonna use this shade right
here very light very soft shimmery it's
very natural for the eyeshadow on the
American side it is gonna be a lot more
detailed so for that I'm gonna use the
huda beauty rose gold remastered palette
I'm gonna go in with a transition color
I'm going to take this guy over here and
this one down here I'm gonna mix them
together in my crease and just go back
and forth right in that crease I feel
like we like bold well blended I shout
in America and I'm also gonna take it
down to the lower lash line
we always usually have an eye shadow on
the lower lash line whereas in Italy the
lower lash line is very bare and then
I'm gonna go in with this pink color
right here this is Dollface we're all
about that oranjee crease also I'm
putting him right underneath now I'm
gonna go in with a darker shade of pink
which is this guy over here add some
more definition to the crease and then
with the darkest brown shade like that
go into the crease but I'm also gonna
really bring it into this outer corner
because I'm gonna add some drama there
I'm gonna bring the drama down on my
lower lash line too we're gonna take
black truffle which is just this Matlock
right here and use the same brush and
tap that on the outer V and this is
really gonna amp up the load I take rose
gold
pop it on to the lid and then for the
inner corner pink diamond eye light is
huge in America to like disco ball
highlight I am taking it really heavy on
the inner corner we're gonna go over to
the Italian side and do something that
they love love love so it's either a
bold lip plain-looking eyelid or it's a
wing with a nude lip first I'm gonna
line up the entire eyelid
very lightly we're gonna flick it out
really elongate the eye and lift the eye
and notice that they like that soft
focus wink so I'm going to kind of smoke
out the edges of the wing so it's not
super Cris take this tiny pencil brush
and just get a little bit of this number
three right here and go over the top so
it's very soft focus it's nothing too
perfect
and then for the extra side I'm gonna
take this eyeliner pen from Too Faced I
line up my wing for the lashes I don't
see many women in Italy wearing fake
lashes it all is just very natural for
me I'm gonna fake it and I'm gonna put
on some natural lashes so for the
mascara I'm using this Charlotte Tilbury
which is super super cute for lashes I'm
going to use Lily lashes these are
goddess now I'm gonna move on to the
American side of lashes I have my Lily
lashes in Lila which are these guys
right here and then just pop them right
on their fuller they're chunkier they're
thicker the contouring on the American
side is a must
I'm just going to take my efendi beauty
skin stick in mocha I'm going to define
the features on my face will make these
little lines here hide our double chins
Italians do not contour it's not a thing
so I'm going to take the NARS orgasm
illuminator and just work it right here
just gonna give us a soft dewy bronzy
kind of look and then I take a bronzer
there's no specific placement with the
bronzer it's just used for adding some
color to the face wash it onto the cheek
the forehead on this side you usually
just bake under our eyes like this and
right under here have this little duo
it's called breakfast at tiffany's it's
a cream shadow for eyes blush and lips
and take this right here it's like a
peachy pink and I'm just gonna pop it
right on this Sun this is gonna give us
such a soft youthful look and wipe off
the bake right here and on the jaw line
and then on this side I'm gonna really
amp up the glow
take this persona cosmetics highlight
right here in
but really amp up the glow on this side
on the tip of the nose artists cateura
Illuminati work it on my cheeks we're
gonna pile on the products on this side
of the face so we're not done yet for a
bronzer I have the urban decay beach -
bronzer in bronzed right here bronzed up
the cheeks so we have that contour so we
have structure now we want to add warmth
we always like to set our face so it
looks like skin again on two of the lips
though we can tone it down with it's not
like a super harsh line and take this
breakfast at tiffany's little set right
here from Charlotte Tilbury and I'm
gonna just pop on this color on the lid
that's it for this side so for this side
of the face I'm gonna use lip liner so
I'm gonna take the makeup forever lip
liner in number 21 now I'm gonna take
this huda beauty lip strobe in shameless
I want to add a little bit more to the
American side so I'm gonna take this
black liner and pop it in the waterline

dramatic we are ready to party
