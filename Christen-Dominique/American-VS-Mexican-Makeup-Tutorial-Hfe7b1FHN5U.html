some brow surgery right now he got got a
little lipstick on my teeth oh I got a
lot of lipstick okay red is everywhere
hey guys welcome back to my channel
since today I am doing another super
exciting video these are my favorites in
Paris and videos so I'm doing American
versus Mexican makeup I'm very excited
cuz I actually am half Mexican and so
I'm super excited for this video
I think Mexican makeup is just so
beautiful it's very flirty sexy
seductive but fresh and pretty at the
same time and I am obsessed I want to do
a full every time I do a look and it's
half and it looks so bomb I want to do
the whole face and I'm so tempting but
like nope we're gonna stick to our
routine I just went to Cancun I have a
little flower right here and a little
hoop earring to represent my culture
ever since I went to Korea I came back
and was inspired to do their half and a
half makeup versus our makeup and see
what's beautiful for them versus I just
done so well on my channel I think it's
the most exciting video for me to do and
you guys really love it so I'm gonna
keep doing it so if you have any
suggestions for me to visit or if you
have any suggestions for just for me to
look up and learn about a different
culture or country put your suggestions
below I hope you guys enjoy it and enjoy
the comparison don't forget to subscribe
to my channel and hit that notification
bells they give you a part of a quad
family I went out further adieu let's
get on into this video okay so I'm gonna
get started with the eyes first I'm
gonna take some of the Tarte shape tape
in the light medium and just pop it on
to the lid prime the lids it's gonna be
both ways for American and Mexican
because we both like to have really nice
clean eye shadow looks so I'm just gonna
do the top burn now and then I'll go
ahead and you conceal the rest of my
under-eye and then I'll do foundation
later this will be the Mexican side so
for that I'm gonna take the I left side
collab with color pop this is the Shiki
palette
we wanted to use atiba in this video but
I can't find it at all and it's like the
perfect red perfect name for this look I
was just so upset and go ahead and take
this shade which is distressed and I'm
gonna pop that all over the lid and then
for the American side of my face I'm
gonna be using the viola box top notch
palette they're all very cool tone
colors
I usually go in with warm shades but I'm
going to pick up some cool tone shades
that I haven't used and I haven't even
use this palette at all so we're
breaking it in today so I'm gonna go
into the crease with freckles it's a
matte Brown and I'm gonna take I'm gonna
pick up this shade right here as my
first transition shade for the mexican
side so I'm just gonna go in right here
with a very light hand and more so
towards the outer part of the crease
bring it out I haven't even done my
brows yet so I'm gonna go in with top
notch top notch is more of a peachy warm
shade so I'm gonna go all over the eye
with this bring it to life like that and
I think more so on this side actually
the lighter shade of that pale bone
color is a little bit more geared
towards the Mexican makeup because I
feel like the American side we go for a
warmer tone so I am toning it down and
kind of blending it into the rest of my
skin I'm gonna go in with exclusive and
I'm gonna use that right in the crease
I'm gonna take it all the way in you
mean that we're using coal tone shades
today we still like the drama in America
so I'm gonna take it all the way into
the inner corner and really darken up
that crease we don't focus too much on a
specific area of the eye I feel like
having this outer corner really defined
for the mexican side it makes it more
flirty and just a little bit more sultry
so I think that is fitting for this side
of the eye on the American side I'm just
gonna bring that crease shade all the
way in to the outer inner corner okay so
that's basically it for the initial
crease shades I'm gonna go back over to
the Mexican side and we're actually
almost done on this side it's pretty
easy and very basic we are gonna go in
with the darkest Brown that I
in the palette which is no chance and
Matt's brown which is right here I'm
gonna pick it up first with this Musante
brush I like how it's tapered so it kind
of fits perfectly into that crease and
I'm just gonna keep it right in here I'm
gonna first use this brush this fluffier
brush it still stays specific to the
crease area without getting all over the
lid and past the brow bone gives us a
nice wash of this color really buff out
those edges you don't want any harsh
lines so now that we have the intensity
of that color I'm gonna go in with a
smaller pencil brush so I can get a
deeper outer crease that's gonna add a
really nice sultry flirty kind of look
just amp up the outer V a tad bit more
buff out the edges and the lid is
basically using the same color we set
with but really just amplifying that
pale bone color it just makes the eye
look really youthful and well rested so
I'm gonna take a more densely packed
brush and I'm gonna pack on that pale
bone shade all over the lid right on the
brow bone I'm gonna take a fluffy brush
just a big huge fluffy brush and buff
all of the edges out make sure
everything just kind of flows together
and just moves into one another really
easy and then for the American side I'm
gonna go ahead and take a darker Brown
this is extra I'm gonna pop that on with
the smaller crease brush is the 206 from
time at Los Angeles so I'm gonna pop in
extra right onto that outer corner and
bring it all the way into the inner
corner so drama from inner to outer
corner so really deepen up the crease on
the lid area I'm gonna add this really
pretty gold from Too Faced this is the
pure gold
don't you find based on body glitter
infuse with real gold ooh for the
Mexican makeup I'm gonna go ahead and do
a wing a wing is something that they've
been doing for years and years I used to
be really high up now it's a little bit
more of a pretty flick so I'm gonna go
ahead and try to move my t-rex arms into
this position so I can do a wing so
let's get really close here I'm actually
gonna start right in the middle but I
feel like the Mexican wing is more of a
soft flick these days rather than a
harsh triangle looking thing that I also
love to do on my base is we also like
wings but ours are a little bit more
intense
see how the American wing is just a
little bit more bold and angular and
this one's more flared out now I'm gonna
do my brows before my brows driving me
nuts for the Mexican side I'm gonna go
in with precisely my brow pencil and
number six and start to darken up my
brows and fill them in the mexican brow
is pretty much an even color
there's no ombre to it it's just a nice
even natural brow Mexican women really
like to enhance their eyes deepening the
crease darkening the brow the wing
really defining the entire eye area
making it look very flirty and seductive
and just really feminine and pretty for
the American brow I'm just gonna fill it
in with shade five really quick towards
the tail-end about to do some brow
surgery right now
at 4:00 the front of the brows I'm going
to take shade 3 from benefit and just
start to fill in those hair like strokes
so going in straight down like this it's
usually like a nice gradient going on
and then I'm gonna clean up the bottom
of the brow with some concealer and just
define right underneath the brow bone so
it's gonna really highlight the arch of
the brow or the inner corner over here
this oh my god this is such a pretty
color I'm gonna use vivacious which is
this metallic color right here so I'm
gonna do something light and flirty
these are from House of lashes they're
the iconic lights and then for the
American side I'm gonna do something
along still shows you the makeup please
use this lash right here from less
saline it's called Adriana the skin is
pretty basic for me both sides are
pretty much the same so I'm gonna go
with the NARS natural radiant foundation
this is in the shade punjab and then for
the concealer I'm just gonna pop on a de
Tarte shaped tip concealer I don't think
it's any different on either side I
think it's just covering those dark
circles so I'm just gonna do just a
little bit here and the same thing right
in here and when it comes to contouring
I think both sides just pretty much like
to have a nice structure going on with
their face for the American side fake
underneath so nothing creases and then
for this side I'm just gonna add a
yellow so I'm gonna take my Kat Von D
shade and light palette whoo the yellow
powder right underneath the under eye
circle and then for the contouring I'm
just gonna keep it the same I'm using
this middle shade here from my Kat Von D
shade and light palette and I'm gonna
contour the cheeks eyes like this Sigma
wide shader brush for my nose and that
middle shade is to contour I'm slimming
down on the American side I'm gonna add
some bronzer so for the bronzer I'm
gonna use the L C bronzer in medium then
a bronze up the face take it all the way
up to forehead around the cheekbones
ron's up and glow the skin it's
basically a very sunkissed kind of aloe
so for the Mexican side I'm gonna take
the Kat Von D Lolita blush and eyeshadow
blush is a major part of the Mexican
look just live-ins up the face gives it
color it's just a very seductive flirty
kind of a culture so anything to enhance
that is what is gonna be happening on
this side of the face basically
I'm going to take the blush right back
into the hairline so it looks like it's
coming from underneath the skin I'm
gonna keep it more matte on this side
and then I'm gonna dust off that setting
powder on this eye or the lower lash
line here we always have to put a lower
lash line something so I'm just gonna
take the crease down to the lower lash
line and then I'm gonna take the darkest
Brown with the same brush and get a
little bit closer to the inner corner
and the waterline and I'm keeping it
right out here just to keep it fresh and
pretty I'm not gonna drag it all the way
in like I did on this side and I'm going
to take this is yuvan cheap magic Kohl
pencil in black and line the lower
waterline and I feel like baking and
putting that powder right underneath
kind of help stop your waterline from
running if you have that issue and then
here I'm just gonna take it a little bit
into the outer corner and leave it like
that the only thing we're missing on the
American side is highlight so I'm gonna
take the coffee and cream highlight from
ELF this is the that's heart collab
highlight that's my girl I love her I'm
gonna take both of these shades or
maximum intensity and pop them on over
there on top of the cheekbone back to
the Mexican side we are almost done the
only thing we're missing is the lipstick
or the lipstick I'm gonna take Max
retrograde and then for the American
side I'm gonna take a nude lip e this is
from Y so
