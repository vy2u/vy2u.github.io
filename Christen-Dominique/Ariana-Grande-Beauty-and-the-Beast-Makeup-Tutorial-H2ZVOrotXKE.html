to my channel so today I'm going to be
showing you how to get this ariana
grande Beauty and the Beast inspired
makeup tutorial
I loved how she looked in that video oh
my gosh if you haven't seen it has like
millions and millions of views she looks
so beautiful and just effortless and it
was such a change from what she normally
does she usually does live wing and the
high pony or half pony this time it was
like no wing just lashes straight sleek
beautiful hair she looked glowing and
gorgeous and just looked a little bit
more mature than what she normally does
but in a good way it looks so beautiful
on her so I wanted to recreate it for
you guys I also thought that this look
would be great for prom if you guys are
wanting an easy effortless elegant look
for prom also don't forget to subscribe
to my channel and hit that notification
bell so you're notified as soon as the
vo comes out and without further ado
let's get into the tutorial and without
further ado let's get into digital
tutorial I'm using the makeup forever
step one base hydrate mmm okay that's a
lot of primer can pry my arms moving so
I'm just gonna pry my face with this so
that my foundation has something nice
and smooth so on top of and my
foundation is gonna is going to last
longer I also think of primers as the
barrier between my skin care and my
makeup I like to use a really good
primer I'm gonna go in with the
hourglass vanish stick and nude
that's my shade and I'm just going to
cover my face up cover those blemishes
up this is a very matte formula if you
have dry skin I do you're going to want
to put something on there that's kind of
make it a little less drying what I'm
going to do is use this cover FX custom
infusion infusion drops this is the
hydration drops and I'm going to put
that on my TV
this kind of stick foundation honestly
would be a little bit easier to blend
with a Sun type of brush like one of
these brushes would be really great but
this one's not clean so I don't want to
use it you see there's hair on it so I'm
not going to use it there's even glitter
in there I don't know how that happened
but I'm going to use my Beauty Blender
and I'm putting some of the custom cover
infusion drops on there just to make it
less drying on the skin bouncing the
Beauty Blender you guys I'm going to see
ariana grande at the end of the month
I'm so excited I've never seen her in
concert or in person so I'm really
excited about that
or the eyeshadow I feel like it's more
of a ma be look it the lighting is super
dark so you can't really tell but I feel
like it's a little mothy on her eyes I
just got this palette in from dose of
colors it's so pretty and it's called
marvelous mobs and I thought that this
would be so perfect for not only for
prom but for the Ariana look and I'm
going to go ahead and start off with
this really pretty color right here this
is the shade Rosie start to work that
all over the crease and the outer
portion of the eye like the outer crew
outer lid I'm using circular motions I I
forgot to do my eyebrows I go on and not
do my eyebrows it's going to look weird
to me give me just a second okay we are
back with brows I feel like you guys are
going to comment on my brows I always
get a comment somebody commenting about
my brows being and even you guys can I
just tell you something I try my best
but one side of my face is a little bit
off it's like a little bit lower because
I had Bell's palsy when I was younger
and it paralyzed one side of my face so
I was paralyzed for about a month and
all of the muscles and everything were a
little bit weaker on one side so one
side is kind of lower than the other
side so um just in case you guys are
gonna comment on that I know my brows
are a little different but not everybody
is perfect okay and try to make your
brows just in the same family okay they
can be second cousins it's fine let's
get back into the eyes and now I'm
go a little bit deeper so I'm going to
take these two shades this shade is
called wishy-washy and this one is
called spaced out mix them together and
then just intensify the outer crease so
I'm using a very light hand in circular
motions right around the outer crease
the harder you press the harsher it's
going to look on your eye and it's going
to be a little bit more difficult to
blend it out so just try so you barely
touch the skin and just buff the shadow
in there now I'm going to deepen it up
with the darkest shade in the palette
which is a wine stain and start to work
that on the outer part of the crease up
here I'm keeping this the darkest shadow
away from the upper part of the crease
because I want it to look like a nice
gradient so make sure that it sits right
below the colors and then you you don't
want a harsh line of course so you can
go back with the same brush and just use
a very light hand to blend it out but if
you feel like you have too much shadow
on your brush look at that use these
little baby circular motions very soft
circular motions and what I'm going to
do is use a clean brush as the Smith
2:47 and I'm going to buff that buff
that out with this clean brush so that
there's no more product on there and it
just makes a nice soft wash there is
something in there there's something
there that wasn't there before I think
that's how it goes
and then for the inner part of the
crease I'm going to take fluffy which is
this nice light baby pink color so I'm
going to take that on a flat shader
brush which looks something like this
right here this is the zoeva 234 and
then start to press that onto my lid
then I go ahead and take this middle
shade right here wishy-washy and I'm
going to pop that onto the lower outer
part of the lash line I am really loving
this palette that eyeshadows are super
easy to blend
they're pigmented they're just beautiful
I love it there's not crazy fallout so
now I'm just going to add some mascara
to my bottom lashes I'm going to use the
triple threat mascara from pure I like
it because it's very tiny I'm going to
take cocoa bling from artist pitar and
add it to the inner corners I'm going to
take my Y 505 take any contour color you
want and I'm going to take my Smith 220
brush and just snatch that nose and I'm
going to bring it all the way up into
this area right here
take this cover FX custom and enhancer
drops this is in candlelight top that on
my cheeks and just anywhere that I want
to highlight so it comes in this little
dropper a little dot of it go ahead and
take that on the ball on my nose right
down the center Cupid's bow just keep
piling it on take this highlight and
contour palette from the balm it has
literally everything if I'm traveling I
will take this with me just because it
has everything in the palette that I
need I'm going to take these two shades
right over here so I'm just going to
take this and set my under eyes and also
give it a little bit more coverage and
brighten it up a little bit more I'm
going to bronze up my face I'm gonna use
this Smashbox Sun Tan and matte bronzer
right here swirl it around in there tap
off the excess and just work it on the
outer perimeters of the face so now that
our skin is nice and bronzy I'm gonna go
ahead and add some blush and the blush
that I'm using is actually a new one
from the balm it's called Palm Springs
so cute
this is the in full-swing blush did you
notice that Starbucks has those cute
pastel blue and green cups I wanted one
so bad but I was not feeling hot coffee
I wanted iced coffee so I didn't get one
what about these I feel like they need
to be more festive with these cups okay
so now I'm just going to work that on my
cheeks I'm going to take the dose of
colors gold is a new black highlight
with my morphe M 510 and just layer that
right on top of my cheeks like so and
then the Cupid's bow the nose and right
on the chin I'm also going to work down
on the collarbone I don't know if you
guys can see cuz I definitely cannot see
but I'm going to work that on the
collarbone as well okay for the lips I'm
going to go with the Ofra lipliner and
wine so I'm going to take oh wow that
looks really pretty
for the lipstick I'm going to take this
liquid lipstick from Kylie it's the
velvet liquid in charm actually took off
a different lip color that didn't work
so that's why my lips kind of look like
this just gonna run that right over and
that is it for the makeup this is
actually how I had my hair for prom but
also how ariana grande has a sleek
straight hair it looks so pretty and
glossy and just elegant and beautiful so
I'm gonna do that for this video I'm
actually going to use this really cool
straightening tool it's this guy right
here so this is the foxy Bay rose gold
straightening brush and this heats up to
450 degrees it gets very hot but it
doesn't burn these little guys right
here because they're not like plasticy
so I'm going to go ahead and take my
hair down I have it heated up to 450 and
I'm just going to take this piece right
here and go down my hair just double
click the power button to adjust the
temperature okay that definitely works
and it has that glossy shine to it so
I'm going to go ahead and do the next
section pull my hair out like this hold
it against the the brush and just brush
through the reason why it's so glossy
like that is because it's made with
tourmaline tourmaline tourmaline
technology you don't have to put extra
product in your hair so I'm going to
weigh your hair down and it's brushing
your hair at the same time which is
awesome wow I am like really surprised I
make very impressed honestly okay I'm
going to finish doing the rest of my
hair even if you're like getting ready
for school in the morning or work and
you just need to quickly get your hair
into shape honestly just grab this brush
and it'll do the work for you so I'm
going to do this second layer of hair
what I like to do is take the paddle
brush push my hair into the lock it into
the brush hold it against and just work
it all the way through and then I'll go
on the other side think this and then
I'll work it through again
all the way to the ends and then just
brush it all through and what I love how
this doesn't how this gives your hair at
volume mom you need this my mom she has
very kinky curly hair all the way from
the root to the tip so she usually gets
relaxers where she straightens her hair
and it takes her forever she has so much
of it and I have a discount code below
case you guys are wondering it's like
$90 off it's crazy and my code is foxy
Kristin and I'll have all that info
below so you guys can check that I
cannot believe that this straightened
all of my hair that is crazy I now have
ariana grande's straight hair from
