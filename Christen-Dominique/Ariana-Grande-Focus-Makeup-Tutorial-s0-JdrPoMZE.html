of the Sun why she's so perfect though I
literally just want to be ariana grande
one day that is the dream
so first I'm going to prime my face with
a hydrating base primer this one is from
Make Up For Ever and then I take a
little bit of fix+ and just spritz it on
I feel like it really grasped on to the
foundation and foundation last a lot
longer this way I'm taking my Kat Von D
foundation it's super full coverage I
want to look as flawless as ariana
grande skin so I'm going to take that
and it is a bit darker than my natural
face color it's just because my my body
is lot a lot darker than my face because
I've been big tanning then I'm taking
some concealer and I'm applying it
underneath my eyes to brighten this area
and also take it out to the tops of the
cheekbones so that it works as a base
for highlight and the beauty blender
works great for blending everything out
flawlessly so I suggest you use one of
those guys and then I'm going to attempt
to do the ariana grande brow so this is
my attempt what do you think and now I'm
going to start on the eyes and taking
neuter and I'm gonna basically just wash
that over all over the lid and in the
crease and then after that I am taking
buzz which is a very amazing awesome
dupe to what she used in the video I
don't know what colors to use but this
Naked 3 palette pretty much has all of
them they're definite replicas so after
that I am taking a lighter color this is
um can't read it it's blurry founded
it's the color dust so it's going to
bring a lot more light to the eyes and
also add more of that frosting look that
she had in the video now I'm going to do
the re wing and that we is super lifted
and triangular so if you're wanting to
go for the artery it's very simple very
easy also the everyday re wing is a lot
smaller than what she normally does but
in the video I was very proud of how
intense it was I couldn't think of a
word under no why would point but then I
just applied a little bit of mascara to
set our eyes for lashes and then
applying a little bit of la girls on
pencil on the liquid on the why why am i
talking backwards on the waterline
I'm gonna put some lashes on I'm using
these Lily lashes in the style of Miami
these are currently my favorite style
right now cuz they're super natural but
at the same time they still have that
drama to that so what I like to do is
pop them on to the center and then
attach one side at a time if you follow
my channel forever you know I see the
same direction to apply my lashes but
it's super easy you get it right every
time and you don't have lopsided looking
lashes and this is literally the
completed I left that was so easy so
fast and now we're going to finish the
rest of the face I'm going to take some
of my Urban Decay Naked concealer
because this is one of my favorites
all-time favorites it's actually been my
favorite throughout the year because it
just brightens it doesn't crease on me
and it blends so nicely of course using
the Beauty Blender it's that more
fabulous so then I'm just going to go
ahead and blend that into my highlighted
areas as well and once I am a bright and
light I can move on with my life and
going to set my foundation and also add
a layer of coverage I know it's a lot of
coverage for the everyday person but
we're trying to be all Rihanna Grande
today so I'm going to take my urban
decay which is my handy dandy powder and
it like makes your face look Wallace and
then for contouring I'm using the
Anastasia Beverly Hills contour shade
don't know what shade it is right now
but definitely it will be in the links
below I also like to kind of chisel out
my nose a little bit I just like to
narrow at the end of my nose a little
bit I think God for contouring
contouring is the best it's my favorite
part besides highlighting and I'm gonna
take a little bit more of a banana
powder just to highlight the inner very
inner corner of my eyes and anywhere
else I need that extra brightness now I
am going to move on to the highlight she
has a very subtle highlight it's nothing
glowy or anything like that so I'm
applying a subtle highlight this one is
from Jessica Alba's on a speedy line and
then I'm going to take a little bit of
this blush it's a matte blush and papaya
from City color and I am applying that
to my cheeks now it's time to over line
your lips until it's super uncomfortable
like uncomfortably overlying your lips
for this because her lips worse
traumatically
overlined and very nice big and juicy
looking so that's what I'm doing here I
used spiced and then I went over it with
Barry from la girl because I feel like
it here's a little bit of a punch to it
and then I applied Noble from Kat Von D
it's a matte lipstick and then to get
that like shiny wet look I applied a
butter gloss and again I don't remember
the name but I will have it as link
below for you guys
this is the look I love how it came out
at this point I was like I don't even
want to put on the wig I think it looks
so good already but I did to get the
full effect and now we're basically
twinning like ariana grande we're
already on a grounding point thank you
