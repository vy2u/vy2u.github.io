today I'm going to be doing the ariana
grande inspired hair tutorial I think
it's super cute it's very girly and just
adorable so I wanted to try it out for
you guys if you want to learn how to get
the look then keep watching so I'm
starting off with this crazy hair my
all-natural hair don't have anything in
it at all so it is really crazy and
frizzy I left my hair natural because I
feel like it takes the curl better and
it lasts longer so I didn't straighten
it or anything this is how I normally do
it if I want the style to last I'm going
to start off by putting on Bumble and
Bumble invisible oil just to help with
the frizzies so I'm going to put on a
little bit of that on the ends so don't
look so dry just going to brush through
it with my wet brush after I got this
wet brush I can't use any other brush
because it doesn't damage my hair it
doesn't hurt when I brush it if even if
I had like the craziest tangle it
doesn't hurt at all so just brushes
through softly so now I'm going to curl
my hair I'm going to just start off with
the first section here and just put it
up crazy throw it up in a crazy ball
like this I'm going to start to curl my
hair I'm not gonna spend too much time
explaining this part just because it's
super simple but I'm taking my titan-3
this is the 32 inch wand I'm just going
to curl my hair back in the ends I'm
just going to leave inch of hair out at
the bottom so like that
hey mom what are you doing
call me when you get out okay I love you
hi mamas
so now that I have my hair cold I'm
going to go ahead and put it up in the
half ponytail so I like to start it
right in front of my ear weak right here
Arianna has a really high ponytail at
the top so I'm going to start here and
then go out and angle straight up and do
that on both sides and I gather the hair
as I go around and then this side go up
I'm gonna have a lien eyes by the end of
this tutorial
already getting them it's like an
instant facelift this hair I'm going to
not worry about it too much because
we're actually going to put extensions
in this one maybe I'll just leave it
like this for your viewing entertainment
I'm going to leave that there and I'm
gonna brush up back the extensions I'm
using our from foxy locks and it comes
in this little bag I have it in what ya
extensions I keep them in this bag
they're from foxy locks and I have them
on a hanger so that they're nice and
light color that I'm currently using is
Sunkist Brown this is a 230 gram 20 inch
so as you can see I pretty much curl
them every day
this is so weird I'm holding up hair hey
guys this is my hair say hello I'm going
to use like two F's and how I'm going to
put it in I like to make things easier
on myself so basically I get the longest
wife which is the one with four Clips
like this and I'm going to brush through
that so I just lay the smaller one right
on top right underneath like this and
just clip it in
so I'm just going to take a section of
my hair in the back I'm going to do it
pretty low towards the nape of the neck
so that it looks natural
I want more fullness to my hair so I'm
going to take another section and add
another left year ago all the back is
pretty much done and it's really full
just like Ariana has and for the top I'm
going to do a baby ponytail underneath
another ponytail I'm just going to
section off a little tiny ponytail and
I'm just going to take a tiny clear
elastic God then I'm going to take some
hair and wrap it around the ponytail I'm
gonna take this one it has two clips so
I'm going to take the extension and hook
it in the back of the baby ponytail and
clip it in there and I'm going to wrap
it around like so I'm gonna hook it so
now you have this ponytail here and then
you're going to take the rest of your
hair create another ponytail over it so
it's going to look a lot fuller
okay so now that I have the ponytail
here choice wraps hair around the
ponytail so that you don't see the
elastic band I actually do the same
thing it just looks a lot cleaner just
taking a little bit of hair from the
back of your ponytail and then wrap it
to get the fullness that I need I mean I
tease the back of the hair so I'm just
going to lift a little bit up in the
back take my teasing comb to keep it so
you have there and to get that full puff
that she has the talked a little bit of
the hair and backcomb it as well
so now I'm going to lock everything in
place I'm going to take this hairspray
just to lay down like those baby hairs
now I'm done with my ariana grande hair
I love it such a cute style I love the
fullness of it it's just so girly and
just cute I love it I hope you guys love
