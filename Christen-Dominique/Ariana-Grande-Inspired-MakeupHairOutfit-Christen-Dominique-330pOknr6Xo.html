it before
trying hard
thank you
I can't pretend
hi everyone welcome back to my channel
today I'm doing the Ariana Grande
inspired outfit makeup and hair tutorial
so if you like this look then continue
watching I always like to start off my
makeup with a good moisturizer so today
I'm trying out the polished choice clear
ultra light daily mattifying moisturizer
and yes that was a mouthful I'm gonna
slather that all over my face so that
it's super hydrated for primer I'm using
the dr. brandt pores no more pore
refiner and this is going to smooth away
any imperfections and mattify my face
and it just creates a really smooth base
for the rest of my face makeup today I'm
using the benefit bigger than BB cream
to even out my complexion and I'm using
a damp Beauty Blender to work that into
my skin
you
to cover the darkness around my eyes I'm
sure you all are very familiar with it
I've been using it a lot recently it's
the honest dasya concealer it just gives
you the fullest coverage and I really
just absolutely love this product moving
on to the highlight I'm using the
benefits Watts up soft focus highlighter
and it's a champagne color and it just
gives you a beautiful glow I'm just
going to apply this to the high points
of my face tops of my cheekbones down
the bridge of my nose the center of my
chin and in between the brows I'm just
going to blend it out with my finger
okay guys I've waited so long to try
this and it's finally here I'm using the
cargo HD picture perfect powder and I
have to say it's pretty amazing I'm in
the shade 25 I really like that extra
coverage it gives you but it still has a
very natural finish now I'm taking the
honest Asya contour kit using the yellow
and pink powder to give my under eyes
some extra coverage and also extended
outwards to the tops of the cheekbones
to act as a extra highlight I'm just
going to quickly fill in my brows using
my M arched eye pencil in the color
black and I'm just gonna quickly fill
them in I'm not gonna try to look too
much like ariana grande's brows I'm just
gonna go with my natural brows and yeah
next I'm grabbing my stay don't stray
primer from benefit and just dabbing on
a bit to the center of my lid and then
blending it all the way to the top of
the brow bone
for the lid I'm taking BJ cat flying
solo shadow in the color half-naked and
since this color has a really pretty
shimmer to it I'm going to use it as a
highlight to my brow bone as well and
Ariana likes really pretty simple eye
looks so this is perf picking up the
soft and sexy color from the zoeva
palette I'm going to lightly wash this
onto the crease to add a bit more of
drama to our Ariana look and picking up
the color lovely Monday and precisely
pressing this into the crease staying
away from the lid to create a soft cut
crease and I'm going to flip my brush
around to the side with no shadow and
blend it upwards toward the brow bone
but be sure to let the light brown
washed on earlier to peak through so we
can have a nice gradient effect now it's
time for the liner and she just does a
cat eye so I'm going to do one too and
here we go I'm gonna make it super fast
because I do this a lot I do it pretty
often so if you want me to make a
separate video for an eyeliner look like
this let me know in the comments for
mascara I'm first going to prime eye
lashes with the subversion lash primer
and I'm just going to apply generous
coats and once I have that on my lashes
I'm going to take my perversion mascara
from urban decay to make sure my lashes
are bigger blacker and badder just like
the tube says
and here is your I look so far I'm just
gonna pop on some lashes and now I'm
going to add my Urban Decay 24/7 velvet
glide on pencil and plushy for a hint of
purple to the lower outer lash line
still keeping the look very simple and
very Ariana
just added my own twist to it to hydrate
the lippies I'm using the beyond natural
lip balm and grapefruit and I don't like
to eat grapefruit fun fact but the smell
this lip balm is so good
Ariana's lips are pretty much always a
nude color so I'm going to take my NYX
nude lip pencil and fill in my lips now
I'm going to go over my lips with the
Gerard cosmetics lighted lip gloss in
buttercream and I love their lip glosses
by the way they're super opaque and just
beautiful
time for some contour um yeah I got real
country right there I'm just taking my B
matte bronzer and I'm going to chisel
out the hollow of my cheeks and then I'm
going to work this up into the temple
around the forehead down alongside the
nose and we are gonna look more defined
and more beautiful to add a soft flush
of color I'm mixing the cargo blush in
tropical punch and bronze on my
cheekbone
and this is the completed ariana grande
makeup look now it's all into the hair
so I'm just gonna grab my brush to brush
out any tangles and make sure our hair
is nice and smooth and then I'm going to
take the top half of my hair and slick
it back into a pony and leave the rest
of my hair down
then I'm going to pull some hair from
the back of the pony to wrap around the
ponytail holder so that it's no longer
visible and I'm just going to take a
bobby pin or two to secure it in
Ariana does curl the ends of her hair so
I'm going to use a Bellamy wand to curl
the ends and I'm going to do this to the
bottom and the top ponytail now that my
hair is done I'm going to hydrate my
skin with a Talia cosmetics a volcano
body cream and hopefully keep my tan
lasting longer thank you guys for
