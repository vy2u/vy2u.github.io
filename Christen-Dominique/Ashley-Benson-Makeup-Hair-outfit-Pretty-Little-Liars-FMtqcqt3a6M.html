today i have my friend sona here hi guys
is makeup by sona on youtube and today
we're doing the Pretty Little Liars
makeup hair and outfit um she is doing
Lucy Hale and her name is Arya on Pretty
Little Liars and I am doing the Ashley
Benson look and her name is Hannah
honestly guys I don't we don't watch the
show we don't want to know but I love
them both they're so cute cute I think
that's why we didn't go um based off of
their looks in the actual show yeah we
went more with like their first photo
show yeah
maybe um both have inspiration photos
from photoshoots they've done which i
think is a little bit more interesting
and everyone does like the show and how
they look and i feel like the show is a
little too simple like everyday yeah so
if you want to learn how to get the Lucy
Hale look then click right here I'll put
a magical box right click it and if you
want to learn how to get this Ashley
Benson look then keep watching I'm going
to start on my foundation for my
foundation I'm going to use the Revlon
Colorstay mixed with cargo tinted
moisturizer I'm going to use my Beauty
Blender to apply this to my face and I'm
going to do this kind of like in a
stippling motion
all right so now that I've done it with
a my foundation I'm going to go ahead
and cover my dark circles today I'm
going to be using the Anastasia
concealer and this is in 1.5
okay so I'm going to start off with my
transition shade and I'm going to use
caramel and the Miami appellate I'm just
going to wash this onto my crease
also going to take this color down to
the lower lash line and blend it out for
the liner I'm using the Loreal extra
intense gel liner and I'm just lining
the top of my eye it's gonna be a little
messy and that's okay and you want
something that's very opaque and creamy
because you're going to smudge it out a
whole lot I actually ended up using the
Urban Decay perversion eyeliner so
you're gonna see that I change it later
on I was using the Loreal to align the
top lash line but actually I'm going
over it with the Urban Decay perversion
in black because it's so much more
darker than the other one
so I'm going to just do the other eye as
well and I'm going over the top oh wow
this is so dark right also going to
tightline my upper waterline but we're
going to do a liner all around the eye
the inner waterline and also the outer
part of the lash line this pencil is
super opaque and dark and really easy to
smudge so I really like it highly
suggest you guys go out and try it you
boys I'm going to take a pencil brush to
smudge out the liner you can take any
dense pointy brush that you have or even
if you have the end of a pencil brush
with a smudger on it that works really
good too
you just want to make sure it's kind of
just basically you're smoking it and
you're going to also you're gonna make
this weird face while you smoke out your
lower lash line
I'm going to go back into that caramel
color and I'm going to work it into the
crease and also blend it down into this
to the liner that we smoked out and this
is the look I'm just going to add some
mascara to my lashes and apply some of
these lashes from kiss
so the powder I'm using today is for a
hello flawless from benefit and this is
in the color of champagne I'm just going
to pick up the yellow and pink powder
from the honest on Xia contour kit
palette and go over my under-eye circles
where my contour I'm going to use the
city color contour effects palette I'm
just going to use this the darkest color
in the palette which is contour and I'm
using my zoeva 109 luxe face paint brush
mister at the hairline and just drag the
brush upwards and I'm also going to work
this around the temples in forehead
staying just around the hairline and
this next part I'm just going around the
under the chin and around the jawline
and also going alongside the nose and at
the tip just to make it straight and
less pointy with my Mac 188 brush I just
blended all the harsh lines out and with
my Anastasia highlighter I'm
highlighting the tops of my cheekbones
and down the bridge of my nose for the
blush I'm going to use the Hikari blush
in a cameo this is this really light
pink matte color
for the lips I'm going to use the
Maybelline master glaze blush stick this
is amazing the blush stick because it's
actually the perfect color for her lips
and you can you can use it for your lips
it's no big deal and then I'm going to
go over with a jar cosmetics Rose Hill
right on top of it and next I'm taking
the la girl lip paint in peony and this
gives you the perfect Ashley Benson lip
color and this is the final makeup look
and now I'm gonna do the Ashley Benson a
messy hair and here is I have the
perfect hair because it's like two days
old hair and I'm going to use my
Kerastase VIP powder volume and powder
this is basically like a dry shampoo and
I'm going to brush it through my hair
and then kind of fluff it up at the root
it's going to make you look like you
have nice clean hair and then I'm going
to take my nume 33 or thirty two
millimeter curling wand and just curl my
hair and you're good you can do it in
different directions because you want it
to look messy just grabbing random
chunks of hair probably like inch worth
it's like an inch of hair and just
curling it
so now that we're done with the big
waves I'm going to take a smaller
curling wand and do random smaller waves
throughout the hair
after you're done you just want to shake
through your hair run your fingers
through your hair so that it breaks
apart the waves and then I'm just gonna
take my Kerastase Kay spray and this is
going to give our hairs texture checking
if I don't have any white but I like
have fat upper arms so no I am the queen
of fat upper arms okay okay does my hair
