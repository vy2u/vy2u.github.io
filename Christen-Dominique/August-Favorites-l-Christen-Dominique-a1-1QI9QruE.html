doing in favorites today excuse my hair
I this like you see this bobby pin right
here I have tried to lay it down all
morning and I gave up I'm like you know
what you're just gonna be a part of my
look what do we call this my little
mohawk it's it's not working for me
today so we're just gonna have to leave
it there I'm gonna have to embrace the
mohawk if you want to check out my
giveaway because I'm giving away
everything that I am talking about today
you have to stay to the end because the
end has the details
and yeah so let's get started but first
I'm going to be talking about things
that I put on to my face and that's
didn't care I am getting I'm getting
older let's just be real I'm getting
older I'm 28 years old and I do see
little things happening to my face it's
not super drastic but I do want to keep
up with my skin so I have been using
this lumen time freeze instant lift be
shaping serum super long name I know but
it is amazing basically what it is is
really harder to convict out so
basically it lifts and firms really well
and I usually apply this after I use the
cleanser and toner I apply this to my
face pretty much every night this guy
has literally been my best friend in my
skincare routine I do this every night I
have been using this it does take 56
days to actually work because it
literally physically lifts everything
and if you have more of a mature skin
and you have deeper like wrinkles or
fine lines I have some fine lines on my
forehead they're not super deep I do
notice them this has helped so much it
has it been 56 days Wow I can actually
see the difference so I'm gonna continue
using this because really feels like it
just firms my skin and it fills in those
fine lines and so yeah I
than using this it is amazing and I use
it on my face and my neck so that is how
I use this little guy and I'm also I'm
kind of in love with the lumen brand
right now because I'm also using their
cleansing foam refreshing what is this
called the lumen refreshing cleansing
foam right here and this is a cleanser
and I also use this toner right
afterwards so this has been my nighttime
skincare routine guys to definitely
check it out and they are amazing this
stuff is so awesome
just look at the mist you see that does
this nice big misty thing like that and
it smells really good too this is the
tatcha luminous dewy skin mist and I
spray this before I apply makeup and I
spray it on my face even when I'm not
wearing makeup I'll just spray it on my
face because it makes my skin feel super
refreshed and amazing this is super
hydrating soothes my skin it makes it
feel a lot more luminous and radiant so
I really love this stuff
kind of pricey but it's definitely worth
it I feel like my skin looks a lot more
Minnis and dewy without actually having
to put on any like highlighter the
bottle is really cute and you can take
really pretty pictures with it
especially if you have gold this is boba
basically they basically took a picture
and posted boba space all over this
coffee cup it is my favorite coffee cup
right now and it says you've got to be
kidding me right now because this
inspires me then yeah that's basically
why rapping to boba with it
every time I see this I think of boba
and I just want to squeeze her little
flat face I've been drinking out of it a
lot if you notice me on snapchat talking
about this
so boba this reminds me of you I love
you I have been wearing these luxy hair
extensions for the past two months
and I am kind of obsessed with my hair
right now
in there they have made my hair feel a
lot more fuller and it looks a lot more
voluminous and I just really like it it
adds length to my hair they're very good
quality and the clips right here are
pretty sturdy I've encountered a ton of
different hair extensions that have
clips that just fall right out or the
stitching isn't right or they're not
thick enough these are the right
thickness quality's amazing the hair
lasts forever I've straightened them
curled them and done everything to them
and they're still holding up pretty well
so yeah I've been loving these these are
the dirty blonds I have them in right
now and make ponytail so this is why my
hair has been looking more voluminous
and long it's because of these
extensions that I absolutely love this
is this is like not your average
favorite but these post-it notes are so
cute I found them at CVS in the dollar
section and I grabbed a whole bunch of
these these are all over my desk I just
think they're really cute and they're
only a dollar so you know I like finding
little cute things like this so if
you're at your CVS these guys will
hopefully be there and they're only a
dollar I finally found this coffee it's
taken me about a year to find it in
k-cup form it's my favorite coffee it's
the Dunkin Donuts chocolate glazed donut
so you don't have to pack on the pounds
feel like I find everything at the bat
Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond store I've been
drinking it every day since I found it
it smells amazing
the aroma just fills your home to have
the actual grounds your whole house will
smell like chocolate glazed donut with
the cake up it's not as it doesn't fill
the house but it does kind of fill your
space with your coffee cup it smells
amazing
and it's not really that bad for you
because it's it's a it's a coffee it's
not the actual doughnut so I am so
excited about this because this is a
nail polish from my friend Laura Jeeves
super exciting I'm so proud of her and
quality is amazing I literally this is
one coat right here let me show you guys
this is one coat that I put on my nails
and it's so thick and opaque
it's like gel I want to put too because
I like thicker looking a nail polish but
I only needed one which is crazy this is
the bubblegum one I have been wearing it
pretty often but she does have a few
other colors as she does have a few
other I have I have to burn really bad
I'm just like holding it in this little
fire okay she does have a few other
colors that are also amazing there's
this baby blue one right here and these
two nudie ones and this one which is
perfect for the fall which I'm sure I'm
gonna be wearing this a lot this one is
Madrid her Instagram is lor G underscore
one for three and I'm so proud of you I
love you and I'm so excited for these
nail polishes and their amazing nail
polishes the quality is just you cannot
beat it I just bought this Kat Von D
shade light eye palette and I can use
this every single day of my life every
neutral color has that reddish brown in
there that I love for the crease as
perfect highlights right in there stark
white one a yellow one up here no
fallout on these eyeshadows and they're
super pigmented so this is my go-to
palette I'm you can turn your look from
day to night and still keep it neutral
it's like neutral glam so I have really
been liking this guy I use it all the
time
and I've got requested you a fall makeup
look with this so I may be doing that
for you guys I have a new primer and
it's the japonesque Velvet Touch primer
and I like how it just fills in all
those fine lines and pores they the way
it makes my skin look super smooth and
when I apply my foundation it goes on
really nicely ooh oh my god can you just
talk about how amazing this contour
brush is right here it's super tiny but
it gets in these little areas perfectly
look at that it just sits there does the
job for you there's really nothing to it
and if you want to get close to your
hairline you can do that and just fade
it made it inwards I love this little
brush this is the TNT 200 brush and it's
densely packed which is nice but it has
that like it's lighter towards the end
of the brush so that you can lend out
the edges super easy so you can do
everything with this brush and I don't
have to keep switching from one brush to
the other I finally found a really good
eyeliner for my waterline that stays and
it's super dark
it's the Tarte lights camera lashes
close-up lash liner it is the blackest
black you don't have to really try to
even put this on you just like sit it
down and it's like BAM right on your
waterline super dark so if you're
looking for a really good intense black
liner definitely pick up the Tarte one I
get a lot of questions on my wing all
the time and everybody asked what is
your favorite eyeliner it is definitely
hands-down Kat Von D tattoo liner and
trooper I either use this one or the
limited-edition one it's the same thing
just different packaging but it is super
sharp and you can get like a super short
sharp wing with this you can go a little
thicker in areas it's just super
effortless to get the wing that you
once my go-to lip has been this max
spice lip liner with MIDI and then Mac
on the center Mac Smith is just the
perfect combination combination I have
been wearing this lip for about a while
so this is the lip I usually hop on I am
definitely going to change the slip up
for the fall so that's why I am wearing
it every single day because I absolutely
love the combination of all of these
together for highlighter this is the
color pop super shock cheek in parasol
and it's it's a really beautiful color
it's a golden highlight and it feels
like a cream but it goes on like a
powder so I have it on right now it's
very bright and golden I just I love it
it's beautiful I have it on my inner
corners my nose and the tops of my
cheekbones top this off with the Becca
highlighter in Champagne pop by
Jacqueline Hill so these two together
I've been wearing I have them on
together right now
so together it's just super beautiful if

highlight bronzer kind of just
everything in one this is something you
definitely want to check out this is the
Physicians Formula City glow and it has
the towers of New York and they have
Paris as well the towers are highlight
they're like a gold highlight and then
the bottom is a contour which is your
darker shade and then up top is a
different shade of highlight with a
little bit of like a veiny gold going
through it so this is a really beautiful
