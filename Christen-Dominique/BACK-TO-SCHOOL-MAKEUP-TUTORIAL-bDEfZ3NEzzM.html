but getting back into this makeup look I
try to use as many affordable drugstore
products as possible there's gonna be a
few things that are not drug store and
the Kylie palette which I had to try
because it's so girly it's so pink and
glittery it's like if I was going back
to school I would want to use that
palette everything else is gonna be
drugstores whoo
affordable so I am going to show you how
to get this look if you want to learn
how to get it subscribe to my channel
hit that notification bow so you can be
a part of the club family and without
further ado we're gonna get onto the
video saying that I'm gonna do to my
face if throw on some primer because I
don't want my face slipping off by the
end of the day so I'm gonna put this NYX
angel veil primer this is great if you
have oily skin because this is oil free
and it's just gonna modify your entire
face this stuff kind of makes you feel
like you're putting on like if baby
powder was in cream form this is what it
would feel like I'm gonna put on my
foundation first and then I'm gonna do
my brows so the foundation that I'm
using today I'm trying to use as much
drugstore and affordable products as
possible I'm gonna be using the
covergirl vitalist healthy elixir I'm
using the shade medium beige today this
is the first time that I'm using a
covergirl foundation in either ever or
in years I I can't cuz I don't use a lot
of covergirl so I don't really know but
I definitely use covergirl before in the
past but not a foundation so let's see
what this is gonna look like it's
supposed to be like a medium full
coverage and let's just see how this
works out for us my face is lighter than
my body because I do tan and I exfoliate
my face pretty often so that's why it's
a totally different color but we're
gonna work it down into our neck and see
how this goes you definitely want to
test out anything new the day before
school or a week before school just in
case just so you know you like it so the
first day of school you walk in you're
not like you don't have any surprises
this is my first time using it and you
guys can see if you want to use it
depending on how I like it or how it
looks on my face so this seems to blend
into my skin pretty good I was a little
skeptical at first it's like a pinkish
undertone but I really don't mind it
it's blending into my skin pretty well
and if you happen to get the wrong shade
and you're like I don't have any other
foundation just blend it all the way
down into the into the inside of your
shirt and you'll be good don't ever you
know ever put it on your hand
and try to act like it's your skintone
because then that might be look really
messy and just really weird just but let
it definitely blend it down into your
shirts so that you can't see any line of
demarcation on your face I'm actually
not gonna use a drugstore for the brows
this is the Anastasia brow Wiz in soft
brown I feel like a pencil is easier in
the morning when you're about to go to
school you don't wanna sit there and do
like the pomade and everything so I'm
gonna go ahead and fill that in I have
some sparse areas where it here
and now we are going to conceal the eye
area so we can look like we woke up this
morning I just got these in from
colour-pop these are the new no filter
concealers and they have so many
freaking shapes to choose from but this
one was the yellowest looking one you
like my description this is the light 20
and just work it down on my under-eye
I'm gonna work this onto my lid and kind
of Pat it in there so this could be the
base for the eyeshadow I'm super
ecstatic about this eyeshadow palette
that I'm about to use this is the Kylie
birthday Collection the I wanted all
palettes so so what I'm gonna do first
of course is use buttercream frosting
because this one is the most neutral
skin tone kind of shade so I'm going to
use that as you guys know pop it all
over the lid just to make sure
everything is set in place this I love
how this eye shadow barely has any
fallout at all if you don't have this
palette that's fine you can just choose
colors that are similar I'm sure you can
find them I mean there's just pink mobs
and bronzy colors okay so the next color
I'm going to use is Forever Young and
I'm gonna whip that all over the lid up
into the crease it's just a really
pretty pink color blend the ends of this
shadow out the next color I'm going to
take is party time right here the Mabi
shade
so now we have like a really nice pink
pretty bass so after that I'm just gonna
layer on 1942 or this pink shade is
gonna peek through all of these shades
we're going on the lid patting it onto
the lid and then we're working it up
into the crease this is gonna look like
your eyes you just have this glowing
effect it's so pretty the inner corners
I'm gonna take birthday girl so I'm
gonna go on with this to my lashline we
see it's like it's not super intense but
it is adding some definition to that
lash line so we can put on some lashes
my new favorite mascara from the
drugstore is from laurie alice is the
voluminous lash and it just works
miracles for your lashes I'm gonna start
at the base wiggle and wiggle to the top
if you have really tiny lashes and your
parents won't let you wear lashes yet
like false lashes or just don't have
time for false lashes brush your lashes
in the opposite direction and down
and then up and then BAM your lashes are
gonna look fuller than they have ever
looked in your life especially with this
mascara open your mouth like Miranda
sings so you can get into those bottom
lashes without touching the skin that is
that is the goal
don't touch the skin and you can stop
there but I'm going to put on some false
lashes that are very natural-looking
from Lily lashes these are opulence
these are the opulence okay there we go
these are the lashes they're super
natural you can see very wispy long and
flirty these are the opulence lashes
from a Lulu lashes they're just so
pretty
I'm going to put these on my lash line
and I will be right okay we are done
with the eyes I'm gonna move on to set
everything in place I'm gonna use the
pure cosmetics contour diaries that I
break it so what I'm going to use is
this yellow powder right here to set
everything underneath the eyes what is
that gray thing
take that shade and just contour the
cheeks you can actually use this to
bronze I feel like depending on your
skin tone so I'm gonna take my morphe
m57
to brush and I'm gonna contour my nose
if you feel like your nose a little too
pointy
you can always go down here to round it
out with a contour color that's like a
natural shadow underneath your nose so
it'll give you the illusion of a rounded
nose or that your nose just stops and
your nose is a little bit shorter than
what it was before
I love contouring I could do this all
day use the hoola bronzer just so it
looks like we stepped outside this
summer and we weren't inside online all
day to have fun in the Sun so I'm gonna
take that with the Kylie brush right
here pop that on my cheeks the last step
on the face we're gonna do is the
highlight it's like if the one in the
palate a little bit too glittery and
especially for school I found a gem in
the drugstore this is from Maybelline
this is the new chrome master chrome
metallic highlighter it is literally
butter highlight on your face I'm just
gonna put it on with my finger so I'm
put a little bit on my nose keep its bow
tie and right on the high points of my
cheekbones somebody is the 20 lip liner
and matte liquid lipstick so first time
I put on the liner blot my lips once
just so it's not super intense looking
at this look I want to add a liner I
know I said I wasn't and you don't have
to but I'm gonna add a liner I feel like
it needs it so I'm gonna take this brown
liner in Mad Max Brown from Kat Von D
I feel like the liner just really
brought this look together so I'm
actually really happy that I put the
liner on if you don't want you you don't
