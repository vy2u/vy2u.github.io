today I'm gonna be showing you the best
the best full coverage concealers that
you can ever imagine I have been through
so many different concealers I think
I've tried everything in Sephora
everything in Ulta online drugstore I've
tried it all and I have been an on a
hunt for the most full coverage
concealer since I started wearing makeup
but I was always really teased for my
under-eye circles so that's what
actually made me Stu want to start
putting makeup on I wasn't allowed but I
grabbed my mom's concealer it was super
bright yellow and I put it on and I felt
so much better that day if I was
stranded on a desert island and I can
only have one makeup product it would be
concealer I know brows is a big thing
but I don't even care don't don't get me
brows don't give me mascara just give me
concealer so I am gonna show you some of
the best full coverage is out there in
concealers and I'm giving you high-end
drugstore indie brands but on a budget I
got you and without further ado let's
get in to the video so the first
concealer I'm gonna talk about is the
Tarte shaped Cape this is one that is
loved by many beauty gurus on YouTube it
is actually very highly rated as well
online so this is not just a hyped up
concealer it actually works really well
for covering intensely deep dark circles
the applicator is a little bit larger
than normal it's like a doe foot
applicator it will get a larger surface
at one time which is kind of good
because you can just put it on basically
covered your whole and tri circle and
then blend it in with a Beauty Blender
or your finger it doesn't crease as much
as any other concealer I've ever found I
do have a few lines under my eyes it's
not crazy bad but it does not crease on
me to me this concealer is a little
heavy on the skin it is drying but it is
super full coverage if you're wanting to
cover those under-eye circles and it
doesn't crease so the next concealer I'm
gonna tell you about is one that I have
not been able to put down and I have bit
I was a little skeptical getting this in
to be honest there's some products that
I actually really really love from k'kaw
some that I don't love so much and this
is one of them that was a little
skeptical on because I
a high expectation when it comes to my
under-eye concealers so when I got this
I was so surprised this is such an
amazing concealer I have not been able
to put it down I've worn it every single
day I have it on right now
I like that it's extremely full coverage
but it doesn't feel heavy it's very
light and it feels hydrating on the eyes
and I have really dry skin so under my
eyes especially because it's a thin area
needs to have the most hydrating element
to it so this definitely has that and I
really love the applicator it's a tiny
little applicator but it is also very
soft and it just kind of bends easy so
you can really get a precise area of
size line where you want to put this
contour at and you can make whole shapes
with it it's I really like it I enjoy
using it so with this one you definitely
have to set it in place because it will
create those creases in your eyes just
because I think it's a little bit more
hydrating so it's a little thinner and
really just kind of finds its way into
those little grooves if I ever run out
of this guy I'm definitely picking it up
again last high-end kind of concealer is
the Mac Studio water weight concealer
this one I I need a new one because I
couldn't put it down I use this for
about two months straight now this one
out of every concealer I talked about in
this video is the most lightweight
literally it is like water but it's the
most full coverage concealer it's magic
because I've never found a concealer
that is this light and this like airy
and hydrating but at the same time
extremely full coverage you know I love
my full coverage foundations so that's
why I kind of gravitate towards using
this water weight concealer at first I
was like this is not gonna work this is
like water
I've tried their other stuff that says
like bear and water in it it's not any
type of coverage this one will make you
gasp because it is really full coverage
and it's very lightweight and airy and
it feels great so it also lasts a really
long time and it comes in this little
dropper so it's fun to use honestly if
you watch those Instagram videos and
want to make
face look like it's crying concealer you
can definitely do that with this one I
just I think it's a fun concealer it's
extreme full coverage and it just
becomes one with your skin so well it
just makes me want to cry alright so now
we're getting in to the drugstore slash
affordable concealers I'm saying
affordable because these are not some of
these are not at the drugstore you'll
have to buy them online but they are
very reasonably priced and extremely
full coverage and one that I'm super
excited to talk about is the revolution
and makeup conceal and define full
coverage conceal and contour concealer
everybody on YouTube have said that this
is a dupe for the tart shade tape and
I'm going to say that I definitely agree
because it's literally the same thing
but cheaper this is only seven dollars
the applicator is a lot longer and not
as thick I haven't done a wear test on
this that's the only thing about this
guy you definitely get more product with
the tar schmoop tape but you get the
same type of coverage with this guy it
feels the same on the skin it's a little
drawing but very full a little heavy
feeling and for me I liked it I can't
remember if it lasts throughout the day
you can have the darkest under-eye
circle and it just blends into the skin
is so nice I'm gonna actually put
heart-shaped tape next to this one and
the makeup revolution end results so you
guys can see the difference there really
isn't a difference because they're the
same thing so yeah this is another
really amazing concealer that is
affordable and that you do have to buy
online okay so the next concealers from
la girl it's the pro conceal HD
concealer so you can get this at Ulta
it's $4.99 I have never met a concealer
this cheap and this good it is so so
affordable if I were to think a five
dollar concealer that's not gonna work I
would not even think about trying that
but this guy is so high full coverage
it's insane you have to try this if
you're on a budget and you need a good
concealer
this is definitely one for you so
definitely pick this up it is amazing
I'm putting it on right now so you can
show you the before and the after so the
next concealer I'm going to talk about
is one that you can find in the
drugstore it's called the Maybelline
master conceal this one is more of a
light weight feel it's just so easy to
apply you just put like a piece I'd not
even a pea sized you could put like a
rice sized amount and you get a lot very
full coverage light weight it leaves
your skin looking smooth so it somehow
fills in and plumps the under eyes which
is another great thing and I can't
believe I'm talking about this one last
I guess saving the best for last but
it's a lot cleaner to use and you don't
waste a lot of products so that pretty
much sums up all of the best concealers
out there trust me I have tried a lot of
them all of them and these are your
writer guys right here don't forget to
