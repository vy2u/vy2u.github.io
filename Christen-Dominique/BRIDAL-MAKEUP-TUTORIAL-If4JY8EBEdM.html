bridle here okay now let's take this
necklace out of my hair
hey guys welcome back to my channel I'm
so excited to show you my makeup look
today because it is sweat proof glowing
Bridal makeup that is so timely they're
gonna look like your best self and I'm
so excited to show you if you're getting
married congratulations you are gonna
have a lifetime a bun and some work I
got married about six years ago and I
definitely have a lot of tips and tricks
for you guys for looking beautiful
without makeup and also health-wise your
body your mind your soul everything I
have all the tips and tricks for you
guys stay tuned if you want to see how
to get this look right here and don't
forget to subscribe to my channel and
hit that notification bell so you can be
a part of the quad family and without
further ado let's go ahead and get into
the make sure you have very clean skin
and sure hydrated so I would a tip I
would give you guys is to make sure that
you are drinking plenty of water for the
entire week I wouldn't drink anything
else but water just so that your body
from the inside out is very hydrated
your skin's gonna look a lot better your
teeth your everything and also having a
very clean polished face just clean skin
is so important my wedding morning would
definitely start with a shower and one
of my favorite body washes to use is the
Olay Micro scrubbing cleansing infusion
hydrating glow body wash with crushed
ginger it smells amazing it has little
micro exfoliators that exfoliates your
skin as you wash it and it just leaves
you this really beautiful glowing supple
looking skin and it has the most amazing
scent to it and I also like to use the
cleansing infusion hydrating glow facial
cleanser the reason I liked using them
is because they both contain tiny
exfoliators that break down as you wash
so it's creating this micro polishing
effect that remakes your skin it looks
so glowing and beautiful and it's that
scent lasts all day long on your face on
your body it's the most clean subtle
beautiful scent from a body wash and a
cleanser it's just one of my favorites I
would definitely recommend you guys use
those two things on your body and on
your face just so everything is nice and
clean there's no dead skin laying around
or flaking around on your face or body
so you're left with smooth
healthy-looking skin and then you can
start on your makeup but skin care is
super super important so make sure that
you don't forget to drink a lot of water
I actually also before I started you can
see my lips are kind of shiny because I
used the lips lip from Sarah Happ she
has some of the most amazing lip balms
it's just like this and I put it on
right when I woke up after I brush my
teeth and wash my face I put that on
immediately and it's still very shiny my
lips are super hydrated right now but
I'm gonna go ahead and use the farce
Ollie volcanic elixir drops on my face
it says to use this at night but I
really love the way my makeup applies
right on top when I use it just before I
put on foundation so I'm gonna do my
foundation first and I'm also going to
do like my concealer so I'm gonna start
off with that and since our eyes are
gonna be like a natural glam kind of eye
so I don't have to worry about getting
too much eye shadow everywhere so I'm
gonna do my foundation first and
foundation on your wedding day is very
personal to you for me personally I like
full coverage and I like something
that's gonna smooth out my skin
instantly but if you you don't have much
texture on your skin or maybe you just
have a little blemishes here and there
then you can do something a little bit
lighter some people don't like heavy
foundation so definitely use something
that is lighter that is suitable for
your skin type for me my favorite right
now is these you a high coverage
essential high coverage foundation and
I'm in the shade almond if I'm taking
pictures all day I want my skin to look
the best so if you have kind of my skin
type I would suggest you use as you
weigh a high coverage foundation and
this foundation is one of those that's
not really gonna budge or move anywhere
and you don't need a lot of it if you're
doing your makeup or if somebody else is
doing it for you you want to make sure
that you have the most cleanest Beauty
Blender you can ever imagine if you like
using Beauty blenders I would recommend
you guys use a Beauty Blender because
it's one of the best tools to make your
skin look flawless it soaks up the
excess product so it's not like it's not
gonna look gunky or flaky or weird it's
just gonna smooth into your skin so nice
and even
this is one of my favorite things to put
foundation on with I'm just gonna tap it
in all over my face also another tip for
you guys if you have sensitive eyes when
you're putting on your makeup on this
day it just be extremely light with
anything from foundation concealer or
anything like that around your eye area
because it will cry and it will ruin
your makeup so just make sure that you
are very light handed around your eye
area anytime anyone else does my makeup
my eye always cries just because it's
not used to the pressure just a tip for
you guys that have sensitive eyes just
like me be very soft around your eyes
this foundation amazes me I'm like wow I
love love this foundation okay so now
I'm gonna go ahead and do my concealer
so I'm gonna take shade 5 from the k'kaw
concealer and just start from here and
go down and out like that and one more
I'm gonna go right in the center of my
forehead these are all places that we
want a light to hit we want these to
look the brightest if you don't really
brighten and contour on your wedding day
for pictures your face can look a little
flat and it loses dimension so you're
putting dimension like extra dimension
right back in there so when you take
pictures no matter what lighting your
your face is gonna look fully defined
and beautiful so don't forget to contour
on your day and conceal and today I
don't normally do this on an everyday
basis but today I'm gonna also contour
with a cream as well but I'm gonna do
this part first you can do either or you
can contour first or you can brighten
first I'm just gonna brighten really
quick so right in the middle of the
forehead down the nose and then I like
to lift this area up a little bit so I
put it right there
and then to contour I'm going to use the
Smashbox to do skin shaping foundation
now one side is a foundation but I'd
rather use these your way once it's more
full coverage but I do like the shade of
this one this is shade 2.2 and I like
the curves so I'm just gonna go down the
nose this is gonna be a really nice base
for our contour to go right across to
giving me that button nose looking
effect and right underneath I'm going
underneath just to make my nose look
less and more rounded then I go right
along this side like this if you want
more structure around your jaw line you
can go right underneath your jaw and
underneath blend it in and when you
blend you want to make sure you are
going up first I just Pat it into the
skin and then I move it executes my
little Beauty Blender upwards same thing
here I'm just tapping it in first this
kind of softens it up too when you just
tap it and once you have it tapped in
and then you need sometimes you don't
even need to move it around that I like
to push it downwards this is going to
make the sides of the nose a little bit
less wide it's gonna like it look a
little more narrow so I do that top top
top same thing here you just want to tap
it in first now you have more structure
to your face no matter how much powder
you put on for the eyes I'm going to be
using the Dominique latte palette so I'm
gonna start off with caramel
and go into hazelnut as well so I'm
going to take the makeup shock t67 brush
and just pop into caramel and hazelnut
I'm gonna take these two guys and work
them on the outer part of the eye like
this and make sure my hand is kind of
further back and they're just gonna do
these circular motions on the outer part
of the eye and then go right in back and
forth I want to keep it further out so
it gives you more of a sultry elongated
eye you can start off a little soft like
that just gives you a very soft you know
it's definition and then build that up
and I think it's so important to be able
to start off with just a light flush of
color and then work your way up now I'm
just gonna blend out the edges with this
brush over here and then with a smaller
densely-packed brush this is the Mac 239
just a flat shader brush like this I'm
gonna take hazelnut and layer that in my
crease and blend it upwards then blend
it out as you go to and then I'm gonna
go into mocha which is this dark brown
right here and then I'm gonna layer that
in my crease I'm gonna go in with
vanilla cream the shade right here just
go right underneath my brow bone with it
if you blend it downwards like this you
also soften the edge of the darker
shades and then for the inner corners
I'm gonna use espresso this shade right
here I'm gonna pop that into this inner
third area and then right on the inner
corners of my eyes I'm gonna take
macchiato which is the lightest foil
shimmer in the palettes I'm gonna take
this guy right here which is really
pretty as a highlight too and then I'm
just gonna do a little bit of the brown
shadow mocha on the lash line kind of
like creating a little bit of a wing
with a shadow and this is gonna give
your I am more of a lifted sultry effect
and then I'm also gonna bring mocha down
to the lower lash line with the same
brush but I'm not gonna take it in I'm
seeing take it about half way the eye
still looks very open and then with a
clean brush this is the iconic London
I'm just gonna go right below it and
just make sure there isn't any harsh
edges and then for the liner I'm just
gonna do a brow
winged the liner for weddings I
personally prefer to use brown eyeliner
so I'm going to take a brown cream liner
and just line up the top line just very
close to the lashes
leaving the liner right about where your
pupil ends gives you more of a wide-eyed
kind of look at the same time you have
that lifted sultry look on your outer
part of the eye and just the whole eyes
are just gonna look so endearing and
beautiful so I like to keep it right
about there so you're gonna be tearing
up the entire time because this is a
very special moment in your life and you
want to make sure everything is
waterproof from your face to your eyes
everything has to be waterproof so I'm
gonna be using the better than sex
waterproof mascara from Too Faced well
my skin looks really glowy and I have a
matte foundation on so definitely those
steps that I did before are super and
important because my skin still looks
really glowy I love that just because
you did brown liner does not mean you
have to do Brown at mascara I personally
like the contrast from the black lashes
to the brown soft eye for lashes I'm
going to use these guys right here these
are the huda beauty Camile lashes and I
like them because they're wispy and
they're half lashes they're not all the
way in so and because our liner stops
out there so you can't go wrong if
you're using these types of lashes
they're just easier to apply when you're
doing your lashes make sure you just let
them sit for about 20 to 30 seconds so
while that's happening that's drying up
I'm going to do my brows because my
brows are like use the powder so this is
the foolproof brow powder from benefit
powders just softer more natural and so
I'm just gonna go over them lightly with
powder and then I'm gonna go in again
with a pencil because you don't want
your lashes to completely dry on you I'm
gonna take my lash and pop it on my eye
now with my finger I'm just gonna pinch
my lashes together I'm gonna look down
I'm gonna softly just push the lash
together okay so I'm gonna go back to my
brows and fill them in the shade number
five from gonna fit and I'm just gonna
softly add a little bit more brow to the
tail end and I would also suggest
because I already have makeup all over
the collar of my robe don't put your
makeup on in your wedding dress
definitely wear something that you can
wash I'm gonna go ahead and bake with
the k'kaw number to eight and I'm just
gonna go right underneath
I like this and right there just make
sure we're extra lifted in those spots
and while I'm baking I'm gonna do a
little bit of powder contour so I'm
gonna take my Kat Von D shade and light
palette at the middle shade from Kat Von
D and I just go right where the hollow
is and I would stop like right here I
just want a little bit of extra
dimension nothing too crazy and since we
have that base contour we don't need to
do too much with it we're just adding a
little extra dimension this is the
Brighton so I'm going to take number one
I'm just really gonna use my finger I'm
gonna set that on my nose and down the
center okay so I'm gonna wipe this away
now all around the under-eye area it's
gonna look really nice and smooth and
I'm gonna go over the nose just a little
bit so it doesn't you know look like a
bunch of dark contoured lines and a
mixing vanilla cream and number one I'm
gonna go right underneath the under eyes
you can grab your favorite bronzer I'm
gonna use this one from thrive cosmetics
cuz it also has like a blurring effect
in it is one of my favorite ones it has
little shimmers in it but you can't see
it just makes your skin look very soft
and just add a little bit on the cheeks
and around the temple and then I'm gonna
go ahead and take my tart slush it's a
matte blush I love matte blushes for the
face it's just very softening on the
cheek area especially if you have like
texture on your cheek it's best to use
something that's more matte so this is
the shade seduced there for the
highlight I'm going to use the Dior nude
air Luminizer and the shade number one
down the nose and on the Cupid's bow for
lips i'm gonna use this really pretty
nudey pink liquid lip from colour-pop
it's called low pump and it's just a
really pretty natural pink and I prefer
to use a liquid lip over a cream
lipstick or anything creamy because then
it's just going to potentially slide and
get in places that you don't want it to
especially if you're gonna be giving
hugs and kisses and stuff like that it's
just gonna come off very easy so I'm
gonna take this makeup forever in the
shade number eleven and go along the
edges I'm gonna take the lip stroke from
huda beauty in the shade ritzy and you
don't need a lot of this you just need a
little bit and I'm gonna put some right
here Pat your lips since I want it in a
more targeted area I would just Pat it
in with your finger so now that all of
our face is done you want to end with a
setting spray so I'm going to go ahead
and take my Urban Decay all nighter it
a very good one and this is the final
look
thanks for watching and I hope you
enjoyed this video if you liked it go
ahead and give me a thumbs up and before
I let you go I just want to let you know
if you're out there you're about to get
married nothing is going to be perfect
best relationships are super imperfect
and you just learn how to work with each
other nobody's going to be the exact
same so being in a relationship is a lot
of work just remember that you will have
to compromise in your relationship if
you truly love that person I love you
guys I wish you all the best and I will
see you in my next video bye Dolly's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
