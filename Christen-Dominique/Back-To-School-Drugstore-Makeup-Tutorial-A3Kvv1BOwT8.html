hey guys
China I had my finger it just has to
last for this video
these are press-on nails your notice
that I lose this nail like 30 times
ah yes I handle so today I'm going to be
doing this back-to-school drugstore
makeup look I wanted to do something
that is very affordable something that
you can buy a Walmart Target CVS forever
makeup so expensive so I want to do
something that was just all over
affordable also I know if you're in
school you're probably in college and
you're saving money or you're in high
school and you've to ask your parents
for money so I wanted something that's
getting really affordable for you guy do
this look that you can do every day for
school I feel like personally I feel
like it's very easy you can pick and
choose what you want to use in this look
you don't have to do everything you
don't have to put on a wing liner you
can just put on mascara do whatever
customize it to how you're comfortable
if you like this look and you want to
see how to get this look on my face then
you are gonna start off with is priming
our face domine is the baby skin instant
pore eraser primer I feel like this is
so similar to the Smashbox primer I
think it's the photo finish
HD primer this is going to help fill in
all the pores make sure that your skin
is nice and smooth when I run my fingers
across it so that means my foundation
and anything that I put on tops is going
to go on like butter also another trick
so that your makeup lasts is to apply a
setting spray before you start and then
afterwards your makeup is not going to
move at all during school it's gonna
stay put
whoo I'm excited about this one this is
my first time trying the Maylene matte
poreless foundation and are the
Maybelline fit me matte poreless
foundation I just got this in this is
the shade soft tan in 228 so I'm gonna
go ahead and put that on with my eye
sonic brush I put some on the back of my
oh my god oh my goodness I have a mixing
plate that I totally forgot about I used
it on what am i when I was doing an
Instagram video tutorial and so I'd
really forgot to use it so I didn't have
to mess up my hand but that's fine so
I'm going to apply it with my iconic
brush right here you start to work it
into my face I got excited because it
said matte and poreless and matte and
poreless to me sounds like skin dream so
I was excited about that and this is the
shade soft hand and I'm like I'm a soft
tan I think that works I just hand I
just lost a nail I hit film before it
just has to lash for this video that's
it
you just have to last for this video and
then we're that you just pretend like
there's it's not there and you follow me
on snapchat you know what happened just
you know everything about me they're
right here so you guys can follow me
insight on what's going on in my day to
day life so next step I'm going to use
some concealer I mean both of them and a
light medium one and a light one I'm
going to mix them together on my mixing
plate and I'm going to focus the
concealer right on the inner corner you
see how it gets really deep it has like
a big dip and then I'm going to bring it
all the way down the side of my nose
press it into my skin and push it out to
the top of my cheekbone in high school
what I used to do I used to follow my
under eye circles actually talked about
this in my last video my do's and don'ts
video and I kind of go into more detail
on what my suggestion is to have a
cleaner looking flawless makeup look we
want to get more information about that
I will have it linked below so you guys
can check it out basically you're
creating the illusion that you don't
have a very defined a circle here that's
why you bring it down a little bit so
the eyes distracted by that light right
in this area
if you want to you can also use this as
a base highlight so just making this
part of your face a little bit brighter
right down the center of the nose and
tops of the lip and chin you don't even
have to highlight if you do this if you
want more of a natural-looking highlight
you can just use this and just put
powder over it but if you want your
highlight to look a little bit more
intense you can go ahead and do this
also and put highlight over it and it'll
look a lot more prominent in those areas
mmm another thing you can do with your
concealer is use it as a primer and I'm
already using concealer so I feel like I
can just do it with concealer and get
the same effect it's gonna make your
eyeshadow look a little bit more vibrant
it's gonna make it really stick on and
last a little bit longer I'm gonna blend
that in to my skin I'm just going to
hydrate my lips a little bit with these
big lips such a cute little package I'm
sore a little dry and then I'm going to
go ahead and do my brows this brow
precise micro pencil right here gonna
notice that I'm focusing the pencil on
the areas that I don't have very much
hair and staying away from the areas
where I have a ton of hair because then
it's gonna look uneven if you want to
add a few more hairs in the front I
would suggest use the lightest feathery
touch like if you're scared of it that's
when you know you're doing it right so
you just take your pencil and just use
light upward strokes a little bit of
them don't go crazy because you don't
want to end up with a box
i'ma wipe off the excess powder that's
going to prevent our under eyes from
creasing for the eyeshadow today I'm
going to be using this elf palette it is
the perfect palette this is the palette
you would need all year like you can use
this every single day if you want to do
a little bit of a soft glam if you want
to go to school with a full-on smokey
eye it's up to you you can definitely do
it with this palette okay I'm gonna
start off with the lightest shade in the
palette which is this one right here I'm
going to just brush that all over my lid
so all the way from the
lid up to the eyebrow so the next year
I'm going to pick up is this one right
here I'm going to use my morphe m4 12
brush will work this on to the crease
it's going to just add some natural
definition to your eye and I'm going to
work this in windshield wiper motions
back and forth on my crease and I'm
using a light hand so that in case I
want to go a little bit deeper I can do
that I want to focus more definition on
the outer part of the eye and bring
light into the inner corners so I'm
going to leave it pretty wide open there
okay so the next shader my go into is
this darker shade of brown right here
and I'm just going to deepen up the
outer part of the crease with using the
same brush and I really like this brush
for the crease by the way this is need
morphe m41 too and it is just you see
that point it just gets right where you
need to be so now I'm going to focus the
darker shade right below it closer to
the crease and then I'm just going to
tap my brush just a little bit into this
darker Brown right here just a little
dot and then I'm going to work that into
circular motion on the outer corner just
so that it is the darkest right here
right there and then if you're not so
great at blending out your eyeshadow or
you feel like you have so much product
on one brush go ahead and take a new
brush this is a clean fluffy brush
softly blend out the edges it's going to
help everything look seamless and I go
ahead and do the other side make sure
there is no harsh edges I'm just going
to go ahead and take some of that same
shadow we used earlier on a flat shader
brush I just want to intensify that lid
color I'm going to use this brush
because it's more densely packed so what
that means is that you're going to have
more product on your brush and you're
going to get more product in one spot so
I'm going to go ahead you see how that
is like very intense so now I'm just
going to press the shadow move it around
so that you even it out with that same
color I'm gonna go ahead and do the brow
bone I
a little bit for my highlight I'm going
to use this wet and wild highlight and
also use this on my face later but it's
this geometric highlighting palette and
I'm just going to go ahead and work my
pencil brush into all of those shades
like so this is the zoeva 230 luxe
pencil brush by the ways in case you
guys are wondering I'm going to go ahead
and pop it into the inner corners you
see how it does that it's like a subtle
pop it just so the next thing I'm going
to do is I'm going to take everything
that I have on the crease and also apply
it to the lower part of the lash line
I'm just going to keep it on the outer
part I'm not going to bring it all the
way in so while I do that let's cue the
music I give up
so next I'm going to do a wing I'm going
to use the NYX vinyl liquid liner if
you're looking for an inexpensive liner
that works really really good you have a
lot of control this one and the NYC one
are both really really good for mascara
I'm going to use the lash sensational
from a bleeps gonna cut my lashes and
then I'm gonna apply some false lashes
you don't have to do this if you already
have long fluffy lashes
I'm not saying to put my lashes on every
morning personally if it was me I would
be putting them on every morning but
that's just me you're in a rush would
ever skip the lashes you don't need them
just put on a really good mascara I just
figured something out if you have one of
these brushes use the brushy side
because I just comb through my bottom
lashes I brushed it down I was like whoa
there's no more clumps so if you have
one of these keep it you don't have to
do this but I'm gonna go ahead and line
my inner rim with the NYX wonder pencil
it's just a nude eyeliner pencil and I'm
going to put it right on the inner
corners just so that my eyes look a
little bit more brighter and awake
they're awake right now but just in case
in the mornings when you're like super
sleepy and you feel like your eyes look
a little tired go ahead and put some of
this nude eyeliner on and it'll make
them look instantly
oh wait that's it for the eyes it's so
simple super easy I'm gonna go ahead and
move on to my face I'm gonna contour so
I'm gonna take this NYX face duo sculpt
and highlight right here and go ahead
and use this one since like a very ashy
gray tone color so that's the kind of
color you want to go for when you are
contouring your face a little V's right
here now it's going to slim it down a
lot do you want you can also do your
cheek bone if you have time to contour
your face go ahead and contour if you
don't don't worry about it you know you
have to do it and use my Beauty Blender
it's too blended oh yes that was my nail
falling for the 800th time in this video
so the next thing I'm going to do is
highlight I'm going to use this strobing
stick and light am just going to apply
some right here
right here right where the light would
hit my cheeks here and then I'm gonna
blend it in with my finger I'm gonna set
my makeup with these Matt fit me matte
and poreless powder this is in Sun beige
and then I'm going to take this lighter
powder it's the same powder just in a
lighter shade this is in classic ivory
this is to writing out the t-zone I'm
just going to use this lighter shade of
powder the next thing I'm going to do is
my blush for the blush I'm going to use
this beautiful beautiful beautiful blush
it's from Milani that looks like just
ignore this finger that just looks like
a rose it's so so pretty I'm gonna use
my favorite blush brush this is from NYX
it's like a duo fiber brush the perfect
brush should put on blush on the perfect
brush to put on blush if you want the
most natural-looking blush keep it
behind the apples of your cheekbones and
using a duo fiber brush like this is
gonna give you the like almost like an
airbrush finish gives you the most
natural airbrushed looking finish so
just keep it right behind the apples of
your cheekbones and then I'm going to go
ahead and use my Physicians Formula
butter bronzer can we just stop and take
a minute to smell you can't smell this
smells so good it smells like almost
like coconutty
it's a bronzer so I'm gonna warm up my
face a little bit with this and just
start to bring a little bit of warmth to
my face so I'm going to take my zoeva
fan brush work it into this highlight
right here and just put it on the areas
where the light would naturally hit my
face I personally put highlight right on
my chin because my face is pretty dry
put a little bit on my chin so it looks
a little bit more dewy for the lips I
have this elf lipstick in the shade of
pink and I'm gonna use that on my lips
