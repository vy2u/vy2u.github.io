today I'm doing a back to school makeup
look for you I hope you like the look
and wear it to college to high school to
the grocery store really anywhere
because it's pretty everyday so here it
is I hope you guys enjoy the video to
pry my face today I'm using the pure
minerals correcting primer to make sure
we have a smooth canvas to work with to
even out my skin I'm using the Laneige
BB cushion it's quick and easy and I
just take the pad and press it into the
cushion drenched in BB cream and then I
just Pat it onto my face and honestly
guys if you don't need any more coverage
you can pretty much stop here but I feel
like I do need a bit more so I'm using
my honest Asya concealer and I'm going
to cover my under eyes and also use this
as a highlighter
to make sure my face makeup doesn't
slide right off I'm using the mineral
veil from bareMinerals to hold it all
together
to quickly shape up my brows I'm using
the M by Michelle Phan arched brow liner
and I've been using this pretty much
every day this week it's just so easy
and quick without really trying it gives
you a natural-looking nicely shaped brow
now to make sure that there aren't any
stray brow hairs sticking up in
unnecessary places I'm going to keep
them in line with my honest hacia clear
brow gel to make sure that our eye
shadow lives a long lifespan on our lids
today I'm using the HD NYX shadow base
I'm using the city color contour effects
palette for my eyes and my face and the
first color I'm picking up is this
bronze color and I'm going to wash this
all over my crease this palette is
really just a one-man one-woman show she
basically gets everything done
contouring eyes and it looks like you've
probably used several palettes when you
only use one found taking the highlight
color and placing this on my lids once I
had it all on there I realized that this
is way too light so I took my NYX jumbo
pencil and sparkling nude to neutralize
the lids
and add some shimmer now I'm going to
sweep that contour color into the crease
to create depth
here I'm just taking a clean brush to
blend out the edges so that they're nice
in soft
going back into the bronze color I'm
going to place this on the lower lash
line and then with a smaller defining
brush I'm going to pick up the contour
color and place it right on the outer
part of the lower lash line and then for
the inner corner highlight you guessed
it I'm going to use the highlight after
that's done and taking a clean brush to
blend out the edges and I'm also going
to use this color to highlight my brow
bone and I'm just putting a tiny bit
where I want it and then blending it out
with a clean fluffy brush
and per usual I am going to line my
upper lash line into a nice swing
it's lash curling time because we are
about to apply our mascara and today I'm
using the lash domination from
bareMinerals and I'm just applying a
generous coats
now we're going to define our face I'm
using the contour color and I'm just
sweeping this back and forth where the
hollow areas are and around the temples
now I'm going to highlight the high
points of my face that's the tops of my
cheekbones down the bridge of my nose
and the middle of the brows I want to
add some warmth to my face so I'm taking
the bronze color and placing this on to
my cheekbones for the blush I'm using
the bare minerals in the color cheerful
and focusing this right behind the
apples of the cheeks Here I am using my
cute cute chapstick again from a tude
house and cherry and after my lips are
hydrated I'm taking my lorac lipstick in
the color girl next door it's just a
really pretty pink and I'm applying that
to my lips and if you guys want some
sparkle to your lips I'm adding this lip
gloss from forever 21 to the center
and if you like the look thing or ah
okay all right
