come ass
hey guys so today we're at the beach and
I'm starting this tutorial off using
sunscreen that is waterproof so our skin
will stay safe next I'll be taking
Maybelline's bad to the bronze color
tattoo and applying it all over my upper
lid and lower half of my lower lash line
I'll be using my fingers if that's okay
with you guys
they're clean so it'll do this cream
shadow is especially great for the beach
because it is waterproof so that's a
great plus then I'm going to take my EOS
super hydrating SPF lip balm and apply
it all over my lips using zodiacs from
Urban Decay's moondust line I'm going to
dust this everywhere I set the cream
shadow which is the upper lid and half
of the lower lash line this really
reminds me of what a Slavoj Beauty
Victoria's Secret photoshoot tighter
than makeup it's really pretty and it
may be a little bit too much for some of
you guys but if you like to look extra
fancy on the beach then this is for you
then I'm going to take a waterproof
eyeliner for Urban Decay and align my
row roots my upper lash line and I'm
going to want line my lower lash line
halfway some of you can definitely skip
that step but you know I just like to go
all out and I'm gonna put a little bit
more of the zodiac on the outer corners
of my eyes for a dewy flushed kind of
look I'm gonna take tarts cheat stained
and tipsy and just Pat it onto my cheeks
for the lips I'm using Juice Beauty and
pink gloss and it's made with sesame
seed oil to shield and antioxidants to
nourish your lips with a high shine for
the hair I'm taking a new nice finishing
serum and applying it all over my hair
because these waves are super hot but
dry brittle hair is definitely not so
we're gonna nourish and protect our hair
with this finishing serum by applying
this new me.sir onto your hair you're
Harrison looks shinier and healthier it
looks a lot better then we're going to
go ahead and take joy at nail polish and
this is Jack and I'm just gonna paint my
nails and I'm not the best at painting
my nails I'm gonna admit that but I'm
definitely working on it or any of you
guys like as bad as me
or working on the nail thing I'm so into
nail polish now but I'm just not that
great anyways I'm taking Pacifica
coconut crushed pearl bronzing butter
and I'm going to apply that all over my
body and actually have a photon on and
it evened out that photon so I love this
stuff then I'm going to take a fragrance
not a perfume and spray it all over
because I think fragrances are light and
refreshing so this is the final look and
it's don't think it was too bad when you
think before I leave you I have a
