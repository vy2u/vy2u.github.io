show you a look inspired by the beach
since I'm pretty pale and I know I'm
gonna be showing my legs I always tan
the night before
here I'm using the Vita libera at
phenomenal tan which came in my Ipsy bag
this month and I really like it because
it's truly odorless and it gives you a
natural healthy tan after my tan is
dried I take my Pacifica coconut nectar
lotion to moisturize my skin to even out
my skin and help prevent any new
blemishes and using the Missha BB cream
to cover my dark circles I'm using my
Maybelline age rewind dark circle eraser
to highlight and add a bit more coverage
and taking my Maybelline fit me
concealer in sand and I'm applying that
just below my under under eye circles
and down the bridge of my nose and on my
chin starting with the crease color I'm
taking a plum shadow from my NYX wicked
June's palette and just washing it into
the crease
you
for the inner third and inner corners
I'm taking my Elizabeth Mott smooth
shadow in Pearl and applying it there as
a base I wanted to play around with the
different eye shapes so I took the dark
brown it is a matte dark brown any plum
work it into the inner crease along side
of the nose to create a deep set eye
with my next Amazonian babes palette I'm
taking the lightest color and applying
that just onto the Pearl base on the
inner corners and the inner they're easy
to highlight and picking up a matte bone
color from the palette and applying it
to the brow bone as always blend the
color down into the other colors so you
get a soft transition I'm adding a blue
winged liner using my chela liner pen in
indigo blue to add even more depth to
the crease I'm picking up the matte
brown color and applying it with a
precision brush going directly into the
crease and then gently blending it in
with a fluffy brush
they make my eyes appear larger and
taking the two dark shadows from the
palette and creating a line that goes
below the waterline in a diagonal toward
the nose leaving your eye looking bigger
and elongated to separate and lengthen
my lashes I'm using the Tarte lights
camera flashes mascara add a luminous
glow I'm taking benefits high-beam and
blending that into my skin add a natural
flush of color to my cheeks and taking
the NYX blush and pitch
make my lips if you're more defined and
going to line them with a the fire
since our eyes have so much color and
taking a nude lipstick and applying that
to my lips taking the next glam gloss
aqua luxe in the color VIP and just
applying that to the top of my lipstick
and this is the final look I hope you
enjoyed this video as much as I enjoyed
making it for you guys and before we go
I do have a request if you guys can just

to do an about me video or I get to know
