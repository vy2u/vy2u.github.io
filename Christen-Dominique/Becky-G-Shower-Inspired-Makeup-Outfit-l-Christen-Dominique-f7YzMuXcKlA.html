and I will be of course hi
hey guys welcome back to another
celebrity inspired look today I'm doing
Becky G from her shower video and it was
requested in my last celebrity look
which was the ariana grande and so I
decided to do it for you guys I think
she is super cute and so I created her
urban fun very youthful look so I hope
you guys enjoy the video I've been
coloring my hair a lot and to help me
with that I'm using the Rio Gio
don't despair repair deep conditioning
mask and it just leaves your hair really
soft afterwards and it helps with any
damage and breaking like I have in my
hair
and now that I'm out of the shower I
like to use a moisturizer and today I'm
using Beauty Without Cruelty it's a
sweet lavender hand and body lotion I'm
going to use that all over my body today
alright so I'm going to first start off
with my favorite primer it's the bare
minerals prime time it gives you a
little bit of coverage and smooths out
your skin
fills in your pores so I really love
this stuff
for foundation I'm going to use my cover
effects in g---forty it's the natural
finish oil-free foundation and I'm going
to apply it with a what kind of brush is
this the zoeva 102 is silk finish brush
if you've been watching my videos for a
while you know if that I've been using
this cover FX foundation I like the way
it just covers everything and then it's
it feels really lightweight so it
doesn't feel like you have a thick
foundation or thick layer of makeup on
or concealer I'm using the Revlon
Photoready in light pale and just get
apply this to my under-eye circles
i'ma blend it upwards towards the
cheekbones through the top of the
cheekbone so that it acts as a highlight
as well
so I'm going to also use this concealer
as a highlighter center of my brows and
forehead
and then right here on the Cupid's bow
I'm going to give us a natural
brightening effect for the brows I'm
going to take my honesty Beauty Express
palette just using the darkest brow
powder in the palette to fill in the
gaps and then I'm going to comb through
them with a spoolie end of my brow brush
and to make sure that everything is even
on my brows I go back with a with a
cargo brow pomade and it's in the color
dark and I just fill in the areas that
are still pretty sparse and so once I do
this it makes them look pretty nice and
even
to set my makeup and also help soften
any areas I still need help with I'm
going to take the be a bombshell HD
powder and apply this with my bare
minerals full flawless base brush
today I'm going to start out with the
crease and i'm using the vincent longo
luna beach shadow I'm just going to take
the taupe color at the top and wash that
onto my crease
for the lid I'm using the NYX hot
singles eyeshadow in the color dress to
kill which gives the eyes a nice pearly
look just like Becky G had in her video
I shot a look in the video is pretty
shimmery it does have a natural and
fresh look to it
I'm just going to go back into that
taupe color from the vincent longo
shadow and deepen the crease area to add
some depth to the eyes and I'm going
over with a pencil brush and then with
my Urban Decay Naked 2 palette I'm using
the color foxy and I'm going to apply
that to the brow bone and this is a
matte color so we do have a lot of
shimmer ease going on and then for the
inner corners I'm taking half baked
which is that gold color and I'm placing
it right in the inner corners next I'm
taking the Jessie's Girl liquid eyeliner
to give me a small wing like becky has
in the video
next I'm going to curl the lashes so
that we can apply some mascara and today
I'm using the Urban Decay perversion
mascara and just going to apply generous
coats to the top and bottom lashes
I was feeling a little shadowy under my
eyes so I took my Revlon concealer and
went back over them and then I used it
as a highlight once again to down the
bridge of my nose in the center of my
forehead and I know you probably aren't
supposed to use a powder with on top of
a concealer or concealer on top of a
powder but it works and I felt a whole
lot better afterwards
and after that I applied my honest Asya
banana and pink powder over my concealer
and oh I felt so much better after that
I felt a lot brighter and everything
looked a lot better after that and then
I'm taking my contour color to contour
my face that just goes on the hollows of
the cheeks around the temples around the
forehead down alongside the nose and
under the chin for the highlight today
I'm using the bellapierre illuminating
bronzer and peony and I'm applying this
with my zoeva highlighter brush to the
tops of my cheekbones and on the end of
my nose and to give my face a nice warm
glow I'm using the NYX Sunkist palette
and I'm going to apply that behind the
apples of my cheeks
to hydrate my lips I'm using the Bell
appear pink cheek pink cheek and lip
stain and it's a stain but it's actually
pretty hydrating and then I'm going to
take my Hikari cabernet lipstick and
this stuff flies on really smooth and it
dries matte or if the finish is matte so
it's really nice lip color and it's
perfect for the Becky G look and for my
nails I'm using the Sally Hansen
Americal gel and it's really cool
because I usually get gels done in the
salon but now I get to do them at my
house I used pretty piggy don't need any
lights for this that's why it's awesome
today I'm going to use the rap artists
nail decals and I'm gonna go ahead and
apply them for you guys I have my water
and the decals I'm just going to cut
some that I want to use so now I'm just
going to take the decal and dip it into
the water leave it in there for about 20
seconds and then I'm gonna place it on
my pointer finger and you have this
really cute detail it's super quick and
easy and I definitely think becky g
would try something like this what do
you guys think would you guys try this
and for today's fragrance I'm using
Harvey prints hello fragrance and it has
a lemon lemony scent to it so it reminds
me of summer so that's always nice to
remember the summer but in my heart I am
a fall girl and this scent actually
lasts pretty much all day
I'm at it I'm just gonna up and what am
I doing here and putting it on this I
don't know I'm going blank so wit and um
