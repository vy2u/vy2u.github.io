be drunk so it's gonna be like full-on
cake are you guys ready hey guys welcome
back to my channel so today I am gonna
be talking about something I am very
passionate about that is my full
coverage foundation I've said it so many
times on this channel I am a full
coverage girl full coverage I love the
cake I love just to look like I have
perfect looking skin because I really
really don't so I've always really loved
full coverage foundations from the time
I picked up a foundation I was like what
is this I need more coverage so I've
always loved that I've used so many
foundations that are full coverage and
I've searched all of my life time that
I've been wearing makeup in this world
searching for the best full coverage
foundations and I have brought them here
for you I asked you guys on Twitter I
put up a poll which one you want to see
drugstore or a high-end and you guys
basically said we want both so I have
that for you in this video so if you
want to see what the best of the best is
keep watching but before we get into the
video don't forget to subscribe to my
channel and hit that notification bells
to give you part of the quoi
family and without further ado we're
gonna get in to the video first
foundation I'm gonna talk about is jus a
essential high coverage foundation so
this retails for $38 and you can get it
on jus wacom the one that I'm wearing
right now and it's currently my favorite
very new it's very very new I literally
just tried it like a few days ago I
became obsessed immediately I actually
used it for the first time in my last
video so if you want to see that
reaction to this foundation I took it on
a shoot with me that I did and in blown
out lights looked beautiful on camera it
lasted a full eight hours did not budge
I've actually had this foundation on for
a full 10 plus hours it looks great I
did touch up under the eyes and I did a
little bit of bronzing my skin looks so
so good with this foundation I just I
love it so much it is like my new Estee
Lauder Double Wear feel like cream is
the best way to describe the way this
looks on your skin in the way it feels
on your skin it is like butter on toast
you don't need to
this thing on and I layer the most
fullest full coverage foundations out
there that I've tried I still layer them
on this one I don't layer on like that
because literally with one pounds of
your Beautyblender you can see it in my
last video it will make things disappear
it's like magic I can't talk it up
enough I just I love it it dries in
matte it covers all the blemishes fills
in all of the large pores and if you
have oily skin this thing is going to
work dreams for you comes in a pump
pumps are amazing anybody who makes the
foundation please make it into a pump
you can really control how much comes
out this is just a tiny bit but if you
work it over like I have really bright
green veins all over my body but if I
just work it over my hand
instantly it covers my vein like a
tattoo I mean I can keep going I'm
blending this out if blends out like a
dream and it just feels so light on the
skin it's not drying it's not
uncomfortable I don't see it oxidizing
much but it's literally covering up my
veins and making my skin look so
airbrushed and flawless jouer has given
me my own code which I've had for a long
time but since I'm talking about this
foundation so much I decided to let you
guys know if you want to use it it's
down there somewhere and if you're
thinking about buying the foundation
it's going to give you a nice gist the
next foundation I'm gonna talk about was
something I found when I first found my
first full coverage foundation and I
fell in love and still to this day I
swear by it foundation that I'm talking
about is the Revlon Colorstay foundation
by the way this foundation right here is
$12.99 this'll last for 24 hours and I
honestly haven't worn it as much to
really remember if it did last 24 hours
back in those days I did not wear primer
on my face at all so I just put on
foundation on my dry skin I would try
all these different foundations from the
drugstore and I would always find myself
going back to this one one annoying
thing about this foundation is that it
dries so freakin quick and if you use
too much it can
really cakey and crazy and it smells
kind of weird it smells like chemicals
but it goes away and the good thing
about this is if you're working out or
if you're doing something where you're
gonna be sweating or if there's a lot of
humidity in your city or whatever it is
your makeup is not gonna budge this does
not move and it's actually a little bit
hard to take off of your face like
you're gonna need like five Neutrogena
wipes really hard to remove but it does
the job and I love it this foundation
will cover everything up I promise you
and it's going to last you a very long
time has a SPF of 15 it does not oxidize
and that's one really great plus about
this because whatever comes out onto
your skin whatever you blend out onto
your skin that is the true color that it
will stay which is awesome and very hard
to find so I'm gonna try it on my hand
right now let's see if we can cover up
this these green veins right here put a
little bit on my hand and as you can see
it definitely covers the veins you have
to work really fast with this foundation
because it dries super quick you cannot
move it once it dries so you literally
gotta go in there and just beat your
face with a Beauty Blender within like
10 seconds or less because this is how
it's gonna stay that's the only bad
thing about it but I mean if you can
work fast and I remember it took me a
few times but I love the coverage so
much I learned how to use this
foundation and I used it till its
fullest coverage because it says it's
supposed to be a medium to full so I'm
gonna put on another layer with the
other foundation you just need one layer
but this one you can actually do two for
a maximum coverage it may enhance fine
lines and wrinkles it's a little bit
drying so you're gonna want to use a
hydrating primer and right now my
favorite primer that's super hydrating
and really makes your foundation just
glide on so beautifully is the Laura
Mercier hydrating primer it goes onto
your skin it's so nice you can just feel
your skin soaking up the moisture but my
skin just feels so much better so much
plump like I drink eight glasses of
water it prevents all these full
coverage foundations from making your
face feel like cracky
but this foundation has basically dried
now and as you can see it dry - very
fast it will not blend out at all so you
have to really work fast with this but
if you want a full coverage of drugstore
that's gonna be one of the ones you're
gonna sew the next foundation I'm gonna
get into is my all-time favorite
foundation this goes for $42 it's the
Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation oh
my gosh this foundation is so good it is
worth the money if you're looking for a
freaking full coverage foundation
because I want to tell you the good with
the bad so you know what to expect when
you're buying the foundation it almost
reminds me of the Revlon foundation
without it drying super fast this one
gives you some time to work it in it
doesn't ever really dry to the point
where you can't move it but the only
thing about this one is that it leaves
your skin feeling super dry like tight
like it's gonna crack open that kind of
dry at least that's what it does to my
skin my skin is dry to combo so I do
have to use a very hydrating primer or a
long-lasting intense moisturizer on my
face before I put this on because it is
extreme it is intense but it works
really well also another option for you
because this just does look really
freakin drawing on the face I get the
cover effects hydrating drops or any
kind of serum to mix in with this to
make it a little bit more thin and just
go on a little bit more smooth would
work well if you have oily skin this is
perfect for you you probably don't even
need a primer because it's gonna do the
job for you in every aspect it does last
a full day and now I have not it says
it's supposed to last for 24 hours I
have not tried this foundation for 24
hours because I usually take my makeup
off before I go to bed I can't really
tell you if it really lasts 24 hours but
I can tell you it lasts through the
morning tonight so that's a really long
time my skin ends up feeling a little
bit like Grandma sorry grandma you're
here no offense but hey she's actually
in the other room but it does feel very
like tight and it does get into your
pores to where you can see the fine
lines which is not the best but it is
going to cover up all the
wishes and make you look like a
porcelain doll like so let me just put
it on my my hand and I actually have a
scar I have my finger from when I fell
in Fiji so I'll show you how it covers
that as well it does a really good job
at full coverage if you have a scar on
your face it's going to cover it up this
is just one little swipe and it's
basically gone so this is a very very
good full coverage foundation depending
on your skin type you might have to
change your primer but overall this is a
very good foundation and I highly
recommend go for the next best full
coverage drugstore foundation out there
it is going to be l'oreal infallible Pro
matte this is also a 24 hour foundation
and it has a demi matte finish meaning
that it isn't completely dry matte which
actually works really well for my kind
of skin because I don't really like to
look like I'm super matte because I'm
already really dry so I always like to
put a little bit extra highlight in
places or or do a mist at the end of my
makeup so that it looks like skin again
so I like the fact that this doesn't dry
completely matte this foundation is
$12.99 as well same price as Revlon if I
were comparing the two I would just get
this one so I'm gonna just put it on my
hand give it the test I'm gonna work
that into my skin as you can tell this
is another extreme coverage I feel like
it's very comparable to the Estee Lauder
Double Wear if not a dupe to the Estee
Lauder Double Wear so you can go light
and still get a lot of coverage or you
can go a little bit heavier and get
maximum full coverage it doesn't feel
drying on the skin and it doesn't feel
like it's heavy so it's not weighing it
down so that's one layer I'm gonna do a
second layer and honestly I feel like I
don't need a second layer but I want my
green veins to completely disappear and
I'm gonna try that on my red scar to
make sure that
it covers it so again if you have
scarring on your face this is obviously
not the right color but if you have
scarring on your face it's going to
cover it up and imagine just a second
layer of this completely gone it's not
heavy
not drying not completely matte but it
does have that effect on your skin and
you want to cover up deep dark circles
redness blemishes zits this is gonna do
it for you I highly recommend this
drugstore option highly it's a good one
so for the next high-end foundation I'm
going to be talking about the Urban
Decay all nighter foundation and this is
a waterproof the long wear foundation
I said foundation like 30 times drink
every time I say foundation you'll be
drawing so be careful
but this foundation is really good it's
super full coverage I like the coverage
it lasts but it does oxidize so be
careful with this one really test it out
before you buy it test out the entire
range if you can if they let you
wherever you're buying it at if you're
worried about your fine lines if you're
worried about large pores then
definitely get this Smashbox photo
finish primer something that has
silicone in it that's going to sit into
your pores and make it look like a
smooth even surface or something that's
more hydrating if you don't have that
issue but you don't want it to feel dry
on your face because this one will feel
that way it's very long wearing this
foundation is $40 in case you guys are
wondering we go ahead and put it on my
hand so here's my hand before it's a
very thick foundation and that is
intense
that is actually more intense than a lot
of these foundations so if you're really
looking for that full coverage this is
definitely like an event kind of makeup
picture day makeup again you want to
test it out before you buy it because it
does oxidize a ton so it gets so much
darker than this for the last full
coverage foundation from the drugstore
that we're gonna be talking about is
Milani the Milani conceal imperfect two
in one foundation plus couldn't see
this is another crazy crazy foundation a
very similar to the Urban Decay all
nighter because it is that intense and I
was
I forgot how intense that was like I
know it was full coverage but this is
just like I don't stay this work very
often but it literally had me shook to
the core it has a pump which is amazing
I love that it has a pump so easy to
apply so it's not less messy it is a
little bit thicker and we're gonna just
start to work that into our to our hands
right away it is very similar in
coverage to the Urban Decay all nighter
this is the most affordable foundation
that I am talking about in this video
it's $9.99 and it looks like the Urban
Decay all nighter literally looks like a
forty dollar foundation this one is
extremely full coverage this is only one
application if you let it die down it
does oxidize a little bit so you got to
watch out for that as well but play
around actually I don't know if you can
play around with drugstore foundations
they don't just let you try them um but
try to see what your color is if you're
getting married and you're on a budget
and you have like scars or something
that you really need to cover up or you
just love full-coverage flawless skin
get this foundation this foundation is
beautiful but make sure you get your
color and it does not oxidize on you on
your wedding day but it is extremely
full coverage and I wish I knew about
this back when I was in high school
because I would have been buying this
and saving so much more money that's
pretty much it those are all the
foundations that I have for you guys
today these are my favorite ultimate
full coverage foundation most of these I
wouldn't use every day besides the jouer
and the infallible Pro matte I would
actually use this every day and I
wouldn't mind it but the other ones I
would say definitely save them for an
event a big event like a wedding or
picture day or anything like that
because it is gonna make you look so
flawless but most of them are gonna feel
really heavy on your skin
and it's not gonna be comfortable for an
entire day unless you're trying to look
like Beyonce the entire day then you do
you watching I hope you enjoyed this
video and if you like this type of video
this is the first time I'm doing this
type of video let me know in the
comments maybe I could do more maybe
it's the best concealers because that is
another passion of mine covering these
dark under-eye circles let me know in
the comments what you want to see and
that's it that's the end of this video
before I let you go I want you guys to
start believing in yourself today if you
don't believe in yourself or if you're
having any doubt just start doing it
today you can do it I love you and I
wish you the best of luck until the next
