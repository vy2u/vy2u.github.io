welcome back to my channel so today I'm
going to be doing this quick glam makeup
look it's perfect for a big event or a
night out it's really simple it's kind
of my go-to so I hope you guys enjoy it
and if you want to learn how to get it
then keep watching to hydrate my skin
I'm going to use the lather the ultra
light face lotion it's non greasy so you
can use this everyday I'm going to try
this out
to hydrate my face today and has a very
lightweight texture and doesn't leave
any oily film over your skin next I'm
going to pry my face primer I'm using is
from Too Faced it's the hangover RX this
is just going to help your makeup apply
evenly and last longer throughout the
day to hydrate my lips I'm going to use
the olive lips oats and honey lip balm
this is going to protect your lips and
allow them to breathe so I'm gonna just
apply that really quick I'm going to use
the least wadi a base correcting
luminous primer and this is in banana
and I'm just going to put this in the
areas I'd like to highlight so just use
this as a base highlight also if you
have any redness in that area it's going
to help conceal it for foundation I'm
going to go full coverage since this is
a big event I'm going to do the
Amazonian clay full coverage foundation
from Tarte and this is in the color
medium sand so I'm going to use my
Beauty Blender to apply it
next I'm taking my makeup forever full
cover concealer and I'm going to dot it
right underneath my eyes to cover up my
under-eye circles so now I'm going to
pick up my honest Asya perfect brow
pencil this is in the color ash brown
and I'm just going to fill in the sparse
areas and elongate the tail end of my
brow because I really don't have a tail
to the end of my brow so thanks to
makeup I can do that and now it just
looks nice and polished set my
foundation I'm going to use my Urban
Decay a medium neutral powder foundation
something that's going to have a lot of
coverage in it so I'm just going to dust
this over my foundation to set it in and
then also add an extra layer of coverage
this is definitely a heavier foundation
routine and it's really good for like a
big night out or a big event or if
you're going to be out all night so that
your makeup stays put and if you're
going to be taking a lot of pictures
your skin is going to look really nice
for my under eyes I'm going to use the
Manica dark powder and c3 I use this one
a lot you guys know so I'm just going to
dust it over my under eyes okay for my
lids I'm going to take my Tarte lip
palette and I'm using free spirit right
there I'm just going to dust it on all
over my lid if you don't have a color
like this you can use your powder your
face powder you just want to neutralize
everything on your lid it's going to
help with the eyeshadow sliding and
moving around so it all goes on very
even I'm so I'm so serious today and
then for the lid I have these cute
little eye shadows from the balm they
came to me it's C glam bag this month
there are these little nude dip or
single shadows the first one I'm going
to use is fit which is this guy right
here literally this guy and I'm going to
put this all over my lid and I'm gonna
Pat it or press it into my
lid when you use a patting motion or
pressing you get more color payoff that
way rather than kind
sweeping it next I'm going to take
flirty and I'm going to place it right
underneath my lower lashes to create
depth there and these eye shadows can be
worn wet or dry you can layer it or wear
it alone it has a high color payoff so
it works really well on its own as well
I'm gonna take force of nature which is
this really light medium brown color and
I'm just going to sweep it along my
crease this is going to be the base
crease color this color is going to peek
through the darker color we're going to
put over it so now I'm going to take
dreamer which is a darker shade of brown
and I'm going to focus this right on the
outside of the lid so that it looks more
elongated in sultry and then once I do
that I'm going to take a clean fluffy
brush actually this one has a bit of
eyeshadow on it but it's a lighter color
so it's all good and then I'm going to
soften the edges so that it looks nice
and blended and then I went ahead and
took the darker color dreamer and I
placed it right underneath the lash line
as well to give your eyes more depth now
I'm going to take the Make Up For Ever
ink liner to create an intense cat eye
and if you mess up on this cat eye go
ahead and take a concealer brush and fix
it with concealer honestly that's what I
did I just cut out all the parts that
took me to get to this point so now I'm
just gonna take my roller lash mascara
from benefit this is my favorite mascara
from benefit they're they're real
mascara spikes were a little bit too
spiky for me and I'd always end up
poking my eye and it would water these
are really soft and flexible so I really
like them the lashes I'm wearing today
are the ikonics from house of lashes I'm
excited to try them and I like how
they're PC so you can see your eye
shadow through the lashes I heard
they're really easy to to wear all day
because they're not very heavy and
they're just really comfortable so
really excited
so I'm going to do some contouring I'm
going to use the Kat Von D shade light
contour palette and it looks like this
inside it's pretty nice and I'm going to
pick up this middle color here to hollow
out the areas of my face
for my blush I'm going to use look at
this box it's so cute it's from
Pandora's blush is that nope Pandora's
makeup box and this is a Pandora blush
and it's suitable for all skin types so
anyone can use it just going to put a
little bit of this on just to add a tiny
bit of color when you're doing a red lip
you don't want to use too much color in
your cheeks so going with a bronze works
so I'm just going to put a little bit of
this on the tops of my cheekbones so
when you're wearing a bold lip you want
to make sure you keep your blush behind
the apples of your cheeks so that it
looks more natural so next I'm going to
take my highlighter from a Becca this is
in moonstone and I'm just going to apply
it right on the tops of my cheekbones
and above my brow just where the light
naturally hits and then take a separate
brush with that's less dense and just
blend out the edges so it looks nice and
blended and to line my lips I'm using
the colour-pop lippie pencil and this is
in the color julep it's just a red matte
red color
next I'm going to take the Elizabeth
Arden a beautiful color moisturizing
lipstick in the color red door red it is
very moisturizing and it's pretty long
wearing it lasts me pretty much the
whole night so that's a good thing
next I'm taking the theory argan oil
ultimate reform hair serum this is going
to help restore moisture back into my
hair and then I put in my extensions
these are from foxy locks and they're in
the color Sunkist Brown I have two West
clipped together and then I clip them
into my hair just to add some fullness
and brighten my hair color up a bit and
then I just put it down and brush it
through and I just straighten my hair
today so there you go and this is the
final look I hope you guys enjoyed the
