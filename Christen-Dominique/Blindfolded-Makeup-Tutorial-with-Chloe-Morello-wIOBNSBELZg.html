everywhere in your house this must be
the Clinique on but where's that primer
that you have oh I know I'm going to
just survey the area with a flat arm I
don't even know what this is primer but
I haven't seen this one before this you
think it's primer what do you know what
you didn't give me brushes oh my god
this is the blindfolded no brushes

this is because I saw it okay this is
the clinic two-in-one

flatter motion flitter flat up I'm going
to put the
um lashes on now so left eye first okay
personally are you allergic to latex no

so much because it lies are strong all
right I can't I don't know how long this
thing is what that is what did not glue

Oh see this guys that is how you that is
it that's how you put on the lash glue

heart okay oh that's what I'm talking
about let's get some Big Daddy powder on

Big Daddy get a lot on there because we
like full coverage in this household
don't freak me out good you're good is
this very like strong this stuff oh yeah
it is so I shouldn't put this much on
whatever you feel go with your gut
feeling oh just a tribal and I felt very
wet mm-hmm
love it okay now I'm on the feel out for
um the brow pencil from benefit which is
that weird shade yes
maybe my finger is a stencil I need a
lot of brow so help me out okay
you're a girlfriend a cookie I'm just
coloring in like in primary school
primary schools like kindergarten or
like elementary elementary elementary my
dear Watson yet my dear Watson is that
it I can just feel your aura and it's
already way more attractive than before
yeah way more so I'm going to get some
of this now trusting Mac it'll probably
be a bit pigmented so you just grab the
face of your client and just start up
the top so you deposit the most pigment
there and then bring it down just use
your fingers as the guide so you don't
put too much on you I mean
in case you're blindfolded I did this
thing in Germany and it was like a place
where you could see what it was like to
be actually blind for a day was the most
I was about to say eye-opening thing but
it was really amazing to Lee so yes and
your guide is a blind person mm-hmm and
you can like go to a restaurant go to
the shops and experience what it's like
to be blind it was really no way yeah
how was it it was really hard so I think
this is a blush yeah no it had two
colors when one of them was darker than
the other I think I got the dog which is
what we want more drama drama because
we're not doing a Picasso look today not
at all okay so this yeah what's that my
chin okay
not yet I want to get that black one
okay this feels really big it is really
that it's a really big lipstick what is
that you know the way you're touching it
like she's slightly up
what the hell what do you think it is
and you're gonna know what it is what is
this Oh
skaara oh yeah my scar when I heard the
little oh I found it I don't know what
color this is
there was three colors I really hope
it's black is it black is your mouth
closed
mmm oh yeah looks like I say we made
jelly bean or maybe you shouldn't dress
this what are you doing what are you
doing where's you miss your ring what
the hell is going on this is like the
matrix mm okay this is no nothing thank
you
I'm getting my Joker what I do this is
highlighter right yeah yeah that's
highlighted some say some may call it
highlight
Wow
she's really excited obviously put it in
the product not the lid
I was just flicking the excess of the
brush are you ready yeah
- see ya know every button I do enough
yeah
yes like Joker Picasso on one night we
were you touching my eyeball it was this
yeah I love it would highlight a little
bit it's gonna hurt your eye oh it's not
yeah look at that get up close look
where I put that and that
okay the eyeshadow is good but the
eyeliner eyeshadow is good everything
else was very abstract okay isn't that
what it's about like you know you wasn't
colored still like it I think that it
used to look pretty for sure oh yeah
Chloe I did get makeup on my huh you did
it just a little bit a lot of base of
Chloe's artwork in a gallery somewhere
okay so this was Chloe's artwork right
here what do you guys think I'm not
proud I think I could have done better
if you had let me use my organized
makeup space no instead I went to make
it rod I would have looked way too
pretty what is this highlighter dammit
that's what I was looking for I didn't
recognize it I think you added it kind
of late in the game I did that's
beautiful it is really pretty too
beautiful to use on this we have ride
