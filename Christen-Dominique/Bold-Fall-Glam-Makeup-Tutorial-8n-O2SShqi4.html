have you had your PSL yet hey guys
welcome back to my channel so today I am
doing this bold glam fall look for you
guys I see a lot of fall lips which are
dark plums but I haven't seen a red yet
usually we save that for winter I am
going to use something that's going to
give your lips a shine and a bold color
without it being super plummy
matte honestly I'm gonna be doing that
look very soon but because I have a
whole lot of fall looks that I want to
do this is just one of them and I got
solutely love it the eyes are completely
matte I left the shine to the lips trust
me you're gonna want to wear this
everywhere I didn't realize how good
this looks
I didn't realize how good this was gonna
turn out until I finished and I was like
yes girl this lip is so unique and I
love it so much I can't wait to show you
guys this is a new lippy from NARS it's
called a velvet lip glide and it is
literally unlike any other lippy out
there that I've tried and I'm gonna tell
you why I love it so much later in this
video keep watching and if you want to
learn how to get this look then keep
watching behind my face moisturize and
I'm gonna get straight into the
foundation I'm today I'm gonna be using
the NARS Velvet Matte skin tip season
light 3 I work it into my face with my
Ortiz brush my oval artiste brush I just
got back from New York this morning and
it feels so good to be home I get home
took really fast I feel really happy to
be here right now in my home filming a
video for you guys the next thing I'm
gonna do is concealer when I use my Kat
Von D concealer for underneath my eye
all the way to the temple so we can use
this as a highlight as well I was really
skeptical about these brushes when I
first got em I didn't feel like they
were going to work for me because look
at it it's a spoon basically but these
brushes are so good at blending your
foundation so I have been doing my brows
off-camera a whole lot lately and
somebody asked me are why don't you ever
do your brows on camera I have several
videos where I actually do them on
camera I'm not skipping this part just
for you I got you girl I'm going to use
the NYX sculpt in highlight brow contour
I'm gonna start off with filling in
sparse areas just usually around the
middle and the tail so to get this look
I am gonna go ahead and use this I feel
like I'm gonna be using this palette a
lot this is the morphe 35o M oMG is this
not like fall on your face this is fall
what we're going to do is first lay down
a shade that's similar to our skin tone
this is gonna be a really nice base for
us and go with this pinky shade right
here apply this to my entire lid and
what this does is this helps any
eyeshadow that goes over on top of it
it's gonna help it blend out a lot
easier help glide your brush right over
it and look very smooth and even all the
way up to the top of the brow bone so
I'm going to take this morphe M 518
brush right here and I'm going to take
one of these transition shades I'm going
to take this one right here and I'm
going to focus this on the outer part of
the crease right in here already giving
me that mustard goodness for this crease
shade right here I am using the lightest
pressure the more pressure that you push
onto your brush it's going to make your
eye shadow look a lot more harsh it's
not going to glide on as gradual so you
want to start off using a very light
hand so next I'm going to use this shade
right here and I'm going to work that on
to
the crease is going to add on to all of
our crease colors that we have going on
in our eyes right now we're going to
have a ton using a light upward motion
with my brush and work it into the
crease I'm going to take the same brush
and go into this darker shade right here
this looks like an expresso color to me
some and call it expressive I'm going to
deepen up the crease even more
with the lightest touch you can possibly
have hold your brush way at the back end
just softly just do circular motions
upwards and you are going to blend that
harsh shade out so easy so for the next
shade I'm going to go ahead and take
this one right here
and I'm going to pop it on to the inner
part of the eyelid I'm gonna go in with
my morphe M 5:07 brush I'm gonna take it
the darkest Brown that I have in the
palette I'm going to take this shade
right here and I'm going to intensify
the outer crease just a little bit more
I'm going to go in with this brow bone
color right here that we used all over
our lid earlier I'm just going to take
this dose of colors concealer brush that
works too and on point
I'm just going to go over the brow bone
I like highlighting the brow bone
because it makes the brow look a little
more cleaner and defined and it also
helps with bringing out the shadow and
kind of blending out those harsh lines
and just making it look really smooth
I'm going to pop it into my inner corner
I'm trying this new eyeliner for the
first time this is elf intense ink liner
very interesting just cut them I don't
know about you guys but when it comes to
the mascara I'm like this is the most
boring part of the tutorial because we
all know how to put mascara on and now
I'm going to go ahead and do the lower
part of the lash line I'm going to go
back into my morphe palette so I'm going
to take my pencil brush from dose of
colors and I'm gonna start off with that
that mustard each transition shade we
used earlier I'm just gonna work it on
the lower part of the lash line giving
us that mustard realness I'm just so
used to doing this I'm using my morphe
m12 creating a little baby fan brush and
I'm just blending out the edges and then
take the darkest shade and just run it a
closer to the lash line I'm gonna take
this Kiko eye pencil brush in oh one
find my waterline with it just to
brighten up the eyes a little bit
you guys remember whenever like doing
white eyeliner on your waterline was
like a thing and when you use like a
nude pencil it also kind of acts as a
concealer and conceals any redness that
you have makes it look a little bit more
healthier okay so now it is time for the
eyelashes I'm going to use these Lily
lashes in Kuwait most of the lash glue I
put on the ends of the lash because they
tend to lift up super easy
patient in a calm because if I'm frantic
doing my lashes they will not come out
right they will be lopsided trust me
your lashes feel fear my lashes feel it
and it's like don't rush me hey now it's
time to slay those cheekbones so I'm
going to go ahead and take my velvet 59
contour is a girl's best friend palette
this is a cream contour palette and I'm
going to take this brush right here this
is from a Kat Von D and I'm going to use
the lightest shade this ashy Brown I'm
gonna move it in upward motions Midway
like right there it doesn't need to go
past there and just keep blending it in
and now with the lighter shades I'm just
gonna highlight the nose bits bone I'm
going to use this NARS orgasm
illuminator we're going to put it on the
tops of our cheekbones just going take a
little bit just to give us that dewy
fall glow just because it's full of
doesn't mean you can't look glowing and
really pop out whatever we put on top
I'm going to lock everything in place
make sure it doesn't slide or slip off
so I'm going to take this morphe e41
huge powder brush right here and i'm
just going to use my bare minerals
golden nude powder bear pro performance
powder foundation why did I just do an
announcers voice bear pro performance
powder foundation golden nude
and then for bronzer I'm going to take
this Charlotte Tilbury film star bronze
&amp;amp; Glow and I take this bronzer right
here just to add some color to my face I
like this one because it's a very light
and natural looking it's not orange as
you can see it's not too ashy it's just
the perfect bronze color I'm going to
use this grow lactic face glow in
natural it's a highlight I'm going to
take this a touch of highlight on the
tops of my cheekbones that very
natural-looking
Cupid's bow the part I have been waiting
for this entire video because I am so
excited about these new lippies from
NARS so this right here is the NARS new
velvet lip glide it's so so pretty I
love the packaging the shades are
gorgeous so these are the shades this is
such a pretty range they all have really
cute names they're named after the 70s
era of the nightclub there's 13
different shades and I feel like any of
these lippies are going to look good on
so many different skin tones the one
that I'm going to be using today that
fits this look it's a red I haven't done
one of these shades in a long time and
it's called
lip Alice and I like the packaging it's
so modern and sleek it has a plushy
doe foot applicator so it's really
comfortable when you're putting it on
your lips
this is a unique lippy because it glides
on like a gloss but it gives you that
intense rich color of a lipstick it's
also very nourishing to the lips and
it's extremely comfortable very very
wearable for every day it doesn't feel
like you're wearing something thick and
heavy on your lips it just sits nice and
comfortable you won't even realize
you're wearing it throughout the day
this is really the first of its kind I
swear it goes on like a gloss but then
it has it's a semi matte high-impact
