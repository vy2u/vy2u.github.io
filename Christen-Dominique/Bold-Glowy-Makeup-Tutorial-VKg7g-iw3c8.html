new amazing things and share with you
guys how to get this look don't forget
to subscribe to my channel hit the
notification bell so you can be a part
of the quad family and without further
ado let's get on with the tutorial mmm
I'm going to try this primer this is
from Korres it's the Greek yogurt
smoothie primer so we're gonna go ahead
and use that today I've actually never
used this before so oh it smells really
good hmm actually kind of smells a
little perfume it definitely feels like
it's moisturizing my face it feels
cushiony on the skin which is awesome
for foundation today I'm going to use
this one from Olay crawl to the pro
coverage HD high definition long wearing
illuminating foundation it's such a long
name but I'm going to try this guy out
today this is in the shade natural so
I'm just going to take some of this on
my hand and just pounce it all over my
face oh this is actually this is a
perfect match for me so for the eyes
today I'm going to be using this palette
right here this is from this is the
narcissist loaded eyeshadow palette and
I
the packaging it's so pretty it is
actually limited edition has twelve
super velvety eyeshadows in it they're
so so pretty these eyeshadows are
everyday wearable eyeshadows that you
can use from day to night and then you
can deepen it up with these shadows over
here add some shimmery sparkly lid I've
used this and snapchat get ready with me
insta stories so you guys know I love
this palette all kinds of stuff you can
do with this palette highlight diffuse
define there's so much you can do with
it I'm gonna go on with Windsor right
here this is like a warm beige matte
color very pigmented eyeshadow I'm just
going to use that all over my lid load
it up and pack it pack it down load it
up and pack it down so that's basically
to make sure that it's going to glide on
smooth this is our base and now I'm
going to go in with a transition shade
the transition shade I'm going to be
using is this one right here it spelled
like that and it's a peach matte shade
so I'm going to take this peach matte
shade first and pop it into the crease
with this morphe brush does not have a
number on it but I think it fits in my
priest priest fits in my crease pretty
good so we're gonna use this one just
like so and I'm just going to use these
back and forth motions right here and
use circular motions towards the end of
my lid just because my skin is very taut
in that area so I can kind of move my
brush around easier so I'm just going to
go back and forth here very lightly
because my skin's a little bit more
loose in this inner corner area so just
remember we all have different eye
shapes we all have different lid spaces
it's really important to use transition
shades when you're doing like a bold eye
shadow look you always want to start off
with something that is very light and
neutral in that same shade range that
you're going in and then build on that
because if you start off with one strong
color it's going to be a lot harder to
blend and it's going to be a lot more
difficult to layer on you know so make
sure using the right eye shadow brush
and make sure you are transitioning your
eyeshadows so the next color I'm going
to pick up is this darker shade of brown
okay these shades are kind of difficult
for me to pronounce so I'm going to just
spell it out right here
it's an umber brown matte shade and pop
it into the crease as well and I'm just
going to use the same brush I'm just
going to layer right on top always want
to tap off the excess so you don't put
too much product down at one time is you
want to build it up so I'm going back
and forth here and I always keep in mind
that I want each shade that I use before
to peak through so I kind of try to keep
it below that shade or I'll go back and
I'll I'll add that shade back into the
crease so that it shows you know so you
don't want to overlap it completely so
you have that nice gradient and with
this I'm gonna work it down into the
outer V and I'm layering this on kind of
like I'm doing a wing I'm just going
from the outer lid and following up
towards the tail end of the brow and
what this also does is give you the
illusion of a more lifted eye so you can
tell but the difference in my eyes
already if this looks a little bit more
yeah like I got an eye lift or something
so in case you guys have a problem where
your eyes look tired or droopy try doing
your eyeshadow like this at an angle
okay the next shade I'm gonna use is
right here the dark brown matte shade so
I'm starting off with just a little bit
of the dark brown on the outer corner so
I'm like tapping it in there just using
circular motions keeping in mind you
want those other colors to peak through
the top and just start to intensify the
outer V and you gotta remember the
shadow is embedded in the brush so you
can still build on what you have here
until you've really you're not doing
much with it then you can add a little
bit more really take your time on this
because dark shadows are a little bit
more difficult to blend and work with so
a little bit at a time something that
you me and I have something coming out
on my skin
great uhm so I'm going to go back in
with a brush we used for the lighter
shades in the crease and I'm going to
soften up the outer edge of that before
it gets too crazy I'll always remember
if you have trouble blending make sure
your hand is towards the back of the
brush the next shade of minis in the
palette is the darkest shade in the
palette it's a Zee black satin shade
I'll have it written below with the same
brush it's pretty tiny with the same
brush I'm going to go ahead and dip into
that black shade and
to work that on the outer crease as well
on the outer V so I'm going to go in
with this really beautiful bronze shade
right here this is a bronze shimmer and
I'm going to pop that on to the lid and
then I'm just going to use that clean
blending brush and just make sure
there's no harsh edges and then for my
wing I'm going to use this girl acted
precise eyeliner marker looks like that
pretty sharp and pointy just how I like
it I'm going to go ahead and start to do
a very dramatic wing let's see how
dramatic it gets I like that this
eyeliner lets you do a very thin precise
line because that that point is so
narrow when you do this type of eyeliner
it really really gives you a facelift or
like that facelift look so now I'm just
going to prep my little lashes for false
lashes so I'm going to put some mascara
on actually I'm going to go back into
the black or the darker Brown and kind
of smoke out the wing a little bit
towards the end so I'm going to take
that dark brown and just smoke around
the wing like right in here
ok so now we're going to go into the
eyelashes we are going to use let's see
or whoo those look nice or the iconic
lights okay
I'm going to go with Lyla from house
from Lily lashes we're going to go back
to the lower part of the lash line in
just a little bit but I want to do the
rest of the face so I'm going to go in
with some concealer I'm going to use
this one from Le girl let's the pro
conceal I'm going to go ahead and work
this on my under eyes this concealer is
amazing covered up everything I know I'm
using a lot of la girl but I just got in
a ton of new la girl makeup and I wanted
to try it out so next mini is this Pro
contour cream from Le girl I'm going to
take that contour color start to contour
my nose just shave off the sides a
little bit okay so now that we have all
of the face on there I'm going to go
ahead and work on the lower lash line
but I'm going to go into the shade right
here and work that on the lower lash
line it's kind of like when you're
working with a crease you want to build
up the intensity that's kind of what
we're doing here take that with a
orpheum 5:07 brush and I'm just going to
work that on the lower lash line
and then I'm going to go in with this
little brush right here this is from the
makeup shock the brush number is t2 I'm
just going to work my brush into the
darkest brown shade I'm going to start
to pack that on the lower lash line
using these little padding motions and
then I'm going to go into the waterline
actually haven't even opened this yet
this is another Le girl pencil all the
girls pretty good very creamy you can go
all the way in I'm gonna stop just
before it goes too far just because my
eyes are a little more close together so
I like to keep all the darkness from
here back and then for the inner corners
I want to brighten it up so I'm going to
take this shade right here it's called
Newberry street white gold shimmer we're
going to use that
to really brighten up the inner corner
so my goal for this look is to be super
glowy to the point where you guys need
sunglasses to watch this video so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to start
off with this iconic London illuminator
I'm just taking a little dot and working
that on my cheek bone and to set
everything in place I'm going to be
using my the bomb highlight and contour
palette so I'm going to be taking these
two shades right here right on the under
eyes and I'm just patting everything in
place and then to set the contour in
place what I'm going to do is use the
contour shades in the balm highlighting
contour palette and just accentuate the
cheek contour and because this is the
powder it's going to help just set
whatever is underneath it in place so
you don't necessarily need to go all
over with one face powder so the next
thing we're going to use is bronzer so
I'm gonna use this Rimmel one it's
called natural bronzer it's a waterproof
bronzer really I'm just gonna work that
into my cheek anywhere else I'm just
taking this neutral color right here and
just setting it in place like right
below the cheekbone it also kind of
helps with enhancing that contour so I
am setting the highlight in place with a
powder highlight this one is from Oprah
it's called blissful it is so gorgeous
this is gorgeous I thought I loved Rodeo
Drive and then this happened and
actually I'm going to add a little bit
of blush I'm going to take this one from
Kylie it's the new Kylie blush it's
called x-rated I'm just gonna pop it
onto the cheekbone stick out a little
bit more glow and yes I am highlighting
my ears your ears can be cute for the
lip liner I'm going to be using this
color pop lippie pencil in Boystown and
I want my highlight mustache to show the
lips I'm gonna use this Oprah liquid lip
in nude potion and this is actually from
the Nicki tutorials collab is Purdy and
then I'm going to go over the center
with this galactic lippy in the
Shyne has like a gloss end like a clear
gloss and then it has this gorgeous
glittery and she's so pretty I want to
use this as a highlight on the center of
my lips so now your lips have that wet
glowy look
