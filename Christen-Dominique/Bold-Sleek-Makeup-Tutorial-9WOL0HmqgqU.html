guys know I'm not naked I know I look
naked but I promise I am wearing an
upside down tube dress because I don't
have a black tube top hey guys welcome
back to my channel today I'm gonna be
doing this plummy smokey halo eye with a
pop of lime on the lid I haven't done a
dramatic look in such a long time and
I'm using a bunch of new makeup that
I've been excited to try out so I can't
wait to show you guys how to get this
look in the new makeup also just to
remind you guys I am doing a huge
back-to-school giveaway on my last video
the back-to-school video I'm doing away
i pads a MacBook Air I don't want you
guys to miss out so don't forget to
enter if you haven't already and if you
have then good luck and if you want to
learn how to get this sleek smokey look
that I have been obsessed with don't
forget to subscribe to my channel and
hit that notification bells to give you
a part of the quad family and without
further ado let's get on I'm gonna have
a lot of smokey mess all over my face so
I don't want to start with any
foundation at all so what I'm gonna do
is just jump into the eyes so to prime
my eyes I'm gonna use this NARS soft
matte complete concealer this also
cleans up the brow and I keep moving
that over and I like a winged liner
because you want it to be nice and fluid
and then bring it down and you want the
base to be nice and even
we'll work that in with my finger using
your finger is best when you're applying
or blending out creamy products like
this because the warmth of your skin
heats up the product and it just melts
into your skin it's so nice and flawless
okay so we've primed our lids we have a
nice even base but I also want to make
sure that I set this cream because if I
just start applying different shades and
it's not set it might move around and
get really weird so you want to make
sure you set it I'm going to be using
the
nude beach palette from the balm today
for the smokey eye and I'm gonna take
brilliant I'm gonna take this shade
right here it's a very neutral similar
to my skin tone shade it's just gonna
set our eyes in place so nothing budges
our moves and just pop that on so that
nothing is moving around on our eyelids
so now we're done prepping our eyes I'm
gonna go straight into the crease the
crease shade that I'm using is actually
not in this palette because I didn't see
a light enough shade to really
transition into so I'm just taking Peach
Smoothie from makeup geek tap off the
excess and start right in the crease
right in your crease and if you don't
have a crease you can always make one
and you just want to make a Halfmoon
right above any part of your lid and
that will be your crease I'm gonna work
that back and forth in some windshield
wiper motions like so and you can see
it's very subtle but it's going to be
very helpful in the gradual process of
this dark intense shadow that we are
doing today so I'm gonna also do the
same thing to the other eye and I feel
like this eye is just the stepsister get
ready because we are about to use a ton
of different crease shades so are you
ready it's called bold it's in this bold
area right here I'm gonna take this same
brush and just work that shade right
into the same area so we're just going
overlapping that Peach Smoothie shade
and working it right into the crease and
when you want to buff out the shadows
make them look softer towards the edge
you always want to lift your hand up
take your hand move it towards the back
of the brush and then lift the pressure
up and use these circular motions to
blend them out I'm going to take bold on
this brush and just work it on the inner
and outer corners bring it up into the
crease where we were blending and then
you see how it's kind of harsh go ahead
and take whatever crease brush you were
using and with a very light soft feather
hand with your hand could be a feather
use the circular motions and it buffs
everything out and then I'm gonna go on
the inner corner
and start to work that in there and then
I'm going to connect this to the crease
and bring the crease shade down into the
inner part of the lid this is a very
light layer but I like to just go back
and forth just to make sure that I don't
have any harsh edges and since I've
already talked you through one eye I'm
just going to fast forward this part and
turn on my ratchet music and finish this
eye look
the next crease shade this is what
crease number three the next crease
shade is bodacious this orange brown
shade right here I'm gonna work that
right on the outer corners and into the
crease same thing we're just layering it
over we want the other shadows to peek
through these so you make some space so
that you can still see them okay for the
fourth shade that we're using it's this
one right here it's called brazen so
we're going to take that on the same
brush I was cleaning it off as I go so
don't worry it is the actual true color
that one the same area so I'm going to
take it right on the outer edge work it
here you want us to use this darker
shade very low and you don't want to
overdo this you want to gradually build
this up a little bit at a time because
once you put on way too much it is very
difficult to blend out take your time
and blend out as you go I really like
this brush for blending this is the
urban decay
itro 9 tapered blending because you're
wondering this is a really really nice
brush to blend and again I'm using a
very light hand in hand it's lifted off
of the skin very light pressure and then
I'm just going back and forth do not
press down too hard once I started doing
this my makeup started looking a whole
lot better
so just a little tip for you guys oh my
god this is so bad I'm gonna put makeup
on and I'm already at you I'm just using
short quick patting motions to get that
darker shade down there and you want to
do this kind of look when you have a lot
of time on your hands you don't want to
be rushing a smoky eye or a halo with
glitter it could look very messy
especially be using dark colors like
this these I'm just gonna connect the
two together I don't want it to be too
dark we just want these two shades to
kind of glide into one another and now
I'm gonna take this plummy purple this
shade right here it's called brave into
the outer and inner part of the lid same
thing that we did with the other shade
we're just making this even more intense
I'm looking down because I'm cleaning
the brush off using the same brush I
love the way I just love the shape of
this brush and I don't want to dig in
two of my other brushes so I'm just
gonna keep this one brush and use it for
the inner and outer
part of the eye so I'm going to do the
same thing just build up that intensity
I love this like plummy color feather
out the edges as you build it up it's
like you want to create a little C shape
around your eye blend your way up so it
could be gradual in gradient rather than
putting a harsh line right up on top and
then trying to blend it out gradually
work it as high up as you'd like I'm
gonna go back and forth into this shade
intensify it bring it up we'll end it
out you will see what I'm talking about
for that Center lid I'm gonna take the
new the dose of colors collaboration
with desi and Katy this is their palette
it's such a beautiful palette I'm gonna
take turbo Sun right here and this is
one of the shadows that you can use dry
and i've swatched them they are so
pigmented and then these two guys you
use wet and they look like metallic
beauty on your skin but I'm gonna take
this one right here this is like a plum
color it is so so gorgeous I thought
this shadow would work really really
good as a plum II pop in the center of
the lid as these really beautiful
reflective in it so I'm gonna take that
on my ring finger just work my finger in
there and we are going to pop it on to
the lid like so I feel like this I
shadow was meant for this look that I
created with this palette because it is
such a beautiful complement to that
plummy Brown while we're here I just
want to show you how beautiful these
shadows are so that right here I'm not
flipping you guys off I'm just trying to
do oh my god
this is such a beautiful color with the
other two shades you're supposed to wet
them I wet my finger just a little bit
this is what it looks like
I kind of want to use this just as a
bright highlight harpoon I'm so
beautiful
and then what I'm gonna do is go back
into bodacious spring that warmth back
into this area okay so now I'm just
gonna line my waterline so what I'm
gonna do is take this Mac liquid last
liner and line the upper lash line I'm
not gonna make a wing I'm just going to
literally add some definition to my lash
area so that when we put on false lashes
it just seamlessly blends together
nicely
so I'm just gonna make a line right here
so we are gonna go with these Lily
lashes right here these are in this
style Ella they're long and flirty and a
little dramatic but still PC enough so
you can see what you did on your eyelid
go ahead and do my lower lash line after
I do my foundation but this is pretty
much the eye look right here I love this
glittery eye shadow it's so pretty it
really brings a look together I love it
I love it so much we use this primer
right here from Kat Von D on my face
something I haven't used in a while I
just don't I keep using the same thing
over and over again so I'm going to try
this out and then I'm gonna use the Kat
Von D foundation which is super full
coverage and the Lockett foundation in a
medium 52 and then for concealer I'm
just gonna use some of this Turk she
taped right on the inner corners I'm
just gonna Pat that into the skin I'm
using very light hand emotions I feel
like I said a lot but it's super
necessary I don't want you guys to be
going in super hard and then it's gonna
look it's not gonna turn out the way you
want it to so I think it's important to
tell you guys how to hold the products
how much pressure it up it down so I'm
gonna brighten in contour so I'm gonna
take the Kat Von D shade + light contour
palette this is like my favorite go-to
OG contour palette and ass in DB so I'm
gonna take these two shades per usual
pop them underneath my eye to brighten
and I'm just going to look up so we
don't get any creasing work it down and
over all right so you're gonna add a
little bit more brightness to the
under-eye and it's just gonna stay in
place so it doesn't slide off of our
face so dipping into both of these guys
and I'm going to put my god my hair
looks
I'm gonna go ahead and contour the
cheeks here by the ear and then go down
I don't want to go down too far look at
that that is dark and then I'm going to
take the clean side of the brush and
then work this contour shade upwards and
then for the nose contour I'm going to
use this brush right here I'm going to
take that middle shade and a little bit
of the lighter shade together and we are
going to match that nose and then bring
it around the nose and I'm going to
soften it up with this brush right here
just patting it for bronzing up the face
I'm going to use this NARS bronzer in
casino
I always start behind your cheekbone and
then bring it in to see you can kind of
gauge how much you want I almost forgot
to go back into the eyes because we want
to finish out that lower lash line go
back into the nude beach palette and I'm
gonna take bodacious I'm gonna work that
on the lower lash line we have a hair
and that is not a mustache hair approach
part of that Russia was using made sure
to shave my mustache before I got on
here connecting it to that outer edge
and work it all the way in and then
right on the waterline I'm gonna take
the Urban Decay glide on pencil and 0 so
I'm gonna take this brush and smudge out
the black liner a little bit lower smoke
it out with that purpley shaggy's
earlier brave and work that right
underneath it alright so getting back to
the rest of the face we are going to
highlight for the highlight I'm gonna
take Lego right here flag on the
cheekbone
so now all I have left is the lips so
for the lips I'm gonna go ahead and deke
Mac's world lip pencil to line up my
lips and then I'm gonna use one of the
nude lips
let's see either more creamer or no
shade I think when did you know shade on
my lips my lips are a little dry but
this lipstick is actually really
hydrating so I feel way better about my
lips now this is the gloss in over the
top it is so beautiful let me just see
what it looks like really quick okay so
we went with the gloss on the center of
the lips the last thing that we're gonna
do is spread some fix+ all over the face
so we can make these powders look like
skin again
and let's do this
