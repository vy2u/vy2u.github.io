me
oh my god it'll stick on your teeth hey
guys welcome back to my channel and
happy Valentine's Day month and happy
birthday month to me and all the
Aquarius is out there I am gonna be
doing this really pretty pink glowing
makeup look right here perfect for date
night Valentine's Day it's very romantic
and sultry but soft at the same time I
love the way this came out I cannot wait
to show you and I want to say a big
thank you to Neutrogena for partnering
up with me on this video using their
hydro boost line which is so good
so so good I can't wait to show you how
I got this look and if you want to learn
how to get it don't forget to subscribe
to my channel and hit that notification
box you can be a part of a quad family
and without further ado let's get into
this TV so I just woke up it's early in
the morning and I my skin it looks so
sleepy and dull right now so before I
get started I'm gonna put on this hydro
boost vitamin multivitamin booster from
Neutrogena it's supposed to brighten the
skin energize it it has hyaluronic acid
in it so it's going to hydrate the skin
really well so this guy is what I'm
putting on first to wake up my dullness
entire looking face so I'm gonna put it
on my hand like this this is serum and
I'm just gonna work it into my face I
feel so hydrated and I usually do this
if I'm doing sometimes I'll use the
Neutrogena hydro boost cleanser it's
actually a habit here at the gentle
cleansing lotion for sensitive skin this
is a really good drugstore option and
Neutrogena has some amazing skin care
products I was raised with Neutrogena my
mom loves Neutrogena this is the first
skincare brand that I have ever learned
about I can always rely on teachers
units super inexpensive very effective
on the skin so I am definitely an
original lover so I'm just gonna work a
little bit more in on to my forehead
make sure my all of my face
the sir on it and you can feel the plump
in your skin instantly you can just feel
like so hydrated after the serum this is
great if you have dry skin I have dry
skin so this works really good on my
skin if you have dry skin like me oh my
god this feels so good do you see it
feels so hydrated definitely transforms
my skin to feeling from like super dry
to super supple so if you have dry skin
like me definitely pick up one of these
guys because it is going to be a skin as
a life saver my skin is prepped I'm
gonna go straight into foundation for
something more like soft and natural but
still has a nice coverage is the NARS
natural radiant long wear foundation
this is one of my favorites
amongst a bunch of my other favorite
foundations but this one looks the most
natural it feels really good on the skin
and it covers like crazy this is
Patagonia and then since I have a little
bit of a tan going on which you can't
see because I'm almost like in a
turtleneck I'm gonna mix Barcelona in
there as well it's a little bit darker
not tanning I'm just Patagonia see it
this is definitely a full coverage
foundation
it doesn't look or feel like one doesn't
get cakey isn't getting to the fine line
so that's why I'm seeing it's really
good for like a date night kind of
makeup it just makes your skin look
really soft and flawless see you like it
covers all the imperfections but it
doesn't look dry it doesn't look thick
or cakey it just looks really actually
looks kind of nice and dewy a little but
not like crazy wet looking I am loving
this foundation I just forgot how much I
loved it actually for the eyes I'm gonna
prep them with this concealer from Maya
sell
I'm really excited actually to use this
palette it's so pretty and I just love
everything that two-face comes out with
I get so excited about it cuz usually
smells good and stuff so this is the
white peach palette look at the
packaging it's so pretty I love the
packaging has little peaches on the
closure this is the palette how pretty
oh my gosh as soon as I saw this palette
I was like yes I'm going to do something
with Valentine's Day I'm gonna use these
colors right in here so the first color
I'm using is peach cream I'm gonna take
creme delle peach and pop that all over
the lid and then for the outer part of
the eye I'm going to take peach sorbet
so I'm gonna take both of those colors
on a blending brush so I'm gonna work
them on the outer part of the crease
kind of going into the outer part of the
lid
I'm just these circular motions right
here if you want to a distinct line you
can always take some tape I'm just gonna
put that right there
I wanted to have a nice strong structure
to it but I want to use soft colors so
I'm gonna use the tape as my barrier so
I don't go further than that but I'm
gonna just work in those colors right in
this spot with a very soft circular
motion the next color were picking up is
sweet fig and I'm just going to take
that on the outer part of the crease and
then for the very outer corner I'm going
to take on the grill and doing this is
just gonna make the look a little bit
more sultry but it's very soft and
romantic at the same time the color is
the darkest color in the palette is
actually very soft and it just works so
well with all the
she's the inner corners of the eye I'm
gonna go in with some concealer okay so
now that we have concealer on in the
inner half I'm gonna take glistening
peach which is this beautiful golden
pink color right here that's like an
iridescent and gold kind of look to it
it's so so pretty I'm gonna take that on
a flat brush and I'm just gonna pop that
on a right on top of that inner corner
that we concealed just go back in with
on the grill and just and then right
underneath the brow bone I'm gonna take
peach cream okay so I'm gonna add a wing
really quickly with the tardis and
double tape
okay so now we're going into the lashes
we feel like they're so important for a
Valentine's Day look because this is
what's gonna make your look super flirty
so I have these lashes here I'm trying
to figure out which one I want less
saline is a very expensive brand for
lashes and letting you guys know now but
their lashes are very very pretty these
are the Shanti lashes lash style and
while that dries move on to the lower
lash line just pop on a little bit of
shadow I think I'm gonna take sweet fig
and work that on the lower lash line and
then a little bit of on the grill right
on top of the lash line this truly gives
you like instantly a smoky kind of look
and you don't even have to really try to
smoke it out too much it just damn smoky
and lashes should be dry right now so
I'm gonna pick them up and pop them on
really quick so I'm gonna contour my
face not meeting the Kat Von D shade +
light contour palette
for blush I'm going to use the issue a
blush right here it's so pretty love the
packaging and this is the blush I'm
using it's called blood door and just
work it on the cheeks I think it's a
really nice contrast to the pink and I'm
gonna skip on the bronze or today so it
kind of acts as that as well and I'm
gonna take it right up above the
hairline right along the hairline right
in here as close as you can because
that's what makes it look most natural
when you put it right inside of that
hairline and then for the highlight I'm
going to use the color pop it in Newton
nude and oh and new window I'm gonna
take the middle shade called on the
loose just as gold highlight right here
I'm gonna use my finger for the nose
because it's such a tiny little spot I'm
gonna go right there right across
so I'm going to take this new liquid lip
from NARS I don't know the name of it
it's like a very difficult name to
pronounce for me so I'm just going to
take this it's like a nude it's just a
nude lip it's called lip cuff lip cover
