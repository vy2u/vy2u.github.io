what one more time do before you leave I
want you to know I stutter a lot in my
nose itches so bad
hey guys welcome back to my channel I'm
not bald
there is a ponytail that won't stay on
my shoulder it is being very disruptive
today I'm going to be doing this summer
bronzy glow a look it's very effortless
and it's one of those looks that are not
going to melt off your face
our melts off of your face that's what
I'm translate this is one of those looks
you can go in the Sun stay in the Sun
you're going to be looking great because
it's not that much makeup it's I don't
know if it looks like that much makeup
it doesn't look like that to me because
my skin is still showing through this is
one of those weightless natural coverage
looking books and it's one of those that
are very hydrating my skin feels so good
right now it feels very moisturized
supple something different you know I
like this I like the cake I like the
coverage so this is very different for
me and I feel like if anybody can do
this I really love this look and I think
that it's perfect for like the beach or
you're going to be out in the Sun all
day and it just looks very effortless
and healthy and glowing so if you want
to learn how to get this look don't
forget to hit that notification bell to
be a part of the Kwan family subscribe
if you haven't subscribed already and
without further ado let's get on with
this start off with my skin because skin
is so so important for any time of the
year but especially in the summer you
want your skin to stay hydrated and
personally my skin is always dry no
matter what season it is it's just it's
dry so I was really excited to team up
with Neutrogena and try the hydro boost
line you guys know I love the Neutrogena
wipes so when they asked me to do this I
was like yes so have the entire line
I've been trying it out and I wanted to
show you what I'm using I really like
how it makes my skin feels it feels
really supple and plumped throughout the
day I thought it'd be great to to
include in a summertime makeup look or
if you're going to the beach you're
going to be in the Sun
day these are just great products to
have I've been using the hydraboost
hydrating cleansing gel this takes away
all the dirt from the day and it still
keeps my skin very hydrated in this
process of washing the face and then
after I wash my face i take my hydro
boost hydrating serum it absorbs into
the skin super fast and this just helps
boost the hydration in your skin and it
lasts all day I knew that all the
hydration I can get at this point in my
life guys this is an intense moisture in
your face like it's not a cream it's
actually a water gel like it says and
it's a very lightweight even though it's
a gel and it's super lightweight it
sinks into your skin and you can
literally feel your skin it works as a
cream like the creams are very like
thick and heavy you feel like oh yeah
it's really seeping into my skin working
it's just like that but it doesn't have
that thick heavy cream feeling it's just
super lightweight I love it so after I
do my skincare and everything is ready
to go its hydrated it's plump now I feel
like I can move on and actually get into
the makeup so for the foundation I'm
going to be using this Neutrogena hydro
boost hydrating tint something that's
lightweight that's not going to weigh my
skin down so I'm gonna put some of this
on and I have the shade buff the
foundation comes with like a doe foot
applicator and I'm gonna work that on my
skin if I wanted to have something that
is light weight I would normally just
put a bunch of concealer so it can like
spread to the rest of my face because my
face is kind of uneven so I'm glad that
they have something that's lightweight
and it will even out the rest of my skin
tone I'm just going to blend it in with
my Beauty Blender just gonna wet it up a
little bit and I'm not going for a full
coverage look I just want my skin to
look hydrated healthy supple plump fresh
you know just all those things I'm going
to go ahead and conceal my under eyes
I'm going to be using the Neutrogena
hydro boost hydrating concealer as well
the concealers on the outside and then
on the inside it has a moisturizing
center if you have those like creases
underneath your eyes it's going to help
plump them up it's just an amazing
little guy
I'm just gonna put that underneath my
eyes and this is very lightweight just
like the foundation it's going to give
you a natural looking coverage really
amazed the coverages on this concealer
and the fact that it's hydrating and
this is actually pretty buildable
coverage I was a little skeptical about
it being buildable at first but I
definitely see that you can build up the
coverage on the concealer I'm also going
to do a little bit of contouring so for
that I'm going to be using the Tarte
clay stick Foundation and deep bunny I
love this for contouring because it just
glides on your skin like a dream ooh and
I like deep honey because it also kind
of gives you lip bronze look
so I just did my brows fill them in
really quick super natural very light so
now I'm going to move on to the eyes so
what I'm going to do is just go over
with a powder like something that I'm
going to use on the rest of my face
and I actually have this new blotting
powder from Kat Von D right here I love
her packaging it's so cute but this is
in shade medium so I'm just going to
take that powder I'm just going to dab
it right over my eyes my eyelids so that
everything is one color and it's set in
place and nothing is creasing and then
after we have that on our face we're
going to go ahead and create that
definition into the crease very light
and subtle for the crease I'm going to
take this brush right here this is from
Vasanti I'm actually going to be using
the Koko collection for by Kali
cosmetics this shade right here it's
just a bronzer this is her face palette
and I'm going to see how much definition
this is going to give me in the crease I
kind of feel like it's going to be light
just go back and forth when she'll wiper
motions I'm going to do the same thing
on the other eye and take flipper from
colour-pop this is one of their super
shock shadows it is so so gorgeous and I
just can't wait to dig my hand in there
it looks like this up close it's so
pretty and I'm going to pop that onto my
lid
like so just pressing it onto my lid
because I don't want this to go
everywhere I want it to be pretty
precise in that spot I'm actually going
to mix in one by one I'm going to just
pop it on to the center and see what
that looks like oh that is really pretty
I am almost done with the eyes but I
want to add just a little bit more
dimension into the crease I'm taking
this little tart Pro glow to go I'm just
going to take the chisel color right
here and I'm going to pop out onto my
crease just to really intensify the
contour I do want to add like a little
bit of a highlight to my brow bone just
like I'm Matt I'm going to take this
shade right here from my Kat Von D
palette again you don't have to do this
if you don't want to just leave it the
way it is I just want a little bit more
of a clean look for me I just feel like
it make the colors just blend a little
bit easier I love doing this to my brow
bone and then for the eyeliner I'm going
to take this is you a slim cream
eyeliner in matte Brown I like it
because the tip of this eyeliner it
comes to a sharp point which works
really well when you want to do like a
little wing I'm actually going to just
apply it normally and then smoke it out
with a brush and then I'm also going to
go back and forth with a little smudger
brush this smudger brush that I'm going
to be using is from the makeup shop this
is the t2 brush and see that really
harsh line right there I'm just going to
smudge it back and forth to soften it up
I'm going to go back in with a smudger
brush and just work it back and forth so
now I'm going to move on to the mascara
I'm going to be using this mascara right
here it's a new one from Mac it's a
collaboration with Steve J and yoni P I
just think that the packaging is so
adorable this is my favorite shade of
pink this light pastel think it's so
pretty
so let's try out the mascara see how
this works here okay so now that my eyes
are prepped with mascara I'm going to
pop on some lashes you don't have to put
lashes on if this is too much for you on
a day out and Sun and you just don't
want to worry about them I get it I just
think it completes the look and I
personally love lashes I just got these
in from time Los Angeles these are Luna
and then these are called it's ball so
pretty in PC which I love those types of
lashes because it still shows the work
you did it still shines through so
that's why I kind of like those um
actually yeah I'm gonna go with its bomb
so just gonna take these lashes off of
this little guy
okay so now I'm gonna do the lower lash
line so I'm going to go in with that
bronze from the Coco collection and this
smudger brush we used on the lash line
earlier and that just gives a little bit
more depth to the lower lash line okay
so that is pretty much it for the eyes
I'm gonna put on this guy right here
this is the hoola do the dew from
benefit it's their liquid bronzer
actually my lips are getting really dry
unintel I'm going to put on this
Neutrogena hydraboost hydrating lip
treatment it goes on so smooth it feels
it doesn't feel greasy on your face and
that's what I like about a lot of these
products it's not like a greasy feeling
even though it's very moisturizing and
hydrating and I feel like this helps
with the texture it just smoothes out
your lips completely if I don't feel
like wearing anything on my lips or if
you're going to the beach you don't feel
like doing anything else on the lips you
just want your lips to be hydrated this
is perfect to wear alone
it's also good to use as a primer okay
so now I'm going to move on to the rest
of the face I'm gonna go ahead and take
the benefit do the dew hula liquid
bronzer and put some on the back of my
hand put some right here and I'm just
gonna use my finger gonna help
everything look a lot more natural and
flawless for the cheek color I'm going
to add this the Mac ex Steve J and yoni
P collection this is a lip and cheek
color I'm gonna use this for the cheeks
only and I'm going to take this shade
right here and just pop it onto my
cheeks right now we're going to get into
the bronzer and the highlight where the
bronzer I'm going to be using the Coco
collection bronzer I'm gonna go ahead
and take that guy right there pop it
onto a brush and just work it all over
my face I'm gonna take the makeup Shack
brush in t30 I'm going to start to work
that right on the cheekbone work it up
all the way onto the forehead and then
for my cheeks I'm going to take that
pink and just take a little bit and pop
it on top just a tad bit and then blend
it into that bronzer so now I'm going to
go ahead and highlight my face I'm going
to be using the highlight from the cocoa
collections is nine nine oh two one oh
and pop that on to the tops of my cheeks
my cheekbone and this is the Moorthy M
510 brush these guys are wondering and
actually I'm going to mix in a root
Beverly Hills and I'm going to bring it
around the warhead again is a shape that
if you already have oily skin you don't
have to you can skip your nose and your
cheese zone area um I personally like
the way it looks on the nose on the tip
of the nose
on the bridge and also I'm going to pop
that on to the inner corner so that just
think it looks really pretty I'm gonna
take this brushes the morphe y22 brush
pop it into both of those shades because
they look really good together
with a clean brush and just make sure
that everything is blended moving on to
the lips I'm going to go ahead and take
this Neutrogena hydraboost hydrating lip
shine and this is in the shade berry
brown so I'm going to pop this color on
and I like the little ones
it's so like lushy and it just goes over
the entire lip with like one swipe this
makes your lips feel so crazy smooth I
can just keep putting it on because it
feels so good to finish everything off
I'm going to actually just mac fix+ if
you really want an intense highlight go
ahead and spritz on the fix+ go back
into your highlights and then just pop
on a little bit more now I'm going to go
ahead and spritz on some of this bronze
goddess and it has these little golden
shimmers in it so pretty so that is the
