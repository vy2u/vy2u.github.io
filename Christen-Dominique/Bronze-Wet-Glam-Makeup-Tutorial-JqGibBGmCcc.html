today I am doing this wet and glam look
right here that is very much inspired by
Selena Gomez I found this picture of her
the other day and actually did a
snapchat tutorial on it or was it in
some stories I think was snapchat and
it's this look right here she is so
beautiful we have the same haircut
can you tell can you tell I was so
excited about that and I just love this
classic red-carpet look so I wanted to
do my own interpretation of this look
and this is what I created I've been
seeing this white hair look go around
Kim Kardashian's been wearing it a lot
Selena Gomez oh this is my last video
it's actually really super easy I wish I
would have showed you in this video I'm
not like a pro at doing this look yet so
I didn't want to like do a tutorial if I
really don't know exactly what I'm doing
but if you want to see a tutorial on
this I can definitely show you after
I've practiced a little bit more on it I
don't know I just love this look on
everybody I think it's gonna look great
on you your brother your sister your mom
your grandma give everybody a makeover
in the house today because we are doing
this look and before we get into the
video don't forget to subscribe to my
channel and hit that notification bell
so you can be a part of the quad family
and without further ado let's get on
with the video first thing that I'm
grabbing is the boying
industrial-strength concealer from
benefit I'm gonna use that to just kind
of prime my eyes and even out the skin
on this area right here
now that it is nice and even I'm gonna
be using this eyeshadow color right here
this is the collaboration with candy
Johnson from Too Faced the I want candy
palette I am very excited actually let
me use my fancy hand right now because
this is my ratchet hand the Too Faced I
want candy palette it is so cute it's in
this little tin has a little sticker
with Kent looks like Candy's face on it
it is adorable and the pellet smells
really nice I don't know if it smells
like anything it smells kind of sweet
but I don't know if it's just me you
know too matte shades in one highlight a
shade ooh whoa that was literally one
swipe whoa very good color payoff so the
first color that I'm gonna try is banana
cream pie as you guys know you guys know
this already
after the concealer I set it with a
powder and I usually use something
similar to like this shade right here if
I don't show you on a camera in the
video trust me I did it off camera I
don't do this every time I do my makeup
if I'm not doing much to my eyes if I'm
just doing it very natural like eyeliner
lashes and maybe just like a crease
color I won't
I won't go through this every time to be
honest with you guys but if I want to do
it right if I'm doing a YouTube video
and I'm doing something with the eyes I
do really want to have a really nice and
vibrant eyeshadow look the next colors
I'm picking up is cream puff and pastry
and I'm gonna work that on to the crease
I'm gonna work this into the crease so
we can have a nice natural-looking depth
remember for wanting to buff out any
edges we just use a softer hand so I'm
going to go in circular motions with a
very light hand just to buff out this
area right here now I'm gonna take
butterscotch kind of looks similar to
the color that Selena Gomez has in the
picture so with this color I'm gonna
take it on butterscotch shade all over
the lid and bring it into that crease
then I'm gonna take raspberry cocoa use
the same crease brush and just work it
on to this outer portion of the eye and
then I'm gonna blend this all the way up
into the brow bone I'm taking it up a
little bit higher because I want to
change the shape of my eye a little
I'm gonna go from here all the way to
here and I'm just gonna use circular
motions to get there then I'm gonna
bring it into the crease the next chord
I'm gonna take is hot chocolate right
here just a matte Brown I'm gonna use a
smaller brush for this this is the luck
C 231 a small tapered brush and I'm just
going to take some of the brown and
enhance this outer V portion right here
I'm only gonna keep this on the very
outer part of the lid and then whatever
I have on the brush I'm just going to
blend blend through this here I have a
tip for you guys if you want a really
intense outer V I would suggest
gradually getting there and try not to
just grab as much product as possible
it's going to get so patchy and so hard
to Belen when you put so much product on
at one time so my tip for you guys today
is just to use a little bit at a time
until you build up to the intensity that
you want to blend out the edges I'm
gonna take raspberry cocoa and a fluffy
brush and I'm just gonna work it around
the edges of the darker shadow and I'm
bringing it all the way up into the brow
bone just to give it a little bit more
of a dramatic effect on the inner corner
I'm going to take this shade right here
this is sparkling cider
so I'm gonna start on the wing for that
I'm going to use the taupe berry and
licorice rope and start to create the
wing I'm going to inch my way in because
I don't want it to be too thick here
and then for the liquid liner I'm going
to go in with this one right here from
Too Faced I want candy collection this
is the candy liner in black licorice and
so I'm going to take that and really
define the eye oh this is cool
make sure you close up of this this is
the wand it's really cool and different
you have trouble creating a wing I feel
like this would make it easier because
it already has that slanted edge for you
I'm gonna layer another pair of lashes
on top these are the house of lashes so
for our collection and the style
everlasting they look like this they're
tapered curled and kind of fluffy
looking so I'm gonna go ahead and pop
these on right on top I'm gonna take the
Smashbox photo finish primer and work
that into my hands and then Pat it into
my face I'm actually going to color
correct my face today so I'm going to
take this Stila correct imperfect and
take this peach shade right here and
work that on my under eyes and with the
peach one does is it neutralizes the
bluish purple under a circle for medium
to light skin tones if you have a darker
skin tone you want to use this orange
shade right here and then I'm going to
take this yellow shade right here and
this is for dark spots so I'm gonna take
that around the mouth cuz you can see
it's a little dark in this area and then
it's red right around my nose right on
my cheek so I'm gonna take some of that
on my cheeks as well and then I'm gonna
take this smashbox face shaping a studio
skin and a foundation stick this is the
contour that i've been using i used in
my last video and i've been using it
ever since i got this product this is
actually the first time i'm using the
foundation side so i'm going to take the
foundation in 2.2 and work that on for
the face
this soft contour side and I'm just
going to contour my cheeks
okay and then for concealer I'm going to
take this benefit boying
industrial-strength concealer and a
number two and I'm gonna work that on my
under eyes I'm just gonna use my finger
to Pat it in and then I'm gonna take my
tiny little baby Beauty Blender work it
into the rest of my face I like to be
the mini Beauty Blender because if you
want a contour or highlight in a precise
area it will do that for you without
getting it all over the place like with
this big big Beauty Blender
so having these little mini PD plungers
at first I was like what am I gonna do
with this does nothing but then I found
a really good use for them it's the
beauty blenders little mini Wow's the
first time that I'm not using the Tarte
shaped Cape to come from my under-eye
circles I did a really good job I'm
gonna set my face with the Kat Von D at
translucent setting powder I'm gonna
take some of this on the back of a
Beauty Blender and set my under eyes
always like stretch my eyeballs in the
back of my head so that the skin is
super taut and I don't get any lines so
look way up I'm gonna pack the
transition light the transition powder
on so that nothing creases underneath
your eye area and now that I'm set my
face is pretty much set I'm gonna go
back into the lower lash line and I'm
not really gonna do much to the lower
lash line just adding a black liner so
I'm taking that aqua XL liner we used
earlier and I'm just gonna line the
bottom just smoke it out I'm gonna take
this Sigma short shader brush and brush
it along the line right underneath so it
kind of drags down that black liner and
now I'm just gonna add a lot of mascara
to my lower lash line that's lower lash
goals I am gonna try to attempt to make
my lashes that long
one thing that I noticed about the
pictures that Selena is super bronzed I
don't know she has a tan it's natural
this is NARS Laguna and I feel like this
is a little bit more on the warm tone
side this gives you more of a no it's
not too ashy you can actually some
people may use this as a contour but I
actually think this will work great as a
bronzer it has a little bit of that warm
undertone and I'm just going to start to
work that on my cheekbone so I'm going
to take it around my temples right here
and then and then on the nose especially
right across like that gives you like a
natural looking glow just looks like you
went tanning I'm gonna mix this bronzer
as well I feel like this is a lot more
of a has it more of an orange look to it
this is bronze goddess imma layer that
right on top as if it's a blush and then
I'm gonna take this big powder brush and
blend out this blush and then for the
highlight I'm gonna take this Oprah
highlighter in Bali put that on my
cheekbones tip of the nose right on the
Cupid's bow and a right on top of the
brow and then for the star of the show
I'm gonna be using this red lipstick
right here it's that ultra matte lip
from colour-pop in it's a collaboration
with Karen I love Sarah II it is such a
beautiful red it's a red that you want
as your staple just sayin
