happiness shake up the happiness it's
Christmas time there's a story that I
was told and I wanna tell the world
before I get too old and don't remember
it
so let's December it and reassemble that
oh yeah
hello my friends I know it's been awhile
and so excited to be back for my little
break with a Christmas hardy completed
look including hair makeup and outfit
with the makeup I wanted to try to take
holiday colors make it wearable yet
simple don't forget all the products
used including my outfit details will be
listed below I hope you enjoyed the
video and now let's just start the happy
wake up the happiness for this look I
wanted big voluminous curls so today
I'll be using extensions I don't
normally wear them but I wanted to add
some extra fullness to my hair so I'll
be using the luxury for princess 22 inch
hair extensions in chocolate brown I've
just sectioned off a piece of my hair
and then clip them in at the root and
let the hair down section off a second
piece of my hair flip in the second
piece and let the rest of my hair down
after I've done that I brush it all out
and as you can see it adds a natural
fullness to your hair without having to
damage and tease it
to get those big curls and using my nume
32 inch curling wand and here's a random
question would you rather have big curls
or sleek straight hair for a holiday
party comment below and a lucky
subscriber will get a surprise
I'm loving this Big Texan hair if you
didn't know I am a Texan girl hashtag
long hair don't care now it's time to
show you my Christmas inspired makeup
look start off I'm going to take my baby
lips doctor ready lip balm in my EOS lip
balm yes I'm using two it's definitely
needed trust me guys this weather is no
joke on my skin and after that I'm going
to take my Urban Decay vice 2 palette
using the color dope and just applying
it all over my lids for the inner
corners and taking this white shimmery
shadow that came in this month's Ipsy
bag from the pop Beauty eyeshadow trio
and smoking hot taking my Mirabella eye
blender brush in picking up that gray
color and sweeping it on to my crease
now to add a sultry haze to our eyes I'm
using the darkest color in the palette
I'm applying it to the outer half of the
lid forming a V into the outer crease
now to smooth out the edges to highlight
the brow bone I'm using a matte bone
color to offset the shimmer shadows
when going for a wearable look try to
mix up your matte and shimmer colors now
I'm just applying my winged liner
with a black pencil liner define your
eyes by lining the lower waterline to
add a pop of festive color I'm taking
this green color from my Urban Decay
vice 2 palette and the color damage and
applying it to the lower half of the
lash line a generous coats of mascara to
the top and bottom lashes and now it's
time for the falsies I'm using these
Katy Perry color pop lashes these have a
pop of green color mixed with black
lashes so that it's more wearable and
you can definitely pull this off for a
holiday party if you don't like how
green it is which it really isn't
overbearing at all then you can just
apply black mascara over it for those
just pinched cheeks
I'm taking my be a bombshell the one
stick today I'll be using this on my
cheeks the color I'm using is fluster
which i think is truly the perfect name
for this color it gives you the perfect
flush of natural color for this classic
red holiday lips I'm using the J Kat
Beauty big lip pencil and red rose I
wanted to add more definition to my
outer V so I just went back into the
smokin'-hot palette and took the darkest
color using my pencil brush to define my
outer V in case you're wondering what
I'm wearing on my nails its Starling
nail polish and the color buzzbuzz it's
a clear base with yellow and black
glitter which finishes this holiday look
off pretty nicely if you stayed until
this point then you know that I'm doing
a giveaway on each video this month if
you answer one of my random questions I
will randomly select a winner and send
you your gift from me to you because I
love you and today you'll either get a
new me 25 inch curling wand or Nunis
straightener depending on your answer as
