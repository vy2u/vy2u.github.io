today we're getting ready for a date
we're gonna get ready for a date
together here we go I feel like this
pink is screaming at me right now but
it's okay
it's very flirty and different and fun
and the eyes I'm went for a little bit
of a cut crease a little it's glam but
it's not like crazy it's not gonna scare
them away so if you want to learn how to
get this look don't forget to subscribe
to my channel and hit that notification
bell so you can be a part of the quad
family and without further ado let's get
on with I'm gonna be using some stuff
from the Ipsy glam bag this month so
this is the bag if you see anything
that's travel sized it's because it's
from the way I'm bag and I've partnered
with Ipsy for this video let's get
started with a face so the first thing
in my bag is this neo Gen der Balaji
white truffle serum in an oil drop so
this is supposed to give you intense
hydration and leave your skin moist and
supple so I'm all about that let's try
it out right now on our face okay here
we go
looks like so I'm just gonna work that
into my skin for an oil it doesn't feel
very oily which is good the only bad
thing about putting your eyebrows on
before is that if you're putting any
kind of foundation with cream primer on
your face you have to be super careful
because you will have eyebrow all over
your face which is kind of hard not to
do but you know out oh my gosh what is
that that is my skin I have a skin tag
right there shoot I'm gonna use all the
face products before I start on the eyes
because I want it to soak into my skin
and really set so I'm gonna take the
Smashbox photo-finish radiance primer
and apply that to my face you can
actually also use this as a targeted
highlight you know I was like a base but
I'm gonna use it let's see let's see I
don't know I've never used this before
let's see how intense the highlight is
or the radiance is on this and
put it on my hand to kind of figure that
out because I can't have crazy okay yeah
okay this is gonna give me a ton of
luminosity so I'm just gonna target this
in certain areas of my face that I want
to highlight it so the bridge of my nose
my Cupid's bow right on the cheekbone
and you can use this alone just to give
your skin a natural looking glow and
this is a moisturizing primer cream it's
supposed to give you that Magic Hour
glow I'm also gonna put it right on the
like right above the brow where the
light wouldn't actually hit your
forehead that's where I'm gonna
intensify the highlight it is very it
does feel very moisturizing on those
areas so that's a plus you can put a
little bit on my chin if you're oily you
can totally skip this stuff I always say
that because I have dry skin in a lot of
you and if you're new to my channel you
don't know that I'm gonna be like
where's your doing putting highlight on
a chin but I have dry skin so I need all
the radiance luminosity but not
everywhere because I also have texture
and acne scarring so I have to be really
careful where I want to illuminate my
face because it can look really crazy
really fast
that's pretty I would even wear this
like if I were a BB cream I would wear
this alone with a BB cream I think that
would look really pretty it just makes
your skin look really healthy and glowy
like naturally glowing so I'm gonna let
that sit into my skin now I'm gonna move
on to my eyes okay wait let me set my
eyes first
okay so the pallet that I'm gonna be
using is this one right here from the
makeup Shack
it's called Muse and it is huge like the
pan sizes are humongous I'll give that
and there's some mattes and shimmers I'm
gonna go ahead and first try iconic
gonna take this shade right here and I'm
just gonna work that on the crease just
like this with a big fluffy brush just
to give us a natural depth going through
our crease I'm gonna do that on both
sides just go back and forth in these
little windshield wiper motion and I'm
using a light hand to sweep that on my
eyes I'll press down to hard because
you're you don't want any muddy spots
that you can't blend out later so this
is very light here and go back and forth
the next Klarman going to is reezy so
I'm gonna take a flat shader brush which
is already kind of used up just try to
wipe it off on my pants I'm so lazy like
if I'm filming I'll just wipe everything
on my pants and I'll just look like a
dirty mess when I get up and that's just
my life so I'm gonna do is take a flat
shader brush like this this is from
zoeva it's the 234 okay so I'm gonna do
like a cut crease right in here I'm
gonna follow this shadow that my eye
naturally has and I like to keep this
side as clean as possible because we're
gonna blend up with that side so we're
laying the color down first on the
crease and I'm using a very light hand
and just dragging the brush across like
this following the shadow and once you
have the intensity of the color that you
want now I'm gonna flip my brush over to
the clean side and we're gonna just
brush upwards
I'm gonna take this clean brush right
here mmm this is the time Los Angeles
204 and I'm just gonna go back and forth
right here very lightly I'm gonna take
another brush that's pretty similar to
this one because I'm gonna take a darker
shade I'm gonna take this shape this
brush right here it's super tiny I like
to use this on my lower lash line
because how dense close together that
the bristles are so it lays down more
color so I'm gonna take Luna the shade
right above it and go right underneath
take another brush and do the same thing
and brush upwards very lightly buff out
the edges of that now I'm gonna get some
concealer put it on the back of my hand
and amazing this could be a brush right
here from the makeup shock
let's see T 86 and I'm just gonna take
some concealer and start to carve this
out and really sharpen up that crease
I'm actually going to take of more
narrow brush this one right here and I'm
gonna flick this out now I'm just going
to carve out my underneath my brow with
the same concealer and also fix my brows
a little bit and really make this look
nice and clean and crisp using the
little Beauty Blender helps buff
everything out so nicely so I like to
keep this guy around for like for this
area right here so for the entire lid
I'm gonna go over with this shade right
here from Elizabeth Mott this is the pop
goes the shadow in the shade toasted
it's a really pretty taupe eesh immer it
is so pretty I actually swatch it
already on my hand and I'm gonna Pat it
into the lid this shadow is nice and
creamy I'm just gonna follow this little
outline is definitely a buildable shadow
so you can start off sheer and then you
can build up the intensity actually
gonna take a darker color and really
intensify that cut crease so I'm going
to take chocolate-dipped from the Too
Faced Just Peachy palette just a darker
shade run it through the crease
and then I'm just gonna create a wing on
the top so I can fly away so I'm gonna
apply a black mascara this is from Tarte
this is the lights camera lashes four in
one mascara and this is good for
volumizing curling lengthening it does
everything and I love the one because
it's so skinny
it's but it's not too skinny to wear you
can only use it on your lower lashes
this is just a perfect amount of volume
in a brush for the lower and upper
lashes so I'm just gonna work that into
my lashes just using these roll wiggle
emotions I'm gonna use the little lashes
in the style NYC I'm gonna pop them on
real quick and I'll be back with some
fluffy lashes I feel like I'm a surgeon
I'm like scalpel
so there's tweezers glue I'm back at my
lashes on now I'm gonna put on some
foundation I'm gonna use this foundation
right here I just got it in it's from
Dior it's the air flash the spray so I'm
gonna spray it on my hand first because
if I spray it on my face that'll be a
terrible mistake so I'm just gonna take
my Beauty Blender and work okay this is
too dark
my skin my body's actually pretty dark
so I'm just gonna put on a light layer
this actually I think I can use this I
think it will blend into the rest of my
body
I'm going to take my heart-shaped tape
concealer and just conceal my under eyes
I'm also just going to highlight with
this I'm gonna take iconic and run it
down the lower lash line not thinking it
too dark right here I just want to just
want a little bit of death right in here
do a little bit of contour snatch the
cheekbones give ourselves a nose job I
honestly feel like a makeup surgeon
because of what I create on my face is
literally surgery with makeup just gonna
add a little bit of bronzer on my face
so I'm taking this bronzer from Estee
Lauder it's the bronze goddess and we're
just gonna work that all around my cheek
bone around the temple right along the
forehead and then I'm gonna take a blush
I'm gonna actually run that down my nose
then I'm gonna take a blush from Tarte
it's the big blush book they came out
with and this is number three and they
have a really pretty matte blush that I
want to use this is called mindful love
the name and the color so I'm gonna take
this color right here pop it on my
cheeks right behind the Apple into the
hairline if you had texture skin if you
have textured skin these matte blushes
look really great on you if you have a
really nice smooth skin and then you can
go in with these shimmery shade your
skin will look so beautiful and glowing
so I'm gonna skip that part because I'm
a little help in that area so I'm gonna
set my the rest of my face using the
peach blur I just feel like it minimizes
the texture on my face it just looks
like you have a filter on it so I'm just
gonna put a little bit of that all over
and then lately I've been obsessed with
this banana powder that candy came out
with with the Too Faced I really hope
that they just make this a staple
because it's so beautiful for the under
eyes so I'm gonna take it right on the
under eyes and what I like about it is
that it's not super bright white has a
yellow undertone so it kind of
neutralizes the under eye circle and it
kind of meshes with the rest of your
skin and it just looks like a natural
healthy under eye or the highlight today
I'm going to take this pixi by petra
Beauty blush duo in
honey and there's just two really nice
silky highlights I'm gonna go ahead and
take these blushes with my little
blushes highlight I'm gonna take this
brush right here and grab some of this
really pretty highlight and start to fit
it on the high points of my face this is
a really nice natural-looking highlight
it's not too it's not like super intense
blinding I love that look as well but
this is a really nice fresh look like a
silky highlight I like it I like it a
lot
so now we're moving on to the lips for
the lip I'm using this color pop lippie
stix
in the shade glam bag it's a matte lip
II stick so this shade was selected by
the FC community and was exclusively
made for this September glam bag it is a
very pretty color and I'm going to pop
that on my lips it's a very full
coverage matte formula and it's super
lightweight in velvety and I just really
love how this lip complements the eye I
think it's such a beautiful combo and
right on the center I'm gonna pop on
this lip gloss right here from dirty
little secret cosmetics such a cute
package and this is in the shade nude
beach it's supposed to be a really nice
lightweight formula and it's actually
smells really good and it's not supposed
to be sticky at all which I already feel
that it isn't thank you guys for
