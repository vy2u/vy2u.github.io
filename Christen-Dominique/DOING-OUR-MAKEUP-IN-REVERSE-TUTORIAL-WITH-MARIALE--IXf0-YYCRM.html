such an interesting video today I saw a
few people doing this video Tati do
Charles this looks like so much fun we'd
ordered makeup a little bit different it
was interesting trying to think of what
our steps are backwards so it was really
hard but this is what we came up with
and I think we did pretty good I think
we look pretty good look amazing
you look amazing and don't forget to
watch Mars video on her channel we did
some crazy crazy things like I'm not
gonna even tell you guys but I just
it was insane like fun and we have very
few products to do this with make sure

be a part of the quad family and without
further ado let's get in to this video I
have to guide me what do you end with or
sightings okay this is setting spray and
primer that one's good cuz you can
either start or finish with it you can
borrow stuff now right yeah cuz you
couldn't get my video No our video is
crazy let me just tell you how to go
watch that video okay look it sprays
really hard yeah it's hard to break last
thing I do is put gloss in the center of
my lips okay I don't do that okay what
do you do I'm gonna take a gloss the
last thing I do I guess it would be
putting on lipstick lipstick so this is
weird because I usually do liquid lip
and men gloss in the center so so weird
but
oh okay time to be lip this is Stone Fox
well it's not gonna be so dry I'm gonna
take this one it's called a P from
colour-pop where those look silk rules
because I'm usually like have to prep
them I know my also dry and imagine just
walking around like this
I do lip liner you don't it's good so
many stuffs so we need to think what are
we doing this looks weird with like my
face looking like this no you're talking
about it looks so good I use like a
powder to set my face I guess wait oh my
god we're going for it I'm purposely not
using that much yeah he's so confused
you're gonna write it down no I'm gonna
look at a video and see the order that I
do it so I don't get confused you know I
mean it's so strange using this crazy oh
my gosh
before the lips I set my under eyes it's
gonna be so wrong with the banana yeah
not yours no this is mine cuz it's so
dirty see it's well loved okay here we
go
we're studying my undereyes super light
this is gonna feel so wrong on so many
levels so I'm gonna take the Nilla cream
and work under eyes my face feels so dry
right now same dis gross
how about to do something really weird
so I'm just gonna highlight I'm gonna
put foundation over this
yeah okay
mmm-hmm my contour go for it
do you concert with powder with me I
contour with powder but I'm not gonna be
able to come back from that I'm gonna
use the Tarte Pro glow I'm gonna take
the shade shade that's what it's called
shade who the shade the shade girl and
work it into my feet oh wow that's
really dark I'm just you're like
learning like I'm gonna do a little
cheek surgery okay now I'm gonna do the
nose
did you contour already I need to learn
I'm gonna try to contour it since you're
doing it I feel like if I contour my
nose it looks bigger
I'm gonna take my finger into vanilla
cream and go down my nose I feel like I
look like a bad town
oh no I knows what to Miami bye
I do concealer over my foundation so I
do concealer thank you yes yes yes okay
so I'm gonna take I've been using the
Mac one a lot the studio water weight
concealer it's super lightweight but
it's full coverage so it doesn't feel
like anything on top of my christy
powder my own face feels present I know
which is in there do you use oh my god I
love this Smashbox Studios I like the
foundation from them too yeah I usually
put it on like this like one thick
slight thing yeah it really looks like a
lot better now it's starting to come
together you can see there's like
everything without eyebrows I feel like
an alien
I'm gonna take the LC microsil
foundation have you tried this no oh
it's so good all my secrets I hope this
is my shake is the only foundation I
brought tried to not put it over the
contour is that cheating would that be
cheating I mean you can't just do it
lightly you already did it bronzer and
nobody said rules I feel like there
should be a rule where if you miss
bronzer you could just do it out there
yes for you this is very good just for
you yeah I'm making up the rules right
now we have
new rule book okay foundation lower
mascara is so weird I'm take mocha cuz
that's what I would and my eyeshadow
with did you put on oh wait you haven't
done eyeshadow yet right no that's the
first thing you do
yes kit oh yeah you forgot I like well
you forgot so many things I don't know
look at your tutorial I told you to look
at it okay well I'm gonna take macchiato
pop that on my highlight spot so yeah
put on shadow after all right it's
coming together
oka on the lower lashline what's your
favorite shape yeah I know mine
I love these oh those are really good
though yeah yeah but the yellow cuz I
multi-purpose it and according to me
banana cream what mine is hazelnut he's
a nut yeah I love hazel I could just use
it for so many things caramel my skin is
feel so wet yeah he's such a long lashes
I feel like I'm hairy I feel like a
hairy monster you're like are those
extensions to her hair is expensive no
lashes I don't need to Coleman do you
want to see my legs show me those hairy
legs well you know that was such a
struggle like in middle school girl and
like my mom wouldn't let me shave once I
was like me too no way I have hairy legs
until I was 15 years old so I would what
I would do though is I would get
scissors and I'll try to sneak it to
make them shorter like this house so
that that wasn't much I didn't know such
a good girl these are from less saline
I'm just gonna grab these guys those are
so pretty
have you tried the dove ones yeah yeah
does she have like three different ones
I really liked one of them that was like
very fluffy mm-hmm she's so pretty
she's very pretty
well the motor I'll take up Bellamy has
some good lashes if I do liner it's like
a brow I said my eyes are really small
and like close together so we're mine
mines are close together that's why I
always keep everything on this like the
outer part your eyes are not knock you
know look at it look at mine you know
it's so sexy
yeah so weird that I'm not setting my
eyes I always set my eyes before I do
eyeshadow okay so I'm just gonna take
macchiato pop it on the center because
we're gonna do a halo do you do your
brows before your shadow yeah I do my
brows first before you do foundation
sometimes yeah right
we'll be do I shadow backwards or no I'm
doing it backwards it's like I did like
I would usually do this last like
highlighting under mine oh yeah yeah at
the other party just like I don't do it
randomly I just did where we going
tonight and whether I love this color
I'll take double shot I don't know if
you're supposed to do your eyeshadow
backwards that I'm doing it backwards
now I get to do the brows I'm very
excited about this
I've had no brows imagine if like we
went back to the days where we didn't
really pay attention to brows I used to
