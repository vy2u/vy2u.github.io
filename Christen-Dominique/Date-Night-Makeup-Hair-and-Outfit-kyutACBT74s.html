channel today I am obviously in a
different space this is my office slash
Beauty room I will be doing a room
makeup tour office slash Beauty room
tour later so expect that very soon to
be doing this date night look tonight
because me and my husband are going on a
little date and I wanted to look more
dramatic I decided to go for a dark lip
and a dark eye I know you guys are going
to love it and if you want to learn how
to get it in so the first thing I am
going to start off with is moisturizing
my face make sure that it's ready for
all the makeup that we are going to
apply on it today I'm gonna start off
with using my Dermalogica clear start
Oriole clearing matte moisturizer you
know I love things that are matte so
this is going to help with all of my
acne breakouts um stuff which is great
and it's not going to clog my pores it's
light so let's do this so I'm going to
put a little bit on here I got this from
the Ipsy glam bag um I'm going to put
this on my face make sure that it's nice
and hydrated it's not oily at all so if
you have oily skin you're gonna rub this
um yeah now that our skin is nice and
moisturized I'm going to go ahead and
add some primer I'm using this one here
this Too Faced hangover RX hydrating
primer and it also promotes elasticity
in your skin and brings out that
radiance in your
so this is one of my favorite primers
it's definitely one of my favorite ab a
few sorry about that this really makes
your skin just feel a hundred times
better has just a refreshing feel to it
we have moisturizer face if you hear
that crinkling noise that's boba she's
over there
she is currently in isolation she has a
big spot for herself but we can't
actually come in contact with her right
now because she has something that we
can't charge most we will get it it's
gonna be like that for another week poor
little boba but that's her playing
messing with the paper she likes to play
with paper so that's her oh my god my
eyes are burning I'm back I think now
I'm just going to put on some chapstick
so that my lips are ready for lipsticks
I'm going to do something a little bit
dark tonight I'm going to use a dark
lipstick today so I want to make sure my
lips are hydrated I'm going to use the
hello a fresh eco beauty lip treat so
actually before I start mini is a little
bit of my Mac prep is I'm just spritz
all over my face let me take my Beauty
Blender and I'm gonna use my Kat Von D
lock-it tattoo foundation and this is in
medium 56 I'm going to use this one
because I'm gonna be out all night and I
want my makeup to last I want to look
flawless for my hubby tonight so I'm
just gonna apply that as you can see
it's a really thick foundation so I only
use this when I mean like on a date with
my hubby or I'm going to an event and
taking a lot of pictures or something
like that
you don't really have to do much to hide
your blemishes because you just Pat it
on there and it's gone that's what I
really like about this foundation it is
a little dark because I I got this when
I was tanning
I haven't been tanning for a while cuz
I've been trying to do some laser hair
removal trying not to tan it's just so
hard so I've been having to reschedule
my laser hair removal appointment look
through the noise
my neck a little bit on my chest and
over my eye ball eye sockets for
concealer I am using my NARS radiant
creamy concealer in medium custard then
I put that a little bit under the eye
nose forehead lip and right there so now
I'm going to blend in my concealer I'm
using my favorite foundation concealer
sponge this is the Beauty Blender it's
literally God's gift to everyone who
applies liquids to their face because it
makes you look super flawless I'm going
to do a little bit of baking I've been
doing this recently in pictures it looks
amazing it just adds an extra intense
definition to your face gives you that
matte highlight that that's bobba so I'm
going to use the city color HD powder
it's going to leave your skin looking
very matte and poreless so this works
for me because my pores are pretty large
actually I'm gonna go on my chin first
then under my eyes
so I'm gonna let this bake on my face
for about 10 minutes so I'm going to go
on and move on to my brow these hairs on
my brows that just go straight down so I
decided to while my brows were already
done just cut that area and I did it but
I actually ended up taking out my entire
brow so I didn't realize that until
afterwards so that's what happened this
is why I have no brow right here so I'm
gonna in a way I kind of it's not bad
because I have a lot of control on how I
want it to look so that's a good thing
but for now I just have to wait for my
brow to to grow out so for my brows I'm
going to take my dip brow pomade in from
Anastasia in ash Brown and this is a
Tarte eyebrow brush I'm going to take
that a little bit of the dip brow and
fill it in just however I want it to go
because it can go either way so you have
so much control actually can make it
higher or lower I don't suggest you go
ahead and shave off the end of your brow
please do not do that but I'm saying if
it happens it's okay
after my pomade I'll go in with a powder
just fill in so I'm using my brow bar to
go by gerard cosmetic and I'm taking
this looks so funny it's gonna look
better at the end watch when I knock it
off you're gonna love it and just fill
in the areas where they were sparse just
so I know that that dip brow is going to
stay in place if you go over the areas
that are naturally full it's just going
to look way overdone so it'll look more
natural and a lot cleaner if you just
focus on the areas where they're more
sparse like that you're done with that
you can go over with a little bit of
concealer just to make sure that
everything
really neat and clean just sharp sharp
sharp I'm doing this because it's a date
night and I want it to look very clean
sharp in fierce so I'm going to go ahead
and do a little bit of concealer I'm
using the Anasazi concealer in 1.5 going
underneath the brow like that and if you
decide not to put a highlight on then
you already got a highlight pull the
concealer down like that downward so
it's been a little while since I've had
this on so I'm going to go ahead and
knock it off so I'm just going to knock
it off with this big fluffy brush for my
eyes I'm going to use the Make Up For
Ever palette from Janie Chung and it's
these colors right here so I'm going to
start off by using this highlight right
here i'ma start with a highlight going
to start by patting it onto your brow
bone and then slowly work it down into
the entire lid so it's going to be your
base color using this color right here
I'm going to go over the top onto the
crease and lid
I'm also just going to sweep a little
bit on the lower part of the lash line
this pallet doesn't have a second or
third transition color in it for me so
I'm going to take up a different palette
for that and I think I'm going to take
my Too Faced chocolate palette work it
into the crease of gray here so I
brought it down to my lid and then I
went in with my Mac 222 and blended out
the edges make sure everything's nice
and soft for the lid I'm going to use
this color right here it's like a muted
green with gold flecks and it's very
pretty
see that I get the most intensity out of
this color I'm going to go ahead and
spray some fix+ onto my brush pick up
some of the eyeshadow and apply it to my
lid
while I was off the camera I went in
with my semi-sweet chocolate bar palette
and I tried this color right here and
it's truffled and I went in and I use my
224 brush just to deepen up the crease a
little bit more and really add some more
drama to the eye so I really liked how
it looked and decided I'm going to do
the other eye with it so I'm going to
show you guys what I did I just went
into the crease with a more tapered
brush didn't touch that lid color at all
and just went around okay so now that
I'm done with my eye shadow I'm going to
go ahead and apply a eyeliner and this
one is from star luxe this is the star
luxe pro luxe long wear eyeliner pen it
has a gel finish so it's super pigmented
I'm going to go ahead and use this on my
top lash line on the I just glides so
softly um I really like this I think I'm
going to be using this more often so now
I'm going to go in with a fun eyeliner
color I'm going to use this one from
skin it's the skin cosmetics luxe
waterproof eyeliner in navy seal the
cool thing about this is it's waterproof
so it's going to last you all night I'm
going to pop this onto the upper and
bottom waterline so that is really
pretty it's very pigmented creamy and it
just adds a really nice touch to the eye
look these are the Huntington Beach
lashes from California cosmetics and
we're going to put them on right now so
I'm going to put these on off mat off
camera and I will be back with BAM
lashes all right so now I'm back I have
my lashes on head and use my buxom blush
this is rendezvous I'm using this one
right here
you can add a pink lipstick this one is
from Noah it's the cutest little pink
lipstick I'm next show you how this
would look but I'm actually going to go
out with a deep lip so let's go ahead
and do this one so you can do a lighter
pink lipstick this one is the Neue
natural lipstick in desert rose it's
very pretty and soft if you like this
one you can definitely recreate it like
this or you can do the darker lip which
I will show you right now look for a
more sultry look I'm using the NYX
liquid suede lipstick and vintage you
guys let me know in the comments which
look you would wear finally it's time to
glam up my hair I'm going to go ahead
and use my nume lustrum set and it comes
with five different interchangeable
wands which is awesome they're all
different sizes I'm going to take the
largest wand in the set which is the 32
millimeter one and just click it on to
the handle and then it heats up
instantly I'm going to go ahead and curl
my hair with this when you do big
voluminous curls I'm going to take 1
inch of hair wrap it around the barrel
gonna hold it for about 5 seconds let it
go and you're gonna have a very defined
curl that will last you literally until
you wash your hair nume curling wands
are my favorite curling wands I don't
use anything else that's all that I use
and this is why I love them so much and
then I just like to go inwards and
outwards just so that the curls don't
all go together and become one big wave
and then I like break it apart in the
end and then for the bangs I'm just
curling them to the side
also if you didn't know if you go on
their site and use the coupon code blue
velvet you can get thirty nine dollars
off any wand and if you use the code
jelly bean you can get $100 off any set
so that is amazing
that's an awesome deal and I thought I'd
share it with you guys after I'm done
with that I'm just gonna flip my head
over shake out my hair to get that
volume and then flip it back up and
voila I'm done for the night my hair is
voluminous it's curled and it's ready to
finish off the look I'm using my ila
cosmetics nail polish in mr. cookies and
it's a beautiful color has the cutest
name ever and it's an all organic
natural ingredient nail polish which is
awesome and this is the final look I
