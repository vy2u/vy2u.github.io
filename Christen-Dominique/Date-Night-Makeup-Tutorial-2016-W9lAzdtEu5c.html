today I'm gonna be doing this reverse
smokey I saw this look on Pinterest
immediately was like I have to try this
so I went home tried it I think it's so
easy really liked it because I don't
have to do anything to the top of my
lids sometimes my list can be kind of
crazy they have their good days they
have their bad days and if I don't feel
like wearing color on them you know the
bottom lash line you can get away with
any day any time I think this is a
perfect look for those of you who are
not comfortable with color especially on
your lid or your weird creases you can
do whatever you want to the lower lash
line and you will still look wearable
and you will still feel very comfortable
guys enjoy this look hopefully Cesar
will be taking me on a date with this
look actually we're going to New York
tomorrow so I don't think that's
happening possible I do something how
can you do something just one o'clock
and I'm fine soon if you want to learn
how to get this look then keep watching
so I already did my foundation in my
brows and today I'm just going to jump
into the eyes so what I'm going to do
for the top of the lid is something
super easy it's super easy so what I'm
going to do is take Matt Lin this is
from the bombs meet matrimony palette
which is an all matte palette and how
much okay so I'm taking this shade right
here I'm going to take it with a shader
brush and I'm going to apply it all over
my eyelid and then shake it all the way
up to the brow bone so now that the top
is even the lid is even I'm going to go
ahead and go in with Matt Lopez for the
crease shade here I'm going to blend it
in Matt Lopez with my match 222 brush
and it's just going to give your eyes
the softest definition supernatural it
helps to hold your brush at the end
because you don't have as much control
so it makes you blend a lot smoother and
easier and that is literally all we're
going to do for the top of the lid for
the bottom lash line that's where all
the drama is going to be at and I'm
going to start off with the transition
shade and the transition shade i'm going
in with is chickadee by makeup makeup
geek it's this really pretty mustard
orange shade so i'm going to take my
luck see 239 shading brush and pack on
that shadow focuses on the bottom part
of the lash line
the next shade I'm going to go in with
is from the shade light palette from Kat
Von D this is her rust shade I think
it's beautiful for smoking out your eyes
and it's suitable for all skin types
it's why I really really love this so I
went for the rest shade for the lower
lash line I'm going to go ahead and take
this shade right here
the rustiest looking color in the
palette same shadow brushes of the 213
from Lux E and then I'm going to apply
it right underneath chickadee you still
want to get e to pop through now I'm
just going to take a blending brush just
to smooth out the edges and I'm going to
use this one this is the Smith 235 going
to buff all the edges out and then I'm
going to take the darkest shade in this
palette is brown shade right here my
back to 30 pop it on the bottom lash
line
and then I'm going to take this matte
black shade right here and go across the
lower lash line
I know it looks a little crazy right now
but once we get the eyeliner the lashes
and the just the liner in general it's
going to all tie together and look
really really good so now I'm going to
go ahead and take my eyeliner I'm going
to take my Kat Von D eyeliner I can
finally restock so happen and do my wing
and then I'm going to do my waterline
okay so I just finished with my eyeliner
now I'm going to go ahead and do my
waterline I'm going to use this make it
forever aqua XL I pencil then to smudge
out the eyeliner on the bottom lash line
I'm going to take my morphe m32 six
brush I'm going to smudge it out I'm
going to take some mascara mascara I'm
using is the Marc Jacobs mascara and I
also do my bottom lashes with the Mac
upward lash upward black mascara I'm
going to go off-camera apply some
mascara I'll be back with the lashes the
lashes that I'm going to be using are
from Lily lashes these are the Miami
style
so I'm going to go ahead and start
contouring my cheeks in my nose I'm
going to use fawn this is a single
contour shade from Anastasia and to do
that I'm going to use this NYX zero five
brush for my nose I'm going to use the
highlight diffuser
from Sigma is city 71 I like it because
it's like it's contoured feels like
it'll fit right in there the one with my
mana kadar C 3 and this one 14 luxe face
focus brush from zoeva and I'm going to
work that underneath my eyes and around
the parts of my face that I want
highlighted so I'm going to start right
underneath my eyes and if you went a
little too far down this is the time
where you can go in and blend that out
I'm just going to take this powder from
Tarte this is the confidence creamy
powder foundation and medium natural
this is part of their double duty Beauty
collection and it is full coverage so
for my bronzer I'm going to take this
urban decay beached bronzer and Rong's
this is my current go-to bronzer by the
way that was my stomach
bronzing up the outer part of my face
the outer perimeter of it bring some
warmth to my face this is my Laura
Mercier devotion' face illuminator
warning you your eyes are going to be
blinded by this beautiful thing right
here right isn't it
so gorgeous going to take a little bit
of a lot a lot of that pop it on to the
top of my cheekbone it's a little bit
more glittery than what I would like but
it's still very pretty for my lips I'm
going to do a neutral shade and I'm
going to use drip down from Mac this is
a lip pencil and then it
I feel like this is the exact same color
my lid that crazy this is the crease and
this is the lid no I think I'm just
going to add a little bit of blush the
blush that I love with these lips is
exposed from Tarte it's a matte blush
it's so beautiful it's like the perfect
nudie blush of pink and what am I need
to put it on and take this nudey pink
blush and just pop it on to the apples
of the cheeks I like to keep color
behind the apples of the cheeks because
it looks a lot more natural that way and
especially if you have a smaller face
like mine everything's kind of here
everybody's is kind of here but mind I
feel like is a little bit closer
together so everything has to be further
back so it looks a little more balanced
it's just the perfect nude blush and
this is the completed look it's very
easy and it's just like a no-brainer
whenever you don't want to do too much
on the top of your lid so I suggest you

turns out for you tag me on instagram
