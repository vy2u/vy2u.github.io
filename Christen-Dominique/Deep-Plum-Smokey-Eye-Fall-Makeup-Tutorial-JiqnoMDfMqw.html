my eyes are running I should be running
today we're going to be doing this look
right here it's very dramatic I feel
like I needed a dramatic look in my life
lately I've been very natural or
barefaced a lot of the days so this
dramatic look needed to happen I love
this look smoky and it's perfect for the
holiday parties if you're having any
holiday parties coming up it looks
amazing on anybody's eyes makes
everyone's eyes pop so I hope you guys
enjoy the video let's get to it
so before I apply my foundation I'm
going to use this figs in Rouge primer
this is the mattifying emulsion and pore
refiner it's going to give you a sheer
matte coverage and it's good for shine
control and also minimize your minimizes
your pores so big plus for me so I
couldn't obviously wait for you guys I
had to do my tribal marks before I
caught on camera already on my
foundation marked out where I want it
and I'm using me Make Up For Ever HD
stick it's just super easy you just
stripe it on everywhere and then blend
it out so easy I'm going to get my
beauty blender and blend it out I've
never been as broken out as I've been
lately like I have marks all over my
face I don't know what's going on I
don't know so I'm just going to put on a
light foundation first because I'm going
to go straight into the eyes and then go
back to the face later we are going to
use heavier eye makeup today so that's
why I'm starting with the eyes first and
my hair has been very dry I color it so
much that I always have to use masks I
got a new mask in my Ipsy glam bag this
beautiful bag right here isn't it so
cool it's like galaxy inspired I got
this Novak's haircare extreme deep hair
care creams restores the shine and the
smoothness and deep conditions your hair
so now I'm going to do my eyebrows I'm
going to take this super thin liner
brush from inspire beauty I like this
brush because you can get really precise
with a type of brow that you want you
can really get into those
sparse areas and just pack on the color
right precisely where you want it I I
lost my brush like I can't find any of
my brow brushes so when I got this I was
like yes finally I have a brow brush
slash eyeliner because you know I don't
use them for for gel eyeliners I don't
know why I just it's not something that
I like doing so if I ever have a really
thin angled brush like this
automatically I think brows so I just
finished my brows I filled them in a
little bit with this brow bar to go this
is in brunette I think medium to ebony
now I'm going to go ahead and do my eye
shadow so I'm going to first put down a
primer this is the Jessie's Girl I
shadow primer right here and this is
going to help my color last all the
colors that I'm going to put on my eyes
today it's going to help them last and
we look more vivid so I'm taking this
frappe makeup geek eyeshadow and I'm
going to work that into my crease I'm
going to blend it pretty good using
circular windshield wiper motions and
I'm gonna hollow out that crease area
and then I'm gonna take it down to the
lower lash line using a smaller dense
brush next I am going to use this
eggplant shade right here this is from
luck see beauty it's a matte eyeshadow
pan this is in number 290 and it's
highly pigmented if you don't want a
bunch of eyeshadow on your eyes use a
very light hand and go from there
but I'm going to use a bunch of
eyeshadow on my eyes so I'm going to
take a bunch of that on my fluffy brush
and just going to blend it on the lid
going all the way up to the crease also
on the lower part of the lash line and
I'm just gonna fade it out a whole bunch
but I do still want frappe to peek
through and I also want it to be very
vibrant on my lower inner part of my
lashes so I'm going to go ahead and go
back in with frappe right there it is
gonna look like you got punched in the
eye a whole bunch of times it just look
like honestly I was like okay am i
filming a vampire video right now what
is this but trust me after you're done
it's gonna look amazing this smokey
beautiful purple golden brown eye shadow
is just going to look amazing but at
first
it does look like about two black eyes
it's okay we'll work through it so next
I'm taking the star of the show for this
look this is the color pop super shocked
I shadow in stereo it's a beautiful
burgundy brown with plum glitter in it
almost like plum ego red kind of glitter
in it kind of like my background
that's the glitter it has in it and it's
so beautiful I love this eye shadow it
glides on with intense pigmentation and
there's no fallout so that's why I love
this thing and it is literally heaven
it's singing on my eyes right now it's
so vibrant and beautiful and I'm just
going to apply that to my lid so next
I'm creating this thick wing liner to do
that I'm using the absolute New York
Nano liner in black and it's an ultra
fine liner so that you can get really
precise with it and I'm just gonna pack
it on make it as thick as possible and
then make sure that wing is super sharp
I want my eye makeup to be super
dramatic today so what I'm going to do
is take some eyeliner a really good one
one of my favorite liners for the
waterline is the tarte liner it is
intense and bold and it goes on very
creamy so I'm putting it on to the
waterline and even underneath the
waterline and then I'm going to smudge
it out a whole bunch since when we
really smoky smudgy right on the lower
lash line now I'm going to take some
mascara this is a Lancome mascara and
I'm gonna apply some to the top and
bottom lashes just to prep them for
eyelashes so I just put a little mascara
on and I'm gonna put some lashes on
these have been my favorite lashes the
Lilly ghalichi ones are amazing they are
so natural but they have like a dramatic
effect to them so it's like natural but
dramatic somehow I don't know I love
what these are the Paris style the Miami
style are really nice too and I like
that the band is really thin so it's not
like you can see a big thick strip on
your eye so it looks really natural and
these are the Paris style okay so I just
found the lashes
and they're very wispy and
natural-looking um my eye is starting to
cry so no matter what I put right there
it's not going to stick which sucks but
we'll work with it I'm going to brighten
up my inner corners so I'm going to use
this um star powder I think it is
diamond powder from makeup forever yeah
somebody is a little bit of that in my
inner corner something the brush a
little bit I'm going to do a cream
contour today I'm using the Make Up For
Ever HD stick but just a darker
foundation color so I'm just going to go
ahead and go in the usual spots to kind
of make them a little bit more Hollow
and structured that's around the
cheekbones down the sides of the nose
around the temples and of course of the
double chin and then I'm going to take
my Beauty Blender just to blend
everything out so it's nice and even and
it's not too harsh I don't know what it
is about highlighting my under eyes it
never gets old
I feel like when I get to this point I
get really excited I feel like I can
conquer the world when my under eyes are
on fleek
I just feel super extra freaky once I
finish highlighting my under eyes thumbs
up if you feel me today I'm using a
liquid highlight this one is from jelly
pong pong it's their liquid gossamer
highlight in ethereal and it's water
based very lightweight and super
luminizing pop this on to the tops of
the cheekbones and the tip of the nose
or the cheeks I'm using the makeup geek
blush and infatuated I obviously have
been infatuated with this blush because
I've been using it a ton lately in my
videos it's just something that it's
like a bronzy peachy blush so it just
goes with everything
recently for me so sorry I've been using
it a lot I just love it way too much for
the lip liner I'm using the colour-pop
lippie stick in oh snap and it's such a
beautiful mauve a pink color I'm going
to apply that to my lips I'm going to
try to go a little bit above but not too
much not too crazy um just to make them
look even in a little bit fuller on the
edges because I feel like my my lips are
super thin on me on the very end and to
top
the lip color I'm applying a nudey pink
one this is from colour-pop it's in vice
and it's their liquid matte lipstick so
I'm pretty much done but before I go I
want to let you know what I have on my
nails I have this nail polish from
dermelect on it's a peptide infused
lacquer in the color commando kind of
like a terracotta color and what I like
is that it strengthens weak brittle
nails and know that I get gels often so
I decided to take a break and put this
guy on this is the final look I hope you
