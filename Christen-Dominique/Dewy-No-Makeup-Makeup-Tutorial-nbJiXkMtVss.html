this robe right now like the dorky
version you got groomed yesterday so
she's nice and pretty and I think she
knows it mm-hmm
Starbucks for breakfast don't mind if I
do one Saturday morning hey guys welcome
back to my channel so today I'm gonna be
filming this makeup look right here it's
Saturday morning so I feel like I'm not
gonna really do much today I'm not doing
any crazy big event or anything probably
go to the movies go out to eat or
something
I just want my skin to look really nice
and healthy if you want to learn how to
get this glowy dewy skin look very
natural just really enhancing your
natural features then keep watching
I literally just woke up and it's like
early in the morning so I still have
things weird things going on in my
eyeballs so just putting it out there
for you guys I just want my skin to look
really good and I want to like look very
natural and just like a better version
of myself so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
use this priming water from Smashbox
it's a photo finished priming water just
to hydrate my skin I'm gonna hold it a
little further away every time I spray
something in my face always go and I
hold it it's so weird my focus today is
for my skin to look very healthy dewy
and glowing so I'm going to take cover
this cover FX custom cover drops and I'm
going to mix it with this Becca
backlight priming filter so I'm just
going to take both of them on my hand
like that and I'm going to mix in some
of this priming filter just to give our
skin a little glow
here we have both of these guys on my
hand I'm just gonna mix them up with my
beauty blender mix them together and
then work it onto my skin wow that's
pretty good coverage make sure you get
your neck so everything is your neck
isn't detached from your body that's
like what are the most important things
for me I'm like let me get my neck
really quick so that it looks like one
piece and just bounce my beauty blender
into my skin I like the the back was it
clogged the Becca backlight priming
filter I like this because it gives your
skin like a very subtle glow it's not an
intense shimmer all over your face which
is what I thought it would be when I
first got it but it's really nice
actually next I'm going to do my brows I
have been using this brow brush lately
it's called it's from blink and these
guys are in Sephora I believe on the end
of the brush is so narrow it works
really good at getting precise lines on
your eyebrows making those hair like
strokes it's like one of the best brow
brushes I've used so far so I'm kind of
stuck on it and I really like the
spoolie it has like tiny little bristles
it's really hard to find a really good
spoolie because I feel like most brands
don't really care too much about this
spoolie there's big gaps in between and
they're just fluffy that is nothing to
brush through your brows
this one is like really short bristles
and they're close together so it
literally grabs each hair and it like
combs right through them so it gives you
a really nice brushed up look so I'm
going to go ahead and fill my brows I've
been using the brow Zing's lately from
benefit I'm using number six and number
four mixed together I like to start
right in this area so go straight across
getting in to the eyes I'm going to use
the violet Voss pro-rider dye palette
this is like really really huge palette
it's something you can use every single
day realize so I grabbed it and I was
like okay I'm gonna use like two colors
I always like to set my eyelids with the
neutral color shadow and then I'll go
back in with a crease color to add some
dimension back into the eye so I'm just
gonna take April because April looks
like she's pretty skin tone looking a
pop it all over my eyelids in the mirror
oh my god
huge huge mirror you see yourself do you
you see your so oh my God look how many
of me is there is whoa that's trippy
that's trippy my god you see that this
is the m5 21 and I'm gonna pop that all
over my lid take it all the way up to
the brow bone and if you don't have like
an eye shadow that's your color or close
to your skin color just use your powder
that works too we're just trying to
neutralize and set everything on the lid
and then I'm going to take a crease a
crease brush this is the M 507 the first
color that pops out for my crease is
Abigail I feel like this is a really
nice matte topee shade work it through
through the crease and we just want to
add a soft nice soft dimension to the
the crease this brush is from the makeup
Shack it's in number t12
it's a fuller fluffier brush softening
up the edges and just kind of washing
the color through the crease I want to
add a little bit more of appreciate so
I'm going to take Josie just focusing on
the outer part of the crease and then
I'm going to work it through with that
makeup shock brush just just soften up
the shadow so that's basically all I
wanted to do to my eyes just make them
look like a healthy natural looking eye
okay and then for my concealer today I'm
going
is the NARS radiant creamy concealer
this is in Canal and work that
underneath my eyes just to cover up
those dark circles I feel like the
radiant creamy concealer is a little bit
more lightweight and it gives you that
luminous radiant look so I'm
highlighting my face right now this is
giving us like a base highlight at the
same time we're concealing our under
eyes blend that in with my Beauty
Blender I'm actually going to go around
my mouth because it tends to be really
dark right here
lightly putting the beauty blender to
blend it out because when you use
lighter like a lighter hand to bounce it
it just blends a little bit easier and
it still leaves the coverage that you
want I feel like if you bounce too hard
it picks up a lot of the product which
is good if you have too much but if you
really want that coverage you want to
use very light patting motion I'm going
to go in with this uh Nastasia cream
contour palette bringing back the
dimension in my face these we use a lot
of foundation and concealer that can
kind of just make us look washed out so
for that I'm going to use two shades
right here going in with my Sigma angled
cream contour brush I'm going to take it
right down my nose closer your contour
is the smaller your nose is going to
look so I like to make it a little bit
more narrow towards the end look a
little bit more pinched in and then I'll
do these little this little triangle
shape right on it
I'm going to go in with the Stila kitten
hue highlighter illuminator I like it
because it's a cream and it's going to
make your skin look like skin so I'm
going to go ahead and highlight on the
center of my my lids nose Cupid's bow
chin and then I'm going to go in with
the ciate dewey stick right here and
this is going to give your skin
beautiful dewy healthy look so i'm gonna
go in with this it makes your skin kind
of give you that wet look it's really
really pretty
I actually did a photo shoot with them
me and a few other girls we did a photo
shoot with the CIT dewy sticks it was so
fun there was a photographer there named
Sasha and she did Kylie's pictures so
she did our pictures it was really cool
and we got to create this cool video I'm
gonna be posting it on Instagram soon so
you'll get to see the pictures that
Sasha actually took and the video from
the shoot that we did it's so cool
everything's like very like natural
glowing and just really beautiful and
I'm going to take it on my finger you
can apply it right onto your skin but
I'm going to take it on my finger and
I'm going to go over those highlighted
areas and you'll see that everything is
going to be amplified this is in the
shade glow oh my goodness look at it
it's beautiful took your skin is glowing
and it's doing it's healthy and I love
it so I'm gonna put it right on the
parts that I want and highlighted that's
going to give us that glowing dewy wet
healthy look can't even put this on your
eyelids to give your eyelids that wet
look it's also good for like a beach day
like beachy hair and your skin is just
like supple looking and glowing and
healthy and dewy
oh so so so good I'm going to take this
mascara right here I'm in excessive lash
from makeup forever and just coat my
lashes really good before I pop on the
fake lash the false lashes
and just start at the base and just
wiggle your way up
I like this mascara because it's not
super wet it's kind of dry so it really
grabs on to your lashes so now my lashes
are there they're saying hi to everybody
I'm going to go in with these Lily
lashes these are super natural looking
but they're really really pretty they're
in the style goddess look like this
they're so so pretty and very wispy and
natural-looking I'm gonna put these on
really quickly thank you starbuck yes
did you get it SOI did you get this so
am sematic egg for the cheeks I'm going
to take this steal AB glow watercolor
blush and it's in the shade rosewater
looks like this on the inside looks like
that so I'm just going to pop that onto
my cheeks just a few little dots I feel
like my lips are really dry so I'm going
