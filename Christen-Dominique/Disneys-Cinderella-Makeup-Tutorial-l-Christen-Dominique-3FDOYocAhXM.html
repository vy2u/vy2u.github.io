Cinderella I'm using the Kat Von D
locket tattoo foundation and I got this
foundation especially for this video
because Cinderella is a cartoon and
she's perfect and flawless so I wanted
to get as close as I could to her skin
and this foundation is completely full
coverage as you can see it took out my
brow color so it works pretty good and
then I went in with my NARS concealer in
custard and just lightened up my under
eyes
Cinderella's brows have a thin rounded
shape so I'm going to take my cargo
tinted wax and round off my brows as
much as I can but still fill in those
sparse areas and also I'm definitely
going a lot thinner than what I'm used
to for my brows but it definitely has
that cartoon effect so try to go as thin
as you can if you have a little bit of a
thickness on the tail just pin it off
with a clean brush and then I'm going to
go in with my Eiko brow gel just to set
my brows in place I tend to have a
little bit of a boo boo brow syndrome so
I'm just trying to fix that and then
with makeup geek speech smoothie I'm
using this as a base and I'm going to go
from the lid all the way to the brow
bone just so that you have a nice smooth
even base
make sure that we look super cartoon
flawless I'm going to get the Urban
Decay powder foundation and it's going
to lock everything in and also add
another layer of coverage
now I'm taking the Sigma final touch
inner rim liner and it's a milky pink
liner and it's gonna make our eyes
really pop and give us that doughy eyed
princess look to add soft depth to the
eyes I'm going to take the stroke of
midnight palette using this color here
this is Omega
and I'm going to apply this to my lower
lash line and also on the crease
so now I'm going to take this Mabi color
here and I'm going to place it right on
the crease and then I'm going to blend
it upwards towards the brow bone
just to make sure there isn't any harsh
lines I'm taking a big fluffy brush and
blending the edges
now I'm taking this peachy pink color
here this is vapor and I'm going to use
a smudger brush just to lightly dust
this on to the inner corners now I'm
going to create a small delicate wing
and I usually like to start outwards and
create the flick and then work my way
inwards and I'm going to elongate
through inge a bit past where the eye
naturally stops and this is going to
give us a really nice pretty lifted look
so now I'm going to take the Studio Fix
lash mascara from the Cinderella
collection and I'm just going to apply a
few coats to the top and bottom lashes
where the lashes I wanted something that
was really fluttery and whimsical for
the outer corner and these were perfect
these are the miss glam Beauty lashes in
full-on glam and I like to usually start
right on the center and then attach one
side at a time
now I'm going to do a soft contour to do
that I'm using the Too Faced chocolate
so wheel matte bronzer and I'm just
lightly defining my face right along the
cheekbones and the nose just to
straighten it out and kind of make it
look a little bit thinner at the end
because Cinderella has a tiny little
nose
for a light flush of color on the cheeks
and taking tarts celebrated blush and
I'm going from the tops of my cheekbones
all the way in towards the outer part of
my nose to give us a more cartoon
looking effect to get that glowing
princess effect on your face I am taking
my mary-lou manizer which is currently
my favorite highlighter and placing it
right on the tops of my cheekbones the
tip of my nose in the center of the
brows to give us a dipping effect and
right on the Cupid's bow for the lips
I'm going to define them with the aqua
lips by makeup forever this is in the
color c3 I believe I don't know I'm not
too sure but I'll have it all listed
below for you guys and then I'm going to
apply my Gerard cosmetics nude lipstick
this is an orange e nude and then
because it's kind of two oranges for me
I'm going to go right over the top of it
with godmother which is a really pretty
piece and this is the finished look I
love how fresh glowing and doughy eyed
this look is anybody can wear this and
look absolutely amazing I love you guys
so much and I had so much fun doing this
video this is the end of the video I
hope you guys enjoyed it it was super
fun for me to make I love Disney and
Cinderella and I'm super excited for the
