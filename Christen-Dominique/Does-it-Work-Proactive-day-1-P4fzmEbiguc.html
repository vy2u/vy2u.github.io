can't replace you are you are hi today's
my first skincare video this first video
in this category of skincare and we're
going to be using Proactiv we're going
to try that out and see if it works
this is for everyone who has breakouts
and blemishes or you maybe just want to
know how proactive works or if it works
we're going to do it together and here's
going to be dating one just got off from
work not too long ago this is how
actually I wear my makeup during the day
it's just powder and like filled in my
brows and I get some mascara on and some
bottom liner so now we're going to get
into washing our face
I'm sorry cleanser she sings alone so
we're going to get tonight
Wow
oh Jesus hi wash off first step way to
take a white towel because it use a
colored towel it will boot your towels
so I'm just going to Pat my skin dry now
I'm going to take the second step which
gives me revival I turn over my face is
cotton ball and I'm going to show you
the redness that I have looks really
aggravated right now so far it feels and
it burns a little bit so after that's
done going to do step three which is the
parent treatment and ecolution is this
is the special lotion because it has
benzoyl peroxide packaging in the ocean
so yeah this is an important part all
right so we're almost going to put that
if we look at just look at them Blair
and we try wrong I'm going to launch it
a green tea moisturizer just because it
is like the most soothing for your face
face and this feels like silk on me on
my face
puts the soup and it smells still kind
of medical smelling wet it's
um it does make your skin feel really
smooth even have this layer of silk on
your face hey Vern that's what I can
save up it should spit burns there is a
clarifying night cream that I want to
come on as well because it helps to
clear pores and acne blemishes my face
is working is more than what it was a
few minutes a few seconds really hoping
it all kind of settle down and cheeks
you to be really breaking up yeah this
actually smells pretty good like
cucumbers okay so I hate for you guys to
see me without makeup this is kind of an
experience for both of us because I'm a
lecture I'm going to have under-eye
circles to everybody but I do that's my
face day one and we'll see how it work
you guys know my face books without any
makeup and I was wearing the plate
bareMinerals powders from covers really
well it's like so good I love this
makeup it is too dark for me to golden
tan but I'm getting some lighter colors
in to see which one gives my skin color
match so you can blend it into your skin
it just looks great um and it covers
100% as you often see I don't think you
saw any of these marks on my face really
too much but I bet you wanna see it all
so I'm here naked face for you and for
me to see like if this works and then if
not I have some other stuff that we can
try but would you Proactiv for now trial
and error
anyways that was it that was my skincare
routine for today I'm going to try to
follow up with each other every week
