smell I can't replace you are you are
hey yeah so it's Kristin and I've used
Proactiv for one full week do you have
the bareMinerals
powder foundation on and it is very full
coverage so obviously I'm covering all
the little imperfections but I think
it's been working very well the only
complaint I have about the Proactiv that
not only does it burn but it really
dries my skin out to the point to where
I touch my face and I'm like oh my god
like just touching my face makes it feel
like it has more moisture which I know
you're not supposed to touch your hands
with your face your face with your hands
but I have been doing that because my
face is really dry and I've been using a
first to give you that repairing
treatment that has been sulfur oxide in
it and acne treatment and it is a lotion
but it is very very nice so right after
that I've been using the green tea
moisturizer and you can look at my first
skincare video day one and I'll do the
whole process like I'll show you what
everything on and everything so I've
been using this every day after the
third step it's supposed to soothe and
calm dry skin but I could feel like it
made it drier I don't know if because
right after that I would put on this
Bare Minerals and it's powdery so it
like makes it feel even more dry we
really draw I mean I just had to grab my
lizard pose to put lotion on your face
Christian use face cream but I grab this
and just put it all over my face I got a
desperate because my skin was that dry
so like
gather though my faith but it was
throwing up my pimples now this is not a
video about minerals but I'm kind of all
like comes together somehow because I
put it on right afterward and this is
all I'm wearing on my face I really like
the coverage and I cannot stop using
this thing I think I'm allergic to it
because I just put it on just to touch
up for you guys right out on a why if I
don't take it off anyways it's like you
know when you get like like a mosquito
bite and it has like a little whelp on
it and it kind of inches that's what
happened to you when I wear this but
it's not like all over the place it's
like I just got right here um I just got
one right here and right here
adds that advanced varnish cream I'm
haven't even opened it yet
and I'm going to try it because I do
have a hard-to-reach spot that is just
there and it kind of gets dried out but
I can make it back over it kind of feels
like it itches or swells up a little bit
and just feel like itching it just feels
like a really bad mosquito bite so I
think it's an allergic reaction to
something I'm thinking very minerals I'm
not really too sure but I hate to say
that because I love it and I'm only
gonna keep using it because it's so good
you know no other part of my face is
breaking out like balance in the studio
is biting
so basically what I'm going to do right
now for you is take off my makeup easily
like a sponge and wipe
so using these guys I'm going to use the
camera like my hair is sitting over
there because the angle and stuff it
just too much we like doing that right
now all this would be right there we go
oh maybe imma have to take off all my my
book or you can see it is full coverage
guys it looked like I just caked it on
but when you see me in person look at
all of that like that's how good that
foundation is is full coverage you can
see like all the red spots have like a
lot of red spots I have dry to
combination skin if you have dry skin
and using this product you may need to
use another formula that is very
hydrating because it's very dry just in
out really bad and it dried my skin out
really bad so I mean everybody a
different skin type I'm showing you my
kind of skin and hopefully you get
something from it that you it may work
differently for you guys you just have
to try it out ourselves and that's why I
want to do Owens up Eric also want to
watch me anymore
hello now that all my makeup is off blah
this is my skin now a week later using
it every day and every night so what do
you guys think just let me know in the
comments below it
as cleared up or stayed the same
something there and this is just my
other side of my face and these are not
really this is just my skin I think I
just have broken blood vessels right
