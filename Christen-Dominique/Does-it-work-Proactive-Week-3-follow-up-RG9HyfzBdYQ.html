skincare update today we are going to
talk about number three this is the
third week I didn't do a video last week
just because I felt like it was pretty
much the same kind of deal um I had dry
skin it was drying everything out I did
get two blemishes two new blemishes um
they went away in two days after I lose
this advanced blemish treatment I put it
on that night in the morning when I woke
up it was pretty much almost gone in the
next day it was completely gone and you
actually can see it very clearly in my
last makeup tutorial you can we'll get
back I'll link it somewhere in here of
shim bar this actually works very very
well
so getting little breakouts here and
there nothing really major it's not
getting any worse better but I'm still
doing a little white breakout to in
there yes can I do my video nice and
private
yes it's so funny because I can talk to
you guys here and I'm fine or whatever
but then somebody comes in and I'm just
like I guess I'm shy
I don't know it's weird because I know
this is going to be seen by several
people and one person just be in the
room kind of like shuts me down but
anyways
on the hunt for a moisturizer because
last time we talked I told you it was
like really driving my skin out and I
was in lotion on my face which was
totally wrong sorry I liked some of the
comments and I know we're not using the
illusion on our faces I will not do that
after reading a lot of your comments and
I have a co-worker who suggested
in-clinic moisturizer that was really
really good and super hydrating kind of
like using the lotion on my face but
it's for your face so it won't clog
report
so she gave me a sample of it it's this
Clinique Moisture Surge and I didn't
really like it too much at first it felt
really really good and silky kind of
like the green tea moisturizer that
Proctor has made it even more dry so I
couldn't do it afterwards it was like I
have this on and this on so it was just
like dry city like I felt like I was
born
wrinkles in five minutes it was a 508
wrinkle back cuz I found I found the
cure to this super super dry face
syndrome
so what I realized and I had this
actually of when I got my Proactiv stuff
in I got my bare minerals products in
from bare minerals they nicely sent them
to me for my channel and they sent me
this purely nourishing moisturizer for
combination skin
bang well it cure my dry skin issues
immediately and I've had this the whole
time I'm like this isn't gonna work I
tried it because you never know until
you tried armed and super super
moisturizing and it smells like I'm at a
spa that's the only way I can describe
it it just smells spot light but if you
want to get something that's going to
hydrate your skin or if you're using
Proactiv like I am and having a little
bit of that issue then try it and I
don't know why I don't know if I have to
come to terms with how my skin my face
is in my head I feel that if I use the
acne products like proactive and things
like that that it's going to take away
this scar in here um I think I have to
just come to terms that their scars and
they're not going to go away which
really really it just
really sucks I don't know if anything
guys deal with that look at this side
and you're doing the scarring and when
you look at this irons like that's
always going to be there soon right I
mean this is a wooden guy's thing is
this just blemishes or is it scarring
can you read scars ever come closer to
your skin color again I don't know if
you guys know let me know it is it's not
how much concerns are pressed about it
but it does really really suck to have
to rely on using a makeup to hide that
tell me what you think about scarf the
face or maybe you have scars and you're
red and founder of your skin color I
just want to look and feel good without
the foundation yeah and just don't want
any more reps cards we're going to take
off the foundation so we can see what
our update is wired
as you can tell I am learning we're
going to get this together I am going to
try this but it says leave on for 10
minutes yeah I'm going to have to leave
it on and come back boots put it on
together I'll turn this way for it you
can see my whole setup in the restroom
this is my setup so and we're going to
put it on our face
oh so good for my skin is burning right
now but this is pretty thick
is this where you're supposed to put it
on apply to damn skin already doing it
we're all into the little water
basically this is what it looks like
after it has been dried and it's just
like any other mask very tight feeling
on all of that good stuff and we're
gonna wash it off I'm going to tell you
how it feels
my skin feels really moisturized I know
I look really red and kind of irritated
right now
but I'm gonna put on this bareMinerals
so now we are ready to go to bed or go
on with our night and you need to wash
my hair that's too much information I am
done with my skin care update and my
phone like this video if you wanna keep
seeing videos like this I go by your
life in my review so that's how I kind
of way out what I'm going to do so if
you don't want to miss a skin care
update video subscribe to my channel and
we'll see each other in the next video
bye
sneaking out at night living like for
free you and I can do anything we please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
