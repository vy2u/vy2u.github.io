so today I'm going to be doing this
matte brown smokey eye I actually tried
this over the weekend just playing
around with my makeup and I really liked
how it came out so I wanted to do it for
you guys and if you want to learn how to
get the look then keep watching first oh
I'm going to try this little guy out
it's from benefit it's called puff off
and it's super adorable
I'm going to use this underneath my eyes
it's so cute it looks like a little iron
this is supposed to help with deep
puffing your under eyes if it has a
little bit of a brightener in it too
because it kind of brightened up my
under-eye area a little bit for my
foundation I'm using the cover FX
foundation just going to apply that with
my gloomier foundation brush
I did a self tanner so I didn't realize
how much how much darker my face my body
is for my face so excuse excuse the UM
mismatch if it's kind of totally
opposite but I'm going to blend it into
my neck as much as I can and now I know
that I need a darker foundation for the
concealer I'm going to use my Smashbox
high definition concealer in fair light
I haven't been able to find this little
guy and like 5 what num exaggerating
like 2 to 3 months and it's been really
sad so when I found this in my little
when I found this in my son's backpack I
got really excited we we took him to
Disney Legoland and I packed some of my
stuff in his backpack that's why it fell
out the other day and I was so excited
coverage on this is really good it's
very lightweight it just blends into
your skin so nice
I also kind of go over the broken
capillaries around my nose it tends to
be really red around there so I make
sure to get that area all right so now
we're going to do the eye shadow the
smokey eyes so the first color I'm going
to pick up is from the semi-sweet
chocolate bar palette and it's going to
be peanut butter that's going to be our
transition color
the next color I'm picking up is from
the chocolate bar palette and it's they
don't have names I'm just going to pick
up this color right here and I'm going
to apply it all over my lid hi guys I
wanted to introduce my new voice I'm
editing I'm editing this on a different
day than when I filmed and I just so
happened to catch something and now I
sound like a frog but anyways back to
the makeup I'm picking up a cherry
cordial and I'm gonna pop this on my lid
blending it upwards towards my crease
so next I'm going to pick up triple
fudge which is this in deep dark brown
matte color and I'm going to focus this
just on the lower part of the lid and
once I have the amount that I want then
I'm going to blend it upwards towards
the crease
pics I'm picking up coconut cream from
the semi-sweet palate and I may use this
as a highlight on my brow bone and then
also blended around the outer part of
the shadow just to soften the edges
I'm going to go back into cherry cordial
in line my lower lashline
I'm going to take my Urban Decay all
nighter eyeliner and line up my
waterline so that it's nice and dark
so next I'm picking up TARDIS which is
the clay paint liner from Tarte and I
started applying this with my Tarte
ankles liner brush then I switched over
to those that we've a angled liner brush
because it's just easier for me to work
with and now I'm gonna sharpen up my
wing with a clean concealer brush
next and I coat my lashes with mascara
I'm using the Vincent Longo mascara and
it is one of my faves because it doesn't
clump it lengthens my lashes and it's a
dry formula so after it dries you can go
back over it and it kind of lifts your
lashes up and makes them look fuller
these are perfect lashes from foxy locks
they're currently my favorite lashes
they're natural that they still add some
drama
so now I'm going to apply my powder I'm
using the Smashbox powder and apply that
all over my face is to lock my
foundation in next I'm going to pick up
the AH Nastasia pink powder and yes it's
hit pan into even rock bottom everyday
and I'm going to add more coverage to my
under eyes and brighten them and also
add this on my tops of my cheekbones as
a highlight for the contour and picking
up this color here from the city color
contour effects palette and just
chiseling out my cheekbones
and I'm going from that highlight today
so I'm going to use the same pink powder
wheezed earlier and I'm gonna highlight
the bridge of my nose and the center of
my forehead for the blush I'm using the
city color be matte blush in fresh mouth
for the lips I'm using this NYX lip
liner in citrus and this is the only
color I'm gonna use on my lips so I'm
going to outline them and then fill them
in after I'm done
I just apply a lip balm and lovely hi
