today I'm going to be showing you how to
get this vampy Valentine's makeup look
perfect for Valentine's Day or you know
late night date night I just got my
Kylie Valentines collection in and I
used the eyes the lips and the cheeks I
really like how it came out very simple
it's really easy actually I didn't use
too many different colors and so if you
want to learn how to get it and if you
like this look then keep watching don't
forget to subscribe to my channel and
hit that notification bow so you can be
a part of the notification quad yes I
said Kwan if you say squad that's not
how you say it if you want to learn how
to get this look and then keep watching
oh my god you guys my throat is on fire
I have been sick for the past like week
and I am getting better actually my body
is is not as a ki and feverish anymore
it's more just my throat I feel like
having this voice gives me a different
personality and I kind of like it I'm
gonna quickly put on my primer
foundation all that stuff so I'm going
to be using the Urban Decay urban
defense complexion primer it looks like
so looks cool against this background
huh I promise you guys I have a hair
there's a little ball up there somewhere
okay so if I'm going on a Valentine's
Day and I want to look like super high
or on my anniversary I want my skin to
look like there is not one single pore
on my face
it is very full coverage it's quick it's
easy so I'm gonna first just put some
marks down on my face this or actually I
make these little three lines every time
I put it on
so that's what we're gonna do I don't
know why I did that blend that in with
my Beauty Blender all right so now I'm
gonna put on this sja Lauder Double Wear
I know it's a lot of cake but I love the
cake so I'm gonna put this down on my
hand so I'm gonna take some of this and
focus it on the areas where I really
need it everywhere you see you can kind
of you can still see my under-eye
circles that's just because I'm not
focusing my foundation there too much
because then it's going to look really
cakey underneath the eyes we're going to
go in with chart shape tape which is
extremely full coverage so we don't need
as much around that area you know what I
need to get this in a darker shade is
this would be a really good contouring
stick just because the way it's shaped
right here I'm gonna give me a darker
shade so I'm gonna do my brows
off-camera and I will be back with the
eye shadow I'm going to be using the
Kylie collection but she doesn't have
like a matte yellow bone color shade so
what I'm gonna do is use my um
somebody's my Kat Von D palette I'm
going to take this shade right here and
I'm gonna pop that all over my lid and
this is a morphe M five to four brush
when you want it all over cut all over
lid color it just fits on the lid so
perfectly and gets everything on there
really quick and easy I'm gonna take
this morphe m57 5 brush and I'm going to
grab some of this shade right here from
the this little palette right here and
I'm going to take main squeeze let me
take this shade and I'm gonna work it on
the crease
this is from the little smooch palette
take it on my m 506 brush for more feet
start to work it on the outer part of
the lid up into the crease outer part of
the crease I'm just going to go in like
a v-shape back and forth right here and
I'm just going to keep building up the
intensity as I go and creating that V if
you want it to be really sharp you can
get some tape and put it right under
there and be perfectly sharp but I'm
gonna I'm gonna leave it just how it is
sweep it back and forth okay there's
this really deep burgundy shade in the
Kylie's Diary palette I am gonna take it
because I have to dip my brush in there
so it's this one right here it's called
loves me nods and so I'm going to take
it on my on that same War thief and 506
brush and I'm going to pop it right on
top just to make it a little bit more of
a deep burgundy shade okay and then in
the crease I'm going to take this shade
right here this gray shade called Hart
eyes it has like a purple undertone it's
like a really pretty greyish purple and
I'm going to take that right above into
the crease I'm going to take a poison
berry which is the shade right here I'm
going to use that for the inner corners
this is such a pretty highlight color I
like that it has like a pink undertone
to it so now I'm going to do my eyeliner
I'm going to do a nice cat eye I'm going
to take this tart liner been using it a
lot lately just because it's super dark
black and I'm going to take the liquid
liner side and create a wing just gonna
coat my lashes with some mascara ah
we're gonna put shadow right on the lash
line but I'm going to do that later once
I've already set my face with powder
right now I'm just gonna go ahead and
pop on some lashes some super glam
lashes let's see what I can find
so I'm gonna take these right here these
are the Lila mink lashes from Lily
lashes they look like this oh that's
creepy I actually turned off the camera
and I was gonna do my my lashes but stop
it Cesar so I'm gonna go ahead and well
I'm putting some lash glue on my lashes
I don't want to let them sit for a
little bit and while I do that I'm going
to contour and do my concealer and stuff
so I'm going to go ahead and put some
concealer on
I like to bring the concealer up along
the side of my nose because it helps
make the nose look a little bit more
narrow okay so now I'm just going to set
my powders in place I'm using I've been
using this one for the past few
tutorials but I just I really like it
it's the photo bomb from the balm and
light medium it's going to set my cranes
in place so they move around this I'm
taking the Kat Von D white you get that
yellow and beige powder and I'm gonna
put it right underneath my under-eye
circles I'm going to take some of Kat
Von D could I show you guys this palette
I'm using these two shades right here to
contour my cheekbones and my nose so I'm
going to go right under that cheekbone
just cut it flip my brush over no get up
okay so now I'm going to work on the
lower lash line I'm going to go ahead
and take this brush this is the luck
c-141 mini round brush and I'm going to
take that color in smooch this is called
in love I'll work it on the bottom lash
line and then for the bottom lash line
I'm just going to put on some pencil
liner this super black one from Tarte
I'm just going to go halfway I'm going
to bring it up into underneath the lash
line on top and yeah I'm going to put
some mascara on my bottom lashes and
because that's not very exciting I'm
going to do that off camera and I will
be back with the rest of the face hits
I'm going to go ahead and bronze up my
skin a little bit I'm going to be using
the knot a little bit we're just going
to bronze it up I'm gonna be using the
Bom Bom Beach and take my japonesque
brush swirl it around and just have some
color to my cheeks for some reason this
bronzer is giving me Valentine's bronzy
vibes I think it has like a pink
undertone to it but um it just reminded
me of Valentine's so I'm just warming up
my cheeks taking it around my temples
around the forehead cheekbones for the
blush I'm gonna go ahead and take the
one from the Kylie's diary blush this
peach one right here and I like to work
that back into the hairline I'm actually
mixing a little bit of that pink blush
in with this peach one to give this skin
like a really nice glow now I'm going to
move on to the lips I'm going to use
this lip kit right here the head over
heels and comes with the lip liner and a
lipstick I feel like it matches our eye
look really nice so I'm gonna use it so
first I'm going to line my lips with the
head over here is a little
head-over-heels liner I do have to say
these liners are super soft and I'm
going to take the liquid lip right over
the highlight I'm using today is from is

going to pop a little bit of that on my
cheekbones
