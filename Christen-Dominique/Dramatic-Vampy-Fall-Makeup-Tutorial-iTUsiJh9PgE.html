doo-doo-doo-doo just want to put fangs
on and just embrace myself being a
vampire hey guys welcome back to my
channel so today we are gonna be doing
this very intense vampire fall I need a
pumpkin spice latte but I want to suck
your blood at the same time so this is
the darkest lip I've done on my channel
honestly I saw this lip and I was like I
need that I hope you guys enjoy it if
you want to see how to get it then don't
forget to subscribe to my channel and
hit that notification though so you
could be a part of the quad family and
without further ado let's get on with a
video and my voice is kind of going out
before I put on any primary foundation
or any creams in my face I'm gonna do my
brows so that the pencil adheres to my
skin better so I'm using the precisely
my brow pencil from benefit in number 5
we are just going to fill in the brows
make the brows look snatched this is one
of the easiest pencils to do your brows
with it's so quick it's so fast it's
precise you can fill in brush through so
friggin easy to do your brows I love
this brow pencil brows are done now that
we have our brows on I'm gonna do my
eyes I still have lash glue that I
cannot take out from my the last time I
had makeup on which is like two days ago
that's because I'm using the House of
lashes lash glue and that thing does not
get out of your eyes if I use that glue
I will always have residue throughout my
lashes and it's just so hard to take
away so I'm gonna put on some concealer
on my eyes as a base this is our primer
and cover up those veins I'm using that
naked skin from Urban Decay dirty oh my
god this thing is so freakin dirty I
will be right now okay now that I have
my clean Beauty Blender with me I'm
gonna go ahead and work that into my
eyes this thing has been through so much
traveling it is not
funny to sip my I am pleased to a bone
color on the lid so I'm gonna be using
the TARDIS Pro palette today first I'm
gonna take innocent and just wash that
through the crease back in four I'm
gonna take a little bit of whimsy and go
straight through the crease and I even
want to take a yellow and I want to run
that through their yellow kylie vacation
palette has a yellow in it so I'm gonna
take this yellow right here and then I'm
gonna run it through the crease I feel
like this look is calling yellows name
just to blend everything out then it
takes away from it being so red or warm
I was on Pinterest and I was looking up
fall makeup looks just to get inspired
and I saw Shay Mitchell with this
beautiful look and I don't know if this
is yellow or what it is but I want a
yellow on my eye I'm definitely feeling
like the mustard needs to happen so now
that we have that crease I'm gonna add
edgy on the lid all the way up into the
crease so I'm going to start right at
the bottom of the one right here and
then just Pat it all the way through
until I work it up into the crease okay
so I'm gonna start off with a light
layer of this brown and then I'm gonna
deepen it up as we go I'm gonna layer on
smoked in drama I'm just gonna dip my
brush into both of these and layer it
right on top
I just did 100 layers of eyeshadow and
this is what I got for some reason it's
a little bit on the patchy son I'm not
gonna lie but it's okay we can make it
work I'm actually not gonna put on a
brow bone color just because I see I
like the way this looks for now who
knows if I might change my mind a little
whiter but I'm gonna go ahead and do my
eyeliner so the eyeliner that I'm using
is from Kat Von D this is the inked
liner the waterproof liquid liner in
trooper I'm gonna go ahead and do a cat
eye y'all ready for this doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo doo doo okay my door it's
official if you're having trouble with
your wing being lopsided eyeliner wings
will never be lopsided if you just drag
them out to the ends of your eyebrows
unless your eyebrows are lopsided then
that's a different story all right it's
time to get some mascara on our lashes
so I'm going to take the roller lash
from benefit and pop that onto my lashes
just right through there really quick
wiggle wiggle
try it out like five different lashes
and the lashes that work for me or the
ones that I use they're just my trusty
they go with everything go lashes that
I'm using today is from Lily lashes the
I know I just took this one off these
are the Miami lashes and I just I just
love them they're fluffy they're curled
they have enough hair but not too much
you can see the eye shadow look it's
just beautiful
there's no lash glue on these lashes
just I'm gonna use this primer right
here from Smashbox because they're new
primer the photo finish primer Iser it's
a primer and a moisturizer in one and it
does miracles if you have dry skin so my
skin is pretty dry work it into my hands
and then work it into my action the
foundation I'm using is from Too Faced
this is the peach perfect comfort matte
foundation I haven't used one of these
brushes in a very long time but this is
the artiste brush and I'm going to use
that to put on my foundation today
I like the peaches and cream collection
but I like it separately I don't like it
all together because I think it's too
much peach scent but I love the fact
that this smells like peach and it's 14
hour wear and full coverage so many good
things about this
for my concealer I'm going to use the
Naked skin concealer from urban decay to
cover these bags case you guys are
wondering this is the light and neutral
shade a little turned-up nose it's so
funny how I'm using this now because I
literally could not stand these little
things I feel like they were just so
annoying and did nothing and now I find
them so useful I'm just like $18.00 for
two of these little tiny things that
don't do much uh-uh like I was so
against it but now I love it after
playing with it like I know how to use
it so worth it
I'm gonna use the benefit hoola kwikki
contour stick to snatch my cheeks and my
nose
in my chin cuz I've been eating honestly
I've been eating so bad jackin the-box
Starbucks like I need to take a break so
I have to do some face surgery right now
faces snatch so now we're gonna move on
to the lower lashes I'm basically gonna
do the same thing we did to everything
at the top so starting off with whimsy
and innocent working that on the lower
lash line then I'm gonna add that yellow
from the vacation palette and then we're
gonna go in with edgy smoke and drama
for the inner waterline I'm gonna take
this Marc Jacobs eyeliner in marigolds
put that right on the waterline because
we have so much dark around our eyes
this Gold's gonna brighten it up but
it's still gonna keep that warm fall
vibe with it being gold put the yellow
right on the inner corner so I'm just
taking a little brush I'm gonna set my
face with the Kat Von D powder in light
46 right under in my eyes down the rest
of my face
and then some bronze up my face I'm
going to use the essence Sun Club matte
bronzing powder in natural so I'm just
on that right on my cheekbones it's a
little light Sun on my face and then for
blush I'm going to use the Kat Von D
Lolita blush I want this look to be
really nice and matte so I'm gonna
spritz on this peach miss mattifying
spray now everything's nice and matte
I'm gonna move on to the fall vampy lip
which I'm super excited about it haven't
done a vampy lip in ages so so I'm gonna
first line up my lips with the Max
cyberworld
lip liner I'm going to add this super
vampy lip this is from Make Up For Ever
it's the 5:05 matte liquid lipstick well
