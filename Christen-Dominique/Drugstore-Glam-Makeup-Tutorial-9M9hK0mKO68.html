today I'm gonna be doing this look right
here do you see this drama happening
this is so much drama for me this week I
actually just last-minute put my hair up
like this and it's not fancy I literally
was just playing around I was like
posing and like you it just cute and
this is what it looks like fancy huh I
like it I really love this look I feel
like it's something I've never done
everything that's on my face right now
is drugstore something you can buy super
affordable in stuff that I actually
really really like some things I'm
trying for the first time and you'll be
able to see how I feel about those later
in this video and then some things I
found that we're just like did this
entire look using one palette this
palette right here this is the
maybelline city mini palette
collaboration with Shayla Mitchell aka
makeup Shayla on Instagram and YouTube
this is such a beautiful palette I was
very usually these paths the city mini
pallets are all shimmer this one has a
nice combination of a little bit of
everything this can go from day to night
after hours you can go through every
type of look through your day with just
this little tiny palette which i think
is amazing so congratulations to you
Shayla I think this is a beautiful
palette this is the look I created I
love it I just want to go watch Netflix
now because that's my life I'm gonna
show you how I got this I look right
here if you want to learn how to get it
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
and hit that notification bell so you
can be a part of the quad family and
without further ado let's get on with
the video the first thing I'm going to
start with is foundation and that's
because I have all this going on right
here
I just got extractions this morning on
my face from Yoli glow she does these
extractions and then two days later they
look they're completely gone and it
looks amazing
so I want to cover this up so I want you
guys to like run away from my channel
right now if this is the shade natural
beige I like the shades are on top of
the tops so I'm just gonna put that on
real quick I'm gonna use elf brush to
apply it to my face now I'm just going
to do a very light coverage I just don't
want you guys to keep looking at these
crazy blemishes and I like that this has
like an acne treatment in it so it's not
going to clog my pores or anything
especially since I just
got a facial this morning I'm gonna put
on a light layer and then I'm gonna
start working on my own these brows
because look at these brows for the
brows i'm gonna use this hairy eyebrow
pencil this is the Loreal brow stylist
definer in the shade brunette so I'm
just gonna fill in my brows ever so
naturally and then usually if I fill
them in and they're pretty like
natural-looking I'll go in heavier
towards the end depending on how intense
my eye look is so I'm just gonna go for
kind of a natural brow right now try not
to look too close because sometimes when
I look too close this is just my
personal experience with myself when
you're doing your brows super close up
sometimes they come out a little bit
more extreme and harsh and sometimes
even bigger than what you would normally
do them if you had a further away mirror
and then when you've been back the
Barrow away it's like oh my god look at
a mirror from a distance so you're not
getting like a crazy amount of brow in
places you don't need it okay so my
brows are filled in the first thing that
I'm going to do is work on my eyes
before concealer I'm going to be using
this Rimmel London one it's called match
perfection and it says skin adapting
concealer hmmm this isn't shade medium
I'm gonna use this as a base for my eye
and this is actually kind of dark I
thought it's gonna be a little bit
lighter no medium is medium but I just
went to go look for a lighter shade and
I have this one in light medium which is
right in the middle I don't want it to
be too light but I don't want to be too
dark and then while we're here I'm just
gonna go under the under eyes really
quick and just tap top that in there
from the inner corners so now that we
have concealed face basically because I
concealed my whole face they were gonna
get into the Maybelline X makeup shayla
collab this is the palette that she
created with Maybelline I think it's
such a nice palette I've already
swatched everything it is very creamy
and I'm really liking the pigmentation
on these shadows and there's enough math
in here so that you can create an actual
full-on look with just one palette so
this is the only
I'm gonna be using for this look so this
is the base it even says it on the the
pallet look how pigmented that is take
the base color apply it all over my
eyelid and the brush that I'm using is
from ELF
and since we working are really good so
now that everything is set in place we
have our base down so now I'm gonna take
this brown shade right here with a
blending brush and I'm gonna work it on
the outer part of the lid and into the
crease and the first layer is gonna be
pretty light so it's just a very light
wash of color at first and then we're
going to build it up that's a great
thing about this palette is that it is
very buildable you can start off light
as light as you want and you can build
up the intensity to the darkest that you
want so that's a really good thing about
this palette because it is very
buildable so in case you don't want a
ton of pigment at first and I'm just
gonna use circular motions and work that
on the outer part of the lid now I'm
gonna just build up that intensity on
the outer part of the lid so the next
shade that I'm going to work into the
crease is this purple right here
okay so now I'm gonna go into the
deepest darkest shade which is this
black color right here and I'm gonna hit
right in the outer V and we're gonna
focus this really low build it up as we
go we don't ever want to just BAM with a
bunch of black in our eyes I'm gonna
bring that all the way in
actually right into the inner corner and
then for the lid I'm gonna take this
shade right here these shadows are so
soft and so creamy and so pigmented she
did an amazing job on these shadows hack
that on to the inner part of the lid for
the brow bone I'm gonna go in with that
base color and start to work that right
underneath we're gonna that's basically
gonna clean it up and redefine the brow
and if you brought too much too high we
can or get back down now I'm gonna start
to work the purple on the bottom lash
line to give it a pop and I'm gonna use
this little smudger brush for that the
pigmentation on these shadows is insane
it's crazy crazy pigmented for the inner
waterline I'm gonna take this Milani
purple liner in fixed on plum and I'm
gonna work that right in there so I'm
gonna take this Maybelline master
precise ink master precise in the shade
black comet so we're going to use this
to make a very fierce intense dark wing
now I'm gonna bring my lashes to life
with some mascara because they are no
gala actually also has mascara as a part
of her collection she did a blue a
purple this is the purple one and a
black one and I love their names there
so her this is popping purple and the
baddest black I'm actually gonna mix
them together because I want to have a
little bit of that purple pop into my
lashes I think it's a really good
contrast for brown eyes so I'm gonna
first put on the purple and by the way
this I mean the colossal Big Shot is one
of my most favorite mass
Jerez other than the l'oreal lash
paradise this one is absolutely amazing
so I'm so excited to use it and that the
fact that they have it in color is even
better and then I'm going to take the
black and also mix it in with the purple
the lashes that I'm using are not
drugstores so I'm just gonna pop them on
off-camera
but they are I will let you know what
they are they're the huda beauty lashes
and scarlet the number eight
they look like this and I will be back
with some fam lashes I'm actually gonna
add a little bit of this Rimmel nude
eyeliner right in the middle of the wing
and the purple pop on a highlight
because I feel like we need a little bit
of highlight in her life by a little I
mean a lot so I'm gonna take this
Maybelline strobing stick illuminator
highlight and I also have this dewy
stick thing from ELF
it's called targeted natural glow stick
so I'm gonna take this it's like a bomb
so you kinda gives you like that natural
glow then oh so now we have our
highlight on I feel like it's a very
subtle glowy dewy kind of highlight now
I'm just gonna make sure everything is
stuffed in place and doesn't go anywhere
so I'm gonna take the Maybelline fit me
foundation in light so I'm just gonna go
ahead and use that right okay I just put
it on my hair if you want to see if
something is your color which I think
this is gonna be my color even though it
says light always test it right on your
jaw line this is gonna look a little
pinky on me but most drugstore powders
do so this is kind of what we're gonna
deal with today I'm gonna use this elf
duo and Saint Lucia I'm gonna take this
to contour my face so I'm just gonna go
right on the cheekbones though then did
up snatch those cheekbones
and then go around the sides for the
nose I'm gonna use the same one and this
is something different I wouldn't
normally want to use something with any
type of shimmer like super super
SuperDuper matte but we are trying new
things out today stepping out of our
norm and it's actually not like crazy
shimmery everywhere so it's not so bad
even for the nose this is a really nice
contour color actually and then for the
blush I'm gonna take this side right
here because we have so much going on
with the eyes I do want to keep it more
on than
actual side for the cheeks and the lips
for the lip color I'm gonna go in with
this Rimmel lip liner in innocent it's
just a nude this is one of those lip
pigment cancelling kind of shades for me
so I'm just gonna use it to my advantage
and cancel out my entire lip color I
hate talking and doing lips why do I do
that to myself is then we'll be able to
see the true color of the shade we're
gonna put it right on top for the lip
color I'm gonna take this maybelline
superstay matte ink and Loyalists I
haven't seen this before we are going to
pop that on top oh it smells so good
I think I want to go get dessert this
almost feels like it should be a gloss
so I'm really interested to see how it's
going to dry down it's not like dry it
doesn't feel dry okay it's drying down
and I feel the difference it does dry
kind of sticky but um when you first put
it on it feels like a gloss so that's
really interesting I don't mind it it's
a matte lipstick so it's gonna feel a
little dry and I'm fine with that this
is the final look I hope you guys like
it watching I hope you enjoyed this
video if you liked it you know what to
do give it a big fat thumbs up if you
missed some other videos I'll have them
hanging out over the side for you guys
