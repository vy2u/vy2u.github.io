what are you doing hold on I have the
shortest hands of life honestly they're
so small that's where I need to be right
now hey guys welcome back to my channel
so today I'm going to be doing a
drugstore prom makeup tutorial I know a
lot of you guys in high school don't
have a huge budget I know I didn't I
were to Abercrombie I made like $6 an
hour can only afford maybe a few lunches
that was pretty much it so anything that
I got was from the drugstore so I went
to the drugstore and I have a whole face
of slayage with drugstore makeup and
honestly looking at the makeup I cannot
believe that I created this look using
all drugstore least laid our eyeshadow
brows lives contour everything from the
drugstore I cannot wait to show you guys
what I use because it's super affordable
which shows you that you don't need
super expensive makeup to look super
expensive subscribe to my channel and
hit the notification bow so you can be a
part of the quad family so if you're
ready to slay prom let's begin I've
never done that we're gonna start off
with priming our face so I'm going to
take this Milani prime shield
it's a mattifying and pore minimizing
oil-free primer so when I have primers
like this what I like to do is top them
into my skin because they are going to
get into your pores and fill them in and
make your skin look super flawless so
the best thing to do with these type of
pore minimizing primer x' is to top them
into your skin or you can focus them
more on the areas where you have really
large scary pores and you can just like
with your nose usually around my nose I
have that but I'm going to do all over
my face because I want my face to look
flawless for prom so I'm just going to
even out my skin tone just do a light
Flair foundation and I'm going to use
this Ecotools
Beauty sponge and the foundation I'm
using is from Maybelline it's for normal
to oily and it's the matte and poreless
foundation and I am in the shade 128
which is warm nude I'm just going to
bounce it onto my skin when you're using
those modifying primers you want to make
sure that anything you put on top of it
you want to bounce it onto your skin if
you rub it into your skin back and forth
or if you use a brush then you can
sometimes bring up dry flakiness I
picked up this little brow kit from wet
and wild so I'm going to use the darkest
shade and start to fill out the tail end
of my brow I'm actually going to take
the middle shade I think I'm going a
little too crazy with this dark shade
the lighter shade I'll bring towards the
front because I don't want the front to
be super dark
I actually think doing your brows with
powder gives you the most natural
looking brow so now that our brows are
done I'm going to go ahead and prime my
eyes I'm going to use the Maybelline
master conceal in the shade light/medium
start to top that into my lid and you
don't need a lot just a little tiny bit
goes a long way if you put too much then
you'll get a lot of creasing in your
eyes what's gonna help your eyeshadow
really stay in place is setting it with
a powder I'm gonna go in with my ELF
shadow brow and liner palette I'm going
to go in with that bone color and place
it right on top of the concealer just to
lock the cream in place and it also is
going to have make our eye really smooth
so that anything that goes on top of it
is going to glide on so I'm just going
to work my brush into these shades right
here a little bit into this one for the
crease and i'm using this Ecotools brush
and it's the blend side there's a smudge
in a blend and work these shades right
into the crease she's gonna be our first
crease shade just to give us a nice
little dimension just go back and forth
back and forth it's very subtle but you
can definitely see the difference in
these subtle little shadows that you're
putting on your eyes are gonna make a
world of a difference at the end if it
may not seem like it's doing much now
but it's all part of the process they
all work together for a good cause for
your eyes to Salette one prom day so I'm
going to go into that shade right there
it's like a rustic pink looking color
and I'm just going to work that right
back and forth into the crease I'm using
a brush that has more of a point to it
now
I'm doing that because I wanted to focus
right on the crease I'm going to bring
it in towards the inner corner of the
lid so now I'm going to take this purple
color right here and I'm going to work
that into the crease next and I'm using
the same brush just work it right in
there try to keep it below the pink so
it makes that nice gradient I take this
L'Oreal infallible paint and I take this
side right here it's called cool ivory
actually the whole thing is called cool
I breathe I'm taking this golden shade
over here it's like champagne looking
color and I'm going to pack it on to the
lid and then I'm going to top my
concealer brush on the edges of this so
that it cleans it up and then for the
liner I'm going to use this L'Oreal
infallible paint liquid eyeliner right
here and I'm just going to create a wing
right across on the top actually I
almost forgot about my brow bone I'm
going to go into my brow bone with a
nice bone color just to work into the
rest of the shadows and this part is
really just going to clean up the crease
and enhance the the shape of your brows
I'm going to take this shade right here
and I'm going to pop that right on to
the brow bone and I honestly feel like
this makes your eye shadow look super
crisp and clean and then for mascara I'm
going to go in with the Maybelline
colossal Big Shot and I put some on
before I put on falsies just to prepare
our lashes and then for the lashes I
think I'm gonna go in with these Ardell
mega volume lashes right here okay so
now we're done with the eyes I'm going
to go ahead and do the rest of the face
I'm just going to add a little bit more
foundation and concealer like patience
is a key with doing your makeup because
if you don't then you get really
frustrated you do things too fast too
hard and you just want to get it over
with so just have patience if you're
doing your own makeup this prom for
concealer I'm going to take the master
conceal from Maybelline I'm gonna put it
right underneath my under eye right on
my under eyes actually just tap it in
with my finger just a warmth of your
fingers gonna make the makeup melt into
your skin really easy and smooth so
sometimes I just rather use my fingers
if you want more
coverage underneath your eyes then you
just tap with a lighter hand so the
corners in my mouth are kind of dark so
I'll put some concealer here just to
brighten it up a little bit next I'm
going to contour somebody is just dream
brightening creamy concealer it's
actually concealer but we're going to
use it as a contour stick and then I'm
going to get right on my nose and then
right on the top I like to create a
little ball right here sometimes I think
it looks cute so I'm going to go ahead
and clean it up with this side right
here just Pat it down and bring it down
onto the sides
when you do your contour I feel like
it's easier and it looks a little bit
more natural if you do just the cream
contour try not to go too low because
I'm just going to look like you have a
little bit of a shadow down here which
gives you more of a manly look and then
I'm going to go ahead and highlight with
this Maybelline strobing liquid right
here and this is in light iridescent so
I'm going to take some on my hand looks
like this it's so pretty
right on the high points of my face I
like to do it right on the center of my
nose too and a little bit down here
Cupid's bow and then I'll just tap it in
with my finger so when the light hits
your cheekbones girl
so we're nice and highlighted contoured
skin is looking good you want to wait
just a second before you set everything
in place make sure everything is blended
look at it really quick make sure that
your foundation is blended down to your
neck once you're good with your skin you
feel like it looks good everything's
blended then you can sit everything in
place with this powder and this is
porcelain from Maybelline so I'm going
to take this little brush right here
from Ecotools and then just work that
into the powder and kind of tap it over
the areas that I want to set so
underneath my eyes and I'm using a
lighter powder under my eyes because I
want to brighten them up a little bit
more so I'm using that tapping motion so
nothing is moved around it's literally
just sitting right on top of each other
and then bring it around here because
it's a little bit dark in the space so
I'm going to tap it around and brighten
up the spot I'm going to take a darker
shade of this powder and I'm just going
to go ahead and set the contour in place
so I'm just going to Pat it in that area
and then I'm going to move it upwards
and then to add some warmth to my face
and give us some nice color I'm going to
take this Rimmel matte bronzer right
here start to work that right on my
cheeks I'm going to go around the temple
so with your bronzer try not to bring it
down to low and then for the blush I'm
going to take this one right here from
Wet n Wild it's the color icon in mellow
wine top my brush in there and
add a little bit to the cheekbone and
then for the highlight I'm going to take
this powder it's from Milani it's called
the prep set glow it's a transparent
powder has those little sparkles in it
that without overpowering your entire
face and work it right on the cheekbone
and it gives us a really nice natural
glow without it being too crazy I'm
going to go ahead and go in with this
elf lip liner take this natural shade on
this side it's a matte natural color and
I'm just going to outline my lips and
then for the lip color I'm going to take
this L'Oreal and follow the lip paint I
like that this sponge has a little curve
to it so it contours to your lip it's
super comfortable oh it's not sticky at
all I'm actually going to get this
bronzer right here and just add a little
bit of a shadow to the lower lash line
and I'm taking some mascara and just
coating the bottom lashes I'm actually
gonna go in with some eyeliner on the
lower lash line so I'm gonna take this
L'Oreal liner I barely tapped down the
liner but you know L'Oreal always has
the darkest drugstore black liner
another really important part after
you're all done with your makeup you
want to set your makeup so it last all
throughout the night so I'm going to
take this master fix we're boosting
setting spray right here and try to keep
it far away and if you have lashes cover
your eyes so your lashes don't come off
and your makeup will stay in place all
day the powder is going to help it stay
in place but that setting spray is
really going to lock it in and you can
have fun the rest of the night and not
worry about your makeup
