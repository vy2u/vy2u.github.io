channel today I have a really fun video

Laura Lee here with me
hey hat trick be sure to check out
Laura's video it's going to be in the
description below and also Patrick just
did a prom makeup tutorial so check that
out and jump right in the video
okay so I'm gonna get started with
primer first thing I'm going to do is
use primer because I want my makeup to
last you're gonna be at prom dancing
sweating all this crazy stuff so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna mix two
primers this is the Hydra touch Nick's
base primer and then I'm going to go
ahead and mix it with this color
correcting primer mix it put it on your
face look with my nail polish so for the
foundation I'm going to use this one
right here this is L'Oreal's True Match
Lumi it's a BB cushion so just press it
in there and you get the foundation and
to work that into your skin
next I'm gonna use the NYC smooth skin
liquid concealer right here and I'm
going to use this to brighten up my
under eyes I'm gonna bring it really
close into the inner corners clean that
up real quick I have so much foundation
in my brows there as my brush I'll just
use this really long one right here I'm
gonna use a lot of Nick stuff because
that's a lot of the stuff that I have
that's drugstore so if you notice I'm
using a lot of Nick's stuff it's this is
not sponsored or anything like that so
for my brows I'm going to use brunette
creme brunette and this is the NYX
sculpt and highlight brow
for my crease I'm going to use this NYC
labott X palette by Demi Lovato my take
this shade right here kind of reminds me
of Bach from The Naked palette the naked
one
that's actually a really nice transition
shade and then for the lid I'm going to
go in with Bella ivory a Milani shadow
this one is Smith two five six here I'm
gonna use that for my lid and I'm going
to go ahead and pack that onto the lid
necessary for you to make this face so
you want to turn your smile look like
you're frowning like you're sad and you
know you're doing it right
I'm actually going to take this pink
from the MOBOTIX palette it's really
cute right here this one and pack it on
to the inner part of the lid now I'm
just going to deepen up the crease area
so I'm going to use there's a dark brown
shade right here use that one what I'm
doing is getting lower and lower with
the crease shade you want it's shade
that you apply to show just above the
new one just below the lighter brown
so I'm going to take this Black's called
a feller black super dart and work that
very close to the outer V area I'm going
to clean it up a little bit on the edges
so I'm going to take some concealer okay
I'm going to grab my Milani
itec define I'm not that skilled in the
marker area of brows yet I'm using the
eyeliner and the eyeliner is so black it
Super's the relaxed so I'm going to use
a side I'm going to create a wing
I'm gonna put on some mascara the method
I'm using is NYC the lebot --ax by dummy
I can keep my mouth closed while doing
that mascara skills now I'm going to put
on some eyeliner the eyeliner I'm using
is the Milani supreme cool Kajal
eyeliner the jaw next I'm going to use
this glitter right here this is a
glitter glue and I'm going to take it
into the inner corners it's not my
makeup I'm going to use the NYX HD
finishing powder in bandana I'm going to
use this brush right here for underneath
my eyes already kind of dipped it in
there I also like to take the yellow
around my mouth because it brightens up
this area and this area is pretty dark
for me just to set everything for the
blush I'm going to use the Maybelline
master contour palette and I'm going to
take the blush shade when I mix the
blush and the contour shade together to
just warm up the pink
and then I'm going to use the highlight
to highlight now I'm going to do my lips
I'm going to use this nude lip liner
from Nick I'm going to take it and just
fill in the whole lip and then I'm going
to use this NYX lingerie of liquid
lipstick in satin ribbon
