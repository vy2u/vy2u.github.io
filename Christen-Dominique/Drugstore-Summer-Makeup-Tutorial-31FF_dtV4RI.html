welcome back to my channel so today I'm
gonna be showing you how to get this
summer drugstore makeup look right here
it is super easy looks great on every
skin tone and that's like my goal every
time I make a video or create a look I
want it to be super easy for you guys to
do I want it to look good on all the
skin tones and there is this freaking
motorcycle just like to be super easy
for you guys to do so I think I achieved
that with this look it's very girly
flirty and fun but it's not like a
winged liner or glitter and it's it's
not hard at all it's super easy and it's
very affordable which I love about this
video everything is super affordable
it's not like super expensive drugstore
it's very affordable drugstore so you
guys are gonna love it and if you want
to learn how to get this look then don't
forget to subscribe to my channel and
hit that notification bell so you can be
a part of the QWOP family and without
further ado let's get on I'm gonna use
this L'Oreal visible lift radiance
booster brightening primer 24-hour
hydration this is definitely the longest
name I have ever seen for a primer let's
see if it lifts our face brightens it oh
it comes out like this peachy color
that's cute you guys ah my face is
breaking out so so bad I'm really good
at taking off my makeup but one night I
didn't do it or just fell asleep and bam
Pizza face I thought it would be a
little bit thicker because of the way it
came out on my hand but it's actually
pretty lightweight and it doesn't feel
greasy okay we are gonna do a BB cream I
have not tried this Rimmel one out
before this is the radiance I'm gonna
try to put this on with a Beauty Blender
so I have my Beauty butter right here
I'm just gonna work that all over let's
see what this does for the face today oh
my goodness well then
what I'm using like a rolling motion to
do it I mean that'll work a little bit
better actually I'm actually gonna take
it off because I really don't like the
way it looks and it's really weird like
you can't pat it and you have to move it
around I'm taking this off
sometimes there's got to be a point we
got to tie yourself it's not gonna work
out all right I decided to go with the
L'Oreal infallible Pro matte because my
skin is looking a little bit crazy my
pores are out there my acne he's out
there it's all over the place right now
so I just need everything to calm down
be one smooth looking surface and then
we'll add the highlight in little areas
that we want to so I am in the shade Sun
beige that on my face my face is a
little bit lighter than my body so it'll
look a little bit different but we're
gonna work that into our neck and
everything's gonna look do you see how
many breakouts I have right now when I
have breakouts like this it's best to
stick with something that is a little
bit more on the medium to full coverage
side I love how this blends into your
skin it's so easy just go over the eyes
redness right there just cover it up and
this isn't totally matte it's like a
dummy matte finish but it doesn't have
those reflective illuminating particles
in the foundation so it's okay for skin
that is a little bit more broken out so
I'm gonna let that sit and dry I'm gonna
do my brows put on another layer
Foundation and be right back with some
concealer before I go into my brows I
just want you guys to know what I'm
using it's but I feel like I always tell
you what I'm using it's this wet and
wild it's the same line from like 10
videos already the wet and wild ultimate
brow kit it's super cheap I love it it's
just like I don't know it's my go-to
right now so I'm gonna do my brows
off-camera and also this is my new brow
brush that I've been loving from dose of
colors it's like very super slanted very
narrow kind of disappears when you turn
it on its side I'm loving the tight
bristles on the spoolie so I just did my
brows really quick I concealed them
underneath just to sharpen them up and
if you guys want a brawl tutorial please
let me know in the comments I can do
that in another video add another layer
of foundation and I'm
feeling so much better about my skin
let's move on to the Panda I area of my
face so for that I'm gonna go with the
master conceal from Maybelline this is
one of my favorite drugstore concealers
this is the light/medium shade I'm just
gonna use my mini micro Beauty Blender
for the under eyes do you see how much
coverage this concealer has and it dries
really nice this concealer just glides
on the skin so smoothly it doesn't
settle in the fine lines it just kind of
smoothes them out and then for the edges
I just take the little round side to
smooth everything out this is the matte
format 2 by L love this palette and I
want to go for a more of a Mavi looking
eye this one right here I'm gonna Pat it
all over the eyelids like I do just to
set all the cleans in place so we don't
have patchy areas if you don't have an
eyeshadow that isn't pretty much similar
to your skin tone
then go ahead and use your face powder
so the next shade I'm gonna go into are
these two right here for my crease
they're pretty I know but let's not talk
about the nails today these are gonna be
my crease color into the socket so I'm
going to stay right in there
and just go back and forth and these
windshield wiper motions back and forth
then I'm gonna go ahead and use these
circular motions to kind of buff out the
color at the edges always want to work
towards the brow bone especially if you
want more of a lifted I look always work
upwards and what I'm doing to the top
I'm going to go ahead and do to the
lower lash line as well so I'm gonna
take a smaller brush this one right here
is from Urban Decay this is the moondust
e210 brush and I'm just going to take
those same two shades and work them on
the lower lash line these are the pinky
tone shades I'm going to take both of
them and work them into
lid so right below the crease and just
Pat it into the lid I'm gonna take the
red and I'm gonna also layer it right
below but I still want that kind of like
what we did with the crease I still want
those to shade to peek through even just
patting it down on the lash line would
be even better I'm gonna take it all the
way I have this other palette from
Maybelline I haven't opened it yet it's
called the city mini palette downtown
sunrise and there's this really pretty
color I want to use for the inner
corners it's right here and it also has
like a brighter shade that I can use on
my brow bone so I'm just gonna open that
up really quick and I'm going to use
that so I'm going to take this flatter
brush right here and work it into this
shade right here highlight the brow bone
with this and it has a soft pink
undertone which works fine with this
look as it is a a Mavi look and then I'm
gonna take a big fluffy brush just to
blend everything together and this is
the part where you're gonna soften out
the look you have any harsh edges if you
got you missed the clean fluffy brush
will definitely pick those up for you
and then for the lower waterline I'm
going to take this Remmel Gandil eyes
pencil and it's like a nude color it's
called nude the lower part of your eye
or you just your eye in general such a
sensitive area that you can easily get
wrinkles around your eyes so try not to
tug too hard if you could just press in
and do this that would be fine but just
try not to tug your eyes too much I
personally like using the nude as
opposed to the white for the lower lash
line I feel like it's white is more
awake it gives me more of a Halloween
kind of look it's very dramatic and
bright but this new just makes it look
like you have a healthy waterline it
doesn't look red or bright right it's
just a nude yes to makes your eyes look
bigger if you want to have a bigger eye
or if your eyes are a little bit close
together having that bright nude color
just kind of softens everything out I
think I want to brighten up the inner
corner so I'm going to take this shade
right here for the highlight drugstore
mascaras of the
year definitely have been this
Maybelline Big Shot colossal and also
the lash paradise from L'Oreal okay so I
just popped on these lashes these are
from Lily lashes the Miami style which
are not drugstore but I will have them
listed in the description bar below so
you guys know where to get them so now
I'm just gonna set and sculpt my face
I'm going to use this pixie X Miriam a
kiosk
contour palette so I'm gonna go ahead
and use the lighter shade to set the
under eyes and then to bronze the face
I'm gonna go in with this Rimmel matte
bronzer and starts to work that on top
of the cheekbone around temples and
forehead
I like this bronzer right here because
it gives you like a natural looking tan
to sculpt my face I'm going to use the
contour shades in here so I'm gonna take
these this one right here and just go
right on the cheekbone
ooh this is a really nice contour color
it's like a natural looking color
nice job mariya variance light one of my
friends here on youtube if you don't
know who she is you guys need to check
her out she is amazing she's an amazing
artist so for the blush I'm gonna go in
with this NYX away.we glow illuminating
powder this is in crushed rose and
dusted on my cheeks for the highlight I
saw this I was like oh we have a new
highlight to play with it's so exciting
this is from Maybelline it's the master
chrome metallic highlighter very excited
to try this guy out I want to see how it
works so I'm gonna use my finger that's
very gold and just use it on my nose and
the Cupid's bow wow this is intense
look at that highlight and it feels like
almost like a cream when you run your
finger across it this is definitely one
of those metallic highlights just like
it says right there I don't have any
breakouts just put it in places that is
going to bring out your skin I make it
worse alright so now that we have that
all over our face we are going to move
on to the lips I'm gonna go ahead and
pop on this nude lip liner it's called
nude whisper this is from Maybelline and
I'm gonna line my lips really quick and
then right over its super natural but
right over I'm going to use this vivid
hot lacquer and it too cute
