today is super exciting ok I have never
ever had this much expensive makeup in
my hands ever in my life and I am gonna
be testing expensive extreme expensive
high-end makeup on one side of my face
and the other side I'm gonna be doing
nothing but drugstore I don't know about
you but I think they look pretty similar
except for a few little things just a
few little things okay so you guys we
are using Tom for Dior Givenchy like
super expensive expand its it's
expensive so I'm really excited to show
you guys I have never ever spent as much
money on makeup in my life to be honest
I want you guys to let me know which
side do you think is high-end and which
side do you think is drugstore I'm gonna
give you one side here okay and then
here's the other side there's both sides
okay now pause the video comment below
which side do you think is drugstore
which side do you think is high-end go
ahead I'll be waiting as soon as I
upload this video I'm gonna check
everybody's comments to see which ones
you think it is I think it's super
exciting to see what your thoughts are
on the makeup my personal thoughts you
will see later in this video there are
some pros and cons and I will let you
know what I think about everything in
the video but if you want to see how I
got this look right here see which side
is really drugstore don't forget to
subscribe to my channel and hit that
notification bow so you can be a part of
the quad family and without fruits I
know this isn't your quad you guys I
know it's a long story I know this is
not the quad but we are the quad family
only the quads get it the few the strong
the quads and without further ado let's
get in to this extreme high-end verse
drugstore so I'm actually really excited
to get into this because this is the
most high-end I've ever used in my life
for the high-end side I'm gonna use the
mr. smooth smoothing primer from
Givenchy
it's so fast I'm gonna put this on right
here this primer is pretty thick make
sure to get exactly half of my face
instantly it definitely absorbs quickly
it plums
the skin it definitely feels like a
baby's butt it's just like bouncing back
for this side of my face I'm gonna use
this primer from Rimmel it's the lasting
finish primer this primer actually feels
this same on the skin it has that thick
consistency and this is supposed to have
that smoothing effect on your skin as
well so this is really crazy
it feels the exact same balance is back
this one doesn't absorb into the skin as
quickly as this one this one's already
like gone so there goes the primers okay
so I'm gonna go onto the brows the next
expensive eyebrow pencil I have is from
YSL I feel so bougie right now this is a
while-- eyebrow pencil oh my god I think
number five has a little spoolie on the
end like that so I'm going to start to
fill in my brows on the bougie side the
color is really nice and natural I
really like the color of this usually
brow pencils are a little bit too warm
and not ashy enough or they're too ashy
to wear they're basically gray but this
one seems to match perfectly with my
hair glides on the skin pretty nice I
really love this color it's not just a
dry pencil it has enough wax enos to it
that it will actually grab the hairs and
press them in place which is something
that I really like and I love the color
of this brow pencil it just matches my
hair so perfect this is it this is good
sad because I don't think I'm gonna buy
you all the time but you're a good one
for the more affordable side of my face
I'm gonna use the Rimmel eyebrow pencil
in the shade dark brown so I'm gonna
just go in there and start to fill in my
brows this one is a little worn it looks
a little red this one isn't waxy but
it's very smooth it's not gonna hold
your brows in place but it'll definitely
fill them in totally different brow
colors completely different I definitely
see the difference this is definitely
not a do because of the wax enos and I
feel like this is gonna this feels like
it's gonna stay in place this one is
just hanging out for the high-end
version of my face I'm going to use the
Giorgio Armani luminous silk foundation
we all know this is a good one
this is in the shade of 5.75 I'm going
to take some on the back of my hand and
use my beauty blender start to work that
on my face
I like the formula it's really
lightweight it's creamy and it just sits
really nice on the skin I feel like this
foundation is good for like a day or
night time kind of look just wear a
light layer and you'll be good for the
day and it just looks natural and pretty
or you can build it up with a Beauty
Blender and really pack it in to the
skin and get more of a medium coverage I
think this is such a beautiful creamy
lightweight foundation I can't say any
more about it you guys know it is so
good I'm going to use the infallible Pro
glow from L'Oreal this is supposed to
give you that luminosity as well so I'm
gonna try this on the back of this hand
and instead of using a Beauty Blender on
the side I'm gonna use an elf sponge see
how that looks for us I could see why
they're calling it a glow because
obviously it gives you that loo luminous
dewy look but I don't think this will
work for everybody especially if you
have textured skin like mine right here
it kind of accentuates everything so I'm
gonna go ahead and jump into the eye
shadow palette the eye shadow palette
that I picked up that is high-end this
is the most expensive shadow file that
I've ever bought in my life
all of these products are the most
expensive products and they ever bought
in my entire life I bought the Natasha
de Nonna palette and this is the purple
and blue eyeshadow palette it is so
expensive it's two hundred and
thirtysomething dollars it has the names
of the shades on this little paper and
these are the eyeshadows i've swatched a
lot of them and they are so freakin
beautiful oh my gosh they are silky
creamy pigmented when you swatch them
they go on so even and beautiful i
absolutely love these whoo with saying
that i feel like this is a lot of colors
and it's almost overwhelming to look at
what do i do first
purple blue the only thing about this
palette doesn't have a transition shade
in it for being so extreme expensive
there is no transition shade I mean you
can use there's some matte shades here
and then there's this brown but it's not
really matte but I feel like I could
still get away with it being like a
transition shade it's more of a silky
kind of shadow so I'm gonna start off
with this color right here which is cool
plum I'm gonna work that all over the
lid up into the crease this is just
gliding on
I so soft and smooth like butter oh my
gosh I don't think this pallet is gonna
do it for me for the crease but I do
have this one from ELF it's the Aqua
Beauty palette looks like this these are
also super pigmented and I definitely
recommend you guys go and get this elf
aqua palette because it is extremely
pigmented you will not be unsatisfied
with this palette so I'm gonna go ahead
and use this shade right here I feel
like that's sort of similar to poor plum
I'm gonna put them side by side so you
guys can see what I'm talking about
these are the closest that I can get and
they both have that like satiny kind of
finish to them so I'm gonna go ahead and
use a different eye shadow brush for
this eye you're gonna go ahead and work
that the same way that we did the other
eye shadow it's not as pigmented but it
glides on the skin beautifully just like
the other one and it's a nice transition
I just think this eyes gonna look
slightly different so there is this deep
plum color right here if you haven't
tried the maybelline city mini palettes
you definitely have to try them out I'm
gonna take this shade right here this
matte shade and just start to work that
on the crease on the outer V of the eye
and I'm gonna make it go to a little
point right here to give it more of a
sultry look now go ahead and blend this
guy out
I could see this palette is so creamy
and pigmented that it may get patchy in
certain spots like I can see it already
getting a little patchy but it is
pigmented and they are creamy there's
just something about it sticking to the
oil of my skin maybe in certain areas
but it is a
really nice pallet my blending brush and
just start to soften out those edges I'm
gonna go on to the other eye I'm gonna
use that purple right here I'm gonna use
this little guy and work it on the outer
part of the eye bringing it in this is
gonna look a little different because it
doesn't have that plum undertone this is
more of a warm Brown I definitely like
the color of this one more than this one
right here definitely looks different on
the eye compared to the pan it just
looks great like a totally different
color almost blue which is really
interesting hmm
so I'm gonna add more on this side now
see if that makes a difference
totally different I look completely
different it looks like I have a blue
eye and a purple eye let's see how this
ends up for us okay so now for the lid I
think I'm gonna do this beautiful
beautiful color right here for the lid
so so pretty I'm gonna use that on the
inner part of the lid let me do a
close-up of it so this one right here
and then in the Natasha Danone a palette
where is this shade right here that is
kind of similar to this shade that's the
color that I'm gonna put on the inner
corners so far they look totally
different but you know let's see how we
end up so I'm gonna start off with the
high-end side I'm gonna take this I
shower brush from the makeup shock the
t48 and I'm gonna work that in there
it's like a really pretty gunmetal color
I'm telling you these eye shadows are in
sane oh my god if you are to go to
Sephora and swatch this palette you
would fall in love you would really fall
in love and you'd be like why's it that
looks good
I was I was like very hesitant to buy
this because it's $200 there's a $200
palette you guys it's very curious to
see how it would compare to a drugstore
brands on the other eye I'm gonna take
and work it into that shade and I'm
still working on my eye let's see what
this looks like
okay so far it looks kinda similar not
as pigmented but maybe it's buildable
and then I'm just going to blend out
those edges so they're not
so far I'm liking this I compared to
this one just because of that plum shade
kind of is not really the shade that it
looks like in the palette okay so next
I'm going to take this gorgeous blue
shade right here and I'm gonna pop that
on my lower lash line I actually already
started doing that but my camera turned
off out of nowhere so I'm gonna go ahead
and work that on my lower lash line I'm
gonna bring that all the way in I'm
gonna take that crease or the first
shade we started off with as the base
and work that right underneath and then
I'm gonna go on the other eye on the
side with the Maybelline Maybelline city
mini palette I'm gonna take this blue
right here and pop it on on this side
for the fancy side I'm gonna use the
hourglass liquid eye pen right here and
then for this side I'm gonna use the
L'Oreal voluminous liner nor liquid
eyeliner let's see if they act the same
they look like this they're the same
basically let's see which one works
better let me start with the bougie side
I have no complaints on this one it
works good it glides on it's very black
and it's really easy to work with so
since I'm not comparing lashes or
mascara I'm just gonna pop those on
really quick and then but if you want to
know which style I already know you guys
are gonna want to know I will always
have it in the description do not worry
but I will be back with some lashes and
we are going to go on to the rest of our
face so now I'm going to take a black
liner to the waterline for this side I'm
going to use the Givenchy black magic
pool liner and just place it right in
that waterline I'd have to say that this
is just like a regular black pencil it's
creamy its pigmented it's just like any
other black pencil I feel like you can
have the same quality at the drugstore
so I'm gonna go ahead and use the Rimmel
waterproof black eye liner it takes a
few more swipes but it pretty much ends
up the same move onto the concealer the
concealer I have the Guerlain I think
this I say it Guerlain concealer it is
the hydrant multi
perfecting concealer in blurring effect
I'm all about the blurs go ahead and
work that with my finger which is full
of eye shadow so and I have this big
long nail so I'm just gonna use the
smaller side of my beauty blender to
work that into this area right here this
little tiny area this is kind of amazing
it fills in all the creases also my
under eyes feel more plump and it's like
instant on the drugstore side I'm using
the Maybelline master conceal I'm gonna
put that on with this side which I think
it's a little bit too big but it's a
little bit lighter than the other one so
this looks a little more natural but it
does really conceal the under eyes and
it's a very light weight on this side
I'm going to use the Dior extreme
control powder I'm gonna just start to
work this into my skin so we can set all
the creams in place it doesn't look
cakey at all it doesn't even look
powdery then on this side I'm gonna use
the fit me powder from Maybelline store
foundations and powders are always a
little off for my skin tone so this one
is a little pinky for the high-end side
for contouring today on this side of my
face i'm using the Natasha de Nona
contouring sculpting powder looks like
so and I'm going to use my brush right
here to work that onto the face we start
like right in at the hollow really close
to the ear and then work my way upwards
this is a very natural looking contour
shade for me and then for this side of
my face the elf bronzer
so now we're moving on to the blush I'm
going to use this Marc Jacobs one in so
dirty I'm gonna use this Marc Jacobs one
in lush and libido shimmery blush and
work it right in to the temple and this
is a nice blush it goes on really smooth
it's easy to blend into the skin and
with the contour I really like this
blush and for the other side we're gonna
use the NYX away.we glow and this is in
the shade crushed rose for this side of
the face and it kind of has that sheer
color to it as well has little tiny
shimmers now we are going to test the
highlight my favorite part is testing
highlights so I have the Tom Ford
highlight over here the sheer
highlighting duo and reflex guilt so
this is the packaging so beautiful and
these are the highlight looks like that
this is like the more pinky or shade
they are so beautiful the golden shade
right on the tops of the cheekbone mmm
right here in the tip of the nose it's
gonna be really weird to compare on the
nose and this side of the cupid bow
they keep its bow tie let me take a
little bit down here - because I'm dry
it's beautiful
being high on makeup is kind of
dangerous for me because I don't know if
I'll be able to get this again okay for
the highlight on this side I have the
Wet n Wild mega glow highlighting powder
in golden flower crown this is a really
pretty highlight as well okay we got a
very extreme high the only the only bad
part of this is that my skin is so
textured on this side it's not gonna
look the same as this side like the
sides pretty this side is pretty glowy
too but doesn't look good on my skin for
the lips is a Dior lip liner in the
shade jungle brown it's a lip liner on
one side in a brush on the other so let
me just line up my
lips and then on this side I'm going to
use the Rimmel lip liner okay this is a
very natural lip liner this liner is a
lot lighter they're both pretty nice on
the lips they go on smooth and even and
it's just a color difference I'm gonna
move on to the lipstick so for the
lipstick I have this YSL lipstick and
number 70 so I'm gonna take that this is
the naked coral from Maybelline and
let's see what this looks like compare
it's a little bit brighter than the
other pretty much looks the same the
only difference really is the color of
the brow the crease color in the eye and
then the lip color is slightly off
everything else looks pretty much the
same except I like the foundation and
the skin overall on this side so this is
the final look
