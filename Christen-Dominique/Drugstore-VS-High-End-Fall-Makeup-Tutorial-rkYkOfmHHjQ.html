hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today I have a fun video for you guys i
am doing a high-end verse drugstore
makeup tutorial not particularly
particularly in that order I'm gonna be
showing you a bunch of dupes to create
this follow up it's very cozy me to show
you how I got this cozy fall makeup look
and using a lot of high-end Evers
drugstore twinzies love saving money
who doesn't love saving money so I want
you to save your money if you can I love
doing these videos are so helpful shows
you that you don't have to spend a ton
of money on makeup to get the same look
that I'm doing or other youtubers are
doing or magazines your favorite
celebrity your mom also I'm going to be
on style code live tonight it's a show
on amazon.com talks about all things
beading fashion and I am going to be
doing a segment on beauty Tay pack it's
pretty cool you might not want to miss
it it's gonna be on tonight at 9 p.m.
Eastern time 6 p.m. Pacific time I'll
have the link below so you guys can
check it out and if you want to learn
how to get this look and see which side
is which which tie do you think is which
drugstore high-end high-end drugstore
let me know in the comments see which
one is which I'm going to start off with
a high end foundation this one is from
Marc Jacobs
it's the remarkable full cover
foundation this is really really good at
covering your entire face with a new
layer of another face I'm going to use
this with my Beauty Blender just make
little dots
and I'm also going to be using a
different sponge for the other side of
my face that's a little bit more
affordable than the beauty blender the
beauty blender as everybody knows is
amazing it's $20 I think it's worth it
I'm going to try out a different kind of
beauty sponge and see how that works
this blends out your makeup beautifully
it soaks up all the excess moisture it's
very soft and it bounces on your skin
very lightly it just gives you the right
amount of coverage I'll just write out
my lips
we don't need lip color anyway and now
I'm going to go on to so the more
affordable side so the Marc Jacobs
foundation is $55 and the Beauty Blender
is $20 so I think it's worth it so far
let's see if the other side can compare
got something in my mouth most likely
it's hair my hair for my head so I'm
going to compare this full coverage
foundation to the Revlon full coverage
Colorstay foundation this was one that I
used all the time in my high school days
and it seemed to work really well for me
it was kind of my go-to and I loved full
coverage then just as much as I do now
I'm going to use the Real Techniques
Beauty sponge to apply it
and let's see if we can tell the
difference
well this sponge a little bit stiff
feeling this is full coverage but it's
not as full coverage as the Marc Jacobs
one and it's covering up a good amount
of my redness and my blemishes this one
is actually a little bit more dewy
feeling than the other one it's not as
thick okay so now it's the concealers
turn to bottle it out which concealer is
the best so I'm going to be using the
NARS radiant creamy concealer in custard
here I like this concealer mostly
because of the way it sits on my skin I
like that it goes on smooth and creamy
and it just blends out so nicely it
doesn't feel heavy or thick on my skin
and it covers the under eye circles
really really well so for the drugstore
side I'm using the Rimmel match
perfection and it comes with a little
applicator so I'm going to use the
applicator Boop this one feels a little
bit heavier on the skin then the NARS
creamy concealer but it does a good job
at concealing my circles it kind of has
a kinky undertone that I'm not crazy
about this one has more of a yellow
undertone which I really like but with
drugstores you're always going to find a
lot of the concealers and foundations
you have a little bit of a pinky
undertone it still covers the under-eye
circles
pretty well okay so next I'm going to go
into the eyes the eye brows I have a
little eyebrow palette from Rimmel this
is brow this way it's a brow sculpting
kit and then I have on this side makeup
forever
Pro sculpting brow palette first I'm
going to do the makeup forever side this
has the brow powders on one side and
then it has a brow gel and then a
highlight for your brow bone and so I'm
going to take the two brow colors on
this side and then dip a little bit of
that brow gel in there just so that it
acts as like a pomade and I
going to fill in my brows so that's one
eyebrow and this is the higher end brow
I like the fact that they have three
different shades like so I can kind of
play around and find my own brow shade
but let's go ahead and try the Rimmel
but what is it
Rimmel brow this way brow sculpting kit
this one doesn't have a mirror so I'm
going to go back to this little guy to
use a smear okay I'm going to say that
this the hold on the brow this way is
very in time okay so next I'm going to
get into the eye shadow I'm really
excited about this part because you are
gonna save so much money so much money
when I saw the shades that I'm using and
comparing I was like oh my god insane
this isn't drugstore but it is a more
affordable brand that I really like
using this is the morphe 3/5 35f palette
great for fall looks it's a lot of warm
neutral tone shades I took this palette
and I saw a few shades of math single
shadows that are way more expensive than
the entire palette and the first shade
that I'm going to be comparing is this
one right here the shade I'm going to
compare to are you ready
it's insane Mac's soft brown look at how
identical these shades are this palette
is $22 this eyeshadow one eyeshadow is
$16 that is crazy so I'm going to start
off with the Mac side or the high higher
inside so I'm going to take my morphe M
505 brush to work that into my crease
and start to blend it in there I'm going
to also work it down onto the lid when I
saw this I was like oh my gosh this is a
lifesaver so now I'm going to take the
morphe 35n shade I'm going to take this
shade right here and I'm using a morphe
504 brush to do this one why am i
holding it like this the same color
that's crazy
it's the exact same color I'm gonna take
max oh my mocha you see it it's a frosty
shade to frost the eyeshadow and the dew
is right here crazy and I'm going to
work that on my lid and then I'm going
to go ahead and go to the other eye with
a different brush and I'm just going to
take this other brushes and map to 13
and I'm going to go into the dippy shade
right there I'm going to pack it on to
the drugstore side so yeah that looks
the exact same
I'm going to be using this shade right
here with a max Naked Lunch to work
Naked Lunch onto the inner corners and
then for the dupe I'm going to take this
shade right here
okay so if you just a tip you guys I
cannot find another eye pencil brush so
just a tip in case you guys have an
eyeshadow brush that you want to use but
it has a shade on it and you want to
change the color a hack for that is to
use tape like scotch tape you can just
get the scotch tape rub it around and it
will take off the first layer of color
so I'm going to take this tape right
here and just put it on the back of my
hand and then I'm just going to clean my
brush so you know I shadow on it that's
off so I'm going to go ahead and take
this shade right here pop that into the
inner corner of my drugstore side that
is very pigmented or I'm going to darken
up the outer crease I'm going to use
Mac's carbon
and then for the other side I'm going to
take this black eyeshadow right here in
the palette this morphe 35o palette
against these Mac eyeshadows which would
add up to so much more money than this
palette I mean it's insane for the
high-end side I'm going to be using
Lancome's art liner actually didn't
think I was going to like this brush and
it ended up being super easy to apply my
eyeliner it it wasn't hard at all and on
this item of using the l'oreal intense
liner it has a felt tip just like the
other guy and we are going to do another
wing on this I think the eyeliners are
very much identical these guys are the
same eyeliner come on same tip same
everything even when you take it out
it's the exact same brush you guys the
exact same brush so the next thing we're
getting into is the lash mascara for
mascara I'm using a Lancome's
pictures know what is the Hypnose drama
I'm using the Lancome Hypnose drama
mascara
so I'm going to go ahead and take the
L'Oreal voluminous original mask air and
the reason I'm taking this one is
because it has that same soft feel as
the lip no drama from Lancome and it has
like it a little bit of a curve to the
brush like it too so I was like okay
let's see how these guys okay so we are
back I'm going to go ahead and put on
some bronzer for the bronzer on the
high-end side I'm going to take the Too
Faced milk chocolate Soleil bronzer got
a niche for me I feel like the dupe for
that is fit nice 320 it's just a powder
and it's the exact same shade as the as
the milk chocolate and let's see the
blush I'm going to be putting on Bobbi
Brown's nectar blush on this Sun oh oh
my god and then on the cheaper side I'm
going to put on the NYX blush and coral
dream looks like that okay so for the
lips I'm going to be using the Kylie
matte liquid lipstick and brown sugar
and I'm into that
and on the other side I'm going to be
using colourpop's point zero ultra satin
lip the lips dry the same pretty much
but this is a little bit more on the
cool tone side thank you guys for
