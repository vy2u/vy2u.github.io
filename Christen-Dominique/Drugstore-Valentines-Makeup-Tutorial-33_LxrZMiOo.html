and just saw last minute I know she
likes the holidays and I know she's
gonna look good for me today so I have
to find a good spot oh there you go hey
guys I hope you enjoyed that intro of
Caesar and I if you did thumbs it up and
I'll talk of Caesar a round of applause
because he did such a good job I'm going
to show you how to look and feel festive
on your Valentine's date without
literally looking like the holidays on
your face which honestly sometimes I
think it's cute but let's face it our
guy's not so much
I'm going to start off by priming my
face I'm going to use the maybelline
baby skin the instant pore eraser lost
the cap I'm going to take some of it on
my hand and just Pat it into my skin the
skin could look super smooth and
flawless okay let me find my cap also I
want to try this first base primer by
NYX I'm in a double prime it and it's a
spray so I was just interested on how
this is going to work so so now I'm
going to do my foundation the foundation
I'm using today I'm super excited to use
it it's the Maybelline Dream velvet soft
matte hydrating foundation so this is
creamy natural and I also brought 75
which is natural beige because I'm not
really sure which color I am I'm
probably in the middle somewhere so I
just brought both of them so let's try
the creamy natural and see how that
works out
then I have my Beauty Blender I just
washed it this morning nice and fresh
it's a little bit lighter than what I'd
like so I'm just going to add a little
bit of the natural beige 75 right here
oh yeah I think that's going to be a lot
better
I'm gonna do my concealer under eyes and
kind of highlight with it too so this is
the LA girl Pro conceal and this is
natural and to take a little bit on my
hand and then blend in with my finger
and I'm going to take it really close to
the inner corner just actually write all
over the top of the inner corner this is
so dark in that area for me and I want
my skin to look fresh especially around
this area so I'm just going to take it
there and then all the way down to the
end of the nose and bring it all the way
out towards the tops of the cheekbones
I'm going to go ahead and do my eyebrows
off-camera
I'll be back and we're gonna do our eye
shadow we're going to do our eye shadow
all right I'll be back so I'm going to
use this NYC love Audax by Demi palette
and it is awesome at doing any look from
day to night so that's why I chose this
one right here so I'm gonna go ahead and
start with this shade this taupe shade
in the center so I'm going to pick up a
little bit of this shade and work it
into the crease with my zoeva 224 luxe
defined crease brush I'm going to focus
this color right on the center of the
crease so that's where we're going to
draw more attention and have add more
depth and then with a very light hand
I'm just going to feather out the edges
so this palette doesn't name its shadows
but if I were to name this shade it
would be pink champagne because that's
what it reminds me of it's a very light
shimmering pink and it's just beautiful
makes your eye color pop so I'm going to
place that all over my lid and even go
into the inner corners with it now I'm
going to go in with this darker shade of
matte Brown but I'm going to focus this
one on the outer part of the crease it's
just going to add another layer of
dimension to your eye and really
accentuate the natural contours of your
eyes and I think that's what guys like
just for you to be natural or not look
naturally enhanced you know with makeup
but if you want to be festive you can
use the pink and feel like oh this is
pink Valentine girly but you know I
would avoid using red glitter like I did
in the beginning or you know headbands
with heart that might scare him away you
know for good for the eyeliner I want it
to look soft and flirty so I'm going to
take it down a few notches I'm going to
use a pencil and then I'm going to use
mainly the winged liner brush to create
the wing and I'm just focusing it on the
end of the eye I'm not going to bring it
in all the way I'm going to fake it just
bring it in a little bit halfway and
then I'm just gonna curl my lashes and
apply some mascara we're leaving that
inner part open because it's still your
natural shape and it doesn't take away
from that but it still adds that flirty
touch to it
you can stop at the loop at the mascara
but I decided to put some lashes on so I
just finished my eye shadow I'm gonna
put on some lashes and I'll be right
back this is why I choose lashes just
saying my name is this NYX sculpting
highlight knees under my eyes
by the way guys this formula is super
lightweight and very easy to blend so it
doesn't feel heavy thick or or cakey on
your skin you know so I really really
liked the formula it's like I'm tapping
in air on my face literally truly it's
super super light and then when I got to
the contour part like right here
I'm just accentuating my my cheekbones
and slimming down the front of my nose I
was like oh my god
this is the perfect natural contour that
I have been looking for for I don't even
know how long
honestly this is so natural and perfect
for my skin tone if you guys are out you
need to get this NYX highlight and
sculpt in this shade if your my my color
and then I'm just going back over the
contour areas to really add definition
there a subtle soft definition after a
cream I always like to enhance with the
powder I just feel like it's locked in
there now I'm just taking some blush and
just marrying the the contour and
highlight together
that's not enough flush and I went in
with that blush and then I just put some
highlight on my nose and my Cupid's bow
and this is what it looks like so fresh
and angelic or you least you could
pretend to be for that night for the
lips I'm taking Nyx's lip ombre lip duo
in freckles and speckles such a cute
name and I'm going to like naturally
line my lips I don't want to over line
them just accentuating their natural
shape and then I'm going to brighten up
the lip liner with a lighter side and
then gonna top off the entire lips with
the liquid lipstick and embellishment
from NYX and then with the butter gloss
I'm going to go ahead and just focus out
on the center of the lips to make them
look a little bit more pouty I hope you
