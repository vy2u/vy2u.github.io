channel so today I'm going to show you
how to give this a neutral cut crease
right here it is something that I
haven't done on my channel so I wanted
to do something a little different but
something that you can still wear out in
the day or just everyday colors I like
the bold precise lines I think it looks
really cool I hope you enjoyed this
video and don't forget to subscribe to
my channel I get the notification bell
so you can be one of the first people in
my comments because I am in my comments
in the first 30 minutes to an hour I'm
just sitting there replying back to you
guys and reading all your comments if
you want to be part of that squad well
go ahead and hit the notification bell
and if you want to learn how to get this
look then keep watching so I'm going to
start off with primer I'm going to be
using this one here from glossier
it's pour it's a priming moisturizer
this is what I'm going to do to prep my
face for foundation okay my eyes are
starting to water so this is not the
kind that you want to get in your eye
fYI my eyes are watering right now oh do
not get that in your eyes you guys this
burns oh now that my eyes are dry I'm
gonna put on some foundation so I'm just
going to do a light layer foundation so
that my skin looks even I'm using the
Estee Lauder Double Wear this is my
favorite full coverage foundation right
now I'm in tawny and I'm gonna try the
the makeup drop this is a silicone
sponge I don't know if I use this side
or this side
hmmm
this side feels a little bit more tacky
so I'm just going to go with the front
oh good night baby come here give me a
hug okay so I have it on my sponge and
we are going to work it into our face
I'm gonna put little dots all around and
then we'll work it in I'm gonna Pat it
in I wish it didn't have this like edge
on it because it kind of bugs my eyes a
little bit the only thing is it won't
soak up the excess foundation so it's
literally putting all the foundation on
your face
mmm I don't know I don't know if I
honestly probably wouldn't go back to
using this just because I don't know I
don't know how I feel about it
it makes like a weird smacking noise I
mean it works I just feel like I want to
use my Beauty Blender to soak up the
excess so I'm just gonna do that really
quick to use this every day I don't know
if I would do that because it's not it
isn't I mean I guess I'm not comfortable
with it but I mean I would still have to
go over it with a Beauty Blender so I
don't know maybe for Instagram videos
for fun I'll use it is that something I
would probably use everyday my brows
really quick off camera I'm gonna go
ahead and take this Too Faced semi-sweet
chocolate bar palette using these shades
and this one right here I'm going to
start off with nougat take this morphe
ma5 21 brush pick up some of this
coconut cream shade I'm going to pop it
all over the lid just so we don't get
any creasing it's smooth everything out
and set the the cream with this powder
and everything's just going to look a
little bit more vibrant and just pop out
a little bit more and it also will go on
a lot smoother so I'm going to put it
all the way up into the brow bone can
you tell I've been playing with my brow
shape lately I've been doing like
different brow shapes and it gets fun to
like change up your brow shade now we're
going to get into the crease for the
crease I'm gonna use this one this is
the M morphe M a 506 brush take some of
this shade right here nougat it's going
to go ahead and work it into the crease
this is going to be our first transition
shade these are the next clichéd I'm
going to go in with is moose it's the
shade right here work that as a second
crease color and the shade right here is
just a notch up from the first crease
shade we used it's still very subtle but
it's working your way to a really nice
dimensional crease okay so now I'm going
to go ahead and move on to the next
color I'm going to use this one here
it's called peanut butter start to work
that into the crease as well okay so the
next shade I'm going to take is truffled
this shade right here that's the deepest
Brown in the palette and I'm just going
to work it through the crease I'm going
to flick it out and if you're having a
hard time creating the shape you want
with your fluff with your brush don't
worry we're going to cut the crease so
nice and create the exact shape we want
with the next step that we do it's like
it'll never fail you if you want a nice
sharp cut crease with a wing it's gonna
look so good every time you do it
deepening on the crease you can even add
a black in there if you want it super
defined I'm gonna go in with a little
bit of a fluffier brush this is the
morphe 518 and I'm just going to soften
up the edges okay I'm going to use this
brush here from the makeup shock it's
the t2 brush and I'm gonna take this
same shade truffled but on a more
densely packed tight brush so it just
gives us more pigment and I'm going to
go ahead and start to line my crease out
with it so you just lays down more
product so it gives it a darker look
flip it on the clean side and then flick
the color upwards so that it kind of
blends in with the other shades we have
going on and I'm going to leave the
crease like this it looks kind of messy
but no worries because this trick is
going to be amazing so I'm going to do
is take this concealer right here
medium one custard from the soft matte
concealers and I'm taking the Mac 242
concealer brush I'm going to carve out
my crease with the concealer brush kind
of like your brows we're going to carve
out the crease so I'm just going to
start here and slowly kind of create the
crease if you don't have one you can
create it or just follow your natural
crease
it looks a little messy at first but it
ends up really really nice I promise
and that is basically how I cut my
crease and it's like your concealer does
everything for you and it's a perfectly
cut crease you want a yellow undertone
and this palette doesn't have what I'm
looking for so I'm going to take my
tartlet palette take the shadow right
here this is free spirit and I'm going
to pop on this shade with a Mac to 239
set this cream in place now I'm going to
create a wing right here I'm going to
use my Sigma wicked gel eyeliner just a
black gel liner and then this winged
liner brush I used to actually use this
Sigma yo six brush to do my brows it's
actually a really good brush to do your
brows with but ever since I found blink
I'm just like hooked right now
and then to clean up the liner I'm going
to take I'm going to dip my brush into
the concealer pot and just clean it up
so it's nice and sharp and then I'm
gonna put on some mascara and use this
one right here I've been using it for
like all my videos lately I'm just going
to coat my lashes and then pop on some
lashes oh by the way you guys I went
over the black eye line the gel liner
with this black shadow from the palette
it's called licorice and I just like
layered it on top so it looks super dark
now I'm gonna put on some lashes these
lashes right here from violet Voss I
started to take it off but then I was
like wait let me show them what it looks
like so looks like this there's some
like long and short pieces it's like
really PC it's really pretty I want it
that way that's a really long name for
eyelashes but I'm gonna go ahead and pop
these on and I will be right back so I
decided to clean up the brow bone and I
completely forgot I wasn't filming after
I put on my lashes I just basically made
my brow a little bit thicker and then I
went in with the same concealer actually
this is light 2.5 creme brulee okay so
that's pretty much it for the eyes I'm
going to go ahead and do the rest of my
face put on some concealer underneath my
eyes
actually I'll just put it all over the
areas that I'm highlighting actually I
just put it all over my days basically I
am doing the messiest contour right now
I don't know why cutting my cheeks I'm
gonna go ahead and blend my contour with
my Beauty Blender I'm going to go ahead
and set my under eyes so I'm going to
take the Kat Von D shade and light
palette and I'm going to use these two
colors right here work it outwards
towards the temple I'm going to take
this powder right here from coverfx pop
it underneath my under eyes so I'll let
that sit there and then I'm going to do
my lower lash line everything that we
did to the crease we're going to do to
the lower lash line and just run it down
the lower lash line so I'm just going to
go ahead and remove the excess powder
now if your bronzer lately I've been
using the Estee Lauder and that's like
the Victoria Beckham Estee Lauder
bronzer and I don't know I just love
this shade of this bronzer and I feel
like it just gives you a really nice
glow it's also matte and we'll work this
bronzer on my cheeks and just doing
circular motions going back and forth
and sweeping it into the hairline and
then I'm going to bring it up across the
temple and then for blush I'm going to
use this one right here this is the
makeup geek blush in rendezvous I'm
going to take some of that and work it
onto my cheeks like so I'm going to take
this highlight from what is this and
anastasiya this is champagne and work
this in with my finger on my nose it's a
little bit right there I feel like these
highlights are a little bit more natural
looking and I don't want anything too
crazy so I'm just going to pop it on
right there just accentuate my new nose
that I created takes this brush right
here some more feet M 5 10 equal
you just got these bite Beauty lip
liners in so this one right here this is
number 22 and then for the lips I'm
going to use the tarte rainforest of the
sea lipstick and this is in the shade
colada just a really pretty nude shade
and I'm going to put it on my lips thank
