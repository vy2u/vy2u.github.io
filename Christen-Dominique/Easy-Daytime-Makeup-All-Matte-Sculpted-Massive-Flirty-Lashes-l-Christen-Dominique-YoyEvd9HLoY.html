again and today we're doing this soft
matte mauve II look that I have on my
face right now and if you want to know
how I got it then keep watching BAM
before we begin I just want to let you
know that I'm eating this grapefruit not
coffee usually I start my mornings off
with coffee a bunch of creamer and sugar
and I'm not doing that today so this is
a big deal
this is a grapefruit now I just hate
that grapefruit back into the makeup
okay
so I'm going to use the Porefessional
primer on my face to close my pores
actually put that on my nose cheeks and
right in there
okay so now that my pores are all closed
I'm going to take to Phase two hangover
RX which is another primer that is
silicone free it's a lot thinner but
it's going to make your foundation look
a lot smoother I'm going to put this on
the outer parts of my face
feel like I have a lot of hair going on
I have extensions on for like the first
time in a really long time actually so I
want to show them off to you guys but at
the same time I feel like I just have so
much hair but they look really pretty
there from foxy locks and they match
perfectly I love a bit there I think
that's the right amount of here after my
primer we're going to start on the
foundation right because that's what you
do and today I'm using Smashbox Studios
skin the and this is in the color 2.4
I'm just going to put some on my hand
take my foundation brush this is this is
from zoeva it's the 107 a powder polish
brush I'm just going to evenly apply
that all over my face and down my neck
I've been using the booboo cover-up
concealer and it's one of those
concealers where it exceeds your
expectations coverage is about medium
and it easily blends into your skin I
like that it brightens my under eye area
without creasing and it kind of acts as
a highlight if I don't want to put a
highlighter on that day
as this foundation and concealer dry I'm
going to go ahead and do my brows and do
that off-camera you guys want an updated
brow routine let me know I'll just make
a specific video for the brows but I'm
going to do that off camera come back
and work on the rest of my face in my
eyes just at my foundation today I'm
going to use the Smashbox powder and big
fluffy brush from bare minerals and just
apply that on top of my foundation I'm
going to contour a little bit I'm just
taking the contour and bronze and kind
of chiseling out my cheek bone
this quick little contour that I'm doing
I do it it's like it never changes
hasn't changed so far I haven't found
another contour that I really love so um
if you guys want me to do a separate
video for this too I can just let me
know in the comments below and if I get
enough comments then I'll make a video
for you guys so that you can refer back
to it when I don't show you how I do my
contour in just like a regular video so
let me know I'm already almost done with
my nose contour and this is just like on
a regular basis this is part of like my
foundation routine alrighty so now that
we're all contoured contoured right now
so I've been really into it lip glosses
lately and this up today I'm trying the
Kaelyn extreme matte lip tints and this
one here is in the color narcissist it's
a warm bright pink color I'm going to
swatch that for you and it dries matte
and what I like about it is that it's
not sticky and then I also have this one
here and this one is in the color
illusionist I'm going to use illusionist
which is the darker color I'm going to
try a darker lip today and go around
that color
it feels very velvety if I really love a
lip color sometimes I'll just put that
on first and it helps me figure out what
colors to use on my eyes so for my eyes
today I'm going to be using this it
cosmetics naturally pretty celebration
palette picking up miracle has like a
orange undertone to it which I really
like
for the crease and I'm just going to
sweep that back and forth along the
crease with a zoeva 224 brush next i'm
picking up piece and applying this to
the outer half of the lid using light
short strokes as i blend towards the
center of the lid still leaving the
inner half open and pretty naked to
intensify the outer part of the crease
i'm going to pick up hot coco which is
this matte chocolate brown and work that
into the outer V area even if it's like
a little messy it doesn't matter because
we're gonna blend it out with a blending
brush till I like the amount and then it
gets like this then I take my blending
brush just to blend it upwards towards
the brow bone
and here I'm just building up the
intensity as I go and just dipping back
into the hot chocolate and blending
until I like the way it looks
now I'm going to pick up snow angel and
apply that to the inner part of the lid
you want to use anything that's very
similar to your natural skin tone this
obviously came out a little bit too
strong for me so I just took a big
blending brush and blended some of the
product away and it actually worked out
pretty well so on the other part of my
eye I just use less of the product and
then I blended it bled they did it and
then I blended it into blended how do
you say that blended then I blended it
into the other colors for my brow bone
highlight I'm using the radiance ribbon
and I'm just going to apply that right
below my brow and blending it downwards
into the other colors so that it
transitions nicely and everything looks
soft and blended next I'm going to pick
up hot cocoa and just run it on the
outer part of the lower lash line so I
decided to skip on the winged liner
today and I'm going to go straight for
the mascara and lashes today I'm using
the Smashbox photo op eye brightening
mascara illuminator next I'm going to
pop on these lashes from foxy locks and
these are in lovely lashes so this is
the finished eye look so now I'm going
to move on to highlighting in some blush
I'm going to brighten my under eyes a
little bit more lately I've been using
this eye shadow as an under eye
brightener
for blush today I'm going to use the in
stain oh this is so cute it's from the
balm it's called what is it called
Argyle and it's a blush it's super cute
it looks like a magazine cover I'm just
going to apply that to the apples of my
cheeks using my 126 zoeva cheek brush so
