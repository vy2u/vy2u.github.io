going to show you on my intro or in the
video so I'm going to go ahead and show
you guys I went on periscope this
morning before I actually filmed so if
you guys haven't added me on periscope
you might want to do so because you'll
definitely get a lot of behind the
scenes look into my life - today I am
doing a super quick and easy makeup look
this is great you're going back to
school if you're a mom on the go this is
perfect for you because it's very easy
and you don't have to use many like
tools so you can just use your hands for
most of the stuff in this video so if
you like this look it's actually super
simple so if you like it then keep
watching to prime your face but if you
want your makeup to last all day and not
kind of slide off then definitely don't
skip on the primer today I'm using the
cover FX mattifying primer if you have
oily skin this is awesome or if you have
large pores it smooths out the surface
and today I'm going to be using my
fingers a lot because when I'm on the go
I don't I don't grab brushes or sponges
I just use my fingers the quickest way
to get an even skin tone is using a
stick foundation it's just so easy and
so simple I usually just do like three
marks here here you can go crazy with it
and then just smooth it in with your
fingers using your hands will also help
the foundation melt into your skin a lot
easier
and then for concealer today I'm using
the NYX color correcting concealer it
has all these different colors in it so
you can use whatever you want for
redness use the green one for under-eye
circles I'm using the salmon color in
this this color right here and then I'm
going to place them right under my eyes
really quick if you have time to contour
I would use a contouring stick this one
is from nude Stix it's a sculpting
pencil so one side is contours one is
highlight and the shade is medium so I'm
going to use this right where my
cheekbones are down the nose my name
places to contour or just right under my
cheekbones and my nose and then just
blend it in with your finger and then
with the highlight just go down your
nose the center of your forehead lip
and then for my brows I'm just going to
take in eyes shadow palette that I'm
using today and it has a darker Brown in
it
so I'm just going to do a little bit of
this on my sparse areas for my crease
I'm going to use a bronzer because it's
easy to do you don't have to reach for
many products just use bronzer on the
crease to add some depth
to make my eyes look awake I'm going to
use this angel magnetic eye color from
nude Stix and when I'm using a contour
powder for my eyes or very light shades
of eyeshadows I like to take a darker
Brown just to go into the crease and
intensify it a little bit and then I'm
going to go in with my dark brown gel
pen and just make a wing I honestly was
going to just do the brown and that was
it but then I got a black and I started
playing with it just to intensify really
close to the lash line and basically my
entire wing became black so it's black
now so it's up to you if you want to do
brown or black and then I'm going over
with some mascara I'm using the better
than sex mascara to plump up my lashes
so for my powder I'm using cargo and
this is in the number 25 just to set
everything in place for that I'm using
this one for a manic Adar this has been
c3
I'm gonna take some bronzer and just
apply it to the perimeters of my face I
basically just want to add some color
and I'm just gonna put it on my
cheekbones temples and around my jawline
so you can totally skip on this part but
if you want to add a little bit more
color to your face go ahead and apply a
blush here I'm using the Tarte
captivated blush so for my lips I'm
using the buxom full-on lipstick I like
this one because it has a pointed tip on
it and you can line your lips and then
then you can just use the sides to it on
the lipstick so that's what I'm going to
do right now just if I want to over line
my lip a little bit I'm going to do that
and then with a chubbier
I'm just gonna fill it in
