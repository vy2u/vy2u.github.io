hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today I'm gonna be doing this fresh
super glowy makeup it's been a little
bit a lot of bit of an obsession of mine
to highlight my face lately so I wanted
to create a look around my obsession
that you can wear every day hashtag that
glow though I hope you guys enjoy the
video if you want to learn how to get
this look then keep watching before I
start applying my foundation I'm going
to put on this Mac prep and prime I feel
like it helps it stick on there and
lasts pretty long and then it also helps
with the luminosity or my primer I'm
using the Too Faced hangover RX right
here and this has coconut water in it so
it's super hydrating the foundation that
I'm going to use today is the Make Up
For Ever Ultra HD foundation I am in why
335 i like this cuz it's like super easy
to put on and it's full coverage card
everything so that guy right there go on
your eyes everything so if you want a
quick fix for your skin you're trying to
get out the door this is one of those
foundations that will do it quick and
easy for you here's a before and after
it's amazing so now I'm going to move on
to my brows I'm outlining my brows with
the dip brow from honest Asya this is in
ash brown and then I'm going to fill
them in with you brow definer in
chocolate and then I'm going to set the
brows with the Urban Decay Gwen Stefani
brow powder the packaging just has my
heart because it matches my office so
well I feel like it should be a
decoration which actually it is I'm
looking at it right now so that our
brows have a clean perfect arch I'm
going to go ahead and take some
concealer draw underneath the brows and
then drag it down and then I'm going to
go ahead and take my ring finger and
just or any finger that's clean and just
dab it into the skin and I'm taking soft
ochre by Mac and just prepping all over
the eyes so now that the eyelid is
pretty even I'm going to go ahead and
use this self-made palette from
Australia taking the shadow right here I
feel like it brightens up the eyes from
underneath and then I'm using this super
cute brush from SL miss glam Beauty she
also has like a pink set of brushes and
I think you're adorable I'm just gonna
Pat that all over the lid
make sure that eyes look fresh and
bright I have the darkest part of my eye
in my inner corner so I'm really packing
on the shadow there and then I'm going
to go in with this little eyeshadow duo
from pixi by petra and this is in
lavender blue and I'm going to take this
lavender shade right here and work that
into the crease this brush fits
perfectly in the crease because it's so
tapered this one is the w24 and then I'm
going to take sherbert and I'm going to
work that into the crease as well I love
how this shadow has a pearly finish to
it so I'm gonna go ahead and drag it
down all the way to my lid you know what
we're gonna be glowing from all parts of
our face today we're going to look like
pretty disco ball in a good way so now
I'm going to take Coco bear from makeup
geek it's like an orange e brown shade
has a matte finish it's beautiful I'm
going to go ahead and work it on to the
outer parts of my lid and crease can't
forget the crease and then I'm going to
go ahead and work it down to the lower
part of my lash line so now I'm going to
go back in with buttery and I'm gonna
put it on to the inner part of my lid
and the brow bone this is gonna make
your eyes just look so fresh and awake I
love that yellow undertone it has I'm
gonna bling up my inner corners I'm
gonna use this artist Couture diamond
powder and conceited now I'm gonna go
ahead and do my wing my everyday wing I
always get asked which eyeliner I use
it's this one right here from Kat Von D
tattoo liner in trooper it just goes on
so smooth and then if I mess up I'll
just take some of these eye makeup wipes
with a concealer and then i'ma curl my
lashes prep them for mascara and the
mascara I'm using today's from Marc
Jacobs packaging is always so beautiful
a formula is really nice and light if
that makes sense it just separates and
it doesn't feel really heavy on your
lashes alright so for my lashes I'm
gonna put together two super natural
lashes these are my this one's my
favorite this one I just got and just
trying but I figured both of them
together would make a nice full but
natural look so this one is from foxy
locks this is in perfect lash and then I
have this one from house of lashes in
all natural so I'm going to put them
both together so I'm just gonna pop them
on right here and then I want to stop
and show you the difference because it's
so natural but fluffy and pretty I just
of the mixture that I made with these
lashes here I'm just binding the false
and real lash together and then just
covering up any glue marks so now that
we're done with the eyes I'm going to go
ahead and conceal my under eyes and then
contour I'm going to be using the Make
Up For Ever Ultra HD corrector and
concealer I'm going to use this one
first this is the r40 it's like a salmon
color this is going to help cancel the
Panda eye
I actually did a video with makeup
forever it's on Sephora and the Make Up
For Ever website which is super cool
so if you guys wanna check it out I'll
link it below and then on top of it use
r22 and that's to conceal as you can see
I went a little crazy on the concealer
sites with my Beauty Blender to soak up
the excess to contour my face I'm going
to use the anastacio cream contour
palette and this is a more feet 14 got a
wrapper a 50 brush I'm going to use this
for the contour so when I'm doing my
makeup I always like to make sure that I
have a white next to me cuz I use my
fingers a lot they are your best tool
one of my all-time favorite powders
besides the Kat Von D one it makes your
skin look so flawless this is the ultra
definition Naked skin powder
so I am also going to contour on top of
my contour just to make sure everything
is super defined and I'm taking the
Elizabeth Mott contour palette and just
going over the areas I've already kind
of mapped out and then for the under
eyes and the you know highlighted parts
of my face I'm going to use the yellow
wheat powders I'm going to use
spellbound for my cheeks I'm just gonna
put it on the apples and sweep it back
into the hairline just to give a natural
flush of color and then I'm gonna go in
with my glow kit I'm excited I'm gonna
use crushed pearl this one this is a new
brush that came in from zoeva it's the
143 powder fusion I'm going to take this
brush right here and I'm gonna work that
on top of my cheekbones I'm also going
to take it on top of my nose my Cupid's
bow and the brow bone on both sides of
course yeah
then I use the Gwen Stefani
ex-girlfriend lip liner isn't your
packaging amazing I still want that
bright highlight right in the center to
show some nigga right underneath so
after I lined my lips I'm gonna fill
them in and this lip liner is so buttery
and goes on so smooth just putting it
out there it's buttery and I like it
this is the Jeffrey star oh boy
liquid lipstick in I'm you'd this is
another packaging that I think is super
cute it's so pigmented that I'm just
gonna pop it onto the center and then
blend it out with my finger and then the
highlight we used earlier I'm going to
brush it on to the top of the Cupid's
bow and on the center of the lips and
voila
