today I'm gonna be doing this look with
the chocolate bon bons palette this is
one of the newest palettes from Too
Faced it actually hasn't came out yet
and it's coming out in five weeks giving
away five of these so if you want to
learn how to win it then go ahead and
check the description box I'm super
excited to give it away to you guys link
is going to be there so you can enter
and win this awesome palette it smells
just like all the other chocolate
palettes I'm excited for you guys and
this hair style it happened in a hair
tutorial in a really long time this is
just like my everyday big waves so if
you want to learn how to get this look
that I've created for you guys today
then keep watching first I'm going to
start off with primer I got this primer
and yesterday from Marc Jacobs this is
called the invisible under cover and
it's made with coconut water smells
really really good to put this on it's
super hydrating I love the bottle it's
so pretty so if you missed your
moisturizer this is gonna work in place
of that ooh my skin feels really silky
so okay very nice okay so for foundation
I'm going to be using I've been using
the Make Up For Ever HD Ultra HD
foundation stick and this one is in y3
3/5 boba kept me up last night she wakes
up during the time that we're sleeping
so she was just like purring the whole
time curled up next to my face but it
was cute I have really dark bags under
my eyes right now she usually sleeps
during the day and then she'll wake up
at like 2 o'clock in the morning and
ready to play
next I'm going to take my mac
prolongwear this is in NC 25 I'm going
to use this underneath my eyes and just
to conceal the dark areas of my face now
that we're done covering up our panda
eyes I'm going to move on to the eye
shadow I'm going to save the face for
later so I'm going to be using the Too
Faced chocolate bon bons palette for
this entire look I'm using mocha right
here this is a very light topi shade
this color you barely can even tell that
I have it on but it makes a big
difference when you're done with your
eye shadow you'll notice that it's
easily blending together and if you're
not that great at blending this is a
awesome trick just use a lighter shadow
and then just layer on that so now I'm
using mocha Bordeaux Bordeaux is like a
reddish brown it's one of my favorites
for the crease I'm just going to focus
this on the outer part of the crease at
first and then softly blend it inwards
towards the nose area and you can tell
that I'm starting off very light and
then I gradually start to intensify the
outer part of the crease and that's
because I don't want to start off too
strong because then I'll look like I
have two reddish-brown bruised eyes but
that's why I'm starting off a very light
and then I intensify it later once I
have the intensity that I want I'm going
to take a blending brush and I'm going
to blend upwards towards the brows so
that the edges are nice and soft
next time I'd be picking up cotton candy
it's light pale pink color it's very
pretty and super pigmented as you can
tell I like barely padded one little
swipe down and it was like BAM right on
your eyes awesome it's a really really
pretty color and then I'm going to take
this one this is called so fetch and
it's a hot pink I decided to use that in
the inner corners you know mix it up a
little bit do something different I was
going to use like a lighter shade but I
was like no let's do hot pink and then I
went ahead and brought down a board go
to the second half of the lid because I
feel like I just needed more intensity
so I'm going to be doing that you can do
this too or you can say how we had it
and then I'm taking black currant and
it's a very beautiful purple I'm going
to layer this on the lower half of the
bottom lash line so now I'm going to
take this matte cream color it kind of
reminds me of like the off-white of a
s'more I don't know why s'mores I don't
know am i hungry
and then I'm going to apply it to my
brow bone and then I'm going to take a
black eyeliner this one's from Lancome
and it's super intense apply that to my
waterline and then I'm going to make a
wing on the top lashline and here I'm
using this makeup forever graphic liner
to do that and what am i doing I'm
intensifying that wing and elongated the
liner so these two mascaras have been my
favorite this is the it cosmetics hello
lash mascara and it just separates and
makes them super long and then I'm
taking the Too Faced mascara which makes
them really a voluminous and fluffy so
next I'm taking my Lily lashes these are
in Miami
they're super like lightweight and
natural-looking but they're very
dramatic if that makes sense what I do
is just pop them on to the center so
that I know they're not hanging off at a
weird angle and then I attach one side
at a time
so I've done with the eyes but I
actually decided that I should go back
in with this pink shade right here I'm
going to mix this reddish brown and then
totally fetch so I'm going to mix this
one and this one together and I'm going
to focus that on the outer part of the
crease like right in here
that's pretty so the powder I'm going to
be using today is from urban decay this
is medium light cool this is going to
give you more coverage and also mattify
your face I like to start with most of
the powder on the outer part of the face
and then blend that down into the neck
before I go everywhere else so I'm going
to do a little bit of baking but today
I'm just going to keep it right
underneath the cheekbone I'll let it sit
there for like a few minutes and this is
going to help the contour really pop
okay I just used five different
highlights I might as well tell you what
I used it's on this brush by
highlighting the lightening powder this
one is from Anna kadar this is in c3
banana from Anastasia just this one from
the contour kit and then a little bit of
Kat Von D's contour palette just these
two so just like dip my brush into all
of them you don't have to do that but
that is what I'm doing and I feel like
I'm cheating you guys if I don't tell
you all of the highlights I'm using so
I'm just going to put that underneath my
under eyes and center of the forehead
and on the chin a little bit
all right it's time to contour our face
I'm going to use my Kat Von D palette to
contour and this big paddle brush from
Tarte I'm going to do the hollows of the
cheekbones temples this is my instant
face slimmer so now I'm just going to
make the illusion of a more symmetrical
straight nose so I'm gonna go along the
sides of my nose and also towards the
tip I'm going to make sure that it's
like coming inwards so that it looks a
little bit more thin and then I'm going
to take infatuated which is a really
pretty peach blush from makeup geek and
I'm going to apply that to my cheekbones
and also I'm going to kind of go up
towards the temples okay so you're going
to think I'm a little crazy but I'm
using two lip liners and they're almost
the same color but trust me it makes a
difference I'm gonna start off with
stone so you have chola lips at first
but we're gonna blend everything out and
it's gonna look good trust me when I
over line my lips so they look a little
bit fuller and then I'm gonna take
Agatha this is a matte lipstick from Kat
Von D it's a peachy nude color and it's
one of my favorites after that I'm going
to take stripped down which is this lip
pencil right here and I'm going to layer
this on top of the stone but the stone
is still going to peak through and I'm
taking the liquid lipstick from honest
Asya in milkshake and I'm focusing
focusing it on the center and then
blending it outward so that most of the
intensity is on the center of the lips
so this is the final makeup look next
I'm gonna just do my hair really quick
and I'm also gonna put an extension so
I'm going to put my hair half way up and
then do some waves with it with the wand
these are all of the extensions I
brought them together I just clip them
all together I'm just going to take one
of these guys or two and clip them in
while it's like this like halfway down
and usually take the ones that are like
three or four clips this is where the
longest ones these are from a luxy hair
these are the dirty blonde
20 inch hair extensions and then just
pop them in the back so I'm just taking
a little bit of hair like this and
wrapping it around the middle holding it
there and then let it go so gonna look
like this most of the body is going to
be right here in the middle thanks Cesar
said something weirds eyes are smiling
I'm going to do the same thing all
around the head that's why I'm here with
my first layer all done and then I take
down another layer and then put down
this clip in extension just for three
clippings I have a ton of fullness and
what is that I don't know what happens
and then I take down the top part of my
hair it curl outwards and do the same
thing all around the head I'm at the
bangs now and it's pretty much done I
just fluff it up kind of tease it a
little bit and voila this is the
completed look I hope you guys enjoyed
