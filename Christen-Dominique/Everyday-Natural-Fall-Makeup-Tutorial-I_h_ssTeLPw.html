oh my god I can't even make sense hey
guys welcome back to my channel so today
I'm gonna be doing this everyday fall
and natural makeup look right here I
feel like there's so many bold looks
going around right now and especially
with the autumn season but I wanted to
throw something in there that's a little
bit more natural and everyday that you
can wear in between the Halloween
costumes and the bold lips and the bold
eyes something that's more wearable I
just decided to mix it up a little bit
and add a cool tone book on my eyes and
then I added the kylie lip the new kylie
lip in autumn I mixed it with a little
bit of the new Kylie liquid lip in Libra
and I created this look right here I
think it's very fresh and full and
beautiful and somebody can wear this
like every single day yes purple is not
natural lashes are not natural but they
are minor you can take little pieces
from here customize it to your own look
let me know how it works out for you tag
me on your pictures and comment below if
you decide to do something like this
isn't that make me really happy but
anyways if you want to learn how to get
this look don't forget to subscribe to
my channel and you hit that notification
about so you can be a part of the quad
family and without further ado let's get
on with this video okay just drop my
makeup off
I'm gonna use my brow pencil from
Anastasia this is the brow Wiz in dark
brown I'm just gonna fill them in just
following the natural shape this is
something that this is like a brow that
I would do every day on a normal basis I
like them looking a little bit more
natural these days so like when it comes
to right underneath the brow I just make
sure that there's no harsh line right
underneath there just that looks more
effortlessly natural to star you gotta
sneeze lately I like to leave a little
bit of space in between my brows it just
gives it this undone imperfect look that
I loved before primer I'm going to use
the Laura Mercier foundation primer
right here a hydrating primer you know
how I feel about hydrating primers I
love them oh my god this is
like putting on a hydrating face cream
more so than a primer I like the
thickness of this primer it's not too
thick it's just enough to where your if
you feel like your your skin is quenched
like your skin is drinking a glass of
water and right on my t-zone I'm gonna
take the Porefessional from benefit to
help fill in those pores those large
pores this is actually a birthmark that
I have you can see this professional oh
my gosh look at it blurs all the pores
out g-way just came out with a new
foundation it's this one right here it's
the essential high coverage cream
foundation it has hyaluronic acid in it
also it dries matte and it's supposed to
be oil-free so it's good for you guys
out there who have oily skin but it's
supposed to be lightweight enough so you
don't feel like you're your pores are
being clogged and you can't breathe just
because my skin is really dry I like to
make sure that it looks as hydrated and
plump as possible and nothing settles
into the fine lines this is supposed to
be very lightweight so let's see how
this works on our skin today on my skin
today this is the shade latte so I'm
gonna take that on the back of my hand
and I'm gonna mix in almond with it just
just a tad bit lighter so that might be
a little bit too dark for me I'm gonna
put in a little bit more of the almond
shade and mix that into my skin
immediately it covered up everything
just like a cake a foundation I'm not in
a bad way just covered up all of the
imperfections so quickly so you probably
don't eat as much as I put on my hand it
covered up my veins you can cover up
tattoos with this my green veins are
gone that is crazy I'm gonna work this
down into my neck so everything matches
make sure you get underneath your choker
you don't look like your heads
disconnected wow this is definitely full
coverage foundation it doesn't feel
thick at all which is cool but it's
intense
the only thing about foundations that
dry matte that I've noticed recently on
my skin is that they settle in to my
pores and little tiny lines and so when
I do wear these types of foundations
I won't set it I don't care if I go
about my day and it kind of wears off
there at the day if I'm about myself I
don't mind that I'm still studying my
under-eye
I'm not setting the entire face because
I will look like a extreme cake face I
feel like you don't need very many
layers of this foundation once it's on
your skin it's it does the job pretty
quick I'm just gonna use my foundation
as a base
make sure there's no lines I want to use
the new Kiley purple eyeshadow kit that
one's called the Chi shadow kit I want
to use this it's so beautiful and it has
those like everyday fall looking colors
I'm gonna go ahead and take stone which
is this color right here I'm gonna grab
it with my Luxy brush this is the Luxy
231 small tapered blending brush so I
wanted to create something that we can
do every day it doesn't have to be super
bold go ahead and blend this out in my
crease I really like this as a crease
color and an option for somebody who
doesn't like to put a ton of eyeshadow
on every day as their everyday look is
just taking an eyeshadow color and just
washing it on your lid up into the
crease you can use a brush you can use
your finger whatever you think works
best for you and you don't have to
always do like a crease color and a lid
color that's not something that is
always easy for everyone and everybody
has their little routines for an
everyday look so mine just happens to be
all these steps because I really love
makeup and I like taking my time with it
and I like to play around with creating
dimension and deaths and on my face so
that's why I go into the crease and the
lid and the outer crease I'm gonna take
this purple right here
it's the shade turning violet right here
and I'm gonna focus that on the outer
part of the crease and I'm gonna take
this purple right here this is wine and
dine and I'm gonna use the same brush
and hit the outer edges with it just
come in a little further and I want to
keep the lid space pretty open just
because that's what gives this look more
of a natural effect or more of an
everyday kind of wearable look rather
than putting it all over the lid this is
pretty much all the eyeshadow I'm gonna
use on my eye so I'm gonna go right
underneath the lash line with this right
on the outer corners
someone to take these lashes right here
from a lily lashes these are goddess she
has some of my favorite all-time lashes
and these are one of my everyday natural
go-to eyelashes so I'm gonna get the
L'Oreal voluminous lash paradise and a
mystic black and just start to worked
out on the tips of my lashes my real
lashes
I won't go all the way and just because
I don't feel like it really needs it all
the way in there and then you might
accidentally get some on your eyelid and
you don't want that so I'm gonna go and
just touch on the very tips of my
natural lashes so take these guys now
our lashes are on it feels so much
better with lashes week I'm also gonna
take this is you a slim cream eyeliner
in matte nude I'm just gonna run that
right in my inner waterline because I've
been so tired I feel like my eyes are
red and the key looking looking using a
nude pencil on that waterline will make
them look writer more awake and just
look like you have a healthy-looking eye
overall concealer I'm using today is
from Urban Decay it's The Naked skin
concealer in a light neutral down here I
like a little bit with it I always like
my concealers to be a little bit lighter
than the rest of my face just because it
adds a little bit more dimension for the
rest of the face I'm just gonna contour
with the benefit hoola kwikki contour
stick and just go right here I feel like
this is a very natural looking contour
and I don't want anything crazy looking
for an everyday look so I'm just gonna
do a quick
and then what's next so I'm gonna put on
this bronzer from Too Faced it's a cream
bronzer
it's called toasted peach and I'm gonna
work this in with my finger and lately I
just have been loving creams for an
everyday kind of look I just feel like
it looks more natural the highlight that
I'm gonna be using is from benefit this
is the Watts up highlights more like a
cream to powder so I'm just gonna pop it
on my cheeks so this is a really natural
highlight it's more of a wearable
everyday kind of highlight it's not
blinding but when you like move to this
side you can kind of see that your face
has a little bit of a glow to it going
to set my under eyes once everything
kind of dries down a little bit more I'm
actually gonna take this peach blush
just to add a little bit of color to my
cheeks this is from the Too Faced as
well it's called so peachy
it's a bright peach color actually it's
a bright pink color and I'm gonna take
that I mean it's just a tiny bit of it
right on the apples of my cheeks and
spread it out back into the hairline I
have the new Kylie liquid lip she came
out of the shade autumn which is perfect
for fall but I'm gonna do is I'm going
to line my lips with autumn and then go
in with Libra for the inner corners I'm
gonna take trophy which is this
beautiful bronze shade right here I'm
just taking a concealer brush and
popping it right on
thank you guys for watching I hope you
enjoyed this video if you liked it give
it a big thumbs up and if you are not
ready to leave me yet because I'm not
ready to leave you I'm gonna have some
videos over to the side you can check
those out before you leave and before I
let you go I want you to step closer
towards your dream today whatever that
is
sometimes we get so comfortable with
what we do everyday even though we don't
like it like I remember working on an
insurance company I did it every day and
I was good at it but I just I wasn't
happy I was always thinking of this type
of stuff and I finally just just took
that step and now I feel a lot happier
about what I'm doing I feel like I'm not
working and my shirt looks like it's
falling off of my body anyways I hope
you guys take one step towards your
dream today I love you so much and until
the next video I will see you in the
next video bye Dolly's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
