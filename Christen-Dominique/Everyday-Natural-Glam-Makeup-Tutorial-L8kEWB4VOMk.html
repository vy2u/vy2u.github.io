how to get this wet dog razor-sharp hey
guys welcome back to my channel so today
I'm going to be doing this look right
here something that I do no matter what
time of the season or what time the day
it is this looks good no matter where
you're going and it looks good on almost
anybody so I'm going to show you how to
get it it's like a feline cat cat eye
with nude lips a little bit of gloss and
highlight it's an easy simple glam but
anybody can do and I feel like this is
like a staple and a necessity that you
just want to need to know how to do in
your life you know just have in your
pocket on one of those rainy days don't
forget to subscribe to my channel and
also hit that Bell right there to be a
part of the quad family and without
further ado let's get on with this I'm
going to start off by using the herb
ourian glow cream right here
this also can be used as just the
highlighter it's really pretty house
like a holographic look to it and if you
have like texture dry dull skin that's
kind of what I feel like I have right
now this is going to brighten it up
smooth it out and it's kind of like a
really nice primer I'm going to use a
very light layer on my the highlighted
points of my face so I'm going to take
it on the back of my hand so you guys
can see how cool it looks it looks like
it's a white cream like this but then
you let me just show you how cool this
looks gives you like a really nice
hydrated lightweight feeling my face has
been really dry and just really dull
looking and the texture is definitely
there the good thing about this is going
to help with the texture it's gonna fill
in those fine lines but at the same time
it's going to brighten the skin and make
it look a little bit more alive so after
that I'm going to go ahead and get into
my makeup so I'm going to be using this
Estee Lauder Double Wear one of my
favorite foundations I actually have
this in my foundation routine video if
you want to check that out so I'm going
to take a little bit of this on the back
of my hand it can be a little drying
I'll either take the custom cover drops
or I'll take these little drops right
here these are the first Sally rose gold
elixir drops so I'll just take a little
bit of that I'm so excited to show you
the
I found a new alternative to a
Beautyblender so if you want a cheaper
alternative to a Beautyblender this one
is really really good I haven't seen
anybody talk about it this is better
than the Real Techniques Beauty Blender
it's it's not expensive at all it's from
L'Oreal to drugstore and it just blends
everything in perfectly they actually
have three I haven't tried the other two
but I like this is the foundation one
and I really like it
so I'm gonna take some of my hand here
I'm just gonna work it into my skin like
so just balancing it so I'm gonna let
that sit I always put a light layer a
foundation let it dry and then I go back
over with another layer I'm gonna let
that sit and dry and while that does
that I'm going to go ahead and do my
brows off-camera it takes a really long
time for me to do my brows I don't want
to take 100 years so I'm going to go
ahead and use this wet and wild ultimate
brow kit I always fall in love with
their products I love the brow products
from wet and wild I'm going to be using
both of these guys a darker one on the
tail end and then the lighter one
towards the the front of the brow I just
feel like it's so much more natural
using a powder and it's just easy and
quick I'm going to go ahead and clean up
the bottom of the brow so I'm going to
take some concealer on my Mac 242
concealer brush right here so I'm just
going to use this as a primer and also
carve out the shape on the bottom of the
brow so I'm just going to lay that down
all over the lid and then blend it out
with my finger I think skin to skin
makes for like a really even smooth
flawless slend
just makes it look really natural so I'm
going to go ahead and do the other side
okay so now that that's dry I'm gonna go
ahead and add a second layer of
foundation put on some concealer and I'm
going to use this one from Tarte it's
the shape tape samo trusty and then I'm
just going to highlight with it as well
the nose keep pressing it into the skin
okay so while that sets into my skin I
want to go ahead and do my eyes so my
eyes are pretty simple so that the
makeup doesn't fall into the creases and
kind of make lines I'm going to go ahead
and set it in place with this powder
from la girl this is in the shade
beige use this brush right here from the
balm it's called give crease a chance
such a cute brush and it's like delt
dual-ended I'm going to take this flat
side I like that it's flat and kind of
why so it gets all the space on the lid
at one time so for the eyeshadow I'm
going to go in with this palette right
here this is the baked Browns from dose
of colors I always take this with me if
I'm traveling but you can do so much
with these few colors so I'm going to go
on with this shade right here it's
called deserted so I'm going to take
desert is grab a little bit of that
crease color and start to work it in
it's so precise and densely packed that
it's it's not blending out the edges
very well so I'm going to take another
clean fluffy brush Luxy 228 crease brush
and I'm just going to feather out the
edges so it doesn't look super harsh
I want the lid to look bright and
healthy the eye to have like a natural
looking dimension I don't want anything
dramatic for the next crease color I'm
going to take this Brown right here the
darkest one in the palette this one is
called rock bottom we are literally
going to do the easiest by a shadow
today it's gonna be so easy and I always
have a clean brush with me just so that
we can diffuse the edges and that's why
we have these big fluffy brushes just to
diffuse harsh edges and just really
blend out and make our eyeshadow look
soft so I'm going to go in with this
color right here this is tea light and
I'm going to pack that onto the lid so
I'm just taking a flat shader brush
right here this is the zoeva 234 brush I
don't want my eyelid to be too white I
just want it to look like a nice
healthy-looking lid pack on just a tad
bit at a time so I don't overwhelm the
look the lightest hand possible I'm
gonna go ahead and take that same shade
right along the brow bone I'm also going
to take it and put it and put that same
color right in the inner corners just to
brighten it up so I'm gonna go ahead and
do the wing I'm gonna use my Kat Von D
trooper tattoo liner I'm going to do my
winged liner really quick I want to do a
bold winged liner I do one little flick
upwards and then I bring
down and then I inch my way towards the
inner part of the eye now that I have my
wing on there I can really see where I
want to intensify the crease and where I
want it to stop so I'm going to go back
in with my morphe M 507 brush and a
little bit of that dark the darkest
shading the palate diffuse the edges I'm
going to go ahead and do the same thing
to the other eye and bring it down to
the lower lash line just a little bit
just so we can have some kind of depth
there for that I'm going to take this
shade right here in the middle it's
called outdoorsy I'm going to take that
shade right there with this same brush
and just run it along the lower lash
line just like a light wash of color
right there
I'm going to take the same brush drive
and blending everything out with and
just go right underneath this so it's
not any harsh edges and then for mascara
I'm gonna go in with my current favorite
mascara this is from laurie Alice's the
voluminous lashed pyridine this is a
good one this is a really good one for
the lashes I have three pairs if I'm
trying to figure out which one I'm gonna
want to want to kind of want to wet I
think I'm gonna go with Lux because they
look a little bit more fuller than the
rest so I'm going to just do this
off-camera and when I come back I'll
have full flirty lashes BRB so I just
popped on the lashes I'm just going to
use this black eyeliner from Milani and
I'm gonna pop it onto the top of my
waterline to tight line and I'm going to
just do that right now because you can
still see the skin it's kind of weird
whew so there we go you can't see the
skin anymore um I don't like doing this
but it sometimes is necessary I'm going
to take a little bit of that black
eyeliner and also drag it down to the
bottom waterline just a little bit just
take it in a tiny bit don't go all the
way in and you will get that like sharp
cat eye I'm just going to contour really
quick so I'm going to use my Tarte clay
stick Foundation and deep honey and just
carve out the cheeks and I'm just
blending everything in with my Beauty
Blender and I'm going to go in with this
NARS liquid blush and orgasm and I'm
using it as a base today so you can go
about your day using this and this is
really pretty but I'm going to go on top
of it with the powder I want to lock
everything in place so I'm gonna go in
with the shade and light contour palette
and I'm just going to go right over the
cream contour and the cream highlight
that I just did and just make sure that
it sets it in place and it also
intensifies it a little bit more
I'm gonna take my morphe y12 brush and
I'm just going to go into the contour
shades and really intensify the
cheekbones and I always like to blend
any shadow upwards you go down like this
create a shadow like a five o'clock
shadow you don't want that so I'm just
going to go ahead and keep take it
around the temples just where we contour
with the cream and if you're having a
chunky week I also like to take it right
underneath the chin makes it look slim
all right and now I'm going to go ahead
and go under my under eye area and just
brighten it up with those lighter shades
in the contour palette for bronzer I'm
going to go ahead and take my Marc
Jacobs bronzer the ten test it but this
is a morphe brush it doesn't have a
number on it but it looks like this and
just start to warm up my face like right
around the outer perimeters okay for the
highlight I'm going to take this Max
superb extra dimension skin finish right
here it's so gorgeous
look at that so I'm going to take that
on a more pm5 ten brush I always use
this one to highlight and I'm just going
to put it right on the tops of the
cheekbones right there apply the
highlight right where I want it also I
want to go ahead and pop it on to the
inner corners
I'm gonna take my y22 brush from morphe
and just pop it right on the inner
corners and I'm trying to be really
strategic the way I'm putting on this
highlight because I feel like I am
breaking out so much but I don't want to
bring extra emphasis to that area so I'm
just going to put on a little bit more
powder so now we're onto the lips so I
have a few options I couldn't make up my
mind like just going to put all the
options right here these are all new
this is actually a new one from bite
Beauty it's their lip pencil in 0:40
there's no like name to it it's just a
number this is Brown looking shade and
it's super pointy so I'm going to go
ahead and I'm going away and then in the
center I'm going to take Lolita or no
this is Ludwig from Kat Von D
in the center that I'm going to use this
cocoa by Kylie cosmetics gloss and this
is in sugarplum and i'm just going to
basically highlight my Cupid's bow a
little bit of gloss create that wet
shiny look towards the center I feel
like it gives your lips more of a pouty
effect love it and then I'm going to go
ahead and go over my cheeks with this
kylie press blush powder in barely legal
this is actually very similar to the
liquid blush and orgasm from NARS so I'm
just going to pop that right on top to
lock it in place and then to make sure
everything stays in place all day I'm
just going to take my morphe prep and
set to and spritz that all over thank
