these way more often just just a random
thought hey guys welcome back to my
channel today I am doing this very
natural look and it's no liner at all
there is no liner and this is perfect
for somebody who just doesn't want to
waste their time trying to perfect that
winged liner this is something that's
very natural you can wear this every day
it's glowing it's beautiful it's going
to make you look naturally beautiful
without somebody saying your makeup
looks really good they're going to say
you look really good
so I hope you enjoy this video and if
you want to learn how to get it then
keep watching
did you guys know I wore glasses shall I
start off my mornings owe you 10 you got
do let's get started I'm gonna go ahead
and apply the Milani conceal and perfect
the two-in-one foundation
I tried this out on my snapchat with you
guys if you don't follow me you might
want to follow me and I really liked the
coverage of this it can feel or it can
look like you have a lot going on so I
wouldn't use too much of this but the
coverage is really good and you know I'm
all about my coverage because you know
I'm all up you work it onto my neck
I tried this over the weekend and I've
had this for a while it's from Ali
Beauty
it's the perfect prep under eye
brightener yellow for some reason
attracts my eyes it attracts my eyes
when it comes to my under eyes so
anything that's dark I like to put
yellow so I tried this on snapchat too
always like trying new things there just
to like see if I like it I was so afraid
that my entire face would turn into a
banana because it's so yellow it's kind
of scary but it blends out so nicely and
it brightens up really really good so I
just take it all the way into the inner
corner and then Pat it all the way out
to the top of the cheekbone yes it
lightnings everything look brighter it
conceals a little bit this is the tarte
maracuja creaseless concealer it's look
how it comes out yes it's kind of thick
kind of sticky see it's like a little a
little bit goes a long way so I even
take a little bit and just spread it out
like it's thick but I know that Tarte
the stuff that they put into their
products is it's good for your skin so I
don't mind it that's why you find me
using it a lot especially their
foundations I'm just going to fill in my
brows really quick so what I'm doing is
taking a winged liner brush and filling
in the areas where there's little to no
hair because you want to create an even
brow so you want to stay away from the
areas that I already have here and then
if you tilt your head back a little bit
if you have trouble figuring out the
shape you can better see the shape that
your brow naturally goes in and then you
can fill in the bottom so that it looks
more defined and then as I'm filling in
my brows I like to comb them through and
I start from the back and then work my
way forwards create and when I get to
the front I like to do very light short
upward strokes to create those hair like
marks
I'm going to use the shy beam it's a
matte highlight I'm just going to use it
like right here it has like a pink
undertone here and then I'm going to
blend it into my skin with my finger
using light tapping motion so we're done
with that I'm going to go ahead and do a
quick light contour I'm going to use my
Velvet 59 creamy contour kit use the
lightest shade in the palette so I just
want to softly define my cheekbones so
I'm going to take my brush and I'm going
to sweep the contour upwards and then
I'm going to take my Beauty Blender just
to blend out any harsh lines so for the
nose I'm going to take my morphe 50:47
same shade from the Velvet 59 palette
just focus on the tip of the nose
because this part right here is already
pretty thin and doesn't need much
contouring this guy needs a little help
just the tip I'm going to use the meet
matrimony palette from the balm they're
all matte shades going to take matte
Lynn right here apply it all over my lid
I'm going to take it all the way up to
the brow bone and then for the crease
I'm going to take these two guys Matt
Lopez and Matt Evans I'm just using my
luck c2 3231 brush to work that into my
crease
this is a clean blending brush and I'm
just going to use it to clean up the
edges we're just going to use one crease
color just so that we can have a nice
soft definition and then for my inner
corners I'm going to take fanny pack by
color pop this is their cheek shop I'm
going to place it on my inner corners
and my brow bone and a little bit on my
lid
I just want to put this a little bit on
my arch and then blend out the edges of
that
so that's pretty much it for the eyes
now I'm just going to apply some mascara
I'm going to put some mascara on my top
and bottom lashes and I'll be right back
so now I'm going to put on some lashes
I'm using my most natural lashes that I
own these are the foxy locks false
lashes and perfect lash is perfect
lashes
and it takes in my laura mercier
translucent powder in my contour sponge
just to set my under eye mica I'm going
to go for a natural lip lines I'm taking
strip down from Mac and lining my lips
and just is just going to make sure that
they're nice and full and just look
naturally plump then I'm actually going
to go over this with Osnap from
colour-pop I'm going to dust off some of
that contour
I mean bake that I just put on my face
and take banana from uh Nastasia and
brighten up the under eyes a little bit
more this is really pretty shade this is
from japonesque it's a Velvet Touch
blush in OH - it's really really pretty
this is from Charlotte Tilbury this is
the film-star bronze &amp;amp; Glow has a very
natural light soft highlight a little
bit down the nose and chin so as you can
see it got a lot brighter on my lid
that's because they added more of a
fanny pack I just took my concealer
brush added a little bit more on this
area and that's what happened thanks for
