we are doing an eyebrow class today hey
guys welcome back to my channel so today
I'm gonna show you guys how to get your
brows in shape I actually have made so
many freaking mistakes and I changed my
brow shape literally every other week it
depends on which way my brows feel like
going that day brows take such a long
time I have gotten so many requests to
do this video I'm gonna show you all the
do's and don'ts that I feel that I've
learned throughout the years brows are
hard brows are just a tricky thing for a
lot of us so we are gonna go through it
I'm gonna show you some do's and don'ts
keep doing what you love doing but if
you notice some of the don'ts that you
are doing then maybe try the do side and
I think that your brow is gonna look so
good some of you guys may just do all
the dues some of you guys made you all
the donuts let me know below how many
dudes versus the domes that you do
because sometimes I still do the don'ts
so if you want to learn how to get your
brows on fleek then don't forget to
subscribe to my channel and hit that
notification bell so you can be a part
of the quad family and without further
ado let's get on with the video let's do
our brows don't number one brushing your
eyebrow hair in the wrong direction if
you brush this way which is something
that I did all the time it lays your
hairs straight down in the direction
that they should go but then they always
fall downwards especially the tail end
for me so what you do want to use is a
clear brow gel for the do side I'm gonna
be using the benefit Bravo conditioning
primer this is one of my favorite
favorite clear brow gels to use it comes
in this little tube like this it has
these little ridges right here that just
pull and pick up every strand of hair so
I just take out a little bit I tap it on
my hand and then I work it into all of
the little ridges and then what I do is
I brush upward it makes your brows look
fuller does your brow more texture and
helps you create those fine natural hair
strokes
they're so easy to fill in when they're
going straight up number two do not use
the wrong brush now you're thinking if
it says brow brush then I can't be using
the wrong brush because it says bravura
but actually there's so many brow brow
brushes out there that are way too thick
for your brows I'm gonna give you an
example of this brow brush right here
this is the one of the don't brushes and
I say that because it looks great this
way but when I turn it on its side look
how thick this brushes you are gonna get
the thickest lines in your brows I'm
brushing this way and I'm also gonna
brush upwards you see that this is
actually a brow brush too thick I don't
recommend thick brushes like this they
just don't really do much for you they
actually make it easier for you to mess
up and get way too much product on your
brow so this thick brow brush is about
on the deuce side I am using a thin
narrow brush now this is actually not a
brow brush this is a winged liner brush
this is one that I recently found and
absolutely love and you'll notice that a
lot of winged liner brushes are amazing
for your brows this is why if I turn it
on its side it literally disappears it
creates the most fine lines super super
thin little brow hair strokes and it
works amazing and I think dose of colors
just gets it because even though they
call it a winged liner brush it still
has a nice spoolie at the bottom so you
can comb through your brow hairs this is
the supposed brow brush right here and
compare it to this winged liner brush
how crazy is a new middle this do not
use something that is way too dark for
your hair you don't want to go in with a
super dark color and then BAM you have
Sharpie eyebrows if your eyeliner is the
same color as your brow color we need to
start over again instead what you want
to do is either use a pencil like this
it depends on the mood I'm in that day
I'll either use a pencil this one is
from honest hacia the
in soft brown or I'll use just a powder
for those of you who don't want to use
too many products and you just want to
kind of a quick brow the brow pencils
are the easiest because it's just like a
one-step process and you're done
the brow powder does allow you to have
more of a natural looking brow so that's
why I kind of like using that one first
so what I'll do is I'll use a product
that is two shades lighter than my
natural hair color wet-and-wild ultimate
brow kit you guys see me use this all
the time I'm just gonna take this shade
right here mix in a little bit of that
dark shade just a little just literally
a tap like that number four you don't
want to start at the very front of your
brow and create this box the box is not
our friend I have a really long brow
hairs in the front so it's very easy to
create that box to be honest and it's
very hard not to create the box but what
you want to do is start in the arch and
then lightly feather back the strokes to
the tail end once we're finished then we
can move up to this guy right here the
number five don't is don't draw a fluid
line starting from the very front of
your brow all the way to the tail end
you want to go in with a very light hand
and use feather like strokes always want
to feather in your brows because this is
gonna give you the most natural look if
you do one fluid line you are going to
have Sharpie eyebrows a little bit
harder to come back from and you end up
just looking way too or the next don't
is carving out your brows I'm a fan of
it I think it looks clean and beautiful
but there is a certain shade that you
should be using so you don't want to use
something like this this is super bright
white so you don't want to do that what
you want to do is use a shade that is
similar to your under-eye concealer I
like a pretty bright under-eye and
that's fine if you go a few shades
lighter than that or the bottom half of
the brow if you're one of those people
that like a little bit more drama to
your brows and you want to carve out the
top as well I would go with a darker
shade of concealer this is medium
something that's very similar to your
foundation if you're one of those people
that like to carve out the tops of your
brows but if you want to do the bottom
you can get away with using your normal
under-eye concealer make sure that it
isn't is bright make sure you go through
your brows with a spoolie so that you
don't have any patchy spots and you
don't have any really harsh parts of
your brow that you don't want there I
