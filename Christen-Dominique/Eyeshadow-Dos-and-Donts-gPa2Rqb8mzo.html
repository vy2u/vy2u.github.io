back to my channel so today I'm going to
be showing you some eyeshadow do's and
don'ts I have all the don'ts on this
side obviously and all the do's on this
side can you tell I hope so so if you're
having some trouble with blending or
just eyeshadow in general and brushes
don't worry I got you if you do any of
these things that I'm saying are wrong
don't worry if you're happy with it and
keep doing it I'm just giving you
suggestions don't forget to subscribe to
my channel if you haven't already and
hit that notification bow so you can be
part of the pod family and if you want
to learn some do's and don'ts on
eyeshadow then keep watching the first
thing I'm going to talk about is priming
your eyes don't not prime your eye so
this is going to be my eye that I don't
prime it's gonna be bare if I leave it
like this there might be some oils on my
skin that are going to mix into the
eyeshadow and make it just really
difficult to blend the eyeshadow is not
going to look as vibrant and it's
probably not going to last that long on
the do side I would suggest you guys to
prime your eye now I personally rather
use a concealer than a primer but if you
want to use a primer I have some
suggestions for you guys Pro Longwear
Paint Pot in soft ochre from Mac or the
Too Faced shadow insurance is also good
I prefer to use concealer over shadow
bases just because concealers are a
little bit more hydrating you already
have dry skin it may intensify the
flakiness and the dryness and the lines
in your face but the ones that I
suggested to you are pretty good I just
they are a little bit drying for my skin
type but I do always use a concealer to
prime my eyes and if I'm using a
concealer it's usually going to be the
one I use under my eyes something that
doesn't crease so I use either the Tarte
shape tape or the NARS radiant creamy I
go back and forth between them if you're
looking for a good drugstore I would
suggest the Maybelline master conceal
this is really really good for
concealing and also for priming your
eyes I'm going to use a little bit of
the Tarte shape tape just use a little
dot of it and then just blend it in and
I'm working it in with a Beauty Blender
and using these bouncing
motions is going to make sure that it's
going on flawless smooth and your eye
shadow is just going to look like nice
even canvas and if you need to clean up
your brows you can clean those up too
after I like to take a face powder or an
eyeshadow that's similar to my natural
skin tone and what this will do is to
set your shadow in place and also fill
in any line so it's sitting on top of a
smooth surface it's going to help your
brush glide onto your eyelid super
smooth the next don't is don't start off
with a dark shadow in your crease going
in with the darker color is going to
make it really hard to blend out and
it's also going to look very harsh also
I'm using this densely-packed brush and
I just dug it into the eyeshadow that's
only going to make it way harder to
blend if you have blending problems
already this is just gonna make it worse
there's no coming back from this guy do
start off with a transition shade that
is in the shade range that you're going
with I'm going to tap off the excess
because you don't want too much product
on your brush or any hair so I'll take
that hair off in just a second so I'm
going to go ahead and use this tapered
brush right here and I'm going to use a
light hand so I'm going to keep my hand
towards the back of the brush and I'm
going to use back and forth motions
literally just the tip of the brush is
gliding on the skin I'm using this
tapered brush it's going to make it a
lot easier to find the crease and to
blend into the crease and you just want
to use a little bit at a time you want
to start off with a light shade and then
gradually get darker so you have that
nice gradient you want it to look nice
and airy kind of airbrushed and your
crease is right above the lid so stay
right in there but I really like to use
more than one transition shade to get
that gradient look I would suggest you
use two to three eyeshadows in your
crease that I know that might be a lot
for you guys but if you really want that
nice smooth look this is just something
that always works for me start off with
this really light shade right here and
the next shade I'm taking is smitten I'm
going to use the same brush because I'm
not going to go back into this one tap
off the excess and then I'm going to go
into my crease right below the other
shade and with very light pressure go
back and forth or windshield wiper
whichever works best for you and slowly
build up that in
city the next thing we're going to talk
about is adding dimension to your crease
we are still in the crease there's a lot
that we need to know about the crease so
when you add dimension you want to use a
darker shade something that is matte so
I'm going to go ahead and use the
darkest darker I'm going to go ahead and
use the darkest Brown in the palette
which is sweet so on the don't side I'm
going to go in with this big fluffy
brush to add dimension to our eye which
obviously this is the definite don't you
don't want to use something that's too
big and fluffy it's just gonna make the
product go everywhere rather than
getting that precise area so don't go in
with a lot of product at once with the
wrong brush do go in with a small
precision brush that is tapered towards
the end so it does give you that
precision I like this one for morphe M
507 I like to also use this on my lower
lash line so I'm just tapping my brush
in the shadow and then I'm also tapping
the excess off so I'm starting with just
a small amount at a time and I'm holding
my brush a little bit closer to the
bristle because I want to add a little
bit more pressure in a precise area so
I'm just going to use these circular
motions and kind of go and follow my
outer V remember that shadow gets buried
down right into the brush so you'll
always have enough shadow to work with
once you feel like you absolutely have
nothing else on your brush then you can
add a little bit more at a time it's
still patting off the excess you want to
slowly add on and not pack on all at
once so the next thing we're going to
talk about is blending your eyeshadows
so after this is all said and done you
still want to go back over with a clean
blending brush
so here are two brushes this one's
densely packed in dome-shaped this one
the bristles are a little bit more free
towards the top you want your blending
brushes to always be fluffy and clean so
on the don't side I'm going to try to
blend this out as best as I can so don't
hold the brush too close to the handle
this is going to make it really hard to
blend and the outcome may seem super
hard but you do want to use a fluffy
brush hold your brush towards the back
of the handle this is going to help your
brush lightly glide over your shadow
giving it that airbrush effect in making
your eye shadow look and blended
for the lid I'm going to use a really
pretty color this is from makeup geek
it's called in the spotlight don't use a
fluffy brush to apply your lid color
because it's just going to get
everywhere especially if it's a shimmer
that you want on the lid do use a
density pack of shadow brush like this
one so you can get the shadow on in the
precise area that you want without
making it fluff and fly everywhere all
over your face so now we're going to
highlight our brow bone and on the don't
side I'm going to go in with a glittery
pressed powder this is from morphe it's
the mimosa sunday shade I'm using the
right brush but it's just way too much
way too glittery and just too much
actually some shimmers on the brow bone
look really nice if you use them just
below the arch side I'm going in with a
matte bone color and I'm going to blend
it down into the other colors so that it
transitions nicely and the whole look is
really smooth and if you brought your
dark crease color up too high you can
always clean it up so now we're going to
talk about bouncing out your eye shadow
adding something on the lower lash line
to redefine that lower lash line don't
go in with a super dark shadow on your
lower lash line and just keep going
lower and lower because it's literally
gonna look like you're dragging your eye
down and like you haven't gotten sleep
in about 10 years do use the transition
shade just like we did with the crease
we layered on we started off with a
light shadow went a slightly darker and
darker and darker until you got the
intensity that you wanted you basically
want to do the same thing with a lower
lash line just redefining and balancing
out your eye shadow another don't is
don't set your face makeup before you do
your eye shadow because if you have any
mess-ups or want to clean up anything
it's gonna be really hard to clean after
you have powder and cream powder on top
of a cream is basically locking it in
place and if you move that around it's
it's a messy sight
it's a scary sight to see it's not easy
to deal with and it's just not fun at
