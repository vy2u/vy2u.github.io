today we are going to be doing some face
surgery we're gonna be cutting those
cheeks carving that nose our face is
gonna look snatched to the gods my nose
and my double chin are completely gone I
literally feel like this is face surgery
you're cutting into your face and
sculpting out the shape that you want
you don't need surgery all you need is a
cream and powder contour some brushes
and sponges and you're ready to go are
you ready I'm very excited for this
video I've gotten a lot of questions
from friends from family members from
subscribers about contour conundrums
it'd be really difficult especially for
the nose so I really wanted to break it
down for you guys and show you how to
get that flawless looking scalp to face
that you can get at home no cost well a
little bit of class but not as much as
surgery so I'm gonna show you how to get
that before you keep going on with this
video don't forget to subscribe to my
channel and hit that notification bell
so you can be a part of the quad family
and without further ado we're gonna get
on to this video we did my foundation
everything is nice and covered up it
looks even but the only thing is it
looks a little flat so what I'm gonna do
is go ahead and add dimension and death
back into my face I'm gonna change up
the shape of my nose a little bit before
I get into contouring I'm gonna add a
bronze my bronze up my face you don't
have to do this you can actually runs
your face up later on whenever you set
everything but I just like doing this
step personally I think it I think it
makes everything kind of flow and look a
lot more natural-looking
so I'm gonna take this terracotta spray
from Geralyn right here I'm gonna work
that right on the cheekbone this is just
going to bronze up our face and this is
going to be the transition into the
contour so that's why I'm starting off
here you don't have to start off here I
just love the way it makes everything
kind of ease into one another it makes
everything look super super natural
starting off right on the cheekbones
gonna hit right above try to ignore it
in between my fingers you guys I really
tried to take that off with oil oil
strips like tan it just would not come
off it was actually worse than this can
you believe that I think it started with
my cheeks first if I gain weight it goes
to my arms in my face so my face will
get more rounded and so that's why this
part of my face is where I want to
really cut it up and make it super
define basically fake that I have a
skinnier face than I really do so in
order to do that you are going to need
is something to contour with the contour
color that you want to use is something
that's gonna create a natural shadow so
it's gonna be more on the gray tone side
try to stay away from those orange e
shades like like this one that I used
earlier what this is gonna do is just
give you more of a bronze look bronzers
are meant to be used in more of a
general space on your face contouring is
more specific to one area and you want
to be really precise with it so the
difference is you're creating a shadow
so that's why we want to get something
that's more on the gray tone site or the
ashy ur side so for that I have the
Smashbox Studios skin shaping foundation
I absolutely love the contouring side of
the thump this is a foundation on this
side I use this side I really love this
type this is the shade to point to just
in case you guys are wondering I just
love how it's already curved it just
fits right on the hollow perfectly start
right at the hairline and I'm going to
go straight down at an angle because I
want to cut through the cheek I want to
make it look more defined you have kind
of already a slimmer face and you're
just looking for a little more cheap
definition you don't have to go as far
down or if you're looking for a more
youthful look you don't want to go at an
angle you want to go at it like a a
curve right underneath the cheek you
want to cuff it because that's gonna
make it look more soft and rounded if
you go at an angle like this it's gonna
give you more of a defined look some
people may think it's masculine I like
the way it looks on my face personally
and a lot of people with rounded
is usually like the way it looks so I'm
gonna go on the other side right here
starting at the very beginning of the
ear and just work my way down you gotta
kind of play around with contouring and
see which kind of contour style works
best for your face because there are so
many different styles that you can do
also gonna go in to the temple just so
it looks more connected someone goes
through the temple like that and I
really don't feel like I have a big
forehead or like it goes up very far I
don't like to focus too much there but I
do like to add just a little bit more of
a shape here it doesn't have to be
perfect I know an Instagram a lot of us
I'm gonna say us because I'm one of them
we like to show like cool shapes and
stuff but it doesn't have to be perfect
we're gonna blend it out anyways but you
do want to keep it in the area that
you're going to contour if you want a
more defined jawline go ahead and do
this if you feel like your jaw is pretty
snatched already or you're just you're
fine you don't need to add extra makeup
to that part of your face you can skip
it but if you feel like you want more
definitions here at the jaw line you
want to start right behind the ear right
here
if you have a double chin go ahead and
take a contour shade and just go right
underneath it and then of course you
want to blend it down to your neck so
I'm going to take my stick and go
straight up so it's gonna connect
everything together
I actually I don't really care for this
too much but if you want like a pouty
bottom lip you can do a line right
underneath the lip I mean I can show you
guys so that your eyes can look a little
bit more deep set on the hollows of your
eyes like so and then for the nose
everybody has a different nose you're
gonna want different things out of your
nose personally I feel like my nose is
small so it doesn't need to look smaller
but I do feel like it's a little
asymmetrical so you can see it is more
on this side I have a deviated septum so
what I'm gonna do is take the brush and
I'm gonna start right here at the bridge
and just work my way down it's always a
little bit wider at the top and it goes
in as skinny as you want it to right at
the tip then I'm going to work it in to
the nose so I'm basically cutting off
all of this extra nose right here and
forcing the eyes to really focus right
on the center I also want to shorten the
tip of the nose a little bit so what I'm
gonna do is bring this shade down so
that it covers up in the tip but if you
want it to look a little bit more termed
up and rounded you can always put a
little curve here it lets you know what
let's just put the curve what the heck
go ahead and blend this into my skin now
it's really easy to blend you want to
make sure you also blend it right into
the hairline or you can use a beauty
blender which I have it right here on
hand and you just use it very lightly so
you don't remove the entire contour like
to work my contour upwards so you don't
accidentally get it down into this area
and you can either cup your cheek here I
already have very rounded pronounced
cheeks so I like to make sure it stays
at an angle and if it doesn't I'll bring
it down like this
blend this in with the brush first and
then start to work in the beauty blender
and with this you just want to push this
back try not to get it in here now I'm
gonna take my Beauty Blender and just
lightly pounce
over the contour so now we're gonna get
into highlighting the purpose for
highlighting is to bring forward
something make it look bigger brighter
and use something a lot lighter because
I really want it to show up on my face
so I'm gonna go ahead and use this
heart-shaped tape and light neutral and
I'm gonna go underneath my eye and
create a triangle like that fill in this
area right here so let's just fill it in
with a little tip doing this little
triangle right here really lifts the
face this is what's gonna make your face
look like you got a facelift I'm also
gonna go right on the center of the
Cupid's bow and right in the middle
right in this area up everything outside
of this little funny-looking heart
should be deepened up that's generally
what everybody kind of goes for and then
everything within this little heart
you want to look highlighted and bright
so I'm gonna go ahead and also do the
sides of my mouth and this is going to
help turn up your lips and make them
look bigger you feel like your chin
isn't as pronounced as you'd like it to
be then you can also add a little bit of
highlight here and then I'm going to
take my L C sponge because it is very
precise here I'm just going to pounce it
right on the bridge of the nose
I'm also gonna go right along the side
of the nose this is gonna help bring the
sides together and I also have the
sponge that I bronze which is gonna go
right on the edge of the highlight just
so that everything blends together
really nicely set everything in place
this is important because if you don't
do this part if gonna look like a sloppy
Picasso kind of mess at the end of the
day it's gonna look very scary I'm gonna
go ahead and use the peach perfect from
Too Faced so now that is set in place
I'm going to do the powder portion of
the contouring look out a little bit of
my mouth taste it taste we did I'm going
to be right back I'm just going to do
something with my eyes because I feel
really naked right now my favorite
powder contour palette is the shade and
light palette from Kat Von D and we are
gonna start off with the contour so I
like to contour my face with this color
right in the middle evening NARS brush
like this and I like to work this right
down the cheek right in an angle and you
want to use a light hand so that you're
able to move the product easy on your
face if you push down too hard it's
going to press the product further into
your face and it's gonna get really hard
to blend it'll skip and look patchy so
if you just use a very soft hand and
move the product up it'll just move like
butter and then I'm going to go into the
darker shade right here it's the darkest
shade in the palette and I'm going to
focus that on the upper portion and
blend this upwards and we don't want to
move this very far it'll look a little
bit more natural if you just keep the
darkest shade closer to the top of the
ear and then gradually work it down but
still blending upwards and then I like
to take this guy for the nose and just
go over the contour we did on
knows and this is really gonna make your
nose defined and then I like it to get a
little bit wider right around this area
of the nose
now we're gonna highlight I know this
looks really harsh we're gonna go back
and blend that out in just a little bit
but to highlight I'm gonna take this
yellow powder and just a touch of this
guy and I'm gonna go right underneath
for the eyes and this is going to set
everything in place and brighten it up
just a bit more also if you take this
lighter shade and go right on the side
of the nose it's going to push the nose
together so that it looks more narrow
and I'm gonna go straight down the
center this little brush right here and
I'm going to take the darkest highlight
shade in the palette which is this one
and I'm gonna go right on top of that
contour and this kind of helps blend
everything together after this you can
go in and highlight your face I have
this one right here from ELF this is the
elf X heart defense you're a coffee and
cream one I really like this one and you
can just go over the little areas of
your face like I actually like to take
my finger and just work that on the tip
and then just go right here
this is just gonna accentuate the high
points of your face even more
