get porcelain doll flawless face tuned
blurred out looking skin in real life

always had skin issues growing up ever
since I turned 12 like puberty hit my
face turned against me everything that
you can think of I have it on my skin so
I am the best person to show you guys
this type of video I can't believe I've
never done a video like this had acne I
have texture on my skin blemishes I was
teased in school for my dark under-eye
circles my hyperpigmentation I wasn't
allowed to wear makeup for a very long
time I had very strict parents so you
have anything wrong with your face I
probably have it and I can show you how
to make your skin look absolutely
flawless and amazing in person I know a
lot of people think full coverage cake

and tricks on how to make it last long
and look like your skin but super
flawless so if you want to learn my tips
and tricks don't forget to subscribe to
my channel to keep connected with me and
stay up with me every week also hit that
notification bell so you can be a part
of the quad family and without further
ado let's get on with the video before
you get started with putting any makeup
on your face make sure to wash your face
exfoliate moisturize the moisturiser
that I'm using right now is from tatcha
it's the water creme it doesn't feel
greasy I use this all the time obviously
I need some more but I put some on
before I got started I just wanted to
show you that this is one of my favorite
moisturizers that I'm using right now so
I'm going to go ahead and prime my face
I'm actually using two primers a first
primer that I'm using is from Smashbox
this is the pore minimizing primer and I
like to use this on my t-zone because
this is where I have really large pores
when I have pore minimizing primer like
these these thick ones I really like to
Pat it into the skin so that it settles
into those large pores and it fills them
in so it creates a nice even surface I
only like to use this on my t-zone but
for the rest of my skin I like to use
this primer right here this is the photo
finish foundation primer from Smashbox
it's silicone base so silicone is going
to sink into your
phors fill them in and create a nice
even layer nice even surface for your
foundation to stick on to like to go
right above my forehead and just tap it
in there and around the perimeter of my
face this is also going to help your
foundation last longer next I'm going to
jump into my favorite full coverage
foundation it's been a favorite of mine
for a while now as you guys know I've
tried tons of full coverage foundations
but I always come back to this one right
here this is the Estee Lauder Double
Wear and I am in 3 w1 tani the only
thing about this foundation is that it's
a little bit drawing so what I like to
do is take a little bit of the custom
cover drops from cover effects and I'm
going to first pour this onto my hand
the back of my hand just put like a
little bit right there these are the
hydration drops so I'll just take a
little bit of that and put it into the
foundation literally just one drop will
go a long way you want any brush or tool
that you're going to use on your face to
be very clean especially your foundation
so I'm using a clean Beauty Blender it's
not a beet this is a new Beauty Blender
if I were to use this I'd immediately
wash it I don't like to let it sit and
get clogged in here it's just it's kind
of gross this is actually one of the new
Beauty blenders this is the part of the
Spring Fling collection I think it's the
Spring Fling or summer fling or
something like that so I'm going to take
the Beauty Blender and I'm going to work
it into the foundation you don't want
your Beauty Blender to be super wet you
just want it to be damp then it's just
going to soak up all the foundation and
you're just really wasting the
foundation so just make sure that the
Beauty Blender is just damn I'm going to
go ahead and Pat that onto my face and
when I do anything full coverage where I
want the most maximum coverage out of
the product I always make sure to use a
very light hand so I'm using super light
tapping motions all over my face and I
always like to make sure that I bring it
down to my neck so it matches the rest
of my body even though I'm doing a full
coverage foundation I'm going to first
start off with a light layer you don't
want to put on
ton of foundation at one time because
then you are going to definitely have
the cake face but if you just start off
with a light layer and then build up
from there then you'll have more of a
natural flawless looking face rather
than like textured cakey makeup on your
skin so just start off with a light
layer because we're also keep in mind
we're also going to put on concealer
powder there's gonna be a lot of more
things that are going on your face so
just be patient makeup is fun take your
time
I'm not going to focus too much on the
under eye area because we're going to
put concealer there because I've already
done my brows I'm going to stay away
from using the bigger end of the
Beautyblender so I'm going to take the
pointy err side and get into the areas
where I need to get into like right on
the eyelid I love the beauty blenders
point because it gets right on the inner
corners it's kind of a hard area to get
into if you're using a brush or anything
else but the beauty blender just like
pokes at the spot I don't know if that's
a good description but it definitely
gets in there really really well so this
is one light layer of foundation I'll
let it sit I'll do something else and
then I'll go back to it and do another
layer so I'm just gonna go ahead and
carve out my brows a little bit more
while that dries and I'll be right back
okay so now that my brows are pretty
defined I'm going to go ahead and add my
second layer Foundation feel like my
mole is basically almost gone the
lighter I Pat on it the more it's going
to disappear I'm going to let that set
on my face but while it sets I'm going
to go ahead and grab my fix plus this is
the one of the new fix plusses and it
smells so so good it's amazing okay so
now that that's set on my skin I'm going
to go ahead and work on my concealer so
the best the most full coverage the best
concealer of the year goes to Tarte
shaped Apes this just completely cancels
them out completely so I love this so
much this is the Tarte shade tape
enlightening
and I'm just going to take it right
underneath that just fits perfectly
under the eyes take it right down here
I start at the inner corners because
that's where it is the darkest and then
I start to bring it out I'm just going
to go ahead and start on this side and
this gets pretty wet so I like to let it
sit and dry for a little bit it does
kind of dry quickly so it's not too bad
but I like to let it get a little tacky
and then I start working my Beauty
Blender in there and with a concealer I
like to also go right on top of my
eyelid I use this as my primer and this
is actually my favorite to use as a
primer because it does not crease this
is a light medium color I also have
light neutral for the highlight I'll use
this one I'll go like a little ball
right there
and go down the nose and then I'll just
do a few more right in here I keep the
brightest parts right in the center and
then I go around the mouth right on the
Cupid's bow and right on the chin I'm
also going to contour a little bit even
though this is just supposed to be
foundation I'm going to do a little bit
of contouring so I'm taking my deep
honey from Tarte this is their new cool
coverage foundation stick but I'm using
it to contour so I'm just going to do my
cheekbones the nose and then I'll take a
different sponge for the contour am I
going to take you through like my full
steps of contouring but just showing you
a little bit because this is how I add
dimension back into my face and okay so
next I'm going to set everything in
place so that it does not move this is a
very full coverage high-impact
industrial-strength foundation routine
so just letting you guys know that trust
me you're gonna be good now for my under
eyes I like to set this is like this
most important part for me I don't
really like to bake if I do bake I'll
use the Laura Mercier setting powder and
translucent but otherwise right now this
is my ride-or-die Holy Grail this right
here this is the
Von D shade + light contour palette I
have been using this for about two years
straight and I love it right so many
other contour powders I've tried baking
this is just my favorite way to set my
under eyes and these two shades right
here even though everything else broke
it actually fell and it broke everything
I don't use but this middle contour and
these two shades are my ride-or-die Holy
Grail forever until something better
comes out kind of shades so I'm going to
mix these two guys right here and I'm
going to set my under eyes and really
just set everything right in this area
everything out here I use bronzers go
over the contour a little bit more and
to me that sets everything in place it
adds dimension it doesn't create this
flat look I'm going to go over my under
eyes with these two shades right here
I'm using the morphe e49 brush like if
you're interested in this brush or
anything from morphe you can use code
kristin d and it'll give you a discount
so i'm going to go ahead and pop into
these two colors right here and then
what i like to do i don't sweep it onto
my face because this is a very full
coverage look I like to Pat it onto my
face so I'm going to look up into the
heavens and I'm just going to start
patting this like this lay it right on
top and Pat it lightly underneath the
eyes it's going to make everything look
super smooth and brighten it just a tad
bit more so I'm going to take it into
the inner corners bring it down to the
end of the nose and then just tough all
the way through there above the
cheekbone I'll go ahead and do around
the nose and around the mouth as well
just because those areas are darker on
my face and this area right here tends
to be more red and then I'll just set
right in the center because I already
have so much powder on here I won't dig
back in there doing that can really make
this go super cakey very fast so just
stick with what you have on the brush
and work it into the other parts of your
face and I promise you it will work way
better than dipping your brush in a few
more times I'm going to go ahead and tap
my brush right on my lids just just set
the concealer and I'll just go in with
the
powder and start to pack that on right
below the contour and if you have any
type of texture on your face it's better
to go in this way with your brush and
pack it in to your skin rather than
sweeping it I'm gonna go in with my
Milani bronzer to set the outer
perimeters of my face so I'm gonna go
right around the temple cheekbone
everything is set and ready to go this
is my full coverage foundation now I'm
just gonna put on lush highlight
eyeliner things like that and I will be
right back so I'm back with the rest of
my makeup and the last step to make sure
that everything looks flawless and
amazing is to use this fix plus it
doesn't matter what fix plus you use
this one currently I'm using because
it's one of the new ones and it's
coconut I love the scent of coconut so
this is the one I'm going to be using
for a while I'm gonna go ahead and
spritz this on my face this is going to
make your powders look like skin so this
is what's going to help you not look
cakey
