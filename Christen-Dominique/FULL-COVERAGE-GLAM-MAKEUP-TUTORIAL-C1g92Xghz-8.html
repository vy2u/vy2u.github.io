and I go on the dance floor this is what
I do I've done this 30 times let's do
this one more hey guys welcome back to
my channel so today I'm going to be
doing this full glam full-coverage
makeup tutorial I wanted to do something
on my channel that is full coverage you
guys know I love my full coverage I've
said that thousands of times on my
channel I wanted to do a video where I
show you how to get literally a new
layer of skin with no texture that is
what I go for when I do full coverage
glam makeup I want to have another layer
of skin over me so I'm going to show you
how I get super flawless foundation with
a super glam eyeshadow look wing it is
going to look so good and if you don't
last on it so if you want to learn how
to get this look then keep watching if I
know I'm going to go to an event I know
I'm going to be wearing a lot of makeup
so I want to prepare my skin for that a
skincare routine I do every night but I
will do that extra step of exfoliating
and I'll do the face mask so to make
sure that my skin is nice and clean I'm
using this polish dry skin perfecting
exfoliant right here
it's just click the clear liquid like
this I'm going to use my foreo luna 2
for sensitive skin to apply it
there's vibrates on your skin this
really helps exfoliate your skin and
also helps with texture and then I went
in with this secret garden' face mask
just pop this open squeeze out this
serum right here I just put it on my
face and then for the face mask I just
pop this off right here this is the face
mask you just put on your face like this
and wears
there we go and let it rust on your good
and you just do that and I'm sure it
looks a little better but I'm just
showing you a little demonstration why
do I look like Picasso I pamper myself
to get my life together real quick and
then I use this hair mask right here in
my hair I let it sit and then I wash it
out it's just super deeply moisturizing
to your hair special if you have damaged
hair if you color your hair a lot it
really helps to put on a hair mask I
just put myself in my eye
can I tell you guys something I just got
eyelash extensions to follow me on
snapchat i snapchatted the whole thing
you put makeup on every single day and I
take makeup off every day so I am bound
to get stuff on these lashes that is
very hard to take out so if you can tell
they have white little spots it's just
really hard to take off take off it's
really hard to take off of the lashes so
if you're like what is that white stuff
on your eyes it's it's I don't know it's
probably old makeup to be honest now I'm
going to go ahead and prep my face for
the makeup so I'm going to be using this
cover effects illuminating primer this
is going to give us a nice even is gonna
give us a nice even application this is
an illuminating primer as you can see my
skin is already glowing if you feel like
your skin's a little dull it's gonna
brighten it up you know look nice and
glowy it's silicone free so now that our
face is nice and primed I'm gonna go
ahead and put on some foundation the
foundation I use for full intense
coverage is the Estee Lauder Double Wear
now I found a different double wear de
la tur double wear maximum coverage I am
obsessed because you know I love my
coverage love my coverage and this one
is so good I'm in the shade just in case
you guys are wondering if we're the same
shade I am in 3w one tawny switching
things up around here so I'm going to
put it on here I think I use this in my
last video just a little bit I don't
want to go too crazy with it
Beautyblender this for those of you who
want to look like you have a different
layer of skin on it's also very very
matte right it doesn't it look like this
is a new layer of skin just has like a
powdery velvety finish and you can
automatically see that I'm like a snake
right now I just shed the scales and
this is my new skin and can I tell you
guys something I have a lot of
foundation left over so a little bit
goes a very long way I obviously just
wasted a whole bunch of foundation that
I'm gonna try to figure out how to put
back in there
this is not cheap for concealer I'm
going to use my ultimate favorite one
right now is the Tarte shape tape
contour concealer this is in medium
which is the wrong shade for me I don't
know why I grabbed that but that will be
right back okay so I found it right here
this is the light medium one and I use
that underneath my eye and all my
highlight on my highlight spots so I'm
just going to go underneath my under
eyes
so these are the places that I want my
face to look brighter in I want them to
stand out where I just want to hide the
darkness I use this as my base highlight
I kind of let it sit for just a little
bit because I feel like it sticks on a
lot better that way and I'm just gonna
blend it out with my V blender I'm just
gonna fill in my brows really quick I'm
gonna be using the precisely my brow
pencil to fill them in I love this
little guy to bring the little hairlike
strokes in the front it's so good this
is the KU brow brush is such a fine
little tip it just draws the hairs it's
like heaven
it's like razor sharp brushing them
upward I just need like three or four
hairs and I feel like it's even and then
I'm just filling in the little areas and
naked and this one has clothes on that's
how I think of it before I put on any
eyeshadow I'm going to go in with mana
kadar powder in situ warm yellow go over
my lids to kind of set the concealer and
foundation okay so putting on the powder
is gonna help the eyeshadow go on a lot
smoother I'm going to go in I'm so
excited I haven't used this palette yet
on my channel this is the Too Faced the
power of makeup by nikkietutorials
palette and I'm very excited to use it
it's very pretty this is what the
shadows look like so I'm going to go in
with the lightest taupey shade which is
this one here this is painkiller buy
this to my lid and my crease just in
case you guys are wondering what this
brush is it's like a bent to curved
brush this is from Tarte and it shaped
that way so that you it's just easier to
hold whenever you blend whenever you
apply your eyeshadow we always wanted to
start off with using a lighter hand put
your hand on the end of your eyeshadow
brush don't hold it too close right here
because then you have too much control
of the brush you're going to want to
push down harder you're gonna put too
much product down you're not going to
blend it as easy it's going to also go
on a lot lighter so that you can build
I want shall I wash I wash I data
I got watch a lot of beauty bloggers in
the UK like zoella and Dan Iman sooty
and though many of them that their
accent gets stuck in my head and I just
start talking like that now I always say
sir like it's just normal no she has
chocolate Soleil in the palate I'm just
gonna take my brush and work it into
chocolate Soleil and also kind of work
that and the areas we put hand killer
down I'm going to put makeup and chill
on my crease and lid then I want to
intensify the crease a bit more so
instead of I'm gonna use the same shade
but I'm going to use the denser brush so
this is more densely packed this is the
Mac 239 because it's more densely packed
it's going to pick up more product and
work it onto the outer corner I'm going
to take wanted which is this matte black
shade right here I'm going to focus that
on the outer crease just the outer V
area so let's do this
okay so next I'm going to use this jelly
pong pong Neapolitan palette and it has
these three shades in it I'm going to go
ahead and take this shade right here
which is this rosy it reminds me of
Rosie for some reason I'm going to take
this birthday shade and I'm going to pop
it on to the lid on the inner corners
I'm going to take ivy you have closer
set eyes like I do keep the inner part
of your eye as light as can be because
then it can look overwhelming and then
for the brow bone highlight I'm going to
take ivy and just pop it on to the brow
bone everything that I did to the outer
corners of my eyes I'm also going to do
to the bottom part of my lower lash line
and then for my wing I'm going to take
the two-faced sketch marker in charcoal
black and just create that party wing
sometimes what I do to make sure that
they're not lopsided is just create the
base first so they're not like you know
so I'm going to go ahead and bring them
in I'm gonna switch eyeliners just
because I feel like this one is this
because it has a little bit of gray in
it so I'm going to switch to my NYX
squid liner it's very very black this
wing looks like it's literally about to
slice a piece of fruit I'm almost a
little scared of this wing to be honest
I always tilt my head back now so that's
one smooth clean line and not like a
bumpy line just to add even more drama
to our eyes I'm going to use this row
deol smokey eye pen and I'm going to use
it on my lower lash line
and then smoke it up and then for lashes
I'm going to use my iconic I feel like
iconic is pretty standard when you want
to go for glam cuz they are the most
perfect lashes for glam looks see how
spikey they are they're long they're
spiky but there's still PC so you could
still see the eyeshadow underneath pop
these on real quick
now I'm going to go back to my face look
at my claws I want to bake my under eyes
first because I don't want my under eyes
to crease and I want you guys to bake
your face especially your under eyes if
you have a creasing problem with
as under eyes which a lot of us do would
be glam you're going to be out all
nights probably at a big event you don't
want these big creases in your under
eyes seeing the Kat Von D translucent
powder to bake today okay I'm having a
difficult time opening this as I told
you guys before it's so hard to do
anything with these nails besides to
pick your nose this is my dance move and
I go on the dance floor this is what I
do I'm so cool definitely one of the
cool kids in school not I'm just going
to set my makeup all over my face going
to go down my nap and take the lightest
shade of contour it's tiny tad bit just
to intensify the shade you see how much
it's about to be snatch I'm going to
take the lightest shade in the palette
which you can tell I use a lot and just
dab it right in the middle so next going
to use the Pacifica Sun dreams Lotus
infused bronzer this is in the shade
sunkissed and we use is the blush brush
to add some warmth to my face okay for
my cheek color I'm going to take justify
my love from the nikkietutorials palette
this very pretty pink right here and
work it on too much E and then for the
highlight I'm going to take champagne
truffle and highlight my face you guys
have to tell me how many times I
highlighted in this video because I know
I've highlighted like six times I take
it right here so the light naturally
hits my nose gonna put on my little
mustache highlight
now we're on to the final step the lip
the next thing I'm going to use is the
pickup liner from the balm and I really
take you because it looks like dirt it's
like a dirt color that's the kind of
colors really so next I'm going to take
this matte cream Sheen glass and it's a
strike in case you guys were wondering
what I'm wearing on my nails this is a
nail polish from dermelect I got this
from my Ipsy glam bag and it's in the
shade unscripted which by the way is so
