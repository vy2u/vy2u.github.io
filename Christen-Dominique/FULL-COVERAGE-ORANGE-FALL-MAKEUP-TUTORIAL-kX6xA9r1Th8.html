we are doing this look right here this
is very much inspired by the PSL that
just came out
but my first PSL is not with Starbucks
because you don't have to have Starbucks
to have a PSL I actually love Pete's
coffee so this is not a sponsored video
today is my first day with a pumpkin
spice latte so that means it is
officially fall
I don't know when fall actually starts
but today it's my fault I just got my
huda beauty palette in it is so
beautiful look at this packaging is
always amazing with huda beauty this is
my first actual human BD palette she has
a lot of warm colors in here that I
absolutely love unfortunately my Cosmo
came in a little broken but that's okay
I still have some glitter around the
edges and I'll make it work a lot of
these colors are very warm red so I'm
like okay I just got my first pumpkin
spice latte for this season there's a
lot of pumpkin warmth going on right
here this looks like a the first leaf
that dropped off of the tree and fell on
the ground it's right on my eye right
now
with the pop of blue that's what's going
on in my eye right now we are doing the
first fall makeup look I'm gonna have a
ton more fall makeup looks because I
love fall makeup I think it's so
gorgeous
and it really accentuates the eyes I
think it looks beautiful on a lot of
skin tones have a pop of blue on the
lash line to mix it up a little bit I
think drool colors look really beautiful
in the fall as well so I have a little
bit of that so if you want to see how I
achieved this look right here this
pumpkin spice latte on my eyes / xxx hot
cheeto then just keep watching don't
forget to subscribe to my channel and
hit that notification bow so you could
be a part of the quad family and without
further ado we are gonna get on into
this for yourself of the season this
moment is very special right now I'm
gonna start off with my brows already
moisturize my face
and I'm gonna get straight into the eye
makeup first because I like the way my
makeup is been coming out when I just do
my eyes without doing foundation or
anything so I am gonna start off with
the eyes brows I'm going to be using the
goof proof brow pencil in the shade
number four kind of in my jam lately
I've been using this for my brows in my
videos lately because it just it's so
fast and easy if I sound a little weird
muff ly it's because I'm a little sick a
little on the sticky side today hoping
I'll get better and a few days already
been kind of sick for about almost a
week so I'm hoping it'll get better soon
okay I'm gonna put this underneath my
eyes before I start on my eye makeup
this is the benefit puff off it's a
instant eye gel that I can't seem to so
it looks like this it's called the puff
off just gonna use it underneath my eyes
because my under eyes I haven't been
getting that much sleep because I've
been coughing all night
coughing my brains out and my under eyes
are looking a little tired with the tart
shape taped in medium to set the eyes
this tiny little Beauty Blender right
here
and I'm gonna work that in all over my
eyelid I'm gonna cover my entire eyelid
with a desert sand which is this shade
right here I just got my nails done I'm
very excited about these nails I told
him I told my nail person just give me
something
mocha pumpkin spice fall latte inspired
something like that and this is what he
came up with and I really like I'm gonna
take that all over the lids and mister
at the base of the lid and work my way
up
so this palette is pretty warm gives me
fall vibes the only thing that made me
sad when this palette came in is the
Cosmo shade which is the only glitter
press came in completely broken apart so
I looked at everyone else's that got
theirs theirs came intact so I think it
just me might be something wrong with
the way mine came in I don't think
everybody else's was like that but from
what I see everybody else's Cosmo was
pretty nice and pretty the first shadow
that I'm gonna go in with is ash is
eaten just to give us warm us up a
little bit in the crease so I'm going to
take this with my luck see 229 brush and
just start to work that right in that
hollow area I just want like a pumpkin
spice first leaf falling off of the tree
kind of rustic I look today so that is
what I'm going for the next color I'm
gonna go in with is blazing right here
so I'm just gonna pop that on to the lid
I'm gonna lay that down all over the lid
and work that into the crease
and when I start to blend this out I
want to work it in an angle and this is
because I want to give my eye more of a
lifted appearance so especially since my
eyes are kind of I feel like my eyes are
kind of droopy and like sickly looking
so I just want to lift them up next
color I'm gonna go into is amber work
that into the outer part of the crease
like the outer V area for the next color
I'm going to take saffron I think that's
the way you say it I'm gonna take that
color right there and I'm gonna pop that
on to the outer V as well but I'm still
gonna keep it to where you can see the
amber the shade amber smaller brush so
we can get a little bit more detailed
with this so I'm this is the M 506 for
more feet I'm going to take that one and
start to focus this a little bit closer
to the hollow I'm actually gonna mix
that shade with this shade as well I
don't know the name of it so I'm just
gonna mix it with this brown shade just
to make it a little bit more intense and
deep this ilyich almost reminds me of
just like a little fireball or that a
little lit fireball and instant stories
for the next shade I'm gonna pop it on
right in the inner part of the eye I'm
either gonna take Turkish delight our
Blood Moon I'm just gonna swatch them on
my fingers first to see which one I
this is how I decide which one I think
we're gonna go with this eyeshadow look
so far is reminding me of an extreme hot
cheeto for all you hot cheeto lovers out
there this one's for you I think I'm
gonna go with this guy right here put
that on to the inner corner of the eye
and take it into the inner third I'm
gonna leave that center part matte
because usually we pop on that Center
highlight but this time I'm gonna change
it up leave it matte I'm just gonna take
a little bit of this medium concealer
and this concealer brush right here from
the makeup shock 286 and I'm gonna clean
up the brow bones
now that the brows are cleaned up I'm
gonna go in with desert sand and I'm
just gonna set the concealer in place
and bring that down into the shadow now
I'm gonna go in with eyeliner so for the
eyeliner I'm going to use as I've been
loving this eyeliner so much the hardest
liner from Tarte it's the double take
liner I'm using this side because it is
extremely black and I'm going to I'm
gonna put on some mascara the mascara
I'm using is from roller LA or just from
benefit the roller lash mascara so I'm
just gonna coat my lashes with a few
coats of this mascara okay so our lashes
are on and I'm gonna start working on
fixing this face right here and oh I
just got this new primer from Smashbox I
just came back from Fiji and they showed
us this rhymer that works amazing on the
skin it's super hydrating it's a primer
and a moisturizer all in one in anything
that has to do with moisturizing your
face you know I'm all about it I need to
try it and I need to put it on my face
immediately so I tried this out I really
liked it and I just like the way my
makeup lies on my skin when I put this
on it just goes on so smooth
the feeling of it as soon as you put it
on it's just like your skin is drinking
water and it just glides on the skin so
easy and it literally feels you can feel
your skin soaking up the moisture
instantly so now that we have our primer
on our face is ready for foundation the
foundation I'm using today is from
L'Oreal this is the infallible Pro matte
and I am in the state in the shade Sun
beige start to cover all this redness
discoloration mosquito bites hackneyed
okay now I'm gonna cover my under eyes
and to do that I'm gonna go with medium
today something a little bit more on the
natural side of things I'm gonna go
ahead and highlight with that too so
we're not gonna have like an intense
bright highlight so now that we're
concealed our face is looking good so
far we need to bring back out those the
contours of our face so to do that I'm
gonna be using this shaping foundation
from Smashbox and I'm not using the
foundation part but I am using the
shaping part of the stick I love this
shade for contouring and I love this
shape of this stick right here if they
could just you make this by itself I
wouldn't I would use this all the time
this is in the shade soft contour 2.2 so
I'm gonna go right underneath the hollow
of the cheek bone and bring it down
right about there see it has that ashy
undertone is I usually gravitate towards
more of the a sheer tones for the
contours I want it to look like a shadow
go ahead and blend that in blending it
upwards and then I'm gonna go on with
this smaller end make sure it's nice and
wet not too wet so if it is too wet then
you definitely want to go and dry it or
at least get a napkin or towel and just
kind of press it and then start to work
in your products so I'm just making
these really short and balancing motions
so it blends into the skin like it's
actually a natural shadow and
on the other side and voila contour I'm
going to take this little angled brush
right here I think they want this to be
a brow brush but look how thick that is
it's not gonna work for me so I'm gonna
use it on my lower lash line and check
amber and I'm gonna work that right on
the lash line so on the waterline I'm
gonna go in with this a blue pencil
right here from Marc Jacobs it's in the
shade wavelength I'm gonna add a little
bit of the brown on the outer part of
the lash line just to give it a little
bit more warmth okay so I'm gonna set my
under eyes with the Too Faced I want
candy banana pudding powders so cute
it's the brightening face powder so I'm
gonna try this guy out for my under eyes
and basically where I would want to
brighten any anything up if I could
smell which I can I can smell the banana
so I'm gonna use this guy right here
load up my brush
I love the whole candy collection it
smells like candy and pudding and just
amazing sweet happy things just like
candy she's just a big happy ball of
sweetness so I'm gonna go ahead and use
that
underneath is that I I love yellow
powders on my face it just makes me so
so happy this also has a little bit of
purple and pink for a color correcting
brightening color so I think this is
gonna work great as a brightener without
it being really intense and bright it's
still giving you that that fresh awake
kind of look I'm gonna go in with this
highlight from Becca this is the
shimmering skin Perfector in opal and
I'm just gonna pop that onto the
cheekbones half red from Mac it's a lip
liner
and then immunity max hickory north on
the outer edges and I feel like this
kind of ties in that red fiery warmth
that our eyes are giving us without
overwhelming the lip and then right on
top I'm gonna do a nudie you would this
nude just because it is super new Andy
collaboration a liquid melted matte
liquid lipstick in the shade
I scream okay so now I'm taking all the
lip liners that I have to create my own
custom lip look right now so I'm taking
root in color pop it's the lippie pencil
and I'm also taking it on the outer
corners of the lip um the only thing I
forgot oh my gosh
I was about to go on with my life
without using a blush or bronzer the
Kylie blush in x-rated
just because we have a very peachy eye
so I'm gonna go with the peachy blush
I'm gonna take this guy right here it's
very matte just the way I like my
blushes I'm gonna take the peach blush
and just press it onto the lips I just
feel like it's gonna mesh the entire
look together and it's gonna keep
everything in place I feel like I'm a
very powdery right now so I'm just gonna
spritz some of this Elsi Hydra mist
almighty so Wow
