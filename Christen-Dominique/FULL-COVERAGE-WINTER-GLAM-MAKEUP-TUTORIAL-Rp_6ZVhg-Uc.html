you want to get into this video don't
forget to subscribe to my channel and
hit that notification bousley to be a
part of the quad family and without
further ado let's get on with the video
I'm gonna start off with a Smashbox
photo-finish hydrating primer and work
it in really good because my skin is
extremely dry my lips are really dry I
have just been trying to look as normal
as possible these days I have been sick
for like it feels like such a long time
my eyes are darker than usual my voice
is still a little scratchy but it's
definitely way better than what it was
if you guys are out there right now and
you're sick flu season is really bad
right now and I just want to give you
some pointers I have the it cause and
that
confidence in a cream on my face I have
the same under-eye cream and then this
hydrating primer so anything that can
make your face look a little bit more
plump is what you want to grab also for
my lips today I'm using the drunk
elephant lippy just because we don't
want crack lips they're still trying to
look glam through the sickness we're
still trying to look glam through the
winter after I'm hydrated super
moisturized then I go I can move on to
my skin I'm actually gonna do my skin
first and then my brows I've never tried
this foundation and I just got this in
and from Dior and I'm really excited to
use it because I looked it up on Sephora
and it has almost a five-star rating and
a ton of really really good reviews the
one thing I noticed about it when i
swatched it on my hand is that it is
very very thin diluted now let me try
this myself because I haven't tried it
out so let me see if this is actually
buildable to full coverage I know it is
definitely a medium coverage I just love
that maximum coverage with that barely
there feeling which is really hard to
find so if this is that foundation I may
have one of my favorite foundations
already like just the corner of my eye
the darkness is already going away which
is awesome and also just a tip for you
guys always like to give you guys tips
as I go through my process this
foundation smells really good if you use
a lighter hand you're going to get more
coverage I'm just like very lightly
balancing that on my skin this is
actually the perfect color for my skin
tone I'm just gonna do half just to see
and we can compare together how well it
is covering up my skin without making it
look cakey because it feels like I have
nothing on my skin right now that is
actually amazing because it really feels
like I have nothing on my face right now
and I just put like two layers on my
face from sick Toula who I've never even
heard of the sickness - ill what is that
this side of my face looks so healthy oh
my gosh that is crazy this foundation is
really good and it says to shake well
before using it which I didn't do
we'll just shake it midway through no
big deal I I didn't even tell you the
shape gosh I haven't filmed and
feel like it haven't flown in so long I
don't even know how to do this right now
this is shade 23 so let's see if it
works its magic on this side of my face
this should have been half and half way
caps it and a half not sick or I don't
know how it would title that but it
should have been something like half in
huh I'm gonna put on my brows really
quick there's a new brow pencil from
Maybelline that I wanted to try out it's
called a total temptation brow definer
in deep brown it looks like this I just
when I see pink it's super girly I love
it and I just want to use it it's like a
tiny little midget spoolie and I think
it's the cutest thing and I actually
feel like it would be more useful than
the longer one so I just want to try it
out everything around your brow area is
dry then I would go in with your brow
pencil or powder or whatever it's like a
diamond shape so I feel like I can get
some really precise lines with the tip
and then if I want to fill in the rest
of the brow I can do that easily with
just one brush just by looking at it so
I'm really excited to try this and then
I'm gonna take this little guys so cute
reminds me of Bobo's face and just brush
the hairs upwards and comb through and
I'm just I'm happy with the way my
eyebrow looks like this I think it's
supernatural and I think that this color
works perfectly for my brow color I'm
gonna go ahead and get into the Urban
Decay excursion Li and daydream palette
I think this is the most
delicious-looking packaging I just want
to eat it or lick it or something or put
my finger in it it looks way too good
I'm just saying like it makes me want to
eat cake right now there's such a
beautiful peachy kind of palette it's
like something you can wear every day
and you open it up and it's just really
pretty whimsical flowers it just looks
so so cute it has a little brush in it
little turquoise brush one side is flat
and then the other side is a little bit
more tapered so you can get like on the
lower lash line or you can do the outer
corner I'm gonna start out with Lucy
Lucy is just a matte cream bone shade
that I'm gonna put all over my lid this
is gonna instantly make your eye look
awake and alive I'm gonna go ahead
and work the 1212 onto the lid with a
flat brush so I'm going to take a day
dream me lightest crease color and
subscribe I'm gonna mix them together
right around that peachy shade okay so I
just made a decision right now to put
tape on the edge of my eye because I
wanted to have more of a cat eye look so
I'm gonna grab that actually line it up
right here to the edge of my brow so
just like that okay I haven't done that
in a very very long time so I probably
just taped some of my lashes but that's
okay so anything that goes outside of
this is not gonna touch your skin so
when you peel it off it's gonna have a
nice sharp edge to it it's gonna make it
a little bit more glam without having to
try you're just feeling a little lazy
you know there's something like you
might let the tape work for you so I'm
just going to bring out that those brown
shades those natural warm tones I'm
gonna take a fluffier brush and just go
around the edges and softly buff out all
of the edges deepen up this outer crease
with eight gemenese the little brush
that comes in here so I'm gonna take
that right on the edge just kind of the
perfect brush to do this with a really
nice chocolate brown I take this brush
right here it's the m5 oh seven and a
little bit of eight and we'll work that
into this area right here like right on
that crease just to deepen it up a
little bit add some depth so this is
more of a glam look so I'm gonna take
this black this is a new brand that I
haven't used it's called wander beauty
and this is a gel pencil in blacks and
it looks like a really high-quality
pencil and a lot of their makeup looks
very high-quality so I'm really
interested to try it and I live my I
have a little bit just dragged it right
across and work it right on the edge you
don't have to really worry about messing
it up because the tape is your guide I'm
gonna start to drag out the black with
this liner brush I'm gonna drag it out
but I'm also going to clean it up
soften the edges
and make it look a lot more smooth once
I smoothed it out I'm gonna take more of
the eight shade and work it right on top
is gonna give it more of like a smoked
out effect it's also gonna make the
block look less intense gives me more of
like that chocolate hot cocoa winter day
by winter night actually or if you want
to wear it during the day up to you but
for sure it's gonna give you that smoky
look
I'm gonna peel this off and hope that it
doesn't look crazy crazy let's just see
what it looks like oh all right
it's pretty good just clean that up a
little bit there is this really pretty
shade that I definitely want to work
into the inner corners this shade right
here I actually want to put it all over
my eyelid but since we already are here
I'm gonna take corona from the
Kaleidoscope palette we use this side of
the brush to just work that into the
inner corners this is such a beautiful
bronzy golden color I think this has got
to be one of my favorite colors for sure
so I'm gonna clean off my face put on
some mascara and lashes so LC just
launched a mascara it's called lash full
that's a cute name lash ball it's more I
feel like this is more of a lengthening
mascara and it also pulls out those
hidden lashes I usually wait to put on
mascara on the lower lashes until I'm
done but who's watching okay so now I'm
gonna go ahead and pop on these lashes
from a hooter Beauty these are the
Noelle's got the lashes on and they're
really interesting because I hadn't
opened them before these are not
double-stacked they came apart like
they're two different lashes she's
interesting I didn't know that they were
made like that but it's a really really
pretty and just super fluffy so I really
like them I'm gonna take daydream and
subscribe again on the lower lash line
because my eyes are a little bit more
red and I'm still kind of sick and I
want to look awake and healthy I'm gonna
take this wander Beauty new gel pencil
and I'm just gonna hit it right on the
waterline I just want to show you the
difference before I go back now we are
higher alive and we are going to conquer
the world from now on so I just got
these new highlights in from hourglass
is called the vanish champagne flash is
the color I have and it's a highlight
that looks like this I'm gonna go ahead
and use this on my cheekbones to give me
that glow and I'm putting a light layer
on before I put on my concealer and if
you're looking for another thin formula
that's a really full coverage the Urban
Decay Naked skin 1 is another amazing
feeling on your face without having the
cake and then it gives you that flawless
look I'm not gonna push down too hard
because I want to get the most out of
the concealer I want it to be more full
coverage because my under eyes are extra
dark and if you put this type of
highlight underneath your concealer or
have it slightly coming through your
concealer it's gonna give you more of a
natural glowing within kind of look
contours I'm using is from Natasha de
Nonna
this guy right here it's a really good
sculpting powder I'm gonna do my nose
first
let's get that straightened out
literally this is a bm5 72 brush from
morphe and I'm just gonna work that
right along the edge of my nose and I'm
blending around the nostril just so you
guys know all the info and then you can
go across as well but I'm not actually
gonna go across today I'm just gonna go
right below your new time you contour
make sure that you are blending upwards
not downwards and because my face is a
little bit more rounded instead of
cupping it right in this way I like to
go straight down towards the end of my
mouth right on the corner and it just
gives the illusion of a more slender
face if you're more rounded I'm going to
take the highlight from Kristen Lea and
this is the beauty beam highlight
palette I'm gonna take these two colors
right here you can't see them right in
there oh my god how does that even
happen gonna take those colors and just
work a little bit right onto the cheeks
I don't want a crazy highlight today I
just want something that's more subtle
and then I have this zoeva opulence
palette and it's such a pretty package
I'm gonna take the two middle shades mix
them together and tie a little bit to my
cheeks like a tiny bit and I'm not
touching the Apple I'm letting the
highlight kind of sit there and shine or
the lip we are gonna go she actually
Kristin Leanna has three lips and
they're in these hot pink lipstick cases
there
really cute there is a purple one and
it's called cloud 9 it's matte and there
is bun-bun it's a comfort mat and yeah
it's bug button and it's cute because it
has Kristin Lee and there's a heart with
her name right in the middle of it it's
actually really pretty color I think
this is actually a really pretty color
and I think I might try this one with
this look there is also spellbound which
is a mega match a dark purple oh I
forgot to set my makeup I'm gonna set my
makeup with the wander Beauty in there
powder foundation it's actually a medium
but it's pretty light looks like that
