off sometimes you do what you gotta do
hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today my skills were tested today
everything on my face was nothing but
dollar makeup so I have seen this video
go around for a long time and I've
always wanted to do it but I've always
been really scared to do it because I
don't know how the products are gonna
react on my skin sighs very sensitive
skin and I don't I want the look to look
good some products in this video are
even better than high-end brands so I
was like this is what I came up with at
the end if you want to see the struggles
the triumphs and everything that I went
through to try to get this to look like
this because I definitely saved this
look with some hacks so if you guys have
makeup that is just not working for you
and you don't have the time to take it
back or get new makeup if you're on a
budget I'm gonna actually show you some
hacks in this video to make it look good
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
and you hit that notification bell so
you can be a part of the quad family it
went out further adieu let's get on with
the video you know i'ma go in with is
this AOA studio wonder skin perfecting
blur primer so I wanted to look for
something that was gonna blur my pores
out and this guy looked like it is okay
to use on my face and now that I have it
in my hand I'm noticing right now that
there are large gold glitter flecks in
it they're pretty large like they're
super big let's see if this actually
blurs my face out for a second not gonna
lie I'm kind of nervous but we're gonna
try it and it looks like that actually
looks really pretty and it's super super
thin I thought it was gonna be really
thick and it looks like my whole entire
face is gonna be full of gold glitter
and yep there are gold glitter flecks
all over my face so the next thing that
I got was the LA Colors the liquid
makeup foundation and this is in the
shade creamy beige which is more of like
the lighter to
I'm skin tone and right now I'm pretty
like light/medium so I figured that this
would be my shade this does look a very
orange so I feel like I'm gonna end up
looking like one at the end of this
video but we're gonna try it out let's
see where it takes us and apply the
foundation I got these little contour
sponges which are really cute they look
like little houses went ahead and I wet
one of them so it's a little bit bigger
ooh that is a very hard pump so when you
squeeze it down like you really have to
use your finger muscle if there was one
and I'm really hoping that this is some
type of full coverage so let's see how
this works or if you have ever watched
clothes at like a laundry mat that's
what this smells like
they detergent it smells like detergent
like florally detergent the weird thing
about this is that it's pretty thick
like it feels pretty heavy but when you
put it on I don't think it covers I mean
well it doesn't cover for me I was kind
of smearing around and it's all gone and
that was a big goop now it's gone I
don't know where it went because
definitely not on my face and I'm gonna
try to get more of it on my face
okay what do you guys think about the
coverage one layer of nothing wow this
is absolutely no coverage whatsoever I
feel like I'm putting on 500 layers of
foundation but you still can't see the
difference final verdict no coverage
whatsoever it's even probably just
oxidizing to this red tone oh my god
that is not cute this is definitely a
fail for okay I'm just gonna hope and
pray that the concealer is better than
this so this was a fail I'm gonna take
the concealer this is the amuse
Cosmetics
two-in-one foundation concealer so
hopefully this has some type of coverage
I did get it because it did say full
coverage for this being like almost the
lightest think this is pretty dark I'm
just gonna you know what I'm just gonna
put this everywhere all over my face
because that foundation did nothing at
all
and I'm gonna try to work this one in
before I say anything it's almost it's
red this was the lightest concealer
shade and it is a really really dark and
I got a second one just in case the
lighter one was too light and no this is
basically orange but it's definitely
covering up way more than the foundation
oh my gosh so orange have you guys ever
seen click where Adam Sandler's in the
car and he's pressing the little button
and it's turning his body green I feel
like that's what's happening in orange
right now to my face okay we are
officially in Orange the brows that I
have are from a muse cosmetics it's the
eyebrow powder and I also got like a
little pencil too this is the sculpt
brow pencil from AOA Studio so let's see
how this works hopefully this is gonna
help our face in some way I don't know
like my face just looks so jacked up
right now I'm gonna start with the
powder so it comes with like this shade
right here and this one I'm gonna take
the meeting
she and it has like a little mirror
inside which is cool I'm just gonna
start to fill in my brows okay so far
the brow powder I can't take myself
seriously looking at my face like this
look how orange my face the brow powder
seems to be working pretty good like
it's really good the color I like the
way it's just it's not too intense but
you can build it up it's really nice am
a very very surprised that this is
working so well let's get this brow
pencil and see how it works I would have
to say that the pencils not bad but if I
had to go with just buying one of these
products I would just go with this one
before I do that I shadow I'm just gonna
bake underneath my eyes and the setting
powder that I got was from AOA studio
it's a brightening powder that's why I
got it
so brighten the under eye circles so
hopefully this does something it's
actually sealed really well take some of
this guy on the under eyes it's like a
peachy kind of powder so I like the
color of it yes you need to be gliding
on the skin pretty nice so gonna put it
in the middle of my forehead
hopefully it'll brighten something up
right there so I'm gonna take this
actually my take this shade right here
and set my under my eyes I'm actually
gonna mix them together and just set my
entire eyelid with this so I'm gonna
take this blue shade right here works up
on my lid like all over my lid okay so
my camera cut off so I already have the
blue on the lower lash line so I'm just
taking it around there and bringing not
on your eyeball but below your eyeball
it's gonna bring that down in our
corners yes we're blue the eyeshadows
not actually too bad to work with it's a
little patchy it's not super pigmented
but it's not like just falling off of my
eye yet right I'm gonna go in with this
brush right here I'm gonna take that
purple right next to it and probably a
little bit of this too and just starts
to soften out the edges I'm gonna take
the same Purple's I'm gonna bring them
right below the blue and then I'm going
to go in with the brown palette just
okey shade and this one to work on the
outer edge I'm honestly not mad at how
these eyeshadows are blending together
it's not bad for a dollar like I'm sure
I'm gonna take the highlight that we
were going to use
our cheeks I'm gonna use it right on the
inner corners so this is from the AOA
studio it's the Wonder baked highlight
and the shade cupcake this looks like a
hot mess to be honest let's see if the
eyeliner can bring us back to life I
really like the way this eyeliner glides
it's a really really black and it just
glides on so okay now it's starting to
burn yep I hope that really really quick
so for mascara we have the starry
mascara looks like this pretty cool
packaging kind of glam for a dollar
I'm just gonna add some mascara my eye
feels like it's gonna burn off but if
you made I product shouldn't be not burn
your eye the lashes that I have are two
dollars I know it's kind of pricey for
this makeup tutorial cheapest ones I had
actually just forgot to buy lashes and I
have these from ELF so I was like it's
pretty close just a dollar more okay at
this point I think I've been baking for
quite a long time I'm praying that it
brightened up some parts of my face so
let's see what we look like after this
kind of brighten up my under eyes a
little bit more I'm gonna take this
shade right here from the lighter the
topi palette and just try to brighten it
up in some way shape or form because
this is actually what I used to do
before I knew about like contouring or
anything like that I just take my
eyeshadow and put it on like as a
setting brightening powder I kind of
want to just try to put this all over my
face
okay so bronzer is next the bronzer that
I have is from is from Malibu glitz okay
it looks like this it has a little
flower imprints on it like little
daisies or whatever you call them not
that we need to look any more Orange but
I'm gonna bronze my face I also have
this blush so many is this blush right
here this is from Malibu glitz
it's called blusher and it has like a
rose petal in the middle for highlight
I'm gonna be using the Ã£oÃ£ studio wonder
baked highlighter in cupcake and
we are going to highlight the face
they're all laminated okay we're getting
some kind of brightness here for the
lips I'm going to use the AOA studio
lipliner in bombshell actually very
orange too but it goes on so saw this is
the AOA studio Wonder matte liquid
lipstick and work it it's like a pretty
Bobby pink let's boo this smells really
good Wow okay this is a really bright I
was going for like a nude but I don't
know what this is I feel like this is so
orange and start to shade in the edges
just so we give some type of definition
and because I don't want to use any of
my products like I just want to use
straight dollar makeup so I don't want
to cheat you guys but if you have an
eyeshadow and you really need to make it
work I mean you do what you got to do
sometimes you do what you gotta do I'm
actually I'm gonna go back in with the
brown and try to contour a little bit
more of my nose you know I'm just taking
that Brown to do all this extra stuff
thank you guys for watching I hope you
enjoyed this video if you like this
video don't forget you thumbs it up for
me and before I let you go I just want
to remind you to say what's on your mind
sometimes we hold ourselves back and
just for the sake of not making of like
the situation not making it
uncomfortable but sometimes you have to
say what's on your mind
or people won't understand you or people
won't really get a real sense of you so
don't be shy say what's on your mind
when you need to say it and that's it I
love you guys so much I will see you in
