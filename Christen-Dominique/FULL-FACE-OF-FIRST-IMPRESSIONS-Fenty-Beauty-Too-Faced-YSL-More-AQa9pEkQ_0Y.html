with all this highlight this just it
speaks to man's hey guys welcome back to
my channel so today we are doing a full
face of first impressions using all new
makeup from Too Faced peaches and cream
the smells of the Too Faced collection
we're gonna talk about this in a little
bit from funky beauty and from YSL and
everybody else that came out with
something new it's gonna be on my face
today and I didn't realize I didn't know
that was going in this direction but
everything on my face is geared towards
somebody with a really oily skin this is
a super matte look I really like how it
looks on my face but I do have dry skin
so it's a little like I have Botox just
like my whole face is really really
tight but it looks really good and it's
gonna look great in pictures but I have
lipstick on ki if you guys have oily
skin this is gonna be the perfect makeup
tutorial this makeup tutorial is just
for you if you have dry skin well you're
just gonna look you're gonna look really
good but you're gonna feel like a tight
appraisin this is like an everyday glam
look for me
I could definitely wear this every day I
hope you guys enjoy it before we get
into this video don't forget to
subscribe to my channel and hit that
notification both need to be a part of
the quad family and let's get on with
I'm actually filming in the morning for
the first time in a long time and it
makes me super happy cuz when I film in
the morning so I feel like I have the
most energy and lately I've been filming
at night when I'm just kind of like
ready to go to bed might have a huge
thing of coffee and I am ready to show
you guys some new makeup and give you my
honest opinion on them as I put them on
I already did my brows and they go ahead
and start with the eyes so I'm gonna use
this Too Faced just peachy matte palette
this is from the peaches and cream
collection I have the whole collection
but I'm using and reviewing some
products not all of them ooh that is
very that's a very strong peach smell I
just like moosh peach in my face
this shows different little things that
I would actually use so I have the
palette here and it looks like this
there's a lot of warm tone shade I like
the orange a peach right here and there
are some Browns you can take
from day two not a glam night but
definitely a little bit more dramatic
look before I put any color on my eyes
I'm going to prime my eyes first and set
them with concealer so I'm gonna do that
really quick it's so important to me to
have a setting color in the palette and
they have a perfect one right here so
I'm gonna take each butter and I'm
setting my concealer with it just so
that everything is nice and smooth by is
evenly and it's set in place so I'm
picking up is peach tea and I'm gonna
work that into the crease this is a warm
crease shade and using very light
pressure I'm going to use circular
motions to work it into the crease and
extending it out to the end of the tail
into the brow and if you get a little
bit on the lid it's fine because we're
gonna cover the entire lid anyways if
anything it'll help with a gradient
effect so the eye shadow blends very
easy and it's not patchy at all go-to
color payoff the next color I'm picking
up is peach cobbler and I'm gonna work
that all over the lid up into the crease
with this one we're gonna be layering a
lot of these colors on top of one
another just so that we can create that
seamless gradient on our I've easily
lays color down on the eye and then once
you're ready to blend it out you can
take it with soft pressure and just move
your brush back and forth and it blends
it out so nice because it's not a round
brush you have a little bit more
precision so I'm gonna go in an angle
right here this is gonna make any color
on top just look like a warm buttery pie
so I'm gonna take peachy punch next this
is a super vibrant pink coral color work
that into the crease live in this look
up a lot and I'm not gonna put that on
the lid I'm just going to have this kind
of be the halo of the eyeshadow I
definitely grabbed this palette as one
of my everyday kind of palettes for the
rest of the lip color I'm going to take
just right which is this reddish plum
color right here and I'm gonna work that
on the lid or the brow bone I'm gonna
take the lightest shade in the palette
which is peach meringue it's like a
yellow tone shade I always like to have
most of the highlight right on the arch
and then I blend the shadow out into the
other area
and then I'll blend it down as far as I
need to if I like when a little too high
with the Cree shadow so I'm gonna do a
wing on my eye I'm gonna use this new
estee lauder Victoria Beckham it's the
eye ink matte eyeliner I actually really
like the Victoria Beckham estee lauder
line because I have the bronzer and I
have the eye shadows from her and they
are so beautiful pigmented and just sit
flawless on the skin so I'm excited to
try this liner the liner is a very
pointy so I also like that you can make
a really crisp clean line this is an
intense black eyeliner and I like when
eileen is drying that it dries super
matte so much that it dries out super
fast so you have to keep putting it in
the little tube but I really like it
they also came out with a mascara with
Victoria Beckham's line so it looks like
this it's just like a skinny little tube
I mean it's a skinny little tube and
it's a skinny little wand as well and
these kind of mascaras work really well
for the lower lash line let's see what
it does for our upper lashes it is a
very wet mascara meaning it will weigh
your lashes down a little bit but it
definitely grabs every lash but it is a
little wet so I think this will work
really well for the lower lashes okay
just just as I thought this works
beautifully for the lower lashes because
the lower lashes are so thin and fine it
grabs every single lash and brings it
out it's it's look at my lashes you can
see almost every single individual lash
that is amazing for the lower lash I'm
gonna take these lashes right here in
the pink box
the pink boxes are usually more
natural-looking I'm gonna take opulence
they're so pretty the next new thing
that I'm gonna try out is the YSL all
ours primer
oh my bad you're supposed to twist it so
it looks like this
oh very thin very very can formula I
feel like it's brightening my face like
my skin just got brighter with this and
I'm gonna use the concealer and the
foundation so this dries instantly on
your skin and I almost feel like it's
going to be one of those mattifying
primer
so if you have oily skin this would work
well for you I have dry skin so it
doesn't have the best feeling on my skin
because it feels a little tight and then
for the foundation I'm gonna use all
hours Foundation and I've already tried
this guy out I already know he's good
he's really good and it's a very full
coverage they sent in one of those
foundation brushes but I didn't like the
way it applied to my face with a face
brush so I'm going to use the Beauty
Blender which they also sent in and
start to work this on my face if you are
looking for a full coverage foundation
that is going to cover up acne redness
hyperpigmentation or scars this would be
really great for you and if you have
oily skin it's gonna work like a dream
but first it kind of looks like it's
going to be a little dewy
but it definitely dries matte trust me
very much to the point where I actually
needed to spritz on some kind of hide
hydrating mist then again I do have a
dry skin type I'm gonna let this dry on
my face it does take a minute to set it
is a matte foundation but it looks very
dewy right now so I'm gonna go ahead and
do my under my lower lash line actually
before I finished doing this part I want
to try the Douai estelle concealer
thought they sent as well since the
shade 40 PA for I think I'm gonna try
this on my under eye I see the good
thing about this is that it is buildable
same thing with the foundation
everything is really buildable it also
doesn't feel a heavy on the face so that
is the definite plus okay so now that we
have our under eyes concealed I can move
on to the lower lash line so I'm gonna
take just peachy and work that
underneath the lower lash line on the
outer part of the lower lash line I'm
going to take peach tart and just work
that really close to the outer part of
the lower lash line I'm not gonna bring
it in at all I just want to add to that
cat cat eye look and then with that just
peachy shade I'm gonna blend out the
edge of this Brown so it's not harsh
so now I'm going to contour my face I
just bought the centipede II contour
sticks they are magnetic which is super
cool it has a really cool shape to it
I've never seen anything like this I
think it's really unique and cool and I
like the packaging it's nude I like my
nudes so I have mocha for my contour and
it looks like so I shut up let me see
how much product is how I work that back
down I like the shade of it it's an ashy
tone shade so it's gonna look really
natural I'm gonna go ahead and work that
on my cheek bone I want a higher
cheekbone so I'm gonna bring it up a
little bit higher until it's going to
blend into a really nice natural-looking
shadow I just like blending with these
little tiny ones because I feel like
there's so much more precise I don't
want to get this color in the wrong
places so that's why I'm using a smaller
beauty blender for this it looks like a
natural nice shadow it works really well
for my skin tone so far she also has
this shape called bamboo this is the
matte skin stick and then I'll just
blend that out with the same little
Beauty Blender and then they have a
shimmer stick that looks like this this
is a shade trip int so I'll put it in
the same spots like as we highlighted
earlier I'm gonna work it in with my
ratchet Rachel finger I'm gonna do the
other side love how it does that like
I'm in midair and then I'm about to okay
for mine to set my face I'm actually
gonna set my entire face with the peach
blur from Too Faced I tried this before
it came out and when I first tried it I
was like why is this all shimmery
how is this gonna blur my face is gonna
make my face look crazy I was very
skeptical about this but I actually
tried it and I absolutely loved the way
it made my skin look it makes your skin
literally look like you have a filter on
your skin set my entire face with this
and it does have a very strong sweet
peach scent to it
I feel like this the sense in in this
peach collection are way stronger than
the first one for sure
literally makes your skin like you have
a filter on it I love this peach blur so
much okay I went and brightened my under
eyes a little bit with some powder but
it's stuff that I've already used it's
not new so I didn't want to use it
this first impressions of new makeup
kind of video so I did that off-camera
if you want to know what I used I'll
always put it in the description to add
some color to the cheeks and to bring
some life back into my face I'm gonna
take the Too Faced sweetiepie compact
and it looks like so it's a it's
supposed to be a matte bronzer but it's
called a radiant matte bronzer so it
sits on your face matte but it also has
these illuminating particles to it but
it doesn't make it look like shimmer
it's not shimmer on your face honestly I
could see somebody being a little put
off by all of the peach scent all at one
time but I'm the type of person that
loves sweet smelling things that I'm
okay with it
but I can definitely see how it would be
a little too much for some people this
just it speaks to me on so many levels
so now for the highlight I have two
highlights from fenty beauty one of them
is called trophy wife and the other one
is is like a duo highlight and her line
is called kilowatt the the highlighting
I guess category of her line so there's
this a really bright gold color right
here let me just swatch it on my arm
it's very sheer it's more of like a
glittery type of highlight and then
there's this one right here this is
hustle a baby it has like a peach
undertone this is the one that I think
I'm gonna use today and then there's
like a softer shade which is called new
money and I think what I'm gonna do is
use a mixture of both because they're
both really really pretty really gonna
try to incorporate all of them on my
face today so let's just see what we
come up with here first I'm gonna take
this one right here her highlights are
no joke this highlight is definitely
poppin I'm also gonna try the trophy
wife because it's just how can you not
try this whoa that is intense this is
the most intense highlight I have ever
used in my life I think honestly no joke
not even trying to overhype this thing I
don't know what to do with myself
without this highlight for the lip I'm
gonna use something that's not new it's
the stripped down Mac lip liner so I'm
just gonna pop that on really quick for
the lipstick I'm gonna use the Too Faced
lipstick in the shade send a fun day and
the tube looks
this this is such a pretty nude it has
little peaches all around it I'm gonna
put that on my lips right on top of the
lip liner this is the lighter shade is
called Dollface I'm going to take that
on and pop it on to the center of the
lips and this lipstick is nice and
creamy and hydrating there is a peach
miss that I want to try out this is also
mattifying if you don't shake this up
you will have white splotches on your
face so you make sure to shake it up
test it on your arm before you spritz it
on your face I'm gonna spritz it on just
