to my channel so today I'm gonna show
you all the new things on my face
because this is a full face of first
impressions I have a ton of new makeup
actually something that just came in
this morning was from at k'kaw literally
this morning and she's on my face also
her sister the Nani palette on my eyes
which I will tell you how much I loved
this later in the video and then some
NARS some huda beauty maybelline Tarte
all the new stuff right here and I
created this look with it that I really
really like so if you want to learn how
to get this look then don't forget to
subscribe to my channel and hit that
notification bell so you can be a part
of a quad family and without further ado
let's get on Vidya I'm using on my face
is this Maybelline master Prime hydrate
and smooth primer base like it just
comes out white like this I'm gonna take
it in my hands and press it into my face
doesn't have any scent to it any weird
scent which is good and because there
isn't any new brow products that I'm
crazy about using I just did my brows
off-camera it's very lightweight it
doesn't have like that's tacky feel to
it almost like putting on a facial cream
oh I'm so excited for this next product
I've been using it I haven't used it in
a video yet but I am very excited to
show you this because it is amazing I've
been using it everyday
it's the NARS natural radiant long wear
foundation this is full coverage it's
not super matte on your face so it's not
super drying like it's tugging looks
like really nice even skin tone that's
what it looks like
I'm using the shade Barcelona and I'm
mixing it actually because my tan is
fading so I'm gonna mix a little bit of
Patagonia I think that's how you say it
I'm gonna mix these two colors together
Barcelona it looked really great on me
now it just it's starting to look a
little cray-cray so I'm gonna take my
Beauty sponge right here and just start
to work it into my face
very lightweight nice coverage doesn't
tug on the skin doesn't have any smell
I'm gonna take this all over my eye
because I just want to even out my skin
tone all over yeah you have this natural
glow that I really love and it just
looks like I have nice skin I was a
little nervous because it does say
natural and radiant those two things are
usually like that's gonna be like no
coverage but this is surprisingly easy
coverage so I'm gonna do one layer of
that just to even out the skin if I need
a little bit more later than once it
dries down I'll put a little bit more
but for now I'm just going to move on to
my eyes because this isn't a new product
I really like to prime my eyes with the
turqu shape tape this is not a new
product everybody knows about it
everybody loves it so I'm just gonna
prime eyes really quick clean underneath
my brows and be right back so I have the
naughty palette right here so pretty
simply have the nice palette as well I
feel like I want to use this for like a
winter makeup look or something so
actually I think I might save this
palette and see what I can do with just
the naughty palette so I'm gonna go
ahead and take it be naughty palette
right here it has like a velvet texture
on the font and it's just so pretty I
love the green of the green I was hoping
that it would be in the palette and it
is in the palette it matches the actual
palette so well so I'm gonna start off
with merriment this shade right here I'm
just gonna wash this color in the crease
fun I just think it's a fun color and
I've always wanted to use mint in one of
my looks so like why not so I'm just
gonna wash this through the crease and
it's actually really very faint and
almost just like a white I'm gonna go in
with tipsy next one of the lighter
Gray's in the palette and I'm taking a
smaller brush to work tipsy in there on
the outer edge to add some depth in
there and I have the brush very lightly
sweeping over my base because I don't
want to put too much pressure than in
the
to get really intense and I want to
gradually work the color up into the
crease a lighter hand is always better
and I always work in a circular motion
out towards the end of my eye just
because I feel like it's a little bit
easier and I use a little bit more
pressure out here too now I'm going to
go in with his beautiful emeralds it's
just it's just Christmas
this is ho ho ho to me and I kind of
flick it outward so that it creates this
cat shape I can already feel this is
super pigmented so I'm using the
lightest hand ever short a little back
and forth motions and I'm gonna bring
this out here I'm gonna keep this area
very open and clear because I'm gonna
pop that beautiful gold in the middle I
hope it's as beautiful as it looks in
the palette this is the Vasanti brush
there's no number two it just says
Vasanti on it I have been loving this
brush to blend out my shadows so I'm
just going to take that and go around
this shadow and really diffuse the edges
for the outer corners I'm going to use
coal the darkest gray in the palette and
I'm going to work that on the outer
corners I want the darkest point to be
right on the inner corner and the outer
corner and you really want to make sure
you blend out these edges and that might
take you a while just go back and forth
in little short motions like this I'm
gonna add jingle right in the center
it's so pretty but actually because I
kind of swatch the jingle this is jingle
I feel like you can kind of see through
it so it's not super pigmented but it
does still have that pretty golden color
in it so I want to use it but I want to
use a base on the center's so this is
called top yacht it's the chrome paint
shadow pot from Tarte and it looks like
that it's very similar it's a little bit
more opaque than the shadow so I'm just
gonna put this down and then lay jingle
right on top of it I'm gonna take this
Sigma duo fiber brush and just soften
out the edges of this and I don't want
this color to go everywhere so try to
keep it right on the center be careful
how far you're bringing out your brush
because I feel like this could get
everywhere
then take coal again with my wing liner
brush now I'm gonna add some mascara and
lashes I'm gonna be using the new Marc
Jacobs section it's not new it's it's
new to me because they put my name on it
and I feel super special about it I
think this is one of my favorite
mascaras to use to mesh my real and
false lashes together the lashes that
I'm using are not new so I'm just gonna
put them on off-camera but these are the
House of lashes ikonics for the lower
lash line I'm going to take coal
concealer wise I'm going to be using the
new concealer shade from NARS this is
the NARS radiant creamy concealer this
is in the shade light 2.6 Cafe con Leche
have darkness under here and it goes
straight down so I'm going upwards with
the concealer to make it look a little
bit more lifted feel like this is
actually my perfect match oh my gosh I
haven't told you guys I am wearing my
friend Yasmin Beauty burdock here on
YouTube her and her husband came out
with a line of clothing and she has
these sweater crop tops I'm wearing
right now it's so cute as stay dreamin
stay hustlin I like to cover my arms so
I always have like I like long sleeves
but I don't want to be super hot so I
like that it's crop top so I'm gonna
link them below if you want to check out
her sweatshirts I'm gonna set everything
in place so I'm going to take my Laura
Mercier powder and my slightly damp
Beauty Blender so what baking does for
me fills in those lines and makes
everything look really smooth so I'm
gonna let that sit and bake on my face
so while that's doing that I'm gonna go
ahead and contour with my shade and
light palette you guys know my contour
routine I do it all the time so I'm just
gonna be back with a contour face this
is a new blush palette from NARS it's
from the mannery collection and it has
Laguna in it lovesick and surreal
highlight I'm just gonna be using this
blush right here this is lovesick and
I'm gonna pop that on to my cheeks I
know it looks kind of crazy in the pan
on the pan but on the face it's actually
not so intense
the highlight that I'm gonna use is from
huda beauty it's her winter highlight
palette and look at this I love her
palettes they're so cool the first day
is frosted kissed which is like a cream
and I'm gonna use I'm just gonna
softly Pat that on my cheekbone and then
I'm gonna take Northern Lights this
really pretty gold woah woah that cream
really makes it pop so you want to be
careful with this the bridge this is a
very intense highlight color that I want
to use is called savage the white on
this collection very like Frosty the
Snowman kind of vibes so I'm going to
take that on my lips see hopefully it's
not too dark
now I'm going to add a gloss to the
center of my lips for that I'm gonna
take Kylie sister Kim's a new launch
actually just got this in my door I mean
I just got this out my door this morning
I have this gold right here from k'kaw
it's a gloss called the yellow gold it's
very very pretty let me just do a
close-up on it this is what it looks
like so I'm just gonna take the yellow
gold and I'm just gonna pop it on the
center and I'm gonna take my finger just
to soften up thank you guys for watching
I hope you enjoyed this video if you did
you know what to do give it a big thumbs
up for me also if you missed some other
videos I have them over to the side if
you're just not ready to go yet and
before I let you go I want to let you
know that you don't have to have things
you don't have to have everything
figured out right now it's fine if
you're like in a moment of the
uncertainty and you don't know what to
do in your life because this is the
moment that is going to get you to where
you need to be I wish I would have told

was in your position and I know how that
feels don't feel like you have to have
