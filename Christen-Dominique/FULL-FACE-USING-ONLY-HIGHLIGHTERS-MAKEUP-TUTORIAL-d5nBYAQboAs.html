not my version no I promise I will put
the picture right here you can also
click on her face to watch her video so
guys we're in Japan the video when
Kristen gets finished digging lipstick a
party ok guys so the first thing I want
to put on my face are these two
highlighters from Becca this one is the
backlight priming filter and then this
one is shimmering skin perfecter and
together it's gonna make my highlight
bling so much it's gonna blind you so
I'm gonna mix them together on my hand
like this I'm gonna put it on with this
iconic London brush right here so I'm
just gonna mix them together and
especially when I first saw this
challenge I was like this will look
crazy on me and then Laura was like we
should do it we should do the
highlighter challenge I was like you
should do it yes I am putting more
highlight bling on my hand I'm gonna
look like The Tin Man I could already
feel it okay I'm done with the brush
because that's kind of hard to do around
the brows yes
bring the glow so now I'm just gonna put
foundation on my face I'm just going to
use my Tarte Amazonian clay full
coverage foundation right on top of that
Cindy's my fingers today I have my mom
and my uncle sitting right in front of
me right now you know they're if you've
been following my snapchats they've come
to visit me me and Brett men were
shopping in New York and I noticed he
had his ears highlighted I'd never seen
that before and I think
do that today with some concealer on
really quick use my NARS creamy radiant
concealer you guys know the drill right
in the inner corners all right so now
I'm going to go on to the face powder
today's a highlight as my powder I think
I'm gonna go into mary-lou manizer
this guy right here I'm gonna take my
brush and drown it in this highlight
here we go pin man here I come
oh my gosh this looks awesome I think
that I'm pretty glowy at this point but
I want to kick it up a little notch so
I'm gonna take this you a-listening
brightening powder and just round myself
in it I don't know about you guys but
the glowy are I get the more glamorous I
feel don't forget to get your ears oh my
god I don't know why I never highlighted
my ears before okay so now we're gonna
get into the eyes eyes I'm gonna go into
the darker shade of glow kits from
anastacio this is that glow and I'm
gonna take golden bronze so right here
for the crease I'm going to kind of fade
it down to my lid a little bit
I'm gonna go into the betty loumanizer
and i'm going to work this into the
outer part of the crease going down into
the outer part of the lid as well I feel
like a Dior commercial right now for the
inner part of the lid I'm going to take
honest Asya peach nectar I'm going to
bring it into the socket as well
okay so I'm going to add a little bit of
pink on the lid for that I'm gonna use
the artist Couture supernova diamond
glow powder and just pack on this peak
to the lid
and I'm going to buff it out for the
inner corners I'm taking gold digger
which I kind of feel like this needs to
be all over my face and my inner corner
okay so for my brow bone I'm going to
use the Becca highlight in moonstone
looks like so okay I feel like I need
more color on my lid I just don't see
the color on there and I need more
mermaid fantasy by artist Couture like
sir it has these like gold reflex in it
so pretty go ahead and take some of that
on our brush and just pop it on to the
very center
I'm going to go ahead and spritz some
mist and fix from Make Up For Ever on
this brush take it into mermaid fantasy
and add even more on the center of the
lid and I'm also going to take a little
bit of gold digger and work that
underneath my eyes just so that we don't
have any dark circles okay and then for
my contour I'm going to take golden
bronze and work that onto the hollows of
my cheeks bring that around forehead
now we're going to go ahead and contour
the nose golden bronze and take it down
my nose so I'm going to do is take the
JT 182 and snatch the nose
and then take a clean fluffy brush so I
can blend and buff out this color on the
edges and I'm going to bring this
contour down my neck and the jawline you
guys should see what I'm looking at
right now this is ridiculous you know
what thing I'm going to snapchat it this
is insane you have got to try you got to
try the grow lactic luster base glow it
will change your life
like we need anymore but we're going to
go ahead and glow the face just a little
bit challenge to highlight my ears I'm
gonna take luster here they're just a
little bit everywhere look how beautiful
that you're is I'm gonna go ahead and
put on some eyeliner so now I'm just
gonna put some mascara on so now I'm
gonna put on my lashes the lashes I'm
gonna put on are these ones right here

style I can't remember but I'll have it

mist and fix on this brush and dip it
