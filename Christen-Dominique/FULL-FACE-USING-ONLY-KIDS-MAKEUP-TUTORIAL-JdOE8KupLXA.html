kindergarten I'm going to show you how
lay that picture day was like Harley
Quinn when she was a baby today I am
doing the full face using only kids
makeup the packaging is so so cute and
this is what you're paying for because
it's pretty expensive and it's a little
ridiculous this is actually my favorite
palette right here pretty much all of
this is from Claire's in the icing
because that's the only place I could
really find kids makeup but I was very
surprised at what they had I feel like
they had a lot of stuff that I didn't
have when I was younger you have to be
really resourceful when using this stuff
because it's not very pigmented it's
definitely a challenge I have five
pallets in front of me with all these
different colors and I just went crazy
so I decided to use all the colors on my
eyes today I think it's kind of cute and
I found these little bracelet thingies
that are super cute and I kind of want
my nails like this next I might go get
my nails I'm going to show them this and
tell them to recreate it on my nails
isn't it called something like
holographic nails or metallic nails or
something so anyways I'm going to go
ahead and jump into the tutorial if you
want to see how I got its first day of
kindergarten
look then go ahead and keep watch I feel
like I'm about to film a Harley Quinn
makeup tutorial I I have so many kids
makeup in this room right now it's
unreal I don't even know where to start
I have all these cute little palettes I
was very surprised that they had a
primer in a setting spray at Claire's
kids makeup is definitely stepping up
its game so there's a face primer from
Claire's I feel like oh this smells
weird
it smells like tar this is cute I feel
like they make this makeup so that kids
can follow along to makeup tutorials on
YouTube that's what I feel like because
who would actually make a face primer
for kids it's crazy
we're going to start off with you
foundation first let's try to get our
face together I have these two BB creams
from the icing that I'm going to mix
together and
to make foundation out of I have a
superlight one and then a dark one so
I'm going to see how that goes oh this
is not bad this is probably my skintone
it's like a medium shade I probably
won't even have to mix or that could be
my contour the only brushes that I have
to use are these which is not very much
of a selection by the way these are $10
$10 mm-hmm I think I'm going to go ahead
and use other brushes kids use their
hands so I'll use my hand let's put on
this BB cream first please have some
coverage please some coverage okay this
okay this BB cream is actually doing a
good job at somewhat covering up my
darkness and it's covered up some things
and I'm just going to do a little bit of
cream contour with the darker BB cream
all with your finger this does something
for us at least gives us a little bit of
color come on cut that nose little bail
we're done with the foundation I'm gonna
move on to the eyebrows there's a little
cute brush I can use for my brows right
here let's see what we have for the
brows okay there is this adorable little
palette right here but this is no brow
colors in it 17 dollars by the way one
looks like it has some mattes in it
let's see if we can find no there is no
bro okay let's go to this palette and
see what we have no no not this palette
either let no anybody have a brown of
some sort let's go ahead and take this
one out it's from the fashion angels
palette how much was this probably so
expensive so here is the little palette
I'm going to take this brown shade right
here how there no such thing as matte
shades and kids makeup so we're gonna
take this taupey brown color with a
little bit of shimmer in it and we're
gonna do our brows wish me luck
oh this is very I'm probably gonna have
to go into the black eyeliner because I
don't think this is gonna work for me
okay I am for sure gonna have to go into
the black eyeliner and just it's
literally doing nothing at all this
eyeliner is gonna have to save you this
feels like it's going to break apart by
the way
since I don't have a spoolie I'm going
to use this little brush right here to
attempt to comb through the brows
actually use this side okay just I'm
going to take some of that BB cream from
earlier and just try to clean up my own
drip under my brow area what I've
learned is if you press really hard you
will get enough coverage to cover the
bald spots in your brow we're gonna move
on we're gonna move on to the eye shadow
let's see what I want to do something
colorful and fun cute makeup brushes by
the way they're so adorable we need to
get a close-up of the brushes they're so
cute but I can't use my whole face with
these brushes okay this one I'm
definitely using for my face powder
see those two face powders yeah oh no
this is a sponge this one seems to have
some pretty bright colors in it and it's
so cute
oh I'm going to use this blush right
here for my crease okay wait before we
put on any eyeshadow let me just put
this on my eyes this face powder right
here from this cute little pink little
heart palette this little blue heart
soaked yeah put that all over our eyes
to set our eyes so they're not creasing
like they are right now I can't believe
they give face powder to kit now I'm
going to take this bronzy working blush
from this palette right here I'm gonna
mix this and that brow shade I tried to
use on my eyebrows right here but I put
that in my crease actually it's not
doing a bad job of blending out not a
bad job at all and you got yourself a
really nice crease color I want to go
bright on my eyes I want something very
vibrant as vibrant as we can get it I'm
going to try to use this yellow on the
inner corner and then this turquoise on
the outer corner okay I'm going to take
this little brush right here this is
probably a concealer
and I actually just in case I have
makeup setting spray from Claire's so
I'm gonna spritz it on here just in case
it's not pigmented enough go ahead and
take my yellow and pop it on to my inner
corners this isn't bad this isn't bad at
all I think the makeup setting spray
definitely helped I was gonna keep
packing that on top already is the same
bra the other side I'm gonna go into
that turquoise just rub it in there nice
and hard I'm gonna put it on the outer
part of the eye go bright or go home
this is pretty pigmented I am very
surprised am i hitting pan already
elastic I'm gonna go back in with this
brush right here and just blend
everything out as best as I can
soften the middle here okay soon as you
blend it out it just completely wipes it
away so change of plans
we are going to do pink on the outer
corner because I'm going to use this
really bright pink right here and put it
on the outer part of the eye we are
making purple today an art class so
we're just going to blend that out I
personally kind of like the way it looks
with the reddish pinkish shade on top of
everything I don't know it just gives it
something a DC vibes okay I actually
think this is turning into a Harlequin
and makeup tutorial I'm just going to do
multicolored eyeshadow on my eyelids
today because there's so many colors and
I can't choose which one I want so I'm
gonna do purple on the crease I'm gonna
take this purple right here and blend
that into my crease this is what happens
when you put 30 palettes in front of me
and there are so many colors to choose
from I just want to use all of them this
is gonna be one big rainbow on my face
come on rainbow that's actually not bad
not bad at all I think this is good we
have a lot of fallout on our face I'm
gonna use that light blush on my eye
brow the only thing this these nails are
good for or digging and looking pretty
totally make you handicapped
every other aspect of your life so I'm
just going to take some of this shade
right here and I'm going to work that to
my brow bone now I'm going to try to put
on this a liquid liner may I have a
bigger and bigger and straighter insert
here - great - the lashes I'm just going
to use these are not from Claire's these
are just regular ones from violet boss
i'll have them listed below if you guys
want to see what kind knees are so i'm
going to go ahead and take this face
powder just rub get into it like my life
depends on this powder i'm just going to
Pat it onto my face hopefully it sets
everything in place i think i'm taking
off the BB cream more than anything but
we'll make it work
i just broke the whole palette oh wait a
minute I have a little really light
eyeshadow here I can use for under my
eyes pack that on it's this palette
right here I'm gonna take this shadow
and just smell so good by the way smells
like candy I'm gonna take this shout out
and just work it into my eyes with the
same brush this powder is bringing my
under eyes back to life I love it hmm
since we're here I'm just going to go
down the nose on the Cupid's bow I'm
going to go back into the eyes on the
lower lash line and I'm going to put a
bright purple right here
okay so for sure this setting spray
helps with the eye shadow for sure now
I'm going to take some glitter I have
this glitter stick right here there we
go I'm just going to take that purple
glitter right there and I'm going to pop
that on to the bottom part of my lash
line and take a little bit of settings
right you never know this might help
that's kind of cute this is really
speaking to my childhood right now this
is giving me so many memories because I
would love to play with this kind of
stuff oh I like it
gara my cute little mirror and for the
cheeks there is this really pretty
bright pink I'm gonna use to actually
I'm going to use this pink blush on my
cheeks today I'm going to go ahead and
take my powder brush and just dig into
that baby pink and work that onto my
cheeks okay so next I'm going to do the
highlight for the highlight there is
this beautiful highlight and it's this
one right here already swatched it well
it's a little pinky so I'm going to go
ahead and take that and highlight with
it I'm going to add a little bit of this
white to just gonna add both of them
together there we go
woohoo yes give it to me don't give it
to me that much a little bit right there

these nails I don't know how to handle
these nails when your nails are too
fierce for your own self and we are
looking good next and the final step is
the lips there's this lipstick right
