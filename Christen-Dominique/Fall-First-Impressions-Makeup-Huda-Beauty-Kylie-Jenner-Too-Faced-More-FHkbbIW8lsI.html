channel so today I am gonna be doing
this look right here which I ended up
really loving and didn't know that I was
gonna love it this much but it's a full
face of what I think is fall first
impressions to create this I want to go
by a campfire in Tosa marshmallows and
cozy up and still a blam kind of look as
soon as I saw this palette right here
which is freaking adorable
I already saw this look right here oh my
eyes but I love this look I know you
guys are gonna love it I can see it on
your eyeballs right now you look good I
can tell your future self is gonna look
so good ready first of all we're using
the new una Beauty beau filter
foundation there's some Kylie in here a
bunch of stuff benefit New York color
pop there's a lot of things and you're
gonna love it so let's keep going with
this video don't forget to subscribe to
my channel and hit that notification bow
so you could be a part of the quad
family and without further ado let's get
on with the video the new benefit
foolproof brow powder in number 5 so
they have this brow with the lightest
part in the front and the darkness in
the back I think that's really cute and
it also comes with this brush right here
to fill in the brows I honestly don't
know how I feel about it I'm gonna try
it with this brush just see what it does
because obviously it comes in a certain
way so I want to use it the way that it
comes packaged you're supposed to
achieve more of a soft brow with this
powder and now I'm gonna do the back
hmm I don't know if this is gonna work
for me I think gets to be really precise
with this I mean I could see where it
fills in but it's just and it is filling
it in and I'm sure like you can work at
it and get fill it in the way you want
it um I think I'm just even off my brow
pencil but I see how it fills in it is
soft but I just I just want it like now
but I'd rather use my own brush you know
I just need a little bit more practice
like this little guy please hold
I will be back with some brows okay so
for the primer I'm going to use this guy
right here which when I first saw it I'm
not gonna lie I was like I'm not gonna
use that because it's black it looks
weird how was it a primer but then I
looked closer and it says it's a
moisturizing primer and it's a hybrid
between the two so I like that idea of
having a moisturizing primer you guys
know I love moisturizing primers so I
decided to use it with you guys and it's
black so I thought it would be cool to
use on camera this is from the brand
make help shield against damage caused
by HIV and the impact of IR light while
also aiding in vitamin D synthesis I
really not sure what that means still
but it seems like it's just really going
to protect your skin put it in my hand
like so okay I see it's a gel it's like
a black gel so it's not gonna come off
on your face like a black well sort of
but it blends in in the skin oh my god
it feels insanely hydrating I feel my
skin soaking it up right away and it has
the most amazing bounce back kind of
feeling like a little babies but I
definitely love the way this feels on my
skin and I'm glad I did it and toss it
it would be really sad and I'd be
missing out on your really good primer
so I'm glad I used it so that's cool
we like the primer I'm gonna let that
sit and dry and I'm gonna put on the
huda beauty foundation I'm really
to use that I've heard so many good
things about it they gave me the shade a
latte and toasted coconut
I like the bottle she always has really
nice packaging
I like the fade right here how it's a
black and it fades up and it's a little
bit matte towards the bottom at the top
it's a little more glossy the nice
bottle of foundation I'm going to look
up this brand before I use it on my face
because it I'd hate to not say the print
look how huge this is first of all I'm
gonna be using this new beauty sponge
that I got in my PR packages I don't
know the brand I'm gonna look it up
right now
but this is how huge it gets like really
freaking huge this looks like a doorknob
like I can open or I can like pick a
lock with this it's so freakin pointy
and I thought it would be really cool to
get into these little areas so I wanted
to try this out it's also really easy to
hold is how it comes which looks pretty
big and then it gets even bigger when
you wet it and it feels really nice
almost like the Beauty Blender
so really interested to try this but
first let me look up the brand okay guys
I just figured out who this is from this
is from LC cosmetics so I know it has to
be good because I'll see how some
bom-bom products that I am I'm very
excited about this no wonder it's from
LC makes sense it is humongous it's
pointy she L see the owner of LC is Lily
and she is an amazing makeup artist so
it makes sense that she knows to make it
this tiny and sharp because she gets it
she gets it
she's amazing I can't wait to use it
this is the full filter high coverage
foundation let's see how high coverage
this really is let's go ahead and put it
on the hand and then we are going to
pick it up with this side this looks
like it is big enough for my face
it hasn't really pretty floral sent to
the foundation so if you're into floral
scents you would love this if you're not
into floral scents it might bug you a
little bit but this is high coverage for
sure is this too light for me I feel
like we need to go with toasted coconut
I love the names this is gonna get all
over my 50 necklaces that I have on my
neck today excited to try this in my
inner corners let's see oh my god I love
this thing
my initial thought was that it was going
to be a little flimsy getting to the
inner corners because this is super
narrow this thing is absolutely amazing
it stole me right now in front of your
guys's eyes with this little inner
corner I knew it was gonna steal me with
this thing I want to go around my nose I
want to go in here I want to go
everywhere with this thing oh my god I
love it it's almost like you can use
this instead of using concealer you
could just use foundation this is more
amazing than what I thought it would be
and I thought it was gonna be really
good but this is like life-changing okay
it's dried and I do feel like my face is
getting a little tight around my cheek
area and a little bit around my eyes
just like feels like a little a little
bit of a facelift kind of feel I
honestly don't even want to use a
concealer because it covers so well
under the eyes I think I'm just I was
gonna use a new concealer but skin it
there are so many palettes that just
came out I mean so many it was really
hard to choose which one to use but for
some reason can you take a guess why
this palette just kept calling my name
like how can you resist this palette
look how adorable it is the owner of Too
Faced jared has a dog named clover he's
in love with and his dog is super
adorable colors are so pretty
Eugene is just adorable and the colors
are vibrant
the colors the first Cottam I start off
with is Chihuahua and work it right into
the crease and work it down onto the lid
as well it's just a matte taupe shade
see how that doesn't really look like
much but it's gonna do miracles whenever
we worked in and those other cliches
it's gonna look so beautiful and smooth
like a celebrity makeup the next car my
go into you is good boy which is this
yellow color right here and work that
into the crease as well that's a little
bit of a shimmer to it you feel like
this is a very sheer color like a
mustard yellow color mixed with that
Chihuahua shade very pretty especially
for fall I'm gonna take the yellow and
work at the lower lash line I almost
feel like I'm about to do a Halloween
look right now next color I'm gonna use
is cuddle bunny and work that into the
crease as well
or the lid I'm gonna go with save them
all just a really pretty rich brown with
gold flecks in it
I'll add torch okay that makes me look
like I have an eye infection instead of
that I'm gonna use this brown shade for
rubbed on the inner corner I'm gonna
take this glitter right here from Urban
Decay it's called ac/dc I was like a
little bit of a rosy undertone I
couldn't seem to be so proud of me
because I have a cousin who's awesome ik
fartist and she is always find me to use
color glitter she's like loves that
stuff I just got in litters from la
splash like this is a little bit more
rosy kind of the look I want to go for
it so I'm gonna take some of that violet
Voss glitter glue and put it right on
top this glitter right here from le
splash this is called the crystallized
glitter in the shade blushing bride it's
a really pretty rose color dab it right
on top I'm gonna do a wing I'm gonna do
my wing off camera because I don't have
any new eyeliners that I'm excited to
try I will be back with some wings and
then I have some new eyelashes to show
you guys that I can't wait to try out so
I got a lot of new lashes that just came
in from a bunch of different brands and
I was really excited to try them
especially this brand right here because
it seems like the hairs on the eyelashes
are really really nice this is from less
saline I'm gonna go with this style
right here this is the Shanti or chantey
what are those two I'm also using a new
eyelash tweezer this is from the Saline
and I'm gonna try it out because you
guys know I am pretty loyal to the Tarte
one so let's see how this works I like
how it just grips and it's kind of
curved already okay I like the fact that
you can turn it on inside and get really
precise with how you want the eyelash to
sit I'm just finding all these really
amazing products I did not know about
before the next thing that I'm using
that's new is this palette right here
this is from Koki and this is actually
the first time that I'm using this brand
on my channel but this is a powder
contour palette and you open it up
almost reminds me of the Kat Von D shade
and light palette first I'm going to
brighten up these under-eye circles so
I'm gonna go into this shade in the
middle and
at this one it doesn't go on as strong
as the Kat Von D but I'm not complaining
about it it looks really nice and it
kind of makes my skin look a little bit
more soft than what it was looking
before so I'm gonna go ahead and take
this Sigma extreme structure contour
brush and I'm going to take the middle
shade right here and this dark shade and
start to cut my cheeks
this is a new blush from colour-pop it's
a really cute package I really liked the
shade of this blush and I thought it
would work really well with this look so
I'm gonna go ahead and pop this on my
cheeks okay I totally forgot to contour
my nose let me just do that off-camera
really quick for the highlight there is
two highlights that I want to try and
I'm really torn I either want to do the
new mannery collection from NARS this is
a gorgeous highlight it's called double
take and just the packaging is so
beautiful I want to use it so badly or
Dior just came out with nude air
illuminizer x' which look gorgeous oh I
can already tell this is gonna be more
intense okay
made my decision we are going with Dior
I kind of don't want to highlight this
area just have so many bumps from trying
all the skincare products like try it on
my face yesterday but I can tell that
this is something to be good very very
good this
a plus a plus I don't want to show you
this side it's just extremely bumpy it's
not cute so I'm just gonna stay like
this I'm gonna put some on the tip of my
nose but I'm gonna use my finger so I
could be a little bit more precise with
it and right on the bridge of my nose I
really love this look I now I need to
figure out what lip to do there's some
new Kylie lips and there's some new NARS
lips there's some new color pop lips I
don't know which lip to do but I will
figure it out in two seconds I figured
out a lip I'm gonna go with the Kylie
liquid lip in hazel and the lip liner so
I'm gonna put the lip liner on first

fire and just cuff some marshmallows or
