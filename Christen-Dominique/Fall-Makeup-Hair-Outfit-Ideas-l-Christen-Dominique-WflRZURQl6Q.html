and mine
so we're walking by the shore I've got
something to say words can't describe
the way that I feel when I look in her
eyes guys it welcome back to my channel
so today I'm gonna do a can you guess
yes it's a fall makeup look I'm doing
the outfit and hair so if you like this
look then let's keep watching me do this
to prime my face I'm using the Smashbox
photo-finish pore minimizer and this is
going to make sure our makeup goes on
nice and smooth for foundation as some
of you already may know it's no surprise
I'm using the cover effects natural
finish oil-free foundation I'm in the
color g4t and to get this on and even
I'm using the zoeva 102 silk finish
brush and by the way I am absolutely in
love with these brushes and I think
they're way better than the Mac ones if
you haven't tried them you should
definitely try them out so now I'm going
to cover my under-eye circles and hide
any blemishes that I have even though
actually this foundation did a pretty
good job at concealing everything but I
think I do have a little bit of darkness
around my eye still so I'm going to use
the benefit fake up and it's like a
moisturizer within a concealer so it's
really hydrating I'm just going to put
that on the inner corners and it's kind
of nice to use a gentle concealer
moisturize in it because there is really
sensitive
after I'm done with putting on my
foundation and concealer I tend to get
product in my brows I'm just going to
brush them out with the spoolie before I
start to fill them in all right so now
it's time to fill in my brows and for
that I'm going to use the honest Asya
Beauty Express palette in brunette and
I'm just going to lightly fill them in
and then comb them out with the spoolie
and then to draw in my brows because
there's parts of my brows that are just
completely bald I'm using the cargo
cosmetics brow kit and it's in the color
dark
after I'm done drawing them in I go back
with a spoolie to make sure that there
isn't any build-up in one spot and just
makes them look even
to set everything in place I'm using the
Vincent Longo velour pressed powder in
the color light tube after I'm done
setting my foundation I go and set my
concealer as well and for that I'm using
the Anastasia contour kit just the
yellow and pink powder and that's going
to also brighten up the under eyes using
the Maya mia palette I'm washing on the
color caramel or caramel however you say
it I'm going to watch that onto my
crease area and just below the lash line
this is also going to help with
transitioning the colors
for the lid I'm using the loose shimmer
in the color lush it's a warm bronzy
watermelon color and I'm gonna use my
crown brush infinity shadow slash crease
duet brush to place the pigment on my
lid in a golly that was such a long name
you
next I'm taking the color Sienna from
the palette I'm going to place this into
my crease and i'm using the zoeva 234
smokey shader brush
from my Sigma brilliant and spellbinding
palette I'm using this matte dark
mustard brown color to blend just above
the Sienna color we placed in the crease
this is going to give our look even more
of a warm cozy fall feel and add some
depth to highlight the brow bone I'm
using the honest Daza concealer and I'm
going to apply this with a concealer
brush once I have the amount that I want
I'm going to take my crown brush and use
the crease end to blend out and smooth
the ends of the concealer so that it
goes nicely into the shadow and this
brush is really great for blending these
types of products because it's synthetic
so it works great with both wet or dry
shadows next I'm picking up the
midsummer loose shimmer and for some
reason it didn't film at the beginning
of me putting this on that I got the end
of it so I'm basically just applying
this to the lower part of my lid and
just giving it more of a bronzey warm
feeling and then I'm taking my Kat Von D
tattoo liner to create my wing
next I'm using the Pacifica and natural
waterproof eye pencil from my ipsy
glambag in the color fringe I'm going to
place this on my waterline and also on
the lower lash line and this is going to
redefine our eyes and then after that
I'm taking my matte bronzer duo with the
crown brush I'm going to place this
right underneath the brown liner and
this is going to give us a glowing halo
effect which I've been obsessed with
lately and I've been using it all the
time and probably every Instagram
picture and now I am going to apply my
Urban Decay perversion mascara which I
didn't like at first but it grew on me
it's a wet formula so I wasn't a fan at
first but if you let it dry for a few
seconds and go back over it it actually
lengthens your lashes and makes them
look pretty and full so I'm kind of a
fan now and I've been using this one a
lot now I'm going to just apply some
lashes you see these are the Ardell
wispy lashes and what I do is just place
them in the center and then attach one
side at a time
to make sure there isn't any glue mark
showing I'm just going over with a black
liquid liner and that is the finished
eyelook now I'm moving on to the rest of
the face now it's time to make my face
look skinnier and add some definition to
it I'm going to take my city color
contour kit and using the contour color
first and I'm just going to apply this
on the hollows of my cheek bones around
my temples around the forehead anywhere
you want to straighten or hide here I'm
going to put it on the alongside of the
nose and underneath the nose to make it
look a little bit less pointy and I'm
blending that out with my Mac - 8 to 88
brush for the highlight I'm using this
one from the Anastasia contour kit and
I'm applying this to the bridge of my
nose center of my forehead and the tops
of my cheekbones now for the blush I'm
using the Maybelline master glaze blush
stick in the color make a mob I think it
adds a nice warm touch to our fall look
I mean and it's super easy to blend so
I'm really liking it for the lips I'm
using the bare minerals lipstick in the
color
lead the way and it's a pretty rich plum
berry color and I'm going to apply this
first and then I'm gonna go over with
the Gerard cosmetics lighted lip gloss
and this is in the color seduction and
that really just darkens the lip and I
really really like how it turned out but
with dark lipsticks or lip glosses it
can get pretty messy so I went over with
a concealer to make sure that everything
was nice and clean and then I went over
with a powder just to set it this is
optional but I went ahead and used the
Hikari lip gloss in the color sand
and I just applied that to the center
and it just gave a little bit more
dimension to the lip now for the hair
tutorial it's super quick and easy I'm
just first going to comb out any tangles
and then section my hair up taking my
good ol one inch and a half revlon
curling iron and with the first section
I'm curling away from my face so I
usually start in the middle curl up and
hold a little bit and then go back down
curl up and hold I do this until I get
to the end of the piece and then I hold
and here I'm just drinking my Thai tea
and then I let it go and you can see
that it gives you a nice pretty curl for
the next section I'm just going to curl
inward so it's alternating away from the
face and inward so here I'm just going
inward and then I'm going to let it go
and do the same thing to the next strand
I'm going to curl away and then in and
I'm not going to go through the whole
hair the whole head of hair because it's
really repetitive
so yeah just basically do that and then
once you get to the top of the hair
tease it and then grab two bobby pins
and clip it back so that you want to
make sure that you have a lot of volume
in your crown and around in the front
now I'm going to take my flyaways with
some hairspray and take a toothbrush to
comb the back thumbs up if you saw that
video and before I head out I'm going to
apply my Harvey Bennett precious gold
for her perfume I like the citrusy
floral scent it has to it so I'm sitting
on my hands trying to talk through this
video know they go crazy I don't even
make sense
yeah minds of their own we're matching
