today I'm going to be doing this follow
up for you guys
follows my favorite season this is the
first look of the fall season and I'm
going to do plenty more I just love the
dark lip and the scented candles I know
you guys are ready for those pumpkin
spice lattes because I am I just bought
a ton of candles for the fall season and
I think that makes me really excited you
guys see my desktop thumbs up if you're
excited for the fall season and if you
want to learn how to get this look then
keep watching I am using the angel veil
primer from NYX this makes your skin
literally feel like velvet and it's
going to help your foundation go on a
lot smoother
therefore the foundation I'm using the
elsi foundation it is really good very
lightweight but if you want full
coverage you just apply one coat let it
sit apply another coat with a Beauty
Blender of some kind and you will get
the maximum full coverage but you won't
get the cake base so this is one of
those must-have essential foundations
let's cover those panda eyes I'm using
the tarte maracuja creaseless concealer
this concealer is super full coverage a
little goes a long way it does have a
sticky consistency to it but if you're
looking for extreme full coverage this
guy is going to be your best buddy I'm
also going to blend it over my lids so
that I can act as a primer and then I'm
going to go over my eyebrows just
filling them in in the sparse areas and
this is the Anastasia brow Wiz and
medium brown
and I'm gonna jump straight into the
eyeshadow I'm using the salted caramel
eyeshadow from chocolate bar palette and
I'm gonna sweep that into the crease
back and forth just windshield wiper
motions make sure it's nice and soft
this is going to be our first wash of
color I'm also going to take it down to
the lash line I want the eyeshadow to
have a warm orange tone so I'm going to
pick up orange soda and sweep it over
the top of salted caramel and I'm just
doing that without any type of fluffy
brush so we put it sweeping it over the
top and then I'm gonna go in with a
reddish-brown color this is Sienna and
I'm going to work this into the crease
for the crease I like to start at the
very base of my crease and then
gradually work my weight upwards to see
how it looks as I go higher if that
makes sense because if I go too high or
I start with my brush completely
covering the crease sometimes it looks
like I have a black eye or red eye or
orange right whatever color I'm using it
just looks way too overpowering
especially because my eyes are a little
more close together so it just looks
crazy
so if you have this problem gradually
start with just a little bit of shadow
at the base of your crease and then work
your way up I'm also applying it to the
lower lash line and then I'm blending it
out with a nice big fluffy brush I want
to bring back that orange warm tone to
the eye so I'm going to go back into
orange soda and just blend it over the
top of Sienna so I'm going to take
orange soda in pop it into the inner
corners so now I'm going to go in with
Collins Avenue from CIPA it's really
beautiful gold pigment I'm going to
apply it with my finger on my lid it
started to get into my crease so I
changed up from my finger to an eye
shadow brush and this one is from zoeva
it's the 234 and now it's time for a
weird face break now I'm going to take
the makeup forever bronze duo and OH -
and just pop it on to the inner corners
it's a slightly lighter gold and I just
like the way it looks together with the
darker gold and then I'm going to create
a huge cat eye
I actually took awhile to do this I use
my Kat Von D tattoo liner and a little
bit of the Tarte gel liner which I
didn't show you guys and I
continuously flicked it out took some
concealer made it really really sharp
and shorten it down for you guys into
this tutorial and then I applied some
mascara to the tops in the bottom lashes
this tiny mascara which is really cool
is from NYX and it is awesome and then I
applied a brown liner in my waterline
and these really beautiful lashes from
velour I don't know the name of them but
I will have the name listing in the
description box for you guys and then
after I'm done with the eyes I just want
to brighten up the face so I went back
with my another concealer this one is
from urban decay and I just applied it
under my eyes got kinda bored and then
eventually made a heart on my lips and
on my forehead people do way worse
things I've seen I can't even I don't
even want to say what I've seen people
create um their highlighting contours
with creams out of but I'm sure you guys
know what I'm talking about and then I
just blended it in with a contour sponge
and dwana
I feel bright in light and now I'm going
to bake I'm using the Tarte smooth
operator to bake and this is another
sponge that's dry and I'm applying that
there I'm using this contour palette
this is from California cosmetics it's
actually really it's pretty good um I
was very impressed with the quality the
powder is blend really easy into the
skin and it lasts all day long so I
definitely give this a thumbs up so now
I'm going to wipe off our baking powder
I'm taking the banana powder right here
and just going to highlight my under
eyes a little bit more taking it up
another notch
I know we've highlighted five times but
guys the brighter the better for my face
that's how I feel anyways I don't know
if you guys feel the same way this is
the eyes I love this look it looks great
on anybody's eye color and it's a very
fall appropriate now I'm taking the
tipsy blush from Tarte I just applied it
to the apples of my cheek bones now I'm
going back in with the highlight we used
earlier on our inner corners and just
blush brushing it on the top of my my
cheekbones the tip of my nose and then
blending it out this is the sad girl
liquid lipstick from Anastasia I took a
really long time to make sure this
didn't get on the outside of my lips and
I did over line my lips with this
because it's so okay but yeah take your
time with dark lipsticks especially
liquid lipsticks they do not it's really
hard to remove from your face so take
your time and I'm sure it'll come out
great and this is the look I hope you
