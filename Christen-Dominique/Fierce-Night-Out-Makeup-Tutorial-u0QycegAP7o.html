welcome back to my channel today I'm
having a messy hair kind of day today
I'm going to be showing you how to get
this plummy smokey eye I love it it's so
so pretty it's one of those looks that
you can do for a girls night out or just
a glam kind of makeup look also I want
to thank buxom for partnering up with me
in this video
for these lippies this one that I have
on right now as I can't wait to see you
in it if you do recreate this look make
sure to tag me on instagram hashtag

looks and give it a like and check you
out so if you want to see how to get
this look don't forget to subscribe to
my channel and hit that notification
bell so you could be a part of the quad
family and without further ado yes my
elbow is cold let's get on with the
video my primer and brow so I'm gonna
just jump right in to the foundation I'm
gonna be using the LC micro silk
foundation I haven't used this in a long
time I remember using it a few times
really liking it and then I couldn't
find my shade but I have a ton of
different shades to choose from the only
thing about these foundations is you may
think it's your color on the outside but
then when you put it on your face it's
like 30 shades darker so just be careful
with that but I do like this foundation
it is very full coverage I'm gonna start
off with camp vanilla I'm gonna put it
on the back of my eyelash box you're
gonna notice when you put this on your
face it is extremely thin if you're not
patient enough you're almost gonna feel
like there's no coverage but if you just
let it set into your skin you'll see
that it's a it's a very pigmented
foundation it's just extremely
lightweight there's been a cricket that
has been haunting me this entire time I
don't know if you guys can hear it I'm
pretty sure you can but it's even louder
it's back with a vengeance cuz we
thought it was gone but it is back and
it's super super loud I'll shoot it out
later
I really like that this foundation is
super light like thin and lightweight
but it has a lot of pigment in it so
it's very full coverage the first this
is the first layer I could leave it here
but I mean add just another little bit
of a layer because I like the cake but
it doesn't make it look cakey at all and
it feels very comfortable on the skin
but it does dry down Matt when I use
this I kind of like because it's so flat
this is a very matte foundation because
it's so flat I do like to use some sort
of finishing spray with this and then
I'm gonna move over to the eyes and this
time I'm actually not gonna use
concealer I'm just gonna use this
foundation as my base okay I'm gonna go
ahead and start on the eyes for the eyes
I'm going to use this palette right here
it's the ciate London pretty fun
fearless palette by Chloe Morello it's
really fun pretty packaging and then
when you open it up it has it has a cute
mirror right here with the flamingos on
the sides I'm gonna first pick up
skinny-dip it's a very light topi shade
it reminds me of like just nude skin or
like a nude bikini this is oh it's super
super creamy it almost feels like a
cream but I'm gonna go ahead and pick
that up first work it into the eye the
time Los Angeles 206 brush and picking
up skinny dip okay I'm gonna work this
shade right into the crease so I'm gonna
go right
so I'm just gonna work that into the
crease and then I'm gonna take this
fluffier brush right here from the
makeup Shack is the t68 wash the color
even more into the skin and then I'm
gonna take on fire which is this shade
right here the same brush and start to
work that and I'm gonna have it sit
right below the first shade that we use
I'm gonna take it right around the
crease also kind of through the inner
corner right here it's gonna be a nice
transition for the purple that we're
going to use in just a little bit here
this is the Mac two two 1s brush and I'm
just gonna pop in to flirt which is that
really pretty plum and work that on the
outer edge by the outer V I'm gonna
leave the inner third of the lid length
so that we can pop into one of those
pretty shimmers focus all of the
plumbing shades right on the outer
portion of the eye and then I'm going to
take it out kind of extending it towards
the end of the brow like right where the
brow ends and then taking this big
fluffier brush and just going over the
edges just diffusing them into the skin
the next color minute take is day dream
I'm gonna take it on a pencil brush this
brush doesn't have a number so I'm just
going to take that on the outer corner
and really deepen up the outer V while
these shades
way okay then I'm gonna take this Mac to
a 17s brush and go into my tribe which
is this cream vanilla shade and then I'm
gonna take that right underneath the
brow bone to pop the shape out and also
just make the eyeshadow look a little
bit more clean I'm in for the inner
corners I'm gonna take some concealer
and just put it on the back of my hand
and grab a flat brush like this one
right here from the makeup shucks the
t51 conceal right in the front of the
lid just so that I shadow that we put on
top can really pop and then right on top
of the concealer I'm gonna take happy
this shade right here this is just a
really pretty cool tone gray shimmer
shade let me go back in to flirt and
just marry these colors together so that
they don't look like this is a like a
harsh line right now I'm gonna do the
wing for the lean I have this Maybelline
curva tude liner right here
I'm just gonna pop this mascara on right
here it's called big T's from buxom to
prep our lashes for falsies oh this one
really grabs onto the lashes I'm gonna
pick out some lashes from my little
books that I have here this is a bunch
of different lashes so this is just old
ones that I'd use like once or twice I'm
gonna pick up flirt and pop it onto the
lower lash line take it all the way in
all the way into the inner corners blend
it out and then right with that
waterline is I'm going to take the
Maybelline Gigi Hadid gel liner pop that
in right there then I'm going to take my
concealer from NARS and work that right
into the inner corners
and then for the highlight I'm going to
use the buxom divine goddess Luminizer
in Venus what a name so it's this liquid
illuminator like this and I've tried it
before it's very subtle I'm just going
to take that on the cheeks I'm gonna use
this as a base highlight and take it
right down the nose and I'm right on top
of they keep it's about to bake
underneath my eyes I'm gonna use the
Laura Mercier brightening under-eye
powders oh wait it's called the secret
brightening powder for under eyes that's
a really long name but I'm gonna use
this in shade one and just work it right
on top of my concealer I'm gonna let
that settle and then I'm gonna take the
new bronzer from the balm it's called
take home the bronze it's an anti orange
bronzer this is in the shade tawny
so I'm going to take this and work that
right on the cheeks give to face some
color
and I'm gonna use the Mac to 75s it's
like a curvy brush and I'm gonna take
the bronze Grammy shade this one right
here and snatch my nose real quick I'm
gonna take the vanilla shade from the
latte palette and just go right over the
top of the nose and down the center to
highlight right along the sides of the
nose I like that this isn't too ashy as
a contour color it's not like super
orange that shade that I used as a
bronzer we brought a nice tan into my
face I am loving these bronzers so far
now I'm gonna use the frat-boy
blush right here from the balm just a
light pink flush of color I'm just gonna
use that right on the apples of my
cheeks so I'm gonna go ahead and pop on
a lip color to my lips the one I'm gonna
be using is from buxom it's the Evolve
ah plump shiny liquid lipstick and the
shade that I'm gonna use is a beg for
mob or come to dolly I'm in between both
of them there's actually 20 shades to
choose from that I have they're all
really pretty and go from fall to spring
day to night with them but I'm gonna
choose something with like a pinky
purple undertone something kind of Mavi
it has like a curved lip applicator it's
supposed to really hug your lip and just
be easy to apply it really gets into the
curve of your lip which is a good thing
okay I'm gonna test this one out on the
bottom of my lip because I'm not really
sure about this color and then I'm gonna
text beg for I mean text and then I'm
gonna show you what beg for mob looks
like just you see it oh no that's too
bright
there's also getting warmer let's see
what this looks like
I'm actually gonna change it up I'm
gonna use getting warmer I'm gonna take
all these shades off of my lip ooh and
there's like a plumping effect in this
lip so I can feel like the tingly
sensation happening the shade I'm gonna
use is getting warmer I decided on this
one right here I think it would go
perfect with this lip and with one swipe
you get a really saturated color so it's
a really nice and shiny and it's
supposed to last pretty long this is the
final look I love the way this came out

ponytail thank you guys for watching I
