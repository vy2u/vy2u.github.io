you
is studying behind my back you know when
you don't know if you shaved your
armpits yet he's just like okay that
would be embarrassing if I actually
didn't shave my arm hey guys welcome
back to my channel so today I'm gonna be
doing this natural glowy look I put a
pull-up on Twitter to see if you guys
wanted to see something glam or more
fresh-faced I was very excited when you
guys wanted to see something fresh-faced
because I was already kind of thinking I
wanted that I just wanted to gauge what
you guys wanted to see so I created this
look right here it's very easy it's
super glowy and it's all creams so it
looks like your skin but better so I
really like this look I think I'm gonna
be doing it a lot this year for my no
makeup makeup days I'm everything on my
face is contour colors creams just vary
your skin and your face but better if
you want to learn how to get this look
then keep watching so I'm going to start
off with a bunch of skincare because
skincare is so important for your makeup
to look really nice and clean and smooth
so what I'm going to do is put on this
number 7 early defense day cream and it
has a sunscreen in it I have lipstick on
my hand that could have went really bad
really best and I just wiped it on my
pants Joe that's my life anything any
day cream honestly I don't use this one
all the time I just opened this one up
in I like the ingredients and I like the
way it felt when I put it on my hand it
was very light very light weight feeling
and those are my favorite kind of
moisturizers to use during the day you
don't want anything that's thick on your
skin I saved my thicker creams for
nighttime the next thing that I'm going
to be using is this primer this is from
Urban Decay
it's the optical illusion complexion
primer this one is a smoothing primer so
it's going to make your skin feel really
smooth and velvety and that means that
the foundation that goes on top of it is
going to
lay down very smooth so I'm gonna pop
this on it to my face mmm that's smooth
whoa I like to use smoothing primers
like this because it fills in all of the
large pores and any divots that you have
in your skin it'll help them look a
little bit more smoother and it kind of
plumps them up let's make our skin look
flawless I'm going to use this Smashbox
Studios skin 15 hour we're hydrating
primer the key to everything that I'm
using today is hydrating because it is
winter time and my skin gets very dry
during the winter my head gets really
flaky it's really bad so I like to go
for every and anything that says
hydrating on it because I need a lot of
help in that department so this is a
hydrating foundation and it's also it
has a really nice coverage and it
doesn't feel thick on your skin it's a
very lightweight very wearable for
daytime or every day so I'm going to
apply this with a brush this one is very
buildable too so if you want a light
coverage it's not immediate full
coverage it's buildable so if you want
something that's a little bit more on
the light side or if you don't need as
much coverage this is also a good
foundation to use for that put a little
bit here and I'm not going for a full
coverage of foundation when I'm doing
something that's everyday I do really
like full coverage foundation love full
coverage foundation it is my everything
but for something like everyday and I
just want to look like my natural self
but better I don't I don't need full
coverage for that so now my skin's even
I'm gonna go in with some concealer and
fill in those under-eye circles so I'm
going to go ahead and put on a very
lightweight concealer this is the NARS
radiant creamy concealer
drag it out like this I'm going to go
ahead and start my eyebrows because I
need some eyebrows today he's the COO
brow this is a number five and this is
actually waterproof and 24 hour long
wearing everybody needs that in their
life so I'm going to fill in my brows
and start at the bottom of my brow and
just follow the natural curve we got how
much brow I need so I want it to look
very natural and full I want my brow to
look like a natural full brow now I'm
using the brow precise to my brow pencil
in number six from benefit and I'm going
to use that to fill in the sparse areas
all right so now I'm ready for the eye
shadow I'm going to be using the Tarte
man-eater palette on the go palette
which is perfect for something that is
everyday or very natural looking so the
first thing I'm going to do is pop into
this color right here this is passion
it's like a matte nudie peachy looking
shade it's going to be taking this guy
right here and I'm going to be placing
him all over the lid all the way up into
the brow bone so what I'm doing right
here is just mattifying everything and
sealing my creams in place so I'm going
to take this color right here which is
her to Matt Mabi shade I'm going to take
that with my Sigma blending b25 brush
I'm going to work that onto the crease
and I'm just going to follow the natural
hollow of my crease I'm just going to
diffuse the edges so they're not so
harsh so it's very natural and fresh
looking I'm going to take saucy which is
the color next to it and this is also a
matte shade with the same brush I'm just
going to enhance the crease and I'm
going right below that shade to add
extra definition to the crease I'm going
to take passion and
with a more densely packed brush and
start to work that on my I really
enhancing the lid and then for the brow
bone I'm going to take me out which is
the lightest color in the palette right
here and I'm going to need a closed
mirror for this because I can't see I
just pop it on to the brow bone
literally Pat it down so you can get the
most out of the color I always like my
right under my brow to look the lightest
makes the eyebrows down doubt makes the
eyeshadow stand out a little more as you
can see the difference and then I'm
going to take this shade right here it's
called lace and I'm going to pop it into
the inner corners to add some light
there bring it down a little bit right
below the tear duct okay so the next
thing I'm going to do is put on some
mascara super basic and I'm going to be
using this mascara from Maybelline it's
their new mascara the colossal Big Shot
and I really really like this mascara I
used to use it back in the days like
high school days and now they came out
with this one I think I'm using it again
because it is so good it just separates
and lists every single lash so nicely so
I'm going to put some of that I'm gonna
put a lot of that on actually wow I'm so
impressed with this mascara it is so
bomb look at that and then I'm going to
pop on some lashes so I'm going to put
these on and I will be right back okay
now I'm going to do some cream
contouring I'm going to use this Kiko
palette and take my Sigma angled cream
contour brush I have a discount code in
case you guys wondering I have it bound
below so you guys can check it out I'm
just going to dip into this brush and
start to contour my cheekbones and my
nose bring it up it's just a natural
shadow that you're enhancing right
underneath the cheekbone my face is a
little bit more rounded so I liked a
definition to it I want to look natural
but I want to look defined to my
features to look really nice and define
so contouring is a must for me and I'm
also going to go down my nose with it I
like the ends to curve out and then
these two little lines on
side like that and that's what is
basically what I do to contour and then
I'm just going to blend out the edges so
it looks nice and defined you go into
strobing side I'm going to take my
morphe y 15 brush just work that in
there and then start to apply that onto
my cheekbones
all right on the Cupid's bow and I'm
also gonna do it right on the chin you
don't have to do this especially if you
have oily skin I have skin that's more
on the drier side so you can skip this
part if you want to add some color to my
face I'm going to add some blush this is
the color pop a pop flushed blush I like
it because it's creamy it's like on the
cleany side so it'll work really well
where the look that we're going for
today so I'm just going to pop it onto
my cheekbones with my finger and just
press it into my skin and then with my
clean finger I'm dabbing around it so
there's no harsh edges my Chaka what did
you mean you didn't make this you did no
thank you so I'm going to set my face
with this powder right here this is the
cover FX translucent setting powder
perfect setting powder but is this just
to set everything in place I'm not I'm
gonna avoid the parts where I
highlighted just so that they can still
shine through so I'm going to take this
brush right here since from BH Cosmetics
C 136 brush so I'm just gonna go right
underneath here and it's not giving us
any coverage it's just literally setting
everything in place so doesn't move
around right around there and then I'm
going to put it right underneath the
under eyes but I'm not going to drag it
out too far because I still want the
highlight to really be pop in I'm I use
this bronzer right here this is from the
bomb it's called bomb beach the long
wearing blush but it's like a bronzer
it's called warm it up it's gonna go
along the outer perimeter my face I've
been obsessed with these lip liners from
Make Up For Ever these high precision
lip pencils so I'm going to use a number
13 to line my lips and then I'm going to
put a gloss over something really
natural-looking
I just want my lips to have a nice full
definition so I'm going to line them up
first I feel like this is a very natural
looking color for me and then I'm going
to use this Marc Jacobs
cream in fawn over me I actually just
got these in from my PR packages so it's
very new and I wanted to try it out for
you guys
and just kind of pop it on to my lips I
thought it would be shiny but it's not
it's actually totally different from
what I was thinking but it's a very
pretty color I thought it's going to be
a little bit more glossy and actually do
want a little bit of gloss on my lips so
I'm going to look for a gloss and then
I'll be right back I'm gonna go right on
top with this luxe lacquer from BH
Cosmetics and this is in the shade
Columbian coffee actually a perfect
match for the color we just put on our
lips Wow what I put on right now should
be a lip kit
