without further ado let's get on with
the video I already did my brows
off-camera so if you guys wanna check
out how I filled them in all my do's and
don'ts and tips and tricks go ahead and
check out this link right here I just
filmed a whole video on it just for the
brows so go ahead and check that out if
you're interested and let's get on with
the rest of the face so I'm gonna start
off with primer I'm gonna use this one
here from Stila it's the one-step
corrector gentle caressing and a
brightening primer since we're doing
more of a fresh face kind of look you
want to make sure that your skin looks
so good bomb perfect so I'm going to mix
I'm gonna take this primer to help with
all of those issues on my face i
exfoliated my skin moisturised so our
foundation is going to sit on our face
really nice and smooth we just gotta be
careful around the brow area
and because this primer has the purple
the green and that orange undertone it's
gonna help cancel out any red spots any
dull areas on your face and it's also
going to help with those dark areas
under your eyes actually gonna go in a
little bit further with this right
underneath the eye area I haven't used a
steal a primer in a long time
it's nice to go back to something that I
really used to love so that helped to
brighten up my eyes so much we are back
to life now I'm going to fill in any
large pores so we can look like the
pretty filter this one is from cover
effects it's called the blurring primer
it's out like this and it's pretty thick
so I like to just Pat it in to those
areas where I feel like my pores are
just wide open I'm just gonna put it in
right here
I just also want to let you guys know
that this is mattifying so if you have
any oily spots on your face or if you're
oily in the t-zone this is gonna help
you out with that and for some reason I
have been getting oily today I'm gonna
be using a new foundation so excited to
try it this is the Laura Mercier
flawless fusion foundation and it's
supposed to be medium to full coverage
which is great for me I want my skin to
look good since I don't have a lot of
makeup on my eyes to distract from zits
pimples redness so I'm gonna take this
one I this is in golden I also have dune
so I'm gonna go in between the both of
them I feel like I'm right in the middle
and start to work that on my face and if
it's a little too golden actually I
think I can work this into the rest of
my body to have a fake tan going on and
I think it's gonna work out for us I'm
just gonna Pat this in so I can get nice
full coverage while this foundation
feels very light on the skin and it
covers a lot of redness ooh I like a
light I'm gonna let that sit for a few
seconds and then go in with a second
layer because I want a flawless flawless
no blemishes at all kind of skin today
it doesn't feel like a heavy foundation
but it does have a lot of pigment in it
so it really covers a lot without
feeling like it's super thick and heavy
this is a really good foundation it's a
new one for me so I'm excited about it
it's you know what it's almost as good
as the Estee Lauder Double Wear without
it feeling drying this is not drying
something is in this foundation I'm
gonna go in with concealer right now
just because I want to I want to look at
these panda eyes anymore you're gonna go
in with the Tarte shape tape and medium
buy a little inner corner triangle you
know what I'm not gonna even do the
highlight thing I think it's gonna look
a little too much but I am gonna go in
with my new micro B blender I really
love these for the under eyes I'm gonna
go ahead and top that in out to the tops
of the cheekbones I'm gonna get this
whole triangle right here it's gonna
lift your eye make it look brighter and
then after it's set into the skin then I
take this side just go along the edges
to make sure we don't have any harsh
edges anywhere so what I have left on
the beauty blender i go ahead and i Pat
onto the eyelid just so that we can use
this as a base for our eyes shadow we
aren't doing much with eye shadow but we
are going to accentuate our natural eye
shape and really enhance the shape of
our eyes so I do want some type of
tackiness there and I do want it to look
nice and even I want to even base before
I go in with any with any color cuz if I
just go in its gonna look patchy and
uneven I'm gonna go in with this Tarte
setting powder it's called filtered
light and a Beauty Blender which is kind
of damp but he's okay and then I'm going
to look up and work that underneath my
eyes so I don't have any creasing even
though this smells good it smells like a
vanilla cake this feels really tight all
of the sudden try it right below for my
eyes I'm gonna be using the one the only
Sokol Concilio violet Voss palette I've
been using it everyday first of all can
we talk about the amount of different
shades of orange and burnt Browns
there are in here this is a definite
everyday kind of palette I love it
Nicole this is amazing I'm gonna go in
with and the names are so freakin cute
I'm going to set my entire lid with and
easy and for that I'm gonna take my time
2:05 brush these brushes are so gorgeous
they match with my background I kind of
want to put them back there I'm very
tempted I'm gonna work that all over my
eyelid so we can set all those creams in
place very nice pigmentation its glides
all over the lid just smooth like butter
loving that I'm gonna go in with hangry
which is me all the time and I'm gonna
work that all in my crease this is very
warm
I want to tone it down a little bit use
a fluffier brush for this area so I'm
going to take this brush biloxi 2:29 and
I go into hangry and boop bop and I just
want to wash that all over the crease I
want it to be really nice and soft so
you don't want to get too much product
on there and these are pretty pigmented
oh I'm going back and forth like this
and once your wiper motions on the areas
where you feel like it's a little harsh
all you have to do is lift your brush up
as light as you can barely put any
pressure onto your skin and just go back
and forth in these circular motions and
it will erase that harsh line everything
will transition super super nice into
one another so you just got to use a
very light hand when you do this moving
literally a wash of color I'm getting
this huge fluffy brush from dose of
colors this is called a blending it's
just called blending I'm gonna go over
the entire thing with this with a very
light hand and just go back and forth
deepen up the crease a little bit
further chocolate chopped I can't I
can't do a New York accent Nicole with
chocolate I'm gonna use this tiny little
brushes from morphe it's the M 507 work
a tiny amount right in here
you can already see like the natural
shadow right there so add a little bit
of extra definition to that area on the
outer portion like I tried just because
you have a fresh face doesn't mean that
you can't put eyeshadow on and you still
can enhance the natural contour of your
eye and make that look really really
beautiful like you are and then at the
same time I'm going back in with my
bigger blending brush just so we can
soften everything out but we still want
to make sure we can see that definition
out there we just don't need it to be
like a harsh line that is Boba's cat
here I have it in my nose actually and
then for the lid I'm gonna go in with
bra for the brow bone I'm Zozo right
here look at that butter so pretty I'm
gonna use that on the brow bone kinda
spread it out with my finger so that it
isn't overwhelming when I turn my head
you'll see that nice pop of highlight
I'm gonna take chocolate work that on
the outer part of the lash line just to
give it a little bit of a lift and then
I'm gonna lift up the brush and just
softly work that I shadow out towards
the brow go in with Henry and boop-boop
again and work that on the outer part of
the lower lash line this is the dose of
color shader brush and it just works so
perfect underneath the lash line with
that same brush take a tiny bit on the
lower lash line just add a tiny
definition right at the outer edge the
new mascara from the balm is called
scuba it's water-resistant works really
good for this summer time when you go
work out and you want a little bit of
something on your lashes take her
swimming on the first date obviously you
guys you don't have to do this step if
you don't feel comfortable on a fresh
face kind of day this is my take on a
fresh face makeup look I like to put
lashes on I think it makes a world of a
difference on your face brings your
whole look together and makes me feel
really girly and pretty so I love
wearing lashes with anything that I do
so you definitely can skip this but
definitely get yourself some early
lashes the lux ones are really nice
alright so we're done with the lashes
and now I'm going to move on to the rest
of the face for the contour I'm going to
use the new pur cosmetics contour
Diaries such cute packaging the marble
loving it the rose gold it's so pretty
go into passion and I'm gonna work that
into the hollow areas of my face so we
can load snatch like an alien the more
morphe m57 to and I'm just gonna work
that into the hollow of my cheek bone
and stop right about here just so can
look very natural and then I'm gonna
work the product
I'm going to use this to bronze my face
but I don't have anything on it so I'm
just gonna work it on the cheekbone well
I can blend the contour into the skin so
it looks nice and soft and then I'm
gonna just go right on the end of the
nose just to make it look more rounded
and that's the only places I'm really
gonna contour now I'm just gonna bronze
my face for that I'm using the LC light
all over just taking that on my temples
so now I'm just gonna brighten so for
that I'm gonna take a charm and dream
this yellow color oh I love yellow
powders I think they work so well with
medium skin tones and they just brighten
up make you look gorgeous
so I'm gonna go right under the eyes up
that in doing this kind of helps narrow
the nose out as well so kind of pushes
it together now that my face is nice and
bright I'm gonna put some fix+ on just
so I can melt all the powders together
into the skin and make it like skin
again just so that we don't have any
cakey areas on our face to bring more of
that fresh blush of color to your face
I'm going to take blisful from Tarte
we're gonna load it up and we're gonna
Pat it on to the skin instead of
sweeping it back and forth because then
you're gonna get way too much on your
skin and it's hard to go back so a
little bit at a time is the secret to
get a really nice makeup so now it's
time to highlight the face I'm gonna
take the cover of fact celestial dropped
so you can actually work it on to a
powder and it won't get weird so I'm
just gonna put that right up here and
right on my highlight mustache and maybe
some of my real mustache and you can
actually stop there but if you really
love that intense glow then I would keep
going take the Kylie a face duo and
skinny dip wrap this shade right here
glow up
so now that we're glowing to the gods
I'm going to go ahead and pop on a lippy
which is very very simple take this Marc
Jacobs lipgloss in pretty thing and I
love the applicator on this thing
because it picks up color from both
sides so you can easily apply it to your
lip and that's it thank you guys for
