actually wear a dewy skin and make it
look good
I've always had like issues with
blemishes and crater II areas you can
see it on camera it just looks so pretty
and glowing I love it so today I'm going
to show you how to get fresh glowing
skin and beautiful glowing eyes let's
get started so to get that radiant
youthful glow and going for the first
thing I'm using is the Pacifica ultra CC
cream I'm in the color natural medium
and I like the way it feels on my skin
it's a lightweight and it has like a
subtle Jasmine fragrance so it smells
really nice too I'm just going to evenly
apply this to my face to give me an
instant illuminating appearance I
noticed that the CC cream blends into my
skin really easy and after I applied it
I notice how hydrated my skin was so it
doesn't even feel like a foundation it
feels more like a moisturizer which is
always really nice
to highlight my cheekbones and brighten
up my undereyes I'm using the dream lit
under eye brightener in the color dream
light and I'm just going to take the
wand and smooth it over my under eyes
forming a V so that it also acts as a
highlight to my cheekbones as well as
coverage to my dark circles and I'm
going to be using a clean finger to
lightly Pat this into my skin the warmth
of my fingers is going to help the
makeup go on smoothly
now it's time to set our makeup in place
and I also want a bit more coverage so
I'm going to use the perfect Lotus
universal powder in natural if you want
more of a full coverage the powder is
buildable so you can definitely achieve
it but I'm going to keep it pretty light
today even though this is a brightening
powder I like how it doesn't make your
skin look shimmery or glittery it just
gives you an all-over natural glowing
dewy look
now for the eyes I'm going to use this
reddish-brown bronzer to wash over the
crease and also the lower lash line and
this is going to help with our glowing
eyes effect
to give our eyes dimension I'm going to
use this light golden brown color
for the lower crease for the lids I'm
mixing the gold and peach color together
and then I'm packing this on with a
shadow brush
to brighten up this look even more I'm
taking this iridescent opal color and
applying it to the inner corners
to add soft definition to the look and
taking a gray eye pencil in lining the
outer half of the waterline
next I'm going to prep my lashes by
curling them and then I'm going to apply
some mascara to give our lashes fullness
and length
to add warmth to our face I'm going to
apply a bronzer to my cheekbones and
around my temples
to hydrate my lips and add a light peach
color I'm using this balm here and then
I'm going to highlight the center of my
lips with this neutral golden color
and this is the final look let me know
