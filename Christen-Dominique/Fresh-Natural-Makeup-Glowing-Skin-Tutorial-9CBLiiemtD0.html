super duper glowy for the spring/summer
time since great for like a beach day or
just like in every day everything is
glowing right now and I am living for it
I love it so much I can't wait to show
you how to get this very natural glowy
dewy kind of look I am using some really
fun stuff today
it's I'm very excited about this one
right here I'm using the Fenty beauty
body lava all over the body Otte
so I'm going to show you how to get this
super glowy kind of look and a very
contoured structured face full brows is
very natural but beautiful so I am so
excited to show you so let's go ahead
and get right into this video but before
we jump in don't forget to subscribe to
my channel and hit that notification bow
so you can be a part of the quad family
and without further ado let's get in to
the video we're gonna prep the skin so I
want to show you guys what I use cuz I
this is kind of like my current Holy
Grail to prime my face before makeup and
I just love the way my makeup sits on my
face
after doing this step so I really want
to show you guys I used the Far Sally
volcanic elixir drops put that in my
hand and then I press it into my skin
you guys like my blue nails I have been
keeping my nails pretty natural just
trying to get them healthy again and
it's actually working my nails are
pretty strong now and I've been taking
these vitamins and it's really been
helping my nails and stuff so very very
happy that my nails are finally getting
back to their natural state I love this
color right here I haven't painted right
now since so long
another thing I also do is the Ola
Henriksen banana bright eye cream right
underneath the eyes I feel like this
kind of helps brighten the eyes before I
apply the make
so and it also hydrates that area really
really good under the eye just anywhere
I would apply concealer really I like to
put this on so I just Pat it into the
skin like so I have I look like Rudolph
the red-nosed reindeer right now I woke
up with this weird pink dot on my nose I
don't know how I don't know why I kind
of really really really really want to
try this venti beauty body lava first so
I'm gonna put this on right now but can
we talk about how beautiful this is how
heavy this bottle is it's very very luxe
and not gonna lie I've sort of pricey
but if you are going to buy something
that looks like this and let's see how
it applies then it might be worth it so
the packaging is beautiful love the rose
gold this is the shade who needs clothes
I mean really who needs clothes actually
I do I have a little scarf on that I'm
pretending is a shirt and put this all
over my body I want to get that super
glowy summer look so let's try this out
oh I also have the powder puff so I'm
gonna put that on afterwards I feel like
it'll really stick on to the skin better
so it comes with this little brush this
little kind of kabuki brush for the body
and face I'm gonna just put it on the
brush first so coming out it looks like
this oh my god how pretty is that mmm
but that looks really nice it's just
kind of blended into my skin so easy
okay it is very very glowy very shimmery
so I'm gonna put more on it almost looks
like a gel coming out but it it really
melts into the skin I'm gonna put it on
my decollete or however you say and on
my shoulders inspired by Rihanna that
shoulder glow this is such a beautiful
package I love rose gold rose gold is
just so pretty and just luxe and look at
this big huge powder puff look how big
this is it's so cute I kind of want to
just put this on display we're gonna
innocence venti beauty right here so
cute let's open this thing up it's kind
of looks like Boba's face doesn't it
it's just like super fluffy
in round this is Bobo space like this
her face would literally be like this
but like half but we're gonna go ahead
and pop it on her body it's very light
actually but if you want to go for you
know something more subtle I'm like
beating my shoulder to death but do you
see the glow it's very subtle it's
really nice I like the I like the body
lava and the puff together and kind of
like mellows it out a little bit we are
glowy on the body I got a lot of stuff
that makes you super glowy for the
spring summer so I was really inspired
just to do something fresh natural and
glowing and I want my skin just to look
really healthy and supple so I'm gonna
start with the skin first because the
eyes are like very minimal in this in
today's tutorial and I'm gonna go in now
with some of the CC cream from herb or
Ian this is the color Claire I think
that's how you say it it's basically
like clear and it's this is for lighter
skin tones I feel like the dark that I
normally use when I'm fake tanning looks
good but when I get back to my natural
color it looks a little orange II around
the neck like you can see the line so
I'm gonna try this one right here
because first of all I love the CC cream
it is my all-time most favorite CC cream
it makes my texture kind of disappear
which is kind of like magic because it's
really difficult to make texture
disappear and this guy does it just
evens out your skin tone and it looks
like your skin but like 20 times better
so it comes out like this it's white
when you work it in I'm gonna working in
with me my fingertips I'm gonna do on
both sides when you start to work it in
it's supposed to adjust to your skin
tone so I'm trying the light shade
because let me see how light this is I
haven't I've missed my first time
putting on this color but you can see
how soft it makes you my skin look
already it just barely put it on it you
can tell how soft and it makes it it
kind of gives it this like dewy healthy
glowy look which is perfect for like
this type of spring/summer kind of
healthy skin look put some on the
forehead and I like tap it in I'm really
loving my nails by the way I don't know
why I keep bringing up my nails but it's
just very distracting the color
it's just so pretty I'm gonna go ahead
and put that right underneath my
under-eye circles as well it kind of
evens out my under eyes very softly and
subtly but you can tell the difference
and it's just honestly like putting on a
moisturizer I'm gonna put some down here
too because you still want to work it
into your neck because it does give you
some type of color I am all about this
easy cream and I really am NOT a CC
cream BB cream kind of girl I just I'd
rather not but when I met this guy right
here I fell in love now we have a
relationship and it's official I am in
love with this CC cream after this I'm
gonna put concealer on cover those dark
under eye circles and like the darker
areas of my face so I'm going to use the
k'kaw concealer in shade 6 if you're
more my skin tone honestly I'm trying
out shade 6 for like the second time and
I do feel like it's good at neutralizing
but I feel like if you want to brighten
you probably want to use shade 5 4 or 5
my skin looks very even but I want some
brightness so I'm gonna take shade for
and just put a little bit right in here
I don't want to bring it out too far
from you ready put on some concealer
they just want to brighten up like the
highlight high points of my face this
concealer is so so nice I've been using
it ever since I got it it just hides
your under-eye circles so beautifully
and it's it's not drying under the eye
I've been using it a lot and you know
how I am about my concealers and my dark
circles those of you that have been
following me for a while
I am very like my under-eye circles are
the reason why I started putting on
makeup in the first place Soho concealer
is like a big deal to me
because we're going more natural on the
skin we want the skin to look as natural
and beautiful as possible so I wanted to
use a cream so I'm going to take my
honest as you have cream contour palette
and this isn't the the light shade
somebody use this middle contour color
and I'm going to take this Mac 1 9 7 s
brush and start to chisel out the
cheekbones and I'm just gonna make the
lines and then I'll
everything in when your brush is way too
big for your nose contour this is what
happens I'm gonna brush it upwards to
blend it into the skin and then I'm
gonna go over it with a Beauty Blender
because I just think that's the most
natural way to get work it into the skin
you want to press that contour into your
skin so don't don't move it around like
just you want to push it into your skin
so Pat it dab it whatever you want to
call it just press it in there so I'm
gonna do the bronzing on the skin now
I'm gonna use the Too Faced bronzed
peach but it's basically a cream and it
just turns into a powder so I'm gonna
use this with my finger actually and
just put it on my cheekbones bring it up
into oh I just got this new highlights
like a liquid highlight from la splash
so I wanted to try it out what's called
radiate it's a really cute little bottle
and it's their hydro a liquid highlight
so I'm gonna take some of this and it
looks like soon
like two dots right there and I'm
actually not gonna put this on my nose
because I don't want to have like that
type of highlight today's wow it's
really not blending out that easy and
it's making me a little nervous
shoot Oh No finally it blend it out but
I think that you just need to do as
quick as possible but it's kind of
taking off some of my concealer which is
a little annoying so I don't know how I
feel about this guy I thought it was
gonna go a lot smoother than that but
it's fine because we still have a powder
highlight that we can put on top so I'm
now I'm just gonna make sure that my
under eyes are nice in bright so I'm
going to use the k'kaw brightening
powder this yellow one let me take my
sponge I'm gonna mix in between number
two and number three
whoa this is super brightening I haven't
used a Beauty Blender with this powder
before and I really like it I'm gonna
take some of this laura geller
gilded honey baked highlight and then
work that on the cheekbones highlight on
my ears
my ears can slay - okay so now we're
moving in to the eyes which is totally
backwards for me normally but I like the
fact that my skin looks good already so
we're very close to the end point of the
look so I'm going to use the new the
repackaged natural matte from Too Faced
palette I really like this packaging
it's very pretty
very soft and romantic looking so I'm
gonna take all natural right here and a
little bit of less is more so I'm going
to dig I'm gonna take my brush into
those two shades and I'm just gonna take
that in the crease I'm gonna make a
little V out here with the shadows so
that's pretty much all we're gonna do
for the crease and then with a flat
brush taking those two shades again and
just sweeping it underneath the lash
line to give it some dimension bring
back some dimension because we lost a
lot of it with the brightening and then
for the lid I'm just gonna use lace
Teddy and you can even use your finger
I'm just gonna use my finger because
this is how easy it is you don't even
need a brush and then with heaven which
is the lighter shade in the palette I'm
gonna highlight my brow bone for the
center of the lid Le splash also came
out with this really pretty liquid
shadow it looks like a bunch of glitter
and shimmer mixed together so it looks
really pretty to me and I wanted to try
it in this video hopefully it works out
better than what the cheek did so it's
basically like a champagne color with
gold flecks in it work it in with my
finger and then take the ek candy coin
glitter it's just a little glitter pot
and Pat that on the center of the eyelid
oh that's pretty
yeah two little strips of glitter going
down my eyes it's different I like it
I'm also gonna put it on the inner
corners because I feel like that's
missing so I'm gonna do the same thing
that I did on the lid to the inner
corners okay right in there I'm gonna
pick up some of the same glitter and
just put it on top of that liquid
eyeshadow okay so for the lid I kind of
want to use this cream
from dose of colors we're gonna use the
gel liner I'm just gonna take this L
thirteen LC brush to work it on there I
just want a little bit of a lift on the
outer corners so and this is the shade
weekender so it's kind of like a like a
rustic almost maroon shade so lashes I'm
going to use today are from Lily lashes
either style goddess right here they're
so like soft and feathery and just
really pretty they just give you that
flirty kind of look and they're perfect
for like natural looks like this okay so
the eyes are done oh actually I I need
you my brows at some point in my life so
I'm gonna take my benefit brow powder in
number five and this brush right here
from LC and I'm just gonna fill in my
brows really quick and I might not even
show you guys this part because it's so
like it's so repetitive so I might just
skim right through this part alright so
we have our brows on I went for a big
full thick brows today now I'm just
gonna do some of this cheek this is like
more of a it's called a watercolor cheek
from spiel it's the rosewater you can
use it on your lips too but I'm gonna
use it on my cheeks and actually have
this new Beauty Blender that is
especially for your cheeks so you see
it's like a medium size I'm gonna take a
little bit of that on my Beauty Blender
and just put that on the cheek hopefully
doesn't stain I'm just hoping it blends
it seems to be blending pretty good like
melts into the skin so that's a good
thing I'm just putting on a little bit
of that for a full tiny bit of a flush
right in the cheek area and that's
pretty much it for the rest of the face
now I'm just gonna put on a lip this new
Kylie lip that came in is so pretty it's
called bear and I have the lip cape I'm
gonna take the lip liner and I like to
use her lip liners all over my lip
they're just so creamy so that is the
lip liner and then I'm gonna go over
with the velvet liquid lipsticks right
on top and then right over this I'm
gonna take her sister cake Kim's k'kaw
super nude lip gloss I'm gonna take the
Smashbox photo-finish centering citrus
primer water this is the collab with
Nicole Concilio super cute bottle i abso
love this and so I'm about to spray this
all over my face and body and just live
it up I love that scent like I can spray
