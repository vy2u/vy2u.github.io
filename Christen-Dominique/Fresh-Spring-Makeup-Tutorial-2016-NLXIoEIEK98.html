my hair is parted in a newt are you done
scratching your back Thanks
so today hey guys welcome back to my
channel so today I filmed this makeup
tutorial for you guys originally it
started out as a very natural
minimalistic makeup look and then I
found some really beautiful spring
colors and I decided to use them in this
video I used purples and it looks really
pretty and wearable you can literally
wear this every day if you wanted to
because it's so natural everything on my
eyes is just a shadow so it's all about
the lashes the lips in the skin the skin
is very highlighted and just flawless
and pretty so when I think of spring I
think of light pastel shades of color so
that's what I want to incorporate in
today's look I hope you guys enjoy this
video if you want to learn how to get
this spring look then keep watching this
so I'm going to use the least wadi a
base correcting this is basically base
for my highlight so when you put your
foundation on top of it it's gonna show
through the foundation which is nice
it's already doing the work for you add
it in with my finger I like to kind of
put it a little bit on top of the
darkness under my sundry circle not all
the way in but just a little bit kind of
helps writing that too okay so you know
I've been loving the ex1 foundation I've
been using it pretty much every day so
I'm going to use this one because I know
that coverage is amazing so I'm going to
go ahead and take a little bit on my
hand my Beauty Blender in there and just
work it in it's good to put the
foundation around on top of your ear and
well that's kind of like an awkward
place to put your foundation just so
everything looks nice and even I'm also
going to have white ears and a dark face
and a dark body a little tip for you
guys also right around the neck area
moving on to the concealer this is the
tarte maracuja creaseless concealer de
stat the coverage was absolutely full
coverage and it's a little bit thick and
sticky feeling but I personally like it
because I feel like it's really doing
the job so I'm going to put it on my
under eyes put it right below the under
eye and then work it all the way to the
top of the cheekbone and then also don't
forget this inner corner usually this is
a darkest part of everyone's a circles
and under eyes now I'm gonna move on to
my eye shadow where the eye shadow I'm
gonna put on a base this is the NARS
base right here so if you're new to
makeup priming your eyes basically
creates an even canvas for your eye
shadow the same time it's supposed to
make it last longer look more vibrant
you don't have this again I always say
this you can just use concealer same
thing now that I have my eyes even I'm
gonna go ahead and start with my eye
shadow the eye shadow I'm going to use
today are these shades right here and I
want to have a very light natural spring
fresh look on my eyes so I'm going to go
in with petal pusher which is this matte
shade right here and it has a purple
undertone like a pinky purple undertone
and I'm taking my 224 Luxy defined
crease brush and work that into my
crease okay let me explain something
about my creases this crease works out
this one does Pilates this one just sits
on the couch and it's potato chips all
day because she's a gown so far but this
one is like a really nice crease shape
so you just follow your crease shape if
you want to change it you can I'm going
to show you how to do that but if not
just follow your natural crease I love
this crease give this crease a thumbs up
this is going to give the look a subtle
depth so I'm going to get started on the
other eye so I'm going to start my brush
right there I'm going to start in short
circular motions head and create a
higher crease I'm just going to place my
brush in a higher spot it's really that
easy and bring it into the inner part of
the eye they don't want you to have a
matching crease and it matches a little
bit better with the other guy after the
lid I'm going to go into confection I'm
going to work it onto the lid like that
just patting it in really
nice lilac purple also if you have like
a hooded soggy lid it helps to kind of
tilt your head back a little bit then
you can better see where you're placing
your shadows I always have a clean
blending brush on hand so that I can
blend any harsh edges out like this one
right here and take it onto the lid and
just blending out the edge I'm going to
work this beautiful Jade right here I'm
very very light this is called whimsical
it's a foiled shadow so I'm going to
take my Mac 242 press my brush into the
shade and then I'm going to pop it on to
the lid like so apply it right up to the
socket so I'm gonna go back into petal
pusher so we're going to go back into
this and just take a little bit more
into the crease working it more so on
the outer pin setting a little bit more
depth here I'm going to take a darker
shade of purple this guy right here and
line the outer part of the lid
this is a new mascara from to phase this
is the better than sex
waterproof mascara and can we just talk
about how cute the packaging looks
there's literally little raindrops all
over the bottle I think it's adorable so
I'm going to go ahead and work this onto
my lashes like so follow bebop okay so I
just applied some lash glue on my lashes
I'm going to quickly pop them onto the
top of my eyelid on my lash line I
wouldn't suggest you pop them onto your
eyelid so you want to go as close as you
can to the lash line I'm just going to
let it sit there and I had my other
eyelash over here drying I had some
eyelash glue on it already so the only
thing that I'm missing is the highlight
on the inner corners and for the
highlight I'm gonna take this shade
which is sorbet it's like a very light
matte pink you have a lot of shimmer
going on on the lid so I'm going to keep
it in that for the inner corner
highlight to add a little bit of flush
of color to my cheeks I'm going to take
dandelion Dew this is a liquid blush
from benefit I'm just going to apply
that with my finger for the highlight
I'm taking some of the Watts
up and I'm just going to apply it to my
the top of my cheekbone and the other
side of the cheekbone
now I'm just going to set my liquids
with some translucent powder and I have
my little contour sponge to do that I'm
just taking a little bit of the powder
and setting it right underneath my eyes
and then for my bronzer and highlight
I'm going to take the Charlotte Tilbury
film-star bronze &amp;amp; Glow and work that
onto the cheekbone and then for the
highlight I'm going to just use this
brush right here this is a tapered
highlighter brush from Sigma B f-35 and
it fits perfectly where you need to put
the highlight so this is a good one I'm
going to go ahead and line my lips this
is the Oprah lip liner in wine I'm going
to take that
and then for the lips I'm going to take
the Too Faced matte lipstick and sorry
not sorry it's like a nude peach and I'm
just going to apply that I also want to
try this one out this is PCH from Velvet
59 has more the pinky tone to it so I'm
just going to lay it right on top yeah
that looks a little bit better so I'm
going to do this one on top so I'm going
to use this lip gloss this is TNT
cosmetics and this is in starlight to
apply it to this Center like where the
