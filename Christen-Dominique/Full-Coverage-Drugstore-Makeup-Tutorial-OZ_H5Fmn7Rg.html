today I am going to be filming this look
right here
I created this using everything that was
new at the drugstore literally today I
went to the drugstore and bought a bunch
of new makeup have my CVS bag right here
and I just went in I just went and
bought everything that was new and this
is what I created with it I really like
it I was shook on some of the products
that were really really good and let me
just tell you right now there's just so
many things in here that I was really
excited about that really works some
things don't work as well as others but
if you want to learn how to get this
look keep watching and don't forget to
subscribe to my channel and hit the
notification bell so you can be updated
as soon as the video comes out me and my
notification quad quad just for Haitian
squad we are very tight I'm not that
cool so without further ado let's get on
with the tutorial I've already primed my
face I'm gonna jump into the foundation
I saw this foundation floating around on
YouTube and I also walked into CVS today
and I saw that this was like one of the
main new things that they had so I was
like ok you know I have to try it you
know I love my full coverage foundation
I'm a full coverage girl so I picked
this one up especially because it says
24 hours really but does it really work
though this is in the color Sunday JH
308 and even though the bottle looks
really dark it's not really that dark
all the tubes look really really dark
and it's so funny this actually looks
like a concealer like a oversized
concealer when it comes out it looks
kind of like a whipped foundation almost
oh it feels very thick honestly thick
and creamy let's put this on the face
I'm gonna put what I have my fingers on
my face oh yeah this is gonna be full
coverage I can already feel it I'm just
going to do it with my finger
old-fashioned way look at that
what in the world
that is a really nice full coverage I
wrap it around my eyelid so we can cover
that redness up and you see the
difference though it doesn't feel like a
lot of makeup though like when I feel it
with my finger it feels like it's pretty
thick and heavy but when I put it on and
blend it in it doesn't feel like
anything you guys my skin is so so so
dry right now
every hydration that I have that I own
face cream under-eye cream neck cream
night cream during the day it's a little
insane
because my skin is super dry right now
it's ridiculous I definitely have to say
that I love the coverage of this and I
like that it has like that airy whipped
feel to it
okay I would definitely repurchase this
this is a good one you guys I got a
request from my last video a subscriber
for my last video had said to please do
my brows on camera and I promised her
that I would do them on camera so I'm
gonna stick to that promise and I'm
going to use the NYX micro brow pencil
in the shade espresso and we are gonna
do our brows on carefully this is a
really big mirror yes elf look how huge
that mirror is so what I'm gonna do
first is start at the bottom of my brow
because I want to map out the shape okay
that is very very light and I actually
cannot do my brows with this color so
I'm gonna have to stop when I go find a
drugstore brow pencil that I do have and
I will be right back okay so I try to
look for a different brow pencil and I
couldn't find one that is drugstore in
my eyebrow color so I'm gonna have to do
my brows off-camera with a different
eyebrow pencil and then I'll be back
with my brows I'm so sorry for not doing
them on camera like I promised but I
will do them on camera next time for you
okay I am back with my brow oh my god my
hair looks ridiculous so now we're going
to move on to the eye shadow and the eye
shadow that I have today the eye shadow
palette is this one right here and this
is the new one from Maybelline the 24k
news
I definitely want to start off with this
matte nude I'm kind of really happy that
they have this in here like every
eyeshadow palette should have this nice
yellow tone nude matte in it because you
want to make sure that everything is
even it looks like one even skin tone
I'm going to take this morphe y 15 brush
we're gonna hack that nude shade on to
our eyes I'm going to take this all the
way up to the brow bone just so that
everything looks nice and even your
eyeshadow is just going to look a lot
better it's gonna blend easier it looks
gonna look a lot smoother I think what
I'm going to do is a halo look here I'm
going to start off with this matte Brown
and I'm going to work that on the inner
and outer parts of my eyelid because we
only have one Brown and it's dark I'm
going to take a very light hand because
I want it I want to start off with a
soft color so I'm going to take this
right here I'm just going to start right
on the outer part of my eye I'm just
gonna sweep the shadow edges over
towards the center like that I am gonna
stop there and I'm going to pick the
color that I want to be in the center of
my lid I'm going to go with this shade
right here on the center of the lid I'm
going to go into the dark brown and use
just a little bit of a heavier hand and
work out on the inner and outer part of
the lid and I'm just going to keep
building that up until I have the
intensity that I want I'm just patting
the shadow down and then I'm sweeping it
over towards the center so I'm just
buffing out the edges so that it blends
like that so it makes a little gradient
effect and then what I'm going to do is
just bring it over
straight through the crease the parts
that look harsh what I'm doing and I
just want to like really explain it as
best as I can to you guys so that when
you do it you're doing the same hand
motions the same pressure that's what I
feel like really makes you better at
doing makeup is the pressure that you
use and the way that you're working your
hand the way that you flick your wrist
it sounds crazy but it really makes a
difference between someone who is just
putting on eye shadow so now I'm going
to blend out that harsh edge and how I'm
going to do that is
by using a flicking motion and either
clean off your brush with like a napkin
you can like scrub it or I just cleaned
it on my pants because yellow or you can
use a clean brush if you want if you
have a clean brush that's pretty much
the same um what I'm going to do is I'm
going to use a soft flicking motions and
I'm going to flick my brush out just
where the edges are and that's how
you're going to get a really soft easy
blend so now it's blurred out there's no
harsh edge and it looks a lot nicer
anywhere that I see an edge I'm just
going to do that soft pressure short
flicking motions
I want to deepen up the edges a little
bit more so I'm going to add some of
that black color in there with the same
brush just Pat it on there and then
blend it out with that clean side okay
so on my brow bone I'm going to use that
nude shade we used earlier and this is
one of the morphe brushes that I hate
that I'm using is this so pretty but I'm
just going to use it because that's
what's next to me and I don't feel like
getting up easy problems I'm going to
pop into that brown shade we used
earlier and I'm gonna work it along the
lower part of the lash line so I'm just
sweeping it across into the inner
corners and then when I get to the edge
I'm going to use circular motions to
buff in that color I actually want to
layer this purple right on top of that
the brown and black I think it would
look really pretty so I'm going to take
this purple right here with this brush
that we've been using on the lower lash
line and I'm just going to work later
that right on top to give it a different
look I feel like having a purple hue
would be really pretty for this look
just bring it around the entire crease
all the way to the inner corner so it
looks like that it looks really pretty
actually so I'm going to go ahead and
line my waterline with this Milani
supreme Kohl Kajal black eyeliner line
up the waterline so now I'm going to
line the upper lash line and to do that
I'm use the Wet n Wild mega line and I
actually don't want to create a wing
with this look so I'm just going to
leave it right there and I just want it
to be more smoky and smudgy
King than anything so I'm just deepening
the the lashline so that my lashes look
saying I was walking through the aisle
looking for new drugstore stuff I saw
this and I was like ooh the spiky ball
at the end really caught my eye and then
just the way the wand looks so I really
wanted to try it from covergirl it's
called soul ashy the wand looks like
this in real life I'm not gonna lie to
you guys cuz you guys know I have
favorite mascaras it just wasn't like as
Wow as I thought it was gonna be
obviously this is a lot darker than this
lash cuz it has nothing on it but I just
was hoping for like a BAM effect I like
it for the bottom lashes would I
repurchase this probably not I actually
just got these in from ardell these are
their new faux mink lashes I don't feel
like I'm gonna need two sets of these
actually went out and finally got my
favorite lash glue this is the duo brush
on strip lash adhesive the best loss
glue ever I'm gonna go ahead and stick
these two lashes together and then I'm
going to pop them on to my eyelashes
okay the next new thing that I found at
the drugstore is this L'Oreal concealing
in contour kit it's the infallible total
cover so it looks like this inside it
has a little sponge I'm going to go
ahead and work my concealer brush into
this shade right here and I'm going to
create that v-shape so I just basically
mixed my brush into these two guys so
this is a color that works a little bit
better for my skintone I was actually
worried that they'd be too dark so this
is a good thing the sponge really helps
with smoothing out the edges so I'm just
going to use a sponge okay to contour
I'm going to take that shade in the
palette and I'm going to use this side
of my brush and just go down the side of
my nose this is a shade that I feel like
you should use as a bronzer because look
how orangie it is so um we're gonna just
do what we can with it because I'm gonna
stick to using all drugstore foundations
all drugstore makeup okay so the next
item I'm going to use is to set my under
eyes this is the wet and wild a mega
glow contouring I'm going to take this
shade just to go over the parts that we
did with the cream contour and then I'm
going to take this one the shade right
here just to and set all the areas that
I highlighted and concealed in place
going to tap the product where I wanted
so I want to intensify the nose a little
bit more I did the nose that I was like
okay you know I'm going to go ahead and
set everything before I do that on the
rest of the face I'm going to go ahead
and Pat that on just below so I'm going
to take the contour powder and I'm gonna
go right on top of that contour that I
did earlier and then start to brush it
upwards I'm going to use the L'Oreal
infallible pinks super vibrant color is
going to take that peachy shade sweeping
it right back into the hairline I almost
forgot the highlight I'm going to use
the the palette that I've been using
this entire time for the mirror I'm use
this elf palette right here it's called
the illuminating palette has four
different highlighters in here I'm going
to use this guy right here you know what
why not just use all of them
for the lips I'm going to take this
Milani color statement lipliner right
here it's a nude lip liner in the shade
0-4 I'm going to use this new Maybelline
nude lipstick this is the naked coral
matte so it looks like this very pretty
and I'm going to use that on my lips
today it smells really good
and this is a very creamy
nice big lipstick thank you guys for
