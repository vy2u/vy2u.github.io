channel
there's Eve makeup today a little hey
guys welcome back to my channel today
I'm going to be showing you how to get
this glittery glam Year's Eve makeup
look my last video of the year I am so
excited to be bringing you this look I
wanted to deduce I wanted to do
something that I would actually wear on
New Year's Eve just like a subtle pop of
glitter metallic something that is very
wearable for anyone and I would actually
wear this so I wanted to create
something like that that's very easy to
do for you guys you don't have to sit
there and pop on a bunch of different
colors keep it neutral keep it glam and
glittery I hope you guys enjoy this
video if you want to learn how to get it
then keep watching is it rolling okay so
I'm so excited to do this video it is
like the last video of the year and so
the products that I'm going to be using
in this video are going to be the ones
that are my ride-or-die go to products
because I trust them when you go out for
New Year's or you have a big occasion
you want to use makeup that you trust
and you know is going to work on your
skin and how it's going to feel and how
it's going to laugh so I primed my skin
with the base hydrate from Make Up For
Ever and that is just because my skin is
a little bit dry for the foundation my
go-to foundation for this year was the
Estee Lauder Double Wear this is a full
coverage foundation and I know that it's
going to last all night the only
difference with this foundation I'm
going to put some on my hand I just wish
it had a pump because it just look what
it does you know that's the only thing
but it wears well it I mean it covers
really good but the only thing I'm going
to do different with this is put in some
custom and future infusion drops from
cover effect this is the radiance drops
this foundation like it gives you a
little bit of a dry thick consistency
sometimes so what I'm doing is putting
in a few drops so that it makes it a
little bit more moisturizing and it just
goes on a little bit
better and smoother so I'm going to go
ahead and work that in with my tart
beauty sponge like how it just makes my
skin look really even and it also covers
really well under the eyes I start off
with a nice thin layer because I'm gonna
put on all of my eye makeup brows
everything and then I'm gonna go back to
my face I usually let that kind of sit
in and dry before I start on the rest of
my face for my brows today my hair is
such a different color so I'm gonna go
in with ebony I used to use evany back
in 2013 and so this is crazy to come
back to this guy right here just going
to create a line right underneath them
to kind of get the shape that I want and
then I'll start to fill them in in the
sparse areas I'm going to start here at
the front and with a soft hand feather
out that brow and I'm trying something a
little different with my brows instead
of making them go to a sharp point at
the end and kind of building them up
this just making them a little bit wider
at the end just building up where I need
to right in there it'll just look like
natural full brows and if you want to
really figure out where your point is it
should go right diagonal across your eye
and that's where your point should be
and then it should start right there at
the beginning of your eye diagonal and
then it should stop here to clean up the
brow hair as I go I'm using the benefit
Boeing industrial-strength concealer
this is what you'll be using to clean
them up and I'm using this morphe m-43
to brush like how clean the concealer
makes your your makeup look it really
enhances the shape of the brow it also
makes it look really clean gives you
that celebrity makeup artist kind of
makeup look so I'm going to go ahead and
Pat in the rest of the concealer use the
lemonade primer from benefit on my
eyelids and it's just this yellow primer
I feel like it color corrects
really nice six year I shot it last a
whole lot longer so now I'm going to get
into the eye shadow I'm going to take
this color pop eyeshadow and get lucky
so this one right here as you can see
I've really dug my finger into it pretty
hard so I'm going to go ahead and take
my finger because I feel like using your
finger with the color pop shadows it's
the best way to apply them when you use
a brush just let them go on as nicely or
at all but I'm going to go ahead and Pat
my feet on there because my claws are
super long I'm not going to be able to
get in there so what I'm going to do is
take this brush right here this is the
Sigma duo fiber blend and I'm just going
to make sure to get this guy in the
inner corner just to work it over and
there we go and then I'm going to go
ahead and go over top with this other
color pop shadow in cheap date it has
some glittery specks in it I'm going to
take a little bit of that and just pop
it onto the center basically the same
color but with some glitter chunks in it
and then for the crease I'm going to be
using a transition right here and just
go right around the lid I'm going to
darken it up a little bit more so I'm
going to take a different brush taking
this pencil brush right here from Tarte
pop into teddy bear and I'm just going
to work that into the outer socket
and then I'm going to take my luck
ZBrush again with that other transition
shade on it literally that's the name of
the eyeshadow and I'm going to go ahead
and work that just blend that in so that
they merge together so now I'm going to
go on to the eyeliner I'm going to take
my hat Von D liner about this baby one
because it came like a sample sized one
it came with the Too Faced Kat Von D
collab collections I always go back to
this one because it's so good it glides
on so nice and just smooth I'm going to
take this gold glitter from Urban Decay
this is the heavy metal glitter in
Midnight Cowboy I'm going to take that
I'm going to run it right across the top
of my eyeliner then I'm going to put a
little bit in this inner corner like a
little dot a heavier right in there not
gonna lie it kind of burns my eyelids a
little bit so you wear that kind of
birds and now I'm going to go ahead and
put some mascara on my favorite mascaras
and I've said before mascara is just a
mascara but actually no it's not
realized that there are really good
Oscars that make a difference on your
lashes on the length and the width and
everything this one from math girl it is
so good I mean this is this calll it's
called upward lash upward black is the
color this is going to make your lashes
look so freakin long if you have trouble
with your eyelashes standing up this one
is really good the brush grabs your lash
and the formula keeps it so I'm taking
this transition shade right here that we
used on our crease I'm using it on the
lash line as well this is a morphe y22
brush and I'm just working it right on
the lower lash line like so I'm going to
go back in with teddy bear and start to
darken up the bottom lash line and then
for that brow the brow bone highlight
I'm going to take thanks a lot a this
shade right here and to use my Joseph's
colors flat definer brush to
use that on my brow bone and just words
that on there like that press it down
into the other shades so that the
transition is really nice and everything
looks smooth and then for the waterline
I'm going to take the UH Nastasia luster
liner I'm gonna pop that onto the
waterline right now I just want subtle
metallic and pops of glitter here and
there I'm going to take this silver
glitter it's the urban decay heavy metal
glitter and glam rock and I'm going to
take that on the lower inner corner just
in case you're indecisive and can't
decide which one to use just use both of
them I mean why not okay so time for the
lashes I'm going to be using the House
of lashes in iconic so they're so glam
and so pretty these are my go to the lam
lashes let them dry for a little bit I'm
using the Tarte TARDIS Pro glue I hate
when it sticks in your eye and then your
blinking and every time I blames it like
scratches your eye a little bit it's the
worst so I always cut off the ends my
ultimate favorite lash glue though for
this year was the lash duo adhesive that
comes in this little tube it comes in a
tube like this it's white the best and
it doesn't stick to your eyes afterwards
doesn't leave that nasty residue it's a
good one so I'm going to let that dry
and while that's drying I'm just gonna
put on a little bit more foundation put
on some concealer I'm going to go ahead
and take this foundation just whatever
is on the end of the bottle and then I'm
gonna put it on the face the foundation
dries the color slightly changes you can
tell it's a little bit darker now when I
put it on it first looks a little
lighter so just let it dry for a little
bit while you do your while you do your
um shadow I'm gonna put some and
concealer on
for contour I'm going to be using the
Anastasia
evany stick foundation actually this is
not a contour color to stick foundation
but I like the color for contouring the
closer you make your lines on the con on
your nose the smaller your nose is going
to look so I want it to look a little
bit more pinched right on the tip so I
kind of curve it inwards instead of
making that straight line down my nose
it just flows a little bit nicer so now
I'm going to seal everything in place
I'm going to use my hello flawless
benefit powder soap this is a powder
foundation rest that into my skin make
sure nothing moves around
trust me this makeup is not going to
move around if you are doing every step
that I'm doing in this video your
makeups gonna last until the next
morning until the next afternoon so I'm
going to go ahead and bronze up my skin
I've been loving this it cosmetics
sunshine in a compact it's a matte
bronzer and I like how huge it is it
gives you a lot of products and I'm
going to be using my Kat Von D brushes
like a dual ended brush I'm gonna use
this dye and just start to work that
into my cheekbone and circular motions
really focusing on the hairline area and
then for the blush I'm going to take
this really pretty peachy blush from ex1
it's called a pretty in peach it's this
one right here and when it comes to
color on the cheeks I would like to keep
it behind the cheekbone makes it look a
little bit more natural and just gives
you a really nice glow for my highlight
I'm going to take artist Couture's Coco
bling I'm just going to take what's in
this top I'm not it almost one of these
brushes also going to get the tip of my
nose and my Cupid's bow and now I'm
going to go ahead and do my lips I'm
going to take this makeup forever
lipliner in number 12 and overlined my
lips of course and for the lip I'm going
to use this city color matte lipstick
and Chloe it's a really pretty nude
color these two colors blend really well
together by the way I love this color
