in my mouth it's taste so good so weird
hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today I'm gonna be doing this full
coverage spring glam look right here
we're covering up our past president
future with this foundation and
concealer right here I am so full
coverage right now and I'm loving it but
I'm also super spring I love this
freaking look I know you guys are gonna
love it too I used the makeup Shayla X
color pop perception collection which
you guys will see how I feel about this
freaking collection in this video so if
you want to see how I achieved this look
right here then don't forget to
subscribe to my channel and hit that
notification bell so you can be a part
of the quad family and without further
ado let's get on to the video
okay so I had the worst allergic
reaction last week I tried like a new
concealer and my whole entire under eyes
were burning itching red scaly and super
puffy like I just got two black eyes so
I'm just healing from it and right here
you can see it's still a little puffy
but it's gone down so much I didn't put
on makeup in like a week because of it
because oh so scared is gonna come back
but I think my face looks how it
normally looks just you know regular
dark circles instead of like extreme
black eye under-eye circles so I'm gonna
start off with moisturizing my face and
I have not been using primer which is so
crazy cuz usually I use primer like some
type of primer on my face before
foundation I'm trying to open this guy
because it's new I've been using the
first sauly drops the ones that I use
are the volcanic elixir ones but I just
got these in the rose gold elixir I
thought would be really pretty for this
spring look and it doesn't really do
much I don't think maybe I think it
helps with radiance in your skin so
we're gonna try it out today and I have
been using this instead of primer and
it's been so amazing I just look how
pretty it is it's just so pretty look at
that gorge
so I'm just gonna put that in my hand
and then work it into my hand and then
start to work just Pat it into my skin
okay so now that our skin is prepped and
hydrated I'm gonna go ahead and start to
put some foundation on the foundation
we're going for full coverage like full
glam full coverage so I'm
to take the hourglass stick Foundation
which I haven't used in so long this is
the beige shade but I also have nude
some like right in between the two
sometimes I'm gonna take nude and it's
just the easiest way to put on
foundation it's the quickest way because
it's just the stick and you just draw
lines on your face and then blend it in
it's so fast so easy and this particular
stick is super full coverage like it is
the number one full coverage stick
foundation that I've ever seen I'm gonna
put that into my skin with a Beauty
Blender and I'm just gonna work it in I
think this actually you can put this in
with a brush or a Beauty Blender either
one works some people like to use a
brush with this and I kind of understand
why but I'm just so used to using the
Beauty Blender that I just feel like
nothing else will work better than this
guy you see how full coverage that is
like you just covered up everything like
all my acne when my discoloration my
mustache my under-eye circles are about
to disappear we are just gonna put on a
new face my under eyes are really crusty
right now so now that we have the base
on I'm gonna go ahead and do my brows
really quick just so that they look
normal
I'm gonna use the same o samo trusty
foolproof brow powder from benefit I've
used this in a hundred videos you guys
know I'm shade 5 if you follow my videos
pretty often if you're new hi my name is
Kristin Dominique and I am a benefit
brow addict so I'm just gonna fill in my
brows really quick just nothing crazy
nothing fancy just trying to get them to
look a little normal I take the back the
darkest part and I fill in the back part
of my eyebrow so I just follow it brows
are on our face so now we can move on so
I wanted to try this out today it's like
a pink cream matte eye color from dose
of colors you can use this as an
eyeliner or as a cream base so I'm gonna
do that this is a sleepover it's a
really pretty pink color and I'm gonna
use that all over my entire lid just so
that I can have like a really pretty
soft pink base I want this look to be
very spring blush girly so I wanna try
putting this down all over the eye first
patting it on with my ring finger really
really close into my lash
and all over the lid up into the crease
even going a little bit above the brow
bone so and then with this other clean
finger I'm just gonna dab the edges so
it looks like you know smooth so I'm
gonna do the same thing with the other
side so now we have that on as a base I
was super easy we're gonna put that down
and we're gonna go into with this
palette that I'm so excited about this
is the perception palette from Shayla X
color pop and I've already used it all
of the shades are super super pigmented
creamy buttery melting goodness those of
you who saw my stories I was like I was
in shock these are amazing
the first color to pick up is culture
like this matte warm shade right here so
I'm gonna take culture so we're gonna
put that on with a brush I'm gonna take
this one right here with makeup shock T
107 or T 67 I'm gonna take culture and
start to work that right on the crease
just go back and forth I'm actually
gonna move my hand back a little bit
just so I can have a little bit more of
a softer touch I'm gonna work it around
circular motions I'm also gonna bring it
around here I'm gonna go half way in
like that right around for the next
color I'm gonna pick up September this
really pretty pink color right here I'm
gonna put it all over the lid so I'm
gonna take a flat brush to press that
into the lid I'm gonna take this brush
right here and start to press that into
the skin like right into the lid ooh
that is that screams spring to me I'm
gonna go back in with culture that matte
shade just to soften the edges here a
little bit I'm gonna take a bigger
fluffy brush to blend all of these
sheets together just so that they're all
soft and nothing is harsh there's no
hard stops along the way like everything
is just like I like it I like it I'm
gonna go in with spill the tea this
shade looks like pretty rose gold
looking shade got a pale rose gold I'm
gonna take that on the inner corners
I think that's the name of one of her
lips right on the brow bone I'm gonna
take unbothered which is the lightest
simmer shade right here I'm gonna take a
little bit of that looked like a soft
like a little tiny brush like this and
I'm just gonna apply it on the arch just
highlighting the high points of your eye
it just gives you that extreme I'm gonna
slay the day kind of look I'm gonna take
the darkest color called played out it's
a matte brown color look at that pig I'm
not flicking you guys off but look at
that pigment right there
insane literally it's like paint I'm
gonna start to work that on the lash
line right there okay because this is
very pigmented really make sure you tap
your brush and use a very soft hand but
I'm gonna go ahead and do that in the
same direction just lifting this is
gonna lift the eye and add some
dimension but it's not gonna be like a
harsh extreme wing so there's not gonna
be any type of hard edge to this not
even at the bottom I'm just gonna make
it all very soft and there is a little
too much pigment on here so I'm gonna
take a clean semi clean brush house like
a lighter shade on it and I'm just gonna
start to soften the edge so that we
don't have any edges it's really soft
for mascara I'm gonna use the benefit
roller lash just coat them up just a
little bit because we're gonna put
lashes on anyways so I want to make sure
they're nice and black I'm gonna focus
more on the lower lash line lashes
because we won't be using lashes on the
bottom and even if I have some right
here that I might want to use but I
always end up not wanting to use them
because I have a hard time putting them
on to be honest and you know let's see
how this works out for us okay this is a
really nice mascara I'm gonna put on
these huda beauty fairs that I found
like I probably used them like twice and
then save them and then you use new ones
so I'm gonna pop on these huda beauty
fair lashes right here and I will be
right back
Wow that is the quickest I've ever done
my eyes in a really long time so it's
like really easy to do this type of look
eyes are basically done I'm gonna go
ahead and move on to the rest of my face
I'm gonna put on some concealer the one
I'm going to use today is from x1 it's
there delete fluid full coverage
concealer in the shade 1.0 so it's a
very light I'm going to take it on the
back of this here click in a little pump
which is nice I'm going to take some on
my Beauty Blender and just brighten
those under eyes back to life
to set my under eyes I'm gonna take this
two-faced peach perfect who I love when
I get a little bit of this in my mouth
it's tastes so good so weird I haven't
used this in a while because I lost it
and I just found it recently something
like ebony in today's video I absolutely
love this one because it truly brightens
your under eyes and it doesn't give you
a flashback it tastes good it smells
good all the good things so I'm gonna
use this I'm just set the under eyes and
while I'm setting my under eyes I'm
gonna go ahead and contour my face using
another fav I use this all the time my
favorite contour palette this is the Kat
Von D shade + light contour palette and
I take this middle shade and use it to
contour my entire face I'm gonna use
this I'm gonna use the good old brush I
forgot what this is called from it's
from NARS but I used to use this a lot
to contour I haven't used in a while I
forgot why I'm gonna take it right on
the cheekbone to really hollow it out
now I'm gonna take this yellowish shade
right here and I'm gonna put it right
down the center of the nose right at the
tip I'm gonna take off the powder that I
had earlier honestly it's emphasizing
the dry spots that I have from whatever
happened to my under eyes last week so
it looks a little weird to be honest but
I just can't help it it's a super dark
so I'm gonna go ahead and take a there's
this really beautiful full coverage
powder from wander Beauty it's like a
foundation powder but I'm gonna use this
under my eyes if this covers up
everything so I'm hoping this will
actually help me brighten my under eyes
okay so for bronzer my go-to bronzer is
this one right here for Marc Jacobs
it's the tantric bronzer look how big
this pan is it's the size of my head but
I'm gonna go ahead and take this brush
right here and start to warm up my face
for the highlight I'm going to take the
Shay Lex color pop boom in loose powder
highlighter right here I have to show
you what this looks like on my hand
whoa look at that I'm gonna take this
highlighter and pop it on my cheeks so
that is a very beautiful highlight and
for the blush I'm gonna take the NARS
resole it's a really pretty pink color I
just thought this is so springy so I'm
gonna take this blush right here and
normally I don't go for these like
shimmery blushes but this blush is
perfect for this look so I'm gonna
ignore my skin texture and just put it
on my face to see what it looks like oh
we're gonna be able to see all the
texture today doesn't look bad though
when you have a full coverage foundation
and all the full coverage underneath
with the concealer and the powder when
you put like a shimmery something on top
it does not look as bad as you think it
will it actually looks pretty good and
you can see the color and the shimmer
instead of your texture trust me
if you use a full coverage foundation
full coverage concealer the powder you
will be able to use a shimmer on top and
it will look very very pretty do it do
it to it so we're almost done for the
lips I'm gonna take this lip liner I was
trying to figure out which of the pliner
I wanted to use and I'm gonna take this
one this is called exposed from Kylie
it's one of her lip liners I love how
soft her lip liners are so we have like
really pink cheeks eyes so I wanted to
go for more of a warmer lip so that's
why I chose exposed and then for the
lipstick right on top
she has three lipstick that she came out
with she came out with kwikki which is
the one I'm thinking of minis today
which is a very pretty nude very very
nudey nude and then she has this one
right here which is called ooh I like
this one this is like a really pretty
orange color and then the last one is
come on sis this is really pretty too I
feel like you can wear these at any time
of the day I'm gonna take quickie and
see what that looks like yeah I think
I'm gonna go at this one so so pretty I
love love this color I'm gonna take her
gloss to the gloss is the ultra glossy
lip it's called a neat-freak
and it's this one right here so pretty
can you guys tell it is just so
beautiful it's clear but it's like so
like the pink shimmery
