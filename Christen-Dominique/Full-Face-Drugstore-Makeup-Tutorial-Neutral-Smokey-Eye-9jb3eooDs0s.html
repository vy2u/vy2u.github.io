today I have Bobo with me she looks like
grumpy cat isn't she like the baby
version and she likes when I do that
she's cute so I'm going to be doing this
look right here and I asked you guys on
snapchat what type of drugstore makeup
look you wanted to see and gonna show
those snaps requested for this look you
ready are you ready Bobo oh hi Kristen
that was wondering to a makeup look
that's like doing a post but for school
hydra-matic but still
full coverage for a pound
never did
I know this has been out forever but
this is my first time trying the baby
skin poreless eraser primer for
foundation i'm using the loreal
infallible Pro matte foundation this is
a Demi matte finish and I've been
wanting to try this for a while
we're concealer I'm going to use the
L'Oreal True Match and this is in fair
light warm right here and I got a
lighter concealer because I wanted to
also use it as a highlight so I'm going
to put it under my under eye circles
right on the cheekbone my nose is my
small mini beauty blender to blend out
the concealer so I'd rather use the big
Beauty Blender than the small mini one
just because it does the same thing I
tried it but I think I'd rather use the
big one so I'm gonna fill in my brows
with this Ardell brows defining kit what
I think is super cool about this is that
you can actually use these for your
eyeshadow too
there's 3 map and then it has a shimmer
right here for your highlights so I'm
going to use this one right here for my
brows and a little bit of this ashy
color right here
I'm going to use the wax pencil that
came with a kit just to brush my hairs
upwards so that the hairs look extra
defined and precise and you know so
we're our brows can be on fleek today so
I'm going to use these for my crease
what's cool about this is that you can
use it for your brows and your eyeshadow
so I'm going to take this reddish brown
color right here because blending brush
and just blend it into the crease so now
I'm going to take this darker shade
right here and I'm going to take a flat
brush I'm going to place the color where
I want it on the crease and then with a
fluffy brush I'm just going to blend the
edges outwards and upwards
I want to give my bottom lash line is
smoky hazy kind of looks so I'm going to
take the same shadows that I've used in
a crease and we'll blend it down at the
bottom lash line now I'm going to move
on to the lid I was going to use a
shadow a cream shadow it didn't turn out
very well you follow me on snapchat you
know what happened so I'm going to use
the Physicians Formula shimmer palette
and this is the eye shadow / eyeliner
palette but I'm just going to use it for
eyeshadow today so I'm taking this color
right here it's like a pinky champagne
color like that and I'm pop it onto the
lid
now I'm going back into the crease to
deepen it up just a little bit more to
create my wing I chose to use the
Physicians Formula cat i sexy booster
collection I honestly chose to use their
mascara and their eyeliner just because
of the packaging because the packaging
gets me every time
all right so now it's mascara time I'm
going to use this mascara from
Physicians Formula it's from that same
cat i sexy booster line and this is an
ultra black isn't this really cute
packaging so I'm just going to apply a
little bit of mascara and then we're
gonna do some lashes for the sake of the
video I'm going to run through the
mascara part and get straight into the
lashes now I'm going to put on some
lashes these are from ardell these are
the 120 Demi's and they are natural but
they still have that glam flair to them
so I thought this was perfect for you
guys who wanted to look glam but subtle
wearable for school or work so I'm just
gonna pop these onto the center of my
lash line and I'll be right back with
lashes okay so now it's time to set the
makeup in place I'm going to use this
NYX finishing powder this NYX HD
finishing powder in banana and I'm just
going to buff it into my skin so that it
lasts longer and adds a just a tiny bit
more coverage so I got some requests for
a sharp drugstore contour I tried my
hardest to look for a matte bronzer I
found this one from Physicians Formula
this is their bronze booster it's a two
in one bronzer and highlight I love the
packaging by the way in for a sharp
contour you definitely want to use a
brush that's densely packed like this
one so it packs more color in that area
so I'm going right underneath the
cheekbone very close to the hair
so here I'm taking it around the temples
going across the forehead but you want
to keep it as close to the hairline as
possible if you want to make it look as
natural as possible and then I'm just
going to do my nose just to straighten
it out a bit and then I'm just blending
it upwards and outwards I'm going to
take this blush right here from NYX this
is in amber it's a matte blush and I'm
going to just sit right on top of the
contour and the highlights going to go
right above it like a sandwich I'm going
to go back into this bronzer right here
with the gold highlight for the
highlight hide it right on top of the
tops of the cheekbones
so some of you guys asked for a bold lip
but I also got requests that they wanted
to look to be wearable for school or for
work so what I did was choose a color
that was right in between bold to medium
so I have this color right here this is
from NYX this is a gingersnap and I'm
going to mix it with this lip liner
right here and this is what is plum so
plum it mix with ginger so now I'm going
to line my lips I'm gonna actually stay
with my natural lip line today and then
after that I'm going to top it off with
the ginger snap this lip gloss right
here that I'm about to show right now
now okay so what you want to do is make
sure you stay on top of the lash the lip
line so that it blends really nicely and
this is what it looks like and that's it
