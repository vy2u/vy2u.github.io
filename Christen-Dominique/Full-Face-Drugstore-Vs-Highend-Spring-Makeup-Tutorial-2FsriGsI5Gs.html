firstworldproblems my grandma just
commented on my Instagram photo we are
about to save some money honey stop
right there don't go further than this
comment below which side you think is
drugstore which side do you think is
high-end hey guys welcome back to my
channel so today I'm going to be doing a
high-end verse drugstore makeup tutorial
I don't remember which side actually I
do know that we are gonna compare and
see if there are dupes if they are the
exact same so you can spend a lot less I
will let you know my thoughts at the end
of this video so keep watching if you
want to know which one I like better
when I upload this video as soon as I
post it I'm gonna be reading your guys's
comments to see which one you guys think
cuz it was so interesting you don't
forget to subscribe to my channel before
you leave and hit that notification bell
if you want to learn how to save some
money if you want to get some exact
dupes for high-end makeup then keep
watching this house high-end over here I
have drugstore over here let's do this
so I already primed my face I was going
back and forth on the foundations
because during the spring I want my skin
to glow more I was trying to figure out
what is going to be a dupe to something
that is glowing in the drugstore so the
first thing I thought was proclo and
fallible pro glow I know it works I know
it's good I like it a lot the closest
thing that I found to being glowy or
radiant that I have is the Estee Lauder
Double Wear it comes in this little
compact right here and you just press
this and it comes out this is a lot
lighter than the Double Wear like this
one the one that comes in the bottle
this one's a lot thicker and heavier
this will give you more coverage this
one is very light luminous radiant so
I'm going to go ahead and use this guy
for my high-end side of my face I'm
going to use my new Sigma sponge like
the 3ds bun and I am going to work that
in with my Sigma booty blow
under I always like to start off with
just a light base of foundation I
usually end up putting on a little bit
more once I'm done with my eyes I just
don't put that part in because this
video would be very very long now we're
going to go on the high end side of my
face so I'm going to use this estee
lauder one it comes with a little sponge
I can't use this punch so I'm going to
go in with this right here and I'm just
going to okay this is a different color
the other side's a little bit darker
this is tawny that's so weird Tawny's
usually my shade so there goes both
sides they both feel really light but
for some reason this one feels lighter
the estee lauder feels lighter on my
skin this side feels lighter
it looks lighter it feels lighter and I
feel like the coverage is very light too
I feels a lot heavier on this side
you're already very content with your
skin and you just want a really nice
even luminous skin tone then this side
will be like perfect this one will
probably feel a little too heavy for you
I would go with this side the l'oreal
side just because it gives me more
coverage but at the same time I'm still
getting that glow shining through still
pretty good coverage without being full
coverage in your face cake you know to
me when it comes to these two guys I
will have to say I am going with this
one because it gives me more coverage
but I still have that luminous glow to
my skin which I really love which one
would you go with this one or this one
this one
okay so the next thing that I'm going to
do is fill in these brows use the Loreal
brow stylist definer on the high-end
side I'm going to go with the Anastasia
brow Wiz in medium brown so pretty much
the same shape same size let's start
right here by the arch bring it in I
actually really like how my brow just
turned out right now this side of my
face we're going to be using the
Anastasia brow Wiz and medium brown
start to fill this little guy in just
brushing on this one you really don't
have to continuously brush back and
forth because it's already really
nice and dark this is more of a warm
tone this is more of the ashy tone I
like both wouldn't mind using one or the
other to be honest I think they're both
really really good they do the same
thing they look the same it's really
hard to find a good brow pencil in a
drugstore brand I would definitely buy
this so the next item I'm going to use
is concealer and I'm using the Loreal
infallible total cover versus the Make
Up For Ever concealer palette let's test
them out let's see which one is going to
work for us for the L'Oreal you start to
work that underneath my under eyes the
coverage is good it is a little bit more
of a drier formula but I would have to
say this is definitely a full coverage
if you have really heavy dark under-eye
circles it works really really good I'm
going to blend everything else in with
the Beauty Blender
so this concealer is very full coverage
a little bit dry now we're gonna try the
Make Up For Ever side and I'm going to
work that alongside my nose right in
that inner corner I'm gonna work it
outwards this one isn't as dry as the
other one but it also doesn't have as
much coverage as the other one you don't
really need to cover like a deep set
dark under-eye circle this one's going
to work for you just fine I like the way
it brightens that brightens up a little
bit more than this one does but this one
just looks a lot more natural if I have
to choose I like both of them what do
you guys think now we're going to get
into the eye shadow for the eye shadow I
have the Stila palette this is the matte
metal eye shadow palette it looks like
this it's really pretty and Mavi for the
mob and nudes in this palette I found
this palette right here which is from
covergirl this is the true Naked Roses
palette it has those Bobbi nude shades
in there and those are the colors that
I'm going to be comparing so we're going
to test out the shadow quality and see
what we get so the first color I'm going
to pick up is this really pretty light
pink right here this is called velvet
and I'm going to pick it up with a
morphe m-52 4 brush work that all over
the lid I'm not going to go up to the
brow bone with this but I'm just going
to keep it right on the lid I really
like the pigmentation on all these
colors I like that
isn't really any fallout when you put
them on and it's it's quality is just
amazing I'm going to go into the
covergirl roses palette and I'm going to
use this pink right here so very light
pretty pastel pink and the shade right
here is called baby pop it on to the lid
there's a lot of fallout of this one
it's a little bit darker than the other
shadow I would definitely use some sort
of eyeshadow primer before doing
anything with this palette this shadow
is very chalky like I wanted to like you
the next color I'm going to take from
the Stila palette is suede this really
pretty mom and imma start to work that
into my crease take this deeper shade of
mom which I'm very scared to take right
now so I'm gonna take some of this shade
and the crease look at it like it's all
like settled right here the shadows
don't really blend well together
the next color I'm going to pick up in
this palette right here is this one this
is retro put that right on the inner
corners there's a really pretty rose
gold looking shadow for this eye I'm
going to take this shadow right here
which is pretty much the same work it in
there there's so much fallout on this
eyeshadow for the brow bone I'm going to
take this shade right here this is
feather so I'm going to take this color
right here this is almond and I'm just
going to start to Pat that on my brow
bone this side actually doesn't look bad
the colors are really pretty
they pretty much match except for the
crease shade I think it's got really
dark and ashy on the side I'm going to
say this one is definitely a no for me I
can't handle the amount of fallout it
has it's not blendable at all I mean if
you blend it it's all gonna fall off of
your face this one I like the colors
they are pigmented there's no fallout so
I'm just going to definitely go with the
Stila for the lower lash line hey these
Purple's right here this is from L'Oreal
this is their eyeliner pencil I can't
pronounce that so there it goes for you
you know how to pronounce it let me know
this is pure purple it's a matte purple
this one is from Marc Jacobs so this is
the matte gel crayon in the color line
pop this
to the lower lashline I mean the
waterline literally inside your eyeball
that is a very pigmented purple it went
down really nice on the drugstore I'm
going to go ahead and use the L'Oreal
one it's a few strokes to get the color
down on there for sure I'm gonna have to
say this one goes on a lot better both
colors are nice this one's a little bit
darker than this one I actually really
like how the shades on this eye are
working for spring so I'm not going to
say these are dupes because they're
definitely a little bit off on color
they both have something different about
them that I like so yeah this one or
this one for lashes I have the elf
lashes in star struck and for the high
end lashes I'm choosing these Lily
lashes in opulence
they're both layered out wispy
natural-looking
but we are going to try these out and
see they're the same or which one is
better let's see okay wait I'm gonna
stop that before we go any further I'm
gonna bake under my eyes so I have the
elf translucent powder on this side on
this side I have the cover effects
translucent powder take the cover
effects on the black sponge and then on
the drugstore side I'm going to take the
elf it seems like the elf translucent
powder is a lot more fine than this one
so we're gonna let that sit there for a
little bit while while we put on our eye
lashes battle of the lashes the Lily
lashes are a little bit thinner feeling
these are a little bit thicker let's
just put them on our eyes and see what
the difference is okay so I definitely
was off on the length because the elf
lashes are a lot shorter and the Lily
lashes are a whole lot longer and
they're round and fluffy they have a
little bit more lashes in between the
little spikes and the little spikes on
this side that's it that's all you get I
would spend a little bit more money and
buy this one because I can wear it more
often and I'll get a really pretty look
out of it just by putting on the lash it
already did it's so much more for
look okay so now I'm just going to take
off this powder that was the elf side
that came off really fast and now I'm
going to take off the cover effects side
which doesn't come off very easy and I
think I put too much because my under
eyes are getting wrinkly decide it just
looks a lot softer this one is a good
one I use it all the time I think maybe
I used too much and it created these
little wrinkles under my eyes but this
one looks very smooth I would buy this
this is worth the money I would buy this
too but if you're looking for a cheap
translucent powder that is good I would
get this one I'm actually really liking
the drugstore side it's just sad because
I know that this eyeshadow is not going
to stay on next we're going to go into
the blush for the drugstore side I have
the wet and wild color icon in the shade
mellow wine versus the tart captivating
blush which is one of my favorites first
I'm going to use a wet and wild shade
and I'm going to pop that onto my cheeks
I like the way it blends it's pretty
nice I like it
I'm nothing bad to say about it the
other side I'm going to be using Tarte
you get a lot of color payoff with just
one little swipe on this one Tarte
captivating is definitely my favorite
blush for any look this one is usually
my go-to if you want something that's a
little bit more affordable for you
you're going to get the same color with
the wet and wild mellow wine I'm so
excited for this one so we are going to
highlight her face now the packaging is
so beautiful this is the Lancome LaRose
blush illuminator taking me back to
before I was born and we open it I'm
obsessed with it look how pretty this is
so I would definitely have to say that
the Milani strobe light and number one
is somewhat of a dupe for it so we are
going to place that on our cheekbone the
luminosity is there it's very light it's
a little chalky it's nice for more of a
natural looking glow I'm going to go
ahead and try the dupe to this which is
the Milani and pop it on to the Chi you
get more color payoff on this one if I
had to choose between the two I'm gonna
have to say I'm and she's Milan
we are down to the lips the first one is
the drugstore which is the Loreal
collection exclusive this is liya Spink
and then on the high-end side I have
Mac's lip tensity and arrows they're
pretty much the same color they are very
much the same we're gonna try the
drugstore side first when it comes to
springtime I really like these bright
pretty colors this is the Mac lip
tensity oh shoot right away like right
away one swipe and I'm done it's a
little bit darker than this side but
pretty much the same you don't have to
keep going over it to get that really
nice vibrant color even though I know
this side is gonna last and it's better
quality I really like the way this side
