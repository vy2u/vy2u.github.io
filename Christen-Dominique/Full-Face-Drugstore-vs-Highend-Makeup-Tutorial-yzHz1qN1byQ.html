how that you know great look at that
shade
there's look how weird I look hello
gonna be so good still in my room I
promise you this is just a blue paper
that I have in the back and a cool fancy
flickering light back there that's not
actually supposed to be flickering seen
this video circulating all around
YouTube it's so popular right now and
honestly I think it's so helpful this
was a really interesting video for me
because I realized that there's so many
things that I absolutely love that are
high end and you can find them as a
drugstore brand and I was amazed and I'm
so excited to show you guys all of these
drugstore products that work the exam as
the high end for a lot cheaper price so
I hope you guys find this very helpful
to you and I love this mommy look I hope
you guys enjoy it as well
also I want to tell you guys that this
scoop my nose itches a little bit so if
you want to learn how to get it then
keep my hot cheetos 9 Jersey nice I'm
ready so this is super exciting I'm
going to be using Tarte foundation on
this side and the dream matte velvet on
this side start off with the Tarte
Amazonian clay full coverage foundation
if you like the consistency of the dream
matte velvet is pretty much the same as
the Tarte one we're going to see how
well it works in comparison this
foundation works really well for
textured skin because it sounds like a
primer like feel to it
so it really fills in all the fine lines
and the large pores so that's why I keep
going back to this one because it makes
your skin look so smooth and it's full
coverage so getting that on this half of
my face over at my redness around my
eyes now I'm going to take the dream
velvet soft matte hydrating foundation
from Maybelline and this is in the shade
pure beige 70 you see what I mean it's
like pretty much the same consistency
it's like a primer almost so I'm going
to take the other side of my Beauty
Blender and use this on the other side
my face it's so weird to only put it on
half of your face but it's all in a good
cause
this one covers pretty well too just
gonna add a little bit more coverage is
pretty good so far I don't on the
foundation I don't see a difference
besides the Maybelline being a little
bit of the pinky undertone but that's
pretty much it they're both pretty good
so if you're looking for something
that's just like the Tarte Amazonian
clay full coverage foundation get this
guy for the concealer I'm going to start
with this I gotta remember which side it
is I take my favorite one this is the
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer I'm
just going to put it right underneath my
eye to hide those dark circles my little
trick for it to last long there is just
to leave it there for a few seconds and
then start to apply the other one so
what I'm going to do is take the master
concealer from Maybelline and I'm going
to take that on my finger and apply it
very close to the inner corners after I
feel like it's been on there for a while
I'll just kind of spread it out and
blend it into my the rest of my skin and
voila
no more under-eye circles okay now for
the brows I have this NYX sculpt and
highlight Rood pickup this NYX brow
pencil this is the sculpting highlight
in brunette I'm going to use this on the
side this eye over here
done with that eyebrow took a bit of
work now I'm going to go onto the other
eye using the benefits precisely my brow
this is my current favorite brow product
right now first let's talk about how I
did these completely different with both
products really excited about this part
because I actually found a palette
that's completely and utterly the dupe
for the Naked 3 palette let me pull them
out so today I'm going to be doing a ma
feed really pretty look on the eyes so I
have the Naked 3 for that I think this
is the perfect palette to create any mob
you look that you want this is the Naked
3 right here and so I got really excited
when I found this wet and wild palette
this is in nude Awakening it's basically
the same thing just in a small condensed
palette and it's a lot cheaper than this
guy let's go ahead and see how the
shadows compared to each other taking a
Mac 224 and the shade limit which is
this light mommy pink and nooner mix
them together and apply them to the
crease we're going to go ahead and go
into this shade right here it kind of
looks like a mixture of nooner and limit
and it's mad one of them that topi
shades in the palette which is perfect
for the crease
this eyeshadow blends really really well
and I don't know if it's just because
it's on my good eye with a good crease
but it's really good for the lid I'm
going to go in with buzz and to me the
exact dupe to buzz is this one isn't
that crazy pretty much all the first row
shades are the same exact colors from a
mid Naked 3 palette look at buzz and
look at that shade
there's look how weird I look hello so
when I found this palette I was like
I've got to do this video gonna be so
good so I'm going to go ahead and take
this brush and pack on that middle shade
Urban Decay's is obviously more
pigmented but that's okay it can always
build up I'm going to take this pink
shade right here this is dust pack that
onto the inner corner
and then with my wet and Wilde's brush
I'm going to go in with the second color
in this palette very much the same as
dust for the crease we're going to
darken it up go ahead and take dark side
I'm going to focus this on the outer
part of my lid and then I'm going to
work it all the way into my outer crease
okay now I'm going to go in on the other
side with this shade which is pretty
similar to darkside this is pretty much
the same exact look with a cheaper
palette so um and I'm using the LA girl
fine line eyeliner for this once a pen I
like pen I feel like they're more
precise here more control that was not
bad at all this is a pretty good one
okay so now I'm going to use my usual
eyeliner that I always use which is the
Kat Von D liner just love it it's so
easy it glides on so easy um this one is
super pigmented though it wasn't as nice
and soft and glide II like this one but
it was really really pigmented which I
really like and the point was really
nice too so I'm going to go ahead and
start on this eye
between the both of these guys I'm gonna
have to still go with Kat Von D's
trooper because it's just so much easier
and faster okay for mascara I'm going to
be using the wet and wild mascara gonna
use it it's mascara let me just speed
this up
and then for the higher-end side I'm
going to use the tart tart artist
mascara
and honestly guys to me and mascara as a
mascara is a mascara so I don't know
what to say about it what do you think
all right so the next thing I am going
to do is put on my eyelashes for the
eyelashes I'm just gonna go and use
whatever eyelash that I find floating
around I'm gonna go ahead and do this
off camera I'll be back for the rest of
my face bye oh when he focuses the
camera he has to go super close up and
you can literally see my like little
bitty hair peach fuzz all over my nose
it's so gross but anyways getting back
gonna go ahead and contour my face I
thought this is pretty interesting
wet-and-wild has a dual ended contour
stick which is pretty cool this is very
light very light I feel like it doesn't
do anything this is the only shade I had
and it looks pretty dark but I don't
know let's see what happens and then on
this side
okay now I'm going to blend it all out
to different contours but we'll see how
this works out
this one blends like they just melts
into your skin
you guys decide tarts or wet in the wild
I'm going to set my face with a powder
on this side of my face I'm going to use
the Laura Mercier translucent powder and
set my foundation this is one of the
best translucent powders so I have
really high standards for translucent
powder which is all over my eye Brown
but my skin looks so much softer now and
then I'm going to go in with the
Maybelline setting powder which is right
here
so tbh I don't see the difference in
these powders I would literally have to
wear these powders for more than eight
hours to really kind of compare them so
they look the same to me so now we're
going onto the lips I have found and
been in love with candy cave from Kylie
Jenner and I've also found I'm so
excited when I found this I'm colour-pop
this is not a drugstore brand but you
can buy it online and it's very very
affordable aquarius mixed with clueless
match for candy kay matte lipstick so
i'm going to go ahead and try to do this
on one side of my face which is going to
be really weird i love color pop by the
way and they're so affordable so good
it's ridiculous okay so here we go candy
kay
alright so now let's get onto the liquid
lipsticks i'm going to go ahead and take
clueless from colour-pop
and put it on this side and candy kay
okay so this is a lot more warm than
what I was thinking
let's try coke okay
hmm so this one dries superfast this one
is stays a little bit more moist and
it's not as drying as this one but um
they're not actually duplicates but
they're very similar
I tried candy k and it was totally not a
duplicate at least on my lips it wasn't
so um this is what it looks like this is
definitely not it's like very close but
just no cigar so this is the final look
honestly I don't see much of a
difference the only difference that I
see is the shade difference in my lips I
thought this was like the exact dupe but
it definitely is not the exact dupe
Kylie one feels much more moisturizing
and then this one the skin that looks
pretty much the same I mean the eyes
shadow looks the same eyeliner
everything everything looks the same so
if you asked me there's really no
difference in the look so I'm gonna ask
you guys thank you guys for watching I
hope you enjoyed this look I had so much
fun doing it I mean it was kind of weird
to be honest because like doing half of
your face
with products and the other half is
another it's just weird but let me know
what you think about it in the comments
below and if you miss this video then
you wouldn't be seeing it right now if
you like this video go ahead and thumbs
it up and if you missed my last two
videos they're gonna be below for you
