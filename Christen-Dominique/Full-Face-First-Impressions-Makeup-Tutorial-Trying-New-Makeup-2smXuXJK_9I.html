welcome back to my channel so today I'm
gonna be doing full face of first
impressions all new makeup that I got in
and I'm super excited because I'm gonna
be using the new k'kaw X Mario collab
palette I am so excited to show you guys
this palette and I am talking with a
list in this video because I just came
from the dentist why am i filming after
the dentist I don't know the show must
still go on so I have a list throughout
this entire video so try to just ignore
it but I'm gonna be using a bunch of new
stuff the new blush from a benefit the
gold rush blush the Katy WX Mario collab
some new Urban Decay Milani some
drugstore just a bunch of new things
that I cannot wait to show you and
really love how this look came out so if
you want to see how I got this look then
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
and hit that notification bells to give
me a part of the quad family and without
further ado let's get into the video I
already did my brows I prep my skin so
I'm just gonna jump in to the eyes
because I am using some color I don't
know how much fallout I'm gonna have I'm
using a new palette so I'm gonna save
the face for last the first thing that
I'm gonna do is pry my eyes I got this
thing in from Sigma it's the Sigma
persuade eyeshadow base primer this
little guy right here you know I don't
use primers I'm not like a primer fan
like a eye primer fan it just never
works out for me but I'm willing to take
a chance on this guy right here
so because it's very creamy I just I
tested it on my skin and it just looks
so creamy and soft I feel like this
would actually work on my eyelids
without making it hard to blend out so
I'm gonna go ahead and start to put this
on my lid
I love this color by the way and I like
that it color corrects as you go which
is nice okay I feel like I am list I
have like a huge list right now so try
to excuse my lips because I definitely
hear it I'm still kind of numb from the
dentist
oh my bad you guys it's you know it's
gonna look really funny with my lids
like really nice and even and then my
under eyes like under-eye circles on
fleek right now but we'll try to ignore
that and we'll fix that later so nice I
like it I like the color let's just see
how the eye shadow glides on top because
that's one of the reasons why I cannot
stand eye primers I know like some
people love it the only one that I can
do is from Mac the Paint Pots are really
really nice but for some reason I just
rather use concealer the palette that
I'm using today is from k'kaw it's the
k'kaw X Mario palette and I am very
excited to try it out it's very sleek
and chic it's all grey and I like how
the wording is like kind of shiny and
you open it up has a square mirror and
then there are 10 colors so I think like
initially I'm like the first color I
want to pick up is this one right here
this the first coat oh my god the first
color I want to pick up is this guy
right here in the middle and that is
going to be Miami right there so I'm
gonna take a fluffy brush and just start
to work that color on the crease i
swatched these on my hand and I can
definitely tell you that they're very
soft and pigmented so I'm really excited
to see how they perform on the eye I'm
just gonna do like a soft wash of this
color sky reminds me of bronzer or of
actually it kinda reminds me of caramel
which is really nice as a bronzer too so
I think that is a really nice bronzer
color as well I'm just gonna go back and
forth circular motions really blend that
in alrighty so for the next color I'm
gonna pick up it's gonna be this guy
right here this one is called Libra and
a weight is this wrong bronzy this can't
be bronzy I'm gonna say this is Libra
this is Albanian right here this reddish
brown shade and I'm gonna take that one
with the same brush I used for the
crease and just go right below it like
right in there instead of taking it and
all the way I'm just gonna leave it
right out here
I'm gonna let it hang out on the edge
right there and just buff it into the
skin really good I just want a hint of
this color you don't want it all the way
through the crease
because honestly I do that with a lot of
looks I love this color and I will use
it like every single day of my life so I
and I usually take it all the way
through the crease but here I just want
to keep it on the outer edge just to
give it a hint of this warm
reddish-brown but not too much like I
don't want it to overwhelm the entire
look though but it is a beautiful color
I love that and then I'm gonna go in
with the darkest Brown I'm starting with
the darkest shades first a dark matte
shades because the other like creamier
shimmery shades tend to just keep moving
on the eye you don't just kind of stay
put so I want to lock down where I want
the dimension where I want the depth on
my eye before I put on like the cool
color the next one we take is this one
right here I'm going to take that dark
brown and it's like a cool tone brown so
it's not warm like the other colors so
it'll give it like a different kind of a
look right into this outer V and I'm
going to extend it like right past the
brow bone like you see how that bone
ends right here I'm gonna take it above
that just to elongate the eye a little
bit and I'm gonna bring it all the way
in to the inner corner but as we go into
the eye I'm gonna lift my hand up a
little bit just so we can have less
pressure and a softer looking Brown I
want most of the drama to be on the
outside let the middle to the outer half
of the eye these shadows blend out
beautifully the next shade I'm gonna
take is this light shade right here and
I'm hoping this is the right shade this
is a decade this like very nice creamy
bone color I'm gonna take that with a
flat brush or the flattest brush I have
which is this guy over here it has a
little bit of glitter on it but we're
just gonna go with it and start to pop
this on the brow bone well that's a very
very pigmented sometimes I get so into
my mirror that I forget that I have this
huge screen in front of me and I'm just
like for the pop of color I definitely
feel like the blue is necessary even
though I see the same glue on a lot of
people but it's just because it stands
out
so much and it's such a beautiful color
you have to use this color so I
definitely see myself using this shade
later
and this one it's so beautiful but I'm
gonna go for it the blue on this one and
this one's called Albanian usually I
don't like putting color so close to my
inner part of my lid but I'm gonna do it
and I'm gonna see what it looks like
wish me luck mmm I just painted this on
my eyeball wow this is extremely
pigmented I could just it's like
literally like paint on the eye I'm
gonna take this tiny brush right here
it's the M 507 I'm gonna take more of
that Brown that darkest Brown that they
have in the palette and work that right
on top of the blue I'm gonna go ahead
and work the color down on the lower
lash line we take the brown the dark
brown let me go right underneath the
blue so we can tie the whole look
together and then for the inner corners
I'm going to take this gold color right
above the blue this one is glam I'm
gonna take that with a tiny little brush
and just pop it in the inner corner to
line my lash line I'm gonna do a wing
I'm gonna use the dose of colors shady
cream matte eye color and I'm gonna take
a wing liner brush and start to create
our wing so I'm going to start right
about halfway out and flick upwards
it'll be easier because we already
created the wing with the blue so we're
basically just defining it this is such
a creamy liner it literally just goes on
the skin so soft and smooth well my
wings are ready to fly right now they're
so long I haven't done a wing like this
in a very long time oh I'm gonna put
some mascara on really quick pop on some
new lashes the lashes I'm wearing today
are from Lily lashes and she is newly in
Sephora so this is for the Sephora
collection this is the style Rome okay
these lashes are so pretty like I
already know Lily lashes has one of the
best lashes out there but these lashes
are so so pretty like I can see myself
wearing these more than just one time
like I
want to wear these over and over again
for the rest of the face I have been
wanting to use this guy for a while
I just haven't came around to use it so
I'm finally here I'm around and we're
about to use her on my face this is the
Elizabeth Arden flawless finish mousse
makeup and I seen it on Instagram before
I thought it looks really really cool
but I've just been a little scared to
use it because they only gave me this is
from something they gave me in PR they
only gave me one shade and I just hope
it's my color and it's it's a mousse so
I'm not nervous about this but let's see
how it goes I don't know Melissa if you
guys know her on Instagram I really
don't know how she did this but she did
it and she made it look so cool and
flawless that work' and she put it on
her face like this
it's like mousse for your hair but for
your face I'm gonna work it with my
Beauty Blender I really hope this is my
shade it's it's literally like air
you're poppin air bubbles I'm really
hoping for just full coverage because
this is a very dramatic eye look
honestly in a route like the real world
I wouldn't be doing it on my face I just
want to put it on Instagram I just want
to do it okay so I'm gonna be honest
with you guys but I would put it like on
a mixing plate or a piece of paper or
just like any flat surface that you're
willing to throw away I would put it on
that or clean I'm not gonna lie it's
kind of cool to look at like it's kind
of cool to see it on Instagram and so it
is just like putting it on their face
like that well and it's cool to like
drag it around your face it's probably
like light to medium coverage because I
don't see this being full the concealer
that I'm using is from covergirl it's
called a vitalist healthy concealer ooh
oh it's one of those I'm not a fan of
honestly I just like I know I'm not a
fan one of these because I don't have
the patience for this what what is going
on here okay all the products is here
and then you got to get it way down here
but there's this huge gap but um yeah so
I don't see that it shows me like a
color so I'll just have it in the
description for you guys if there is one
but I'm gonna go ahead and take that ooh
okay I can tell it's already sheer
because my foundations a little shear I
was hoping for more coverage from this
guy but I can already tell by the brush
that it's not but I'm not gonna judge it
too much because we haven't blended it
in to the skin yet because I can feel
like this is a very light coverage
concealer I'm just gonna go extremely
light handed with this by like barely
paddock patting it so I can get the most
out of the concealer and it seems to be
doing okay but I feel like if I really
press down it's just gonna come off I
could be wrong I'm just scared I don't
want to take the risk all right so now
that my concealer is like still a little
damp I'm gonna take this new powder that
I haven't tried pray that there's no
flashback this is the Catrice nude
illusion loose powder transparent matte
so it looks like this it's very white
but it's not supposed to go off come off
on your skin like that so and just start
to Pat it right on top I'm gonna go
ahead and use the contour stick from
Milani this is the contour and highlight
cream and liquid duo and I have not used
Milani in a very long time so I'm very
excited I'm gonna go I know it's like a
little powdery here but we can still
contour so I'm gonna go in with a cream
contour this is a very natural color I'm
just gonna go right on the sides I'm
gonna go on the sides of the nose test
it out go across to get that little
turned-up button nose on the bottom just
like that start to work in the contour
up here the tip of this is very pointy
so I wish it was a little bit more
rounded but that's not a big problem or
issue I like the color this is the color
natural medium now we have a new nose
tada
now I'm gonna go on and take off this
powder I'm not gonna let it sit too long
today okay to be honest you guys the
concealer is just not enough coverage
for me I feel like I require a lot more
coverage for my under eye circles but it
may work for people that don't have such
deep under-eye circles so now I'm going
to go on to the bronzer this is a
bronzer that I haven't used in the lotty
tan time Brown
I use their blush which I really really
like so when I saw the bronzer I was
like yes let me see how this looks on my
face and temples oh my god this is
definitely going to pick up a lot of
product could be careful this is a nice
bronzer I definitely would use it again
I'm going on to blush this is a new
blush from Benefit it's called gold rush
I usually stay away from these types of
blushes such a beautiful pan like it
looks gorgeous but on my textured cheeks
I don't feel like this would look the
best
I wouldn't gravitate towards putting
this on my teeth but I don't want to
talk down on it before I use it because
it may be amazing and sometimes just
because it looks super shimmery in the
pan the shimmer is kind of like their
micro and they just kind of melt into
the skin so I'm hoping that this that's
what this does for me but let's see
let's test it out
it looks like the gold shimmer is kind
of lifts up pretty easy so it's probably
just something that just looks really
pretty in the pan but let's see oh it
smells so good I don't think that it
makes my texture look that bat like I'd
makes me uncomfortable to be honest to
put it on my cheeks but it also for one
if you don't have a lot of cheek texture
it's kind of like a blush slash
highlight all-in-one so even if you put
a little bit here just for a pinch of a
glow and like a little bit of flush this
would be really pretty I think it looks
good it's just me personally I wouldn't
gravitate towards this because I have
textured skin for the highlight I have
this from violet boss it's called
coconut cream pop it's a loose
highlighter I think I don't think
they've ever had loose highlighters so
I'm very interested to see how this is
gonna work the swatches are really
beautiful but let's just check it out
and see what it looks like on the cheeks
oh okay because I have the gold from the
blush and then I have this I feel like
oh my god I really like it it's really
really pretty I love this color I'm
gonna I'm just gonna use this really
quick this is not new it's okra Mac and
then this is something new that I
haven't used it's from Too Faced it's
their new natural lips but it's like new
packaging and some a new some of the new
shades this is a birthday suit which I'm
not sure they had before now I want to
try it because I don't think I've tried
it
that's really pretty kind of look
similar to the k'kaw one and then for
the lip gloss on top I'm gonna use this
one from urban decay it's called
midnight cowgirl ultra cushion lip gloss
and in that is the final look thank you

me a big thumbs up you guys know what to
