today I am doing this look right here
guys welcome back to my channel so today
I'm going to be doing this look right
here for you guys so pretty it's like a
subtle pop of color which the pink was
definitely something that I kind of made
up as I went I felt like this lip was so
bright I had to bring some pink into my
eyes after I did it I was like thank God
that things happen for a reason
everything happens for a reason it's so
different like it's a little bit out of
my comfort zone but at the same time
it's so wearable like I have too much
color on my eye I just feel like it
doesn't suit my face very well so this
is perfect for you girls that want to
add a pop of color into your look but
you don't want it to complete overwhelm
your face and everything that I'm using
in this video is totally new to me so
I'm using it for the first time with you
guys there is like one palette in here
that I've used before but everything
else is pretty much new foundation
concealer there's a ton of new products
that I just got and I'm just super
excited to share them with you guys and
how I feel about them and how they wear
and just how they look so if you want to
learn more about the new products that I
got and how to get this look then keep
watching so before we get into the
makeup I'm gonna use this skin serum
this is from instanatural it's an age
defying skin clearing serum from in my
Ipsy glam bag so I'm gonna try this out
for the first time on my face it's
supposed to help with like acne and
blemishes just to smooth out your skin
like Sara comes in this little droplet
I'm just gonna put it on rub that into
my skin to make sure that our foundation
last a long time we're going to use this
Chi face primer this is The Hangover are
at replenishing face primer I'm going to
go ahead and work that into my hand and
then just work it on my face okay I'm so
excited about these the foundation that
I'm using today is from Urban Decay look
at the packaging first of all how cool
is the packaging so cute and this is
supposed to be a waterproof long wear
full coverage matte finish oil-free
foundation I love my full coverage
foundations so let's see how
where's this is shade 6.0 it looks like
my skintone this is 7.0 so I'm going to
put this one on the side that's a little
more tan and I'm just gonna take my
black Beauty Blender I'm just gonna go
into both of them mix it I always do
this I always use my hand as like a
mixing plate there's always makeup all
over it so let's see how this goes on
our face see how this goes on our face
the most important thing when you're
trying to find the right foundation
shade for you is that it matches your
neck if it matches your neck it's gonna
it's going to be perfect for your entire
face it's definitely full coverage you
can obviously see the difference it's a
layer of new skin basically this is
totally totally full coverage which I
love I like to go all the way around my
neck very close to my hairline bringing
it down and around makes everything look
so flawless and even no red marks no
blemishes and get in the inner corners
so for concealer I'm going to be using
the Tarte shape tape concealer and it
looks like this I'm in light/medium so
I'm going to be using this to cover my
under eye circles and also using it as a
base highlight comes with this huge doe
foot applicator which I love I wish we
had more concealers with these huge
applicators because it just covers such
a large space
first of all how this is a really good
coverage Tarte always has the best full
coverage foundations concealers will
Urban Decay's concealer The Naked skin
has always been my favorite for the
longest time so them coming out with a
full coverage foundation doesn't
surprise me that it's going to be just
as good as a concealer art always same
thing they always come out with the best
full coverage foundations and now the
best full coverage concealer and it
blends out so nice and evenly it's just
so beautiful this isn't new on my
channel I have been using this quite
often but I'm going to just fill in my
brows this is the benefit precisely my
brow pencil I'm gonna do that off camera
I'll be right back and I'm gonna have a
new brow product to show you guys that I
haven't used on my channel so let me do
these eyebrows and I'll be right back
okay so I just drew on my eyebrows I
have eyebrows now I'm gonna try this 3d
brow tones this is in shade number two
what this does is it adds highlights to
your brows really interested to see how
my browser and a little highlighted so
I'm going to use this end you see how it
has this like spiky end I feel like most
of the product is right at the end of
the brush so I'm just gonna brush it
through Oh mm-hmm
I'm gonna blend it out and then I'm just
gonna work it through the brow probably
some in the front it does make it more
3d looking it gives it dimension I do
think a subtle hint of 3d brow towns is
nice for a little dimension but don't go
crazy with it
before I put my eyeshadow on I'm going
to use this BH Cosmetics waterproof eye
primer right here okay let's go on to
the shadow okay so for the shadow
okay this palette I've used several
times on my channel this is the neat
matrimony palette and I'm going to take
Matt Lopez right here and work that into
the crease
okay so I'm also going to take Matt
Lopez along the lower part of the lash
line just so that you guys know we're
doing the crease and the lower lash line
make sure you apply it as close to the
lashes as possible you don't want to
bring it down too far we just want to
balance out the crease and the lower
part of your eyes okay so I'm going to
take this gorgeous color from the BH
Cosmetics oil eyes eye shadow palette
and it's this one right here what I'm
going to do is I'm going to take some of
that foil eyeshadow that opera fiery
burning hot shade and apply it to my lid
so I'm just going to start right on the
inner corners by patting it down like in
quick patting motions all across the lid
a little past the crease and somewhat in
that hollow of your eye and just just
soften the edges of the foil shadow I'm
going to go ahead and go back into Matt
Lopez era and just blend it through so
that you don't have any harsh edges just
bringing it in right here
these shadows are so pigmented this is
actually my first time using BH
Cosmetics swear I know they've been on
YouTube for so long it's my first time
and I really like it so I'm going to try
out this Too Faced sketch marker it's
such cute packaging they have so many
different shades but I chose a black one
of course so I'm going to go ahead and
make my wing and let's try this guy up
first of all I can already tell it's
just so black it's dark it's so easy to
make that line you see how easy that was
like this is going to be my new favorite
I feel the vibes coming
so now I'm just going to go in with the
Thrive cosmetics
Infiniti waterproof eyeliner in Lauren
it comes with a little smudger brush at
the end so I'm going to smudge it out
afterwards I'm going to work it into my
waterline and then for the mascara I'm
going to use the Make Up For Ever
excessive lash mascara and then I'm
going to go ahead and apply some false
lashes so I'm going to do a little bit
of baking I'm going to use this banana
powder from a bellapierre
and I'm going to go ahead and do that
underneath my eyes gonna soften any fine
lines that you have and just smooth out
your pores and to apply it I'm going to
use this Revlon brush I'm going to pack
it on to my under eye and just leave it
for a few you got to be careful with
this though because if you put on too
much it can actually really hyper
intensely focus on all your fine lines
or even create lines that are not there
so be careful on how much you put on so
next I'm going to go ahead and contour
I'm going to use this BH Cosmetics
contour palette right here there's so
many shades you can use to contour your
face with in this palette it's insane
I'm also going to go ahead with this BH
Cosmetics 1-14 contour brush as she
shade right here mix it with this one
lightly contour my cheekbones right here
just a light contour and then I'm going
to go into this yellow apply this to the
area's I want to highlight like the
center of my forehead to bring light to
this area down my nose and to bronze up
my face just a little bit and add more
warmth to it I'm going to take this
shade right here and use it as a bronzer
add a little bit of this to my cheeks
bring it around the temples for the
blush I'm going to be using this BH
Cosmetics 10 color blush palette I'm
going to use this one right here I love
this little guy I feel like I'm going to
be throwing him in my purse for
everything just applies it so pretty
this is one of the new products that I
got from cover effects this is the
custom enhancer dropped and this is in
shade and moonlight very very pretty it
comes like this in a dropper and I'm
just going to squeeze them on the back
of my hand
blend it out and apply some to my cheek
bone with my finger so just right
here oh my God look how glowy this is a
little bit yeah sorry you guys have to
see this crusty looking nails so
disrespectful I feel like this is a very
nice saw highlight I just got this Marc
Jacobs blush in which feels so velvety
smooth and just really nice on your skin
I'm going to layer this blush on top of
this one kind of creating a gradient
effect on my cheek so I'm going to take
a little bit of this Marc Jacobs bronzer
in pink and kisses and blend it down it
glides on your skin so beautifully I
love this blush I was at the Marc Jacobs
event when I got this blush right here
and one of the Marc Jacobs makeup
artists was teaching us the draping
technique I think I've seen Wayne Goss
do a video on draping it's basic it's
basically it's basically contouring with
your blush so it's like bringing your
blush all the way around your temple on
top of your nose and just on your cheek
on your chin I don't want to try it on
camera right now because I feel like I
don't know how a pink blush as a contour
method would look right now so I'm gonna
try it off-camera probably on snapchat
if you don't follow me on snapchat you
can follow me right here I'm Kristin
snaps but I'm gonna try it and then I'll
see how it looks and then if it looks
good I'm gonna show you guys where my
lips I'm going to use this artist brush
not this one this one and it's just like
a circular brush and I'm just really
curious to see how this is gonna work on
my lips so I'm going to test it out I'm
gonna go ahead and try to Smashbox
lipstick in it's in the shade dream huge
sigh heard so many good things about
this lipstick I actually tried the boss
lipstick the Lilly Singh one and such a
beautiful color by the way and it felt
like there was nothing on my lip that's
when you know you have a really legit
liquid lipstick because you don't want
to feel like it's like cracking on your
lips or just really dry I'm going to
take this lip liner right here this is
from colour-pop in doe and I'm picking
it because it's a little bit more of an
orange e shade and I want my lips to
have that orange e undertone so I'm
going to go ahead and apply that first
and then I'm going to go ahead and take
some of this shade right here on my our
teeth brush artist
rtst Sarkis and start to work that on my
lip this is a perfect lip brush I
usually stay away from them just because
I don't feel like they're that helpful
on my lips I like that the end is like a
circular because it covers more lip
space and you can just apply it a lot
quicker and it's so soft there to tie
the look together I'm going to try
something a little different I'm going
to take this pink sketch liner from Too
Faced and just go underneath okay I need
to fix this nail right here isn't this a
pretty nail polish it's from trust-fund
beauty in case you guys are wondering so
some trust-fund Beauty I'm going to fix
this nail right now you know what I'm
gonna fix it right now on camera so the
next proxy I want to talk about is Ryoji
oh it's there curl charisma rice amino
and quinoa for his control gel I
currently do not have curls in my hair

so I am going to apply this to my
straight hair control the frizz ease
