attractive tears I think they're just so
easy hey guys welcome back to my channel
today is a super fun video we're gonna
be testing a full face of first
impressions new makeup that came in my
PR and we have a bunch of really good
stuff to test out we have the new have
the new Kylie collection right here I'm
so excited and we also have the Brett
mint X morphe highlighter palettes some
new full coverage concealers that may or
may not be taking over some of the ones
that are very popular right now we have
new lippies from Ellery and color pop we
have so many new things that I can't
wait to talk to you about so we are
gonna jump in and figure out if these
are really great or not if we should buy
them or if we shouldn't so if you want
to see how that this look right here
this like cotton candy storm looking I
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
and hit that notification bell so you
can be a part of the quad family and
without further ado let's get in to this
video start off with my foundation first
I'm gonna be using this one from Marc
Jacobs this is the new shameless
youthful look 24-hour foundation this
has a sunscreen SPF of 25 actually comes
with this brush I've tried using it with
a Beauty Blender but I feel like it
works best with a brush this is a light
to medium coverage and just playing
around with it I know for sure that this
is one of those daytime foundations that
are just nice to throw on when you're
just gonna be out and about throughout
the day and you just need something to
even out your skin tone so this is one
of those everyday type of foundation
there's about 29 different shades in the
range you can choose from I'm a little
bit more tan on my body which is not bad
I'm not mad at it but I really have to
work in this foundation because it's a
little bit lighter and I definitely
don't mind that this is more of a
daytime kind of coverage because during
the day I don't like to have super full
coverage I want my skin to breathe I
just wanted to look even and healthy
noticing a little bit of separation but
I think that's just my prime
so I'm just gonna try and work that in
so now my skin is even it looks good I'm
gonna go ahead and do my eye shadow and
I'm gonna be using the new storm
collection from Kylie this is the eye of
the storm palette which is the more
dramatic eye shadow palette looks like
so and then this one over here is called
calm before the storm and it has those
soft pastel colors that I absolutely
love I feel like this one is super
special in the palette because this is
Aquarius this is stormy zodiac and my
zodiac so we're kind of twinning and
it's just a really pretty pastel purple
color and I like how she matched the
colors with a shimmer which I would go
perfect right on the center of the lid
so love that she did that I'm gonna take
this shade right here and I'm gonna work
it all over the lid I'm gonna come over
to the calm before the storm palette and
I'm gonna take this shade right here
this really pretty pink and I'm gonna
work that into the crease I love the way
her shadows feel they're always so soft
and smooth with a slightly smaller brush
is the 231 luxe petit crease brush from
zoeva I'm gonna take the darker shade
like that gray mauve color in the
palette this one it right here and I'm
gonna work that right below the pink
shade just give it a nice contrast and
dimension I'm gonna elongate my eye just
a little bit further so I'm going to
take this gray shade and I'm gonna bring
it out to the end of the brow bone and
buff it out right there so this is gonna
be more of the dramatic end of the eye
so this is gonna be the storm and then
this is gonna be like the calm of the
storm a bunch of drama right in there I
like this you put in more of a cool tone
shade for a transition I feel like this
gray really will change what we're used
to because you know everybody loves all
of those cool warm tone shades but I
don't want to lose the pink so I'm going
back into the pink and going right above
it so I'm gonna go ahead and take the
darkest shade in the palette which is
this guy right here I'm gonna work that
on the outer corners of my eye
the darkest shade is actually not as
intense as you think it would be just
like a really nice gray color so what
I'm gonna do is take this cream shadow
right here this is super star and it is
so gorgeous swatched it really quick for
you guys it is so so pretty I'm gonna
work that right into the inner part of
the lid one thing about this is that it
does kind of break up in between you see
how there's like a space of nothing but
then there's shadow all around it and
I'm trying to stick it right in there
okay I would usually never do this but
the black in this palette has blue and
silvery looking flex or like violet
flecks in it so I'm gonna take this
because it is a lot more deeper than
this shade right here so I'm gonna take
that color and work it on the outer
corner just to add more intensity to it
just to deepen up the look a little bit
further I think keeping these darker
shades really low on the eye and making
sure you don't go up too high with them
is super important just starting really
low because if you go up too high you
can have this crazy messy black eye and
it's really hard to come back from so
try to keep your blacks low as low as
possible and gradually inch your way up
to where you think you you want it or
where you feel comfortable with it but
they blend out really nice and I like
that this dark color isn't super
shimmery overwhelming it's just those
light soft violet flecks are in there
but it's definitely still matte looking
which is really cool
the only thing is this glitter shadow is
getting really hard and kind of flaking
everywhere today I'm gonna use a shimmer
on my brow bone and something I never do
but we're going to change it up today
and
a little bit of a pop right here I'm
actually gonna take the same color and
work it into the inner corners too it's
just so so freakin pretty I love this
color actually I'm gonna work more of
the pink in I am kind of obsessed with
this pink it's just such a pretty soft
pink and they just nailed this pink to
the floor
it's so nice I don't know if I want a
wing I think this I look looks already
kind of winged out so all I need to add
really is just some fluffy dramatic lash
it will be good to go for the eyes
except of course the lower lash line so
we have a new concealer to play with
it's this one right here from Laura
Mercier it's called the flawless fusion
ultra long wear concealer it's supposed
to be hydrating and it's not supposed to
crease at all so we are about to test
that out right now and it comes in this
tube that is not like a circle it has
almost like an oval shape I love these
types of applicators I think they're
just so easy I just think they're so
easy to use so I'm gonna use that right
now on this darkness that I have going
on underneath my eye they claim to have
a blurring effect with these concealers
and non-drying both of those things are
huge pluses and I can't wait to see if
that's actually true because if it is we
could possibly have a new fave on our
hands
very exciting
and I also like to put concealer right
here personally looking in the mirror I
feel like it helps a lot if I just put a
line right under and sweep it back
towards my ear I just feel like it just
gives me a lifted effect because
naturally it just kind of turns
downwards so we want to lift that up
give ourself a little bit of a facelift
I doesn't feel it's like super
lightweight but I I mean it's not a
problem it does seem to dry down pretty
fast I would say this this actually does
feel a little tiny teensy bit stiff on
the skin after a while I'm gonna add
another layer right in here so I get
really dark in this area I do like the
coverage so far do feel like it's giving
me that like soft focus blur effect to
my skin okay I feel like I have to read
this to you guys because it would help
with how it feels on my skin right now
because it does say that it's still
super flexible it says 12 hours of high
performance we're powered by skin fusion
technology long wearing flexible
polymers fused to skin for wear that's
transfer sweat and humidity and water
resistant even though I can feel the
concealer on my skin I don't mind it
because it's blurring out my face and
it's brightening my under eyes and I
just definitely feel covered so I love
that I'm gonna go into a calm before the
storm and I'm gonna pick up this pink
and mix it in with this purple because I
just have to use Aquarius
we're just 20 right now like my tattoo
actually it's on this side so I should
be like this
and then I'm gonna go into the dark
grayish mauve color right here and work
that on the outer part of the lower
lashline to smoke everything out I'm
just gonna line a little bit right into
the outer corners right here with a
liner that is not new I contoured my
face snatched it up really quick and now
I'm gonna go ahead and put on some blush
this one is from bareMinerals it's the
gen nude blush in that peach though oh
my god that's such a cute name that
peach though like they gave me this huge
thing of all the blushes this caught my
attention really quick and that's
probably what I was thinking exactly at
that moment with all the cool toned
shades we have going on our eyes is a
really nice contrast it's warm peach
color
so I'm just gonna grab my brush right
here and work that into my cheeks I like
the peach color because it gives you a
flush and at the same time it's a warm
shade so it gives you somewhat of a
bronzing effects and I didn't put on any
bronzer I'm just gonna go straight for
the blush today I'm gonna bring it
around the temple coming in like so this
is the draping technique where you take
blush and you bring it around like it's
bronzer you don't get like a ton of
payoff right away it's very buildable
which is something that I like because
when I have too much pigment at one time
I feel like I cannot get back go back
from it and I have to work really hard
at taking it away so this is really nice
you just picks up the perfect amount
without going overboard so I like that
the next thing we're gonna get into is
highlight and for the highlight that I'm
going to use today I have the morphe
babe in paradise this is the highlighter
palette with Brett Minh rock it's his
collaboration and it is absolutely it's
absolutely studying I love that it has
that Hawaiian theme because you know
Brett Minh is from Hawaii and you open
it up and you have four really nice
sized highlights lightest over here all
the way to the darkest shade I'm gonna
go into vacation I'm gonna go into
vacation and I'm gonna pop that on first
but I think I'm gonna end up popping on
a little bit of get laid feeling the
vibes Oh
we just take a moment to appreciate the
blinding effect of this highlight right
now okay I'm gonna take my finger cuz
it's a little bit more precise take it
on the nose this is such a perfect color
for highlight I love it it's so so
pretty I take it on my Cupid's bow like
so so pretty
cest Wow for the lips I'm gonna go for a
gloss today in just the gloss because I
feel like the eyes are the main
attraction we feel like I've been
gravitating more towards glosses lately
the one that I'm using is from the
Ellery X color Pop Collaboration she
came out with a bunch of lippies I think
it's like formats two glosses and then a
lippy stick and a liner and they're all
really pretty colors very wearable for
any type of day or night she has red
Browns in there this nude gloss that is
perfect it was calling my name I had to
use it today this is the Neda gloss and
I'm going to pop it on and I like that
the gloss is super pigmented look at
that oh and it matches so perfect with
this look thank you guys for watching I
hope you enjoyed this video if you did
go ahead and give it a big thumbs up for
me
before I let you go I just want to
remind you guys don't judge a book by
it's cover
take a chance get to know them before
you judge them by their looks or judge
them by what other people say because
you really don't know until you truly
get to know that person and then you can
make your own judgement so just a little
piece of advice
before we move on with our lives that's
pretty much it I love you guys so much
and I will see you in the next video bye
