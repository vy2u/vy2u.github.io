dramatic let me let's try that again
oh hey guys welcome back to my channel
so today we are gonna be doing nothing
but new stuff we got in PR all the new
makeup is on my face right now I created
this really pretty look with it and I'm
so excited to show you we got some Kylie
some new YSL foundation I've never tried
to milk makeup but we're trying it today
NARS just came out with a new color in
their liquid blush Mac we have hourglass
the bomb we have all these new makeup
that I can't wait to show you and can't
wait to try on my face so if you want to
see how I get this look right here
mm-hmm
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
and hit that notification bell so you
can be a part of the quad family and
without further ado we're gonna get on
to its product that I got is from milk
makeup I have never tried anything from
milk before I know that's kind of weird
but this is my first time it's called a
luminous blur stick give that soft light
effect on your face
but I'm a little nervous about this
because it is it is definitely
illuminating so imagine putting that all
over my like pimples I'm actually
putting that all over my texture yeah I
don't know how I feel about that so I'm
gonna start off by putting it right on
the cheekbone and see where that takes
me so here we go I'm gonna put it on my
face we're gonna blur and illuminate but
the thing is I want to try it on my face
because what if it like blurs out the
texture it almost has like a powdery
feel to it but I'm gonna go ahead you
know I'm gonna keep this on my
highlighting spots
it almost looks dewy it doesn't it look
shimmery it just looks dewy which makes
me want to try it on my cheek area so
hopefully my face doesn't turn out too
crazy
what we are going to try it here I
really like the way it smells it smells
like a light has like a citrusy scent to
it it's mixed with something really warm
I don't know it's it smells really good
and it feels really nice on the skin so
I'm gonna go ahead and pick up my why
sell some new wise self foundations I
got in I'm so excited these are the
all-in-one glow foundations and this is
supposed to be a
do we make up with a natural medium
coverage so we're gonna try it out this
is the shady d40 is a yellow undertone
it's very tan I fake baked recently so
I'm gonna use this one has a little pump
on it I always love pumps or less mess
is the best so I'm gonna take that on my
handy dandy mixing plate
yep that's gonna match my neck wow this
smells so good like a soft rose kind of
scent it's so so pretty and it's it's
not really covering too much but let's
see if it's buildable I do like the way
it feels on the skin it has a light
plushy feel to it it does have like a
dewy kind of look to it
it's very glowy dewy so if you have a
oily skin you may not like this but I
really like it because I have a really
dry skin so I love it
I'm starting to get a little bit oily
right in my t-zone just a tiny bit but I
honestly don't mind it because again
I've always been dry my entire life so
I'm gonna take my second layer of
foundation I'm just trying to cover up
this spot right here
I really like that natural kind of glow
it gives you the coverage is in bad it
is very soft and natural feeling so I
like it but it is very kind of a wet
looking on the skin I'm gonna let that
dry down so to prime the eyes I never
use a primer I always like concealers I
really am NOT a primer fan for the eyes
but make up forevers just came out with
this step one skin equalizer lip and eye
primer which I'm excited to use because
I really love their primers for the face
just gonna take this guy it's also 24
hours so that's cool I'm gonna take some
of my finger like that just pop it all
over the lid that's interesting that
this is for your eye and lip so that
feels really good on the lips we got in
the Kylie blue honey palette this is it
right here she always has those tears
coming down which resembles the colors
inside of the palette so super exciting
here we go I'm gonna put that natural
shade I always do this with every video
I think I can even skip this part as you
guys
kind of know it if you watch my videos
by now set it in place but does it move
around anywhere it's a nice pink
undertone to it which I like okay what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start off with
this guy down here I'm gonna say this is
honestly I'm always confused with the
way that they're flipped so I'm gonna
say that this is busy bee work it all
over the lid up into the crease just all
over the place all in the crease and I'm
gonna kind of work it you're usually
supposed to use a flat brush for your
lid but I'm just gonna use this brush
and go back because I just want to wash
up this color around the eye I'm gonna
really focus on that funny shade I think
that's gonna be really pretty with brown
eyes this almost reminds me of like a
melon color or like the background so
after that then I'm gonna go in with a
flat brush so that we can lay this color
down it's so pretty
this is sweet like honey I'm gonna take
this guy right here
and I'm gonna use a flat brush for this
as a zoeva 234 and I'm just gonna place
that all over the lid and I just feel
like it's going to bring out brown eyes
so beautifully so I'm just gonna work
that all over and then go in with a new
clean brush just to diffuse the edges
and then I'm just gonna go around the
edges of the honey color and pop on busy
bee or honey mood take that brown and
just go right around that crease and
just darken everything up I'm gonna take
that golden oil
I think it's royal jelly
okay before we get down to the lower
lashline I'm just gonna pop on some
concealer this I just got in PR this is
the Mac waterproof running water weight
concealer and this is in the shape and
c20 so I'm going to take this out it
looks like a dropper like that wow I did
not expect the coverage to be that great
because it says water weight maybe
because it doesn't feel heavy on the
skin for my concealer dries I'm just
going to set it with the laura mercier
setting powder which is definitely not
new and do that
so I'm gonna go back into the Kiley
palette I'm going to use this blue shade
right on the bottom it's like a green
green color actually and I'm just gonna
use it right on the lower lash line for
a pop of color I'm going to take a clean
pencil brush and just go right
underneath we wind it up I'm gonna take
a tiny bit of this color right here I'm
just gonna work it right underneath the
blue we can have that cool 3d kind of
look on the lower lash line it's not too
flat this is from the balm it's called
mr. right and it's in the shade see more
date nights have the cutest names for
their products and I'm just gonna hold
down just a tiny bit with my nail and
make sure that this waterline looks nice
and bright it's gonna keep our eyes open
if you have smaller eyes and you're
using a dark color around them you can
definitely use this trick to keep your
eyes wide open this is from hourglass
they have a new eyebrow pencil it's
called arch it's the brow sculpting
pencil one side has a it's fully on it
the other side is just this little
triangular shape right here this is in
dark brunette so I'm just gonna work
that into the sparse areas of my brow
and then when I want to fill them in
I'll just lay it flat down and it'll
fill in a larger space brows are filled
in I actually really really like the new
hourglass arch pencil it's not too light
to where you really have to work your
pencil back and forth but it's not too
dark to where you have to be scared to
put your pencil down so it's right it's
like a happy medium right in the middle
and it just I love it I definitely I'm
traveling I'm actually going to New York
tomorrow putting this in my makeup bag a
for sure we're gonna need some bigger
lashes so I'll be right back because
these are the velour lashes and
serendipity so just you know pop them on
really quick and I will be right back
with lashes and we're gonna do the rest
of the face okay I'm back with the
lashes I know I'm just going to wipe off
the extra powder I think it's really
settled into my skin at this point for
blush I'm gonna take the NARS liquid
blush in hot Knight Hot Tin room took me
a really long time to try to say that
then you start to work it into my job
okay that is very intense I do not
suggest you do that so take the tiniest
tiniest amount
work it in your vase but we are gonna
we're gonna work through this so I'm
gonna take the cleans out of my beauty
blender then just start to work it back
into the hairline and you can actually
diffuse this so don't be too scared if
you if this happens to you you just go
on the clean side of your beauty blender
and you keep twisting it until you've
used each clean inch of your Beauty
Blender instead I'm gonna take it all
the way up into the temple and actually
gonna use the rest of this right in here
using a little bit of red like this does
kind of give you that and I've got a
little bit of a burn from the Sun um it
gives you some color it gives you like a
nice fresh kind of look I don't have
anything new to contour wet so I'm gonna
do that off camera and I will be back
with the next new the mary-lou manizer
it's the liquid mary lou manizer it's a
all-over highlight in a tube like this
like so and I'm just gonna make a little
tiny mark right there right on the
cheeks and then I'm gonna do right
across the nose down the nose right on
the Cupid's bow this is a very
natural-looking highlight I'm just gonna
take the Ofra pillow top right on top of
it I just got this in I've actually
never tried pillow talk I don't know if
it's new or not but I've never tried it
so I'm gonna use it in this video right
on top of the mary lou manizer or lit
mary and doom and I was let's call it
Larry I'm gonna take this brush right
here from the makeup shock it's a 243
brush and some of pillow talk and then
we're just gonna pop it on right on top
it's got this in from colour-pop it says
colour-pop lux and it is a whole package
full of their new lipsticks and they're
so so cute and they have so many
different shades so I'm gonna choose a
shade right now and let me just show you
up close okay so this is the packaging
has little stars on the top and this is
color pop so whenever you twist up the
lipstick you have all of these really
cute little stars imprinted all over the
top I just love when brands do this
little stuff it's so so cute so I'm
gonna go ahead and take a lil ad on the
lips
okay the next thing I got in from my PR
packages is this Mac mineralized charge
water charged water charcoal spray and
I'm going to just set everything in with
this spray really quick so here we go
