call my name hey guys welcome back to my
channel as today I'm going to be doing a
full face of first impressions using
everything that's new from PR packages
in some stuff that I just just got and
I'm lead on it one of the hugest things
is like highly lip kissed the packaging
is beautiful on this there are so many
good things that I got I got a whole
bunch of new stuff and I can't wait to
show you guys I created this look with
it and I really really like it so also I
have currently been obsessed with
musically I might be really late I only
have a video of my uncle doing jeju on
that meet which originally was not it
was like a Spanish song but he was
dancing sooo and then I we changed it
one day I will have the Rolex challenge
on there I even practicing before you go
and watch this video make sure to
subscribe to my channel and also take
the bail so you can be a part of the
quad family so if you want to learn how
to get this look right here then keep
watching first thing I'm going to talk
about is that are these are Solley drops
I haven't tried them I feel like I've
seen in thousands of times on Instagram
but I haven't tried them personally all
I know is that they are so gorgeous
these if you look at it there's both
flecks it's infused with 24 karat gold
look at that now you're gorgeous
I just want to do it up close and iris
evil will do this so I'm going to try it
try it out I'm crying gold tears
somebody help me into glams I'm going to
put that all over my face the smell is
really nice too the dry oil so it just
sinks right into your skin so quick this
is from glam glow right here it's the
nude glow shade and it's an illuminating
moisturizer it looks like so and then
it's so pretty
everything we're using today it has some
kind of gold in it some kind of glam in
it so if you have really nice flawless
skin and you are don't feel like wearing
makeup I would put it all over my face
or anywhere I want to highlight but if
you don't I would be very careful on
where you put this I would have put it
all over my face because all my pores
will be highlighted all my blemishes it
just would not look cute for me so I'm
just going to put this on as a point of
my face where I want a high
this is going to be the base highlight
basically I'm going to go underneath my
I think it's a really nice to use around
your eyes because it is very
moisturizing and your eye has very
delicate since skin around it so I'm all
about moisturizing that area and if it's
illuminating even better because
sometimes it can look a little dull okay
so next I'm going to move on to the
foundation for foundation I got this
Bobbi Brown Foundation is kind of watery
I hope I'm praying that the coverage is
good because it does seem like very
light let's see let's see how this goes
also I just literally got this in today
this morning from Beauty Blender this is
part of their summer fling collection
this is the neon green one they also
have a neon pink and an orange one
they're super cute and I'm not filming
I'm just doing my makeup on myself I
don't even do foundation first I go
straight for the brows I don't like it
to feel really around them because then
I feel like the product doesn't grip to
the brow areas as easy it's kind of
slippery and sliding so I'm trying to
stay away from that area if you have
nice flawless skin this foundation is
going to be great for you I can still
see my skin which is not a bad thing but
I definitely feel like I need more
coverage so I'd probably grab concealer
and put it over this to be on it now I'm
going to go ahead and move on to my
brows now I bought this makeup forever
brow kit is I've never tried anything
from makeup forever for my brows so I'm
really interested to see how this is
going to work I have two shades that I
think will work for me this is number
forty and this is number number or fifty
so I'm thinking I'm going to use this
towards the middle part of my brows and
this on the end so I'm going to go ahead
and start right here where it's very
sparse and just go back and forth and I
just like to sketch my brows on like
that it gives your browser most
imperfect perfect one I know sometimes I
like when my brows look really nice and
sharp but then other times I've been
really liking the way it looks by
sketching them on like this it's just
quicker and it gives you a more natural
look if you're going for that I'm
picking up the nen 50 because I just
need I need a little bit
more coverage right in here it's one of
those pencils that you can sharpen and
sharpen and sharpen and it's going to
last you forever so I don't mind that I
wish there was like an in-between that
would be perfect for my entire brow the
next thing I'm going to try this new is
its their brow gel and this is in the
shade 35 it's a little bit lighter so
it's going to soften up the darkness
just make it look a little bit more
natural so the bristles at the top are
pretty long and then are the rest around
the rest of the brush they're really
short I'm going to use the longer
bristle for the tail so we can shape the
little hairs well I kind of like it like
this because it's not giving you a ton
of product at one time it's kind of like
slowly working it through and then if
you want more product you can flip it on
the short bristle side and it'll still
comb it through but it will deposit a
lot more product I really like the way
it softened it up between the two colors
and then this brow gel it really made my
brow really nice and soft but if you
have to go out and buy that many
products to get a nice brow I wouldn't
do it personally I have it in front of
me and they're sending it to me so
that's why I'm doing it but if I had to
go out and buy them any products I
personally wouldn't so it's up to you
guys I think they work really well it's
just the colors are a little bit off to
me you have to buy a few products to get
the perfect looking color okay so now
we're going to move on to the eyes I'm
going to prime my eyes first before I
get into them so actually I'm going to
use some concealer to do that this isn't
a new concealer this is from Kat Von D
it's the locket concealer let's just
cover up those under eye circles real
quick
now I'm going to get an eye shadow I'm
going to be using this new little MAC
eyeshadow that just came out it's called
oh my banana it's so cute it's like
fruity and colorful it's so pretty these
are the shades that are inside someone
go ahead and take this 229 brush right
here from Luxy and I'm going to go into
that taupe shade and let's start to work
that into my crease to add some def I'm
going to go back and forth in windshield
wiper motion I like that this palette
has this matte taupe shade in it I feel
like it's a really nice shade and I'm
think I'm going to just go into the next
matte color in this palette which is
this plum shade right here this one
please ignore my nails I'm trying to
grow them back and they keep peeling off
every time every few days they just peel
off they just fall off randomly please
ignore my nails I just want them to be
healthy again so I can put more
coffin-shaped nails on them that's all I
want to do I just want to have glam
nails again and I'm going to take this
231 from luck see it's a small tapered
blending brush so I'm going to go ahead
and work that right into the crease I'm
going to keep it pretty light towards
the inner part of the crease or the
inner third and then I'm going to really
intensify the outer part of the crease
and I'm kind of working between both
brushes so I'm building it up blending
it out and then building it up running
it out so there's no harsh edges if you
feel like you lost some of that crease
shade that taupe shade I'm going to go
ahead and go back into it I feel like
I've kind of lost it so I'm going to
bring it right back in there you still
want that bronzy glow around your eyes I
think this is going to be a really
pretty look so this summer I haven't
used a dark shade on my lid in a really
long time so I'm going to go in with the
taupe on my lid haven't done this in a
while we're doing it
we have it on the crease and now we have
it on the lid we there's no turning back
now gotta keep going I'm going to Pat it
on there it was just calling my name
honestly I was just screaming
now that we have the taupe on the eyelid
I feel like I need to go back into the
purple deepen it up some more
and add a little bit more of a heavier
hand here okay with the same brush I'm
going to take that plum color right here
then go right on the outer lower lash
line keeping it away from the taupe
shade because you want it to peek
through and we want it to be a nice
gradient I'm actually going to bring
this small detail brush up around the
crease because I want it to be a little
bit more intense and this is not giving
me that intensity and then because it's
so small it's not going to really blend
very well so I'm going to take my
blending brush right here and just go
around it try to blend it further away
so it kind of smoothes in to the taupe
shade push your brush down on your skin
too hard otherwise your eyeshadows in
and come out hard I'm going to take this
shade right here and I'm going to pop
that down on the lower lash line as well
I'm going to go with the same brush and
work it really close to the lash line
I'm not going to go too far and with
this keep it right on the outer part and
then I'm just going to flip this bottom
liner out a bottom shadow out I'm gonna
flick it upwards towards the tail end of
the brow I'm also going to take that
orange shade in the palette and pop it
onto the inner corners so I'm going to
take this shade right here I just it's
calling my name it's so gorgeous I'm
going to take this and pop it on the
center part of my lid and it's actually
really creamy feeling and then I'm just
going to take this color pop pressed
powder this is out a lot I'm just going
to pop that on to my brow bone right
quick I just needed a nice matte shade
this is actually the first one I've ever
used it's kind of as a pinky undertone
to it okay so now I'm going to add this
purple this is from Milani it's the
stay-put waterproof eyeliner in the
fixed on plump I'm going to pop that on
the lower lash line and take it all the
way through actually the waterline in my
bad I'm going to use this Mac liquid
liner I don't know if this was new or
not you don't think it is going to
create a wing with this little guy so
I'm trying out the Buddha Beauty lashes
for the first time
I'm so excited the packaging with her
eyes on the lashes it's absolutely
stunning her face is gorgeous and I am
going to be wearing the fara number 12
my first thought on these lashes is that
there the band is really thick which
means you can use this lash over and
over again I'd say maybe about 10 times
or until they follow I'm going to go
ahead and pop these on to my eyes I
actually just got this L'Oreal
voluminous original mascara in and it's
a royal blue shade so I wanted to try it
out in this video it's really pretty and
I just I don't know I don't know how
it's going to look with the look but I
think it's really gorgeous and I think
we need to pop this on the lower lashes
just a little tiny bit to give it a
little bit of a pop so it's like
highlighting your hair blue a little bit
ok so now we're going to move on to the
highlight this is a new highlight from
Tarte it's the TARDIS Pro glow in the
shade Sparkle err I'm going to use that
right on top of my cheekbones I would
say gives you a nice medium glow it's
not like super intense see myself
wearing this like on an everyday basis
it's not blinding but we want it to be
blinding today so I'm going to go in
with this violet Voss loads old
highlight palette that I just got in and
it is so gorgeous the palette is covered
in pink roses which are my favorite
roses Ceasar when you open the palette
there's these huge square pans with all
the rose gold highlights in the
different shades so I'm going to take
Fleur and petal and work that onto my
cheekbones I have a nice amount of pink
and gold in there it's just really
really pretty then I just got this in
from Estee Lauder this is a part of the
bronze goddess collection which is so it
smells amazing and they also have this
dry oil they can spray on your body that
has these gold flecks in it gorgeous so
I definitely wanted to try B matte
bronzer I'm all about my matte bronzers
and the heat the pan is absolutely huge
this one has like an orange undertone
which most people don't go for I
actually like a little bit of an orange
undertone because I feel like it makes
me look just glowy like sunkissed now
I'm just going to set the creams in
place with a little bit of powder
underneath the eyes and around the
t-zone area okay for the lips I have a
new lip liner from colour-pop it's
called I am yours looks like this is a
pretty nude color for the grand finale
the k'kaw Kylie cosmetics cream liquid
lipstick oh my gosh I was dying when I
saw these these are so so pretty I'm
going to go ahead and eat Kimberly I
feel like I just want to mix all of them
together they're all almost very similar
now I'm putting Kim on to make my powder
look like skin I'm going to spritz on
this mac fix+
in coconut its it smells so good I feel
like this is going to be my new favorite
fix+
whenever I solve this and my PR packages
I was like I love fix+ today so let's go
ahead and spritz it on if you don't like
coconut you're not going to like this
but just the colorful fruits and the
coconut smell take you somewhere it
takes you to a tropical island ally and
