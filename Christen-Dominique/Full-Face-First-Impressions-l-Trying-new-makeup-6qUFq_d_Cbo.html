don't forget to subscribe to my channel
and hit that notification bell so you
can be a part of it squad family and
without further ado let's get over to
the new foundation from the balm is
called even steven it's a whipped
foundation in this little tiny jar I
have a light medium one and a medium so
I'm going to go between the two I'm
gonna start off with light medium and
then see how this is looking on my face
and if it doesn't work out I'm going to
switch to this guy so it looks like this
it's a wit foundation it is I don't like
anything I have to dunk my anything in
this doesn't seem right we're gonna see
how it applies on the face
so here we go it's a little cakey
looking and it might be a little too
light for me that is way too light for
my face okay I had to take that off I
was looking super pale and I'm going to
go ahead and apply the medium shade on
with my finger I think that'll be a
little bit better so let's with like
this automatically it is
drawing extremely mad it feels like this
foundation just sits right on the top of
your skin it doesn't sink into your skin
it just sits there on top it's like the
medium is a little too dark and then the
light is way too light so you would have
to get both of them just kind of to kind
of mix it up to get your shade and I
just I don't know if I how I feel about
the way this dries this dries super
matte I'm going to mix in some of the
light if you have dry skin this isn't
going to be a good foundation for you
because it's going to really accentuate
any lines that you have yeah I am not
feeling this foundation you guys used to
be honest I like other things from the
balm but this is just not one of them
I'm gonna go ahead and move on to the
concealer which is not a first
impression I can oldie but goodie this
is the Mac Pro Longwear it's gonna
brighten my under eyes and highlight a
little bit and then you will move on to
the next first impression I'm very
excited about this I even have some of
these guys go ahead and go into the heat
vibe I am going to be doing my eyes
using the urban decay and naked heat
pallet I'm very excited about it this
palette is so gorgeous my naked were
super popular they're all very cool
tones this one is on another level this
is an everyday palette for me I loved
every single shade in this palette and
I'm very excited to use it start off
with a low-blower this shade right here
working on the inner and outer corners
of the lid just patting it in and then
following up through the crease and then
with the brush from the Naked palette
I'm just going to diffuse the edges and
that's going to be our first transition
color I'm going to bring it up a little
bit past the crease just to add some
more drama to the eye
I usually like to keep darker shades
away from the inner corners but with
this look we're going to go in with use
dark shades so you want to change the
look up a little bit for the next color
I'm going to take key double right here
this matte shade right here same brush
just using the other side and I'm going
to work that right on top you always
want to keep that first color peeking
through I really like this the side of
the brush
that it comes with for blending it works
really good it just grabs the color and
it moves it exactly where you want it so
what I'm going to do is take a larger
fluffier brush to really soften the
edges I believe that center part of your
eye nice and open
okay now I'm going to make Cayenne and
sway go together build up that deep
intensity I think all these colours
going to work great together really
deepening up the inner and outer corners
it's gonna look like a fiery hot cheeto
honestly you guys when I get lazy and
I'm like I hope you're like taking
forever to blend my eyeshadow I just
pack it on it looks messy and then I go
in and blend it and that's where I do
all the work now I'm going to smooth
everything out with this larger fluffy
brush y'all are not ready for this xxx
hot shoot I'm taking my eye shadow a
little bit further out than normal and a
bug bit me right here so I want to cover
it up
well likely this looks because it's like
the purple in the Reds are not exactly
in the same exact place which is what I
like about it is kind of just marbled
everywhere so for the center I'm going
to take this super gorgeous color right
here called moon but it's such a pretty
color look at it I'm going to pop this
gorgeous color right onto the center of
my lid I didn't realized how red this
was going to be so I'm going to go ahead
and take more of that purple on the end
it's the matte purple right here it's
called ashes I'm just going to take that
a little bit more in fist and just work
it into the outer corners I just cleaned
up a side I feel like it was going a
little bit too low so I cleaned it up
made it into an angle and then I'm just
going to soften up the edges a little
bit on the outer corners I'm going to
take this makeup Shakti 11 brush and
just fluff I'll buff out edges right
here find a good girl blend apply a blue
mini blend by the brow bone I'm going to
take chaser right here and pop that on
to the brow bone and I'm using a city
color brush if you guys are wondering
what the heck this thing is right here
this is in a mosquito bite that is
making my eye shadow look deformed we
are going to fix that with the brow
don't highlight I want you guys to look
at your brow bone highlight as a second
chance you're having a bad eyes shadow
day your brother and highlight got you
girl
this is the L'Oreal luminous lash
paradise to coat the lashes I want a
little bit more of a pop on the center
I'm going to go back into the palette
and then it takes the lightest shade
it's called one set I think I'm just
gonna dot a little bit in the center
just to have that extra pop pop of light
there's these two liners that came with
a palette that came with the PR that I
got from Urban Decay a brown pencil and
torch and then this plum one in alkaline
please alkaline tough to line the top
and just run a line right across okay so
I'm going to go ahead and pop on the
lashes before we move on anywhere else I
need to feel the glam right now so I
just wrap these lashes these are the new
ones from house of lashes my dryers on
also these are the Elora light I thought
these would look really cute with this
look so I'm gonna go ahead and pop these
on really quick
usually just pop them on let me just see
they would look like I think they look
really good yeah they're cute they're
not too crazy there's still spikey force
all right so my lashes are on they have
just enough volume to make the look
complete so I'm gonna go ahead and start
on the lower lash line I'm going to take
cayenne and then start to work that on
the lower lash line bring that in like
this on both sides leaving a little
space in the middle because we want to
pop that highlight in the center and now
I'm going to go into n Fuego and I'm
going to work that right on the lower
lash line as well here to keep it really
close to those lashes and then I'm going
to take the purple and I'm also going to
pop it onto the lower lash line now I'm
going to take B mascara and I'm going to
work it into those bottom lashes alright
so that is it for the eyes
they are dramatic they are out there and
I am loving it this isn't something new
this is not a first impressions my kat
von d palette I'm just going to pop this
underneath my eyes so we can seal that
in place and brighten it up I'm a zero
go to contouring with some powder
contour this time so I'm just going to
go right underneath the cheekbone with
this the weaver brush right here alright
pick that and I was in shape so now I'm
going to put on a bronzer bronzer that I
have been loving a lot that I don't I
don't have a new bronzer to show you
guys but this one I have been loving so
much this is the Estee Lauder bronze
goddess so good so I'm just going to pop
that on to add some warmth to my face to
give my face in color so Kat Von D has
her new blush a Lolita is like hot it's
the hottest liquid lips that she has
it's very popular and now she has it in
blush form and a lipstick fork a matte
blush I always get excited from that
thing so I like to start at the hairline
and then bring it up upwards I want to
make this a very warm look so this color
is going to go perfectly this is a very
pigmented blush I barely have any on my
brush and it's just coloring in my cheek
bone like crazy I'm really liking it
still in it oh my god I do have a new
highlight but they broke when they came
in so I'm so sad about it but I'm going
to try it so we're going to try it i
swatched it on my hand on insta stories
and it was like so beautiful so I
definitely have to try this highlight
this is see new urban decay afterglow
highlighting palette mind is a little
broken these are the shades they're so
gorgeous I'm going to take side piece
and then pop it on to my cheeks oh my
goodness I'm sorry but the last time or
Nicki came out with their highlight like
a highlighter or a looot an illuminator
I didn't like it I feel like it was
chalky and it didn't stick on to the
skin it wasn't highlighting anything
this is another level like this is a
beautiful highlight I am so in love with
this highlight I'm going to put some
actually on my nose right there right
here in right
the packaging - is so gorgeous look at
that Lancome came out with some new
juicy shakers I actually never tried the
juicy shakers they do the juicy shakers
on my channel I tried them off my
channel I tried them I wasn't a big fan
of them to be honest so I didn't really
want to use them on my video because I
was in a fan of them but these came out
the juicy the matte juicy shaker's so
I'm excited to try it just shake it up
looks like this it's a cute little
little guy like that this is in the
shade beige vintage it also came with
some nude lip liners so first I'm going
to line my lips I'm going to take XI
Arab berry this guy I'm gonna line my
lips so we're all filled in now I'm
going to go ahead and take the jutsu
shaker shake it up and then I'm gonna
put it on my lips so it's not like
anything special mm-hmm it feels really
good on the lips it's very plushy it
just feels like it feels really wet this
is to try and match so let's see what
this dries like this is actually a lot
thinner than what I thought it would be
I really like this applicator it feels
so good for the lips it's like so
squishy this is a fiery look I love this
blood right I popped on some contact
these are the Desio
grey rebel contacts and I think it
changed up the look a little bit and I
like the way it looks I kind of look
like vampirish but I like it like in a
good way
I'm going to go ahead and pose now
