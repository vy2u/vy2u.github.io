just can't get over this glow hey guys
welcome back to my channel since today
we are doing a full face of makeup under
five dollars not gonna lie this is a
little tricky I thought I had a lot of
it most of it but I actually didn't so I
had to go to the store and do some
hunting for five dollar makeup that
means everything on my face from
concealer foundation eyeshadows lashes
liner every single things that you see
up the glow oh can we just talk about
that below everything on my face is
under five dollars which is amazing and
is why one of the reasons I'm super
excited to show you this video because I
definitely found some amazing balm
products that I can't believe are only
five dollars and under it's giving me
like bronzy summertime spring vibes so
if you want to see how I got this look
right here then keep watching but before
you go don't forget to subscribe to my
channel and hit that notification bell
so you can be a part of the quad family
and without further ado let's get on
with the video and start off with face
primer first so I'm gonna take this wet
and wild dewy Lumino photo focus face
primer from Wet n Wild and it looks like
it has a little bit of a color to it
hmmm okay so we are going to apply that
and it's very shimmery looks really
pretty like a almost like a highlight
I'm gonna work that into my skin all
over we're gonna have obviously we're
gonna be glowing this is really glowy I
feel like this could be a base highlight
I don't know about putting this all over
my face but we're just gonna do it
alright we are glowing we're gonna be
extra glowy today it's insanely shimmery
my face looks like The Tin Man and then
for a foundation I'm going to take this
wet-and-wild coverall cream foundation
is supposed to be full coverage like
medium to full coverage lightweight
satin matte finish all-day wear
let's see if this is a really full
coverage when Wilde has some really
affordable products that are actually
good so I'm really interested to see if
this foundation is gonna work for me I
thought this color was gonna be way off
for me but it actually looks pretty good
so far my coverage isn't too bad
while I'm here I'm just gonna put this
on my eyelid to even out the skin right
here
I like the coverage that it's giving me
so far all right so for the brows I have
this catrice eyebrow pencil in the shade
don't let me Brown get it s cute even if
you accidentally pressed down this
pencil is very forgiving and it's not
too waxy or thick okay not gonna lie my
brows are actually a little bit lighter
than what I like them to be on the outer
part of my eye but that's okay I'm gonna
leave it how it is and move on to the
eyes for the eye shadow I did not
realize that the color pop press shadows
individually are five dollars each so I
put them all in this Z palette that I
have so I'm gonna choose from these guys
right here I've never tried their
pressed powder so I'm really excited to
see how it's going to perform on my eye
especially because it's only five
dollars and we already know that color
pops pretty pigmented and they have
really cool products so I'm excited to
see if they're pressed shadows are as
good as those super shocked ones so I'm
gonna take this guy right here this is
hear me out my goodness these guys are
super pigmented woah oh my gosh
but I'm gonna take a different brush I
think that's gonna help I'm gonna take
Firefly and I'm gonna take hear me out
together and just use that all over the
lid to set to set the eyes and honestly
this is so pigmented and I'm having a
little trouble blending out right in
here but I think that's probably a
foundation issue going in to these two
guys right
I like that these are pigmented but I
feel like they don't move around as easy
that was a little brighter than what I
expected but that's okay for the crease
I'm gonna go in with these three shades
right here this is wake-up call bel-air
and made to last I'm just gonna take all
of them and start to work them right in
the crease you guys these shadows are
very pigmented I'm gonna go back into
the shade the brush that we used earlier
blend this guy out these are a little
hard to blend they're just means you
have to blend all right so next I'm
going to go in with paper tiger and note
to self go back and forth in between
those and just start to work that on the
outer part of the lid and going up into
the crease and then I'm taking it all
the way like I'm moving my brush towards
the tail end of my brow bone just cuz I
want to elongate my eye a little bit I'm
gonna keep it away from the front part
of my eye so next color I'm going into
is this brown shade right here this is
top notch this like reddish rustic Brown
I'm gonna go in with a smaller brush and
take that on the outer portion I just
working in all these brown shades so
that we can create this beautiful
gradient in our eye I'm gonna take this
fluffier brush and just buff everything
out make sure that everything is smooth
there's no harshness or rough edges so
I'm gonna go into cloud 9 this is a
really dark brown matte shade right here
and I'm gonna take that on the outer
corner of you always want to start off
with just a little bit of dark color tap
off the excess like crazy and then go in
and blend it out not completely but just
soften it soften the edges around it
keep adding more but gradually do that
don't just put on a ton of dark
eyeshadow in one spot because then it's
really hard to go back from that it's
hard to move around and it could get
really big and messy so just leave it in
one little tiny spot and work the
intensity level up as you go and I'm
doing this little short rolling motions
right here and then it just in case we
lost some of that brown orange shade I'm
just gonna take that and paper tiger mix
them together on this outer portion of
that eye and keep along dating the eye
well for me I like to elongate the eye
so it's gonna take some and keep working
it out here giving it more of a wider
effect and then bring it in like this
right above all of the shades for the
bottom I'm just gonna take paper tiger
and top notch I'm gonna mix these two
guys together to make my own little
unique shade and work that on the lower
lash line bringing it all the way in to
the inner corner okay and then I go into
a boxer which is this really pretty
coppery Brown golden bronze II looking
shade and work that on the lid
alright so for the very inner corners
I'm gonna take this beautiful beautiful
shade this is save it for later and I'm
gonna take this little brush and work
that right now I'm just gonna hit my
brow bone really really quick hear me
out which is kind of bright but we'll
make it work I'm just gonna go back and
forth okay so this is the essence
superfine eyeliner pen I want this wing
to just kind of come out of my own
eyeball so I don't want to bring it all
the way in I don't want this in her area
to get really thick I just want it to
literally just this eyeliner is so good
it's so so dark and pigmented now I
don't know how long until this guy is
gonna dry out completely on me because
that kind of happens with more
inexpensive eyeliners but from a first
impression just putting it on my eye
next I'm going on to mascara mascara is
a mascara so I'm just gonna pop
ask her on from ELF I don't know if it's
gonna be good or not but we're just
gonna put eyelashes on anyways I'm gonna
take the ascent extreme last gene easy
glide waterproof eye pencil called silky
nude and I'm just gonna put that on my
waterline so these lashes that I'm using
right here are from ELF these are the
winged and bold lashes these are very
natural-looking alright so that is it
for the eyes I like how they're just
bright and kind of doughy eyed and
winged out that's really really pretty
this could definitely be a daytime or a
nighttime look I feel I can go either
way like daytime blam or just like light
night makeup this is the LA girl Pro
conceal it's as a yellow corrector and
you guys know how I love my yellow
corrector so I'm gonna take that right
underneath my eye if you have really
dark under-eye circles or if you haven't
gotten sleep in a little bit or you're
like a student you're just studying all
day all night going to work and your
eyes look crazy take a yellow corrector
it'll save your life put it on before
you do the rest of your concealer this
is a concealer from essence it's a color
correcting stick and this is more of the
salmon shade so I'm gonna hit that right
there man essence has some really good
products okay so now I'm gonna set
everything in place in contour a little
bit I'm gonna take the wet and wild
contouring palette contour while my
concealer is fresh and my beauty sponge
is pretty damp I'm gonna go ahead and
take this powder contour right here I
mean this highlight right here and it is
matte so that's a good thing I'm gonna
take it right underneath my eye
and my secret for no cakiness under the
eyes no fine lines is to use a lightly
damp beauty sponge down the nose Plus
this area right here which you don't
have to do this is just like a personal
spot for me that I feel like needs a
little facelift so just work that in
with a beauty sponge so now we're gonna
contour and before the contour man take
this brush right here just this
tightly-packed dome fluffy kind of
fluffy brush so I'm gonna take this
shade of contour here which looks like a
really nice shade to contour with I'm
gonna take it right on under the
cheekbone and go just about halfway down
bring it all the way through the
hairline be careful don't get one get
helmet bronzer follow the natural curve
of your hairline wow this blends really
nicely into the skin maybe I don't even
have to put in much effort to blend it
I'm gonna work that backward so I'm
moving my brush up my cheek busting it
in upwards and take it right make sure
we have this area really nice and
blended so it all looks like it flows
together really nice and there's not
like a break go ahead and take that down
the nose I'm gonna go right here right
here on the side you guys know I kind of
do like a turned up button nose so I
take some down here and then I grab some
right here and bring it around
so it's a little more more rounded so it
looks like that looks kind of crazy at
first when you blend it out looks like a
new nose I'm gonna take some of that
setting powder on the side of the nose
like this I know it looks like a lot
right now but we blend it out into
nothing so the mixture of this
brightening plus the contouring together
really bringing out the shape so make
sure you don't skip one of these steps
if you're trying to create a new nose
shape on yourself I'm just gonna bronze
up with the the essence Sun Club bronzer
and natural so I'm gonna take a little
bit of that on this brush right here go
right on the cheek this one has more of
a orange undertone so this one works
really good as a bronzer you don't want
even use this as a contour and then I
have this blush right here from Lodi
London it's called a blush crush
is in the shade Zayn the one that left
one direction I hope I can't open this
and I take a little bit of that and pop
it on the cheek so we have another blush
right here it's called Drake oh my god
okay I get it now this is really cute I
take a little bit of that on the cheeks
too a little bit of Drake a little bit
of Zayn all mixed up into one okay so
for the highlight I'm gonna take this
Wet n Wild mega glow highlighting powder
in precious petals take that right on
the cheekbone this is a highlight you
definitely need to get yourself if
you're at the drugstore because wow this
is amazing I'm gonna take squad from
Lottie London and just the way it's
gliding on this ellipse you can tell
it's a good formula that is a really
pretty nude I like but it's not like
whitening out my face I'm gonna go right
on top with a liquid lip this is from
ELF this is in the shade praline wow
this is a really pretty lip color and it
feels really nice on the lips too so
that's a big plus that is the end of the
makeup look I really liked it it didn't
even take me long and I I loved how it
came out so I'm super excited for you
