my channel so today I'm gonna be doing
this super glam smokey I haven't done it
looked like this in a while something
very dramatic and dark I have not felt
this glam in a very long time I haven't
had this glam rock eye in a while and
I'm loving it if I'm having a girls
night out or for going clubbing which I
never do let me just not lie to you guys
right now but if I were to go clubbing I
definitely wear this and look it just
makes the eyes really stand out no
matter what I color you have have you
put these smoky dark shades around your
eye your eyes gonna stand out you know
what makes it look even better I had
that spotlight right on the lid and I'm
using this cream shadow from Revlon it's
the Revlon Colorstay cream shadow it is
very intense it's a super pigmented it's
like BAM I love it I am obsessed with
this look if you guys want to learn how
to get it then keep watching so I've
already prepped and primed my skin I'm
going to go ahead and go into some
foundation and start to even out my skin
tone and I'm going to be using my
fingers today to apply the foundation
just to it I feel like it warms the
product up really good and it melts into
your skin really nice so I like using my
fingers from time to time so now I'm
going to cover up my panda eyes I'm
gonna take some concealer and just make
a little V underneath my eyes to give
your eyes that lifted effect then I like
to take it all the way to the tops of
the cheekbone so it acts as a highlight
as well while we're at it I'm just going
to go ahead and highlight since we're
already pretty much doing the job so in
the middle of forehead the bridge of the
nose the Cupid's bow and right on the
chin and we're just going to dab dab dab
so now I'm going to fill in my brows I'm
going to take the Revlon Colorstay brow
pencil in dark brown and I like this
pencil because it has a little slanted
edge so you get that precise definition
and I'm going to go ahead and start to
work this on to the lower part of my
brow just to get the shape that I want
it's easy to get those hair like strokes
if you just flip the pencil on its side
right here on the edge and it gives you
sharp little hairs and then it's flat at
the tip so you can just fill in your
brows super easy so you get a little bit
more space so I'm just filling in the
sparse areas and this pencil is long
wearing and waterproof so it lasts up to
24 hours and I'm just brushing up the
hairs in place it also softens up the
harsh lines in case you have any but
this brow pencil is so good
so now we're going to get into the eye
shadow I'm going to take this color stay
cream eyeshadow in blackcurrant
and this is really cool it's a cream
shadow it has a built in brush right
here so you can use the brush to get
precise application and it's also it's
not gonna you know you're not going to
get it everywhere so it's mess-free
I'm going to use it in the cream shadow
and then rush it onto my eyelid this is
waterproof and it lasts up to 24 hours
so it's going to give you a long wear -
and I'm just going to put that all over
my lid kind of bring it into the inner
corners so I'm going to pick up this
shade right here and start to work that
in to my crease I'm just going to add up
to the crease I'm using windshield wiper
motions darkest part of the eye shadow
is going to be the outer corner of the
lid and then if you want to use less
pressure just take your hand and pull it
up to the top and it releases some of
the pressures so that it looks a little
bit more blended and soft I'm going to
add a little bit more to the inner part
of the eye and I'm going to bring it
around so it creates a halo effect and
I'm going to go back into the the color
stayed cream shadow and I'm going to pop
it in I'm just going to pop a little bit
more on to the center and when you put
anything on the center of your lid it's
going to really make your eyes stand out
because it's like it's like a highlight
to your eyes and I'm only using this one
eye shadow you don't really need a bunch
of eyeshadows if you use the right
amount of pressure on your brush you can
really get the effect of two eyeshadows
we're just using a little bit more
pressure around the inner and outer part
of the lid and then when we get up to
the crease area we're barely just
lightly blending the shadow I'm also
going to take the same color and work it
onto the lower part of the lash line and
whenever I have a heavy eye shadow look
on my lid I also like to just apply it
on the lower lash line so it balances
the eye look out and just ties
everything together now I'm going to
take the revlon colorstay two-in-one
angled Kajal and this is in the shade
onyx I'm gonna go ahead and start to
apply this to my lash line on the upper
lash line it also has an angled tip to
it so you can easily get those precise
lines
and I'm just going to smudge it into my
lashline and I like the way it's shaped
because it has this one and that's kind
of squared off and it fits in there
super easy and then if you want to make
longer lines and it has this longer side
right here
it glides on so easy and super dark it's
very black so now that we're all smoked
out I'm going to apply some mascara but
first I'm going to curl my lashes so I'm
going to go ahead and give them a few
pumps and sometimes when I curl my
lashes I can see the skin underneath
which I don't like so I'm going to go
back into the two-in-one angled Kajal
and just line the upper waterline so
it's dark and it doesn't look like
there's skin peeking through now I'm
just going to do a few coats of mascara
okay so now I'm going to add highlight
to my cheekbones the tip of my nose if
it's bow and right here just blend in
with my finger use a cream highlight it
gives you more of a natural looking
glowing from within kind of look so I
like to bring out my creams from time to
time I'm gonna use this translucent
powder right here it's not going to give
me any more color it's not going to give
me coverage is just going to set
everything in place
so you don't have to worry about it
taking away from the work that you've
already done and now for the lips I'm
going to use something that's nude
because the eyes are pretty dramatic so
I'm going to take this lip liner right
here this nudie lip liner and I'm going
to go over my lips start at the Cupid's
bow and then just move down the end of
my lip it goes really thin so I like to
bring it a little bit over the lip line
this is great for whenever you're over
lining your lips it makes it look a lot
more natural and then over top I'm going
to use a matte lip color another
so now I'm going to go into this nudie
peach blush I think it's going to work
well with the lip color and his title
will look together and I'm keeping it
behind the cheekbone so it gives the
face more of a natural flush of color
and you want to keep your eyes
the main focus so you don't want to go
too heavy on the blush or the lip you
want to use something that's very
neutral right around the temples and
this is kind of a little bit of the
draping technique we're not using it all
over our face but if you just pull it up
around your temples it gives your face a
little bit more structure and you
actually don't need a bronzer to do this
if you have just like a peach blush
it'll give you the same effect it's a
little bit more of a subtle effect very
natural thank you guys for watching I
