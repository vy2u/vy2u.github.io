nowhere well hi there we're doing things
differently now aren't we
hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today we're doing things a little bit
different we're starting off with no
makeup at all because we are using our
fingers to do our face I still just
floating around and seen nikkietutorials
do it Laura Lee and I'm like I gotta try
this thing out I want to see how good I
am with my hands so I'm gonna try to
slay a look today with just my fingers
the first thing I'm gonna do is get some
moisture into my face before I start
playing with my face I'm gonna take this
hydrating serum and I'm gonna work it
into my face ooh I like the way this
feels
it's very early it's like 6:00 in the
morning right now and I'm heading out to
New York so I want to get in a video
before I leave my under eyes are looking
crazy so I'm going to take this viescha
advanced eye brightening booster and put
it on with my fingers hopefully it'll
brighten my under eyes okay so for my
foundation I'm going to use the number 7
stay perfect foundation and just this
feels so gross by the way reminds me of
my high school video how do I do this
I'm wearing all white and I have a bunch
of foundation on my fingers let's pray
that I doesn't get out my shirt make
sure we get the neck without getting
them the shirt okay that looks good I'm
going to go ahead and take this
concealer right here oh okay so for my
concealer and my contour and everything
I'm going to be using the honest Asya
contour palette just so that I can dip
my hands into it easy these guys start
to put them underneath my eyes so far so
good
so for my eyes I'm going to go into my
Anasazi ash Brown pomade I'm gonna use
my finger hey here we go oh my god
do you see that it's underneath my
fingernail oh that's so uncomfortable
okay
okay here we go we're just going to
shoot let me get really close
I'm carving out the brow first okay
we're gonna keep carving out the brow
well we're not really carving it out at
this point I don't know what we're doing
but we're doing something um I I don't
know what to say at this point it's
pretty bad maybe I should have used my
other fingers I could be a little bit
more precise really cute I'm just gonna
get some concealer on my finger and my
clean finger and just clean it up this
can be like my primer - I think it would
help if I had nails I literally have no
nails that took a million years but I
got it together with these two nasty
dirty fingers and a lot of concealer um
now I'm going to jump into the eye
shadow I'm gonna start off using these
shades right here from morphe 35o and
I'm gonna start off by using this shade
right here I'm just gonna put it all
over the crease I mean all over the lid
with my fingers that's not too bad and
I'm thinking we're gonna do a smokey eye
with this look be prepared just kind of
flick it up towards the brow bone and
then I'm gonna use this finger this
newly clean finger to blend out the
shadow we don't want any harsh lines my
eyes crying oh don't you hate that when
you're Ike rising that it messes up all
the side of your eye next Oh next
transition shade is going to be our eyes
are going to look like a little leaf
that has just fallen on the ground
because it's basically dead I'm going
for a dead leaf look I'm just gonna wear
it out then I'm going to go into this
elf palette it's called the clay shadow
palette and smoked to perfection I think
this is gonna be good for our smokey eye
so I'm gonna go in to that black okay
this is getting a little difficult with
the darker shades but it's not as bad as
I thought it was going to be just a
little bit
is just a little difficult I'm having to
use to clean figures to do it I can't
believe we've even came this far with
what we have on our face okay so next
I'm going to go in with the dist dose of
colors I deal duo and maple I don't know
if this is helping me or making it a
little bit worse I highlight with this
shade right here on the inner corners
I'm going to use a little bit more black
so I'm going to go into this elf palette
on the outer corner and I'm going to use
one of my clean fingers just to blend it
out the line a little bit on the top
blend out this harsh line really quick
and then for the eyeliner I'm going to
use this eyeliner right here the I do
liquid eyeliner from eiko and I'm going
to watch it right here and try to pick
up as much eyeliner as I can from my
hand it's an intense single stroke of
black this nail and run it across my
lashes bye baby I love you it's not
looking it's looking better
you don't like it this is so unsanitary
thank God for there's a one tiny nail
that is getting some of some use by baby
that is not that bad I'm proud of myself
this is never gonna get out of my nail
so now I'm going to put on some
eyelashes this is the Elizabeth Amy June
lashes are elute Amy June lashes in
Elizabeth we are going to pop them on
I'm just gonna use take some glue okay
I'm just dipping in my lashes in this
blue usually I use my tools because I
saw putting on my lashes with my hands
so I always use a tool I'm going to push
it in there that inner corner is giving
me so much trouble mascara I am NOT
ready for this right now and put some on
my lashes like this oh and we need to
get the top one the eyes aren't so bad
I'm gonna go back to the face I'm going
to go ahead and try to put on some more
foundation because we need to clean this
mess up using some of this makeup
forever concealer on my fingers I'm
gonna take all of it clean up this mess
concealer is our friend let's try to
contour I'm gonna take the lightest
shade in the palette with my finger and
go down my nose when the nose and
something on his nose I me on this side
blend it out highlight shade in there
and just go down the nose all of the
clean fingers to blend it for the blush
I'm using this bellapierre mineral blush
and autumn glow that is very pretty it's
like a nice peachy shade kind of like a
blush and a bronzer Ilyn one my favorite
highlights right now are from G way they
came out these highlights that are so
people so I'm going to take this topaz
one right here and this highlight is so
bright it is brighter than my teeth and
then just put it on my temples get your
sunglasses out
I'm just obsessing over this highlight
okay so next we are gonna do the lips
which doesn't seem too hard I'm going to
take this dose of colors shade right
here and bear with me so I'm just going
to put some on my hand so liquid
lipstick so it shouldn't be too bad
and I'm use my finger my magic finger
and start to work it on my lips I can't
believe I did my entire face with my
fingers and it doesn't look that bad
it's like I don't think people would
notice like did you do your face with
your fingers this morning I don't think
people would say that and we are done
with the look not too bad we've used a
lot of things on our hands and I feel
pretty dry this lotion came in the Ipsy
glam bag right here this is the naked
advanced aloe cream and I'm just gonna
put it on my hands ooh
I needed this very badly last thing I
need to do is just put some dry
conditioner in my hair I think that will
help me out a little bit and this is
supposed to help with frizziness so I
obviously need help with that area of my
life right now this is from Eva and my
siesta forget-me-nots dry conditioner
it's supposed to lightweight
conditioning detailing softness shine
for all hair types that helped me out a
little bit
I think we did pretty good I'm gonna say
