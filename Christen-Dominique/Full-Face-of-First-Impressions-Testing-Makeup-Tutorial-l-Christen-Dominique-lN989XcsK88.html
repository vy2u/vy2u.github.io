Texas again and if you guys want to see
how I got this look and all the new
makeup that I got in how I feel about it
how it wears and what it looks like then
keep watching and let's get the show on
the road
so the first thing I'm going to use is
this laura geller
spackle mist it supposed to be a primer
toner
- burp you know when a burp doesn't want
to come out and just stuck in your
throat like a frog it feels really good
when you blow air on your face after
spraying this it feels so refreshing I
can definitely tell that it's going to
hydrate my skin my skin just feels so
much better okay the next thing I'm
going to use is the hourglass vanish
foundation I have heard so many great
things about this foundation stick the
coverage I've heard is amazing let's try
to sing on my face completely took away
my mole which is good I guess I feel
like this would be really good for
on-the-go makeup put it on everywhere
and then you just blend it in I
definitely see that it covers everything
thankfully this is a little bit too dark
for me but maybe we can work with it
somehow it does feel very lightweight
next for the concealer I'm gonna use the
amazing cosmetics amazing concealer for
some reason I don't know why I used to
think this was amazing I don't know why
but for some reason oh I have light
golden and light honey I think I'm gonna
go with this lighter one this concealer
is also full coverage and a little runny
as you can see so I mix them together
now this does if you like weight as well
but it also is supposed to be very full
coverage we're doing really good with
the products here today if you're
looking for full coverage you want to
cover everything on your face it's gonna
make you look lawless the only thing is
it comes in these little tubes I don't
know I'm not a fan of it it's just a
little bit Messier but the coverage is
really good alright I look human I got
some eyebrows on my face
okay so let's get into the eyes I'm
gonna go ahead and take this Rebecca
Stella palette oh so it goes like this
it's like a magnet which is cool I'm
going to go ahead and pick up this shade
right here and dress work it onto my
entire lid and I'm just going to Pat
that all over my eyelid to even out
everything
and my eye sugar going to just glide
onto my lid would sweaty adhere sweaty
up in here I'm gonna go ahead and take
the colour-pop kpop eyeshadow in
Wilshire this is part of the Karrueche
collection by the way I just met her
this weekend and she is just the biggest
sweetheart ever and she's absolutely
beautiful I'm gonna go ahead and take
Wilshire and it's this matte eyeshadow
I'm gonna go ahead and pop it onto my
lid and kind of work it all the way into
the crease I'm gonna lay this down first
because these eyeshadows from colour-pop
are very creamy and I feel like they're
gonna work really good as a nice base in
the next color I'm gonna take is the
kpop Crenshaw eyeshadow it's a little
bit of a darker Brown and I'll work it
onto my finger and then just apply it to
my lid like this and I'm starting at the
base of my lid and I'm working it
upwards the crease and then flicking it
out towards the end of my brow and this
is a cream so it doesn't have to be
perfect you can make it a little bit
messy it is very blendable and buildable
this is a very pretty color and then I'm
just going to take this shade right here
and I'm going to work that onto the
entire lid I'm just loading up the brush
and I'm gonna pop on the shade right
onto the lid and just cover the entire
lid space and we're gonna work the shade
blending it towards the brow bone we're
working everything upwards oh I have an
itch if you ever have an itch
slap it don't scratch it because these
scratches it's gonna irritate your skin
and then spread all around the area that
you're scratching just slapping I'm
gonna take the morphe M 501 and just
start to blend out the edges if you're
trying to blend a shadow out and you
want it to be nice and soft you want to
keep your hand towards the back of the
brush and just softly go back and forth
blend everything out very nice and
smooth like sir I think I'm gonna do
purple okay so I decided to go with the
purple from the Sigma palette it's
called russet I'm going to go ahead and
pop it onto the entire lid everything
that we used before it is just gonna
help it look really pretty and
transition really smoothly
all that work we just did on our eyelids
trust me it is worth it so I'm just
going to place my eyeshadow brush right
in the middle and just start to work it
out then I'm going to take my more
you 511 whatever I had on the brush
before I'm just gonna buff it into the
crease just just smooth out the lines
ooh that looks good yes it's not
palpable this one the kpop Renshaw Oh
Pro Ruchi now it's set so now I'm just
going to clean up all of the fallout
that I have so I'm just going I'm going
to go ahead and do the lower part of the
lash line and for that I'm going to take
this Sigma shade right here this is the
cinnamon this is cinnamon and excuse my
little boy hands okay so I'm going to
take that shade right there and just
because it kind of looks similar to the
creamy shade but I'm going to use
powders on the lower lash line so it
doesn't get smudgy and remember these
are going to peak through another shadow
so you want to put them a little bit
lower low blow for the next shade I'm
going to take this one right here this
is cozy so I'm going to take that one I
feel like these are really pretty fall
colors I'm gonna go ahead and take that
shade and just pop it onto the outer
part of the lid the lower lash line I
mean right there I think that looks cute
and then we're gonna take the purple
kpop is so similar to russet in the
Sigma palette I'm going to use this
one's a little bit more creamier I'm
going to use it as an eyeliner on the
lower lash line which is using all kinds
of eyeshadows today I'm not going to go
in all the way with this one I'm going
to just keep it kind of open case you
guys are wondering this is an awesome
winged liner brush and it's from zoeva
it's a three seventeen winged liner
because it's so precise I'm going to
take russet work with me all it's going
to do is help the powder really stick on
to the lower lash line so I'm going to
go ahead and do that I'm just going to
put it on the outer part of the lower
lash line
and then I'm going to blend it this is
the morphe 506 I'm just going to blend
it like that and then for the inner
corners I'm going to grab this shade
right here this is the Sunset Boulevard
gonna take a clean brush and just kind
of blend out the edges a little bit
right here just so it looks a little bit
more seamless that looks good and take
an eyeliner that I haven't used and it
looks
very interesting so this eyeliner is
from ciate and it's called chisel
eyeliner it's really cute packaging it
has little bows all over it and this is
interesting because it's like a marker
it has a slant to it and if you turn it
it goes a little bit wider and then it
has like a little point so I'm
interested to see how this is going to
work out on my eye lid today so I'm
gonna try to create a winged liner with
this wish me luck
it's a super super black I don't know if
it's easier or is it just I have to use
it a little bit more to say I like it or
not I don't hate it and I don't love it
but it is really light this is flower
the cosmetic line from drew barrymore
it's her mascara it's really interesting
in the top says twist three and one
lengthen curl in volumize and it has
these three different mascara wands on
it so I don't know if it changes mascara
wands or what I'm gonna twist it oh my
god oh this is so cool did you see that
let me just do it again for you guys
this is so cool so lengthen right it
goes straight what does this one do curl
and then volume eyes this is so cool so
now it's time for the lashes the lashes
are really cool they're from mosquito
and they are so pretty easy all wispy
they are and they're kind of PC know I
love my PC lashes I'm gonna go ahead and
take these and pop them onto my lashes
ooh this is pretty I'm going to contour
my nose and my cheeks
that's pretty much all I focus on so I'm
going to take this light shade right
here and I'm gonna stop right below the
cheekbone you don't want to go any
further than that and this will work
good to do the size of the nose this is
the perfect ashy Brown so it looks like
a natural shadow I know sometimes we do
things because they're trendy and we see
other people doing them it's what
they're doing on Instagram and we're
doing on YouTube but if you really don't
need to contour your temples or your
forehead it's just a step that you don't
have to do but if you want to try it out
of course try it out see if you like it
and if you can incorporate it into your
makeup and make it your
so I'm going to use this Bare Minerals
bear Pro powder and this is in the shade
golden nude 13 load it up load it up
that the desert did it I did it that is
my exact comb for the bronzer I'm going
to use this you a bronzer and this is in
the shade Sun sweat I'm just going to
add some color to my cheeks oh this is
gonna bring my face to life and then I'm
going to add some blush I'm going to use
the balloon blush from su-wei looks like
this I'm going to sweep it on my
cheekbone you fit back into the hairline
okay we have two really pretty
highlighters in the house tonight
I'm going to go ahead and take this one
that is a little bit messed up but it's
okay because it's still beautiful okay
it's a flex attack nothing ever happened
even over a powder these guys work so
beautifully this are unlaced and i like
the packaging is so modern it glides on
like a gloss but it gives you that
intense color and coverage of an actual
lipstick I swear goes on like a gloss
but then it's like a semi matte
high-impact color I've never seen blippi
like this before and I'm impressed
