friend Christie with him so excited
first time she's ever done something

you want to see how we got these looks
right here then okay so I'm gonna start
off with this primer this is from
Smashbox is to photo finish primer and
it's hydrating I need this because my
skin is so dry right now but tonight we
have this team smash my oil-free pore
minimizing mm-hmm
Oh yours is hydrating mm-hmm but yeah
this one I've been using for a while I
like it mm-hmm
from my pores closed and oh my god I put
my eyebrow I did a little bit of
eyebrows before I got on and I was about
to smear them all over my face have you
tried this the NARS soft matte I know
everything everyone's talking about that
though is it too like clean up my brows
that is put it all over my eyelid
well there goes my base I'm I'm like way
too lazy to use a case now unfortunately
I was actually thinking today I was like
Christina you need to get your life
together and get an eyeshadow base
there's like some black eyeshadow on
this brush so that's why you need to
watch you brush it whew this is a good
bag the pro edition the block okay so we
should tell them story time how we met
Kristen and I met three years ago once
upon a time Kristen and I met three
years ago and I was like who is this a
little cutie from Texas and how is she a
mom because she looks so young and
precious and she was so friendly and she
had dark hair I did this is how I
started this dark hair and now we work
here still friends mm-hmm it feels like
ten years ago
it does but Kristen's always been super
super sweet of one of the nicest people
in industry never has anything bad to
say about anybody and yes and we live
only like really in reality on a map we
live like two miles from each other but
because of traffic yeah I guess they
already get traffic kicks your butt in
LA when I remember any time she would
compliment my makeup I was like like it
was like the best thing ever
well it's crazy how much you've
transformed since then I know I think I
was really good then I'll look back and
be like wow like cringe I'm gonna start
my eyes my eyeshadow I'm using the viola
box palettes I'm gonna take Erika I'm
gonna pop her all over my lid for my
eyeshadow I'm just gonna use Kristen's
bullet it's big enough for the both of
us so I'm gonna use my two essential
blending brushes a bigger fluffy brush
and a smaller one all I use on the
crease dang that is a good palette you
guys staring at me I'm going to use this
color pop like a condensed version
basically it's like one row that it is
gonna mix these two in the upper crease
area I should put on my customer service
voice real quick
or the creeps today we're going to do
for my crease I'm going to use Abigail
and Alice friends so you're doing crease
crease like I'm gonna grab the shade
called Amy from Kristin's eyeshadow
palette very lovely maroon grape shade
just what I need in my life and I'm
gonna use the same brush Oh little
bright this is a lot brighter than I
expected so I'm out to do something not
that I'm opposed to a bright eye look
just not what I was had in mind
I almost adopted a dog you did it what
kind it was a chihuahua Oh
how come you did it someone adopted it
before me oh oh and I think he's getting
a dog now I really want one but then
it's like I'm gonna take it to Goku and
all that others done just be so
responsible yeah I'm had to be
responsible that's why I have the cat I
already have a kid was a lot of
commitment yeah dude I really really
want one but then I think about it - am
i you didn't wake up until 11 last
weekend and buta
mm-hmm yeah you can't do that I'm
picking up Riley now I'm gonna pick up
Courtney now Elite can I use Kylie I
want to use this one oh yeah go ahead
wait girl show it up show the love that
has been given to this panic hmm
okay so I'm gonna take krispies very
well-loved palette this is her child
it's used to the abuse I'm gonna pick
this one the fragran fudge fudge was a
good one and I'm gonna work that into
the outer crease along see it's so big
it's so penguin dude let's do a gold
Jessica let's take the shade pack it
onto the lid I was like one of the
things I learned when I started working
at Mac I felt so professional so you you
pack it onto the lid and why see liner
is no longer available in the u.s. it's
kind of tricky to get online so this is
a dupe for it this is the NYX matte
liquid liner
and it's really really good for the wing
I'm gonna take the TARDIS this is such a
black liner like it's super super dark
and it's the hardest double-take it's
the double take liner so one side is the
liquid liner and then the other side is
the pencil but I've already used it so
much it's just the liner now I'm gonna
start on my wing I use one of the TARDIS
black pencil liners for like when I'm
going to the gym mm-hmm you put on
makeup to go to the gym oh of course
so I was like dude I love this pencils
like this is a great pencil I looked at
it and it's actually a lip pencil oh my
god really I've been using it for like a
year these are the ones that I use like
all the time thanks for these are your
main bitches hmm when I'm rolling please
ease these are the ashcombe on Instagram

good it's my crusty a slash slash cake I

show it cuz it's really bad mine is
words derive cosmetics when I honestly
feel like I still haven't mastered
lashes like I still experience a
moderate level of difficulty putting on
lashes thank you dude I want to be like
a bronze goddess for Coachella yes I
want it I had a dream I literally had a
dream that I was wearing a different
color wig with a coordinating outfit for
each day one day I was wearing a pink
wig with a pink outfit next day blue
with blue and then white with white it
was like Nicki Minaj okay we need
Instagram the curve I'm going to use the
Tarte shape tape for my under eyes
brighter than ever I'm gonna bronze I've
deviated from our flow so this is
SunPower from Mac it's a little actually
kind of red oh wait I totally forgot to
set my foundation
