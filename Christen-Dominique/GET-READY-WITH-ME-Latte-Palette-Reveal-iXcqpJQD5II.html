today is one of the most exciting videos
I have ever done on my channel and I've
never had to do this many interest today
I'm revealing my cosmetic line domini
cosmetics so weird to say domine
cosmetics latte palette I have giving
you sneak peeks for awhile now and it is
finally here
are you ready tada this is my baby as
you guys know I'm a mom Jaden is my son
this is my second child dominique
cosmetics and then the palette i am
shaking right now by the way here is the
palettes dominate a lot a palette i have
worked so hard on both of these guys the
front the back everything is all my
creation i will go into more of it a
little bit but first i want to announce
something for you guys i have a special
gift
i'm giving away 5 latte palettes along
with a $100 gift card to go along with
it so that you can get anything you need
to create a full look with the palette
and all you have to do is follow
dominique cosmetics instagram I will
have it right here for you guys to
follow and also be sure to sign up for
the website so you're the first to know
when the palette pre-launch is it
actually pre launches on the 24th but
you will be the first to know exactly
when it's out and ready to go
alright so now that I have announced
that to you guys I am going to go into
lot a palette itself and I'm gonna try
not to get emotional because this is my
baby literally we've been working on her
for about a year and a half and we're
here at this moment right now
oh my gosh I don't even know where to
start I'm gonna start with what it looks
like this is the sleeve
such a unique coppery rose gold it's
super sleek it's like a brushed foil
with the DC on it which is my logo and
dominique cosmetics on the back it has a
lot a palette with the colors behind it
the ingredients and all my handles for
dominique cosmetics and then we are
going to open it up it's a white palette
but it's super easy to clean that's one
of the things I was thinking when I was
making it it's white I want it to be
very Instagram
well something like an accessory but at
the same time I want it to be easy to
clean as I have dirtied it so many times
and it cleans like a dream this is the
back I was actually inspired by this
gorgeous pillow it had like these
different textures on it but it was
basically like a geometric pillow and it
looked really cool and that's what
really inspired the palette itself and
the broken lines around it this is like
a dream like I can't I don't even the
words in my head are like scrambling but
I'm just in all of this moment right now
so if I sound out of breath it's just
because I'm super excited and nervous at
the same time I worked really hard on
this palette and I'm so so excited and
happy to bring it to you as you guys
know I started off with an eyeliner
brush to create fuller lips uh-huh so
I've talked about that video before and
now I'm here with my own cosmetic line
with my own palette that I've put all of
my heart in tears I literally cried and
threw things about this palette to get
it to where it is today so it does mean
everything to me and my career has
basically led up to this moment so it's
kind of like it's kind of scary and
exciting to talk about the same time
because you want everything to come out
right let's open it up you can see what
the inside looks like this is the inside
of the palette has a really nice fit
protector for your shadows you have a
large mirror that you can see my camera
in the pan sizes of the shadows I
purposely made them a little bit larger
than normal because I wanted you to get
as much product as possible and at the
same time somebody that's on the go I
want them to be able to dip their powder
brush in there as you can see there's
like a banana shade the vanilla cream is
a yellow undertone and you'll see how I
use it in this video and actually set
your concealer and brighten your eye all
of these shades are very buttery and
creamy but they're also buildable it's
something that's gonna start off soft
and then you can layer it to a very
vibrant pigmented color I wanted these
shadows to be very easy to work with no
matter where your skill is I know
there's some people out there that don't
know how to work with extremely
pigmented shadows so I made sure that
these
shadows are buildable to a very high
pigment but you can start off soft the
color payoff is amazing and I'm going to
show you that while I'm talking about
the shadows you use all of the pallet
except for about three colors so I'm
going to show you double shot double
shot is a matte purple with a red
undertone the next color is creme brulee
this is a foil shadow the foils are so
creamy they glide on your skin like
butter and there's very pigmented
actually creme brulee was made to match
the outside of the palette this foil
color was actually pretty hard to get
because this isn't like a very common
rose gold kind of coppery foil so I
wanted to create a color that is very
similar to this because I just wanted to
put this all over my eye espresso is a
cool tone brown with these gold shimmers
going straight through the color it's
just one of the most beautiful colors
this and I'll show you how the other
colors swatch throughout the video as I
use them this is the perfect size you
can throw it in your purse you can use
it for different parts of your face so
the price point for this palette is $42
this is a luxe formula and there are
crushed real crushed pearls in the foils
you're getting a nice pan size a
beautiful accessory for yourself I
wanted most of the shades to be matte so
you can have really detailed dimension
in your eye if you wanted someone to
tell you how latte palette came about my
mom loves coffee as much as I do and she
always made this girl time for us where
we drink coffee and we talked and they
we'd always have flavored coffee that
was I couldn't have coffee without
flavor also basically not coffee as I
grew up that became part of my routine I
shared it with you guys on snapchat and
began to share it with you all the time
so much that mean you guys had a bond
through our morning coffee I would get
snaps from you guys in your coffee mugs
and it just became something that really
brought us together and I love lattes
lattes a beautiful name I love the foam
on top of the latte and I just thought
that this would be perfect it goes
perfectly with the warmth of the shadows
the feel of the palette the look of the
palette and that's how the latte palette
came about if you want to know more
about the palette I will talk about it
throughout the video if you want to
learn how to get this look right here
and more about the latte palettes and
don't forget
to subscribe to my channel and hit that
notification bell so you could be a part
of the quad family and without further
ado let's get on with the video
I'm so excited to film this video I
don't even know where to start
here we go I already did my brows so
that they can be ready for somebody even
out my skin I already put on primer so I
just found this in my last video this is
a really good foundation instead of
using my hand I've been using this more
recently just like a little mixing plate
so I don't have to get my hands full of
foundation like I normally do I'm just
gonna take my moist Beauty but oh that's
I don't like that word damp Beauty
Blender and work that into my skin it
looks lighter right now but it
definitely oxidizes just a bit down to
my exact skin tone and this is the shade
23 peach so I'm gonna go ahead and prime
my eyes with you tart shape tip
concealer in light medium here's my
Beauty Blender and work that in to my
eye so I have a nice even smooth base to
work on so I'm gonna go ahead and get
into the eyes this is a really exciting
moment for me I am going to be using for
the first time on camera a latte palette
here we go so the first color I'm gonna
start off with is vanilla creams it has
a warm yellow undertone it's really
buttery and creamy and just glides on
the eye so beautifully I specifically
created this shade for dullness around
the eye to brighten up any type of
dullness that you have you can even set
your under-eye concealer with this it's
kind of like that banana shade but an
eyeshadow form and I want to give thanks
to my mom for this shadow because I was
born with super dark under-eye circles
it's just hereditary for me and my
family and I was kind of teased about it
in school so I was so tired of it and my
mom had this yellow concealer actually
she didn't know that I grabbed it but I
grabbed it I put it on and went to
school I felt a whole lot better about
my face that day and everybody's like oh
wow your eyes look really good today and
that was kind of like my first step into
this world of makeup and really loving
and embracing what makeup can do for you
inside outside and I was color
correcting and I didn't even realize
that was color correcting and I love
yellow for dullness and
darkness around the eyes so thanks mom
for your concealer because now I have it
as an eye shadow it gives you such a
bright beautiful fresh youthful look I
have seven matte shades so that you can
get a lot of dimension and you can
create a lot of different looks with
this shadows I don't know if you guys
notice that in my videos I like to have
a wide selection of transition shades so
I made sure that I had enough of those
transition shades in the palette so I'm
gonna take caramel which is the lightest
transition shade in the palette and it
is truly a warm smooth caramel color and
I wish it smelled like caramel but I
didn't want to irritate anybody's skin
or somebody just doesn't like the smell
so for my first palette I was like you
know what I'm just gonna put it on the
note card so when you get it you still
get that full effect but it's just not
embedded in the shadows so I'm gonna
take caramel and pop that on to my
crease and this is just going to add a
soft subtle definition what I wanted to
create with these shadows is a buildable
type of formula this shadow is going to
really build up so you can start kind of
soft in your crease and then build up
the shadows so I'm just gonna work that
all into the crease and I'm gonna extend
it to the end of the brow bone for the
next transition shade I'm going to take
pumpkin spice every time I say one of
the shadows I get giddy I don't know I
just get like this it's a weird feeling
I just get really like ahh so I'm gonna
take pumpkin spice and work that in the
crease as well so I'm gonna have a nice
warm crease but I'm gonna keep this
towards the center going back to the
brow it's almost like the shadows are
related to each other because they
complement each other so well they just
melt into one another and that's kind of
what I wanted for you guys to create
really easy on your own without even
thinking about it so you can see caramel
and then you have pumpkin spice it's so
easy for them to transition into one
another I'm gonna blend this out but I
don't want to go all the way to the
inner corner with this and just build up
that crease for the third crease color
I'm going to take hazelnut hazelnut is a
coffee that I'm drinking right now it's
such a pretty
Ferrero Rocher I don't know it just
makes me think of that in an eyeshadow
form I'm actually gonna take a hazelnut
and work it on the outer V of the eye
and extend it all the way towards the
end of the brow colors just blend so
easy into one another it's like butter
so my camera shut off and I already have
this drama happening on this ice so I
want to amp up the drama and the eye
look so I'm gonna take mocha which is a
beautiful matte chocolatey Brown it can
take you from a daytime to a nighttime
dramatic look so without being black and
I'm just gonna focus that on the outer V
like right on the end and the brush that
I'm using is the morphe M 507 and I like
it because you can start off soft and
you can definitely end up very bold and
dramatic with any of these eyeshadows
you can start off soft and can go really
bold while I was making these I wanted
like the most pigmented shadow and as I
was working with the chemist and
formulating the shadows I realized that
if you have too much pigment then it
won't blend and it kind of sticks and
it's just a balancing act I've learned
so much with formulating these shadows
so I made sure that they were buildable
a lot goes into making a cosmetic line
it takes a long time to get what you
want when I was testing the shadows out
I would always test without any
concealer or any primer on my skin and
then I would test with primer and I made
sure that no matter what if you have a
primer or you don't you're still gonna
get a nice payoff without it be crazy
where you can't move it around and not
everybody can use shadows that are super
intensely pigmented so I wanted it to be
a formula for every and anyone and I
wanted to make it super easy to follow
the colors coordinate and you really
can't go wrong with any color you use
together in the palette so I put a lot
of work into the color scheme and I went
back and forth on the Browns the mocha
actually almost turned black but looked
brown so it's it's a real balancing act
getting these shadows to perform it
look as good as they do in the pan
because you can put it on your eye and
it's black or it's a different color or
it doesn't blend so it's it takes it
takes a lot and it takes a lot of
research and learning this is something
that I've always wanted to do this is
like a new journey in my life that I've
always wanted but never thought that I
could really do until now very fortunate
that I'm able to do this and really put
my heart and soul into this formula into
these colors designing it naming it
really put my everything and I hope you
guys love it because um it means a lot
to me now I'm gonna go ahead and pop on
one of the foils which are so beautiful
I can't even begin to tell you how
beautiful these foils are they are made
with real crushed pearls and I just I
feel like I got to show you because it's
so so freakin good well I'm trying to
figure out do I want creme brulee
macchiato or espresso I'm gonna go with
macchiato for the inner part of my eye
you could even leave it like this it's
so pretty but I'm gonna go ahead and pop
on a foil whoo I can't believe I'm using
a foil I'm using a foil on camera okay
so I'm gonna take macchiato which is a
beautiful champagne color with soft gold
flecks going throughout the shadow I
just when I see this I just take a
breath like it's beautiful
I went back and forth on so many
variations of these three foil colors
it's insane I actually changed one of
them last minute which is creme brulee
to match the the outside packaging and
that is a beautiful color as well it's
more of the rose gold but I'm gonna go
ahead and take macchiato and work this
on the inner half and I had my friends
try them that came over to my house and
they were so excited for them they
wanted to use them as highlights and I
was like oh maybe later but this is what
they are now and if you want that
Instagram highlight you can definitely
use it
and bring that down to the inner corner
to highlight the inner corner as well I
just want to use all of the foils on my
eyes I have more tutorials coming but
you're gonna see so many different looks
that I'm gonna create with this I cannot
wait to show you but this is just one of
the many looks that you can do take a
wing liner brush some fix+ wet my brush
up and dip it into a macchiato and I'm
gonna create a wing with macchiato
for the lashes I'm gonna use my ikonics
because those are not thieves
just wait 30 to 40 minutes I mean 30 to
40 seconds and then pop them on so while
I'm doing this I'll go ahead and put on
concealer for concealer I'm going to use
the Tarte shape tape just put that on so
we don't have any crazy dark circles
while my concealer is still kind of wet
I'll go ahead and grab a translucent
powder pop it on right before it dries I
feel like it sets it it brightens it but
there's a really small window of time
where you get the most out of your
powder in your Beauty Blender you can
see life so don't underneath my eye
really look up to the heavens and pack
it on I'm gonna let that sit on my face
for a second I'm gonna go in to hazelnut
and work that on the lower lash line
first I'm just gonna do a little bit
halfway you can go all the way in for
the lower lash line I'm gonna use hold
Bru I absolutely love cold-brew it's a
deep turquoise kind of color and it's
just the perfect mix of blue and green
together and you can use it all over
your eye you can use it on the lower
lash line like I am for just a pop of
color I think you're going to die for
cold-brew you were going to love cold
Bruce so much this will definitely be a
lot of your guys's favorite color I can
feel it because when I was making it I
just kept like I kept taking this deep
breath because it's such a beautiful
color so is double shot if you're going
for a soft eye shadow liner kind of look
cold-brew as a liner is beautiful I'm
gonna pop back into caramel so I'm gonna
blend this through the edge of cold-brew
I just want to thank my mom's painting
that she gave me because it inspired
this color I actually have it right here
I'm gonna show you guys
I was so inspired by these tones of blue
for cold brew that I was like okay we
have to make this happen and our eyes
are done oh my gosh I love this looks so
much it's so easy for everybody to do
the pops of color perfect I purposely
made the shadows a little bit larger
than normal so you can easily fit a face
brush in the shadow and really use it as
a multi-purpose palette and I just want
to use this whole palette all over my
face but you can easily set a face brush
in here and pop it in and it's gonna fit
easily without getting into the other
colors I wanted this to truly be a mult
something multi-purpose so in case you
don't have your bronzer or you can't set
your under eyes you have your eyeshadow
palette and it can do all those things
for you I'm gonna contour with my
Natasha - Nonna palette right here and
this is in medium I'm actually gonna use
vanilla cream to highlight the center
and right across I'm gonna use vanilla
cream on my under eyes to show you how
balm vanilla cream is for the under eye
comfortably putting it into vanilla
cream and it just brightens everything
up it is such a multi-purpose palette
you guys are going to love this palette
and it is $42 but you are getting so
much product so I'm going to use it
right in here and I like to use it right
around the corners of my mouth to where
it's kind of dark for the highlight I'm
actually gonna use macchiato I'm gonna
start off with hover from Mac and then
I'm gonna take the Y asal lipstick in
number seven this little guy right here
I don't know if you guys can see it but
I'm actually shaking because I'm I'm
done creating a look with my palette in
the reveal and I just I'm shaking inside
I don't know we could see a bit this is
the final look
