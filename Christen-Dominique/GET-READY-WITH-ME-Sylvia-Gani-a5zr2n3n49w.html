further ado let's get on right in okay
what are using for primarily been using
because I love it so much
girly I feel so ridiculous every time I
say that but the lore primer I'm clearly
not French but it's very expensive so I
always feel very guilty about talking
about it but it's just so good try it
please try it it has like a little
different one this time let's hang out
little gold flakes in it wait maybe I
should try as much about things they
know I love this one it blurs out
everything makes your skin bright and
shiny sting money right now
is this eighty bucks something Canadian
I think or 70 something I know I'm
pretty sure it's like up there like
something but it's such a beautiful
bottle it's beautiful it's okay okay
believe us it just you believe us when
we tell you it's theirs I mean it better
be cute for that much money
yeah yeah and those gold flecks better
be doing something crazy with their skin
to try this has you rave about it all
the time hmm looks like you have a lot
in here too how much do I need not a lot
not a lot or goes a long way let me just
use up all your product this feels
expensive my skin is like briar baby
skin right now yeah it does it feels so
good smells absolutely delicious I feel
like it does do the blurring my my head
feels really smooth and I have really
bad like texture my foreheads so so far
we're like I'm gonna use the makeup
forever this time this is the ultra HD
classic classic classic I'm gonna use to
face the Born This Way over here Z we're
coming together but I think I'm gonna go
with my Urban Decay brow beater great
name
oh this is freakin good that sauces is
so good it's so affordable I just love
it it lasts all day I'm actually
surprised I need to try it
cuz I've never tried it um no but my
brow hairs are actually really really
coarse so I can't really do much with
them like you can create a whole new
shape if you want it to because your
brow hairs are so like yeah like fine
and like soft mine are like pubic hair
or something my brow oh yeah I'm gonna
use that on the outer part of the brow
you do that ombre effect I try the
straight vowel thing clearly and I don't
think it works on my face shape so now
I'm trying to go back can't do it now
because I like a win story and once you
go straight you can't go back it's scary
we'll use what I hold on I'm trying to
finish this just focus week month I've
ever done yeah now we're moving on to
concealer I always use my concealer as
primer too so I'm going to set my primer
and you will need
I recently did a video I literally just
drop it today
testing out Marc Jacobs a bunch of Mike
Jacobs makeup so I recently tried their
concealer and I actually really like it
it's like creamy but full coverage it
kinda reminds me of the Norton Arzo AHA
mapper or a complete soft matte I'm
gonna know I can't find the right shades
for me in the NARS one this is not too
pink not clean up my brows and stuff
with that one denars yeah I could see
that alright so I'm just gonna blend in
this face how'd you get ahead of me okay
this concealers everything here we go I
don't know I did that just tapping off
my concealer so I guess I'm using the
remarkable concealer from Marc Jacobs
full coverage very creamy here's
something that's full coverage and it's
creamy do that like skin like finish
yes I'm like give me it right now I feel
like I'm only using expensive products
which is so weird for me traveling so
basically everything I'm using in this
video is like the items that I've been
my go-to recently so I just threw my bag
and I'm like okay I'll just go with that
for my trip and then everything else is
kind of like my OG products yeah so
probably boring if you're watching me a
lot because you know I use these like
pretty consistently but it is what it is
I'm using the Jaclyn hill palette that's
a good one
yes I'm kind of late to the party on
this one for sure but it's an amazing
palette so I'm gonna try and create a
look with it Kylie Jacqueline so I'm
gonna go into all the transition shades
so that's this one right here we're just
gonna go in there I'm gonna highlight my
brow bone with one of these bad boys
probably a little mixture both of them
you know oh you're starting with the
brow bone highlight
different do you do that laughs what do
you I do that laughs I like to do that
first and then I kind of bring it down
you're like I can't really blend it very
well if I do a loss that's what's me oh
that's it it's cool to see how somebody
else does their makeup in the order that
they do yeah yeah everyone does it so
differently but we all have our things
like I get so tripped out if I try and
do it a different order like messes me
are like this isn't right yeah I'm just
gonna put that on the outer and inner
corner of my eye and I'm gonna leave a
space in the middle for one of these
gorgeous freakin gorgeous shades right
here from the G wait skinny-dip palette
that palette is just so beautiful to
look at to like it just blinds you by
looking at it I'm gonna do a little halo
like today I think I might go in and I
think I might do a cut crease ooh am i
over achieving right now let's see this
let's see I'm gonna go in with this
February I love it this one mm-hmm
probably mix it with that I'm just like
so it's not as bright yellow she did
such a good job with this palette
there's a really cute package it is
really keep acting super cute and the
colors just make you happy to look at
like that baby blue just was like so
pretty do I have a Canadian accent tell
me a little bit know when you say
certain words those are people tell me
but they never tell me what those
certain words are like I haven't said
you out about yeah right there that's
what it was about
yes that's so neat what do you say about
what you can actually I need some of the
Jackson Hale Paula he's really dark
brown down here it's got whatever you
could bring in the drama
it's got whatever you could possibly
need okay I'm making some progress but
it's very slow progress like very very
slow take your time doing right I'm
going in with like all the different
brushes I'm using a little bit here yeah
it's very exactly what I'm doing
um yours is coming along nice so
everything really pretty thank you
I feel like if I do a hollow eye my the
sunken in this of like my eyes like how
deep said it is it just gets accentuated
yeah so it looks literally like my eyes
are two little circles like protruding
out of my head so after my transition
shade I went in with that orange II know
I was the orange yeah I went on with
that Warren G Brown shade then I was
brown ended up mixing it with darker
Brown but now I'm going in with like
this
Brown here to deepen it up and that's a
color that's what we're here - all right
I'm gonna go into these you a skinny dip
palette where we're going in to skinny
dip right there I just want to show you
what it looks like on my finger oh I'm
trying to think what color I should do
unlike the lid lid the mobile lid the
moving lid but I could just also make me
sound pretentious so it's amazing thank
you and it's going on so nicely from
your finger okay so now I'm just gonna
cut my crease a little bit with my
foundation I'm just blending those edges
of the center shades and that may open
any harsh lines
you got a blend that crazy I forget how
we met how do I meet right I kind of
blanked on it yeah that's really crazy
like how did we actually mean was it an
even it must have been well we've never
met before this moment right here okay
now that's it and then you showed up at
my house and we just need you know you
know any people on line and it feels
like you know them in person yeah yeah
what if this was one of those like that
we're crazy now I feel like I've known
you for a really long time though so I
feel like I'm trying to think of like a
way back when but I honestly it wasn't
long ago that we met I know it wasn't I
just really want to remember you do like
I am me to a clue at all
it's embarrassing I'm gonna go in with
like this it looks almost like a rose
gold kind of color it's really pretty
this one you can't see but it's like
reflects gold no no yeah woah mm-hmm oh
that is pretty
I'm gonna spray my brush with fix+ to
really get more intense pigment usually
I'll do that with any kind of shimmery
shadow even though this palette is bomb
you probably don't really need to do
that but they're just really I actually
have been using the Loreal one
I don't know they're both really good
the the Loreal paradise you know I'm
talking about the new one yeah the one
that looks like the better than sex yeah
your mascara I haven't tried it yet
I'm so mad I haven't tried yet how is it
compared to the two-faced one um what
are you thinking why are you looking at
me like that
it's so pretty and I was just didn't
tell you it looks like you can really
see the golden e flow I told you but you
can't see on camera no but can you see
you can't see but it's like we're
realizing yeah I love it but I wish that
you could see on camera more I'd only
mean that's actually mad but I'm pretty
sure like we've probably watched each
other's videos which is why it felt like
we need to be reading each other okay we
figured it out
that's why we definitely met at
Coachella we just figured it out we met
at Coachella but it's because we watch
each other's videos for so long
beforehand we like felt like it was your
that yeah and I'm like okay now you're
stuck being friends with me you're stuck
