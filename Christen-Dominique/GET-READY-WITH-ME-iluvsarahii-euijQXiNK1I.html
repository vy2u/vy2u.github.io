keep watching I'm gonna try this your
print head um so Karen told me about
this primer right here I'm dr. Brandt
the Luminizer primer and this is gonna
fill in your pores but it's not going to
make your where she stays what happens
is sometimes silicone when you put that
onto your skin and you mix it in with a
good different like a water-based
moisturizer or something else you don't
mix together so they end up rolling up
and that's sometimes what happens I was
just Tony I'll put something on and then
I'll go like this and literally I'm like
what the heck and it's like rolls all
off of me so that's what happens when
you're mixing the wrong parts together
get a little bit of the h2o aqua defense
much as skin and essence as like mine I
got a juicer for it sprayed before
always I actually do my brows first I do
make my whole eye makeup first and then
mice can you do it the other way you do
your eye makeup and then your skin yeah
oh I do my foundation and then
my eye and then I go back to my side
yeah I'm too messy I don't know I do my
thought yeah I do my foundation but I
leave my concealer and like contour
later I'm gonna do a little bit of the
benefit browsing in the shade number two
it's like totally the wrong shade for me
but I drank make it work no I like it
because I my browser's look how dark my
browser girl yeah your browser like
blocked your browser dark eyes number
six now holy what mm-hmm
I brought three for you she's doing my
makeup on her channel so she brought
some stuff from UT I really really like
the way this feels it feels good right
pat pat pat I know you do this after a
little facial massage you know I'm so
into skin because I just have a really
bad skin oh really
when I was younger my skin was like I
went through everything from like having
like so much facial hair like Harry's
eyebrows ever - because yeah Lana Bobbi
wry laugh so I'm gonna use the Smashbox
Studios skin 15 hour today I'm going to
point three have used the Tarte
you have his under a boat its ass like
bouncy my brows take a very long time
that's why I never hardly do them on
camera I did him on camera freaking guys
last time cuz you requested it but I
usually do him off camera because he
takes so long my balls are so look at my
bra I mean I have no brows you should
see my brows in high school how bad they
were I tweeze out my eyebrows in high
school know middle school tweeze them
out - guys I used to fill them in with
the liquid liner oh my god we need to
put a picture up right now I have a
bitch I'm gonna I'll show you oh I'm
doing like a brow tutorial okay channel
the brows new okay huh hey cousin oh
this this is like you should show this
so you'd be like no no matter what level
you're at now you get to this for me you
know the only place I don't grow hair
cuz I'm really I'm hairy - is my
underarms
what uh-huh I don't like a girl like
Maureen I grow like three hairs I don't
ever have to shave what and if I shave
it's just like three hairs you're so
lucky
yeah but everywhere else it's hairy I
don't get it I
I have so much hair all over I'm
thankful for their on my eyelashes
they're her real lashes top and bottom a
lot of lash move on with this discovered
the kevin aiklen
skin central and number two to highlight
and wreath on my eyebrows I love this
stuff I'll probably never go through
this entire jar though yeah that's a lot
the last two years didn't cover up
tattoos with my consumer really I
haven't tried that one I'm gonna do the
shape tape from Tarte
always would you want a cup so backwards
it's so funny it's so cool to see how
people do their makeup we may personally
we're just saying that we're not gonna
switch from a shape tape until somebody
comes out with something better than
shape it has to be better even found
anything better than that before this
mine was Urban Decay Naked skin
NARS me like me me wait you mix them no
no first it was a NARS radiant creamy
and then I found Urban Decay Naked skin
and now this one mine was the long wear
Oh Matt that one with it I wish Mac
would switch it to a different style
container so because you end up leaving
that much at the bottom and then like it
goes to waste you know yeah and then
start from that one to nourish my
radiant
custard uh-huh to maybelline age rewind
really oh yeah it's so good that one's
like pro longwear and cuz end the
custard went together
oh don't I'm going to use my precisely
my brow pencil you know what I've been
using this huge mirror seven times
magnifying and you can see everything
and I get my browser's coming out so
much better now
oh yeah I have that little nice little
crazy look can you guys see how crazy
that is probably not I'm taking my Urban
Decay Eden primer potion put this all
over my lid I'm gonna take the persona
cosmetics palettes so does palette so
have the identity palette oh I got a
little mark on there it's such a pretty
palette though and it's super pigmented
I know it's one I'm gonna go in with
charming all over
my eyes already getting watery why the
last time she did my makeup was a long
time ago my I completely cried off
almost all of the eyeshadow I was like
dang it I'm gonna put this all over the
lid up into the crease have you tried
these new color pop press shadows so the
colors are really put your on now I want
to do that burgundy look they going with
the color pop shadows with just a little
bit
Smashbox for them first I'm gonna leave
an open space right on the center of my
lid so I can pop on like a really pretty
um shimmery shade I'm gonna darken up
the inner and outer part of the lid and
crease I'm taking in this light color
from the Smashbox one first it's a good
palette I know going in with this color
pop palette and these are their new
shadows they are magnetic and their
matte so I'm gonna go with this like
burgundy shade first and I don't know
what I'm doing when I make up I really
don't know what I'm doing with this
entire look in general so you're just
gonna play by ear and see kind of what
looks good oh my god you might forgot to
add on my coffee
what I forgot to add is press oh oh
dirty chai house expresso in it all
right dirty brisk a dirty shite is
espresso I know I say expresso too
should be here yeah how much you'd be
expresso what do you do with your makeup
tonight I'm gonna do a halo I'm gonna
take audacious and I'm gonna layer that
into the crease it's quite a regular
motion I've literally just used one
brush this entire time now the darker
burgundy shade and I'm gonna just I'm
gonna do it to my lashline first and
then smoke it up but I'm gonna keep the
inner part light Kristin what was your
first tutorial you ever did on YouTube

obsessed with I still really love your
Instagram but I was obsessed with you oh
I like you're here and we're I know okay
I'm gonna take gold digger and pop that
onto the lid he just took some more
burgundy with the clean brush and I'm
just going right over the color I just
apply it onto the lid
these are from geek face washes they're
cute they're really pretty lashes like a
$9 which isn't bad the reason I like
these like this style like straight
because VG winged liner it's going to
cut off and it's not going to give you
the end then if I have one as one of an
n then I will do we will end with that
sometimes you ever feel laner just like
covers like the work that you just do
yes yeah I'm not doing wing liner today

some eye cream this is a glimmer I
concentrate already dab some of this all
over my under eye I'm gonna now use a

underneath on my ice fur and then do my
bacon on top of that bronze or she let
me borrow this
it bronzer sunshine to come back form
I'm going to use my Make Up For Ever
foundation stick in five by we do it in
my contra force I wanna do that contour
my nose nose doesn't only do to spread
to these two over like you like 10 just
like go crazy with it
alright so instead of contouring first
I'm going to highlight first and then
contour I've been liking this better
because I feel like it just makes my
skin look so much better and stand out
more and I do less contour which is kind
of what I like taken in this Charlotte
Tilbury
