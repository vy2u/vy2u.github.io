ignore it I'm just gonna keep talking
hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today I decided to do this party glam
look right here I feel like I needed
glitter in my life I feel like I need a
little bit of party a little bit of
glitter without actually having to go to
a party so I put the party on my face
and created this look for you guys I
really I was just like honestly I was
dreaming about purple and bronze glitter
like glitter in some way shape or form
on my lids like I wanted this look so
bad I dreamt about it I'm going to be
trying out some new concealers today
these are from NARS these are the new
NARS soft matte complete concealers and
they are very full coverage I
highlighted I contoured I did a lot with
these this is going to be on my
favorites list just to let you know
right now these are very very good these
are the shades I used right here this
one is custard this one is canal and
then this last one is called dark 3 dark
coffee this is what I used to contour my
face today seven-thirty I really like
them they're full coverage very
lightweight it feels like your skin but
better so I'm gonna go ahead and show
you how I got this look on my face right
now but first what do you got to do be
sure to subscribe to my channel and hit
the notification bell before you leave
because you want to be a part of my
notification quad we are very cool over
here in the quad family anyways if you
want to learn how to get this look then
keep watching I already primed my face
I'm going to go ahead and put on some
foundation to my skin and today I'm
going to be using the Estee Lauder
Double Wear this is a new one so it's
very fresh I'm very excited because it's
clean blend it out with my Beauty
Blender first they're gonna make some
dots and then we'll blend it up
I actually did a video that is coming up
very soon with Karen and I love study
she did this technique where she used
concealer to draw a map out her brows
first and then went in with a brow
powder so I'm going to do that and try
that out and see how it works for me
today so I'm going to take one of the
new NARS soft matte complete concealers
and this was in the shade light 2.75
Pannell and this is one of those full
full coverage concealers this is the
kind of concealer I like to use to clean
up my brows and just to make everything
look flawless and clean so I'm just
going to take this brush right here and
I'm gonna map out my brows first see how
this works for me
Wow so that's how much brow I actually
need on my face in this concealer blends
out so easy okay so I'm just going to go
in with this little brush right here
shave and start to fill in my brows
and this brushing is so tiny almost
disappears because it's so narrow at the
end it's really really good it's super
precise I really like it you guys I'm
doing this from now on this is so
helpful I'm just going to cover up a
very lightly underneath the inner
corners I'm going to use the radiant
creamy concealer from NARS and this is
in macadamia medium 1.5 I'm going to use
that and it's just going to do a very
light coverage and I'm going to go back
in and use contour and a heavier
concealer once everything is done on the
eyes this is just doing a very light
conceal for us and it just brightens up
this area so nicely so I'm just going to
use that with my finger just work it in
there I'm going to go ahead and use the
shade light 2.75 the one I used on my
brows and I'm going to use this as a
primer all over my lids and just make
sure that the lid is in even color and
this is just going to create a really
nice even base for the shadows I'm
already so in love with this concealer
oh my god I love it so loud I'm gonna go
ahead and jump into the eyeshadow for
the eyeshadow I'm going to take my
morphe what is this 35n palette for
somebody's this shade right here just to
set the eyes all over it's going to do
the same thing that you would do for
your face it's going to set the creams
in place it's also going to make a
really smooth canvas for anything that
goes on top of it so it's going to be
able to blend so smooth especially with
this really
nice concealer underneath it just makes
everything look even better I'm going to
go in with this shade right here I'm
going to take that on the inner and
outer part of the eye
I want this to be in a very specific
precise area so I'm going to use a
smaller brush for this and I'm just
going to keep building up the color
flicking it outwards I'm going to start
to put it on the inner part of the outer
the inner part you have the inner part
of the eye sort of flick it outwards and
work it up into that inner crease I feel
like you just have a lot more control
over the brush in the shadow and how how
you really want it so just using a
smaller densely-packed brush is just a
lot easier okay so now I'm going to go
ahead and take this purple shade right
here though I'm going to go right on top
of the eyeshadow and just work it in
there so I want to take the eyeshadow up
and out so I feel like the purples on
there pretty light and airy and I'm
going to take this Brown that's right in
the center and I'm going to connect the
two into the crease so I'm going to
connect the crease right here just bring
it through through there okay so I'm
going to use a deeper purple so I'm
going to take this make a peak shadow in
curfew it's just a really nice matte
purple shade and then I'm just going to
work that on the inner and outer part
and just build up the intensity of the
purple so I'm going to do a little sure
circular motions okay so I'm going to go
ahead and take this shade right here
it's like an orange burnt orange color
I'm going to go ahead and take that on
my M 506 brush so I'm going to put it
right through the crease it's going to
give the eyeshadow like a glowing effect
now I'm going to go back with the brush
that we had curfew on and all those
Purple's
I'm going to take it straight through
the crease so just deepens up the crease
a bit more so what I'm going to do now
is pop on a bronzy glittery shade to the
center of my lid I'm going to first use
the dose of colors ideal duo loose
and primer this is in the shade shale
it's like a cream it's a little base for
your shadow okay so I'm going to go
ahead and pop that on with a morphe m43
two brush I'll pop that onto the center
of the lid and this is just going to be
our base until this is going to be a
really nice base because it has like a
tacky feel to it so now I'm going to go
ahead and take the pigment which is on
this side it's a really really pretty
pigment looks like that I want a little
bit more drama to the center of my lid
so I'm going to add a glitter so now I'm
going to take this adhesive this is a
glitter adhesive from violet balls I'm
just going to lightly Pat that on to the
center then I'm going to take this NYX
glitter face and body glitter it's
really pretty bronzy shade so then I'm
going to move on to my mascara I'm going
to use this one from Maybelline so I'm
gonna go ahead and take these lashes
from house of lashes and smoky Muse
eyelash glue lately this is from thrive
cosmetics it's really good like it will
not budge it might hurt a little when
you try to take it off to be honest but
honestly I don't mind because it's worth
it so now I'm going to get to concealing
and contouring for that I'm going to use
these NARS soft matte complete
concealers and there's 16 different
shades so you can contour highlight
whatever shade range your skin tone is
naturally you can definitely find a
concealer in your shade so I'm going to
use a few different ones for something
to conceal to do that I'm use medium one
Kuster I'm going to go ahead and work
that down and out okay yes this is
definitely going to be full coverage but
it does feel very soft and light on this
skin which is nice and I'm just gonna
work it into my skin with my finger just
to warm it up blend into the skin so
nice and easy and it doesn't look cakey
at all it looks like your skin I like
how this is full coverage but it still
looks very natural and still looks like
my skin but
it covered up my dark circles so good
I'm a really impressed with this
concealer because it literally went
melted into my skin and it's like my
skin like you can't detect that I have
concealer on right now I think I love it
guys we're so excited I found a new good
feeler so I'm gonna go ahead and use
dark coffee for my contour shade I'm
going to start right here by my
cheekbones and my hairline and I'm just
gonna sit down it blends into your skin
so easy it's super creamy nose is
snatched okay so now I'm just going to
bake my under eyes I'm going to take
this cover effects from system powder
work my Beauty Blender in there and here
start at the corner bring it over and
this is just so it doesn't crease so I'm
just going to let that sit for a little
bit and while that's working there I'm
going to do my lower lash line so I'm
going to go ahead and take that shade
that we used earlier in our crease load
up my brush and start to work that on
the lower lash line and just having that
translucent powder there is going to
make doing anything on top of it super
easy and make it look really full
lawless okay now that we have that
lightly shaded underneath I'm going to
take a more densely packed brush this is
the disc colors flat definer and really
just pack in that purple color I want
the lashes to stand out so I'm going to
go ahead and pack on the purple I'm
actually just going to leave it right in
there I'm not going to take it all the
way in I'm going to go back in with that
brush we used with the Lauren g brown
shade I'm going to go ahead and go
underneath just to buff out the edges
here I think we're pretty good on the
eyes I'm just going to wipe off the
excess powder that I have going on right
here and now I'm going to move on to the
bronze room and add some warmth to my
face I'm going to take this Milani
bronzer XL all
blow I'm going to go ahead and buff that
into my skin just like on the outer
perimeter to give our skin some warm so
I'm going to use these blushes right
here from their from a morphe blush
palette and I'm going to take this shade
in the corner and a little bit of this
one I'm going to bring it up along the
temple do the same thing on this side
the highlight I'm going to use this
press pigment it from morphe it's the
mimosa Sunday I thought it would be
really pretty along the cheeks and I'm
just going to take some of that and pop
it like it just be pretty to pop on
right on the art I just blend it out
with my finger just to soften it up a
little bit and then on the lips I'm just
going to take this nude lip liner from
Maybelline it's called magnetic mauve
I'm going to take this pure Velvet Matte
lip color in the shade innocent little
bit darker than I was expecting
and I'm going to go over the top with
the Geoffrey stars I'm nude
I end up putting like eight different
things on my lips I want them to be a
little more glossy so I found this Mary
Kay at play jelly lip gloss and teddy
bear and I'm just going to top that off
on the center
