oh hey guys welcome back to my channel
so today we are going to blind all the
haters with this super super glowy
spring makeup look I definitely did not
intend on this book being as colorful
but it ended up working out pretty well
I usually don't use that much color
because of my face shape the face is
really small and just right here this is
my face like Boba my cat so I can't use
a lot of color on my eyes or it looks
like really really crazy so I used it in
every other way possible it's not like
crazy taking over our whole entire eye
it's super wearable and if you're afraid
of color it's a test out to the waters
and to see how you like the color on
your face so I am using the Natasha Dona
tropic palette in this video I loved it
so much but why is it so expensive oh my
gosh this is super expensive but I got
it in my PR package so I'm very happy
about that I'm gonna show you how to
really intensify that glow from
underneath your makeup so keep watching
for that and if you want to see how I
got this look right here this very fun
spring the super glowing to the gods
look then just keep watching but before
you go don't forget to subscribe to my
channel and hit that notification mouse
need to be a part of the quad family and
without further I know I still have that
bite so ugly and without further ado
let's get on with the video alright so I
already did my brows I have a very dry
face there's nothing on my face right
now so I'm going to hydrate it with this
hoola Henriksen C rush brightening gel
cream it's supposed to be a 24 hour gel
cream I've been using this as you can
see I'm almost out of it I've been using
this for about a month
first of all if you love citrusy cents
you're going to adore this it just
reminds me of a creamsicle it just
smells so yummy
this feels so different from anything
I've ever tried I really like it I feel
like it really gets into the skin it
doesn't clog my pores that plump supple
feeling lasts all day it really does and
I love to use this underneath my makeup
this helps with fine lines wrinkles and
this is anti pollution so it's gonna
help with all the debris dirt and just
pollution that we're surrounded by every
day it's gonna protect our skin from
that so that makes me feel so much
better and I like the color of it too it
gives you like a brightening effect
right away and it just makes your skin
just look and feel so glowy and supple
I'm gonna go ahead and let that dry down
and put some banana bright underneath my
eyes this has that yellow color
correcting tone to it so it does truly
brighten help brighten this area without
applying makeup on to the under eye I've
ended up not having to use as much
makeup because of this cream so the
foundation on my knees today is the elsi
micro silk foundation in the shade of
vanilla and I just use this random cap
to put my foundation on I find any
object that I can put my foundation on
just so that I don't get dirty I used to
do it all the time I just put it on my
hand and they'd get it everywhere I'm
just gonna do a very light layer this so
before I start my eye shadow I'm gonna
go in with the revolution conceal and
define which I have heard is very
comparable to the Tarte shape tape now
I'm gonna move on to the eyes which is
the fun part for me when I think of
spring I think of colorful soft pastels
bright shades I get so excited and I
want to just test out all these colors
when it comes to springtime so luckily I
got this in my PR package this is Athena
Tasha to known a tropic palette and
first of all the packaging is really
really cute I love the bright colors it
has a humungous mirror like the size of
my face basically whoa
do you see that that is crazy watch whoa
I'm gonna go in with pastel melon this
is so pretty I love the shade names to
then just pop that all over the eye it's
actually a lot darker than what I
expected so I'm just gonna
go on the lid in just above the crease
so I'm not gonna go all the way up to
the brow bone
and then with my Mac to two 1's brush
I'm going to take fake tan right here
and Sahara mix those guys together work
him right into the outer crease I'm just
gonna use a little short quick back and
forth motions all around the outer V and
I'm not pressing down too hard so it's
pretty light hand that I'm using I'm
gonna extend it all the way out to the
end of the the tail and come in so I can
elongate the eye it just makes it look
more sultry and exotic I'm gonna take
peach puff right here and a little bit
of nudist and I'm gonna take them on the
outer half of the eye with a fluffy
brush and just circular motions work
that on the outer half I'm gonna flip my
brush over so I can hit any edges that
are a little too harsh and just a zigzag
my brush down the edge on the inner half
of the eye I'm gonna take a pastel melon
and Pat that on right in there I'm gonna
do a liner so I'm gonna take Xena right
here and just add a little bit more
color on the liner I'm gonna take
Tigerlily and go right below the liner
but I'm not gonna wing it out I'm just
gonna keep it low great about there
for the inner corners I'm going to go in
with this shade right here for the lower
lash line I'm going to take this purple
right here we're just so colorful in
this video underneath the purple I'm
going to do the blue again and I'm gonna
put that very close to the lower lash
line
and then right below the blue I'm gonna
take Coco which is a matte Brown so we
can give this look a little bit more
depth I'm gonna take this fluffy brush
and just pinch it and go back and forth
I'm gonna go ahead and do this nude
liner right here from essence oh right
on the waterline and then I'm gonna put
some mascara on this is the Thrive
liquid lash extensions and brynn it's a
rich black like so so I got this in my
PR package I've never heard of this
brand before but the packaging really
caught my eye and then when I opened the
lashes they looked really really nice
kind of remind me of Lilly lashes these
are called Queen okay so I have my
lashes on but I honestly I don't know
how I feel about this liner or something
to go in with this other liner from le
grill it's called aquatic and I'm just
gonna line up right on the waterline now
I'm gonna go in with some concealer the
new concealer that I got from revolution
you
man this concealer covers really really
well I would even like do contour with
the concealer but I'm gonna go ahead and
do the powder contour and set my under
eyes so I'm going to use this Laura
Mercier brightening powder it's a it's
called the secret brightening powder for
under eyes so go ahead and use my shade
in light contour palette right here and
I'm gonna take this shade in the middle
and just go right under the cheekbone
pop those cheekbones out
all right so contoured about all the
extra powder off of my under eyes now
I'm going to use the new newly packaged
Too Faced chocolate bronzer it almost
reminds me of like a Reese's Peanut
Butter Cup I don't know I really like
chocolate as you can tell and then I'm
just oh my god that just got in my mouth
and I kind of liked it I was going to go
in with some blush but I'm gonna skip on
the blush I like the way the bronzer
looks on its own but I'm gonna kind of
blend it out right here
so it's not like great for the highlight
I'm gonna go with the artist Couture
Illuminati diamond glow powder look at
this new packaging artist Couture is now
actually in Sephora which is amazing
congratulations to Angel macdaddy on
Instagram so proud of you the diamond
glow powder czar so pretty can use them
as highlights you can use them on your
eyes they're just gorgeous so I'm gonna
go ahead and pop this one we are not shy
about our highlight here I really want
this to be a very glowy luminous look
it's so pretty you can even make it more
intense if you want by adding some fix+
but I'm just gonna keep it kind of baked
it's actually not basic at all but I'm
gonna keep it pretty subtle I put it on
my nose go down the center and on the
lips every time I use this I would just
want to go everywhere else so they don't
want to go here here here everywhere and
since this is actually a very glowy look
it's supposed to be a very glowy look so
I'm actually gonna go right underneath
the brow bone with this tube right in
here now we're going into the lips I'm
gonna take this Marc Jacobs lipliner in
slow burn and line the edge
take this NYX butter gloss and Sunday
mimosa and just go right in this Center
once I'm dying it to give me that extra
glowy finish I'm gonna take the mac
mineralize charge the water and we're
done thank you guys for watching I hope

it go ahead and give me a big thumbs up
