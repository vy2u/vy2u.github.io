not a gangster anytime I see her face
she just makes me smile sometimes I
can't find it but what I do
it makes me hey guys welcome back to my
channel so today I'm going to be turning
myself into a gangster clown my friend
Krispy actually did this amazing epic
gangster clown mini movie trailer and it
is amazing only get below that she has
movie in it so I'm in that and I was
like okay let me just do a last-minute
Halloween costumes I'm going to be cool
a few other girls did it too so you can
check there because I'll have linked
them below if you want to learn how to
get this last-minute Halloween costume
thank you for watching okay I'm gonna
get my little cockroach strands out of
my hair this is literally me in fifth
grade I had these right here I always
had my hair in a ponytail and I'd have
it down my back like I'm gonna go ahead
and put these little guys back put on
this foundation right here from
hourglass it's the foundation stick
haven't been nice to it I'd like every
time I try to put on the cap I like try
to put it on way too fast and that ends
up getting everywhere it is a really
good full coverage foundation it's like
quickest on-the-go foundation that's
full coverage and you know your skin's
gonna look so good if you just swipe it
just a few times
finally got my color right I was using a
really dark one at first I this is the
shade nude
I'm going to go ahead and put on some of
my concealer this is the Tarte shaped
tape concealer and light media I'm just
going to put some of that on my under
eyes
so now I'm going to set my foundation so
I'm going to take my Urban Decay
foundation powder and in a fair cool I'm
taking a little bit of a lighter color
because I feel like this is like a sort
of a clown chola but she's more
realistic you know what I'm going to
take the Too Faced chocolate Soleil and
medium matte bronzer and you know this
set - this is intense it's like an
intense chocolatey scent which I'm not
I'm not mad about but it was just like
it hit me in the face I'm going to go
ahead and work that into my cheeks now
I'm going to go ahead and contour I just
feel like when you bronze and then
contour your contour looks a lot more
smooth and I'm going to take my shade
and light palette from Kat Von D the
lightest shade and start to contour my
cheekbone it's intensify that hollow so
that our face can look a little bit more
slimmer I'm going to take my JD the Luxy
182 brush and use it to contour my nose
a little bit right at the end we're
going to go ahead and jump into the eye
makeup I'm going to be using this is the
TARDIS Pro the new TARDIS Pro palette
from Tarte duck I am so excited that
they came out with an eye shadow palette
because I love tarts um everything
honestly I use everything from them in
all my videos in a lot of my daily
makeup so the fact that they made an
entire color palette for your eyes I was
just so so so happy
all of these eyeshadows are super
pigmented it's insane actually came back
from Bora Bora with Tarte and that's
what they kind of showed us this new
palette and they also have a glow
palette which is a highlighting palette
and you are gonna die when you put your
hands on one of these guys you are
literally going to melt because the eye
it's super pigmented so anyways I'm
gonna go ahead and dip into this palette
for my eyes today so I'm going to go
ahead and pick up innocent and chic then
i take my morphe m44 one brush and start
to work that into the crease this is
just our transitions transition
transition shade going to wash that onto
the crease now I'm going to go ahead and
take classic right here and take classic
and my zoom yvette 234 brush and it will
work this onto the lid I'm just going to
pack that on I'm also going to put a
little bit of this underneath the brow
bone just to make it pop out a little
bit more gonna take edgy which is this
one right here and take edgy and I'm
going to pop that onto the crease I'm
actually going to use this m-more Thiam
5:07 brush so I just want to get a nice
subtle definition in my face and I'm
going to take this brush right here it's
the morphe m4 one - I'm going to take a
little bit more of that smoked and just
start to work it on the outer part and
then for my liner I'm going to use the
bomb Schwing liner this is the liner
that I've been using every single day
lately I just is one of those liners
that I use a lot and then I stopped
using it and then I'm like okay now I
know why I used it and I don't know why
yourself okay so now I'm going to put on
some mascara on my lashes I'm going to
go ahead and put some shadow on the
bottom lash line - so I'm going to take
the same colors we use innocent cheek
just start to work out on the bottom
lash line and then I'm going to go ahead
and pop on some lashes I'll be back and
we're going to do the face okay so now
I'm going to do the little clown marks
lines with my eyeliner
so since this is so black I'm going to
fill in my brows with a black I am black
eye shadow and also I'm just going to
clean this up a little bit because I
feel like one side is a lot thinner than
the other one so I'm just going to make
this one a little bit thicker I'm going
to still take the eyeliner and just put
two little dots a little square right a
square I know I put a little triangle
right under this eye and then on this
side I'm going to draw a little teardrop
for the lips I'm going to take stone for
math and outline my lips it's super easy
you're going to be like that's it but
really it doesn't take much to do this
and I'm going to go ahead and pick up
this cos Mahal like a lip I'm actually
going to go ahead and take a black liner
so I'm going to take this black eyeliner
from Lancome's reminds me of my first
video right now when I did my first
video I literally used an eye liner to
do my lips because that's all I had
and this blush is from NYX it's the
coral dream lotions now pop it onto the
outer part of my cheeks a lot poop I'm
