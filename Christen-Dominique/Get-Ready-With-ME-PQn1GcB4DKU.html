back to my channel so today I'm going to
be doing a get ready with me for you
guys and this is kind of like what I do
before summer hits I prepare my skin I
test out different makeup looks for the
summer so this is kind of like what I'm
doing and I have a bunch of new stuff
too that I want to try out oh my god by
the way you guys these lips are
absolutely amazing and perfect for the
summer I don't like stain lips I never
have I don't like the way it feels on my
lips I usually feels like it's not
supposed to be on your face until I saw
these guys from colour-pop the blotted
lips and the ultra blotted lips I have
it on right now and I am obsessed with
it it looks like you just ate a popsicle
and it's this is the remainder of the
popsicle on your lips it's so pretty and
I'm also showing you how to get a nice
color going before the summer stars a
nice glow so don't be scared
because the next clip is me in the
shower welcome to my rest room since
it's almost summer time I also wanted to
include this step into my routine
because I do do this everyday or every
time I take a shower after I wash my
body and rinse off I turn off the shower
and I grab my Jergens natural glow wet
skin moisturizer I can be a little lazy
I'm not going to lie so I do as much as
possible while I'm in the shower
what this does is it boys Rises my skin
at the same time it's going to give me
an all-over even blow it's super easy
and then I just walk out of the shower
and dry off as I normally would the cool
thing is that it doesn't get on your
clothes or transfer onto your towels and
it isn't a self-tanner and some
moisturizers that give you a gradual
natural looking color every time you use
it and you'll start to see the color in
like 3 or 5 days so it's super easy you
don't have to think about it too much
it's not messy at all and then after
this I just brush my teeth apply my face
cream and then I start to get my face
ready for the day and let's walk into my
Beauty room
all right so now it's time to do my
makeup for the day I have some new stuff
in front of me so I think I'm going to
use just all the new stuff that I've
gotten my PR packages so I'm gonna do my
brows first because I like to do them
when they're dry and clean them up it
doesn't get like mixed in with a
foundation or anything summoning is that
our austalia pomade in Ebony and I'm
going to work that in with a blink brow
and liner duo brush love this brush so
so much is my favorite brow brush ever
it works so well on either brow hairs it
just pulls around hairs up so I'm gonna
go ahead and take this guy right here
this is the pomade from Australia and
I'm going to just start to fill in my
brows I'm going to start back here back
by the tail end and then I like to brush
through just comb through the hair so it
doesn't clump up in any spots wow you
can really tell how bald my eyebrows are
I try to stay away from the areas where
they have a lot of hair and just keep it
on the sparse areas this pomade is very
strong and it will make any area that
you put it on super bold if you have
full brows and you're just trying to
make them even I would go in with a brow
brush but I just I like using this just
a little bit faster for me I'm gonna go
ahead and film some primer I thought
this was really interesting I got this
in a PR package it's called j1 jelly
pack basically it's called the
foundation glue and supposed to feel
like really tacky on your skin meaning
your foundation because to stick to your
skin like crazy
it says dramatic firming skin with
improved elasticity and poor smoothing
but the package that I got said
foundation glue so I was really curious
to try this out and he actually had an
Elmer's glue inside the package which I
thought was really cute and actually
gave it to my son I'm going to go ahead
and try this out and see how this works
oh it does look like glue that's what it
looks like look at that oh that looks
wrong it's like tacky so I wanna try it
I hope it doesn't mess up oh this is
weird
my screws to do it like that imagine if
I was putting glue on my face right now
and I had no idea no I'm sure they
wouldn't
do that it's very tacky like it my skin
my foundation is probably not going to
move is either making me feel like I'm
going to have our time blending this out
onto my face because it's so tacky
but yeah let's just go with it let's see
what is that it's weird it's really
really weird these are the new tart clay
stick foundations it supposed to be very
similar to the Amazonian clay foundation
which I really really love it's
completely full coverage feels really
great on the skin almost feels like it
fills in all your pores it does really
great things so this is supposed to be
just like that but in a stick so I'm
going to try medium neutral yeah medium
mutual night-work apply it to my face on
top of this really sticky glue-like
primer
wish me luck you guys let's try this out
it's gliding on pretty nice let's go
ahead and work that into the face I'm
just going to pack it in there pack it
into my skin wow it actually looks
really good and natural the foundation
feels really comfortable on the skin and
I don't feel the primer anymore
which is good but it definitely feels
like that primer is going to last me all
day
looks like tart shape tape is going to
be our concealer as well that's just our
go to go light medium then do a little
bit of highlighting cut it in with a
Beauty Blender and then we'll work it
onto my lid that tan deep honey works
really good as a contour stick
this is a 3d HD Beauty fund from Sigma
and just going to Pat that contour in if
you guys happen to be shopping on Sigma
or want to get this little guy I have a
Co you can use for discount
I'll have it below for you guys I'm also
going to put some right on my crease
right here now I'm going to go ahead and
move on to my eyes for my eyes I'm going
to be using this Carli bybel palette
from BH Cosmetics this is the 21 color
eyeshadow in a highlighter palette it
looks like this it is so so beautiful
it's like marble I'm still impressed
with you shadows today I'm going to go
ahead and get into this guy right here
I'm going to work him all over the
crease and I think what I want to do is
do like a halo eye today just taking a
fluffier brush so that we can blend out
the edges and this is a clean blending
brush so you're not moving that shape
further out you're just keeping it where
it is in cleaning up the edges I'm
actually going to start to work this
shade right here so for that I'm just
going to take one of these flat shader
brush as a weeba 234 brush so I'm going
to grab that shade right here I'm going
to pack it on to the inner and outer
part of the lid so I want to keep that
Center open so I can add a really pretty
highlight follow the crease so these
Browns are really pretty okay I'm going
to go in with this shade right here this
one right here
oh so pretty it's like a pinky pearly
champagne I'm just going to follow that
Center highlight in the light is
actually naturally bouncing off of my
center of my lid so that's what I'm
going to go off of and as I go I'm just
going to deepen up the intensity of the
inner and outer corner so I'm going to
go back and forth into that brown just
connecting the two sides I'm going to go
in with that clean fluffy brush and just
soften elf edges on my eyelid I'm only
really using those two colors that
transition shade that you see around it
looks like a little halo a little
glowing halo and then I'm just going in
with that one Brown shape softening it
and cue the edges of that highlight
then when I get to the crease the outer
crease I'm really just packing it in
there
and concentrating it right in that area
so I get more intensity there so I'm
only using one color for this because of
the way I'm using it it looks like I'm
using more than one color and then for
the brow bone I'm going to take this
matte bone color right here I'm going to
use a heart brush right here this is
from the unicorn collection and start to
pack it on to the brow bone and then I'm
just going to blend out the edges of
these this really bright white shade
right here and pop that onto the inner
corner now I'm going to go ahead and go
in with a gel liner in just a sec I'll a
gel liner and brown for the wing I'm
going to go ahead and take this brush
right here this is the Sigma bent liner
brush BB 12 I've never drawn to using
brushes like this so this brush is
pretty new for me so for that mascara
I'm going to use the Tarte lifted
mascara and it's like a black brown
shade I'm just going to work that on our
lashes so I'm going to put lashes on
right now so so I'm going to go into my
waterline with this Coco shade from Marc
Jacobs and then I'm going to smudge it
out alright so I'm going to add some
some eye shadow on the lower lash line
as well I'm going to take that Brown
that we used earlier so this is going to
be a really nice transition from our
little smudgy that we created these are
just Samantha number seven lashes from
Buddha hooda so I'm just going to put
the black mascara on the tips of the
lower one well I'm really liking to new
Beauty lashes so length the style is so
so nice and then what I'm going to do
just to add a pop of color I'm going to
add this Mac green mascara this is in no
pain no gain
oh that is bright especially for this
summer as a pop of color without having
to actually put eyeshadow on your eyes
at colors I connect them and go in with
liquid highlight so I'm going to use
this Marc Jacobs do you do drop it's a
coconut gel highlighter looks like this
i swatched it and it
is gorgeous it's a liquid gold basically
this is a drop I've done I just made
that up so I'm going to go ahead and set
my under eyes I'm actually going to use
the naked skin powder I'm going to take
my morphe e49 brush in this powder right
here I'm going to look up because I
don't want to get any creases under my
eyes and see how this it's not as bright
as I like it to be but I actually am
building it up it does make your skin
look really soft I'm going to go on with
this bronzer it's a new browser from LC
cosmetics it's in the shade medium I
love Matt bronzers like so I'm going
with that bold highlight from the Carli
bybel palette this one right here and
now I get to top this all over my face
look at that highlight so I wanted to
use these new color pop blotted lips
they have these guys and they also have
and the Ultra blotted lip let's see what
he looks like
this is bee's knees it's a little bit
dry but stains aren't supposed to be
moisturizing at all so I'm gonna go
right on top with this I'm just going to
go right in the center
I like how color pop doesn't only come
out with a ton of different shades but
different formulas that haven't used
this yet this is from benefits the
California blush gives a little pop of
pink Oh before I go I'm going to set
with the new morphe prep and set makeup
setting spray I also have a discount
