kidding and that's how it would sound if
I started a Spanish camp hi everyone
welcome back to my channel so today I am
doing this everyday makeup look I got a
lot of requests off of this Instagram
picture so I decided to make a video for
you guys so if you want to know how I
got it keep watching so first I'm going
to start off with a moisturizer I'm
using the Eco Beauty la fresh good day
Jay boy stur Iser how cute is this
little packaging this is going to be my
moisturizer today usually I use the
benefit one but I'm going to try this
one out what feels good I like one of
moisturizer isn't when it's thick
because I feel like it really gets into
your skin and it also lasts longer I'm
grabbing my Tia Dora body lotion that I
got my Ipsy glam bag because my hands
are super dry and I don't want you guys
to see my hands any drier than what they
are right now
now that our skin is nice and
moisturized I'm going to use the Laura
Mercier primer and this is just gonna
even our skin surface I can open it the
answer to slip like slippery okay come
on open it for me
today I'm going to try out the cargo CC
cream and this is in medium and I
haven't even opened this yet but I had
it lying around in my storage and
decided to use it today for the first
time okay so when you blend it in that's
when the color activates oh yeah I see
what it's doing there's not really much
coverage with this so I kind of feel
like I want to just mix it with my
Smashbox foundation to add some coverage
this is the Smashbox this studio skin
and you know what I'm going to add a
little bit of this manic Adarsh sheer
glow shimmer lotion into it just to give
me a little bit of a glow that was my
phone yeah that feels better so it
doesn't feel as thick even though I have
three different things going on products
but it still covers then I have a little
bit of a glow in there with the manic
Adar sheer glow and then um no no just
looks really nice sometimes you I like
to experiment with my foundations and my
creams you never know what you can
create with it so this this looks pretty
good this eye it's always redder this
eye is more red than the other one like
right on the lid for some reason
so next I'm going to cover these
under-eye circles today I'm using the
Urban Decay Naked skin weightless
complete coverage concealer I'm really
excited to try this and this is in the
color light neutral check it out I
always like to apply concealer right
just below under a circle I remember
when I first started putting on
concealer I'd put it I put the concealer
right where the dark spot was so it
looked like a reverse raccoon eye it was
past terrible so I try to go a little
bit lower than the actual under-eye area
I'm going to let my foundation and
concealer dry and I'm going to start on
my brows I'm actually going to do that
off camera if you guys want to see a
separate video for that let me know in
the comments below the routine is pretty
much the same every time so let me know
if you want to see that I will be right
back to lock in my foundation and
concealer I'm going to use my Smashbox
powder I'm gonna make mainly focus this
around the eye like everywhere but the
eye area I like to keep that pretty
bright and then to add some coverage to
my under eyes and brighten them as well
be using the hello flawless by benefit
and this is in champagne
now for my favorite part contouring I
feel like this is a definite must part
of this is definitely part of my
foundation routine I always start off
with the bronzer if I'm doing like an
everyday look just to warm up my face
and then I grab my contour color and
start to define my cheekbones by just
tracing the bottom of my cheekbone or
you can even go a little higher if you
want higher to the bones and then
flipping the brush over to the clean
side just start to sweep the color
upwards towards the temples to blend it
out now I'm just going to contour my
nose I'm going to run the contour color
along the sides of my nose to straighten
it and then on the front just to make it
look a little bit more rounded we're
going to before I go any further I'm
going to use the Malin and gets mojito
lip balm to smooth out my lips I've been
kind of dry lately with this weather
change so soothing I always like to have
a good lip balm in my purse I think this
is going to be a new throw in the bag
alright so now we're going to move on to
the eyes and today I'm going to be doing
a very natural everyday look usually I
do this look whenever I want to wear a
little bit of makeup on the weekend but
it's never too heavy so this is very
natural looking for me it's pretty
pretty much every day I'm going to be
using this Tarte lip palette to do that
on the weekends I grab this one because
it has all the neutral colors in it and
so I'm going to lay down the first color
with a shadow brush and this is going to
be free spirit I like to have the more
yellowy tones on my lids I don't like it
to look too bright so lay this color
down first
where the crease I'm just going to wash
on force of nature with a small blending
brush this is the 224 from zoeva
so next I'm picking up a dreamer and I'm
going to lay that down right along the
crease to add more definition
and to soften the edges I'm just going
to turn the brush over to the clean side
and then blend it upwards just like I
did with the contour brush
so I'm next I'm going to add some
definition to the lower half of the
bottom lashline I'm going to use dreamer
the same color we use to accentuate the
crease I'm going to use it for the
bottoms to for the brow bone highlight
I'm going to use this matte bone color
it's the same color we used on our lid
and I'm just going to apply that to the
brow bone and work it down into the
other colors for the inner corner
highlight I'm going to use my mary-lou
manizer and I'm just going to pop that
on to the inner corners with a pencil
brush I'm going to use the same
highlighter to highlight the tops of my
cheekbones and down the bridge of my
nose I'm going to use the Elizabeth ma
all-over shadow brush just to apply my
highlight to the bridge of my nose since
it's a smaller area next I'm going to do
a winged liner using the Schwing liner
from the balm and then my favorite
eyeliner dries out so I pick up my muir
nice I haven't used this one yet and I'm
just going over what I've already done
in to sharpen the tail end and just
taking my concealer brush and leaning it
up then we're going to apply a few coats
of mascara and move on to the lashes but
this doesn't mean that you have to put
lashes on for an everyday look you can
definitely skip this part but I think it
just accentuates the look the ones that
I'm using there from foxy locks list
them below so you can check them out and
I'm just going to pop them on really
quick and I will be right back
and I am completed with the I look I
like it do you like it give me a thumbs
up if you do now we're going to move on
to the lips and for the lipliner I'm
going to use my favorite lip liner right
now it's nude from NYX
for the lipstick I'm using the Gerard
cosmetics in buttercup and I just laid
it on top and next I'm going to pick up
the Kaelyn pure last extreme matte tint
in narcissist and lightly apply that
over the lipstick to give it a nice
matte finish so now I'm going to put on
some blush today I'm using the sugar
bomb blush from benefit and just looks
like this I like it because it's it has
like a warm peachy pink color to it and
it goes really nice with the eyeshadow
and this is the final look I hope you
