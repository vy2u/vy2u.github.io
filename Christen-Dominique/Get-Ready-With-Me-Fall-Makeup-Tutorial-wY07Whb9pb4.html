woke up put my hair up sat down in this
chair today I'm gonna be doing it get
ready with me from start to finish
I literally just finished brushing my
teeth washing my face had these on for a
while and these are in case you guys are
wondering because I went to sleep like
really late last night these are the
Tarte pack your bags
nine-one-one under eye rescue patches
they are even better if you put them in
the fridge amazing so I've had these on
for a while now so I'm going to take
them off I haven't done one of these
videos in a very long time you like my
coffee mug I normally with like a get
ready with me I would it up and show you
making my coffee but this is literally
my last video in my apartment that I'm
living in now I move next week so I have
boxes everywhere it's not pretty so I'm
like okay I'm just gonna do a chatty get
ready with me because I cannot take you
through my entire routine but I can
promise you where I'm moving is gonna be
a lot prettier a lot brighter so much so
much light is going to be coming into
the house I'll be using my space so much
more in the mornings whenever I wash
after I wash my face I put on this
moisturizer from Estee Lauder it's the
clear difference and this is my daytime
moisturizer because it's very light I
just put that on it has a good cooling
effect to it next I'm going to put on
some under eye cream I've been using
this one and it's a light in air eiu 's
this as my daytime cream this is called
the restore C revitalizing eye cream and
so I put underneath my eyes like this
it's very very light and then before I
start I put on like a lip moisturizer
I've been using this one from Erin
it's called rose lip conditioner really
liked it so it looks like this comes out
like that and it's kind of thick and I
just washed ur eyes my whole entire face
before I start my makeup just to let you
guys know I'm going to be using my Ipsy
glam bag in this video I have this
actually came in the glam bag this is
the tarte maracuja oil you can put this
on your face you can put it on your hair
your lips supposed to help brighten your
skin moisturize make it look firm
actually put this in my hair sometimes -
if I have flyaway or another thing you
can use this for and don't have makeup
wipes you can use this on a napkin and
just wipe your makeup away it just melts
off your face I like this this is cute
it's a little sample size of the pore
fessional
looks like so this is from benefit I'm
going to put that on my t-zone because I
I feel like I have a lot of big pores
there I used to break out a lot in that
area fills in the pore so it makes it
look like one flat even surface next
this was in the glam bag and I'm not
just saying this because it's in the
glam bag but literally my skin gets so
dry during this time a month this is
from delectable hand cream by cake
beauty it's in sweet mint and cream and
it's just a non greasy kind of formula
makes your skin feel super hydrate I'm
putting that on because I really am
super super drugged let's go on to the
makeup wear foundation today I'm uses la
girl pro coverage HD foundation in the
shade nude beige I'm going to take some
of that on my hand and I'm going to take
my Tarte sponge and work that on my face
I use this in one of my last videos and
I really like the coverage on it I am
using it again to do and it's affordable
- it's not super expensive and I'm a
really picky about my foundation so this
is a really good one if you're looking
for a full coverage lightweight
foundation and you don't want to spend a
ton of money on it
the LA girl is really really good this
is from Tarte this sponge
you don't actually wet this sponge you
just use it as is and it works really
good my favorite part I don't know if
it's just me I have a lot of
discoloration around my eyes so whenever
I get to my eyes and they turn from red
to like skin tone color I'm like I get
so happy it's the little things and then
this side for the inner corner fat in
your foundation because you don't want
it to be smeared around everywhere you
won't get very much coverage that way so
make sure you pat in I didn't go too
heavy around the under eye area because
I'm gonna put concealer there and I
don't want it to look super cakey I've
been using this ever since I got it and
I just can't stop
this little guy I use pretty often cream
contour kit from a Velvet 59 as you can
see I use it I'm going to take my morphe
r32 brush and I'm going to take that
light contour shade and just go
underneath my cheekbone right here and
she create that shadow same thing on
this side go right alongside my nose I
like this brush because it's not too big
it's not too small it's perfect this is
a really good one I'll just blend
upwards and take these two shades and
I'll go down my nose like that right not
up I'm going to go ahead and move on to
the eye shadow this is the new palette
from Tarr I'm going to take this color
right here
this is classic I'm going to use that
all over my eyelid I'm just so that we
can neutralize the aisle and have
everything sit really nice and pretty on
top of the lid so I'm just going to take
my brush and sweep it over and get the
inner corners really good I'm going to
do some war red tones so I'm going to
take mod which is this red shade right
here and I like that this palette is all
matte and then they separated in circles
the glam shimmery shade so I'm going to
take my paper blending brush from luxe
ISA 229 I'm going to put that into my
crease just buff it in there okay so
after I put that all around my eyes and
then I'm going to go in with drama which
is this plummy purple shade right here
and just go right into the crease the
same areas that I put the red but just
bringing it down a little bit lower so
all around the eye I'm going to take it
into the inner corner right here just
like dot it like that and windshield
wiper motions and then I'm going to go
ahead and take it around and I'm
building up the color around the inner
and outer corners of the eyelid
I'm taking a clean brush and I'm just
blending on the edges pulling the color
out and fading it up into the brow bone
I'm going to put on the lid color I'm
going to take ethereal just this shade
right here this I'm going to take my
zoeva 234 brush and I am going to pick
up cereal you're going to work that on
to the lid
and then on the outer parts of my eye
I'm going to take Punk which is this
matte black color and I'm going to use
my SL miss glam Beauty w20 angled eye
brush and this is good for getting into
the crease so I'm going to take that the
outer and inner parts of the crease I'm
also going to touch just a little bit
with the with the pointy side of the
brush I'm going to touch the inner
corner of the eye I'm actually adding a
little bit of blam on top of a cereal
because it's a little bit lighter so I'm
going into the top and just packing that
on so I get the most of the product so
I'm just going to Pat it I'm also going
to take the black and go on the lower
lash line here bring it around like so
and for my waterline I'm going to take
the zoeva black to earth graphic
eyeliner pencil and I'm gonna line my
waterline pretty heavy so now I'm going
to go in with some eyeliner I'm going to
take the ICO skinny liquid eyeliner
deluxe and in black I always like to
line it up with the end of my brow like
that that comes straight down and then
I'll bring it in on its side and then
I'll work it into the inner corner but I
want it to be the line to be very thin
in here so when it's almost like fade
into nothing when it gets to the inner
corners of the eye and this eyeliner is
supposed to be long lasting fade and
smudge proof now I'm going to go ahead
and put on some mascara the mascara I
have is this tiny little suit better
than sex from Too Faced like that so I'm
going to put that on my lashes I'm
reading something that about the better
than sex right now as I'm putting it on
and it says I didn't know this it's a
collagen fueled formula and that's what
thickens and lengthens and curls your
lashes that's what gives it that extreme
volume I didn't know that now I'm going
to put on some lashes these are pretty
I'm going to put on some of these lashes
I don't know where they're from but
and I will link on below until you later
this stay with you guys and put them on
with y'all because I have been doing it
off-camera a lot and I'm going to go
ahead and put them on with you guys so
I'm taking my eyelash glue my favorite
one is the duo rush on adhesive I need a
new one obviously look at it it's like
stuck together oh it sounds like it's
raining outside I love when it rings
outside I always use this TARDIS eyelash
thingy
I hold it like this and then I put my
lash like that in the middle can you
tell can you see can you see this is a
awkward angle I put it in the middle
tilt my head back and find the center
pop it on to the center
let it sit for like three seconds and
then grab the inside and push it on to
the lash line pushing it down and in and
that is the completed I look I'm going
to go ahead and go down to the face I'm
just going to pop my Lexy brush into the
pure powder and set my makeup in place
for the blush I'm going to take this
city color intense blush palette and
this is the collection - it's like a lot
of warm shades I'm going to take this
one right here and I'm going to pop it
onto the cheek bone I'm just going to
bring it around the temple a little bit
higher up I'm going to take this darker
shade and pop it on to the back of the
apple of the cheek really close to the
hairline I'm kind of layering my blushes
today I'm going to take this peachy red
blush right here and just pop that on
right to the apple of the cheek I this
is the first time that I've done this
technique kind of working different
blushes into my skin so I really like it
I think it looks really pretty like the
dimensional glowy gives you and I'm
going to go ahead and highlight with the
hardest pro glow palette such a nice
palette it has highlights in it a
contour and a cream contour I'm going to
use lit in stunner those are my favorite
ones this is the morphe eat em five to
nine brush I'm going to take stunner pop
that on to the tops of the cheekbones
like that and then I'm going to take lit
and focus up at the top just take
whatever we have left and pop it on to
the nose get that highlight mustache a
little bit right here just because I
have
I dry skin and it looks very dull at
times so I'm just going to put it there
for myself right in here and now my
whole face is lit just need to pop on a
lily for the lipliner I'm gonna take the
LA girl endless semi-permanent Auto lip
liner and this is in the color nectar to
bright orange you shade and I'm going to
line my lips with that this came in the
