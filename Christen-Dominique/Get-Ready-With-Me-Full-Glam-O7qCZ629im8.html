before wreckit-ralph vibes happening
right here hey guys welcome back to my
channel so today I'm gonna be doing it
this spring look right here and you're
gonna be getting ready with me from
start to finish from like the beginning
to the end cuz you know usually
sometimes sometimes I will skip some
parts but no we are doing the whole
thing together me and you you and I can
we talk about how I've been wearing
these nails for like three video
straights because I can't I'm obsessed
with this color I will let you guys
watch that later on in this video to see
what color this mystery color is and I
popped on some blue contacts to change
it up a little bit because you're gonna
notice I have brown eyes but anyways if
you want to get this spring look right
here I feel like my face is oozing
spring like this is spring right here if
you want to see how I got this look then
don't forget to subscribe it to my
channel and you hit that notification
bell so you can be a part of the quad
family I'm totally judging you if you're
not subscribed to my channel and I can
see you without further ado I just put
it on my face let's get hand it to this
video alright so I'm gonna start doing
up my face I have this really weird dry
patchy thing on my cheek and I don't
know don't know what's going on there
but I put some oil on it
this first solid oil I'd been using
gonna put that on and it should pretty
much help it but for some reason I've
been getting really dry and patchy right
in here so I'm gonna let that sit on my
skin for a little bit and dry and while
that's happening I'm gonna do my brows
this is the brow kit that I always use
the benefit foolproof in the number 5
but I like to do is take my brush like
this like I'm holding it this way and
then I just my brows are so hairy right
now like in the places they're not
supposed to be in like way down here to
be honest with you guys
I hardly ever pluck my brows unless I
really really need it which is terrible
cuz I don't get them done I need to like
cover my brow hair
I'll just take concealer and I'm so easy
I'll put it right over it and then the
powder and it makes it look like I have
clean sharp brows that's a lazy girl
brow hack right there I'm gonna
pronounce
a Chanel and the foundation I'm using is
this super tiny sample size of the G way
high coverage foundation and I am using
this one because I honestly feel like
I've been the wrong color this whole
time I was using almond and latte and I
just think those are really really dark
for me right now so they sent this huge
PR package of all the shades and they
have so many shades to choose from I
think I finally found my color it's the
fawn shade and I have this tiny little
bottle to hold me off until I go grab
one myself I have had this no color on
for the past two videos I get so many
questions on what no apologizes and I
haven't remembered to look at the nail
polish yet so nobody notices
do you notice I don't think so let me
try to go through the different chains
of my chokers it's like an obstacle
course here I wanted to try out the new
Mac X Patrick Starr collab that was a
floral realness collection so I have a
few things here that I want to try out
the eye shadow palettes are really cute
so I wanted to use them I'm gonna use
this one first this is stay with me and
I'm gonna take that light purple color
and put it right on my crease area so
I'm gonna take this Laura Mercier
blending brush I need some water I feel
like my my mouth is Coachella right now
one thing new think I've been listening
more to Spanish music for the past like
a few months already I go through these
phases where I really like hip-hop music
and it's like really intense I'll listen
to it every day or I really like pop
music or country I'll get into my
country mode and she's like you can't
get me out of it like I love country so
much recently have been listening to a
lot of Latin music and that is actually
music that I used to listen to as a
little girl that's all I would listen to
and I haven't listened to it a lot and I
just forgot how much I liked it just
something new that I've been doing more
more of I wish she was like eating
better or working out more but that's
definitely not true like what have you
been doing more
let me know in the comments below
because I want to be nosy and I want to
know your life so let me know I've also
been working on my well everything's
already done for my summer collection I
wanna tell you guys everything about it
with Dominik cosmetics but I just I
can't them I will be telling you more
and I'll be showing you more of like the
lemonade palette and eliminate
collection but I have a lot of new
things coming up for you guys with the
lemonade palette and you know a lot of
you want to see that new palette and
want to see the inside I'm excited that
you're excited and it's coming very soon
this summer actually so stay tuned for
that okay I'm gonna go into the next
palette it's called play with me I'm
gonna take this shade right here and
work it into that same area just all on
the outer half of the eye I'm just gonna
work that in there and I'm really just
washing these colors on I'm not really
like trying to be super precise about
anything and this is like the easiest
type of way to do your makeup but just
making sure that everything is blended
not really thinking too hard about it
and then I'm bringing it down on the
lower half of the lash line careful not
to bring it too low I'm gonna take this
deep purple color right here and then
work that I'm gonna take this la girl
204 brush it's a little flat and chunky
and I think it's perfect for like really
blending out these harsh edges right
here you guys have been listening to
card V's new album and that whole entire
album is such a hit like every single
song I like like I like it
and drip-drip fav songs right now cardi
B is just killing it lately I didn't go
to Coachella this year because because I
was like I wanted to chill this year
I do miss not seeing party B like that
would have been amazing and I heard of
her performance was legit so I am so sad
I missed it but I can always watch Alan
like YouTube or something I'm sure this
is a really pretty purple but so is this
one so I'm gonna start off with this one
and see what happens
because this is something that I really
am comfortable with and love using like
these types of colors and I'll just
brighten up my inner corners a little
bit
I'm gonna bring it down all the way to
the inner corner kind of bring it
underneath like that I just I really
like how soft and pretty this combo can
be or really bold and dramatic like this
is 2018 spring and I really like it
I'm just gonna bring this in so it's a
little bit more even with the other side
okay
I'm gonna add a little bit more drama so
I'm gonna take a smaller more in densely
packed brush honest this is actually my
favorite makeup brush to use it's the
Vasanti brush the contour eye shadow for
brush I'm gonna take more in that stay
with me palette more of this purple
right here well I'm bringing my
eyeshadow really far out today really
been like my mistress of colors shady
cream matte eyeliner thing to line my
eye and it's really creamy it's just so
much easier to do a wing with gel I feel
like there's less mess you know be as
precise and you can clean it up super
easy because it's cream so you can work
it around I'm gonna add some mascara to
my lashes really quick I swear you guys
this is the best mascara for your lower
lashes the best from thrice cosmetics
it's the liquid lash extensions
it's literally like liquid lash
extensions just like the bottle alright
I'm gonna take the Lily lashes Sephora
collection lashes in Mykonos okay so I
want I'm feeling something more pink on
the lash line so I'm gonna take the bomb
batter up batter up and just like this
pearly pinky shade I'm just gonna pop it
on it feel like it'll really make the
look really really pretty and it does it
just adds some type it just looks like
diamonds in your eye diamonds in your
eye balls
well I love the way that look okay so
I'm gonna cover these under-eye circles
I'm going to use the Tarte shape tape
I'm gonna use this in such a long time
the light medium shade and
run it through like sir I'm actually I'm
gonna go back into the eyes really quick
I'm gonna take this little tiny brush
here I'm gonna take this really pretty
like almost electric purple and I'm
gonna put it right on the lower lash
line I'm gonna take my setting powder
I'm gonna try the dermablend setting
powder today it's the translucent one
I'm used to using like the Laura Mercier
the k'kaw more recently but I want to
try this guy out give it a try so I'm
going to take my wet Beauty Blender it's
still pretty moist whoa that is white
let's see how the flashback works on
this thing okay so while I'm baking I'm
gonna contour contour my face bones just
chisel these little guys out into a
smaller version of themselves shrink the
nose down just a little bit on the side
I don't need to go all the way down my
nose I just need to get pinched in these
two little sides and just add a little
bit more definition here over and I am
actually thinking of doing a contouring
do's and don'ts if you guys want to see
that let me know in the comments and
then once um dem contouring I just hit
it with a Beauty Blender if there's what
wow this is a really good one it's not
bad I really like the way it softens out
your skin and it brightens too so know
that we've contoured we baked I'm gonna
add some bronzer I'm gonna take the
chocolate soleil bronzer here from Too
Faced I also want to do where you guys
pick my makeup but I'm trying to figure
out if I should do that like in our
community chat you have to be subscribed
to me if you want to choose an all my
makeup so I'm gonna have you guys to
choose it I'm planning on doing that
soon but I'm trying to figure out for
when you do it community chat we're on
Twitter or something like that I'm gonna
figure that out you guys let me know - I
think it would be fun in the community
chat like that we have on YouTube
already cuz we're already here alright
so now I have the blush palette I'm not
blushing powder blush duo this is part
of the floral realness collab and I'm
gonna take both of these guys I know
it's like you can use one to contour and
one for blush but I'm gonna use both of
that they're gonna be really pretty
together
I'm just gonna pop it on my cheeks like
this and took a really pretty soft peach
color for the
later I thought this would be perfect
for this this is the Lata X Smashbox
collab highlight can we just take a
moment to appreciate the beautiful
packaging of this highlighter it is look
at it it is so beautiful it's like a
rose gold rose you open it up it's like
the lightest highlight that I got and
work it all over my face so my
cheekbones I like that it's soft it's
not like too intense I'm gonna take some
of this fix+ from Mac it's the prep and
prime this is the gold light fix plus
and it's just really pretty gold shimmer
I get that it's very soft so I'm gonna
set everything with this we're gonna be
so glowy today we're gonna be going with
sweet mama star edge-to-edge lip liner
for Mac to line my lips ooh I like this
combo and then for the gloss I'm going
to take mom a star kiss so pretty so I'm
going to lay that right on top
