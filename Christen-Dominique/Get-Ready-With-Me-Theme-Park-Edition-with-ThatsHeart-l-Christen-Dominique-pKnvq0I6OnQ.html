everyone today I'm doing a special get
ready with me slash theme park the
essentials featuring this super cute and
beautiful that's heart don't forget to
stay until the end to see what our
beauty essentials are and most
importantly our bloopers and enjoy the
video here I am hanging out with my
Jayden bear watching Disney online and
then I head over to my coffee maker and
make some coffee and a little secret for
you guys I like to have a little coffee
with my creamer because I have the
biggest sweetest this is the biggest
wheatus to this I'm biggest sweet tooth
ever then I grabbed some cherries
because everybody eats cherries and
coffee the morning right
starting off with my moisturizing SPF
cream from pure leaves to hydrate and
protect my face from the Sun
you
I don't want too much heavy foundation
so I'm opting for a BB cream
I'm taking my Holy Grail face primer /
BB cream this is from bareMinerals
primetime and this just makes everything
look smooth and gives it a really nice
coverage my under eyes need a bit more
coverage so I'm taking the honest dasya
concealer in 1.5 and lightly patting
that onto my under eyes to set
everything in place I'm using my current
favourite powder from Anna kadar in the
color c3 for today's brows I'm just
taking a pencil and I'm going to use the
spoolie end to brush them out and then
fill in the sparse areas and then brush
them out again now I'm taking my lavish
palette and picking up the color Sienna
to add subtle depth to the crease using
windshield wiper motions now I'm picking
up the color stubborn from the BOMs nude
tude palette it's a pretty light peachy
pink color and I'm just going to pack
that onto the lid
for the highlight and picking up the
color cream and applying it to my brow
bone
or my liner I'm using the Kat Von D
tattoo liner and I actually just bought
this and it was my first time using it I
really like it it is really creamy but
you may have to rekey pre applying it to
get to get it to be really dark and
opaque but it does have a creamy
consistency to it
No
for my lashes I'm using the Vincent
Longo mascara and I really have been
loving this mascara because it has a dry
formula and it holds your curl longer
and I feel like it gives you more
fullness in your lashes so it's
currently my favorite mascara for my
cheeks I'm using the light pink blush
from be a bombshell in the color sweet
cheeks and I went for more blush
coverage today because I feel like it
makes you look more youthful and
youthful is good right for the lips
I went for a lightweight moisturizing
balm so today I'm using the pixie butter
balm in the color ripe raspberry and it
just gives you a nice wash of color to
your lips next I'm using my favorite lip
balm from Noah and this has a spearmint
flavor so I like it it makes me feel
like I just ate spearmint gum even
though I didn't their secret now I'm
curling my lashes to give them a flirty
curl and since we're going to be under
the Sun all day I'm using my Urban Decay
all nighter setting spray to make sure
my makeup stays in place
and now it's time to pick my outfit if
you want to see heart and my outfit
details check out her channel for our
Coty DS before I head out and packing
what I'm going to carry to the theme
park I don't like to carry too much so I
just grabbed my neutral crossbody
stuffed my makeup bag and there my
lotion wipes because I'm super dry my ID
and my season pass and then of course my
sunnies to protect my eyes and in case
my phone dies because of taking too many
selfies
I took my Giro portable charger and
that's it
today I'm here in heart and Disneyland
and you want to show you guys some of
our theme parks essential so here we go
one of the things I always bring with me
no matter where I go is a lip balm today
a housecoat pixel on because it has like
a little bit of color to it and then I
use my boy half lip balm it's so
moisturizing I love it so I just use
them together alright so for my lip ease
I brought three items so these are the
ones I'm wearing on my lips today I'm
wearing the your extreme in three five
six and the lip gloss is in zero zero
two and then I have this baby lips right
here from Maybelline which is amazing
it's perfect especially when you're out
and about under the Sun then another
thing that I said okay is my powder
right now is my favorite powder is from
super flowers
my compact I brought the cargo blu-ray
high-definition makeup setting
pressed powder such a mouthful and it
does a really great job mattifying my
face especially when it's really hot oh
I wanted to try that one but they don't
let it that um Queen me which is like
the CBS forever New York all the way to
New York gonna do it unless you have to
go take a moisturizer with me it has SPF
of 30 sunscreen
just from Kirby's and
how do you pronounce it purely here
these I thought it was perfect for now
gonna get right let us know in the
comments if this Mel's so good
very soft my my lotion I brought in a
bath and Bodyworks a beautiful day go
sandwich smells amazing you have to
smell this because it smells so perfect
man what I really like about our bath
and Bodyworks emotions they're very
long-lasting evening last throughout the
day and evening ion is your no good
super shock now like you just showered
like that smelling like shampoo the next
thing that I brought with me was the
honest on your brow is because it does
get kind of setting out here I think my
eyebrows so I brought this - I actually
love her eyebrow so much that I bought
the same thing in my yeah so these are
pretty random but I brought scrunchies
just because it gets over it gets me
honestly I think but anime Kristen's
gonna wear one of these yeah Jing like
this I might not because they're
convenient and you never know sometimes
there's days when why did it get so
let's see okay so this is not beauty or
fashion related but I have a movie
inside my bag and just because you need
especially if you love taking selfies
like me and Kristen you have to have a
low fee to charge your boat at all times
because I need you need your phone when
you're at theme parks
yeah I write lady here the bus Kristen
comes over to buy this I was supposed to
buy a car charger so this is like you
should just be like sunglasses are such
an eventual
mark has
