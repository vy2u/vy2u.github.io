low swiss be romantic doesn't matter
typical morning I can't find my phone
and then when I do find it it's in the
most obvious place ever I like to check
snapchat in the mornings I've been doing
daily vlogging until Christmas or
vlogmas thanks Ingrid for that it's been
pretty fun if you want to watch me on
the daily just check out my second
channel Cristen vlogs you'll see a new
video every day and I am gonna go ahead
and brush my teeth because I obviously
got dissed this morning so you know my
face has been breaking out a lot so I've
been using this creamy based cleanser
from Frank body and I like it because it
came out great and then I looked at the
back of the bottle and it said I was
looking at it like what the heck and
then it said I look dirty so you can
look clean so like answered my question
in my head this is really cute they
always had like the cutest little
descriptions and then I'm using in
everyday moisturizer on my face it's
very lightweight but on my under eyes
because it's such a sensitive area that
age is pretty quick I like to use a
thicker moisturizer there every day and
every night and I use the tarte maracuja
moisturizer because it's amazing i put
it on the highlighted points of my face
my face and then i change into some
comfy clothes and hubby made me
breakfast and he's finally giving me a
kiss yay um and I make my own coffee in
the morning just because I like it super
sweet and this is basically my outfit
for the day I like to keep it pretty -
these adorable booties cat ring and
white tee are from joyas i'll link
everything below but this is the makeup
look we're doing today so if you want to
learn how to get it let's just keep
watching so I'm going to use this primer
right here I used it yesterday for the
first time it's pretty interesting
because it's like a creamy primer and
I'm just going to put that on before I
start my makeup and it kind of made
everything really smooth out and matte
which I really like so if your oily this
works awesome for your skin this works
really good to fill in your pores to
kind of like the Porefessional
and it feels really velvety and smooth
and then before I start my full face
makeup I always put on a bomb I just got
this one in a few days ago this is
cha-cha bomb from benefit it smells good
and just hydrate your lips a little bit
because they're really chapped
especially because of the winter so
hydrating my face in my lips is really
important to me and then next I'm going
to do my foundation for foundation I'm
gonna go full coverage today I'm using
the Tarte Amazonian clay full coverage
foundation and which shade in my in
uneven over ancient medium tan honey so
I have been using the Amazonian clay
foundation a whole lot if you guys
follow me on snapchat you already know
that but I like that it feels like a
primer so it's a very velvety and smooth
it kind of smooth out your skin texture
and fills in those pores so that's why
I've been using it a lot I love the
coverage on it and for the concealer I'm
using the Mac Pro Longwear I'm an NC 25
in case you guys are wondering and I'm
just bouncing it into my skin so that it
gives you the best coverage so you want
to bounce it bounce it bounce it hashtag
bounce it I'm going to be taking this
Gwen Stefani palette by urban decay for
the eye I'm using those two Toby shades
for the crease area I'm just going to
wash that into the crease and then if
you have a little bit trouble with
blending just use your finger I swear
it's like the next best thing to the
beauty blender I also am going to use
this darker shade on the lower part of
my lash line and then blend it out with
a big fluffy brush I'm using a denser
brush to Pat it on and then I'm using a
big fluffy brush that will be used for
the crease so that it blends everything
together and it still has some of the
other shade on it so it blends really
nicely so I'm going to take the same
darkest shadow and apply it to the outer
crease I'm using a pretty dense brush
and I put a lot of shadow on that brush
so I decided I'm gonna use a clean brush
to blend it out so that's what I'm doing
it's similar to the 239 for a Mac and
I'm going to go ahead and do the same
thing to the other eye and then I'm
going back and forth between these two
brushes because I want the intensity to
be just right I don't want to put too
much but I I want to gradually intensify
it so that's why I keep going back and
forth there and then once I have it the
way I want I go ahead and blend out the
edges so it's nice
hazy and soft looking and now I am going
to use a little bit of a cool purple
tone this is from a g-way palette and I
will have it linked below it's a very
beautiful palette I wanted a little bit
of a purple cool tone purple in the
crease so I went ahead and blended that
right on top of the dark brown I also
did the same thing to the lower lash
line
I feel like this makes the look a little
bit more wintery and cool but at the
same time we're going to have that warm
winter bye bye this beautiful color from
colour-pop it's called on the rocks and
it is literally the most beautiful Brown
bronzy thing I've ever seen in my life
put that on of course with my ring
finger because I feel like these color
pop shadows blend better with your
finger and then I'm applying a little
bit of a winged liner this is the makeup
forever ink liner it dries matte it is
my all-time favorite besides Kat Von D
trooper and now for my mascara I'm using
this new mascara I got in from benefit
it has crystals Swarvoski I don't know
how to say that name Swarovski crystals
on it and I thought it was really cute
so I decided to use that today for the
waterline I'm using this beautiful
purple pastel shade it's called crybaby
from colour-pop and now I am going back
in with the deepest purple from the
jouer palette to deepen up that crease
I'm using my friend Alex factions lashes
they're so perfect and pretty I am using
these right here I pop them on really
quick and then I'm going to go back into
my skin and brighten everything up so
I'm using the Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer to brighten up my under eyes
and also add a base for the highlight
I'm blending everything out with my warm
ring finger because I feel like using
your skin to blend things that oh that
sounds weird using your finger to blend
things out just makes it melt into your
skin and look very natural I am using
this contour stick from Tarte it is
something that I've never tried before
but I really like it it's very easy to
use you can be very precise with it I
don't usually use creme contours but I
definitely will start using this little
guy
and I'm also going to do a little bit of
baking so I took my laura mercier
setting powder and i just put a little
bit underneath my eyes you know the
highlighted areas let it sit there for a
little bit and then wipe it off yes I
posed with the palette before taking off
the powder using the tartines contour
palette it is an awesome palette and
using the darkest shade and going over
the hollow areas that I've already kind
of touched on just to make sure that
they're extra defined and def course
extra flicky I also have really been
into very structured draw lines lately I
don't know why some people might think
it's a little masculine but I have been
into contouring crazy around my jawline
because I want it to be super structured
I'm going to take this banana shade
right here to brighten up my under eyes
and I'm also going to focus this right
next to the side of the nose to make the
nose look a little bit more narrow and
lifted and for the blush I'm using the
blush inside the palate it's very pretty
and it matches perfectly with everything
for the lips I'm using the Too Faced
chocolate melted lipstick or melted
chocolate liquid lipstick it's this is
in the shade chocolate honey it is so
perfect consistency of the the color is
amazing it's very buttery and it looks
beautiful here is the final look guys I
hope you enjoyed the tutorial now I am
ready to head out I'm using my cat ring
right here it's my favorite ring right
now it's from joyous and then the cat
ring is right next my cat ring next to
my desktop so I just put that on really
quick and then I grab some booties
usually in the winter and I like to move
oh I like to walk comfortably so I
choose some booties that are very
comfortable but still look a little
festive so I'm just going to put on some
gold um booties and I have these jeans
on right here that are kind of
distressed at the knee and at the bottom
ankle which is really cute and I just
have a plain white tee and throw on a
scarf I also threw on this jacket I got
it as a present from Lulu's on hitting 1
million subscribers so it's like super
special to me and I think it's really
cute jacket too so this is my outfit for
the day
and this is pretty much the entire look
I love you guys so much I hope you
enjoyed this video as much as I enjoyed
making it for you and until the next
video bye dolly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
