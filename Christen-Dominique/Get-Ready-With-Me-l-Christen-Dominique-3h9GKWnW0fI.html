called you what we're going to make it
the one on your Instagram pics well then
give me a second and I'll make it I hope
you guys enjoyed that little skit that
me and Laura just did for dorks what can
I say Smashbox has came out with 120
lipstick and I have chosen this
beautiful shade right here they've also
created a 3d printer it's crazy it's a
printer that prints lipsticks it's
really the first of its kind sounds
crazy but it's it's real I'm going to
show you guys how it works right now so
I printed out my lipstick I just used a
piece of paper I kissed it and then it
printed out my lip print cuz in the
shade fireball I also wrote my name it
on yes my handwriting is very beautiful
thank you mm-hmm so I'm gonna be giving
these away there's gonna be 50 winners
the link is gonna be below if you want
to enter to win one of these these are
actual lipsticks like this print right
here is gonna last you about two weeks
you can just get like your lip brush or
your finger and apply it to your lips
if you guys want my lip print I'm very
excited for this 3d printer and I think
it's really cool if you want to learn
how to get this look then keep watching
all right so we're gonna jump right into
the foundation I'm going to use this
Estee Lauder I've never seen anything
like this it's a foundation pump it like
this is the pump right here so I just
bit like that you see I've never tried
this one before this is the double wear
let's see how this is all right I like
the original one in the bottle because
the coverage is so good and I think I'm
going to apply it with that with a
Beauty Blender this is kind of cool
because it doesn't give you too much and
you just pump it out like this just
baiting the foundation into my face
beating sounds so like so aggressive
this is pretty good I like this I don't
feel like it's heavy at all
I don't know if it's the same as the
original one in the bottle because it
just feels a little too lightweight but
I definitely see the coverage for the
concealer I'm going to I just got some
of these Mac Pro Longwear that was out
to get those under right this is a very
full coverage concealer it's within my
favorite concealers because I have a few
this is definitely one of those hide
anything on your face kind of concealer
so what I'll do is put concealer over my
eyes if I don't want to add like an
extra layer of something on my face I'll
put concealer on and this is just going
to help the color stand out so one my
foundation and my concealer dry on my
face I'm going to let that sit and I'm
gonna do my brows while I do that and
I'm gonna do that off crema I'll be back
with the brows oh I don't know if you
guys know this but pastels are my
favorite colors this eyeshadow palette
is full of pastel shades oh sorry
and love so I'm gonna go ahead and start
off with berries and cream it's like a
bone color with a pinky undertone so I'm
gonna go ahead and take that on a flat
shader brush and I'm going to work that
all over my lid this is going to help
your eyeshadow stay on longer and it's
also going to help with the blending
when you have a nice even smooth surface
to work with the eyeshadow just blends
like butter it's so much easier now we
move on to the transition shade I'm
gonna take cone which is this one right
here and I'm gonna apply it right onto
the eye socket in windshield wiper
motions so we're just going to go back
and forth like this also keep your hand
towards the back so you have less
control and it just slides on very
smooth
and light you always want to start off
lighter and then gradually build up the
pigments so I'm going to go ahead and
lightly sweep this back and forth onto
the socket for the next crease color I'm
going to take blueberry swirl this is a
matte plummy shade and I'm going to work
this into the crease as well but
focusing a little bit further on the
outer part of the lid and I'm actually
going to take it past where the bone is
I'm going to take it right past there
just to elongate the eye shape a little
bit I feel like these shadows are very
buildable you can go a little bit
lighter or you can build it up next I'm
going to take what is this next I'm
going to take sherbert right here and
I'm going to pop it on to the inner part
of the lid I'm gonna take this Luxy to
1/3 a shading brush and I'm going to pop
sherbert right in to that open space and
then for the bottom lash line I'm going
to go ahead and take blueberry swirl and
then I'm gonna layer lavender honey
right underneath it I feel like I'm
barely touching it I'm just feathering
it across the lower lash line connecting
the eyeshadow on top if it gets a little
bit too low like this we can just clean
it up with a concealer brush later so
don't worry about that or you can just
go with your finger and just clean it up
nothing fancy next I'm going to take
this really beautiful lavender honey
shade and I'm gonna work that onto the
outer part of the lash line just work it
right on top so make sure you're not
covering that plum shade I'm also going
to come right on top of the brow bone
with berries and cream and just pop it
right underneath I like highlighting the
brow bone with a matte shade because I
feel like it brings out the shape of
your brow and it also enhances the
eyeshadow I always leave one side of the
eyeshadow brush clean so that I can
bring it drag it down to the other
shades without putting more eye shadow
on top and blending the two shades
together I'm gonna create a wing now
because in my last video I didn't do a
wing and I was like a Vegas seizure
finally I'm gonna go ahead and create a
wing using a
liner that I have it used before this is
these you a kitten liner and it has a
felt tip on it we're going to try it out
today and see how our wings look with
this liner I'm going to show you guys
this trick because it is very helpful if
you want your eyeliner to really cut
someone if you really want your eyeliner
to be very sharp at the end and just
soleil the day I would take a concealer
brush this one is a flat definer brush
this is from Sigma it's the e 15 and you
want to use a concealer that's kind of
thick just clean up the bottom part of
the liner how you like it and then once
you have it like that I take off the
excess concealer to where it's pretty
dry like this and then I start to work
it downwards so if you want to make sure
your eyeliner is clean and sharp this
trick steady we're gonna pop on some
mascara and then apply some lashes right
after for the lashes I'm going to use
feather ret from house of lashes they're
these right here so make sure that our
face doesn't slip or slide away I'm
going to go ahead and put on it is
pixilated color finishing powder from
japanesse and I'm gonna take my big ol
fluffy brush just gonna swirl it around
up and down Pat it onto my face I'm
going to take the lorac pro contour
palette and I'm going to go into your
the light contour and I'm going to
contour my nose and the halls of my
cheekbones you never want to go past the
cheekbone because then it just starts to
look a little dirty and blending up and
then with a fluffier brush I'm blending
that out
and then with the beige highlight just
gonna go down the top of the nose I'm
going to do some bronzer and I'm going
to use the rodeo instaglam compact
deluxe bronzing powder this is a long
name I'm going to use this to give our
face a little bit of color so I'm just
going to take it around the temples down
to the cheekbone you might want to put
glasses on for this this is the new
highlight from as you way I'm going to
use the color rose quartz and it's this
pinky champagne color it's so beautiful
I'm going to go ahead and take some of
that on my Sigma strobing fan brush and
pop it on to the tops of the cheekbones
nose Cupid's bow the most exciting part
for me today is the lips because
smashbox has launched 120 lipsticks
insane all 120 lipsticks are on smashbox
comm I'm using do no wrong in matte and
I'm just going to apply it to my lips
