hey guys welcome back I am now going to
get ready for my long day of relaxation
on this cruise boat so we are getting
ready together I'm using my Smashbox
primer to smooth out my skin and now I'm
going in with my bare minerals
complexion rescue tinted hydrating gel
cream and it has a really interesting
texture kind of feels like it would be a
primer but it's not it actually covers
really well without feeling really heavy
or cakey so I'm just going to even out
my skin tone with this this is in the
color spice im using my dual ended it
cosmetics fluffy brush for this it's a
foundation brush and on the other side
is a concealer brush for my concealer
I'm using my good old trusty NARS this
is in creamy custard I'm just gonna
focus this on the inner corners of my
eyes where there's the darkest and then
I'm also going to do a little highlight
little triangle in between my brows and
blend it out with my finger as you can
see I put it on the bridge of my nose
and Cupid's bow so here I'm just
blending out my concealer and now I am
going to do this face for you guys and
now I'm going into the Urban Decay Naked
3 palette and I have nooner it's a matte
topee color and I'm going to focus that
on the outer part of the eye and then
softly bring it into the inner third
place I'm also going to apply this color
to the lower part of the lash line and
this is going to add balance and give
our eyes and depth right there now I'm
going in with buzz which is this really
pretty pink champagne color I'm going to
apply this on the inner third we're
wondering rip brush I'm using it's a
concealer brush tax a lot it's really
dense oh it packs a lot of pigment onto
your eye I'm also going to apply buzz to
the inner part of the lower lash line
and going out towards the end
now I'm taking moonlight which is this
beautiful color from ziwei and it is a
mousse II creamy lip feeling kind of eye
shadow I'm going to apply it to the
inner corners it's very glittery kind of
looks like I have diamond drops of Tears
that's how I like to explain it and now
I'm going to take my tart liner this is
a dark brown
I'm going to add a wing to my eye
next I'm going to apply my mascara this
is the tarte mascara and I'm going to
skip on lashes today just because I'm
gonna be lounging around on the boat but
to give me that flirty look I'm going to
curl my lashes which I hardly ever do
I'm definitely going to do it today
because I want to look a little bit
flirty it is my anniversary today so you
know just set my makeup I'm going to use
the cargo HD powder and I'm in the
number 32 apply it I'm using the bare
minerals full face brush to set my under
eyes and brighten them a bit I'm using
the manic kadar powder in c3 now I'm
going to add some bronzers to my
cheekbones I'm using the Too Faced
bronzed import list I did for some
reason break out really bad on this trip
just I don't want any type of shimmer on
my face that's gonna highlight the acne
in the bumps so I'm using this poreless
because it's very matte and it fills in
all those fine lines and pores I'm gonna
add a touch of highlight I'm using new
gerard cosmetics in maryland's he's a
beautiful golden illuminating
highlighter I'm just gonna add a little
bit to my temple where I have a very
smooth even skin surface and then a
little bit on my nose my lips are kind
of cracked right now so I'm going to add
the jewel a lip balm to soften them up
and get them ready for lipstick now I'm
going to take the Too Faced naked dolly
lipstick I'm also going to add the
Milani pink love just to create like a
nudey pink color
