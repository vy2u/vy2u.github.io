local skin care

argan oil and glam oh I love glam glow
I'm gonna try the Vasanti exfoliating
what is this brighten up exfoliating
cleanser try this dial definitely needed
some type of exfoliation sweet skin is
so dull
okay bull butter just gonna use some
glam low-flush brightening treatment
this should really brighten me up and
just wake up my skin I love the way this
stuff smells I'm just going to leave it
on there for a little bit and I should
be wake up for my coffee my eyes are
really bright today yep I'm weird we
grabbed the solution my hands are always
too dry after washing my face not soap
radio revitalizing lotion in the Phoenix
smells good
feels really silky time for coffee
and see what's up on snapchat
check out my messages for my my besties
my besties oh that looks good happy
birthday okay oh what a cutie how cute
it's coffee time which is best time of
the day
I sing so bad
give my little mug and my Starbucks
still really good I gotta fill those ice
trays up I love this creamer I have to
definitely snapchat this so that my
snapchat mam can go pick it up alright I
got my coffee I'm up I'm ready yes I'm
gonna drink it and I'm out of my
thoughts and I'm in to this tutorial I'm
walking through my living room this is
my living room slash office Beauty room
so I'm gonna sit my coffee down probably
snapchat a little bit and then i'ma
start filming this video for you guys on
this look so if you want to check it out
then you keep watching
we are going to moisturize our face
before we start a makeup so I'm going to
apply the nabe oxygenating cream anytime
you apply a moisturizer before your
foundation your foundation is always
going to go on a lot smoother so now
that I have my moisturizer on I'm going
to go ahead and even out my skin tone
I'm applying the Make Up For Ever HD
foundation and I'm using this new sponge
I got it's called the contour sponge I
love it especially for baking or setting
your powder it's good for foundation and
powder so this is a newbie of mine I'm
in love works just as good as the Beauty
Blender and I think it's like ten
dollars cheaper and then I'm just going
in with the Kat Von D concealer to cover
up my under-eye circles and I'm using
the anastacio pomade dip brow in ash
brown just to draw on my eyebrow because
obviously it's completely missing
definitely m.i.a lately taking a while
for me to grow it back ever since I cut
off the end it's been a while so here I
have the soft ochre Paint Pot from Mac
I'm just going to lay this all over my
lid so that I have a nice even
application for my eye shadow
when I saw this I got really excited
it's new mix cosmetics it's the
eyeshadow trio and I think they made
these specifically for the glam bag it's
such a cute little palette I'm taking
the first color right here and I'm going
to place this all over the lid and the
inner corners and then I'm going to take
this bronzy shade and focus this into
the crease
I'm going to take it inwards towards the
outer part of the lid and kind of create
an open wing so right here I'm just
intensifying it and bringing it inwards
towards the eye and this is going to
just emphasize the crease so now I'm
going to pick up this matte black shade
right here and I'm going to create a
wing with it I haven't done a wing with
an eye shadow in very long time but I
really like the way this came out I
think because the shadow itself is very
smooth and it glides on really nicely so
I had a lot of control over how I wanted
my wing to go and I feel like this is
kind of a foolproof way of creating the
perfect wing because it's shadow and
especially if you haven't put any powder
on your face yet you can just use a
concealer brush to clean it up like I
did right here you have perfect wings
like I'm so happy with the way my wings
came out on this shadow look and then
I'm going to also place the black right
on the lash line the bottom lash line
I'm taking it a little bit more than
halfway in and then I'm going in with
that bronzy shade we used earlier and
I'm going right underneath the black
going right above it on the top wing
just so that it could peek through and
it looks Smokey and hazy
here I just grabbed a little bit more of
that lighter color in the palette and I
placed it right on the inner corners
just to make the inner corners pop more
and add some more light to that area and
then I'm taking an urban decay pencil
and I am lining the inner waterline and
also right on top of the black that we
used earlier just to soften it up a bit
since we're done with the eye shadow I'm
going to go ahead and take my Urban
Decay Naked concealer just to brighten
up my under-eye circles a little bit
more and the highlighted points of my
face I'm just gonna blend that in with
my finger because sometimes your finger
is better than anything else your
natural body heat warms up the makeup so
it looks a lot more natural and blends
easy next I'm using the city color be
bold mascara this is the three times
volume and length three times extra
volume I definitely believe this if you
guys can't tell look at my lashes you
see that next I'm just gonna apply some
falsies on my go off camera come back
Here I am with the false lashes yeah
contour time I'm using the Charlotte
Tilbury film-star bronze &amp;amp; Glow to
contour my face and I'm just going
around the perimeters also down the
sides of my nose to straighten it out a
bit and I'm using a smaller version of
the same style of brush I use on my face
so I'll have it linked below in case you
guys are wondering for the blush today
we're doing something a little bit
different i'm using the evelyn Iona
cream blush in ash this formula melts
into your skin it's super blendable and
it gives you a really nice natural flush
of color which works great with our eye
look now I'm going to do a little bit of
baking I'm going to take my Laura
Mercier loose translucent powder and my
contour sponge just to set the powder
thickly on the area where we would
highlight right underneath the contour
and anywhere else you want to brighten
up you're gonna leave it there for about
five minutes
dust it away and then you are going to
look flawless in your Instagram pictures
but now I'm just gonna add a little bit
more of a highlight underneath my eyes
I'm going off my Kat Von D this is the
banana powder and I'm just gonna
brighten them up a little bit more
next I'm going to go in with my Makeup
Forever aqua waterproof lip liner this
is in the shade medium natural beige I'm
going to line my lips just a little bit
for the fullness and then I'm gonna go
in with the Kat Von D lipstick and Noble
and guys just letting you know right now
I have a new favorite nudey pink
lipstick it's this one right here it's
matte it's beautiful and opaque you guys
it's amazing so that your highlight is
on fleek I'm going to use color pops
parasol and I use that on the tops of my
cheekbones the tip of my nose and right
on the Cupid's bow and then I'm just
gonna seal it in and make it extra flaky
by putting that highlight by Charlotte
Tilbury I'm gonna take my flyaways by
using the Octavio Molina hair a safety
the argon oil this is going to help with
all my frizziness and it also has
vitamin E in a ton of antioxidants if we
get dressed I am gonna wear this cute
outfit from hot Miami styles it's a crop
top with sleeves cuz it gets chilly at
night still and these really cute ripped
jeans I'm gonna pair it with these nude
lasik heels and then I'm just gonna head
over to my full-length mirror just to
make sure the outfit is right and then
pick a purse I usually pick this Louie
Vuitton one for anything that I wear
that's beige or white or has any bite
kind of denim in it because it just
matches so perfectly and that's it this
is my outfit for the day my makeup I
hope you enjoyed this video it was so
different from any other type of video
I've ever done so I really hope you
enjoyed it and that's it I love you guys
so much I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
