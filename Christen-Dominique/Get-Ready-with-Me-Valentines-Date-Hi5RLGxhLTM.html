looking oh not so hot just like in Ave
to touch it so fine it's all mine hey
baby
oh the watch it so sweet I guess he is
kind of a romantic so today you'll be
getting ready with me for my Valentine's
date with heavy let's go what to wear
uh no not going clubbing tonight too
cutesy everybody wears red
I want something Lacy and pink no too
formal ooh I like it
before I start on my makeup I'm gonna
take my first aid beauty skin at rescue
deep cleanser why does that feel like
that was a mouthful and it's a foaming
gel and in unclogs pores and minimizes
them as well all right my face is washed
so now I'm gonna moisturize my body I'm
gonna take my Pacifica Hawaiian Ruby
guava body butter smells amazing now
that my hands are moisturize I'm gonna
go ahead and pay my nails with my Zoe
nail polish in the color dot I love this
color for the winter in the spring
starting straight with the eyes and
taking my Urban Decay primer potion and
just evenly applying that all over the
lid now that our eyes are primed I'm
taking the Maybelline Color tattoo metal
and the color inked in pink this is
going to be a base to our lids using the
color coax from the device to palette
this is a medium metallic pink with
golden sparkles just apply this over the
base now I'm gonna take the color rewind
which is a taupe color so you can use
any other taupe color and add it to the
outer V area and then you're going to
sweep it inwards doing it this way will
create a nice gradient going inwards
towards your eye now just take a fluffy
brush and blend out the edges taking the
color x-rated which is a baby pink satin
shadow I'm going to sweep it across the
top of the crease and then blend out
with a fluffy brush
to smoke out this light peace shadow I'm
taking the color lovesick and focusing
on the color on the crease sweeping
outwards toward the brow bone for a
smoky effect to highlight the brow bone
I'm using a matte bone color and patting
the color onto the brow bone
slightly driving it down into the top of
the crease for this look I'm going to
keep it simple with the liner just
lining the top lashline making sure that
the line starts then and gets thicker
moving outwards next I'm gonna take the
Mallee Beauty ever colors starlight
waterproof eyeliner in the shade star
shine and just apply it to the inner
corners going back on top with the color
pearl now I'm just gonna add the laura
mercier shadow stick and the color plum
to the lower waterline to create a
slight haze on the lower lash line and
taking the tinny beauty cream shadow and
the color ambrosia I'm about to apply my
mascara so I'm going to curl my lashes
and I've been using the lorac Pro pretty
often you guys know that I have really
been loving this mascara lately to add a
little bit of flirtiness to our eyes I'm
taking J cap Beauty eyelashes and 747x s
I'm just going to define my face a
little with my bronzer from my lorac Pro
to go palette now for the blush I'm
using the city color be matte blush in
the color of fresh melon and it's really
such a pretty natural hint of color for
your cheeks I'm loving this blush next
I'm using the NYX lip primer to fill in
any lines and then using the Sigma lose
the halo lip concealer which works great
to cancel out any natural pigmentation
on your lips and is a nice nude base to
add a nice girly pink lip I'm taking the
pot Beauty plump pout mini lip gloss in
the color Fiji freesia which is much
brighter but I
want it to be too bright so I use that
nude lip concealer to help lighten it up
a bit and this is the final look a light
pink smokey eye and a light pink lip
such a light feminine look for
Valentine's Day I hope you find the
beauty in something or someone new today
and until the next video bye dollies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
