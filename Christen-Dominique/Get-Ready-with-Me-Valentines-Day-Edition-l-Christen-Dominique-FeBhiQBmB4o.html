standing right before me you open my
hand and put your heart right in it cuz
you are my
can you take me out to see your favorite
band and now hope I can make you smile
and I was feeling just beginning but
this is gonna last it's gonna last too
last cuz you are mine
hi everyone my name is Susie haha uh my
name is Susan actually sounds pretty
real I obviously have some issues with
my throat today so I sound a little bit
like Gavin Sheeran so um yeah don't
don't mind my voice um but anyways today
I am doing a get ready with me for
Valentine's Day my date with my hubby
actually going out tonight and I don't
know what I'm gonna wear for Valentine's
Day yet so you guys can help me out with
that I showed you a few different
options at the beginning of this video
so just let me know which outfit I
should choose in the comments below and
if you want to learn how I got this look
then here you have foundation on and now
I'm going to jump into the concealer I'm
using the Naked skin concealer from
urban decay and this is in light neutral
when I put on concealer I like to keep
it right below the under a circle like
right in this area and then I blend it
upwards and inwards with my finger
oh I'm going to jump into the eyeshadow
I'm going to use the bareMinerals 5 + 1
BB advanced cream eyeshadow so this also
acts like a primer and this is in candle
lit peach
hey lid I'm using the zoeva naturally
yours palate and I'm going to use this
color here it's called core and it's one
of my favorite lid colors because it's
not stark white it has a little bit of
beige and yellow undertones to it so it
looks really natural I'm gonna apply
this all over my lid up towards the brow
bone it just makes everything look
smoother and even for the crease I'm
going to be using actually for the
entire eye shadow look I'm gonna be
using the Jacqueline Hill favorites
palette from morphe brushes and it's
kind of got something or prints on it
but it's okay I'm going to be using this
color here for my crease and 224 zoeva
blending brush
so I'm gonna take this color right here
and I'm gonna place it right on the
outer part of the crease and then fade
it inwards
so that everything looks soft I'm gonna
take my blending brush that I started
out way it's okay if it has some of the
color on it it'll be easy to blend so
I'm just taking that and blending it
upwards towards the brow bone to give
the look more dimension I'm taking this
matte hot pink color and I'm placing it
on the outer part of the crease and then
just focusing on the outer part blending
it outwards next I'm taking this dark
purple color and I'm placing it right on
the upper part of the crease blending it
upwards towards the brow bone
to intensify the lid color I'm just
going back into pure from the zareba
naturally doors palette and just placing
that right back onto the lid now I'm
just going to take this dark purple
color that we used earlier and sweep it
right along the lower lash line going
back into pure and highlighting my brow
bone next I'm picking up hardest or
tochi's however you want to actually I'm
a goat artist and I'm going to pick up
some of that cream liner with my zoeva
winged liner brush and I'm gonna create
my wings
for my mascara today I'm gonna use the
benefit bad gal lash I have a little sin
I'm getting a mascara all over my hand
by the way I am happy I'm gonna put on
my eyelashes these are from under using
them they're from the foxy lashes
they're imperfect lashes I have so many
other new eyelashes that I want to try
but these keep pulling me in because
they're so perf so I'm gonna do I'm
gonna put these on right now and then I
will get back to you and now we're done
with the eyes I'm going to move on to
the face and for the powder today I'm
going to use the hello flawless in beige
time I tanda this morning so I'm a
little bit darker today I'm gonna try to
do my face close-up today I get a lot of
comments about me being a little too far
away so I'm gonna try it out see if this
is good for you guys let me know in the
comments if it is or if it's too close I
think it'll be I think you guys will
like this better
now I'm gonna pick up some of that
champagne powder from hello flop or
benefit tell us all's then just brighten
up my under eyes and just anywhere that
I would like to highlight I don't have
my contour brush but I do have this one
which I haven't used in forever yeah so
we'll use this one this is the 127 luck
shear cheek brush we'll use that to
contour today using my old trusty
contour palette and then take the
contour color and just chisel out my
cheekbones
shapes and frames your face the way you
want it and Slim's it down a bit and
then and bring it up to the forehead
for the cheekbone highlight I'm using
the mary-lou manizer it gives you that
glowing within kind of look so I'm just
using my highlight brush on the top of
the cheekbone and you can just blend it
out with this brush here I want it to be
very subtle it's also a good highlight
for your eyes so I think I'm going to go
back and highlight my inner corners with
this it's really pretty
I'm just taking this smaller brush and
applying it a pop with applying the
highlight right in this inner corners
this brings light to your eyes and makes
them look more open and just makes it
look pretty for the lips today I'm going
to go with something new to concludes my
fav this is from Too Faced and it's in
nude beach
it's nothing starbursts using on
starburst now
for the Chiefs we Ares Oh for the cheeks
I'm gonna use this super cute blush from
Too Faced look at the packaging and then
this is the blush inside it has three
different colors and you turn like this

can see better I'm going to use my my
Luck's cheek finish brush and this is
