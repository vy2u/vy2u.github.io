ready for Coachella are you coming with
me I've been using this little guy a
bunch lately just because it's super
lightweight in ultra-hydrating so I've
been using that make up Trevor primer
like everyday and then for my foundation
I'm using the luminous silk foundation
just to even out my skin tone and cover
things up I got it I got this because of
a more easy on Instagram her skin looks
amazing so that's why I got it for my
under eye circles I'm using the Naked
skin from Urban Decay to cover them up
and also I also use this as a base
highlighter because it's very
lightweight as well so if you haven't
tried this out you definitely need to
try this concealer out
for my brows I'm using the pomade in ash
Brown here and I'm just gonna place it
right on the sparse areas of my brows
where I barely have any hair just to
even them out and make them look full
and then I'm taking the bon-voyage it's
a new palette from the balm and I'm
taking this color here I'm gonna sweep
it right into the crease just to give
myself some natural def and then I'm
gonna take this very pale beige color
here and I'm going to place it right on
the lid and right on the brow bone just
to give myself a natural highlight right
in those areas
this is darker color here and place it
right on the outer crease and sweep it
softly sweep it inwards not all the way
and then I'm also going to sweep it on
the lower half of the bottom lashline
and I usually stop on the lower half of
the bottom lashline you guys hear me say
I'll say that a lot and that's just
because the way my eyes are shaped
they're more like kind of close together
so it helps kind of bring them out and
then I'm taking this waterproof cream
color from Anastasia and I'm gonna put
that on the lower half of my bottom lash
line and just to add a pop of color and
then for my liner I'm just going to take
my Mac liner and do that I have tons of
videos where I'm actually showing you
the steps of my winged liner so I
decided to skip that today these are my
ikonics from house of lashes I got these
because of desi Perkins and crispy
makeup super comfortable and now I'm
going to take this blue mascara
you
and then I see a lot of people doing
this so I wanted to try it out so I've
never done this before but I'm taking
this milk pencil from NYX and making
these little circles on the tops of my
brows and then I took a glitter and I
filled it in with glitter usually I've
seen these just plain white but I
decided to add some glitter to it to
jazz it up and then I'm taking this
bronzer here from the same palette and
applying it to my cheeks also on along
the forehead and also going to contour
my nose with it there you go now my nose
looks a little bit straight straighter
than what it did and now I'm going to
add this um urban decay luminous
highlighter it's super glittery make it
look more Coachella esque this is a
matte lipstick from gerard cosmetics
it's in black cherry and I'm going to
fill in my lips with it and that's it
that is the completed look now I'm going
to curl my hair with my wand this is a
32 long journey and I'm just doing that
all over and then I'm just going to
fluff it up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
