that looks so good oh I just want to go
to bed a cuddle oh no I have to wash my
face boba face
Oba no matter how tired I am I make my
way I force myself to the restroom to
take off my makeup it's so important for
you to take off your makeup at the end
of the day so here I'm using the
Clinique take the day off balm which is
absolutely amazing if you follow me on
snapchat you know I have been obsessed
with using this every night to take off
my makeup literally just dissolves all
of your makeup off of your face it's
completely just sliding around and
breaking apart which I love and then I
just rinse because it gets kind of messy
and then I go back in I and I break
apart more of the make and you can see
that the mascara and the eyeliners just
coming off just go ahead and rinse off
some more and with the eye makeup I go
ahead and take a wipe just to really
just slide off the eye makeup that's all
you need to do is just wipe it off and
it's gone your face is like brand-new I
love it so after all the makeups off I
go ahead and cleanse I'm using the
foaming sonic facial soap with the sonic
system purifying cleansing brush and
this is going to wash off all the
impurities all the dirt from the day and
if you have any makeup left over which I
highly doubt this will also help take it
off I like that this brush is angled it
moves along the contours of your face
very easy like my neck I like to go all
the way down my neck because I put my
foundation down here so it's really good
to get down to your neck and then it
vibrates so it's like giving your face a
little mini facial massage
so next I'm going to exfoliate my skin
and here I'm using the clarifying lotion
I do this pretty often it removes the
dead skin on my face and this is going
to also allow all of the lotions and the
treatments that you're going to put on
your face afterwards to really soak into
your skin every time I'm done with this
step I always dry my face with my hands
it just feels really cool and it feels
really good so I always do that and then
I'm going to use the Clinique
dramatically different lotion I use this
on my face before I start applying my
serums Haley I've been using serums on a
nightly basis I've just made it my
routine this is a smart custom Repair
Serum that I've been using it's great
for damaged skin somebody who has a lot
of texture or acne scarring it's going
to help even out those areas and really
firm the skin so I have been obsessed
with this I'll use the Clinique Moisture
Surge overnight mask and this is deeply
moisturizing it really gets into your
skin it plumps it you instantly feel
that that's why I keep using it it
actually makes my skin look and feel
healthy and firm you guys have to go
check them out at cleaning comm also our
nighttime routines would be twinning so
then there's that and now I'm ready to
go to bed guys I'm so happy that I'm
going to bed with a clean face and I'll
be ready for tomorrow I love you guys so
much and until the next video bye
