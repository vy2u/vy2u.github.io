I'm going to be showing you how I get
unready for the night
my bedtime and skincare makeup and
little routine so the first thing I do
want to get into my personnel take the
bags out that I've had for the day
because they change on my purse pretty
often I usually have a hand cream of
some kind and some Sony's I like to
carry as minimal makeup as I can and I
usually have it in one of these small
glam bags from Ipsy since I get a new
one every month it's fun to change it
out I usually carry a face powder a lip
gloss for hydration this one is from
Tarte it's the lip surgence skin to
ative lip gloss it looks bright pink but
it's actually clear and it's supposed to
respond to your skin's natural pH and
energy and give you a personalized tint
I have my favorite flavor gum from orbit
the strawberry one is so amazing you
need this gum if you like sweet stuff I
also have a powder brush in this Marc
Anthony nourishing argan oil of Morocco
oil treatment just to add some moisture
and shine to my hair because my hair can
get pretty dry looking sometimes and
that's pretty much what I carried in my
bag today and then I head over and take
my shoes off and wind down here I'm just
removing my jewelry I've had this watch
for about three years I think and I
still wear it like it's brand new I just
love it so much I can't get tired of it
head over to change into my comfy
clothes for the night now it's time to
remove my face and my hair that sounds
hilarious actually but it's true I'm
wearing my luck see hair extensions I've
been wearing them for a while now I
posted them on my Instagram a ton so
obvious test with them I just love the
fullness it gives my hair and it matches
perfectly I'm in the shade dirty blonde
in case you guys were wondering and
these are the 20 inch extensions
I always keep these two webs clipped
together because I wear them all the
time make sure to brush them out with my
wet brush because it's very gentle on
the hair and then I tie them up
and then I place them back in their box
just so that they don't get tangled and
they last longer
now I'm brushing my real hair and
putting it in a pony so it's out of my
face when I wash my face and it's not so
crazy when I wake up oh my gosh I love
this part peeling off my lashes is one
of the best feelings thumbs up if you
can relate to remove my makeup I use the
Neutrogena makeup remover wipes I've
been using these for years and in my
opinion they are the best wipes I have
ever tried and I have tried a lot of
them I use one for my eyes and another
to remove my face makeup because my eye
makeup can be pretty heavy to wash my
face I use the Dermalogica clear start
foaming wash I just take a small amount
in my hand and work it into my face and
really helps with clearing out my
breakouts and it's very gentle on the
skin so I always keep going back to this
face wash
tonight I'm trying a new face mask I
usually do one once a week this one is
the Jawara tumeric radiance mask and
it's supposed to detoxify brighten and
strengthen stressed dull looking skin
and it's a cream formula so it feels
like a lotion and you just let it sit
for about 10 minutes and then wash it
away this did leave my skin feeling a
baby soft so I will be using this again
after I wash that off I apply a night
cream of some kind tonight I'm going to
be using the one from The Fresh Group
it's the good night night cream this
cream is great for sensitive dry
combination skin so I was excited to try
it because that's all me right there I
have dry sensitive sometimes combination
skin so I used that I applied it to my
face and my neck forwards I brush my
teeth
and I wanted to also show you guys this
Rio Gio blossom and bloom ginseng biotin
volumizer volumizing blow-dry spray that
is a long name I used this last night
and it smells so refreshing extends the
time between washes so your hair stays
fresh smelling so fYI that's why I'm not
washing hair tonight afterwards I go and
play with my new baby cat her name is
boba I am officially introducing you
guys to her she is the sweetest kitty
ever and even though she looks pretty
playful here she can be pretty lazy and
cuddly most of her days which is exactly
what I've always wanted in a pet
super cute and
chill she's the best and I honestly
think she is the new baby grumpy cat
afterwards I head into bed to watch a
little Nick at Nite Fresh Prince is on
right now it's one of my favorites and
so is full house those have to be my two
old school favorite TV shows what are
your guys is old school faves let me
know in the comments and that's pretty
much my bedtime I love you guys so much
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you in the next video bye dollies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
