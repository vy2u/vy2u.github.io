and now I'm just gonna cut out here is
my little backpack makeup I bring with
me on my little set oh I'm gonna go home
and wash off all my makeup and that's
probably the one of the my favorite
parts in the day of just like taking off
my lashes and washing
here we part our ways we're gonna go and
get comfortable get into our pajamas and
I'm taking my shoes off here this is my
extra shoe space I've created for myself
because I have no more room in my closet
so I like to keep it pretty neat since
this can get pretty cluttered and so I
just make sure that they're nice and
neat and then I grab my pajama bottoms
these are my favorite pajama bottoms
right now they're from my mom my mom got
him through me for my birthday so thank
you mom they're super cute they have
little purple in pink hearts and then I
just realized I have a load of coats
right there so we're just gonna act like
that's not even there and now I'm going
to put on my most favorite shoes that I
own these are the target fuzzy boots
slippers and they're super comfy
now I make my way out to the living room
to help Jaden look over his homework he
actually does his homework before he
gets home but I like to look over it
make sure he knows what's up with the
homework and then we have our little
time where we like chat about school and
just look at cartoons and here I'm just
gonna get comfortable and take off all
of my accessories I like to put them in
this little trinket tray I got from my
friend Hart and I just put all my little
things like little jewelry's I use
pretty much up on a daily basis this is
my tiny makeup collection in my restroom
so there's more in my bedroom which is
sad but true but kind of a makeup junkie
and now I'm just gonna put up my hair
and get ready to wash my face to remove
my makeup lately I've been using the
ultra bland by lush this facial cleanser
is kind of funny because it feels really
waxy and it just doesn't feel like
something you would normally take your
makeup off with but you put this on top
of your makeup which is kind of weird
but it actually removes even waterproof
makeup the toughest makeup to remove it
completely removes it all you have to do
after you slather it on is you can get a
warm a very warm towel and start to take
off the makeup and it removes everything
just like that it's crazy
now it's time to really get my skin
clean that what I've been using and
absolutely loving is evite a good spin
for perfect skin brush it has for a
different type of replacement heads it
comes with the bigger one is for your
body and I like to choose that one in
the shower and then there's a stone one
that's really good for it's fo leading
your feet and then there are two smaller
ones are for your face and I like the I
like both of them one of them really
exfoliates because it's more dense and
then the other is
very soft brush and that's what I'm
gonna be using today with a softer brush
and I just clip it on it's super easy
and then take a cleanser any kind of
cleanser and lately I've just been using
this one apply it to the brush head and
I'll run it over some water I'll start
to run it over my face and you just
press the button and it spins and it
feels like it's just sucking out all of
those nasty and charities out of my face
it gives me a really good thorough clean
it removes all the excess oils that
caused clogged pores which happens to me
easily because you know I like my cone
based primers so I like to use this
little guy just feels like a little
vacuum clearing up all of those
impurities and actually prevents future
breakouts
the only thing about my face is that I
broke out this past weekend I had a
little bit of a lengthy date I'm always
twist it lasts a day and it lasts to two
days and I had dairy I'm allergic to
dairy and breaks me out I know this but
the boba is just hard to resist
sometimes so that's just a personal
problem but it's super amazing this
thing has been a skin lifesaver to the
point now that if I don't use it I feel
like my skin is just isn't as clean as
it should be so I'll have a link below
where you guys can check it out and I'll
also include a discount code for you
guys to save to and then I just dry my
face off after I use it and then take my
triple performing emulsion by benefit
and I just love like all their parks do
it not only because their packaging is
super cute but they are actually really
high-end quality facial products the
total moisture facial cream is
definitely my hands-down favorite
moisturizer it just feels like you're
putting on a plushy pillow all over your
face for my under eyes I'm using the
night cream from Benefit and I really
pack that stuff on let it sit in my face
until the morning
and after that I brush my teeth and then
just put on some lip balm so that my
lips stay moisturized I go ahead and put
my Jayden bear to bed tell him he's
gonna have a good day tomorrow and then
I head over to my room to have some me
time and here I go ahead and check all
my social media my Instagram see what's
up on there and then I go on Twitter
relief notifications I have and
everybody's new posts and then my most
favorite is snapchat I created my
snapchat specifically for my fans and
this is the pencil hi Christa I love
your videos yeah I just took my lashes
off too and I looked like you know I
don't care that I also like to use
videos and after all that I take my
journal it's really cute it has polka
dots and it has like a positive message
on the front so I thought that was nice
and I just write out my days I don't do
this every night but lately you've been
doing it and it's very therapeutic
I love ending my night like this and
then I just go to that and that's it i
hope this was my routine I love you guys
so much and I will see you in my next
video bye Dolly's sees every would you
