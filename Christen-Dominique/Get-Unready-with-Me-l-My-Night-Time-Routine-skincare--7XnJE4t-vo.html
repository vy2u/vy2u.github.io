and now I'm just going to cut out here
is my little backpack makeup I bring
with me on my little set
well my candle oh I'm going to go home
and wash off all my makeup and that's
probably the one of the my favorite
parts in the day just like taking off my
lashes and washing
good here we part our ways we're gonna
go and get comfortable get into our
pajamas and I'm taking my shoes off here
this is my extra shoe space I've created
for myself because I have no more room
in my closet so I like to keep it pretty
neat since this can get pretty cluttered
and so I just make sure that they're
nice and neat and then I grab my pajama
bottoms these are my favorite pajama
bottoms right now they're from my mom my
mom got them for me for my birthday
thank you mom they're super cute they
have little purple in pink hearts and
then I just realized I have a load of
coats right there so we're just gonna
act like that's not even there and now
I'm going to put on my most favorite
shoes that I own these are the target
fuzzy boots slippers and they're super
comfy
now I make my way out to the living room
to help Jaden look over his homework he
actually does his homework before he
gets home but I like to look over it
make sure he knows what's up with the
homework and then we have our little
time where we like chat about school and
just look at cartoons and here I'm just
gonna get comfortable and take off all
of my accessories I like to put them in
this little trinket tray I got from my
friend Hart and I just put all my little
things like little jewelry's I use
pretty much up on a daily basis this is
my tiny makeup collection in my restroom
so there's more in my bedroom which is
sad but true
a kind of a makeup junkie and now I'm
just gonna put up my hair and get ready
to wash my face to remove my makeup
lately I've been using the ultra bland
by lush this facial cleanser is kind of
funny because it feels really waxy and
it just doesn't feel like something you
would normally take your makeup off with
but you put this on top of your makeup
which is kind of weird but it actually
removes even waterproof makeup the
toughest makeup to remove it completely
removes it all you have to do after you
slather it on you get a warm a very warm
towel and start to take off the makeup
and it removes everything just like that
it's crazy now it's time to really get
my skin clean what I've been using and
absolutely loving is the vitae good spin
for perfect skin brush it has four
different type of replacement heads it
comes with the bigger one is for your
body and I like to choose that one in
the shower and then there's a stone one
that's really good for exfoliating your
feet and then the two smaller ones are
for your face and I like the I like both
of them one of them really exfoliates
because it's more dense and then the
other is a very soft brush and that's
what I'm going to be using today the
softer brush and I just
clip it on super-easy and then take a
cleanser any kind of cleanser and lately
I've just been using this one apply it
to the brush head and I'll run it over
some water I'll start to run it over my
face and you just press the button and
it spins and it feels like it's just
sucking out all of those nasty and
Quixote's out of my face it gives me a
really good thorough clean it removes
all the excess oils that cause clogged
pores which happens to me easily because
you know I like my silicone based
primers so I like to use this little guy
just feels like a little vacuum clearing
up all of those impurities and actually
prevents future breakouts the only thing
about my face is that I broke out this
past weekend I had a little bit of a
lengthy cheat date I'm only supposed to
it lasts a day and it lasts to two days
and I had dairy I'm allergic to dairy
and it breaks me out I know this but the
boba is just hard to resist sometimes so
that's just a personal problem but it's
super amazing this thing has been a skin
lifesaver to the point now that if I
don't use it I feel like my skin is just
isn't as clean as it should be so I'll
have a link below where you guys can
check it out and I'll also include a
discount for you guys to save too and
then I just dry my face off after I use
it and then take my triple performing
emulsion by benefit and I just love like
all their products do it not only
because their packaging is super cute
but they're actually really high-end
quality facial products the total
moisture facial cream is definitely my
hands-down favorite moisturizer just
feels like you're putting on a plushy
pillow all over your face for my under
eyes I'm using the night cream from
benefit and I really pack that stuff on
let it sit in my face until the morning
and after that I brush my teeth and then
just put on some lip balm so that my
lips stay moisturized I go ahead and put
my Jade in there to bed tell him he's
going to have a
tomorrow and then I head over to my room
to have some mini time and here I go
ahead and check all my social media my
Instagram see what's up on there and
then I go on Twitter relief
notifications I have and everybody's new
posts and then my most favorite is
snapchat I created my snapchat
specifically for my fans and this is the
title
hi Kristin I love your videos yay I just
took my lashes off too and I looked like
you know and I don't care either I also
like to use you guys videos so yeah so
hit me up on snapchat and after all that
I take my journal it's really cute it
has polka dots and it has like a
positive message on the front so I
thought that was nice and I just write
out my days I don't do this every night
but lately you've been doing it and it's
very therapeutic
I love ending my night like this and
then I just go to bed and that's it this
was my routine I love you guys so much
and I will see you in my next video bye
