I'm here with my morning coffee and
these are my crazy coffee eyes today
you're getting ready with me to go to a
concert
like
and I also got my Ipsy bag in the mail
so I'm going to check out what makeup I
had to play with today starting out with
my saint-tropez face tanner for a
luminous sunkissed glow
to cover up my dark circles and
blemishes I'm gonna take my sheer cover
concealer in light medium and just Pat
that into my under eyes and around my
nose and any blemishes that I have for
the eyes I'm going to take my bronze
color from my lorac Pro to go palette
and just wash that into the crease
Oh
now I'm going to take my Elizabeth Mott
shadow in the champagne color and apply
it to my lips to brighten the inner
corners I'm taking my city color shadow
and highlight mousse it has a really
pretty gold Sheen finish and it's great
for brightening your cheekbones or your
brow bone but today I'm just going to
use it for my inner corners
next intaking 525 market from the
two-faced loves Sephora palette and just
focusing this directly on the crease and
then blending up with the fluffy brush
for a highlight I'm using the shell
color from the lorac Pro to go palette
and just applying that to my brow bone
and if you watch my videos you know I
use this a lot because I absolutely love
it I feel like it's a perfect
highlighter it's not shimmery or too
wide it's like the perfect neutral
highlight
now I'm gonna take this eyeliner marker
and we now at the top lash line and I do
my makeup on a regular basis I always do
winged liner
but you guys do not have to do the exact
look you can modify it however you want
now I'm just gonna take a black pencil
and apply that to my waterline and this
pencil in particular is my favorite from
Le girls because it's a gel pencil and
it glides on so smoothly and it's super
pigmented now I'm gonna go back in with
five to five market and just go right
underneath the black liner to smoke it
out a little bit and add some balance to
the eyes next I'm just curling my lashes
to prep them for mascara here I'm using
the Make Up For Ever mascara in a black
and just generously coat your lashes
I want to add some fullness to my lashes
so I'm going to take the kiss lashes in
flirty
they are so feathery and soft feeling
they feel like they're not even on your
eyes which is why I really liked the
kiss lashes especially these and it's
going to apply it to the center and then
attach one side at a time as I normally
do
this is why I love these lashes they're
so natural-looking that they add a
fullness to your eyes without being too
top-heavy now I'm going to use my
Pacifica mineral palette taking that
bronzer and applying that to the hollow
areas of my cheeks to define my
cheekbones
now I'm taking this dusty rose color
blush and applying that to the apples of
my cheeks for the lips I'm taking my
Kahlan tinted a lip balm in the color
apple pink and using the built in brush
to apply it to my lips
and this is the final look I hope you
enjoyed the video as much as I enjoyed
making it for you guys don't forget to

until the next video bye Dolly's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
