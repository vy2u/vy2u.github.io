what I need it time to get right
oh my heart's so I'm going to start off
with my hair it's already put halfway up
and it's kind of tingly so I'm just
going to brush it out and then I'm going
to take my nume 32 inch curling wand and
curl the rest of my hair just taking a
piece curling it around the wand and
letting it sit for a little bit and then
maybe like five seconds and then let it
go and you have yourself a bouncy curl
so I'm just going to do that all around
my hair and yeah just repeat the process
boom our buddy need Zach with you and we
can negotiate with my a Loxy hair serum
I'm gonna smooth out the frizzies and
this also protects the hair from any UV
damage so this works great we came out
in LA and it's super super hot and sunny
out here now to lock in those curls I'm
gonna take my sexy hairspray and play
hairspray and lightly spritz it around
my hair I've already applied my
foundation and concealer and so now I'm
going to Pat on a powder to the parts of
my face that normally are on more the
oily side and areas that need a bit more
coverage
now I'm going to contour my face using
my city color contour effects palette
taking the darkest color in the palette
and just contouring the hollows of my
cheekbones and the temples to make my
face seemed a bit slimmer and define my
features next I'm going to take the
bronze color in the palette to add
warmth to the face with a highlight
color I'm going to add brightness to the
high points of my face to give a healthy
glowing appearance now we're going to
pop up our lashes to prepare them for
mascara taking my Naked 2 palette I'm
using the color foxy as a base all over
the lid now I'm taking the color tees
and washing it into the crease to add a
natural death to die
but
next I'm using the color snakebite I'm
going to add it to the crease extending
it out into a wing shape that we're
actually going to blend out so that you
get a nice haze
your English
you know what good a shot
next I'm picking up our highlight color
which is apt white frosted color that
has a really funny name so I'm just
taking that putting it on the brow bone
and blending downwards into the other
colors I want my lower lash line to kind
of glow and so I'm going to take the
color chopper and apply it to the outer
half of the lower lash line to add
definition to the eyes I'm going to take
my la girls gel pencil in black and
apply it to the waterline now I'm just
adding a winged liner to the top lash
line next I'm applying generous coats of
my lorac pro mascara to the top and
bottom lashes to add a length and
fullness I'm going to pop on some Ardell
wispy lashes love it 11 blogging love
I'm going to take my liquid liner and go
back over the top of the lash line to
hide any blue marks now I'm going into
Pro to go palette using the blush color
coral and applying that to my cheekbone
for a nice glow next I'm applying my
Mirabella velvet lip pencil in the color
blush and topping the center off with a
lip concealer to give your lip dimension
and a fuller look without actual lip
liner this is the final look I hope you
