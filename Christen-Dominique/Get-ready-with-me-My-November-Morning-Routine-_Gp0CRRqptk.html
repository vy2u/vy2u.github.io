in the city of Stars uh-huh the city of
lights and starry night I send a welcome
to city well good morning everyone
welcome to my November weekend morning
routine first thing I like to do when I
get up is head straight to the shower
I've kind of been going back to this but
I've been using the dial yogurt honey
body wash and the Tresemme anti-breakage
shampoo and conditioner they work really
well on my hair and after that I like to
use my built-in soap shaver it is a
miracle I love this little shaver and
then of course I use my deodorant from
secret and eucalyptus blossom then I
head over to my sink to brush my teeth
and I've been using the crest complete
with scope lately and am I the only one
who does this but after I put the
toothbrush on my brush I like to put it
in the water and then brush my teeth
it's just a habit I have and then I
clean my sink with my hands so
afterwards I'll go ahead and wash my
hands and I've been using my winter
cranberry hand soap from Bath and Body
Works I actually got six of them for $20
so I'm not sure if where you live they
had that but I stocked up on them
because I absolutely loved the holiday
so after my hands are clean I go in with
my nearad daily cleanser and wash my
face and for my hair I'll use my thirty
two millimeter wand from nume it works
amazing I love this and use it almost
every day and after I'm done with my
hair I'll go out open my blinds let the
Sun Shine in and head over to grab my
Glade apple cinnamon spray this just
makes it feel like the holidays are here
I love this spray after I'm done
spraying my room it smells a really nice
go to my computer and put on my Pandora
and lately I've been listening to
emblem3 radio and it plays all these
really soothing cool songs that I
enjoy because a bright future reflects
off on the Aviators which is if we're
breakfast - Pecola pebbles the chocolate
ones are so good they turn my milk
chocolatey and it just it's delicious as
you can see I'm using lactaid milk
because my tummy is special get on my
Instagram and check what is up for the
day who's putting up what and looking at
all of their beautiful pictures now that
I'm done with breakfast I'll go ahead
and head over to my vanity first I like
my cinnamon and spice candle and then
I'll start applying my concealer my
powder and getting my face ready for the
day now I'm going to set my lips using
my M by Michelle Phan pillow plush
cushiony lip balm and berries which came
in this nonstick sea bag just let that
sit and moisturize while I finish the
rest of my face makeup now I'm just
lightly filling in my brows with my my
bit dark brown
going to put on some eyeliner and I
always do that cat shape I like that
feline effected your plan
I'm gonna go for a subtly smoked out
bottom lashline so for that I'm going to
take my BH Cosmetics galaxy chic baked
eyeshadow in asteroid and just apply
that to the lower lash line and then I'm
going to take my star luxe gem eye
pencil and amethyst apply this to the
inner corners and inner half of the lash
line
I'm going to define my lower lashline by
applying a black pencil liner to the
waterline then I'm just applying
generous coats of mascara to the upper
and bottom lashes now I'm just applying
my kiss ever easy lashes from the lash
double pack first I like to lay my
eyelashes down on the center of my lash
line and then attach either side one at
a time and then with tweezers
I'll mesh my real lash to my falsies for
a more realistic look and then of course
I'll go back over with a black liner to
hide the glue to give me a nice fall lip
I'll go ahead and apply might be a
bombshell lip crayon in shameless
and to finish off the look I'm going to
apply a natural flush of color to my
cheeks this is from LA girls and I
believe the color is rose next I'm going
to apply a metallic shade of Polish this
is from nail tini straight-up nail
lacquer in the color caviar cocktail I
love my women like I love my jewels now
that we're done with the makeup onto the
outfit today I'm wearing this graphic
tee from bat house design and these long
boots distressed jeans and this really
cute jacket that I absolutely adore I'm
in love with the zipper details and the
button details I totally tried to seem
like I didn't have my glasses on but I
need them to see what I'm that far
garage look oh my god where is she I'm
down to blue contacts just to see what
it would look like so there goes another
option for you but anyways I hope you
enjoyed this video as much as I enjoyed
making it for you until the next time
bye dollies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
