channel today we're doing a girls night
out completed look I'm doing the makeup
gonna do some nail art for the first
time for you guys was kind of scary but
I think it came out pretty good and
outfit um I haven't had a girls night
out in a really long time but I thought
it'd be fun to do this look for you I
hope you guys enjoy it today I'm going
to start off with the nails and first
I'm applying the Londontown
cur and nail hardener and this is going
to help my weak nails from breaking and
once that's on I'm gonna pick up this
gorgeous bluish purple color it's called
- the queen with love and I'm gonna
paint all of my nails this color except
for the ring fingers I noticed the
Polish leaves your nails with this ultra
glossy shine which I really like and
originally I was going to do one accent
nail but I decided to do two so that's
why the ring finger is blue now and will
be a different color later
for the ring finger I'm gonna apply a
cool taupe shade and this is in the
color chimes of the city all of the nail
polishes from London town are vegan
gluten-free and most importantly to me
they're cruelty free so that definitely
makes my heart happy I'm going to use a
nail polish remover pen to wipe away any
mistakes but you can also use acetone in
a thin brush to get into those
hard-to-reach areas now it's time for
the nail design and here I'm taking the
blue I used earlier just pouring some
onto the foil as well as this brown
shade it's in the color pens by the
pound and I'm going to take this wood
stick nail tool or you can use a
toothpick if you don't have one of these
and just create tiny C shapes and you
want to face them in different
directions and it doesn't have to be
perfect to seize I think it helps make
it look a little bit more realistic I
have to say I'm pretty impressed with
this nail polish line because usually I
do gels because my nails are so weak and
I don't like the look of chipped polish
and usually I don't have the time to
redo them myself but this look lasted me
a full week with no chipping so this
just makes me want to try more colors
and designs so now I have this newfound
interest in nail art and nail polish and
here I'm just filling in the open spaces
with dots and tiny messy lines and this
looks pretty good just how it is so you
can leave it like this or you can add
the blue dots like I did in the center
of the C's and you know what guys I am
such a beginner at this kind of stuff
but I wanted to try something different
on my channel for you guys so I called
up my friend Janelle or Ellen dish and
she gave me this idea so if you're a
beginner like me you definitely can do
this so try it out don't be afraid it's
super fun and now I just want to do more
designs
and I wanted to see how easy it was to
use a tiny brush instead of the dotting
tool so I just grabbed a tiny brush and
dotted the blue into the center so you
can do either or whatever's easiest for
you guys now I'm using the top coat and
this is going to seal everything
together and make it look even more
glossy err and let me know what you guys
think I was happy with the outcome
considering I am a super super beginner
status now for the makeup I'm going to
pick up the color rewind from the Urban
Decay vice 2 palette and I'm going to
apply this more heavily on the inner and
outer corners of the eyes and lightly
Pat a small amount onto the center of
the lids
once we get out towards the ends I'm
going to create a cat eye with the
shadow using the same shader brush with
a clean blending brush I'm going to
soften just underneath the wing with the
same eyeshadow and shader brush I'm
going to bring it down to the lower half
of the bottom lashline for the center of
the lids I'm gonna add this frost peach
color to highlight the eyes next I'm
taking this satin champagne color to
highlight my brow bone and inner corners
and then I'm going to flip my brush
around to the fluffy side to blend it
down into the other colors next I'm
going to take this golden bronze blush
and wash this onto the top of the crease
and lightly blend the edges into the
taupe color but you still want to see
that bronze color peeking through the
top
line my top lash line I'm going to use
my current favorite liquid liner from
the balm it's called Schwing and I'm
just gonna create a small flick towards
the end I literally pretended to hit or
baseball right now just you know just
like that over there to lengthen my
lashes I'm going to use the Urban Decay
perversion mascara to the top and bottom
lashes just applying a few coats if this
ever happens to you guys don't freak out
and try to wipe it off right away let it
dry for a little bit so that it doesn't
smear and it just wipes right off next
I'm going to apply some wispy lashes and
I will list the exact brand name in the
description box and for the cheeks and
using a bronzy blush and I'm going to
apply that to the apples of the cheeks
sweeping back into the hairline next I'm
going to add some a light to my face by
applying this powder highlight to the
tops of my cheekbones and down the
bridge of my nose next I'm applying my
Gerard cosmetics lipstick and nude and
then going over it with a pinky nude lip
gloss and this is the final look I hope
