today I'm going to be showing you how to
get this easy spring orange lip makeup
look that looks beautiful on any skin
tone and that's one of the reasons why I
love this look so much especially the
lip I am obsessed and dying over this
lip it's absolutely stunning I'm super
excited for this video because I've
teamed up with me to technology for the
make up plus app which is an amazing app
where you can actually get upload a
picture of yourself with no makeup on
and then put a makeup filter over that
you can try different lip colors eye
shadows it's so so fun also really love
that the app is showing that you can get
ultra glam and you can try any look that
you can imagine and it's okay because
makeup is fun makeup is an art and it's
a way we express ourselves I feel like
it's so much of makeup shaming is still
out there it's online it's in person
body shaming makeup shaming it's it's
out there and it's time for us to stick
together and lift each other up I really
love that this app is donating to the
women empowerment organizations when
someone uploads an Instagram photo with
the hashtag she unites and it uses the
she unites filter over their face it
shows that you can be bold and beautiful
and you can want to try it any look that
you want you'll confident and beautiful
in this makeup and
that's all that matters so I want to
share with you guys this look right here
that I've created for spring and it's
beautiful universally beautiful on every
skin tone I hope you guys enjoy this
video and listen so for the foundation
I'm going to be using this Make Up For
Ever Ultra HD foundation stick it's
super easy to apply I know it's super
full coverage it makes my skin look
really good and it's so quick so this is
my go-to for when I need a really nice
full coverage and it's quick so I'm just
putting that all over my face and no
specific order just get it on there and
then down my neck so we don't look like
our head is detached from our bodies
take this is the Sigma 3 day sponge
which I really like and I've been using
a lot lately to bake and to for
foundation concealer everything I will
have the link in the description in case
you guys are wondering where to get it
and going to go ahead and start working
that into my skin just using patting
motions we are going inside the shirt
guys I'm going to take light 2.5 Cannell
and just conceal my under eyes and this
is the NARS creamy radiant concealer let
me go ahead and do my eye shadow for the
eye shadow I'm going to be using the Too
Faced peanut butter honey palette it's
so cute
Too Faced always kills it with a sense
they're amazing I want to eat the
package I just want to eat this what
some may go wrong angles let some Tyee I
freaking love this scent of this palette
the colors are really nice I feel like I
use these colors probably probably every
single day so the first color that I'm
going to pick up is this book the first
color my pick up is creamed honey this
shade right here I'm going to put that
all over the lid
the next color I'm going to pick up is
peanut butter this color right here and
I'm going to use a Lexi 231 brush to
pick that up and work this in the crease
like so just using short circular
motions so as I'm working it out to the
brow bone I'm going to bring it in to
the out
part of the lashline super close to the
lashline just really working it in there
washing it through the crease I want the
color to focus on the outer part of the
crease I want to leave the lid portion
nice and bright
the next color I'm going to pick up is
feeling nutty so I'm going to take the
same brush pop into that color and just
start to work that into the same area
but we want to get it low enough so that
that peanut butter shade peeks through
so I'm going to work that color into the
crease all the way to the outer part of
the lash line kind of creating this
v-shape right here but you still want
peanut butter to show through so try to
keep it pretty low so that you form that
gradient I'm gonna pick up honey brittle
and we'll work that into the crease as
well a lot of different colors going on
in our crease trust me the subtle hints
of different shades make a huge
difference in the end when you're
working with eyeshadow so I'm going to
take honey brittle and I'm going to
start to work that through the creases
well now I'm going into the darkest
shade in the palette which is going nuts
and I'm going to take that into the
crease really close to the crease so
right in there this is where you're
really going to show your the definition
in your eyes I'm grabbing a concealer
and I'm just going to clean the brow
bone up and brighten it up a bit as well
and work that into the other shades I'm
gonna pick up this mascara right here
from Maybelline's is the colossal Big
Shot and I'm just gonna coat my lashes
for falsies on this look to be about the
lashes and the lips this lash always
does this to me it always stands out
never works with me it's always like
this I am very this is the reason why
I'm very tempted to get my lashes permed
like curled up because this little guy
right here I don't want to take them out
as I'm scared these are nice oh my god
these are so so pretty so I'm just gonna
put these lashes on really quick and I
will be right back so for the lower lash
line I'm going to take this luck c-141
mini round brush
and I'm going to pick up that honey
brittle shade really pretty peachy
orange shade I'm going to work that on
the lower lash line and then I'm going
to go in with feeling and nutty and just
go right on top of that orange shade and
then with a clean brush I'm just going
to sweep through there make sure every
edge is softened and I'm working it
upwards so that it connects with the
crease when you sweep up like this it
just gives your eye the illusion that
it's a little bit more lifted so if you
just sweep your eyeshadow upwards and
then towards your brow bone I'm going to
take this black liner from math it's
called a graphic black and I'm just
going to line the upper I'm going to
tightline right in here I never can get
used to tight lining my eyes it always
tickles so bad it makes my eyes water
we're going to try to do this really
fast here we go okay that wasn't too bad
I have these individual lashes from
blink and I think I'm going to put them
on my lower lash line I'm just going to
see how it looks that looks cute I think
I'm going to keep going with the lower
lashes I'm just putting them in the
sparse areas sitting them up
I'm just popping on about four lashes
and then we are gonna let them get tacky
and sit for a little bit all right so I
popped on all of the lower lashes they
are super PC and flared out which I
really like I'm gonna take that going
nuts shade and smudge it very close to
the lower lash line just to fill in
those little gaps I think this guy right
here is going to be too much so I'm
going to take her out take both of them
out we're no longer needed so I'm just
going to go over with a black liner and
I have this black liner here from Kat
Von D just going to go over the glue to
cover it up just for a little bit of a
brighter pop I'm going to go ahead and
take these knees this is actually a
pretty vibrant orange color I'm just
going to work it on the lower lash line
I'm just going to dab it right back and
forth on the lower lash line and then
blend it out with our big fluffy brush
I'm going to take a little bit of this
amazing gorgeous color from Stila I love
love love these have been playing with
these so much they're called the
Magnificent metals glitter and glow
liquid eyeshadows literally like goddess
heaven in a bottle it's so so gorgeous
let me just tell you how gorgeous it is
I'm going to take that on this brush
right here and just brush it into the
inner corners now I'm going to work on
the rest of my face I'm gonna start off
with contouring I used my Y 5:05 this is
kind of like my handy dandy contour it's
like my go-to it's the one of the ultra
HD foundations and what I do is just
take it right on the cheekbone like that
on both sides and right down the nose
and then with my Sigma F 6-1 brush I
just smooth everything out
now I'm going to set my under eyes with
the shade and light contour palette
taking these two shades right here and
I'm just going to set my under eyes and
pop them right underneath my eyes to set
everything in place
this kind of brightens them up just a
tad bit more so that's why I kind of
like kind of love this palette because
these two shades are perfect for my
under eyes and then I'll just hit around
my mouth just to brighten it up a little
bit just to get pretty dark in that area
even though I've contoured my nose I go
back over it with the powder contour and
I'll just go down my nose like that kind
of intensify this shape brush the
contour down the sides of brush the
contour down the sides of the nose
actually I'm going to go in with this
NARS a liquid blush in lustre I like
that this is more of a warm tone corley
shade it fits the look perfectly they
blend really nicely into the skin BAM
blush and I like that it took a little
bit on the warm side so it gives us more
of a tan look for the bronzer to add
some really nice bronze warmth to our
face I'm going to go in with this
bronzer it's called valises looks like
so to warm up the face now I'm going to
go over it with this color pop Candyman
highlight then I'm going to go over the
top with this Oprah highlight and Rodeo
Drive
now my highlight mustache is poppin and
for the star of the show I'm going to
take max more inge this really vibrant
orange color and pop it on to the lid
