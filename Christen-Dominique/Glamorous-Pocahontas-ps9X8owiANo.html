Pocahontas book for you and this is a
lamp Pocahontas because I don't think
she wears that much makeup so um it's
just a really bronzed sunkissed dewy lip
look it's very glam very pretty I like
it I'm gonna wear it out in a normal day
I'm going to look just like that so I'll
be Pocahontas for today so yes this is
one of my this is going to be my first
Halloween tutorial and the next one's
will be scary trust me but we're gonna
have all kinds of different Halloween
tutorials for you this 2012 year so what
I used for my airbrush makeup is this
airbrush by Luminess air finally did the
video with it
yeah I've had this for awhile but I've
been meaning to do a video with it I
really do actually like it the coverage
is really awesome so I'm just going to
show you how I applied my flawless face
and then I'll get into the eye makeup
for Pocahontas so if you like this look
then continue watching I want to go for
more tan look so I'm going to use k2 and
shape 3 that's the medium and medium
almost our darkest color that they have
to shoot em-up really important to do
that and then after we've done that
we're going to take the stylus and going
to put in shade to just a medium color
about halfway and then I'm going to take
the shade 3 it's the darkest color
and then I'm just going to shake them
around it's going to kind of mix in
you're tapping it here we go
the coverage is amazing
and this is actually my favorite part
early next to the foundation the
brighter is my favorite because royalty
and the brightener is a highlighter it's
called brightening glow in g1 you'll use
this as your highlighter and I like I
like putting this right on
the top of Michiko
I'm going to take the bronzer
the bronzer has this really nice olden
olden look to it
bronzor
come in a little bit
she gets
I'm just going to do my eyebrows I'll be
right back okay so what I did with my
eyebrows is just rounded them out in the
front longer to kind of give you give
the effect of Pocahontas eyebrows
I'm going to take my brush in a new
taking chopper I'm going to apply that
all over my lid all over your lid like
that
the other side
and because it had so much glitter and
it will just kind of get everywhere I
like to Pat it on I'm going to take T's
and we're just going to put it right
above my crease and start to work it
into the crease now I'm going to take a
darker Brown I'm going to be using
busted and a little bit of blackout look
that into the outer area of the crease
it's all blended out I'm going to go
back and just going to pack on some the
left
the highlight I'm going to use booty
call on each side
and as you can tell it opens up this
space and it's just a matte highlight
light under the crease
extra intense liquid pencil eyeliner it
is so dark so I'm going to take that and
apply it on the lower waterline
so now that we're done with that I'm
gonna just take my my powder from like
the makeup I love it because it makes
your face so you like flawless looking
I'm just gonna put it right under my my
circle area
just like hokey brush yes
blendin
Honus does have big juicy bullets

and I'm gonna just line my lips is
sweetheart
