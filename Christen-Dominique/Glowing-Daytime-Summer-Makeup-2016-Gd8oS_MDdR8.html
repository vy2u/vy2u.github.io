hey guys welcome back to my channel
since today I'm going to be doing this
daytime summer makeup look it's so glowy
I am in love with it because it is using
one of my favorite palettes right now
which is by my friend Laura Lee the
volleyballs palette um and all of the
shades are so cute I love the names of
the shades are so Laura they're funny
and just adorable
Romberg pissed pot and ragamuffin I can
use all day long every single day on my
crease I am looking forward to all the
summer looks
I love being bronzed I love being glowy
no matter what season it is I want to be
bronzed and I want to be glowy I'm
excited for this summer is it already
summer it's perfect for a daytime summer
look and I think you're going to really
love it so if you want to learn how to
get it then keep watching this video
start your makeup you always want to
make sure your skin is nice and hydrated
so that your makeup goes on top of a
nice smooth surface so I'm gonna do is
put on this hey honey
24/7 hey honey day and night
revitalizing moisturizing cream right
here and I'm gonna go ahead and just put
it all over my face
this cream right here I've never tried
it's from the Ipsy glam bag so I'm going
to be trying out some of the stuff from
the glam bag today so you'll see some
sample size things and those will be
from the glam bag hold on I didn't tell
you just updated my lens so if you
notice all if you think it's clear
please let me know in the comment or
what you think about this lens because I
love it I'm going to go ahead and just
jump right into my foundation since I've
already moisturize my skin I think it's
okay I'm going to be using this one it's
the number seven stay perfect foundation
and honey I'm trying to film at night
because I feel like there's less
construction going on next door somebody
has been building their house next door
for like ten years is currently ten
eleven just gonna bail
sit all over the thing about this
foundation is that it's supposed to wear
for about 17 hours that's a long time I
like that it feels like I'm not wearing
any foundation at all it feels really
comfortable on my skin so what I'm gonna
do is let my foundation is sit on my
skin it's a little wet feeling right now
so I'm just gonna let it kind of dry I'm
gonna work on my brows I'm gonna do that
off-camera and I will be right back with
you guys to work in the eye area of my
face concealer as a primer so I'm going
to use this booboo cover-up concealer
work that on my lids while we're at it
we'll just put a little bit down there
except with too much on my hand
all right so now that my eyes are set if
you're using a concealer sometimes it
doesn't dry as quick as an actual primer
for your eyes but it does do it does do
a nice job of covering up everything
making it look even so what I'm going to
do before I put on my eyeshadow apply
some powder I'm just going to take this
shade and light powder just work it all
over the lid so that your eyeshadow does
increase and it just kind of seals in
the concealer you just start from the
inner corner and then just work it
outwards now I'm ready for the eye
shadow I'm going to go ahead and use
this palette right here this is the
violet boss X Laura Lee palette all of
the shadows are super pigmented which is
going to take some of pris pot with this
vanity planet eyes shadow brush and then
I'm going to work it onto my lid all the
way up into the crease it just gives you
a nice pretty soft peach base and I love
peach shades for this summer
after that I'm going to go ahead and
take mama bird and do the same thing
just start at the base and then work it
up into the crease I still want to leave
some room I want pris pot to still show
through so make sure not to cover that
one up I was over at her house one day
and I actually made her go through each
one of these and tell me what which like
how did you get this one in this one she
went through every single one and showed
me like what each one means and it's
just the cutest thing ever but she said
this is how they talk in Alabama like
I'll show you grew up talking it's so
cute I think it's adorable the next
shade of intake is ragamuffin this nice
burnt orange right here lid and then
just work it into the crease when I go
ahead and move on to the brow bone which
I'm going to use basic right here and
work that onto the brow bone and packing
it on and then I'm blending it downwards
and see the other color so that
everything blends together and it looks
nice and soft and transitions really
nice so next I'm going to take this
shade right here this is fireball from
Urban Decay I just feel like it's going
to add a nice pop and just compliment
the orange really nicely so I'm going to
go ahead and take some of that on my
brush and work it onto my lid
and then I'm going to take the
ragamuffin on the to 5-3 brush and just
work it on to the lower part of the lid
as well sometimes what I like to do when
I want to blend the lower lashline I
just take my big fluffy brush and then I
just pinch it down like this and I just
blend it out because I still haven't
found a brush that just works as
perfectly as me pinching a brush I don't
know it's probably just me I'm just
weird but for me it just works better to
blend out the lower lash line with a
pinched fluffy brush then I'm going to
take this color pop eyeliner pencil this
is in the shade get paid looks like this
look how pretty that is so cute I'm
gonna go ahead and line my lower lash
line in my nail continues to fall off
see it's hanging on there I superglued
it just for this video for you guys it
fell off and I try to find super glue
and it kinda is working but you know
it's hanging on by a string it's like a
metallic rose gold it's so so pretty and
I'm just going to work it onto the lower
lash line and I just love the pop in the
light it gives to your bottom lash line
it's so pretty
when you see this it's literally hanging
on my string so now I'm just gonna line
the top lash line with a brown liner
this is the Lancome brulee liner and
it's very pigmented i swatched it on my
hand you see it now yeah alright so I'm
going to go ahead and work that on to my
top lash line so I'm basically want
enough liner on my lid so that it hides
the false lash band and I'm even going
to go in on the top of the waterline up
here
alright so now I'm just gonna put on a
little bit of mascara on my top and
bottom lashes I'm gonna leave that there
because I have made so many mistakes
where I like try to wipe it off as soon
as I put it on even though I've heard
this so many times but wait until it
dries it'll just come off really quick
it won't smear anything so just if you
do something like this leave it there
let it dry and then wipe it off I have
my eyelashes ready and waiting to get on
my eyelid so let's go ahead and put them
on I'm just going to go over the the
lash glue with some above this is this
dark brown shade right here I'm pretty
sure this guy has dried already
I'm going to go ahead and apply some
mascara to my bottom lashes so now that
I'm done with my eyes I'm going to go
into the rest of my face so I'm going to
cover up those under-eye circles and
work that into my under eyes while I'm
at it I'm going to go ahead and use this
as a highlight and just blend it in with
my Beauty Blender and then just a
contour I'm going to use my makeup
forever contour stick I'm just going to
set everything with a powder I'm going
to use my Laura Mercier setting powder
and just set my under eyes so they don't
crease I feel like when I set my under
eyes with translucent powder it does
increase as bad I wouldn't suggest going
crazy with it I have before
it creates lines that weren't even there
before so be very careful with overdoing
the baking underneath your eyes so I'm
just putting a little bit under here so
this is the tarte confidence creamy
powder foundation it's in light/medium
neutral and this has a really nice
coverage the reasons why I like Tarte so
much and I keep using a lot of their
stuff is because their coverage and
their are powders and creams is so so
good so I'm going to use this powder
right here it's really really nice so
I'm gonna use my Too Faced mr.right
perfect powder brush right here see so
cute look at him and before I do that
wipe off this white stuff that I have
all over my face this is just going to
make your contour more intense looking
you see when I wipe it off you can see
that a more intense definition here go
ahead and take this brush right here and
just set everything else and I'm going
to use a light patting motion so that I
get a little bit more coverage okay this
thing just completely fell off I give up
on it just gonna have to go over there
somewhere so bronze up my cheek
somebody's this crown brush 3 tone
bronzer and it's also going to add a
flush of color and it's just really
so I'm just going to go ahead and bronze
up and add a flush of color at the same
time so I'm just going to mix all the
three of those together and then for the
highlight I'm going to use this artist
Couture highlight in Illuminati while
I'm at it I'm just going to pop it on to
the top of my brow bone and pop it on to
that and then okay even though I'm
pretty dewy right now as you can see I
look pretty nice and glowy but I want to
top it off with the tatcha luminous skin
mesh just to look a little bit extra
alright so let's try this colourpop lip
pencil in grunge to fill in the lips I'm
going to go ahead and go in to be a
bombshell this is in the shade secret
it's there pout potion I want to do
something a little bit different so I'm
going to take this Kylie lip metal lip
in air and just see what it looks like
in the center
since I finish look thank you guys for
