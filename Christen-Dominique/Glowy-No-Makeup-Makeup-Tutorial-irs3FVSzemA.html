like a little bit of that for a flush of
color oh my god it's so really I haven't
even had coffee yet hey guys welcome
back to my channel i am bringing you
this very natural no makeup makeup look
it's glowy it's your skin better
it's your brows but better it's your
eyes but better fresh natural walking
face so I think I nailed it because it
doesn't really look like I have makeup
on this makeup look is super easy to do
you can do this look on under five
minutes for sure I definitely amp up the
glow when I'm doing a no makeup look
just because it makes you look so much
more fresh I'm actually on my way to New
York for a New York Fashion Week and I
am headed to the airport I don't want to
look like I just rolled out of bed but
when you see this next clip it's
definitely gonna look like that and it
doesn't look like I have a ton of makeup
on and maybe just a little gloss in
mascara but it looks very fresh very
pretty and clean if you guys want to see
how to look fresh glowy and pretty with
no makeup on then go ahead and keep
watching but before we get started don't
forget to subscribe to my channel and
hit that notification balls to give you
a part of the quoi family and without
further ado let's get on with the big
thing that I'm gonna do is hydrate my
face that's super super important so I'm
just gonna use this moisturizer from
gula sheer transforming perfecting
moisturizer it's very very lightweight
it's perfect for daytime before I get
started especially for like a no makeup
look I love using this is the banana
bright eye cream from LA it has like a
it's like a banana shade so it's going
to help brighten up the darkness under
the eye and I either put this on with
makeup or without makeup it still is a
nice brightener in that way so I'll use
it no matter if I'm wearing makeup or
not anything else that you put on top is
just gonna make it look brighter Elite
effortless to brighten it up down my
nose and on my chin and then just to add
some luminosity to my skin I'm going to
use the True Match Lumi glow shine
this is in the shade light light glow
902 and this is more for like an
all-over kind of glow so I'm just gonna
put put a little bit on and just put it
all over all over the face to get it all
over glowy look but morning Jaden you
brush your teeth I do my brows while
that sits into my skin I'm gonna use
this to your brow pencil I like using
these pencils whenever I'm like doing
something very easy or on the go or
something like that because it's just
easier to do the entire brow and one
stuff so I'm just gonna sketch my brows
in
I feel like this is gonna be the easiest
makeup tutorial ever because it's really
minimal minimal makeup but if you want
that natural kind of I'm wearing no
makeup but I still look really good kind
of look it really requires very few
products so I'm gonna take the radiant
creamy concealer in medium one custard
and just focus that on the inner part of
the eye I'm not gonna bring it out all
the way just because you are gonna be
able to tell that you have some kind of
concealer if it's brightened all the way
to the end of your eye I'm just gonna
bring it in right to this little area
where it's really dark in places that
you have like redness and stuff like
that I'm gonna do that to save some
spots
is huge is it right here I don't even
know how that happened it's pretty dark
for everyone around this area so I'm
just going to get right there in the
nose also using a Beauty Blender really
helps it look very soft and just
effortless looking so I'm going to use
my damp Beauty Blender just to work in
the concealer and on the spots where you
have a lot of redness or big zits you
just use a very soft hand and since I
already have like natural shadows and
shading on my eyelids I kind of just
keep it there because it does kind of
look like ass since I have a shadow on
so it kind of works for me and then I'm
going to take the L'Oreal Lumi glow of
more drops and this is for more of like
a targeted highlight so I'm going to
take these are that this is the shade
daybreak and I'm going to use that on
the high points of my cheeks and a
little goes a long way so I'm just going
to keep it right in here and instead of
contouring I'm just gonna do a little
bit of highlighting right here so just
down the bridge of the nose and a tiny
bit across so that your eyes just focus
on the highlighted spots of your nose
you really don't need to contour if you
don't want to on those no makeup kind of
days and then I'm going to take this
mascara right here from LC and just do a
very light coat
I'm gonna let my lashes dry and then I'm
gonna curl them up so I'm gonna go on to
my blush I'm gonna use this Stila cream
blush it's a very cream blush is super
natural so I'm just gonna take a little
bit of that for a flush of color oh my
god that's a lot and just work that into
my skin I'm actually on my way to the
airport right now and this is perfect
because I don't want to wear ton of
makeup but then again I don't want to
look crazy like I just rolled out of bed
so it just makes you look fresh and
awake and just naturally pretty and then
for the lips I'm using L'Oreal color
riche shine and this is in the shade
glossy fun I love this on my lips it
feels so so nice and comfortable it goes
on like a bomb but it has such a high
shine that it looks like a gloss perfect
for those no makeup days and it's very
hydrating so that is it it's very
natural super easy you can do this in
under five minutes and now I'm just
gonna go do my hair cuz it's looking
kind of crazy a tip for you guys if you
want to get out the door quick and you
don't want your hair to look like a mess
and it's not long enough go back in my
head it's not long enough to put in a
cute ponytail just straighten your hair
it's the easiest thing it's quick so I'm
gonna go straight my hair and then I'll
be back I'm back with my hair
straightened so easy and so quick I'm
gonna just curl my lashes really quick
in a Warby we will be done with this
makeup look so easy thanks for visiting
