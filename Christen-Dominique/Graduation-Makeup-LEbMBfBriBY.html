hey guys here's an easy simple yet
elegant graduation makeup look that
anyone can do let's begin so first you
want to moisten your lips so that
they're nice and soft then you want to
prime your eyes don't worry if you don't
have an eye primer a long wearing
concealer we work just as well now it's
time for a really simple eye shadow
you're going to take the lightest color
you have and apply it to your lid and
brow bone and then just soften the edges
now let's add some dimension to our eyes
go ahead and wash on a taupe color to
your entire crease this is important
with a different clean brush fade this
color out into the other colors let's
draw some more attention to our eyes by
deepening the crease take the same taupe
color in a pencil brush go ahead and
pack that color onto the outer crease
and then blend it away you want it to
look really nice and soft next I'm
taking expresso and wedge from Mac and
applying it to the lower lash line this
is going to give us some added depth to
our eyes I hope this is a simple look
for you guys I know it's a lot of steps
but to need simple I don't know what do
you think I am then taking my favorite
eyeliner from prestige and winging it
out just a bit now this is very optional
I know some you guys are going to say
now this is kind of too much for
graduation look but it's up to you it's
optional it's a glitter gold glitter
eyeliner which I think goes perfectly
well then I applied some mascara and put
on some falsies and now I'm ready to
shape my brows I already kind of shaped
them but I did see they need some fixing
so I went in and just shake them up a
little bit and these are our eyes I hope
you liked it now we're going to contour
I just use this chocolate Salil and
contoured at my cheeks and my temples a
contour is not complete with our
highlight so I went in with piano tooth
and dubois now I'm taking my HD make up
forever powder and locking everything
into place with my hush from my sand
makeup blush I am blushing my cheeks and
putting on some black eyeliner to my
lower water line water rim waterline and
there we go I am now going to clone my
lashes and
put on some mafia lip color all over my
lips so that my lipstick will stay this
is minimalistic sunlight the makeup and
I'm putting it all over and then dabbing
the center wear the pink lipgloss I hope
you enjoyed this video and hello to all
my new subscribers I'm so excited to
have you here with me and I hope to see
everyone who's going to generation
Beauty I'll be there May 31st through
June 2nd it's at LA live so don't be
afraid to say hi I can't wait to give
you a big ol hug but for now cyber hugs
will do anyways till the next video bye
