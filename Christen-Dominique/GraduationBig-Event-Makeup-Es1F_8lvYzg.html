party mama mama
yo paso de todo today I'm going to show
you how to get this graduation /
after-party makeup look let's begin to
completely cover my under-eye circles
and using the Anastasia concealer in
shade 1.5 which is great for light tyree
on skin tones with a yellow undertone so
this is perfect for my under eye circles
and it's complete full coverage so your
circles are going to be gone and then
for the blemishes I'll use the 2.0 shade
it's the light to medium skin tone for
the darker areas and I just put that
over my blemishes now for my brows I'm
taking the honest Asya perfect brow
pencil in the color soft brown and I'm
going to fill in my brows a little
thicker than usual because I want to
create a more youthful look so I'm going
for fuller brows and then once I fill
them in I just flip the pencil over and
use the spoolie to comb them out so I
want to darken up my brows a bit so what
I'm going to do is take the brunette
powder and this is another honest Asya
product so I'm just going to take that
brow powder and fill in those lighter
areas that I want to darken up and this
is my current favorite brow routine as
of now until something else that's even
more amazing comes out but I'll keep you
updated on that thumbs up if you're
loving the honest as your products
because I am definitely loving them for
my lid color and taking the color orange
soda from the lavish palette and packing
that onto my lids
to add depth to the eyes and taking the
color Sienna which is a really pretty
brownish orange color and just washing
that into the crease next in taking the
color cream which is a pale peach matte
color and just using that under the
brows for a nice brow bone highlight
you
now I'm taking the Urban Decay electric
palette using the color urban which is
this really pretty vibrant purple color
and just applying that into the crease I
do see a lot of very simple elegant
books for graduation makeup tutorials
lately so I even did one last year it
was a very simple cream and taupe with a
bit of gold glitter on the lash line but
this year I wanted to punch it up a
little bit and make this wearable for
even after graduation party so don't be
afraid of color place that onto the
crease and then with a clean fluffy
brush blend it upwards
going back into the lavish palette and
taking the color black diamond and
placing this on the outer trees and then
once I have it where I want it I'm
taking a clean brush and just blending
it upwards still leaving a bit of a
harsh line towards the end of the outer
crease but you want to soften the rest
of
to balance out the look I'm gonna take
the color urban once again and apply
that under the lash line with a smaller
brush I'm going to go over the edges of
that purple color to smoke it out of it
to make our eyes look bigger and
brighter and taking the color cream from
the lavish palette and placing that on
the inner corners now I'm just going to
prep my lashes for mascara and I'm just
going to curl them and I like to do this
before my eyeliner usually if I remember
because if you put your eyeliner on
afterwards sometimes it takes it off and
it's a big mess so now I'm going to take
my prestige eyeliner and weed out my
luck my top lash line
to give my eyes a soft frightening look
and using a nude matte highlighting
pencil and applying that on my waterline
and for those of you with red irritated
eyes this works perfect to cancel out
any redness and pictures taking my la
girls black gel pencil I'm going to
redefine my lower lash line next I'm
taking my lorac Pro mascara to add a
length and volume to my lashes
to add extra length and a easy flirty
curl to eyelashes and taking the Ardell
edgy lashes what I did is just cut them
in half and then place them on the
corner so they're super easy to use and
they look amazing and natural for the
lips and using my NYX butter lipstick in
the colour hubba bubba to give our lips
and nude glossy touch and taking the
Urban Decay Naked lip gloss to define my
features and taking my matte bronzer for
my lorac Pro to go palette and just
chiseling out my cheekbones alongside
the nose and the under the lip to make
it look a bit more pouty and under the
chin in case you know you have any type
of double chin going on to give our
cheeks of Rosie touch and taking the
Sigma born to blush blusher and applying
that to the apples of my cheeks and just
sweeping that back into the hairline and
this is the final look I hope you
enjoyed the video and congratulations to
all the 2014 graduates until the next
video bye dollies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
