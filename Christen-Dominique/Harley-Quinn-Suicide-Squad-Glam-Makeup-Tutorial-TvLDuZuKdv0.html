like that intro it's pretty cool let's
go ahead and get into the face I'm gonna
prime my face with the Kat Von D lock-it
primer I have this glove on and I just
realize it's not going to I was trying
to give you guys a full of Safie to go
ahead and apply the primer so that the
foundation lace keep in so for the
foundation I'm going to be using the
Lancome 24 hour makeup I'd never used
this one before it supposed to be super
full coverage and use my it cosmetics
foundation and concealer brush start to
look it into my face I wanted to go for
just a lighter foundation rather than
the white paint because I want to make
it a little bit more realistic for a
concealer I'm gonna use the Urban Decay
Naked skin concealer just use the
lightest concealer you have and I'm just
gonna consume
so I'm going to take my ash brown and
I'm gonna use my luck C 215 brush and
just fill in my brows
all right so we're gonna move on to the
eye shadow I'm gonna leave the face for
a little bit later case you have any
fallout or messed up so you can always
fix it with concealer take this face
powder from Urban Decay essence in fair
cool and I'm just going to lay down a
nice even base for my shadow to smoothly
blend on this big fluffy brush what is
this the morphe M a 5 to 4 place it on
the lid bring it all the way up to the
brow bone I don't use primers much on my
eyes but I feel like using your
concealer in your powder as soon as good
as a primer it helps everything go on
smooth lasts long and look a lot more
vibrant if you guys see me looking off
to the side it's because there's a huge
monitor where I can see my face I'm just
trying to see what I'm doing okay so now
we're gonna get into the crease I'm just
gonna use a neutral taupe shade I'm
gonna take this Tarte palette it's like
a little book I just want to decorate
with it I'm gonna take nudes the shade
right here and I'm gonna work that into
the crease we're going to use windshield
wiper motions and I'm not putting down
that much pressure because I want to
build up the the shade I'm using the
lightest pressure on my brush so I'm
going to start with the right side the
right side is gonna be red that's how I
remember it
right red and I'm gonna take this erotic
I'm gonna take this erotic shade that's
the name of it from colour-pop and I'm
gonna lay this down as a base has a
little bit of an orange sheen to it but
we're gonna put a matte shade over it
I'm gonna go ahead and take this Coastal
Scents palette I'm taking this red shade
right here with this brush this is a 239
for Mac just any flat shader brush that
you have okay so I'm also picking up
this darker shade of red right here so
going between those two and I got a
pretty good amount of eyeshadow on my
lid and I don't want to put any more on
it I'm gonna take whatever I have on my
lid and just start to work it upwards
towards the brow bone like right in the
crease using
hand okay I'm gonna start to work it I
know the down onto the top of my
cheekbone because she does kind of have
it really messy this is actually a
little bit of a cleaner version I wanted
to do something that I would actually
want to wear and still look cute I'm
just going to work my brush in there and
kind of just drag it down onto my cheek
bone and then I'm blending it onto the
lower part of the outer lash line okay
so now I'm going to take this blue color
right here this is too shy and pop it on
to Liz and if you're not that great eye
doing your makeup or you're not really
into makeup this is the perfect look for
Halloween because you can be a little
messy there's no real like perfect way
of doing it it's supposed to be messy so
mess it up if you want but also you can
glam it up too when I saw the Suicide
Squad is like I have to do that for
Halloween okay so now I'm going to go
back into the Coastal Scents palette so
I'm gonna take my zoeva flat shader
brush and I'm going to start here see
what that looks like and then we'll
probably pop into this too
yeah we're definitely to use the darker
shade of blue
I'm going to add some dimension to my
eye so I'm going to take this black
shade right here this is the silhouette
and I'm gonna focus this on the crease
I'm gonna try out the Kylee gel liner
this is in black and I'm going to use
these Oh Eva Green liner brush we're
gonna create a glam wing
I'm going to highlight the inner corner
of my eyes with this shoe a highlight
and citrine and I'm using my dose of
color is pencil brush loaded up
I'm going to add some mascara this is
the makeup forever excessive lash
mascara and it is one of my favorite
mascaras because the way that brush is
it just grabs every little hair all
right so I'm going to apply some lashes
the lashes I'm using are not in this box
the lashes that I've using are from Lily
lashes these are the goddess ones
um neighs the kylie liner just to tight
line the upper lash line so you don't
see any skin picking oh my god that
tickles
so bad like it's really hard for me to
get to even get makeup in that area cuz
that's just like very irritating but it
looks good though beauty is pain
I'm also gonna line the lower waterline
okay so now I'm going to set my entire
face means that urban decay powder this
is actually my go-to powder it's full
coverage just makes you look super
flawless so I'm gonna take my big powder
brush this is from Murphy it's the e-40
one now I'm going to add some highlight
I'm going to take the citrine from ziwei
I'm going to use my new Sigma brush and
then I'm gonna pop this on to the top of
the cheekbone
we're the blush I'm going to go with
something very light and roundish so I'm
going to take this one right here this
is from Tarte it's the shade flush and
I'm going to take my stippling brush
from NYX load it up and pop it on and
then for the lips I'm going to use the
Kylie lip pencil and Mary Jo Mary Jo K
for the rest of the lips I'm going to
take the Anastasia American doll liquid
lipstick and just pop it right on top
okay so now I'm gonna go ahead and do
the tattoos on the face I've seen plenty
of people draw it on like an eyeliner
but if you're like me I'm not that great
at drawing so instead an alternative is
to get a tattoo I got this there's this
rotten one right here you can get them
on Etsy Hot Topic amazon.com and things
like that and I'm just going to use
these little guys on my face part is on
the red side I'm going to take the heart
here I'm gonna take a little q-tip and
dip it in some water so you don't mess
up the makeup too much and wish me luck
oh I almost messed it up Thank You mochi
described now I'm going to go ahead and
put on the rotten tattoo they're like
right where my contour with these
I have some other tattoos on my chest
right here and on my on for the final
touches I'm going to do the red ribbon
on the red side the red side and the
blue red ribbon on the blue side and
then I'm just going to tie it in the
back okay so what you can do is grab a
friend whoever's around your mom your
sister or your friend I am having my
friend here
just tie it for me and bobby pin the
loose strands if it is a little tricky
yeah so now we're doing a blue one just
going to tie it around oh he'll tie it
and then we're Bobby pinning the little
loose ends by the way you guys this is
