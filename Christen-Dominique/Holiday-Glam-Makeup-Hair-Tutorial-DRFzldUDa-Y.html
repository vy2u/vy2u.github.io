giving you all the Christmas vibes this
is gonna be a very festive holiday
makeup look and the good thing about
this makeup look no matter what shade or
skin tone you are you're we're gonna
look beautiful in this look because it
is universally pretty on everyone also
as you can see I have a really long hair
today really really long I put a pull-up
on Twitter and I asked you guys if you
want to see a long or short hair
tutorial a lot of you guys said long
hair so I put in these extensions and
I'm showing you how I get this holiday
hair right here it's a big thank you to
new me for partnering up with me in this
hair tutorial because I'm going to be
using their classic one such a big
barrel it creates the most beautiful
waves and curls in your hair maybe
showing you how to get this holiday hair
and makeup so if you want to see how to
get it then don't forget to subscribe to
my channel and hit that notification
bell so you can be a part of the quad
family and without further ado let's get
on with the video put some primers
because I have dry spots red spots so I
have this green one for red spots and
I've never used her I'm actually opening
it right now and it's green it looks
like this I'm gonna just put this on my
cheeks because you can see you have a
lot of redness going on right there so
it's gonna help counteract that red
right and they're just trying to be in
the holiday spirit with this red and
green I have a hydrating primer just
blue and I'm gonna pick that on the
perimeters of my face now that I'm done
with the 50 primers 50 shades of primers
I'm gonna do my brows I don't think I'd
do them on camera very often so I'm
gonna be using the precise of my brow
pencil in number 5 I'm just gonna fill
in right underneath the bottom I also
like to add more to my brow cuz they're
really thin I'll go a little bit lower
than what they are and I'll connect it
to the end right here that looks kind of
crazy right now and I always end up not
doing my brows on camera because of this
long process but I'm gonna do them on
camera
are you guys today and I actually curved
this
purposely then it's easier to use that
way for me so it didn't come in like
this and then I just brushed through as
I go the powder makes your brows look
just naturally Bowl it's a very soft
kind of powder then with the foolproof
brow powder using the shade number five
I'll take these two shades and mix them
together and I'll work it on the back
part of the brow front of the brow so
wipe off my brush and I'll use the front
of this cute little brow and I'll work
that into the front so what I'll do is
I'll hold it straight like this and do
these little slits so the thinnest part
of the brush is the very tail end that's
why I keep that one up and I have a new
foundation that I want to try I'm really
excited to try it I've heard really good
things about it it's the Maybelline 24
hour foundation supposed to be a full
coverage foundation this is in the shade
I hope it's my shade sunbathe and I'm
also using this sponge if you follow me
on snapping to stories you know that I
post a picture of this little guy right
here and it's so cool-looking it's just
it's like a bell honestly feels like a
piece of furniture it's just like
microfiber or something it's really cool
feels like velvet and so I wanted to see
how it would perform with foundation on
my face and here we go putting on
foundation with microfiber basically so
whoa whoa whoa that's a lot that is a
lot and I think it's because the little
hairs are so close together it grabs a
lot more product so once oh this is
actually a lot darker than my face but
it kind of matches my skin tone because
my face is lighter than the rest of my
body because I exfoliate it and I think
I'm gonna be good with just one layer of
this foundation I'm gonna add some
concealer now I'm gonna do the shape
tape I always do my concealer a little
bit differently every time so today
we're making it a tornado
I really missed the point from the
Beauty Blender or the LC sponge I'd
rather have it pointy but you know it's
okay
this foundation dries really really fast
for the eyes today I'm going to be using
the new
nars narcissist wanted palette it looks
like this inside it's a very very pretty
palette and I'm very excited to use this
guy right here it is the most beautiful
color I'm gonna use this shade right
here I don't know the names that are
like always backwards so I hate when
they have them on the back of the
palette it just confuses me so I just
rather not even say it but I'm gonna use
this light taupe shade right here for
the crease I'm just gonna start right
right in here right on the outer part of
the lid and going in softly in
windshield wiper motions just back and
forth and then circular motion swigs the
end instead of just having it on the
crease I'm gonna bring it down to the
bottom of the lid this whole entire
outer section right here and just
slightly with a very light hand like
pressure circular motions just working
the shade in there okay I'm just doing a
wash of that color and then I'm gonna
take the next darkest matte shade which
is this one right here I'm gonna do the
same thing just work it in the outer
portion of the eye right below the
lighter shade that we just use so right
below you want it to peek through there
and just go back and forth
the next circuits color and pick up is
this one right here it's like a dark
brown almost black I'm gonna take that
on a smaller brush some more heat in 507
and I'm just gonna work that on the
outer levy
I'm gonna angle it upwards towards the
end of the brow just so it gives your
eye more of a lifted look and then I'm
going back in with a light transition
shade that I used earlier in the same
brush and I'm just going on the edges
along the edges at the darkest shade so
we can soften them out when I blend this
out it almost looks like a grayish black
it doesn't look so much brown to me so
I'm gonna take this pencil brush right
here and a maybe it'll look a little bit
more true to color with this I'm gonna
take it right around on the tested out
right here first
Stokes kind of black it's like a ashy
dark brown there's one in here it's
called hot cider it's in the nice
palette from Kylie this one right here
take a Bobbi Brown oh yeah this is more
of what I'm looking for so I'll use that
where the edges bring it into the crease
I'm going to take the lightest shade
right here I'm going to pop that on the
lid now for the star of the show I'm
going to be using this shade right here
again this is what it looks like very
pretty
I'm gonna pop that on the inner corners
all the way down to the lower lash line
and so it shows up to its maximum
potential I spread some fix+
on my brush
and then I'm gonna hit a little bit more
of this darker shade right on the outer
part for the lashes I'm gonna go with
these iris Beauty lashes right here in
Cleopatra's is what they look like and I
take them out of the box
for the highlight I'm gonna use this
zoeva strobe gel this is in the shade
rewind rewind gel nova the sort of says
rewind gel nova it's a really pretty
kind of champagne rose gold and it feels
like putty I'm just like digging my
finger in there I'm gonna skip the
bronzing today I'm just gonna go
straight into contouring I'm gonna be
using the hardest pro glow contour
powders and highlights
and then with a Kat Von D yellow shade
to look more buttony shape literally
just creating a totally different nose
on my face and then with some Laura
Mercier setting powder I'm gonna go in
way through this guy and big right
underneath my eye and I do it right on
the corner of the mouth because we're
tricking the eye to make it look like
it's more lifted that's it for a little
bit and while that's baking I'm gonna do
blush instead of bronzer with this look
for the blushes I'm going to use these
two tart ones I'm going to mix them
together
this one is Dollface and this reddish
one here is natural beauty I'm gonna mix
the two together
and it's going to give me a really nice
pretty flush of color I'm gonna pick up
fire and it'll it for the rest of the
powder we're just gonna knock it off for
the lips I'm gonna take max brick to
line them up and then I'm gonna go oh my
crazy and then I want to go over with
the colour-pop ultra matte lip in ribbon
so I'm done with my makeup now I'm gonna
move on to my hair I have a ton of
extensions in my head I'm gonna take
this guy out I'm gonna show you how I
curl my hair for the holiday so my hair
is pretty crazy looking right now I
actually washed all my extensions and
put them in so that's why they look kind
of crazy like that
and a little frizzy my hair naturally is
frizzy too so I'm gonna go ahead and
show you how I curl my hair for the
holidays when I'm wearing extensions I'm
gonna be using the 32 a millimeter
classic wand from nume I'm gonna brush
my crazy hair out and I'm just gonna do
section at a time and I'm gonna curl the
bottom pieces even though my hair is
super frizzy the one is gonna help
smooth out all the frizziness you just
click it right there to turn it on it's
super easy to use and you don't even
have to hold your hair in the one got
long for it to curl and the good thing
about this is that your curls
last for like days if you don't wash
your hair you're gonna have a really
nice curls the next day and the next day
all you need is dry shampoo and I like
to have spacing in between the curls and
leave a little bit out so that you don't
have a tight curl all the way to the end
of the hair now I'm gonna make another
section I'm just gonna go around and
curl the rest of my hair but anything
around my face is gonna go back
this is the last section gonna let it
down put the rest of the hair that I
already did back I think it's really
cool that new he's gonna be a Knowlton
now that's so crazy you can get their
straighteners their their curling wands
their sets all the things at Ulta
I'm gonna take a little portion of it
over and then just ease back combing
this area so we have a little bit of
height see how it doesn't just go flat
in that is my holiday hair thank you
