welcome back to my channel today I'm
going to be doing this holiday look for
you guys
makeup and outfits so if you want to
learn how to get it and keep watching
excuse the foundation on my nails but
I'm using the Becca ultimate coverage
complexion cream and it's my first time
using it I think it's really good it
does what it says it covers up
everything but it feels super thick on
your skin so I wouldn't wear this all
the time only if I was like going to a
big event or a big party so now that my
face is nice and even I'm going to go
ahead and do a little bit of color
correcting on my eyes I'm going to do
something a little bit different you can
see all my under eye circles today I'm
going to color correct so I'm going to
use this reddish orange shade right here
and apply it to the areas where it's the
darkest under my eyes and then I'm going
to go right on top of that with a more
natural looking concealer that's closest
to my natural skin tone and this is
supposed to completely banish the
darkness if you go on the color wheel
red orange and yellow hues or right
across from blue purple and green and
this is supposed to completely cancel
the color so if you have raccoon eyes
this is gonna help
I have raccoon eyes so that's what I'm
doing today I'm going to take this
vanilla shade right here it's a matte
shadow from Smashbox and I'm just going
to apply it all over the lid so I'm just
working that in there I'm going from the
lid all the way up to the top of the
brow bone with a big fluffy brush for
the crease I'm going to take Turkish
bath which is this shade right here it's
matte and we'll work it into the crease
using a more dense pointer brush because
I want it to be focused in just this
area but I'm going to go ahead and take
these two taupe shades right here this
is from the Smashbox palette and I'm
going to take a fluffier wider brush to
blend that into the crease but it's also
okay if it goes a little bit above that
so that's why I'm using a bigger brush
and then I'm going to use this orange e
brown shade right here and I'm going to
focus this with my on the outer part of
my crease I'm using a flat shader brush
and I'm just using that right on the
outer part flicking it upwards and then
taking a clean blending brush a fluffy
brush and just blending the top of the
shadow and here I'm just going back in
doing the same
kind of laying it down on the area I
want flicking it up and then blending
the very top this is just to intensify
that area you can do less or more and
customize it however you want so I
decided to bring the crease color
further inward so that my eyes look more
deep set and that's why I am bringing it
inwards and then blending out the top of
the shadow and now I'm going to elongate
my crease and add more definition as if
there wasn't enough already I'm taking
this reddish brown shade right here and
going to elongate my crease so I'm going
to take it out a little further than
what it naturally is and then I'm going
to blend upwards with a fluffy brush
just to make sure that everything is
nice and soft at the top of the crease
and then I'm taking a cream matte shadow
and I'm going to highlight the brow bone
when I highlight the brow bone I like to
work it downwards into the crease and
then blend it so it looks really nice
and soft and it just makes the
transition look beautiful
stronger firm but now I'm taking a black
shadow right here and I'm going to
create a wing with the shadow and this
is honestly my first time doing this
smoked out wing but I'm doing the wing
and then I'm blending out the very end
of it and I think it came out pretty
good considering this is my first time
um so after I did the wing I blended it
out with the blending brush and then I
went in with my Makeup Forever aqua
liner and did a nice clean wing it gets
a little messy with the shadow
especially with the shadow so I got some
concealer and I cleaned it up sharpened
out that wing in a cognitive kind of
card room
it kind of elongated the wing so it made
it look extra sharp
yeah so I'm gonna take this matte black
shade right here from the Urban Decay
Gwen Stefani palette and I'm going to
focus that on the end of the wing and
then I'm going to just blend it up I
just needed a little bit more intensity
in that area
so now I'm going to take this Smashbox
liner I'm going to line my waterline
it's ok if it bleeds over to the lash
line because we're gonna smoke it and
smudge it out anyways I'm also going to
take this beautiful palette which I
showed earlier but it's so beautiful I
had to actually show the cover I'm
taking this brown shade right here I'm
gonna place it on the bottom lash line
and just work it back and forth into the
lash line smoke it out and then I'm
taking this angled liner brush because I
wanted to in really intensify some of
the areas with a black shadow here I'm
just applying some mascara this is the
tarte gifted mascara just so that it can
mesh really well with our lashes and the
lashes I'm just popping them onto the
center attaching one side at a time and
just so that it doesn't look lopsided
and everything looks centered now it's
time before the face back to the face
I'm going to go ahead and lock my
foundation into place with the Urban
Decay powder and this gives me really
good coverage makes my skin look really
smooth and then I am going under my eyes
with a highlighting powder a matte
highlighting powder from the kat von d
palette it's this one right here the two
that are like totally hitting pan um
those are my go-to under eyeshadows or
under eye powders and I'm just
contouring the cheeks then the sides of
the nose just so that it looks more
straight and not so full at the end I
like it to look a little bit Center and
now it's time for the blush for my blush
I'm going to use bliss this is a makeup
geek blush it's matte its rosy as pairs
really nicely with the eyeshadow so now
I'm going to move on to the lips and I'm
going to line my lips first with the la
girl lip liner in Barrie's and then I'm
going to use the colour-pop lippie stick
I mean the colour-pop ultra matte lip in
silhouette it's a beautiful read I can't
even tell you how beautiful this red is
it is really beautiful and the but the
only thing about this this one
particular for some reason I feel like
it smudges a little bit more than the
other ultra matte lip ease I don't know
why maybe it's just me but the color is
beautiful I love how this look came out
it's a smoky wing so it's not
overbearing with the black shadow in the
red
