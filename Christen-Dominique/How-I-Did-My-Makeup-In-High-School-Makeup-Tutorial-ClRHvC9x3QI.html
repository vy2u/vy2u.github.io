welcome back to my channel so today I am
taking you back in time I look Oh very
different I was about to say a whole
lotta in very at the same time I kicking
you back in time when I used to look
like this with black hair of course she
had a wig so I can give you the full
effect this is how I did my makeup in
high school you see it um I have
pictures for you guys you could see I
didn't have a ton of friends but I
always had one friend I was always super
shy and just very introverted I wasn't
like a very popular person I was very
much into my makeup I was on the dance
team and dance was like a big deal to me
so that was me in a nutshell in high
school let's get into it
I did not put primer on and if not who
moisturizer on use this stuff and this
was literally my face this is my face
the Revlon Colorstay was my holy grail
ride-or-die in high school I loved it so
much I wouldn't go anywhere outside of
the house without this stuff especially
around my friends or school anything
like that it actually this necklace
right here I would wear this nobody else
wore it I don't know why I wore it
if I didn't have like a black ribbon to
tie around my neck I would find cloth
and cut it and then tie it around my
neck isn't popular or something cool to
do for some reason I just really liked
it was weird by the way you guys these
lips are so good why I'm eating it right
now just moment I have no idea it makes
no sense I think I would use my finger
to put on the foundation rub it in like
this it even smells like high school
like it smells like me getting ready in
the morning I would wake up at 6 o'clock
in the morning to do my makeup I really
have to be at school by 8:00 and I'd
always have contacts on the funny thing
about it is the contacts were not even
mine they were my friends
they were prescription so I couldn't see
anything I was basically blind walking
around school and
I remember this foundation back then
would dry so fast you would have to work
really fast with it I would put my
foundation from all the way from up here
down to my shoulders I was freaking
crazy this has really good coverage so I
see what my younger self was like I have
to have this every single day on my face
I'm gonna let that dry and the concealer
I used was from a Revlon it was the
photo-ready concealer I figured if the
foundation was super intense than this
must be intense too and it honestly was
okay wasn't like amazing but it was
alright so I would use different
concealers but this is one that I did
use cheese a lot and I'd do it like this
I would always do it like in a circle I
would bring it out to my temples but I'd
mainly focus it like right where the
little circle was I want to highlight so
bad but I didn't do that back in the
days this was my face so far just tons
of foundation concealer and now we're
going to pile on the powder this is the
L'Oreal mineral True Match but using
this brush I don't know you know one
thing rarely changed this entire time
from high school to now the amount of
coverage that I like is pretty much the
same I didn't do a bad job at coverage
back in the days I would recommend
somebody to use this makeup is they
wanted full coverage I probably didn't
need as much coverage as I thought back
then but if you are looking for full
coverage makeup or if you're trying to
cover like a scar or a beard or whatever
and you're looking for drugstore makeup
this is actually not bad of a choice I
actually always did my friends makeup in
school and I'd always get in trouble for
doing other people's makeup this started
like in middle school when I couldn't
even wear makeup I would always sneak it
though that was a good kid that's my
face in this picture that I'm looking at
and I do remember making sure to make
this area super bright to the point
where it's not even blended out it's
just so bright I didn't buy anything
from I don't remember what I used to
make my under eyes so bright I'm sure I
just use a lighter powder I just don't
remember which one so I'm just going to
use this one right here this is from
Tarte of course I didn't use
at that time but this is like the
lightest color I can find so I'm just
gonna take it on a brush and just start
to really pack it underneath my eyes
like I used to I don't think I focused
too much I'm going straight down and
then up I would just go in a big circle
and I'd always bring it out pretty far I
didn't realize what it was called I just
knew that it made my eyes look brighter
whatever it was doing to my face I liked
it so I just kept doing it and I'd bring
it out all the way I just didn't know
what it was called back then that crazy
but it's so funny I would wear contacts
all the time and they weren't mine so I
couldn't see out of them very well but I
remember I had really bad so like social
anxiety and just anxiety about
everything just always scared about
everything around me so when I would
walk around school the contacts that I
couldn't see out of that I thought made
me look cute they would help me walk
through the hallways like comfortably
because if I didn't have him on I
remember being really uncomfortable and
just wanting to go straight to my
classroom and just didn't want to talk
to anybody I was scared so when I had
contacts on I was like oh whatever
I can't see who's looking at me I'm just
gonna walk through the halls even though
that sounds so dumb I actually it helped
me with my social anxiety let's go to
the browse it doesn't look like I did
much to the browse but I definitely
filled them in I remember by this red
pencil from Maybelline and I didn't
really do much my brows just darken them
up and keep the same weird shape it
wasn't even that and they weren't big
they were small yeah that looks a little
bit better than I used to do my brows
like this which is basically the same
shape as my brow but just a little bit
darker and it wasn't big at all I used
to do the sinister brows so I'm just
gonna keep the same kind of shape do you
see those white under eyes that is so
white I'm gonna leave my brows like this
because this is I didn't really do much
to them I don't even think I brushed
them out I'm just gonna leave them like
this next I'm gonna go ahead and do my
eyes okay this is really interesting so
when I when I started doing my eye
shadow but I did it because of the dance
team like we had a certain like palette
from Mary Kay that we used and it had
red gold blue and just like these ugly
colors in there we'd use them all the
time
I was like oh this is cute I think I'm
going to use it every day so I would use
the same colors every day of course I
couldn't find that mary kay palette but
i did try to find colors that are very
close to what i used it was basically a
goal just like this and a reddish pink
the color of this so these two colors
together every single day was my eye
shadow look in high school just living
my little golden pink life so I would
take this gold I'm using this one from
Maybelline it's kind of shimmery on my
inner corner if I wasn't using gold I
was using soft pink in a peach I'd used
those two together but I'd always had
two different colors I never had one oh
my god this is bringing back so many
memories and I just started putting it
on my eyelid now I'm going to take this
paint on the outer corners I'm just
gonna take the other side and I didn't
use these I actually use these
applicators right here and honestly
they're not that bad so I'm gonna take
this pink right here and put it on the
outer corner
oh my there's no transition color two
colors hanging out together on my
eyeball and I didn't put any eyeshadow
on my bottom lash line which is so
uncomfortable for me so I'm just gonna
move on to my eyeliner I didn't do wings
in high school I didn't even realize
that wings were think so I used to use
this L'Oreal black mica leaner intense
eyeliner this is gonna be so weird do
not make a wing do not make a wing so
there we go
um and then I would put on the blackest
blackest eyeliner if I didn't have I'm
going to show you this if I didn't have
this eyeliner right here this is the
L'Oreal carbon black extra intense
liquid pencil liner if I didn't have
this liner I would use this one to line
my waterline I was torturing myself but
it's so funny cuz everybody liked the
way did my makeup and everybody always
wanted me to do their makeup in high
school so I felt really confident about
my makeup who would have known that
everybody's compliments whether they
were right or wrong would have led me to
wear what I'm doing today which is
making YouTube makeup tutorials for a
living so thank you guys
all the ones who supported me I was like
I have to be make parties because
everybody says I'm great and I know I'm
good
everybody always wants me to do their
makeup makeup is just my life and what I
breathe sleep dream thanks so I would go
to like the like one if we went to
Walmart CVS Target or anything like that
I would stay in the makeup aisle for so
long and honestly I wouldn't even go to
Target that much because target was more
expensive like was more expensive place
to go that's what I would do for mascara
I would use this one from L'Oreal since
the voluminous original in blackest
black at the time I didn't know about
lashes I actually did not know that you
could put fake lashes on your I had no
clue what lashes were so I would just
put on a ton of mascara no put them on
until they were like nice and spidery
and clumpy and then I put on more in
high school I was like concerned about
my grades and stuff but I wasn't it
wasn't something that I always thought
about I wanted to be as masseuse or
psychologist my mom wanted me to be a
nurse because she was a nurse but if I
could be a doctor I mean a nurse or a
doctor do you wanted me to be in like
the medical field I didn't want to I was
like I'll do anything else but that I
don't like I'm bad at math so I'm going
to give people the wrong amount of
medicine L'Oreal had this palette wit of
highlight and bronzer but it was all
super illuminating and i don't think
they dont sell it anymore for sure but
it was this he big like a nice sized
palette like about this size and it was
nothing but highlight and bronzing
strips but they were all super
illuminating and so the closest thing I
could find was this True Match Lumi
which is kind of a warm bronzy
highlighting palette and so I'm gonna
put this where I used to put it on my
face before you're gonna be a little
scared I put it on my cheeks mind you I
had a ton of bumps all over my face so
it didn't make it any better and I put
it all over my forehead here he knows I
just put it all right there just like it
was blush I don't know what I was doing
I thought this kind of bronzed me up a
little bit
remember what exact blush I had but I
just got covergirl because pretty basic
affordable and that's basically what my
makeup was back in the days so I got
this one
I'd start right here and then go all the
way back and I could see it was pretty
low and I'd make sure under-eye area was
so bright I'm gonna go ahead and curl my
lashes because I know I used to love
doing this and I would curl them and
curl them until they would touch the top
right up here oh my god I can't believe
I almost forgot this so I would all
should also take my blush and just run
it right across my eyelid like this and
I'd also put it on my nose what I think
my mom taught me to put the blush on
your nose so I'd have a red face you
guys now that I think about it I used to
use blush as bronzer I was basically
draping back in the day and I didn't
even realize it and then I put it right
above my eyes I just sweep it across
really quick I feel like my eyelashes
were longer I can't get him that long I
don't know what I did so next is my lips
so for my lids it was pretty basic I
reward just a lip gloss like this one or
I put a little bit of color so I'm using
this shade it's from r-mo it's the r-mo
by Kate and this is pretty similar to
what I would wear just anything pink
peachy gloss oh it smells like
watermelon and then I'm going to go
ahead and put on this Revlon lip gloss
is's snow pink from Revlon and it has
these gold flecks in it which is
something that I would have loved back
in the days so I'm just gonna put a lot
of that on and I always wanted bigger
lips so I would put it on a ton I
wouldn't do the lipliner for some reason
but I would put on a ton of the lip
gloss because I felt like it would bring
more attention to my lips so I put on a
lot like if I just finished eating a
whole bunch of fried chicken nobody
taught me how to line your lips yet I
wasn't watching YouTube yet at the time
and so I would put on a ton of lip gloss
100 layers of lip gloss I'm gonna leave
it at that this was basically my makeup
in high school it has evolved so much
since then what do you guys think thank
