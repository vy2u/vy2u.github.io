today I am showing you how to stop your
face from looking super cakey like this
guy over here so what I did for you guys
is I showed you step by step on this
side how to get the most coverage out of
everything that you're using without it
looking textured rough thick and cakey
on this side I showed you all the things
that you're not supposed to do I think
you can tell it's making me really sad
right now just looking at it it's it's
so bad
unless you're far away I would say yes
you look good but close-up it's it's
scary it's a scary sight so I wanted to
show you the don'ts remember that
everything that I do on this side of my
face is something that I've done and
learn from so if you're doing something
that you love then keep doing it let me
know if you do any of the don'ts I want
to know put them in the comments so if
you want to learn how to stop the cake
face from happening on your face then go
ahead and subscribe to my channel and
hit that notification bell so you can be
part of the Quogue family and without
further ado let's get on with the video
before any of us start with our makeup
we want to make sure that we have nice
clean skin what I would advise you guys
to do is go and wash your face sure you
exfoliate exfoliate your skin is going
to remove the dead skin cells from the
very top layer of your skin it's gonna
give you more of a smooth feeling to
your skin after you've exfoliated your
skin it's clean you've removed the oil
the dirt you're ready to moisturize your
face whether you have oily skin or dry
skin personally my skin is a little dry
slash combo no matter what season I'm in
it's a little bit dry always so that's
kind of the skin type I have - what I
like to do is use a thicker heavier
moisturizer during the day and night so
I've actually found this one this is the
use a sorbet cheer in strong protection
I use this for my daytime moisturizer so
I'm gonna put that on the good side of
my face the part that is going to look
flawless and smooth
within poreless so I'm gonna put that
all in my hair just put it all in my
hair just really get in there after
you've applied your moisturizer don't go
straight in with a primer and foundation
you want to wait a little bit till that
sets in your skin kind of dries and then
you can go in because if you go straight
in there it's gonna look uneven because
it's so wet you want to wait till things
dry on your face you don't want to go in
when they're still fresh and wet so give
it a second I'd say about 30 minutes
before you actually start doing your
foundation and your makeup if you can
wait that long if not get a fan get a
little baby fan you are dry we're ready
for our primer or if you're feeling lazy
and you don't want to use a moisturizer
and then a primer you just don't have
time for that you can always get one of
these guys this is from Smashbox it's
the photo finish hydrating primer so
it's gonna give you the best of both the
worlds in one - this is a good one for
us dry girls who have trouble with the
desert happening on our face but if you
have oily skin i would suggest you use a
mattifying primer coverfx has a great
one so does makeup forever they have the
base one mattifying primer the formula
is very thin and lightweight so you
don't feel like you have a thick layer
but the good thing is if you have oily
skin you were gonna look younger longer
so I'm jealous so now that that is set
into my skin I'm gonna go ahead and use
this primer right here this is from Herb
Orion this is the pink perfect cream
this is one of my current favorite
primers because it does help reduce the
appearance of texture a little goes a
long way and also if you have kind of
dull skin this is gonna help brighten
your skin on when I have thicker primers
which is always I always like to Pat
them into my skin because they are going
to get into those pores and fill them
out so it looks like you have a smoother
surface I don't normally do this all the
time but just for the sake of my other
viewers out there that do like to color
correct their face I want to show you
how to do this properly so you don't
have a cake face to be honest the more
layers that you put on your face the
higher chance you're going to have a
cakey looking face I'm going to color
correct around my nose I like to use my
fingers because the natural warmth of
your
and we'll heat up the product and it's
just gonna apply smoother and softer
I'm literally dabbing on the smallest
amount it's gonna help cancel that out I
personally don't like color correcting
under the eyes because my eyes are very
deep set I feel like if I add foundation
concealer powder over the color
corrector that's just another layer of
cake
we are gonna choose a foundation that is
right for our face so I am usually dry
normal dry combo so what I'm gonna use
for my skin type is from L'Oreal this is
the infallible Pro glow and this is for
normal to dry skin Julie a medium
coverage I can kind of build it up to a
full I feel like does have a more
luminous finish so if you are used to
having that dry dull looking skin this
is going to be a really good one for you
if your skin is more on the normal to
oily kind of side I would choose the
matte and poreless foundation this is
from Maybelline I feel like you can get
a really nice full coverage out of this
without it looking crazy I'm gonna apply
my foundation today with a L'Oreal
beauty sponge any Beauty sponge that you
find that you love for me it's Beauty
Blender and this one they are pretty
much the same to me just shape is
different and this one's a lot cheaper
and I'm just gonna dot it on you always
want to start off with a thinnest layer
of foundation let it dry and then see if
you need more I like using a sponge
rather than a brush because it soaks up
the excess product also it pounces
lightly onto your skin so it gives you
the most softest airbrushed look the
brush creates this micro exfoliation on
your skin that really shows all the dead
skin and it brings up the flakiness so I
just applied a light layer I'm gonna let
that sit and apply another layer because
I do like the cake but I don't like to
look like the cake and I like to keep
the foundation away from the under eyes
is the more layers the more cakey look
that you're gonna get on this side of my
face I'm gonna use a foundation that is
not for my skin type and I didn't prime
so you do the math and then I'm going to
use a brush
let's make it worse um not only are we
going in with a brush we are also going
in circular motions which is going to
bring up that flakiness so I'm going to
go under the eyes put a lot of
foundation under there this side still
needs some more this is two layers of
foundation on the side this is one big
block of foundation to be honest and a
lot of concealing under the eyes with
the foundation so the next step we're
gonna do is concealing concealing to me
is I don't know what I'd do without
concealer I'm gonna go in with the
heart-shaped tape in light/medium this
concealer is awesome because it doesn't
crease on your face it doesn't enhance
those fine lines it has a lot of amazing
skincare properties that can only help
your skin this concealer is thick so you
don't need a lot of it so what I'm gonna
do is just put a dot right here for me
this is the darkest area of my eye I'm
gonna go down here I never like to
follow the actual shape of my under-eye
circles because that will give you a
reverse raccoon eye and what this is
going to do is also make your eye look a
little bit more lifted brighter younger
awake everything that you want in life
is going to happen with this concealer
let's erase those under-eye circles so
while that dries I'm gonna go over to
the cake face side with this concealer
like I said it is pretty thick so you
don't need to put too much this is what
too much looks like and at this point
you literally look like you can scrape
it off of your face which I used to love
this look and in person honestly if
you're not looking from far it does not
look pretty it looks very textured you
look older it does not look good so I'm
going to take another little layer here
and it's okay to layer your foundation
it's okay to layer your concealer just
make sure you wait let it dry and then
decide if you need another layer so this
eye is brighter but you can already see
the fine lines here on this eye and
what's going on right here alright so
now it's time to set everything in place
so that it doesn't move or budge
throughout the day so we're gonna set
with a powder anything that you set with
the powder is going to last
and the good side we are going to take a
translucent powder this is a Beauty
Blender I'm just gonna dip it into the
powder and then I'm going to set
underneath the eye so it doesn't crease
and it lasts long you want to make sure
you're not putting too much of this on
your face because that can actually
bring up those fine lines so look up
into the heavens as far as you can make
sure there is no fine lines and then go
in with your Beauty Blender I'll let
that sit for awhile all it does it's a
job we're gonna go to this side of my
face and on the wrong side what I'm
going to do is something that I would
always do because I loved just coverage
coverage coverage out of any and
everything that I used all right so
we're gonna use a compress powder that
it has a lot of full coverage I'm gonna
load up my brush to do this so I'm gonna
go ahead and do that
all over my face as you can see all my
fine lines here are very prominent it's
even creating fine lines in places that
I actually don't have fine lines in but
that's baked into my skin it's soaked in
it's not going anywhere it's not
creasing I'm gonna kick off that excess
powder I'm gonna take a brush any clean
brush that you have and just wipe it
away so you're probably thinking what
about the rest of your face so I have a
solution for that I actually don't like
setting the rest of my face with the
same powder you can and can set it with
a translucent powder I used the bronzing
powder as a form of setting the temple
forehead cheek bone all of that I do
with bronzer so I'm gonna take this
bronzer right here from Elsie's is a
matte bronzer I just loaded up my brush
I wanna tap off the excess because I
don't want any extra powder that I don't
need on my face what I like to do is go
in right to the forehead and the
cheekbone like that you can also contour
I'm gonna actually do that off-camera
so this side is nice sculpted set in
place okay this side just is making me
want to cry you can see the difference
okay so we are done with our makeup the
only thing we have left is to spritz on
a long-lasting setting spray but I
always use is
the mac prep and prime fix plus this is
the coconut one which I love is my
favorite one for the summer thank you
