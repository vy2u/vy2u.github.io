adilyn welcome back to another quick fix
video where I'm answering your requests
on Twitter
for some quick Beauty quick fixes I got
a request from Tracy and it says here
I'd love to see a fix it for dark
under-eye circles so Tracy I am fixing
your problem today as well as all of the
other girls out there who have those
dark under eye circles problems I have
them it's just genetics so I'm going to
show you how I cover my dark under-eye
circles let's begin share I am with no
under eye makeup we're going to start
off with using your favorite primer
today I'm using the Porefessional from
benefit I like the way it smooths over
all my fine lines and even adds a bit of
coverage which I honestly didn't know
until after reviewing this footage and I
saw like the big difference it made in
my complexion and the brightness of my
eyes so I will show you a still frame of
that after I apply it but you want to
use your ring finger to lightly tap on
the product into your under eyes and
over your lids so that the area is nice
and even and your application will go on
a lot smoother
here's the image I was talking to you
about it's like using facetune you know
the app it has to smooth over your skin
it literally smooth out your skin I was
so amazed by this that I don't think I
will be using face tune that much
anymore since I have this amazing primer
um so if you don't have this primer I
definitely suggest you go out and get it
so lately I've been using the sheer
cover concealer in light medium to cover
up my under-eye circles and I'm just
taking my ring finger and lightly
patting that into the inner corners down
to the nose and out extended past the
eye I like to do it this way because it
adds as a highlight for me and I'll use
a shade that's a couple times lighter
than my natural skin tone but if you
don't like that brightness under your
eyes then just use a shade that's orange
or peach undertone something natural to
your skin tone and that'll cover them up
just as well don't forget your upper
lids if especially if they're uneven
like mine I'll take the darker color in
the palette and put that on my lids
so that they're even but they're not as
bright as my under-eye circles or my
under-eye area so just remember to even
out your inner corners because those can
be the darkest parts of our eyes as well
as you can see my first layer of
concealer has done its magic but I also
like to go back in with my Maybelline
age rewind eraser because I love the
sponge application tip it has and I feel
like it gives you a really nice coverage
so after I've set that into the area
that I like it to be in I let it sit for
a while and then I'll go back in with my
ring finger to Pat lightly Pat it into
my skin so that it's nice and even and
of course we'll go back into the inner
corners and on the lids this is optional
but sometimes I'll go into a powder like
this one and just make sure that
everything is set in place but I don't
do this all the time because I have a
really dry skin and I find that it just
settles into my fine lines so if I'm
doing a video that I will go into my
powder for that extra coverage but
normally I'll just leave it as is to add
moisture and suppleness to my skin and
also set in the makeup I like to use the
Urban Decay vitamin complexion spray to
complete the look and this is the
completed coverage of the under eye
circles I hope you enjoyed the video and
if you have any requests please tweet me
on Twitter and I will feature you in my
next video thank you for watching don't
forget all the products are in the
