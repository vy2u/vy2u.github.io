about the hair color obviously it is a
huge change I am now pretty much blonde
it have like five different colors in my
hair that are similar to blonde I didn't
want to take away from the darkness at
the top just wanted something different
with the heck I'm just going to dye it
blonde so here it is I'm blonde so today
I'm doing a hair tutorial on how to do a
messy fishtail braid I usually do this
hairstyle if I want something quick and
easy and still really cute or if I have
two to three day old hair and I don't
want it down and I want a nice when I
want a cute quick hairstyle so I'll do
this and I'm not going to lie guys it
took me a while to figure out how to do
the fishtail braid I walked so many
YouTube videos on how to do a messy
fishtail braid and I figured out that
once you get the motion down with your
fingers it's easy and it's it's done
super quick but that's like the hardest
part I think it took me about three days
to figure out how to position my fingers
so I hope you guys like my new hair
color and my messy fishtail braids if
you want to learn how I got this then
keep watching here is what you'll need a
hairbrush clear elastic hair ties -
preferably for one for the top and the
bottom of the braid and first I'm
starting off with using my free your
main reviving spray this is great to use
when you're working with two to three
old day hair and your hair is needing a
fresh start it hydrates your hair and
since I just colored my hair it's great
to use because it helps extend the color
life and improves the chemical treatment
so that's what it says on the bottle and
I'm going to trust it for now and I'm
just working that through my hair and
then brushing out my hair making sure I
don't have any tangles in it or anything
like that
and since I'm working with three day old
hair I'm going to spray on the chlorine
dry shampoo to freshen it up
so now that my hair is fresh I'm going
to go ahead and put my hair into a
ponytail a side ponytail using a clear
hair tie
next I'm going to split my ponytail into
two parts the next part is the key to
the entire fishtail braid so watch
closely once you get this you'll know
how to do the entire fishtail braid like
nothing so here I'm taking a small
section of my hair from behind the left
ponytail and I'm going to pass it over
to the right ponytail and then take a
small section from behind the right
ponytail and then I'm going to pass it
over to the left side going to create a
criss cross shape like this and we're
going to repeat the process all the way
down the braid and so again I'm taking a
piece from the left side of the ponytail
and I'm handing it over to the right
kind of tightening it up and then taking
a piece from the right handing it over
to the left
like that
and going to continue to do this all the
way down so I figured out when you take
smaller pieces from the top in larger
pieces at the bottom the brave last
longer and it looks pretty awesome
another helpful tip is to not think
about it too hard once you cross a piece
over focus on picking up the next piece
I personally would get confused and pick
up another piece from the same ponytail
and I would get frustrated and irritated
so don't take it too serious just focus
on one side and then go to the next
so now we're at the bottom and we're
going to tie it with a clear elastic and
then grab some scissors and carefully
cut the elastic at the top so now that
I'm done with the fishtail braid I'm
going to just fan it out a little bit to
give it that messy texture and to make
sure that it keeps its shape while I do
that I'm going to spray some dry shampoo
this is from chlorine and I'm just going
to spray it lightly in there and now I'm
tugging and fanning the fishtail braid
out to give it that cute messy look this
is the final look I hope you enjoyed the
tutorial and found it helpful let me
know which other hair tutorials you'd
like to see and that's it until the next
video bye if you want to learn how I got
this messy messy fist bash bash

suggestion if you want to well just
