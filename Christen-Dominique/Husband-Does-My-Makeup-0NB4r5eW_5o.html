like a pretty cool name about my browser
I'm gonna do my brows a man I'm doing
I'm the one doing this why are you
putting it there this is for the
transition so I'm using this for a
transition you know it's all I'm almost
done with the transition here and I'll
put some white on it on top you know
so I can blend right I grab another for
the or the top of the transition we use
this white charmer sorry
good who what stop so you can mess up my
creation over here do you have to make
that style yeah I don't know if you guys

I'll be coming on 2016 this look it's
wait for it hmm I'm already getting
tired over here so then I'm gonna use
the Firecracker I know yeah I don't know
if you guys can see it yeah looks pretty
glittery that's actually my favorite
color firecracker is so nice
I'm gonna use that this is it right from
Sigma and another one for my Nastasia no
idea what they do it seems like these
are for your eye oh yes you pick the
right spot this was gonna give the
glittery effect on the eye whatever a
little bit more you know just to make a
look rave poppy yes
see I know what I'm doing down get
another brush because I don't want to
get uses same one
I think this is for brow use this for
brows to color the browsing to make it
look filthy no in there so I'm gonna use
this brush know what you know what
change my mind I'm gonna use this brush
because a little dinner and I'll be able
to fill it in there you know brow bar to
go so we're gonna make my brows look as
good as your brows so look no I don't
know if that's possible right
oops so you know if you mess up just
take it off it's okay your fingers not a
big deal
I just want to make sure they they're
nice and fill so on my brows to look
extra flaky I don't know if that's gonna
happen but I know the little piece of
eyebrow missing over here so you're not
gonna fill it in gotta do like that
chola so I have a confession when I'm in
a rush in Oh God okay well what's wrong
with you come down with it when I'm in a
rush I'm not gonna look over there
anymore when I'm in a rush I'll get a
shaver and I'll shave the extra hairs on
the bottom just like really quick and I
accidentally I did that the other day
and I suddenly took off half of my brow
so do not do that it's not gonna help
the situation something happened here
something's happening a lot of Asian
things some stuff is happening over here
hold on if you guys haven't tried the
Starbucks pralines
I think it's pralines and cream latte
it's so good it's like Christmas inside
of a cup besides peppermint mocha that's
another good one pralines and cream has
my heart
this is Starbucks advertisement that was
not sponsored Starbucks if you want to
sponsor me please just let me know okay
what I'm gonna do is just close my eyes
so movie it so I don't see I'm gonna be
surprised when I see how good you are
and this eyebrows are pretty dirty I
need to do the wing liner was the wing
kind of bouncy um next I'm gonna use
this ink liner this is pretty hard so I
should be able to get in underneath
underneath yeah
I don't make the winged liner extra
extra it would happen seeing on my
artwork over here wait wait I gotta go
over it oh now it's me oh no no what
just happened oh no it's taking out the
colors be honest with you guys I thought
I can do this under five minutes this
not happening right now
I wanted to make something very festive
you know something very holidays that's
why I chose this colors you know theme
like it was the appropriate thing to do
think you guys would like it you know
let me know if you recreate this I would
love to know a shag eazy-e's artwork
this is gonna be the easiest look you do
so don't worry
hmm you gonna need a water break never
felt my wing so flicked out this is a
little tip ticket so there's nothing
you're gonna fix this and this wingding
it oh man it's just a thought dang now
it just messed everything up struggles
are real right now I think we're good
now it's to the strobing no one looks
kind of weird right now
gotta step out of your comfort zone
think outside the box cuz you know
there's too many of the same looks out
there right now it's kinda heavy but
it's so heavy if it was to me to be
honest I will skip this this process
because it just seems like I probably
have to blend it yes cuz that's what it
seems like blender brush okay I'm gonna
use this thing because I don't looks
like it's a blendable brush mm-hmm yeah
it looks good yeah I would love to do
your makeup I wonder what you would look
like as a girl look pretty see under eye
circles gown so you can cover all that
beautiful imperfections I'm very excited
about this strobing I'm very very
excited I'm gonna use this makeup for
everything he's sculpting Oh already
starting I don't know if you guys can
see it tickets to do it on the
cheekbones and nose and the top of
eyebrows you know what I wanted to
really come up it looks pretty glowy
contour okay this is my favorite part
and then I'm gonna use darker shade here
first I'm gonna start with the side here
yeah and then the other side can't see
looks kind of like Joker a little bit no
Joker face Joker face was here and then
I have to blend it in I know how to
blend it in somewhere I might use this
big brush
make sure it goes all the way so it
doesn't look like Joker anyone know what
does it look like looks flawless I feel
like a pro I'm going back to the
eyeshadow because I feel like that's not
enough you want to make sure it really
stands out
I can clean this brush your quick or
little brush going to a lot of things
right now did the eyes showed you guys
how to do the strobing in the contouring
okay you see a little bit of shininess
going on I've almost forgot one of the
most important things here is to do down
I can't see you've got it in my eye no I
did it oh yes yes
working to you eyebrow oh yeah they say
the higher the Lima closer to God yeah
feeling that winged liner now all right
extra extra flicky here let me use a big
Brush cuz I think that's what you need
for blush did you put that much yeah you
see ah we got to do this this is what
you're supposed to do yeah make those
pop out Hey oh they got Jeff jealous up
my winged liner don't be hatin I think
it's the lips now okay and I'm gonna do
the Kylie Jenner lip so this goes around
the lip but you gotta get kind of draw
it in there
this thing it working like I need to
sharpen it alright hold on guys
we'll be right back it goes around the
lid let it get as close as you can all
right so then you grab this lipstick
lipstick and then it's not a negative
herb okay nobody okay so now let's put
it on there
it just makes you a little tan here do
that nice little tang and I know you
guys like to be tan stuck on their last
number one more glue here don't seem
that hard to put on I don't know why you
guys struggle on this but I'm putting
them on there pretty easy ah that's it I
think we're good with that and so we got
some lashes on there we got some blush
we got some contour now winged liner is
on fleek can I get a close-up of Hal a
shark that eyeliner is look at that

lacquered oh no this looks really good
