to my channel
hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today I'm gonna be doing my makeup you
know know if you guys hey guys welcome
back to my channel so today I have a
special guest with me my husband
Cesar he was here on my channel a few
years ago he did my makeup I felt so
long ago few years the was I was like 2
years feels like two years ago it took
me so long to get into this chair it
took so long for him to get to this
point in his life where I get to put
makeup on him he has been
procrastinating all day I mean he is
here it is 3:13 and we have two hours to
get speak jaded up in just a little bit
so we gotta do this I'm gonna beat his
face to perfection
so I'm actually really excited to see
what you're gonna look like with lashes
and like no hold on that is a no okay
not doing lashes the first thing I'm
gonna do is put on primer I'm going to
use the optical illusion primer from
early decay because your pores are out
to get me
that's nasty
oh no it feels really weird I fill in
all your pores so I don't know I liked
it that looks weird I hope I have the
right foundation color free I try to
choose the darkest one I have because
we're totally different skin color we
just want to say your dark okay so for
foundation I'm gonna use the Clinique
beyond perfecting foundation concealer I
don't want people touching my face no
this one's easier to apply hopefully
this is your skin color oh my god it's
so weird I don't know this is a good
idea I don't know if I want to do this I
don't even want it up you shouldn't look
actually we usually ask us to look no
not until the end where are you sir yeah
we're gonna cut this chin we're gonna
cut it off right now because he knows
what he looks like right now and I want
him to be surprised to see yourself no
okay oh I unplugged it alright so now
we're not cheating you can't see himself
on TV some fries okay so I'm gonna use a
Beauty Blender and I'm actually gonna
put more foundation on you them small
doesn't bother you guys no close your
mouth like this
I said go like this okay okay
kind of hide that beard this is actually
a good shape for you hey does feels like
you're counting my face it's much like
getting punch in the face

much beating as much as it takes cuz
this is a lot of beating it's like
somebody's like punching me flawless

do this do not do that you're gonna take
off the foundation okay so how do you
guys blow your nose you don't how much
more steps that we have I'm gonna take
the tart shaped cakes my favorite
concealer and we are gonna start on your
inner corners drag it down oh yeah it's
kind of interesting sitting here because
I'm gonna behind the camera it's pretty
annoying I wouldn't be able to do this
for a living that's why I do it and what
should I take you look like a warrior
you got a lot left we should do a 20
minute challenge because I don't feel
like being here for now London your
concealer to hide those under-eye
circles
hide those panda eyes drag it all the
way up to your cheekbone do you have to
do that to I ya know you don't know me

understand hair color Thank You wooden
brush through your brows where are you
supposed to is it supposed to be glam

special moment right now I'm definitely

Oh feel like my makeup should be done no
I don't think so
do not quit your eyes listen what your
eye Robin be up here I broke a massage
you're weird
now we're gonna move on to the eyeshadow
I'm going to be using the Urban Decay
Naked ultimate basics palette yes first
I'm gonna set your eyes your eyelids are
so creasing so bad close your eyes your
eyelids are creasing so bad okay I get
it I'm gonna go in with face I'm gonna
take this color right here close your
eyes oh that tickles
just use little circular motions
to work on their circular motions
seriously I take lethal right here I'm
going to add some more definition to
your outer crease most lamb I'd ever
seen I had to go change because I was
getting kind of chilly so I'm back with
the sweater I just feel like you just
enjoying this right now ah man okay you
have 45 minutes to dress and fly delayed
I'm gonna go in with this super glittery
shade from the moondust palette okay I'm
gonna take let's see which color should
we use do you want to pick color I
wouldn't think of color Specter this
pretty pink sparkly shade hmm tears are
coming out click no value too high feel
and a pat on the glittery pink shade on
your eye ooh this is pretty on your skin
tone actually it feels like this stuff
like is it like it's glitter can't put
on your eyes just like real glitter
stuff it's cosmetic grade glitter it's
fine I don't know about that I think is
the same I didn't I didn't agree to do
this I was I was forced to do it by the
way anybody else I was like it was held
against my will on this he's actually
tied to this chair right now good just
letting you guys know close your eyes do
a little baby wing yeah feel like is
going inside my eyes it's not my eyes
open right a little bit look all the way
this way click over here put look down

this is stressful I'm good on mascara on
this other side yeah oh yeah pretty
lashing how much do we have left
wow you do have a lot of lashes that's
good and you're buying no fake lash
either can you not weird
I can see my lashes I'm not supposed to
be able to see my lashes okay just hurry
up I really just wanted to suffer I mean
you take all this off okay and now we're
into some lashes on no or not I'm not
putting lashes on no way it takes - yah
my lash is already long I set your face
what does set your face mean I'm gonna
set all the foundation you can see there
in place so it doesn't move around so
I'm going to take the photo ball how
does it move around I don't get how does
even happens this stuff doesn't even
move around it's just fair because your
