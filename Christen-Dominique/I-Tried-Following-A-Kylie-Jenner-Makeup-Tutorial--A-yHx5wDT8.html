today I am doing a an I tried following
a Kylie Jenner makeup tutorial the
longest title ever I've been seeing
these videos go around for a little bit
so now it's my turn
hi she had 13 million views on this
video the makeup is extremely simple
it's easy this is her makeup routine but
I think this was like one or two years
ago if she comes out with a 20-18 one
you guys let me know because I would
really love to see that it's the way it
came out I think I pretty much nailed
her look it's really simple how she does
it and I actually learned some things
from her in this video that I've never
tried and I really like how I've made my
makeup look so if you want to see how I
got this look straight from kylie jenner
then don't forget to subscribe to my
channel and hit that notification
where's my finger going hit the
notification bells to give you a part of
the quad family and without further ado
did you check out our new logo for the
quad family how do you like it let's get
on with I tried to get everything that
Kylie used in her tutorial but I'm
missing a few things I figured it's okay
the thing I'm missing here for her
foundation is the Urban Decay Naked skin
one and done which I know I have
somewhere in my makeup collection I just
cannot find it to save my life I'm gonna
skip on that heart and just use the make
up for ever ultra HD is what I'm seeing
her hold in her snap
does she mix them together and the naked
skin one and done is kind of like a
medium coverage foundation that must
have been a lot of coverage to that day
for her and she said she put it on
lightly so I'm just gonna go straight
into the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
foundation and I have my Beauty Blender
and by the way this is a good foundation
I haven't used it in such a long time I
don't know why it's been a while but I
am in the shade Y 315 and just start to
work it onto my cheeks now she may have
so much more coverage because she has
the one and done mixed in there so I
just might need to pile it on today so
let's see how this foundation works by
itself okay I don't know about you guys
but when I'm not talking I have to play
music in the background I love playing
music and doing my makeup so soothing
and real
thing to me so now I remember why I used
to really like this foundation looks
very natural it looks like my skin but
thirty times better brow is in caramel I
don't have brow is I'm totally out every
time I have Rao is I'm usually done with
brow is in about a month it's super
quick I go through that pencil like
water the only one I have from Anastasio
right now is the brow definer in
chocolate she doesn't show filling in
her brows but I'm gonna fill mine in so
let me go ahead and fill these guys in
but I'm just gonna take a look at her
brows like a real close look
she has like perfect brows just gonna
try to mimic that somehow okay so this
area right here is pretty boxy it's like
more boxier than mine natural brow is
sir I'm gonna try to do that but at the
same time make it look as natural as
possible I said I wasn't gonna do her
brow shave and I'm like trying to call
if you're her brow shape exactly they
have a lot of natural hair so this is
kind of difficult for me to create on my
natural bald brows she was like the
perfect shape I just finished my brows
they actually don't look the same but
it's okay because my brows are not
sisters they're actually cousins we are
gonna move on to concealer so I don't
have the back of concealer but I try to
find a Paint Pot like a pot concealer so
I have this NARS one right here he gets
the concealer and she starts to carve
out her brow in the front first like so
and then she brings it down like this
this is exactly what I do I haven't done
this technique in such a long time I've
kinda like that it really shows the
shape elfs are carved out and the next
step is parting the top but I think it
was either a typo says using same
foundation on top but she's using the
same brush so what I'm gonna do because
I kind of agree with this I don't know
if it's a typo or not but if she uses a
foundation it's more natural-looking so
if you use that intense high coverage
concealer on top it may look not as
natural and just really super popped out
I mean you can blend it down but I think
it would look better with foundation so
I don't know if it was a typo or not but
I'm just going to
foundation so I'm gonna take the ultra
HD foundation on this concealer brush
she's basically just cleaning up the
front from what she's showing so that's
what I'm gonna do and because I don't
want to look like one of those funny
Instagram memes I'm just gonna go right
in the center just to make sure
everything matches and soften it I was
making a blunder okay so the next part
for this kylie jenner tutorial is the
laura mercier translucent powder
she puts life yes I agree this freakin
powder is amazing I feel like there's
other powders that just came out that
are just as good but again this is kind
of an old video so let's see what she
does set that mean okay so she puts it
all over her eyelid I never thought
about doing that I usually use an eye
shadow like a pressed eye shadow to set
my lid but for some reason I never
thought of using this and I think it's a
really good idea I think I'm gonna steal
this little tip from her okay so it
looks like Shirdi has shadow on and I
feel like it could be that original
bronze palette but because I've used
Kylie's palettes in two of my previous
videos I'm gonna switch it up for you
guys today I'm gonna use this one from
colour-pop this one just came out I just
got the PR package the palette is super
cute I feel like all of these colors is
something that she would use especially
in this tutorial so I'm gonna take this
one this is called mo problems I'm gonna
mix a little tiny bit of this I'm gonna
put that all over my lid just have a
natural wash of color I think that's
pretty good it's not like too intense it
look like she has just like a natural
wash of shadow for her crease it looks
like she was using a very bronze orange
undertone kind of shadow so I'm gonna
choose this one here from the palette
you could really tell in the video that
she's using a really light hand when
she's doing her makeup which lets me
know that she definitely knows what
she's doing because in order to have
clean makeup you need to use a soft hand
so I like that she's using a soft hand
because you know that's one of my
biggest things that I tell you guys it
comes out be best when you do so a soft
hand is basically if you knew you're new
to my channel is when you have a very
light pressure on your brush and you're
just letting it glide across your skin
you're not really pressing down so I'm
gonna go ahead and do this crease right
here it looks like she took it out a
little further a great down to the end
of her tail so I'm gonna bring it down
Wow do you guys see that dandruff it's
just out to say hi to everybody so for
the next part of the video it looks like
she is using a dome-shaped dense kind of
brush it's basically the same shape it
looks like it might be the same density
so I'm gonna go with this one and she
just takes a darker Brown I'm gonna take
strike it and fortunate work it on my
eyelid seems to be starting like right
in the center and then trying to thicken
it out towards the outer part of the eye
and just go back and forth it's kind of
thick bring it in like this
so the next step she's showing the NARS
concealer and I believe she's using
custard it looks like in the video I'm
using canal canal is like my perfect
shade okay already looks like she has
concealer on so I'm going to wow look at
these little baby hairs it looks like
she has it all underneath her eye like
this kind of like in a angle very close
to her eyelid so I'm gonna put it way up
here and it's just like a tiny clip of
her going back and forth and then the
next clip
she already has all the concealer in the
right spots so I'm gonna look and I have
it paused to where she's just like
showing us she's basically her placement
ever concealer so I'm just gonna look at
it because I never put it there so crazy
she puts it right in here crazy like a
little Hitler mustache and she also puts
it on the center she dragged it all the
way through the center it's just kind of
like in there somewhere
right yeah she puts it in there and then
she draws it oh she does it all the way
up here all the way but she does drag it
out like right in here look on the side
of her nose like right here she drives
it out like this well this is exactly
how I like my concealer - except for the
this part I don't know maybe to hide
like the redness or broken capillaries
or something
we'll see what her magic does to my face
hopefully I look like Kylee by the end
of this video okay there we go
okay hers is actually a little bit more
clean than mine you know we try and now
she's just blending it in with her
Beauty Blender and then it's all blended
okay so we're gonna blend it in with our
Beauty Blender wetting her Beauty
Blender so her baking doesn't look too
cakey so she just baked okay so she
skipped all the process but we're gonna
go ahead along with my Laura Mercier
translucent powder and just start to
bake it up she said not to let it sit
for too long so I'm gonna let it sit for
like two seconds
so next she says fave powder who showed
me I don't have that Chanel powder but I
do have a favorite powder foundation
kind of like the one of like the Chanel
one this has been my favorite go-to
powder foundation and I'm in the shade
medium just just dusting it on with a
brush so I'm gonna take her brush
actually this is the Kylie brush so
she's on her lower lash line it looks
like like a bronzy color so I'm gonna do
the same she has kind of a fatter brush
I'm gonna use the same thing I used for
my crease I'm gonna use it my lower lash
line now it looks like she's showing the
benefit hoola bronzer which I have right
here it's like an all-time favorite for
a lot of people starting here on her
cheekbone then she goes up around here
okay she did the like number three like
that and then right on then joined to
the next step in her tutorial which is
this Anastasia brow gel which I don't
have it's a clear brow gel so I just
grabbed my clear brow gel from our glass
just combs it up homes it through okay
now she's onto the blush now she's using
a blush that I don't have this one is
from Sephora it looks like a peach blush
one of my favorite all-time favorite
peach blushes is this one right here
from Tarte
it's called captivating it's just the
perfect peach blush that looks good on
everyone skin tone no matter what color
you are usually it looks pretty good
pretty close in oh I just realized she
puts it really close to the nose and
then brings it out but really close to
this area so I'm gonna bring it in a
little closer I never really bring it in
that close but I feel like this gives
you more of like a youthful look kind of
reminds me of my Korean makeup versus
American makeup now we're on two scares
me everytime so okay it looks like she's
using a gold eyelash curler curling my
little baby hairs wow her did you see
her lashes her lashes are so long I'm
going to cheat this one because my
lashes are nothing like Kylie's and if I
want to look somewhat similar I'm gonna
have to do some fake ones so after the
mascara I'm gonna pop in
you know some lashes really quick and
discreet for mascara she uses a Lancome
mascara so I have this one right here is
the only Lancome one I have it's called
Hypnose drama and coat my lashes so I'm
wearing the Lily lashes in diamonds
today I think they were super natural
right hey so we popped on some lashes
now she's moving on to using a Sephora
jumbo stick I don't have that either she
does a lot of Sephora makeup that's
crazy I didn't realize that she did so
I'm gonna take my bad just all these
texts coming in at one time I'm gonna go
ahead and take something that's similar
to that so for a jumbo Stix is the urban
decay 24/7 glide-on eye pencil in the
shade smog it looks a little metallic II
from the cap in her video and she said
she likes it because it's like really
soft so I'm gonna take that on the inner
waterline looks like she's using that
right in there now she's using Kandy K
lipliner and she just fills in her
entire lips so I'm just gonna copy ur
because she does her lipliner she shows
that she's wearing the Jacqueline Hill
champagne pop from Becca and I have that
right here so I'm gonna jump into the
highlight in this next map she's just
basically showing off how pop in the
highlight is then she jumps to the gloss
so I have the gloss right here so I'm
gonna top that off on top of candy Kay
so I don't look like highly general yet
but that's okay because I think my
makeup is pretty much on point to hers
