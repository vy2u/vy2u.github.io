welcome back to my channel I'm glad to
be back welcome me back to my channel I
feel like I haven't been in my little
set in a while so I'm really happy to be
back with you guys today I'm doing an
effortless makeup tutorial hair and an
outfit idea if you're on the go running
late or you know what you're just
feeling lazy yeah I probably do this
hairstyle every other day so that tells
you a lot about how I feel yeah it's
super easy and quick so if you want to
get to learn look so if you want to know
how to get this look that keep watch the
first thing I'm going to do is apply my
magic skin in a bottle it's the
Porefessional it makes my skin looks
super flawless it fills in all these
like fine lines pores and it just evens
out my skin tone so I'm going to quickly
apply that before I do any type of
foundation or concealer
so I figure less steps is easier and
faster so I'm going to use my covers X
total cream cover Foundation and this is
super heavy-duty it's basically like a
foundation and concealer so I'm just
going to apply that all over my face and
if you don't have this you can use
anything else that's just like a
one-step trick this is something you'd
probably could do at the stoplight in
your car although I'm not saying to
drive and do any other extra activities
that's never safe now I'm going to take
my honest hacia brow Wiz and I'm going
to fill in the sparse areas of my brows
just so that they can look even
I'm gonna curl my lashes before I apply
my mascara and I'm doing this because
once my mascara dries it hardens and it
could break off my lashes and also if
you're using a wet formula it could make
your lashes really clumpy
so that's why I curl my lashes before so
I'm trying really hard not to use my
eyeliner my winged liner for me a casual
like effortless day would just be a tiny
winged liner but I know that's not
practical so I'm just going to go ahead
and skip on the winged liner today as
hard as it is and go straight to the
mascara my favorite mascara for sure
especially if I'm not going to wear
lashes or anything is the Vincent Longo
mascara it's a dry formula so I feel
like it holds your curl longer and now
I'm going to apply generous coats to my
upper and lower lashes
you
now I'm going to take my city color be
matte blush in blackberry and I'm gonna
apply this to my cheekbones going up
towards my temple and then around my
crease just to add a flush of color to
my face
for my lips I'm going to use the lolli
balm from benefit and I've been using
this a lot lately I just got it and I
like the color a lot but it smells
really weird it smells like perfume like
you're putting a perfume on your lips
but the color is nice so if you can't
stand that then it's probably not for
you but I like it because of the colors
though I'm gonna put that on it's very
natural it's just a light pink blush on
your lips so I think that's really
really cute for the inner corners i'ma
pop on a highlight just to open my eyes
up and make me look like I'm awake and
not freaking out about being late so I'm
just going to pop that into the inner
corners and you can grab any highlight
that you have mine's just happens to be
in this big old palette so that's why
I'm grabbing it
and the reason I'm pushing it up with
without clamping it is because that
usually clumps them all together
especially with this mascara so that's
why I'm just doing this and it's such a
dry mascara that it'll just bend to
wherever shape whatever shape you like
so that's why I'm doing that all right
so now I'm going to do my effortless
quick hair basically I do this on when
I'm lazy I kind of feel like I it's
crazy to show you guys because it's so
easy but let me do it and if some of you
guys have asked on Twitter on Instagram
so let me show you so I'm just putting
my hair in a simple ponytail
so yeah this is probably most of my days
putting my hair up in a ponytail and
what makes it look kind of chic I guess
is I cover the band with my hair to give
it a nice fluff at the top I pull from
the center and then I'm just grabbing
some hair from the back of my ponytail
you can grab as much as you like to make
it thicker or a thinner band and then I
just like to brush that strand and ernõ
it's on a strand but if that piece of
hair and then wrap it around the
ponytail and then tuck that piece of
hair into the rubber band and then I
just like if it's messy I don't mind it
try to fluff it up a little bit and yeah
that's it it's super easy and quick so
now I'm going to show you my outfit
you
this is the final ponytail look I think
it's super quick and cute and if you do
this ponytail or makeup look make sure
