Caesars here today hi everyone welcome
back to my channel so today I'm gonna be
doing a celebrity inspired look I'm so
excited about this celebrity because I
haven't done a video a celebrity
inspired video in a really long time I
ran across this picture of Jessica Alba
right here she looks so gorgeous this is
kind of like the look she always does
but she just glammed it up with some
eyeliner and lashes so I feel like a lot
of you guys would like this you can wear
it pretty much anywhere to any kind of
event it's very wearable glowing and
bronzy I think you guys would love it so
if you want to learn how to get it then
keep watching alright so now it's time
to create a smooth base I'm using the
makeup forever primer and this is the
hydrating line to even out my skin tone
I'm using the Armani luminous silk and
I've been using this one a lot you've
seen it a lot of my videos I love how it
evens everything out and the coverage is
awesome and to hide my under-eye circles
and highlight my face I'm using the
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer if you
guys have dark under-eye circles this is
great for you because it has full
coverage and it's very lightweight I
just got this Tarte sponge in I'm using
it right now it is kind of stiff
definitely the beauty blenders a lot
softer and blends a little bit better
but maybe if I apply water to it I don't
know maybe I needed to try that out but
um it doesn't job
now I'm going to take the papi picnic
palette from Tarte that's a tongue
twister um especially for it being
really early in the morning right now
I'm gonna take the lightest color and
lay that down on the inner third of my
eyelid
and now I'm going to take this taupe
color here and I'm going to wash it all
over the outside of my lid also in the
crease I'm also gonna sweep it on the
lower lash line and now I'm gonna take
this darker Brown here this is the
second darkest Brown they have and I'm
going to work this into the outer part
of the lid and as you guys can see I'm
using a couple different brushes don't
worry every brush I use it's gonna be
linked in the description box below I
didn't have I didn't feel like I'm being
lazy so I just pinched the end just so I
can apply it really close to the lash
line and I'm taking the darkest color
and I'm going to focus this right on the
outer part of the crease and work it
inwards and this is just using a slat
brush and then I blended it out with a
blending brush with a fluffy brush
Jessica has a gold color going on in the
inner part of her lid so I'm picking up
magic act this is from makeup geek it's
a beautiful color virus it's super
pigmented and I'm just applying that to
the inner part of my lid with a flat
shader brush then I'm just gonna blend
out the edges of this color with a
blending brush and I'm going to add the
darkest Brown to the outer part of the
lower lid lower lash what is that lower
lashline I'm gonna take this color right
nope not that color the color right
above it and that's the matte cream
color I'm gonna highlight my brow bone
with it
and then we'll get down into the other
colors everything transitions nicely and
looks blended now I am I have no brows
I'm losing without the Browns
I'm taking my perfect brow pencil from
honest Asya this is a soft brown I like
to use this guy when I'm like on the go
I just want to get you know fill in my
sparse areas really quick and go
otherwise I'll use my ash Brown it's a
pomade from the Montes dasya and that
one works really good too
it'll be my eyeliner out Jessica really
didn't have too much of a wing going on
but you know I like my wings so I just
thought I'd throw that in there she does
have a small baby wing it's just not as
sharp as mine so you can definitely use
a eye pencil instead of a liquid liner
if you want for my lashes I'm going to
use these House of lashes in all natural
and I'm stacking two of them together
because they're very thin in the picture
that I'm looking at Jessica Alba has a
natural full kind of wispy and lashes
and this kind of mimics that so that's
I'm going to use these alone they're
really thin so it wouldn't work alone
but stack together like this it works
perfectly for her look so I'm gonna take
my favorite eyelash glue which is I
talked about it in my last favorites
video this is from thrive cosmetics and
I'm gonna take it and just put a thin
strip along the band and it's gonna last
all day and I have a party tonight so
that's perfect
I've heard the house of lashes blue is
really good too I haven't tried it yet
you guys let me know below and if you've
tried it but for me thrive Cosmetics is
the best lash glue I've tried in a
really long time and so that the lashes
winged out with the wing and have that
flare at the end I'm just gonna turn
them upwards and I raise the end a
little higher so that gives you that
flick at the end now I'm just gonna line
my lower lash line with a black liner
so what I've been doing lately is doing
my eyes and then do my foundation later
so I can fix any fallout or eyeliner but
but what I'm going to go over my
foundation again so give me a little bit
more coverage to set my foundation I'm
gonna use the Urban Decay Naked light
pressed powder and I'm just gonna
lightly dust it on just to make sure
everything stays in place
and then I'm gonna go in with my mana
kadar powder and c3 and highlight
underneath my under eyes next I'm in a
contour I'm going to use this shade
light palette from Camp Kat Von D I'm
just going to take the darkest color in
the palette 109 from zoeva and I'm going
to use this to contour my face I'm going
to do just around my the hollow areas of
my cheekbones and my nose she has a very
soft makeup look so I'm not going to do
too much heavy contouring
so now I'm gonna highlight I'm using
this pinkish color right here and you're
gonna go down the bridge of my nose
center of my forehead and just gonna put
a little bit more on the tip of my nose
just so that it's pronounced and I am
also going to apply it right underneath
my under eyes and right on the tops of
my cheekbones I'm gonna take my pro
bronze from Make Up For Ever this is a
new one for me just got this one in and
I am so excited to use it Jessica Alba
has a very glowing look it's bronzy and
glowing so instead of blush I used
bronzer and then for my lips I'm using
tipsy ones by colour-pop one of the main
reasons besides making my lips look
fuller because the ends of my lips are
really thin so I like to even that out
and a for my lipstick I'm using gerard
cosmetics in buttercups one of those
staple nudie pinks that everybody should
have I hope you guys enjoyed my sexy
morning boys
