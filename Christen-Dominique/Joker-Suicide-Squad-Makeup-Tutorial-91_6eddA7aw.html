hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today I am filming Joker Suicide Squad
edition I glammed it up a little bit you
see that green highlight though hmm
anyways if you want to learn how to get
this look then keep on I am a boy I am
back at it again this time I'm Joker
okay so I am gonna start off with making
my face pretty pale I'm gonna be using
the Lancome a 24 hour makeup it's super
full coverage I used it in my Harley
Quinn video I'm so gonna use it again
because I like the way it came out and
I'm gonna take a Beauty Blender and work
that into
these contacts they get a lot of
questions on there from solid oka
they're the natural quartz oh I'll have
a link below I really like them because
they look very natural and I think in
this look they're gonna really pop out
feel like that that guy on that what's
that movie there's like special powers
that goes by the Walker and like I
forgot the name if you know their name
in comment below it's a good movie -
nobody likes somebody bullies him okay
so now I'm gonna go into my eyebrows I'm
gonna fill them in with this cream gel
liner from colour-pop in teaspoon I'm
just going to follow the natural shape
of my brows you know what I'm gonna use
an angled eyebrow brush just so we can
get better precision cuz this is like I
switched up the eyebrow color to this
palette right here this is the makeup
forever 12 color case palette and I'm
using this screen right here and mixing
it into the white to make it a little
bit lighter because this little guy is
just hanging on for dear life I'll use
it for another day so I'm gonna go back
into that and start to work and work it
into my brow I'm gonna mix a little bit
of this Brown into the brush just so we
can add some hair like definition I mean
obviously this is not a natural look but
I'm gonna try to make it as realistic as
possible I'm going back and forth into
this green this Y and then this brown
one right here how much is the same
thing to the other side just so it has
some dimension in the brows I remember
seeing jared leto in another movie and
Caesar had told me that he was the guy
version of me not such a good that's
that's not a compliment but now I take
it as a compliment
this thing for Halloween works miracles
on any look that you decide to do
because it has so many colors and then
you can mix the colors up it's amazing
I'm gonna use this screen from Mac this
is new crop and I'm gonna take this dark
brown right here and do little flecks of
hair like strokes just so it looks a
little bit more dimensional I'm gonna
take this white shade right here and
just cover the entire lid Upton's up
into the brow bone it's gonna help
everything go on a lot smoother because
the eye area can crease up pretty bad
especially with this really light makeup
so it's good to set it
so I'm gonna go around my eyes with this
light taupe color and then I'm gonna go
around it with this one right here these
are all matte shades use my Mac 224 just
to work that into the crease and the lid
just want to create dark shadows all
around the eye okay so to work the brown
shade on the lower lash line I'm gonna
take this morphe M 5:03 brush it's a
little more flat so it's gonna help work
it in there now I'm gonna take my Mac
never say never it's a red right here
and I may go into this one too just so
you guys know because this looks a
little bit lighter than this one so I
might use both of them but I'm just
gonna do the same thing work it into the
lid in the crease and then I'm gonna pop
it into the bottom as well then for my
waterline I'm gonna use this red for
this red lip liner from Urban Decay it's
called Rocksteady and I'm just gonna
apply it to my waterline so it should
look like
okay and then on my lid I'm gonna work
in make up for Evers black what is this
glide on eye shadow and I'm just gonna
pop it onto my lid and blend it upwards
to my brow bone and I'm just gonna use
this as a base on my lid and then I'm
gonna use a black eyeshadow over it and
then I'm gonna take a black eyeshadow
and then just go over it and then start
to blend it out I'm also gonna take it
on the lower lash line - okay so now I'm
gonna contour
actually let's finish the eyes I'm gonna
put on some mascara and some lashes just
to make it a little bit more glam let's
see do we want to do I think we're good
with the smokey eye maybe using the
Lancome Hypnose drama mascara now I'm
gonna put on some lashes to make it a
little bit more glam I'm gonna use these
Amy June lashes in Daniella then I'm
gonna take a little bit of this Brown
right here and work it into the lower
part right below the black and the red
okay now I'm gonna do a little bit of
contouring actually a lot of contouring
has a really skinny nose okay so now I'm
going to contour my cheeks and I'm gonna
do the same thing I'm gonna first use
this taupe shade and then we're gonna
add extra definition into the deepest
parts of bone right on the hollow area
with the black and then I'm going to
take some face powder this is the Urban
Decay Fair cool this is gonna set our
foundation it's also gonna help blend
out any harsh lines that you have you
know I'm going to take this red shade
right here and my angled brush and
I hate a little red scar right on the
top of I and right on the bottom so now
I'm gonna do little cracks around my eye
and I'm gonna use black a little bit of
this black and a little bit of white
I'm gonna add a little bit of a
highlight to my cheeks this is artist
Couture's mermaid it has a little green
reflex in it so it's gonna be perfect
for this book it's a little glam Joker
obviously doesn't have high light but I
want to make him a little bit of a glam
version so I'm gonna take my morphe and
5:01 brush I'm gonna fill my lips in and
line them up with this red lip liner
from Urban Decay and then I'm gonna go
back around it with a black lip liner
and then I'm gonna take this black next
eyeliner in line at the outside of my
lips I'm gonna go over everything with
this you a Cabernet liquid lipsticks but
I'm gonna stay away from the outside
so now all is left is to put on the
tattoos you can draw them but I'm going
to take the easy way out and just stick
them on my face</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
