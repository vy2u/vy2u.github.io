ribbon I found on a package you gotta
get creative there's only so many things
you could wear over and over just gonna
pretend like this is an actual choker
can you hear me oh I'm gonna have to get
up I'm back one more time welcome back
to my channel so it's Jay I have some
really exciting thing BAM
the Kylie Jenner Kylie cosmetics the
bronze palette every time I say it I
have to say Kylie Jenner and Kylie
cosmetics I actually got my hands on
this palette I will tell you how I got
this palette later on in the video
I'm creating a look with this today and
this is what I created you like it yeah
and I also got part of her birthday
collection I can get the whole
collection because it sold out in like
30 seconds and then I also got to
lippies a matte one it's in here
somewhere
I got Lord which is a matte metallic lip
and then I got this gloss right here
it's itch which the name is poppin
gorgeous I love gold I love gold
packaging it has a special place in my
heart so if you want to see how to get
this look right here then go ahead and
keep watching thank you to cry my face
do use my Smashbox sort of finished
primer right here work that to my face
this is a oil-free silicon based primer
silicone primers are going to get into
your pores and smooth them out so it's
so important when you use these primers
to really don't get lazy
wash your face they do get into your
pores that's what makes your skin look
smooth you know I love this foundation
this foundation is my favorite right now
the Estee Lauder Double Wear stay in
place it makes your skin look so
flawless and it looks really natural on
your skin too so I love it and I'm just
going to go ahead
work my beauty blender into it it's nice
and clean if your foundation doesn't
match the bottom of your choker
something is wrong okay I just screwed
this choker up oh my god I'm going to
move the choker
while my foundation sets I'm going to do
my brows really quick I'm gonna do them
off camera it will be back and before we
get into the eyeshadows I'm going to put
on T Kat Von D color correcting
eyeshadow primer to work this on my lid
you guys know I don't really use primers
too often so I must be way excited I
like it because it's not too pale
looking on my eyes so I have the high
shadow palette right here it's so pretty
a teardrops are the same shades as the
palette inside and if she does this with
every palette this is so genius genius
in the palette and it's done done done I
love all of these shades all these
shades I pretty much use all the time
this palette is just the perfect pallet
orange in the middle perfect dark black
dark brown reddish brown everything you
need is in this palette so the shavings
are on the back of the palette right
here I'm thinking I'm going to go ahead
and take Jasper and apply it all over my
lid I'm going to start at my lid and
then work it all the way up to the brow
bone okay this is a lot lighter than
what I thought it was but we'll work
with it just happen with the raccoon eye
all the time our line is fine if you
have really close-set eyes and as you
can see mines go in pretty deep right in
the center make go ahead and use a matte
highlight in that area so it doesn't
look as Hollow and it adds a little bit
more volume to that space so it looks a
little bit more youthful and bright as
I'm putting Jasper all over my move and
done it's easy
what eyeshadow and you're ready to go
I'm gonna pick up topaz is this right
here I'm hoping and I'm gonna work that
into the crease this is really really
pretty I love this topi shade there
isn't very much fall out at all which is
awesome and it's super pigmented which
is nice but it's blendable staying at
the end of my brush so that everything
slides on a lot easier and a lot lighter
obsessed I'm going to take this orange
shade right here at the shade Citroen
Citroen Citroen Detroit Citroen or its
citrus I'm going to take this shade
right here and use it as my transition
actually going to take the same brush
breaking all the rules today I'm going
to focus this on the crease area and I'm
gonna hold the brush towards the back
and start to fluff to buff you just
start to buff this into my crease like
right above the crease I just want a
hint of that orange I think orange looks
so pretty on any eye color and just
really helps to bring out all the shadow
and then I'm going to go ahead and go
into Tiger I start to work that on to
the inner and outer part of the crease
the inner and outer part of the crease
this ooh I like the way this is looking
she got all my favorite shades and just
popped it into this palette I actually
tried to get this palette several times
and didn't quite make it very very hard
it sells out in like 30 seconds I had to
borrow my friend game she let me borrow
it Thank You Gabe he actually did a full
review on this palette I'll link his
video below so you guys can watch the
in-depth review I'm gonna focus tiger's
eye on both sides of the crease / lid
because we're kind of bringing it up to
the crease right you see that yeah I'm
bringing it up to the crease take this
shade right here this is called hematite
I'm gonna go ahead and take some of this
shade right here beautiful reddish-brown
I'm going to go ahead and layer that
right on top of the outer corner and
inner corners I'm going to take a little
bit of this shade right here to deepen
up the outer part of the lid
the inner part I'm just trying to use
all the shadows in his fala and they're
all good for the crease I'm gonna have
like seven different layers of crease
color so now I'm going to take bronze I
focus this on the lower part of the
outer crease I'm using more of a narrow
brush this Smith 230 I want to focus it
in a smaller area and I don't want it to
be everywhere because I still want all
those other shades to peek through you
can see I'm coming towards the middle of
my brush I want to put down a little bit
more pressure when you keep it out here
it's good if we're just blending in a
bigger space you just want a soft smooth
blend but if you want a little bit more
focus start to work your hand downwards
but we're going to go Midway because we
still want some flexibility you don't
want too much control but I do want it
very close to the lashline the next
shade I'm going to go into is obsidian
I'm just going to take a little bit of
this one not going too crazy with it and
take the same brush hop into obsidian
which is this matte black and I'm going
to start to work this just on the lower
part of the lash line for the inner part
of the lid I'm going to take this
beautiful color right here this is gold
stone I'm going to pop that onto just
right on the center part of the lid I've
seen so many different looks with this
palette everything that I did to the
sides I'm going to just do to the bottom
I'm going to fast forward that this is
the only thing that I can get my hands
on when I went to go buy birthday
collection I got the eyeliner which
comes with a bronze gel it also came
with this eyeliner pen soul feels like
it oh I got a little brush right here to
apply liner so I'm gonna go ahead and
take my bronze eye pencil and put it on
to my waterline okay I'm trying to put
this on my waterline but it is not this
is what it looks like on my hand which
isn't bad at all maybe just doesn't work
as good
water line let's see maybe if I put it
here okay that works better or the gel
liner actually let me see if this is
gonna work it's exactly the same
I like the gel over and there's these
little gold flecks in the brown gel
liner which is awesome it's not
overwhelming or glittery though which is
nice I'm going to add a wing right on
the top of my lash line I don't want to
bring it in too much I kind of want to
taper it to where it disappears ooh I
like that way I'm not used to the brown
wings on my lid but this is dark enough
to where it's okay but it's not like I
like dramatic we can try to keep it
Brown I don't know if I'm going to keep
it Brown so I'm going to try to let's do
this together pray that the other side
and matches decide I think that I like
the darkness of the liner but it's just
too light for me so what I'm gonna do
I'm not going to do black I got to do
different looks is a beauty channel I'm
gonna go ahead and take bronze eye right
here going to layer that on top with a
winged liner brush which I have a really
good one actually use this for my brow
because of the way it's shaped gone this
is so tiny I love brushes like this for
my brows but I'm going to use it for my
eyeliner this is the Sigma V o6 winged
liner brush use it just doing my
eyeliner try mine me
I'm just going to take some concealer
brighten my under eyes some bitch
actually this to do this before I got
here
we're going to set our foundation and
concealer let your foundation concealer
dry don't go right into it it wet it's
gonna look really patchy and just so I'm
just going to wait a little bit and then
I'm going to set my foundation with I'm
so excited actually know about this is
the Kat Von D translucent powder you
know that contour brush that I always
use well Real Techniques has one very
similar pretty much the same guys this
flat side and for my under-eye I am
going to use urban decay light warm
shape this is the Smith
115 just going to bring some of that
underneath now I'm going to go ahead and
contour a bit I'm going to use my
Smashbox contour looks like so err
contour my nose I'm going to tell you
that right now this is way too much well
there's definitely going to be a shadow
there I'm actually going to bronze up my
face with this Tarte powder foundation
use this as a bronzer this isn't an
honey I'm just because I have some
texture right here it's going to help
add coverage and at the same time give
me that bronzed looking some color into
my face to get around the temples
oh it gives you more of a smoother look
also bring some warmth to your face
these are face a little bit more color
and dimension I'm gonna use
kathleenlights collaboration with makeup
geek this is the highlighter palette she
created and get really big pans yes
Kathleen oh my God look at this
highlight you barely swipe it and it's
BAM like right in your face I'm going to
use this for the inner corners highlight
is so intense I love it oh my god this
is gonna be my favorite highlight
palette for fade Zee vibes coming on
very strong I wasn't able to get all of
the shades I got Lord I got the matte
shade and I got the gloss which to me
it's like mmm they weren't my favorite
like this wasn't my favorite Lord the
packaging is beautiful I love the
packaging but this color I don't know
her
see this one looks really orange e I
like pop in though I think popping this
on to the center is gonna really make
your lips pop and there's a lip kit
because this is a Kylie makeup look so
I'm gonna use exposed specially just
gonna fill in my entire lip exposed is a
beautiful color so gorgeous pick it up
and back you know what since I'm not
used to it I'm gonna leave it on because
something different that I wouldn't do
and it kinda goes with everything
everything's bronze orange e reddish I
think it goes great now I'm going to
incorporate these into something this is
the matte shade this in word likes or I
don't know how I feel about paying this
on my lips I just really like the way
this looks maybe is a highlight so I'm
going to take pop in now and I'm just
gonna put it right where I put my MA
lippy this is too orange for me I'm not
gonna lie to you guys
I don't not feeling it would really feel
like I'm putting on 100 layers of matte
liquid lipstick not a challenge going
around um and that's the finished look
what do you guys think you guys would
have definitely told me and I know you
guys would have told me that that was on
my teeth
