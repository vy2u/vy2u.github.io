Perry Dark Horse inspired makeup look I
thought it would be fun and I love this
song so thumbs up if you love it too and
thanks to those of you who follow me on
instagram and helped me decide on which
look to do so if you want to see how I
got this look then let's begin first I'm
starting off with my Urban Decay primer
potion for a more vibrant crease free
color for base I'm taking the Sigma
liner in my cloud and applying that all
over the lid now I'm using the urban
decay shadow and shattered and packing
it on top of the lid to brighten the
blue color and add a bit of a metallic
sheen now I'm just blending the edges
with my Mac 217 blending brush using
either windshield wiper motions or a
circular motion whichever blending
technique you'd prefer from the vice -
palette and taking the color lovesick
which is a matte black with silver micro
glitter and I'm patting that into my
crease and then with my uruvela blending
brush in a circular motion I'm blending
the color upwards towards the brows next
I'm taking the color polyester bride and
placing that on my brow bone and
blending it downward into the other
colors
to add a shimmer all over the look and
taking the next roll on shimmer and
light blue and patting that all over the
lid now with my liquid liner from NYC
I'm going to add an exaggerated winged
liner and for the inner corners I'm
extending it past the inner corner close
to the nose for an exotic elongated eye
I'm also using the liner on the bottom
lash line extending it parallel to the
top wing so that you create a double
wing go ahead and fill in the waterline
with a black pencil liner here I'm using
the LA girls gel liner pencil it's super
opaque and I absolutely love this liner
next katie has a third line under the
eye like so so I'm just drawing that out
using a Mac gel liner in black track I'm
creating somewhat of an upside down
triangle and curl on the bottom lash
line
now I'm going to add the gold glitter
here I'm using a gold glitter liner
since it's the only gold glitter that I
currently have so I'm going to take this
liner and pop it on the inner corner and
fill in the gaps between the liners next
I'm going to curl my lashes and then
apply my current favorite mascara which
is the better than sex from Too Faced
next I'm taking my Ardell edgy lashes in
number 402 and applying a thin line of
glue let it dry for about 20 seconds and
then pop them on to the center of my lid
and attach each side let it sit for
another 20 seconds and voila now I'm
going back in with my liquid liner to
hide any glue marks
next I'm taking my city color blush quad
in choosing the lightest pink color in
the palette and applying it to my
cheekbones for the lips I'm keeping it
pretty neutral I'm using the NYX Xtreme
lip cream in the color pinky nude and
then I'm going to top this off with a
bit of Urban Decay's naked lip gloss and
the color of naked and this is the final
look I hope you enjoyed the Katy Perry
darkhorse inspired look and don't forget
