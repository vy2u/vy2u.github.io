hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today I'm going to be doing Kendall
Jenner's makeup I am transforming myself
into kendall Jenner I love the celebrity
inspired looks especially when they're
cheap and I can buy them very easy it's
all drugstores so it's very affordable
and anybody could get this look it's so
easy Kendall Jenner's looks are very
chic simple and put together I just love
her look you want to learn how to get
this look it's very bronzy glowy so easy
and you can wear this every day and I
love it if you want to learn how to get
it then keep watching this primer this
is from NYX this is the angel veil skin
perfecting primer and I'm going to go
ahead and work that into my skin so we
can have an even smooth surface this is
a really good primer oh this one really
softens out your skin I love it the
fills in all the pores and just just
makes it look very smooth even on camera
this is a very HD lens that I got for
foundation today I'm going to be using
the Milani conceal and perfect the
two-in-one foundation and concealer I'm
using shade number 7 today in sand
because I tanned last night and I'm a
lot of shades darker than my natural tan
my natural skin complexion and I just
cleaned my Beauty Blender so it's nice
and puffy
this Beauty Blender by the way it so
much pink dye came out of it it was just
nothing but peep dye I don't know if
that's good for your skin or not but I
try to squeeze as much as I could out so
I'm going to go ahead and start to put
this on my face so few shades darker
than my face but that's okay because it
matches my body even though I tanned my
face yesterday I just put a very light
amount of tan self-tanner on it just so
that it doesn't look really crazy I
remember it like in high school I put on
a ton of self tan and then I put it all
over my face and I looked so weird it
was it was really hard to go out in
public you just tell you that it was so
dark I look so weird I mean this was
literally what the definition of an
balumbo looks like if you don't know how
to be Luba is I'll post it right here
scary so excited to do these I love
celebrity recreations they're the
funnest ones to do if okay I have a
question for you guys if you could
choose to be Kendall or Kylie which one
would you choose let me know in the
comments I want to know how to choose
one I think I would just go with Kylie
okay now to brighten up the face I'm
going to be using the Maybelline master
conceal in light I like my under eyes to
be pretty bright feel like it makes you
look more awake more youthful this is a
very good concealer if you're looking
for something that's lightweight and
it's going to cover everything you want
to get this guy are just going to use my
ring finger to Pat it in I feel like
it's the easiest way to work in your
concealer because it warms up the
product and then it just melts into your
skin and blends so much easier I like to
bring it along the sides of the nose too
it makes it look a little bit more
narrow and I learned that trick from
Patrick Starr a very long time ago I
think it was like in 2013 or something I
use the rest to highlight my face right
here and right in the middle of the
forehead between the brow and it go
ahead and contour with this Maybelline
master contour the shape duo stick
contour and highlight on the hollow of
my cheek right here right there a little
bit right here I don't feel like I have
a large forehead so I feel like I don't
need to contour it so I just leave it
alone
I just mainly focus right here on the
hollows of my cheek bones this is going
to slim your face down and it's also
just gonna really give some structure
and definition to your cheekbone that
blend it out so easy I'm going to take
this other contour stick in the light
and just go down my nose with it while
all of this dries on my face I'm going
to go ahead and fill in my brows use the
Maybelline brow precise micro pencil
take a mirror because I need to be very
up close and personal with myself when
I'm doing my brows or else I can't see
what I'm doing I am so blind not even
funny so I'm gonna bring a mirror like
really
uncomfortably close to my face I'm going
to start right here where it's the most
spar cyst area and just we use like
little hairlike strokes make them as
straight and elongated as possible
because that's how her brows are
naturally since I already have the
foundation concealer on my lids I'm
going to go ahead and set my lids with
some powder I'm going to use this one
right here this is the Maybelline a
better skin skin transforming powder
this is going to help everything like
here a little bit better and it's also
going to have a nice smooth surface for
us to work on or the crease color I'm
going to take this wet and wild
all natural bare necessities palette and
I'm just going to take these two Browns
right here and place them in my crease
to give my eyes some definition and this
is just going to give your eyes some
natural-looking definition and blend it
outwards I'm also going to take the
shade and run it down the lower part of
my lash line you know what I need to do
I need to make a tiny fan brush just
like this just for the lower lash line
drag it out towards tail end of the brow
so now I'm going to go into this palette
right here this is from Maybelline it's
going to accentuate the crease just a
little bit more so I'm going to take
this shade right here
so for the lid I'm going to go ahead and
take this NYX eyeshadow in bedroom eyes
this is really pretty bronze shade right
here so I'm going to take my finger and
just dab it onto my lid I'm also going
to take that into the inner corner and
around the eye it's such an easy look
anybody can do it I'm going to blend it
out with a brush
currently talking to my mom you guys say
hi mom hi now I'm going to go in with a
brow bone color her brow bone is very
very matte it so I'm going to take this
shade right here from the NYX palette
this is the meet my Romeo palette
now I'm going to go ahead and do some
eyeliner I'm going to take my NYX vinyl
liquid liner this is actually really
good liner it's very black and I like
that the brush tip is so fine so you
really get to control the type the the
shape of your liner loving this liner
right now I'm going to go ahead and line
my underline underline my waterline with
the Milani supreme cocoa gel pencil nice
packaging if it goes a little past the
waterline that's okay because we're
going to smudge it out anyways go ahead
and just apply it don't think too much
about getting it right directly on the
waterline it's okay if it gets a little
messy I'm gonna go ahead and smudge it
out and now for the mascara this mascara
is revamp tits their colossal spider
effect mascara from Maybelline colossal
was one of my favorite mascaras back in
the day it was such my mascara that
Cesar knew what to pick up for me at the
store if I needed a mascara he's like he
already knows it's the colossal except
it was except it was yellow and purple
for the lashes I'm going to use these
lowly lashes in tease okay so now I'm
going to set my foundation in place I'm
going to be using the maybelline
superstay better skin skin transforming
powder rich tan shade because I just Han
just load up my brush when I put powder
on a brush I like to go ahead and load
it up on every angle and then press it
down so no matter which way you hold it
you're going to get the powder and then
I just like to press it into my skin I
feel like Kendall is always very glowy
and bronzy so I'm glad I tan last night
to add a little bit of bronze to my skin
I'm going to take this bronze booster
from Physicians Formula
it's the globe boosting two-in-one
bronze in highlight and start to work
that on my cheek bone okay for the blush
I'm going to take the Milani baked blush
in Luminoso
it's just a really pretty peach shade
that is looks really nice on all skin
types and then for the highlight I want
to add a little bit of a bronzey low so
for that I'm going to take this one wild
to reflect shimmer
it also says sand right here but I'm
gonna take this and highlight my
cheekbones the lips are are really nice
I love the lip color shoes is because
she's always super nudie if you're
wondering why my lips turn colors is
just because I put like five different
shades on and realized they did not work
as a nude on my new skin tone right now
magic this has a base this is the pink
sugar from wet and wild if you have tan
skin this is gonna look really really
pretty on you and then I'm going to take
the Maybelline vivid matte liquid lip
and nude thrill right on top of it thank
