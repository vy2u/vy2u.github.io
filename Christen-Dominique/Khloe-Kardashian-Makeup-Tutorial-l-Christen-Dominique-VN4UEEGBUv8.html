welcome back to my channel so today I'm
doing a celebrity inspired look which
are always really fun to do and today is
look it's going to be Khloe Kardashian's
cosmopolitan magazine cover I think it's
very glowing and dewy just super
beautiful so I wanted to recreate that
for you guys so if you want to learn how
to get this look then keep watching I'm
going to start off with evening out my
skin tone so for this I'm using my
Smashbox Studios skin and applying it
with my favorite thing to apply my
foundation with which is the Beauty
Blender I feel like it gives you that
natural flawless look and for concealer
this is no surprise to you guys it's the
Naked skin concealer from urban decay
I'm just going to cover up any dark
circles in any uneven darkness that I
have going on and then blend it out with
my finger for a natural finish
I just finished my foundation and
concealer I'm going to go off camera and
do my brows I'll be right back for the
eyeshadow so for my eyeshadow today I'm
going to use the crown pure exposed eyes
shadow palette it comes with 12 super
pigmented versatile blendable and
long-lasting as shadows the first color
I'm using is number 17 this guy is going
to go on the outer part of the lid all
the way up into the crease and it's
going to give this subtle depth it's
going to look really natural and very
pretty I'm going to take number 18 and
focus this really close to the lash line
and work it upwards and this is going to
stay right on the outer part of the eye
and we're going to go all the way up to
the crease but don't go past the first
color you want to make sure that first
color is still peeking through
now we're just going to soften up the
edges so that there's no harsh lines and
everything looks nice and smooth but the
inner corners I'm going to take number
14 which is this glowing gold color and
I'm going to put it right on the inner
part of the lid
did I say inner corners and inner
corners and I'm going to meet it with
the brown and just sweep it back and
forth for the lower lash line I'm going
to go back into the color we use first
that's that number 17 now we're going to
go ahead and highlight the brow bone and
to do this I'm going to take number 13
which has like a yellow undertone to it
and I'm going to highlight my brow bone
with a crown concealer brush and I'm
just going to work it right underneath
the brow and it also kind of cleans up
your brow if you need to do that and
then just blend it downwards into the
other colors I'm going to take the
pencil me in i AK cent pencil in the
color snow and I'm going to line up my
waterline just to make my eyes look
bigger and brighter and Chloe's look was
all about the lashes no liner so this is
going to just accentuate our lashes and
make our eyes look bright for mascara
I'm going to use the benefit roller lash
mascara I've been playing around with
this it's really really good it's way
better than the other benefit mascara
that everybody loved this one beats it
so bad and so I'm going to put this on
off-camera and I'm going to show you the
lashes I'm going to use and also going
to do that off-camera the lashes I'm
using I'm using two one of them are from
SL miss glam beauty and they look like
this I'm going to mix my think these are
my foxy locks ones I'm reusing them also
you want to make sure to load up the
mascara on your bottom lashes you want
them to be really defined and dramatic I
just wanted to show you guys why I love
this mascara look at how it lengthens
and separates the only thing about it is
it always feels wet throughout the day
for some reason but it looks so nice
so just finished putting all my lashes
and they're just big dramatic lashes
that she had on the cover so now I'm
going to steal my foundation for powder
I'm going to use the Urban Decay Naked
skin powder I'm just going to take my
big fluffy brush to apply it before my
under eyes and want them to be a little
bit brighter and kind of highlight my
face so I'm going to take the manic Adar
powder in c3 this is warm yellow for the
bronzer I'm going to use the pixi by
petra face bronze I'm just going to take
some of this and pop it on to the
cheekbone
I'm going to take my mary-lou manizer
and highlight my nose and the high
points of my face so right above the
cheekbone I'm going to flip the brush
around to the clean side and then
feather out the edges
they accentuate the shape of my nose I'm
going to highlight the tip and then
right where the bridges and then I'm
going to take it right on the Cupid's
bow she has a glossy nude lip but I
wanted to find my lips and make them
fuller because she does have fuller lips
than me and it just looks way better
anyways so I'm going to flying them up
with the cappuccino from crown
now I just started putting on the lip
color without telling you guys this is
color pops lippy stick and cookie and
it's a matte shade I'm going to just
layer it right on top of the liner it
would be cool if it actually smelled
like cookies or maybe I'm just hungry
and then for that wet lip look I'm going
to use the glazed lip paint from la girl
and allude
and for the blush I'm going to use the
Miami glow blush and this is from the
motives palette and this is the final
look I hope you guys enjoyed the video
