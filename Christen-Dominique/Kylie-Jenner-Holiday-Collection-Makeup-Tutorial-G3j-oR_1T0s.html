makeup inside this is the makeup bag and

really cool eyes shadow palette that
reminds me of ornaments for some reason
and I want to just hang this up on a
tree that I don't have up right now it's
nikolai t i fell in love with this
lipstick when I finish the shadows I was
like okay I liked it when I saw this
color it was love at first sight I was
like oh I have to put this on my lips
right now and it was that dramatic so I
put it on my lips it's kind of drying
out right now which is making me really
sad but I put it on my ill what's going
on here I put it on my teeth because it
was so good I put it on my lips and I
was like okay this is the best holiday
look I have ever seen I really like it I
feel like anybody can wear it if you're
scared of color and you want to
incorporate it into your look this is
perfect smoking out a wing it's really
flattering and very pretty so I know you
guys are going to love this look and if
you want to learn how to get it then
keep watching hey there hey guys welcome
back to my channel hello can you hear me
alright let's get into this tutorial
today so I'm gonna go ahead I already
put on the moisturizer I'm gonna put on
a little bit of this japonesque primer
on my face just so that our foundation
lays down nice and even it fills in all
the little bumps and holes in our face
I'm gonna go in with my Mac foundation
this is Studio Fix fluid
shave tape where are you I'm going to
cover my under-eye circles with some
shape tape and I'm using a light medium
she is ready for war
I'm going to jump into the eye shadow
I'm so excited because we're going to be
using her new palette and here is the
palette at the Chi shadow palette this
is the holiday collection 2016 palak
where's the tears crying are the colors
that are inside of the palette which
look like this there's a format and 5
shimmers I'm gonna be using this one to
start off with I'm going to use that all
over my lid and take a shader brush this
is my morphe m-52 4 I like to use this
whenever I'm using one shade all over my
lid because it gets that light look at
this it's huge and I always like to use
a base like this because it just makes
it easier to blend out the shadows
everything glides on a lot more smoothly
and it also helps with setting any
creams that you have on your lids this
shadow is one of the mount ones and it's
called chestnut of our lids are sets you
can move on to the color I'm going to
start off with this Bobby shade right
here this is sugar cookie and I'm going
to use that on the crease use my morphe
and 5:05 brush to apply that to the
crease working my brush in there tap off
the excess and I'm going to start to
work that right in the crease area
just gonna warm up the crease with this
really pretty blush tone shade I never
have too much fallout with Kylie's
palettes and then after sugar cookie I'm
going to pick up this dark brown shade
I'm going to focus that on the outer
part of the crease to right in the air
I'm actually going to bring it in a
little heavier to create a cat eye
effect it's a very slanted cat eye it
looks a little chunky right now but
we're going to blend it out I'm going to
start to blend that darker Brown out a
little bit softer and then with this
right here this is a Smith 220 it's
gonna clean that line up make it as soft
as possible I haven't decided if I'm
going to work in the blue or the green
yet because I want a pop of color I just
don't know which way I want to go yet
okay I'm going into the greens called
evergreen I'm going to take this green
shadow and I'm going to work that over
the brown I'm gonna work that over the
brown and then fade it up and honestly
I'm just making this up as I go so we'll
see what we come up with at the end of
this tutorial
we're just marrying these two guys
together whether they like it or not
okay so have a little fan brush I'm
going to take sugar cookie with it the
sugar cookie is our transition shade and
that one's going to help us create those
nice gradient effects and it's going to
help your makeup basically look more
like a celebrity makeup I'm going to use
this more feet r44 brush and I'm going
to take that darker shade of brown this
one is called Gingerbread connecting the
lower lash line to that wing like so so
I'm going to take the green I'm going to
work that on to the outer part of the
lower lash line and then I'm going to go
back into the brown it's a lot of back
and forth until you get a really nice
blend I'm actually going to go right
underneath this line with sugar cookies
going to give it a little bit more
I'm going to sweat my brush with some
fix+ I'm going to use winter which is
that blue shade right there and I'm
going to work that on my waterline I
don't know if you're supposed to do this
or not
I'm just doing it we're going to see
what it comes out like we actually could
probably mix it into the lash line a
little bit it's giving it an iridescent
look which I like so we're going to keep
working it very close to the lash
waterline area it's actually giving us
is a really pretty dark turquoise look I
feel like this is a very simple easy
look that I'm coming out with but it's a
really nice way to work in colors if you
are not comfortable with wearing a lot
of color on your eye using it as
eyeliners is like the best way to do it
and for a pop of shimmer I'm going to go
ahead and take the middle shade which is
frosty that's silver color and I will
pop it on to the inner corners of my
eyes so I'm going to take this BH
Cosmetics 118 brush and start to work
that on the inner corners about this
mascara in from Maybelline's is called
the colossal Big Shot colossal mascara I
used to use in the yellow and purple
tube for a very long time it was so much
my staple that Cesar already knew what
to get me if I was running out of
mascara I'm really curious to try out
with the Big Shot colossal supposed to
be like and they just keep making it
better and better they had this spider
effect one which was okay to me this one
is what was the one that I really like
so I've been on some lashes from House
of lashes and they're actually in the
wrong boxes this is the iconic box which
is the wrong box because the lashes look
like this I think these are the
heartbreaker lashes they're very light
and wispy so I'm going to go ahead and
put this on my eyes and I will be right
back it bugs me if my skin is showing on
my lash line so what I'm doing is taking
the this is one of Kylie's clay pot
liners filling in all the skin when you
do this to a new tight line it makes
your lashes look lush and full so I'm
going to do that to have to look down so
I'm going to be looking this way from
you guys can you see though I'm just
pulling up my lash my eye and filling it
in
so I'm going to go ahead and set my face
I'm going to be using this really
beautiful packaged powder from Pierre
look at that that is gorgeous when I'm
setting my foundation I like to just hat
the powder on so I'm just patting
everything down and then to set my under
eyes I use the shade and light contour
palette okay so I'm going to take this
powder right here in this banana shade
mix them together and then look up and
pass this under my eye this is going to
brighten up your under eyes set all the
cream underneath your eye and after this
your makeup should not budge at all and
then we're going to brighten up around
the mouth you can't go wrong with a Too
Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer so I'm
going to go ahead and take some of this
with my morphe and 500 brush and warm up
my face I always love putting this stuff
on because it smells like chocolate and
then a 4 above the lush I'm gonna keep
this really pretty cute Too Faced love
flush but love flush a blush and
funfetti and this is a cute little baby
pink packaging my favorite color is baby
pink and inside is a cute blush it
actually comes with a two-faced blush
brush too so I'm going to use it for fun
because it's so cute and I'm going to
work it on to my cheekbones just going
to line my lips so I'm going to line my
lips with vixen start out the Cupid's
bow make a sharp V what the heck we're
going to make a bow we're going to make
it a Christmas present today
so I'm gonna put on Blitzen whoo it
smells good
I am in lust with this book right now
and I think I'm going to skip out on the
highlight today just because I'm liking
this matte look with matte lip
