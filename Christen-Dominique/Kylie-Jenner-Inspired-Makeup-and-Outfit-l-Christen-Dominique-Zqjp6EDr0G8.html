so popular Kylie Jenner look it was
requested on my Instagram so I decided
to do it I hope you guys enjoy the video
first I'm going to apply my marrakech
ends to my hair and this is going to
help with my split ends and seriously i
need a haircut because I have so many
split ends if any of you guys have any
haircut suggestions let me know in the
comment I am just working it through my
hair and then brushing it out this is my
all-natural hair frizzy but I
straightened it out so we can look more
like Kylie Jenner and then I took the
healthy sexy hair so you Beach removal
beach spray just to add a bit of texture
to my hair because her hair in the
picture that I'm looking at wasn't super
neat too is kind of messy looking so I'm
just adding a little bit of texture to
my hair
next I'm grabbing my clear clinic spot
treatment to treat a blemish this is
cool because you can put it under over
your makeup then I'm just going to put
it underneath to soften and hydrate my
skin today I am using the lab Alan
jojoba gel cream and to soften my lips
and using the pixie tinted bond and
unique pink this really doesn't have a
color it's just super hydrating so now
for my all-time favorite products right
now it's the bare minerals primetime BB
primer cream and I'm just applying this
before I put my foundation on to fill in
all the fine lines and make my skin look
nice and smooth to even out my skin and
using the cover effects foundation cream
and g---forty now I'm going to put my
concealer on in from honest I'll do in
1.5 and just put that just below my
under eye circles instead of putting
them like or directly on top I'd put it
just below measure in circles and then I
blend it upwards so lets blend it up and
i'm even going to bring it back to the
tops of the cheekbones just going to
brighten up
this area to set my foundation I'm
dusting on the cover FX pressed powder
in G 40 all I'm taking my amana kadar
powder to brighten my under eyes and
basically using this as extra coverage
and a highlight so I'm just going to
take that and put it right under my eyes
bringing it all the way up the tops of
the cheekbones to make sure that our
eyeshadow is smooth we're going to apply
the manic adore eye lip primer to the
lid space using the zoeva naturally
yours Collin I'm picking up the color
first love' and applying it to the brow
bone and lid space for a nice transition
i'm taking the color soft and sexy and
washing this into the crease now I'm
picking up slow-dance and softly
blending this on the outer part of the
crease I took a concealer and I just
applied it around to where I wanted the
shadow to stop and I got my zoeva
concealer buffer brush to blend it out
and soften the edges and it worked
beautifully for me again I don't know if
that's like a professional way to do
things but it worked so you guys
probably should try it
now I'm picking up the Lord and berry
Kajal stick to line my lashline Kylie
has a tiny flick of liner so that's what
I'm going to try to create on the outer
lash line today next I'm using the
Vincent Longo mascara to lengthen my
lashes and make them look fuller
I feel like this mascara does it super
easy because it's a dry formula so it
really holds your curl and you can
really build on it without it clumping
because of the brush is so thin I just I
love it now I'm going to apply some
falsies and these are from Acedo and I
will post them in the description I'm
also going to apply some eyeliner to the
bottom lash line it's okay if it's a bit
messy because we're just going to smudge
it out anyway
for the inner corners I'm going for a
subtle matte highlight and then just
using the color pure from the zoeva
naturally ORS palette and blending that
out to get Kylie's now-famous lip look
I'm using the NYX lip pencil in nude and
I'm going to go over my natural lip line
and fill in my lips to get those nice
full lips that she has to fill in the
lips I'm using Zurich it's a NYX soft
matte lip cream and I'm going to apply
that all over the lips and then I went
and put on the color James I don't
really know if it made a difference but
I like both of the colors I couldn't
decide so I use them both they're both
soft matte lip creams and this it just
created a really natural beautiful pouty
look and it may look like I got lip
injections but hey who cares it looks
good right now I am putting on the
bronzer and I'm going to apply it to the
hollow areas of my cheeks and my temples
and sides of my nose
next time using the city color spotlight
highlighter to get the Kardashian glow
I'm going to apply it on the bridge of
my nose and the tops of my cheekbones
for the cheeks I'm picking up this dusty
rose colors from the city color palette
and applying that to my cheekbones so at
this point in my life I'm kind of
obsessed with highlighting my under eyes
and tops of my cheeks so I took the
booboo cover-up and applied it over
everything else I already have to really
brighten up the under eyes and here I'm
taking the model's own nail polish and
adding an accent nail this is the final
look I hope you guys enjoyed the video
subscribe for more thumbs up and until
the next video bye dollies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
