today I'm super super excited because we
are gonna be revealing the lemonade
collection we're doing swatches and I'm
showing you how I got this look we're
going into all the details I just want
to quickly thank you guys for all the
love and support for the latte palette
it is doing so grave or in Ulta stores
now we're five-star rated on Ulta calm
Beauty Bay Influenster everywhere it's
really crazy to me and I'm so happy that
it's done so well and that you guys love
it even people that don't know who I am
love it and they're giving it good
reviews so that lets me know that you
guys really love the product if you
haven't tried it go into an Ulta or on
my website domine cosmetics pick it up
and try it for yourself see what all the
hype is about now we're gonna get into
the lemonade palette and the lip glosses
the whole collection so I'm gonna start
with the glosses there are four glosses
they look like so they have lemonade
right here in gold the DC on the top and
a pink little cap this is the box that
it comes in it's this pink and yellow
water color with gold details this one
right here is the strawberry lemonade
it's a vibrant pink it's so pretty on
its own you don't even need a lip liner
with this one it just naturally enhances
your lip and just look so summery like
that natural just fitten kind of lip and
then this one right here which is the
pale pink this one is called pink
lemonade and I love wearing this with a
brown liner or something more Mabi
and then we have peach tea and this
orange e brown shade is sweet tea and
you'll notice that they're the same name
as the colors in the palette so they
were very much inspired by some of the
shades in the palette what I love about
these most is that they're super
hydrating you're gonna instantly notice
that your lips are so much softer after
you put this on I don't like when my
glosses stick together and you can kind
of see it separating on the lip I think
it's uncomfortable and I just don't like
the way it looks so I made sure that
these are not sticky at all I love these
guys I know you're gonna love them too
so now I'm gonna get into the palette
the gold this is the palette it is a
gold sleeve the outside texture of the
sleeve is similar to a lemon peel it's
so cool and pretty she is so beautiful
she's a water color pink and yellow with
the lemonade in golds you open up the
palette and there's ten
the first color is lemon soda it is
extremely soft and buttery and smooth I
love that you can just pop it on the
inner corners on the lid the entire lid
the brow bone this one is super vibrant
so I wouldn't use it as a highlight on
myself you can play around with it
because like a full face brush will fit
in these pants right next to it we have
pink lemonade which is a bubblegum pink
with a gold shift so depending on where
the light hits you'll see bubblegum
bright pink or you'll see this gold as
you can see as I'm moving my hand kind
of almost looks rose gold then we have
new tea which is a warm peach with a
matte finish it is extremely pigmented
you can use this on your brow bone to
set your eyelids you can actually use it
on your face as well because again these
pans are super large and it's just an
essential color that I feel like
everybody's going to love then we have
peach which is a warm peach foil
cucumber is a cool tone mint green foil
mango is a warm yellow mustard oh my god
these are so soft like baby soft and we
have sweet tea which is a super vibrant
warm orange Brown chai tea is a plummy
brown with cool undertones very creamy
all three of these matte shades you can
put all over your lid you can work it
into the crease add drama with this one
use them as liners if you wet your brush
or put some fix+ on it any of these
shades in the palette will easily glide
across your eye to create a wing then we
have strawberry which is a dark pink
with silver flecks and I consider this a
shimmer oil because it has a lot of
those silver flecks in it but it will
glide across the skin just like a foil
the last color in the palette is
blueberry fizz and this is a blueish
purple with violet and blue flecks so I
like to call this one a straight-up
shimmer I mean it could be a foil but I
feel like this is more of a shimmer just
because I spent so much time on choosing
the right color flecks and I put so many
different color flecks so it has a
really nice dimension you can layer this
over chai tea and that looks really
really pretty
strawberry you can layer over mango
or even use on your inner corners
cucumber with mango is really cute peach
and sweet tea look amazing together
lemon soda layered over mango pink
lemonade layered over anything and this
palette looks so good just because it
has that really pretty gold rose gold
kind of shift to it also new tea is just
an essential that you need on your eye
essential for setting the eyes popping
that brow bone arch out with any palate
that I've created so far you can use at
least one shade for your face so watch
out for that if you get the palette
don't think that you just have to use it
on your eyes you can use it on your face
do the lemonade collection will be
launching June 19th very very soon and
the palette will be priced at $42 as
usual and the glosses individually are
$17 each I will be having a bundle price
coming up soon make sure you follow
Dominique Cosmetics on Instagram so you
can stay updated
I already did my foundation brows cream
contour we are ready just to focus on
the eyes I'm so excited I've been using
this palette a lot but I haven't done an
actual tutorial with it so the first
color I'm gonna pick up is new tea this
nude peach right here just a really soft
matte color and just so that we can and
make sure that everything is even on the
eye there's no slipping and sliding or
uneven creams going on so I'm just gonna
lightly dust that all over not too much
I'm doing a light layer like this now
I'm gonna move into the crease so for
the crease I'm gonna take sweet tea
which is this super vibrant orange e
Brown kind of shade I'm just gonna pick
this up right here I'm just gonna work
that into the crease I don't want to put
that on my lid because then the entire
look will be super warm in orangie I'm
gonna go into mango mango is basically
the color of my background you can wear
it on its own you can put it all over
the lid just in the crease you can do so
much with mango it's a very summery
color I'm gonna pop into mango which is
a warm yellow mustard color and because
it's matte you can do so much with it
and I'm just gonna layer that right on
top of that orange shade and then I'm
gonna bring it all over the lid I got
the orange shade on this brush so
go into a new brush so we don't mess up
our eye shadow I'm gonna put that all
over the lid and I have a fluffy brush
because I also want to bring it into the
crease lay it right over
sweet tee' and then bring it right above
sweet tea this is one of those shades in
the palette that you can use literally
with every single shimmer matte foil
everything that I have you can use it
with this shade and it would look so so
pretty then I'm gonna go over with a
flat brush like this and intensify mango
a little bit more like right some of
them are a little bit more buttery some
of them have more of a higher coverage a
higher payoff and that's because of the
color formula overall is pretty
consistent with the last very long
lasting blends super easy into the skin
and has a really nice buildable coverage
some of them are just BAM and then
others you can like build up but I
wanted certain colors to be that way
like sweet tea and wanted a very big
punch vibrancy with this color this
palette was made to bring summer and
Happiness into your life it is so
vibrant so beautiful so fun and just go
down on the lower lash line and I made
the match so that you can still create
dimension so I did mango sweet tea that
you can layer chai tea for drama so
those three are the core shades in the
palette and then everything else that's
a foil or shimmer in this palette you
can pop on the center of the lid you can
put in your inner corners you can put it
all over your lid and then chai tea you
can wear a lone pop on blueberry fizz
there's so many looks you can do with
this palette but I can only do one look
in this video I'll have more looks for
you guys coming up soon I wanted the
first look to be super lemon a tea okay
so chai tea is a soft plum II Brown so
I'm gonna pick that up right here and
I'm gonna work that into the crease I'm
gonna pop back into mango and just work
that on the edge of crease and when you
mix those shades together it creates
such a beautiful transition I'm blending
this color up into the brow bone going
up this way I'm gonna pop into chai tea
and just get a little bit going on the
we're lashline okay so now it is time to
layer on the star of the show today
which is lemon soda it's a vibrant
yellow shimmer right here it looks like
this and what I'm gonna do is pop that
on my inner corners another really
pretty look that I was doing with this
palette is using mango all over the lid
up into just before the brow bone and
then popping a lemon soda on top of that
no other colors around it it's so
beautiful you have to try it that and
then a little bit of sweet tea on the
outer corner and the more you layer on
the more intense it gets it's already
pretty nice and vibrance for the inner
corners I could use lemon soda but I
just want to test out what pink lemonade
would look like it's a bubblegum pink
with a gold shift so depending on which
way you turn it will either be pink or
gold when it takes some of chai tea
right here and line up my lash line to
add more definition I'm going to use
this tight angle brush and Pat it on my
lash line where the brow bone I'm gonna
take new teeth and highlight the brow
bone now I'm gonna take a clean brush
and just go over all the edges make sure
everything is nice and soft I'm gonna
take this brown eyeliner in tight line
the top even though I have pink lemonade
on the inner corners I feel like I need
to bring lemon soda down to the lower
lash line I'm just feeling the vibes
right now take it down here pop on some
lashes now I'm gonna take some of the
mascara and put it on the lower lashes
it's so pretty it looks the way it looks
and now that we're done with the eyes
I'm gonna go ahead and do the rest of
the faith and add some concealer under
my eyes like so
I'm gonna set my under eyes with some
powder
now that we've brightened our under eyes
and all the dark spots in our face I'm
just gonna contour just a little cheeks
Nachi
I'm loving this plummy Brown right here
it's so pretty
I'm gonna add a peach blush to the
cheeks kind of go up a little bit on the
temple now I'm just gonna pop on a quick
highlight to the cheekbones or the lips
I'm gonna use this Mac stripped down a
lip liner to line up my lips now that
we've lined our lips I'm gonna pop on a
gloss the gloss that I'm using is sweet
tea this guy right here matches the one
in the palette and I'm just gonna pop it
right on top of the lip liner
