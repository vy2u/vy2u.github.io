today I'm going to be showing you this
super easy very natural holiday kind of
makeup look this is the look that I'm
gonna do when I'm hanging out with my
family eating on the couch watching
Christmas movies waiting to open
presents this is kind of makeup look
that you really do you're just like very
natural if nothing at all even though I
love looking at these glittery red and
green kind of looks I just wanted to do
something that I would actually really
do so this is it very basic natural
glowy skin just in case you have your
family members trying to snap pictures
of you and you're like not noticing at
least your highlight is glowing and
blinding the camera your face looks like
nice and bright and healthy this is that
makeup look it's a realistic holiday
makeup look that's what it is that
should be the title this is actually my
first year that I'm not actually gonna
be with my mom and my family I'm
actually at home I just moved into a new
place we've been trying to settle in for
like a while and so this will be my
first Christmas in LA so if you guys
want to learn how to get this natural
and glowy look for the holidays don't
forget to subscribe to my channel and
hit that notification bell so to be a
part of the quad family and without
further ado let's get on with the video
house and it feels so much bigger if I
could just stretch out everywhere I feel
like there is such a huge difference but
to you guys it looks the same because
you're only seeing this face right here
nothing else but I feel like I can
stretch out to the world for a primer
today I'm gonna take the laura geller
spackle treatment makeup primer and i've
actually never tried this it's still
it's very new so I'm gonna open it up
and try it with you guys some of my hand
and it's like skin tone oh it says even
tone so it's supposed to even
your skin tone and then take that all
around work it all around the face that
definitely feels like it's going to hold
the foundation on my face like it feels
a little sticky like if is I wouldn't
say sticky it feels a little tacky on
the skin so it makes me feel like it's
gonna hold the foundation better
throughout the night I don't know what
you guys but whenever I am hanging out
with the fam on the holidays I really
don't care what my face looks like I
just I want my skin to look good
I want my brows to be on point lashes
but that's it I don't really care for
anything else I do want to have that
glowy kind of look so that's what I'm
gonna be doing today so I'm gonna just
pop that primer on and then I'm gonna go
into this foundation from YSL this is
the all ours foundation something that's
gonna be full coverage long last scheme
I just basically want my skin to look
even no blemishes clear bright glowy and
healthy and then while that dries I'm
gonna go ahead into my brows and
literally this is how my hair was for
Thanksgiving my hair is just like this
the whole time I really could care less
cuz we're with the family we're with
Grandma we're with mom sister nobody
really cares
I'm gonna go ahead and jump right into
my eyeshadow so I'm gonna be using the
new it's my ray ray x bh cosmetics
eyeshadow palette there are so many
really pretty just wearable colors right
here
you don't even has a mirror it's like
everything in one palette that's so cool
I'm gonna go ahead and take pancake and
mix it in with mousse and start to work
that right into the crease something
that is just gonna give us a natural
definition right here and I'm just gonna
wash the color on just to give us some
depth right in the crease area so it's
gonna follow right underneath the brow
bone this is just something that you can
do really quick I'm gonna take control
freak right underneath it who's more of
a red tone Brown so washing that right
onto the bottom of those two colors this
eye shadow is really pigmented because
I'm barely tapping my brush in there
he's picking up a lot of product but it
blends really nicely so I love that now
I want a very natural just glowy eye so
I'm gonna take nudists right here I'm
gonna use this brush right here I like
it cuz it's flat fluffy and it kind of
takes up I can feel like it's gonna take
up a lot of my lid space so that's a
good thing I'm gonna take nudists and
just pop it right onto the lid oh I like
this color and it's okay if it kind of
lays over the other shades because it's
just going to make it look that much
more natural and bright I just want to
look like I have a nice awake healthy
bright naturally contoured eye it's
gonna look like we basically did nothing
to our eyes but if you see the before
and after in my face I don't know if I
could do it right now but if I can show
you the before and after it's a drastic
difference it just looks like a
healthier prettier looking eyelid so
with that said I'm gonna go ahead and
add a little bit of brown liner to my
lash line I'm gonna take my pencil brush
from makeup shock this is a tee at 13
and I'm gonna grab the midnight
and just run it right along the base of
your lashes because we're gonna put
lashes on and you want it to look
seamless and I don't want like a perfect
wing so I'm just gonna diffuse that edge
oh now I'm gonna go into the lower lash
line I'm gonna bump my brush in to spice
and just work that that's actually a
little too red for me my bad
just kidding I'm gonna take mousse in
pancake and work that on the lower lash
line as well and since we already have
spice right there I'm just gonna grab a
tad fit so it doesn't look uneven and
then go back into mousse and pancake I
love these names just gonna take some of
what I have there and pop it back into
the socket of my eye because it kind of
changed up with the spice but I think I
kind of like it so I'm gonna keep going
with that glowy kind of look on the eyes
I'm gonna take my all-time favorite from
Victoria Beckham the Estee Lauder
mascara the only thing is it gets kind
of clumpy so that's not really problem I
have with this mascara but I really like
the way it just grabs on to every lash
and it pulls it out and Bluffs it up at
the same time so I'm gonna pop this on
my lower lashes first and then I'm gonna
pop on some eyelashes I feel like it's
been so long since I've done a makeup
tutorial um because of the move and
everything so I feel like I'm I'm
forgetting words oh my gosh the lashes
I'm using are from Bellamy they're a
collab with douve I'm not really heard
of they are the hashtag douve ex-ored of
X Bellamy and they are just the
prettiest natural looking wispy fluffy
lash I have been waiting to use these
lashes actually I'm like I want to do
really natural just skin lashes like
natural lashes but flirty kind of
looking these are perfect for this look
then for the inner corners of my eyes
I'm going to take the L'Oreal True Match
Lumi shimmery stes this one's moonlight
then this one is sunlight I'm gonna mix
them together to highlight the inner
corners of my eyes and then I'm gonna
also swatch them for you guys on my hand
so you can see this one is moonlight and
this one is sunlight that is pretty and
then I'm trying to mix them in the
middle together because I used it
earlier and it was just the most
beautiful combination and in the inner
corners to give us that glow so I'm
taking sunlight and popping that right
on the center of the lid just so that
when the light hits it'll reflect this
really pretty light it just makes your
eyes look super glowy and just pretty
and now I'm gonna move on to my
under-eye circles which aren't that bad
today so I'm gonna go ahead but I'm
still gonna use my concealer I'm gonna
try a new concealer though cuz this was
a new one from Kylie and I've been
really excited to try this on my face
this is the shade ivory work it oh it's
very thin super thin thin and
lightweight feeling on the skin which is
not bad
I love how it just glides on the skin
and it looks like it's gonna be full
coverage even though it feels really
light do myself a little facelift the
cheekbone and I feel like this is a nice
bronzy kind of a color and I'm gonna
keep it right on the cheeks
I actually like the coverage on this I
just think that blending it out is a
little tricky like you can't let it sit
too long then it's gonna be a little bit
tougher to blend but I like the coverage
I like that it's super thin and you
really don't need that much to get the
cut like a lot of coverage and then I'm
gonna go ahead and take the mocha from
the palette to contour through this
shade right here in the middle and kind
of turn out of my nose sort of turns
down a little bit so fake it and pretend
like we have a turned-up nose I take
this blush right here from the balm
looks like so this is really cute
packaging by the way I'm gonna pop that
on my cheeks just to give myself like a
nice natural flush of color and keep
that right on the apples of the cheeks I
want to have that look like I just
pinched like somebody pinched your
cheeks and then just let them go very
like natural pinky and then I'm gonna
put some of the pink right on this area
I don't know why I just love the way
pink looks right here just brightens it
up in a really pretty way for this look
is Maj it's one of the most important
parts of this look because I want to
look glowy AF on the holidays so I'm
gonna take my highlighting brush the
t-38 from makeup shock I'm gonna take
the L'Oreal True Match Lumi shimmery
stand sunlight and this gives you it
looks like it's gonna be like a crazy
shimmer on your cheeks but it gives you
a really nice soft it's so beautiful I
love this highlight it gives you a
really nice soft glow so I'm gonna take
moonlight and use that on the highest
point of my cheek
here so I'm kind of like layering these
two guys together I'm also gonna put it
right on the temples take some on my
Cupid's bow for the lips I'm gonna stay
pretty neutral so I'm gonna try first
I'm gonna try this Laura Mercier the
lower extreme matte lipstick and fresh
Wow boba it actually has excitement in
her blood tonight
she's playing with the box she's running
around like crazy she's usually like
laid out on the floor somewhere in a
corner
and I just want to have like the most
natural-looking lip but I do want to add
some definition so I'm gonna bring this
in a little bit more this is actually a
really pretty natural color and I'm kind
of pushing the color around just so that
it gives you a kind of like a stained
look now I'm gonna take the huda beauty
lip strobe in the shade posh and this is
totally optional but I just want to add
a little bit of a shine in the center
that's actually a lot of shine and it
takes them off it's also it's gonna just
give your lips a little bit more
dimension it's not gonna look so flat
but I think alone the fresh shade looks
really pretty I just want that extra
glow all over my face thank you guys for
watching I hope you enjoyed this video
