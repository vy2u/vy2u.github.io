is 2018 we are living in 2018 now can
you believe that years just go by so
fast but I wanted to start this video
off with just me barefaced do my makeup
with you guys but this video isn't much
about makeup it's more just about
reflecting back on 2017 and talking to
you guys and just my plans for what's
coming up this year and just a little
heart to heart so I decided to do things
a little different this time and start
with no makeup at all not even the brows
I am bald right now I was like this is
not gonna be about makeup and then I'm
gonna start talking about makeup I
already know myself so I'm gonna start
off with primer I'm using the Smashbox
one the one it's supposed to help with
dark spots so I'm just gonna focus that
under my eyes but looking back on 2017 I
had some really memorable moments and I
definitely grew as a person each year
you learn something new about yourself
and you grow and you do better sure last
year I learned a few things I'm going to
use the professional pearl primer it's a
new primer from benefit I haven't really
tried it until right now but it has like
a soft pink look to it I'm gonna put
that on my nose I'm also gonna put it
like right in here and right in the
middle of my forehead did some fun
collaborations on my channel with some
friends that I got a little bit closer
to this year I'm not somebody that
actually opens up to everybody so to
open up to someone is really big for me
I'm just a very private person in that
way especially with my family and stuff
like that so opening up to people was a
huge thing for me last year and how to
grab a coffee wait I said you were the
good kind of fat this is my favorite
coffee mug the perfect amount of coffee
and at the same time it's just my
favorite things in life are on this cup
this is my first time that I did my
brows with the just powder and not a
pencil I love how they just came out
anyways I am mixing latte and almond
together be a tan this weekend and my
body is a completely different color
than my face
so we are going to mix these two guys
together and you really don't need much
of this foundation because it covers
your whole entire face with just one
drop do you see the coverage basically
creating a new layer of skin on my face
and I kind of love it
like I was saying I'm keep things to
myself and my family so to open up just
just somebody friend wise is it's pretty
huge for me so I did that got let down
and I just want to let you guys know
that if you ever open up to somebody and
you feel like you shouldn't have done
that
don't let that messed up your
relationships after that incident
because you can be missing out on some
amazing people after that happened I
didn't let that situation affect me in a
negative way I opened up to some amazing
people and I've met some super
motivating selfless kind-hearted people
and I'm very very happy and who have
gotten close to this year or last year
and I've even done some collaborations
on my channel last year I did one with
Sylvia Ghani Chloe Morello Karen I was
so huge I love her so much
Krispy and Jake he's such a cute little
thing
I didn't let with that situation you
know change who I was I really just you
know you're a little bit more cautious
but don't let situations like that
completely ruin future relationships
that can be amazing when we went to
Necker Island with benefit I was Richard
Branson's private island and we had the
whole island to ourselves ooh that was
that was pretty epic we went on to Korea
with Arab Orion which is a skincare
brand I have my most favorite BB cream
in the world and we went to Big Bear I
saw snow for the first time with my
family I went to the ariana grande
concert with my dear friend heart that's
someone that I have known since I moved
here we clicked and we just stayed
friends through the entire time and the
most genuine down-to-earth kind soul I
love her with all my heart we always say
to each other every time we we leave
each other it's like we never left
obviously won't communicate their
Instagram but actually see each other
because we're always so busy
it's like we never left so I love her
her and aunt I love him so so much and
they've been the same since I met them
and they're amazing and then I went to
France twice I went to can't Cannes
Cannes oh my god I'm gonna get
somebody's gonna say something about the
way I'm saying that I got a tummy tuck
this year completely changed my
confidence in my body because as you
guys know I'm a mom and you have a baby
I'm telling you it does things no matter
what you do working out cannot change it
so I got rid of my stretch marks and my
extra skin and I felt so good afterwards
and went to Mexico and I christed a
picture in a bikini like stand in front
of you in a bikini in front of anyone
like I wouldn't care and that's
something that I couldn't do before so
that was really huge for me last year
super huge big thanks to dr. Barrett I
went on a trip with my mom this year
which was so cool Tarte invited
influencers and their mothers to come
along with them to kind of get the whole
feel of what a trip is like like an
influencer trip is life they got the
makeup they got everything that we would
get and it was so amazing my mom is like
in heaven she has so many heart-shaped
cake concealers she's good for life like
she's by the way this foundation is so
full coverage you don't even need
concealer it is covering my entire life
secrets right now I just if they're gone
I don't even know where they went
so I'm gonna go into my eyes I'm gonna
use my friend my friend Patrick came out
with his own collaboration with Matt oh
so freaking amazing
and I have the box here still isn't this
crazy this is the most beautiful package
I've ever seen from a brand it's so cool
and the inside its I already took
everything out because I've already used
to stuff a bunch of times but this is
the inside and there goes this pretty
face so amazing things have happened for
my friends as well this year so I'm
gonna be using his eyeshadow palette
this is actually like using both of them
this is glam AF and then this one is
gold gutter I'm going to start off by
using the
shade right here just to even out the
lid you want to surround yourself with
people that going after their dreams and
pushing you and themselves and just
people around that I take this shade
right here from goal gutter and I also
take this shade down here from glam ETF
mix them together in my crease to give
us some duck boba is laid out like slat
like a rug and right in front of me it's
so cute I got a really cool opportunity
to collaborate with a brand I was very
excited about finally a brand that I
really wanted to collaborate with that I
really loved but it just couldn't happen
because my brand was coming out to this
month which I'm gonna update you guys
more on in just a bit and now I'm taking
this brown color right here from the
gold gutter palette I think this year I
really got to connect with my uncle that
I have never really had a chance to do
that with because he's always lived out
of the country on the country sometimes
out of the country
out of this state but once I moved to LA
he lived in California now he's in
Mexico but we still get to talking to
Munich eight and that way and we're just
so much closer now we went to visit him
this year and his family and she's been
down here a bunch of times and I just
can't even explain to you how amazing it
is to have I'm getting emotional right
now so weird it's cool to finally
connect with him it was just nice to
have to get close to him and they'll be
moving soon this year so that is
something I'm very excited about all of
my family is in Houston my mom and
grandma my other uncles everybody's in
Houston so it's nice to have someone out
here that is family I mean of course my
son my husband but it's cool to have
other people too one person that I
always went to this year that was my
neighbor who's Patrick he was he's
always like been there for every
accomplishment and birthday to give me
flowers or something just just to be a
friend and I love him for that I
probably don't post about a lot of this
stuff I keep my personal life and I
don't make it public I just want to
enjoy it so you guys probably don't see
everyone who I hang out with I mean I
wish I was a little bit more open in
that aspect but I think it's just a part
of who I am it would be nice to kind of
work on that this year but I decided not
to make a new year's resolution to
myself so I decided for myself it
doesn't probably works for you guys but
it does not work for me so if you're
anything like me if I have a goal I'm
just gonna try to work harder towards it
I don't want to say it I'm just gonna do
it I'm gonna show myself better than I
can tell myself I took my first picture
with my son last year in a very long
time because I didn't put my son on any
of my social medias I actually when I
first started I put him on quite a bit
I'm gonna be using these the darkest
shades in both palettes now he is a huge
motivation and I want to be a role model
for him I am Ola model for him and his
basically his life coach so I want to be
the best that I can be so I can show him
that he can do the same so actually
Jaden's gonna be 10 this month which is
exciting a lot of exciting things
happening this month my brand is
launching this month finally I have been
teasing it to you guys sneak peeking it
to you guys for a while cuz it's so
exciting I just wanted to get it out
there like but I decided not to do that
until it is very close and it is very
close so it's coming up towards the end
of the month I will be launching domini
cosmetics which is my only cosmetic line
that I'm creating a passion project for
me so I'm nerv sighted I think that's
the best way to explain it it's all of
that in one thing we've worked so hard
on the formula and getting it right and
the colors and the names and ready to
make this brand a success and to get it
out to you guys and for you guys to
enjoy it bring it into your life and
make it a part of your daily routine as
well you guys know I love coffee it's
right here I every day every night it's
really bad actually it's a very
important part of my day benefit held a
brow search and I was a coach it was for
Coach earth who was me Amanda and seeing
Patrick's
and James Charles and it was the funnest
trip it was so beautiful there on Lake
Tahoe it made me want to go back and
have Christmas but you know we were
moving through Christmas so that didn't
happen
we actually had Christmas for the first
time here but we were moving and working
and moving and trying to get all the
equipment in here and I know you guys
see just this background but there's
just like so much around me above me and
beside me below me I wonder if he could
see in my eye my people like that that
Cesar lighting my entire face he's so
good I'm so thankful for him Mozza just
mentioned me moved but we moved into a
house like our first I never thought I
was gonna be able to move into a house
in LA I remember moving here and I moved
into a one-bedroom and I stayed in this
same apartment complex second year I was
in a two-bedroom the Nok zeroes in third
three-bedroom and then we moved to this
other place every year I've done better
with my channel and now we're in a house
which is amazing the house I'm running
but it's a house you know and hopefully
praying to God I do that once we have
launched his brand I am able to actually
customize my own house and but for now
we have this really beautiful cozy home
and a large space to work in
I have so much space to work out in it's
not even funny I am now doing so many
different workouts because of the space
that I have it's so amazing I've been
doing Blogilates every day every morning
I fellow her workouts and I also just
started doing hip hop dance workout so
much fun to do the dance but Innis
workouts you know if you guys want to
start doing it or want to know it was
somebody to follow I think it's a fire
marshal and Blogilates to tone up you
can actually do the moves you know
they're not like too complicated you
will sweat like my whole face is beet
red by the time I'm done like I feel
like I've just worked out at a gym and
I'm just using my own body weight now
I'm gonna add actually I saw this
beautiful palette from Tarte it's this
one right here I'm gonna take this shade
right here and pop it on to my inner
third I feel like I summed up everything
that I went through this year so quick
it all came out at one
no I don't know what I wasn't talking
about I'm gonna use the Patrick's powder
and lastly for the lips this is the
combo that I've been loving lately and
I'm not just using it because this is
literally my favorite combo just saying
that because it's my friends products
I like the mahogany from the Patrick
Starr collection as the liner so I'll
line my lips first and then I'm gonna
take she better work lipstick and then I
mixed in more mahogany on the outer
corners and then I take my eye lips out
IX color pop the lip gloss and I stole
it and it is such a beautiful gloss it's
a pink with the gold flecks in it put it
in the Sun and just twist around it is
so gorgeous and I put that right on the
center of my lips so you get that golden
shine but it has a little bit of the
pink it's glossy I love it and that's it
that is the completed look and that is
the end of my chitchat talk with you
guys oh my gosh I can't believe I almost
forgot to say this one other thing that
happened last year was we created the
quad family which every flake all the
new subscribers that I get I always have
that question what is the quad family
when did this come about what does that
even mean this is not your quad I know
that I know all of that quad a family
got started and I'm gonna say this only
once in this video we created the quad
family last year I wanted to start a
notification squad when I first
announced that was like don't forget to
click the Bell to be a part of a
notification squad I accidentally said
notification quad because I mean the
best speaker ever and I meant to say
squad and then I was like I made a joke
about it being like four of us and you
guys kind of went with it and liked it
and kept bringing it up and saying quad
so I was like you know what I'm just
gonna call it the quad family so I was
seeing quad family for a while but
together we are stronger and that's what
I was thinking in my head putting it all
together its quad family but it means
together we're strong and that's how I
got started that was it I hope you guys
that didn't know now you know the whole
meaning behind the quad
family and I love them the Clark family
is actually very strong and they're very
proud and I honestly think we need some
t-shirts but pretty much at the end of
the video thank you guys for watching I
hope you have an amazing year don't
forget to go after your dreams don't let
anything stop you learn everything you
want to know about what you want to do
so you can put your all into it and
don't just have it we keep it pg-13 here
on this channel so don't forget to hit
that notification bell to be a part of
the quad family until the next video bye
