we're using a oil okay so now we're
gonna need some contour right yes
perfect oh my god okay this is my
contour that I always use so for our
brows I'm just gonna give you this
benefit brow pencil okay so now we're
choosing an eyeshadow palette we need
okay and then okay we need lashes so go
ahead and pick lashes you have these
okay so we're choosing those and then
what's next
we need bronzer or blush so tart has a
lot of them so we'll go in here so that
and then we're gonna choose a highlight
so you can choose any one of those
highlights pillow-talk okay cool so we
have the highlight let's go put those
down what do we need next okay so get a
lip so a lip and that's it we're going
bold today alright so now we're gonna go
and do the makeup are you ready what are
you gonna use first I'm going is there
with with the ice we're gonna be using
latte palette that's it little brush you
have to show them what you're using baby
person I guess we'll start it like it
okay oh I see you're like really
focusing on the crease I feel it there's
four huge brush holders right on the
side so he can choose from any brush he
wants okay this one's gonna be under
like more to the side to bring more of a
darker color okay okay kind of like
where we're going tomorrow yeah so when
you guys are watching this will probably
be in the Bahamas yeah we're taking a
family trip I think I just need to add
some we're a little bit here because
here it's lip syncs on I'm just making
sure that it's all filled in yeah okay
check that out
yeah I think it just needs to clean up
the middle
good that's it for the ice oh yeah okay
so now if you're done with the eyes
completely then you gotta clean up the
craziness so it's a vector your wipes to
get stuff up after that we should be
back keeping it's clean
a little bit on the sides a little bit
on the sides like that yeah there we go
I think now we got good so no but what
about this look look at that
okay now clean up that part too okay if
you think it's prettier art then I'll
keep it no I just think we should take
this part too cuz it's going over the
other part good oh the highlight that I
put on there well this for different
kind of look because I don't normally
put highlight there that's different
okay so next rice what you do foundation
so that's gonna be here this is the e
x11 foundation yeah that's our
foundation that will be easy
there's a lot here for somehow Jaden do
you remember doing this before this is
like the new upgraded version obviously
I'm better okay this obviously you see
I'm doing I don't have the niqab drove
it up last time Jaden did this was when
he was four years old or four or five
I'm gonna link the video below so you
guys can check out compare them and see
how good he's gotten since then with the
makeup
yeah now let's cover those under-eye
circles oh okay so grab the concealer
okay you can put some in here and just
pick it up what why are you laughing
this is a little harder probably because
you're using the big side excites for
your face and the smalls for this okay I
wanna look flawless Jaden I'm doing it
it's it's the we already did the eyes
and they look flawless I agree
you know why they made this little
pointy part so you can get into the
inner corners okay you see how easy that
is now okay okay so you don't want to
blend in my concealer that's what I'm
getting at because mommy looks flawless
yes still we're working on it all the
edges of my foundation and my concealer
are they blended yes okay do my brows
cuz I feel like I have no brows mm-hmm
this is my problem with my brows I feel
like I don't have enough brow I want him
to look fuller but not crazy big like
well this big but I wanted to be fuller
and a little cuz they're shorter so make
them a little longer can you do that
okay
am I going in there Elle's Jaden give me
a tip I'm gonna give you a little tip
for the day it's just like color so just
have to dab it you press and you move it
around you guys don't know this about
Jaden or if you follow me on snap and
you've heard me talk about this before
Jaden has been building this city of his
called ty city he's been trying to build
oh what he's been building it for how
many years like four yeah four years he
has passports street signs all over the
house I've shown this in other videos
before alright so you did my brows does
it look like how mommy normally does her
brows yes all right so what are we doing
next
Chiti lashes he picked the house of
lashes in Ellora light feel like maybe
you can put them on without the glue so
it just tries to come on see what
happens you know still oh it's getting
better
where are you putting them not bad okay
so do the other one
Wow Jayden good job
the choppa will always have you really
want to use this cutter you want to make
it for baking not baking cookies but
baking mommy's face I can ask you for a
favor before I go on can you please
blend in my concealer OAC a blending
it's kind of right you see it and then
now there's like a little edge on the
side right there and you know what helps
if you turn it over get going
ah okay the next one I'm just gonna
blend my foundation of it now there at
all I think I'm making it worse
I think you're better than me Jaden I
had a good Furman and he said just sing
it I'm just gonna do this and then I
promise I won't touch anything else
okay now we're blended so now you're
gonna bake so you put this inside the
powder yeah
so you bake and you let it sit okay for
a little bit and then you wipe it off oh
yeah this is the fun part
not bad Jayden okay let's move on to
bronzer
oh wait contour contouring is like like
creating a face pretend like you're just
oh okay Oh higher cheekbones do another
one it's an outline basically creating
an outline of a really nice cheekbone no
no my forehead our camera cut off for a
little bit so I don't know if you got
this nose contour right here but he was
inspired by an airplane so he created
three lines one over here one in the
middle and one on the side so now we're
gonna blend it in with a Beauty Blender
I see how it's kind of just making
everything mm-hmm what's supposed to
make everything look smaller this one
this one oh wow it's blending in pretty
good okay blending the rest good job
you're doing a good job with blending
this one cuz this one's kind of hard to
blend in okay so we're good we have a
skinny looking face higher cheekbones I
like it my nose is smaller I like that
too okay so we have bronzer here and we
have blush highlight and then lips so
you can choose the next day live so yeah
yeah I'm really excited about doing like
okay this is our lips from rimmel rimmel
what's the color like a red rosette Oleg
Waddell
yeah we're good we're good
I feel like it's Christmas on my face
okay so you need bronzer so we can go at
the trouble okay so oh this is even
tropical oh yeah getting with our look
little brush use a little bit yes so we
can get the little part so good what
little party do you want to do right in
between my brows okay on the side of my
face yeah you have looking pale it's
looking really pal okay well you bronze
it up with that little brush it might
take two years but we'll be done they do
it for the 100 hours later someone got
these upgrades oh yeah okay here we go
I think it would be faster with the
blend okay alright cuz it blends more
okay okay okay okay now we're doing the
other side oh wow I just saw the mist it
makes this yeah that's that's the only
place you thought I needed a bronze
that's it right
everywhere else is fine yeah so we're
doing blush we're gonna go here no the
blush is this one remember swirling is
going in Rees going in okay know where
we put it on the cheeks like Santa Claus
you know I use rosy cheek oh the cheeks
right here no whatever you want oh I get
it like the cheeks that make it red
mm-hmm
okay so right now we're gonna do the
other side right here yes we can make it
more to my face
yeah yeah that's it we're almost done we
just need some highlight now it's two
sides it's either this side or this side
if you can just highlight my face at
some point oh
that you're stabbing my heart ok very
good
where do you think the light would hit
my face it's always the side that's
gonna make it look bigger again lighter
colors do darker colors make you look
smaller
oh no so where do we want to make it
look bigger
Jaden wants the side of my face big in
this only this side I am gonna be so
glowy
my forehead is ever'body
I think it needs a little ending area no
this is the tropical look is this Thai
city tropical look yeah that's the thing
over there this will probably be our
last and final okay thing for the face
so what is this Jaden's basically me
part two in a little boy body we have
the same personality we're both really
goofy they're both very chill this is
gold highlighter for the eye brush
highlighter for the eye brush let's do
it is it gonna go here - this is called
the tropic look you did a good job thank
you so much I look and I feel like a
tropical princess yes tropical friends

crease because nobody uses highlight on
their crease that is thinking outside of
the box
