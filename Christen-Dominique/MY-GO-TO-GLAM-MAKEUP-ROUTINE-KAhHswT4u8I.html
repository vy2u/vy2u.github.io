today I'm gonna be doing this super glam
makeup routine this is my go-to glam
makeup routine that I do if I'm going to
an event or a night out
definitely a purple coppery halo eye is
my go-to with a wing I think this is
such a beautiful look and it's gonna
look really pretty on any eye look
because this purple it has a reddish
undertone and it just looks beautiful on
every eye color I'm so excited to show
you guys how I got this look and not to
mention this is the second look from the
latte palette super exciting because
today is the actual pre-launch
if you're watching this right now I'm
probably at my launch party you can
check that out on snapchat you guys want
to see behind the scenes of what's going
on but for now I'm gonna be showing you
how to get this look if you guys want to
preorder the palette I will have the
links below just go to Dominique
cosmetics calm and you can pre-order
your palette today so I'm super excited
about that I am very excited to show you
this look as well so if you want to see
how to get it don't forget to subscribe
to my channel and hit that notification
bell so you can be a part of the quad
family and without further ado let's get
on with the video my brows in my last
video so I'm gonna do it in this one I'm
gonna be grabbing my like go to products
that I use for my brows so I always like
to start off with the foolproof brow
powder in number 5 right here I have no
nails because my nails have had it with
me they fell off they broke they're very
fragile just start to fill in the areas
that I want more brow it doesn't give
you a ton of payoff right away you can
build it up so I really like that and
then with the precisely my brow pencil
and number 5 just gonna go in to the
sparse areas I'll just go and hit this
spot really quick with a really light
hand and just sketch in that brow back
and forth so it just looks like normal
wild brow hairs I just love that look
lately this wild brow hairs I'm just
gonna fill in the very front part of my
brow I'm gonna make them look a little
bit more sharp of by putting on some
concealer so I'm gonna take my
heart-shaped tape and use
on the lid with a consider that we have
on our lid just gonna take a brush and
go right underneath and I feel like for
me a very defined brow shape is my go-to
kind of glam brow so along with the rest
I'm just gonna work it in with my finger
since I have the opportunity to use my
finger at its full capacity does that
even make sense
so the concealers gonna work for us in
two ways it's gonna give us a nice base
for our I shadow to stick on and it's
also going to define the brow and make
it just look more clean and the shape
look more prominent once the concealers
dried down I'm gonna go ahead and start
to work on my eyes and when I'm doing
more of a glam look I like to save the
face for later where I start working on
the eyes I'm gonna put on some primer so
that it by the time I get to the face
it'll already dry down so I'm going to
take the cover FX blurring primer comes
out just like a nude shade it's one of
those silicone based primers that you
kind of press into your pores so that
whenever makeup a lies right on top
it'll just glide over it and make your
skin look really even and smooth so I'm
just gonna press that in and then I'm
gonna take the Porefessional pearl
primer and I'm gonna use that right on
the cheekbones and underneath the eye
just to brighten up the eyes a little
bit more and right across the nose I
like that this primer smooths everything
out but at the same time it gives you
that illumination so really really like
that about this primer so now I'm gonna
start on my eyes and by the time I get
done with them my face will be
completely dry and prepped ready for
foundation I'm gonna take the latte
pallets I'm gonna do the second look
with it today the first color I'm
picking up is vanilla cream just to set
everything in place and also set right
underneath the brow bone I'm definitely
gonna bring that right on top the inner
corners just because I have been looking
a little sleepy lately and this is
definitely gonna brighten up that area
the next color I'm picking up is caramel
start to work this right around the
crease coming down towards the end of
the lid bringing it all the way to the
other side of the crease so this is
to be the first shade were laying down
to transition into that purple oh I
didn't tell you I was gonna use a purple
today but I am gonna use double shot
which is such a beautiful color first we
want to transition it so I'm going to
lay that brown down really nice all
around the eye skip the center of the
lid because we are going to pop on one
of the foil shadows in the center take
your hand put it at the back of your
brush and just lightly use circular
motions to blend out those edges I'm
pretty good with that intensity that I
have on the case right now so I'm gonna
start to work in the purple shade I'm so
excited about this so now I'm gonna go
in to double-shot which is this shade
right here Zeke until I've been using it
and I'm taking a Vasanti contour eye
shadow for brush like this this has
actually been one of my favorite brushes
that I've been gravitating towards so
I'm gonna start right here at this edge
such a beautiful purple I swear
double-shot is gorgeous so I'm gonna
take it right on the corner and then I'm
gonna start to bring it in bring it
right through that crease and all the
way over to the other end of the eye and
you guys can blend however you feel
comfortable you can either do these
windshield wiper motions going back and
forth or you can do circular motions
like this they some people even do these
rocking motions do any one of those and
just blend that eye shadow in it blends
out so beautifully I'm so happy with
these shadows I'm starting off pretty
soft and then what I like is to go a
little bit softer right in this crease
area right here I like to soften this up
but I like that corners of the eye to be
more intense when I'm doing a halo and
when I do this I sometimes I like to
keep it kind of rounded and just put
lashes on like wispy lashes but I also
don't mind doing a wing I don't mind
bringing the glam wing out with a halo
eye now I'm gonna take a little bit more
on my brush and build up this outer and
inner intensity make sure to keep that
soft hand that's the key to making your
eye shadow looks
super-super blended soft celebrity kind
of makeup so make sure that you guys are
using a light hand I know it's kind of
hard especially if you're in a rush you
want to just kind of get in there and
just you know but take your time
promise you using a light hand will
change your eyeshadow game I promise
so I'm gonna dip the same brush back
into caramel and work that right around
and blend it's just gonna look so
seamless and beautiful with caramel
right around it it's gonna make people's
eyes just instantly look into yours so I
really like to make sure that I have
this nice pretty glowing kind of halo
around the entire eye it just draws
people's attention to your eyes around
and I'm gonna deepen it up a little bit
more so I'm gonna take a smaller
densely-packed brush this is the makeup
Shakti 14 brush intensify this outer
corner even more see when you have
something that's densely packed like
this you're automatically gonna get more
pigment more color payoff in that spot
so just be ready to blend this out so I
always have a clean blending fluffy
brush on hand once I apply the amount
that I want then I'm gonna go ahead and
blend it out you can even take some of
the caramel and help and that'll help
blend out those edges and make them
really nice and soft so now I'm gonna
pop on the halo shade right in the
center I'm getting really excited about
it and this is creme brulee right here
sorry for my janky nail this is the
color that matches the palette spoil and
I'm gonna work that right in the center
this is really gonna bring all the
attention to your eyes and I absolutely
this love this color so now I'm just
gonna add a little bit of vanilla cream
right on the brow bone so I'm gonna take
this Sigma firm shader brush and just
work that right below so I grab my the
balm Schwing liner and I'm going to give
myself a wing my favorite mascara right
now is the LC lash for mascara I'm gonna
grab that pop on some mascara to my
lashes lashes I'm gonna pop on our from
the makeup shock they are called mad eye
and they're so pretty wispy fluttery and
fluffy at the same time you can see your
eye shape in the makeup so they're
perfect I'm gonna pop these on really
quick and I will be right back alright
so I am done with the okay so I am done
with the lashes the brows and the
eyelashes so now I'm gonna move on to
the rest of the face the face is very
prepped and ready for foundation right
now so I'm gonna grab my jouer essential
high coverage foundation this is my
go-to for a full coverage glam
foundation look so I am in the shade
almond when I'm not fake tanning I'm
just worth this and you don't even need
that much of this foundation because it
is extremely full coverage it covers
your whole entire life and one
application yeah I'm gonna work that all
the way down to the neck always work it
down to the neck so that everything that
looks like one even human gain rather
than two separate pieces so I'm going to
take the tart shape tape in light/medium
and just work that right on the
I'm actually putting away too much you
don't need this much but we are going
for a full coverage of lamb and honestly
this is how much I put on if it's a full
coverage go I am but routine kind of
thing this is the time where it's
extremely it's still wet and tacky and
ready to pick up powder so I'm gonna
take the this has been ever since I
found this wander beauty foundation
powder I have been loving it so much
it's super full coverage it makes your
skin look just like a blur filter like
it just looks super filtered so I love
it so I'm in the shade actually medium
but I'd actually like to try a lighter
shade so I'm just gonna swirl my damp
Beauty Blender around it look up and
then start to Pat that in really fast
that's when it soaks it up and just
looks so buttery and creamy it makes
your skin look so beautiful you know
what I'm gonna go ahead and do the same
thing I did to the top I'm gonna first
take caramel I'm gonna bring it all the
way in to the inner corners too every
time I look at caramel in the pan I just
want to pick it up and chew it is that
weird I think it is so delicious looking
I think because I looked at so many
different caramels when I was trying to
make this color that every time I look
at it I just see like a chewy salted
caramel just ooh okay now I'm gonna go
back into this tiny brush from the
makeup shock and work it into double
shot and start to blend that into the
lower lash line
this is gonna be closest to the lower
lash lines you still want that caramel
to peek through
brush fits in there perfectly so these
pan sizes are large and in charge so I'm
gonna take some a caramel and I'm gonna
start to work that on the cheekbone just
to bronze up and it'll make the look
just tie together really easy and
flawless so okay so now I'm just gonna
grab Kat Von D's shade and light palette
you guys know this might go to never
lets me down so I'm gonna take the
middle shade then I'll go straight
across to give me more of a button
turned up nose right underneath so that
it doesn't look super elongated and I'll
use a darker shade of contour right on
the bottom just so that it intensifies
that round look I'm trying to go for and
I'll bring these edges you know like
I'll curve it in so it looks more
rounded
then I'll take the banana shape I'll
just put it right on the end of the nose
here so that everything looks nice and
even and blended and voila we have a new
nose so for the highlight I think this
would be a perfect perfect match to the
latte palette this is coffee and cream
and this is the elf collaboration with
heart so I'm gonna take both of these
colors right here and pop them on to the
tops of my cheekbones and I'm sure you
guys know this but I love heart with all
my heart I'm gonna go ahead and work
that on I don't know if you I don't know
if you guys saw this when my family
turned off I went ahead and popped on ad
highlight to my Cupid's bow and did a
very light dust over the top of the nose
I'm gonna be taking the easy way sable
lipliner this is such a soft creamy lip
liner and then for the liquid lip I'm
going to do the huda beauty bombshell
liquid lip so I know works on the lips
that's been formula
