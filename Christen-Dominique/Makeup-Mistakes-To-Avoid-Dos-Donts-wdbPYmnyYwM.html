side this side the side to your little
eyeball hi you guys welcome back to my
channel so today I'm gonna be showing
you my makeup do's do's and eye makeup
don'ts if you have done any of these or
all of these don't worry because I have
done all of these all at one time that's
how I can easily tell you what's not to
do because I've done them all either
done these makeup don'ts because of a
trend that I wanted to do that I thought
would fit my face which actually doesn't
or because I just didn't know and it's
it's okay to not know because it's a
learning experience and you get better
and you grow from it and then you can
eventually teach someone else how to do
a technique a little bit better or
different so that it helps them and
their makeup skills you don't start off
as a professional makeup artist you
don't start off as being amazing at
makeup you start from somewhere and you
grow so don't worry about it this is a
learning experience I'm here to help you
through some of those skills and some of
those experiences and get better and
grow for yourself and I hope that you
enjoy this tutorial if you want to learn
how to get this and learn how not to do
this
go ahead okay so the first thing I'm
going to start off with is prepping the
skin I think that's the most important
part and I'm not gonna put primer on
this side would be my good side Lebanese
Smashbox photo finish primer I like this
one because it fills in the pores and it
just leaves like a smooth even surface
just silicon based primer grandma's in
town can you tell and on this side it's
just not going to last as long the next
thing I'm going to do is foundation I'm
gonna use a foundation that is going to
make me look a little bit more tan
because I like looking tan and I used to
do this mistake so often it's not cute
at all I learned throughout the years
that this is not the way you choose your
foundation this is a color I would like
to be this is my face this doesn't even
match my neck or some people what
they'll do is try to match their face
but then it won't match their neck or
the rest of their body we're just going
to rub it around which is another thing
you don't want to do don't just rub your
foundation around because if you rub it
around your face you're not going to get
the most coverage this actually kind of
matches maybe this was the wrong
foundation it's kind of weird just to do
one side of your face I'm trying not to
blend it if this is the color I would
like to be just look so cakey right now
I need a makeup wipe on the do side you
do want to choose a shade that is close
not to your face color but to the neck
anything that's going to match your neck
and chest is going to match the rest of
your body so I'm just going to take a
little bit of this foundation I'm gonna
take my Beauty Blender because the
Beauty Blender soaks up all the excess
foundation so you don't get too much on
your skin it just gives you the most
flawless coverage and application so I'm
going to take my Beauty Blender and
lightly bounce it on your skin
I don't really focus on the under eye
area too much I kind of just lightly go
over it just to even out the skin tone
because I'm going to go ahead and go in
with concealer in this area so leave it
how it is and really focus on the rest
of the face a lot of people want to use
the brightest concealer that they have I
would literally just follow where my
under a circle is and voila hi old self
this is what I would do literally I
would just focus on where my circle was
the lightest concealer I had because I
didn't want them to be dark DUP that is
not what you want to do you don't want
to go to light because you're just
attracting attention to that area it
makes it look like you're trying to
cover something up and it also
accentuates the shape of the circle what
you want to do choose a shade that's
about two shades lighter than your under
eye and I'm using this light medium
shade from Tarte take it where the inner
corner is bring it all the way down past
the under eye you see how it starts to
curve there we're going to go past that
and then we're going to bring it up all
the way up here to the cheekbone and
fill it in
make a v-shape under your under eye area
it looks seamless it blends into your
face your foundation you don't see a
harsh line or a reverse raccoon eye it
just looks a lot brighter and a little
bit more lip
did then your other eyes the next thing
is going in super heavy with powder on
your face without your foundation or
concealer drying so let me give you an
example I'm going to bed and take my
powder load it up and start to pack it
on my face it's just going to get really
patchy looking it's not going to look
good so on this side what I'm doing
after everything has dried I'm going to
go ahead and set my under eyes with a
translucent powder I'm going to be using
this powder right here from Elora
Mercier and just add a little bit of
translucent powder to that area let it
sit there for a little bit this is
called baking so once you let it sit for
a few minutes you're just going to dust
it off this is going to help your
under-eye from creasing you can kind of
already see the creases this is just
going to smooth out everything after
I've done that I'm going to go ahead and
go in with a powder and I'm just going
to lightly start to Pat it on to my skin
this is going to help everything else on
top of it go on a lot smoother it's also
going to help it really adhere to the
skin and so your makeup is going to last
a lot longer so the next thing I'm going
to do is contouring I'm going to go
ahead and take my Urban Decay beach
bronzer in sunkissed which is one of my
favorite bronzers I'm gonna go in with
my little paddle brush is what it looks
like to me start to contour my cheekbone
first and stake is I'm going in with an
orange bronzer I am going way too low
you don't want to go too low on your
cheek or too close to the corner of your
mouth so bronzer is used to warm up your
face and contour is to create a subtle
shadow that your face would naturally
have this is definitely something that
I've seen something that I've done and
never want to do again but what you do
want to do do do I'm going to use this
Kat Von D shade and light palette and in
this palette takes something that's
going to be a little bit more ashy or on
the gray tone side so I'm going to take
this shade right here and start to
contour my cheek bone on this side if
you look at your face and you kind of
just like look around don't look at this
side look around you'll notice that you
naturally have like a gray tone shadow
it's just the way the light hits your
face so you want to kind of mimic that
shadow by enhancing that death so you
want to go ahead and take something like
this I'm actually going to take a little
bit of this shade in the shade together
and then you want to use something that
is a little bit more precise that's
going to give you that precise
definition what I'm going to do is go
very close to my hairline and start to
work in that contour shade when I blend
it I'm not going to move past this area
I'm going to keep the contour shade
behind the apples of the cheek bone and
then I'm going to blend it upwards not
down because if you go down then you're
going to create this five o'clock shadow
and then if your contouring the nose you
go straight down your nose well I shaved
off a few inches of my nose actually
draws more attention to my nose so what
I'm going to do for the right side of my
nose so I'm going to use the same shade
except on this side I'm going to start
here and lightly sweep it the mid
section of my nose like right in here
you can already see the shadow and it's
kind of thinning it out and then once I
get to the tip of the nose I'm just
going to focus it in a V right here so
the next thing I'm going to do is my
cheeks I'm going to take this brush and
just start to go in I was on the dance
team for my entire high school years so
I used to love blush having a ton of
blush was just common in the dance team
everybody nude we were trained that
people want to see her makeup from way
far away high up in the bleachers and
during competition so we would put on a
ton of blush so literally I would start
here and just go in like my life
depended on it that I would make sure I
get the apples of the cheeks I had this
big Mary Kay kit and I would use that
bright reddish pink blush all the time
and I thought it was the hottest thing
so this is what you don't do you don't
want to go all the way on your Apple
smile and just rub it it what I like to
do not to say that this is the only way
to do your blush because I feel like
using a blush brush is completely fine
but I like to use a stippling brush
because I feel like it gives you the
freshest looking wash of color so what
I'm going to do is take my blush this is
like a peachy pink shade it's all about
the pressure that you put on
face that's going to change your makeup
game so much take my brush and work it
towards the apple the mid Apple and
sweep it back like this just adds a
really natural light flesh of color now
I'm going to move on to the brows which
are really interesting so I'm gonna take
my benefit precisely my brow pencil
start to fill in my brows and I'm gonna
use a heavy hand and I feel like I'm
missing so much of my brow that I'm just
gonna fill it all in and create a little
box in front because the front is so
light this is something that you
definitely don't want to do I feel like
we've all done this mistake that is just
way too dark so what you do want to use
is a very light hand and focus on the
areas where you have the least amount of
hair and I like to start right at the
bottom to add definition here and I'm
using the lightest feathery touch to my
brow I already have hair right here so
I'm not going to go over this spot stay
right here where there's like five or
six good long strand mimic their hair
shape and you want to fill in your brows
you want to fill in that area so that it
matches the outline but you want to use
the lightest hand the beginning of your
brow is light and feathery gradually go
into the darkest commit away and then if
you have like if you want to add a few
more hairs to the front just use very
light feathery strokes so you're not
going in like a block and then with a
spoolie side I'm just gonna brush
through the brows so that everything is
nice and even this brow is a lot more
natural-looking light and feathery this
one is just a big stamp so moving onto
the eye shadow a mistake that I see is
using a shimmery shadow on your crease
so I'm going to take this brown shadow
right here just going to work this
directly on to my crease it's fine that
it's dark but the only thing is it's
shimmery so it's kind of defeating the
purpose of creating depth because it's
attracting light to your crease and
bring it down right where the crease is
let's just blend out the edges let's
just say that I try to blend at least
but what I do want to you
is this matte warm taupe shade right
here this is going to give your eye
dimension add depth and also give you
the appearance of more lifted eye so I'm
going to apply it just above the crease
using a light hand gonna notice using a
light hand is the most important part of
doing your makeup in general just so
that you have more control of the
intensity so using a very light pressure
is the best way to go I'm not going to
focus too much on every step of do's and
don'ts for eyeshadow because there are
so many that could be a completely
different video for the eyeliner what I
used to do take the eyeliner here curl
it up and then bring it in all the way
like that some people might think that's
cute I sure did I would want a really
full thick wing and I want to curl it up
all the way to the brow I just wanted
this crazy amy winehouse cat eye this
side what you want to do with your
eyeliner is create elongated eyes shape
that's going to lower T and pretty
anyone your eyes to look lifted start
here and work my way outwards do
elongate your eyeliner lining it up to
the tail end of the brow so on this side
it just looks a lot more clean and
something that you could wear every day
for the lashes my old clubbing days I
would get these ardell lashes and I
would get the thickest ones they had the
thickest these are the double-up lashes
it literally looked like Hitler's
mustache I thought this was cute I would
buy a thick layer of glue and when they
wouldn't stick in the amount of time
that I needed to go out I would get so
mad and so frustrated and if I didn't
have my lashes on I was not going out
and it was like a part of my soul my
being covered my entire eyelid now we're
going to move on to a lash it's going to
look a lot better for your eye shading
so you can still see the shape of your
eye you can still see the eye shadow
it's just a lot softer and then after
I'm done with applying my lash then I'm
going to put some mascara on brush them
up to the false lash and then go back in
mesh the two together so you get one
even
looking lash so if I did a little bit
more on the eyeshadow then you would be
able to see all the work that I did also
it just accentuates your natural eye
shape really really nicely and lifts
your eye up highlight can either make
you look beautiful glowing or it can
make you look like a Horace spongy disco
ball so I'm going to take this Urban
Decay sin highlight and I'm just going
to apply a nice amount of highlights
going to accentuate all your pores so I
have to use it strategically on my face
what I'll do is take it right where this
the light will hit it so like right here
but I don't have so many pores there but
you're still going to give yourself that
really fresh glowing look and then now
I'm going to go ahead and move on to the
lips
I love a nude lip stand myth is one of
my favorite so I'm going to go ahead and
apply it on my lip this is obviously too
light but it doesn't mean that I can't
use it what I would suggest you guys do
is use a lip liner like so so I'm just
going to go ahead and line my lip and
then I'm just gonna go in a little bit
further on the inner corners so now we
have a defined lip shake the same nude
lipstick work it right over the lip so
now it just looks like you have a
gradient lip it looks lighter in the
center and then it gets darker I think
it's just a lot more flattering this way
this one's just like putting concealer
on your lip basically thank you guys for
