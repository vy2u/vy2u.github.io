get married and have this baby right
here hello hi
check mm-hmm ha ha
what the heck my hair is falling apart I
can't even see it everyone welcome back
to my channel so today I am doing my
March favorites for you guys yes it's
here it came by so fast and it's gonna
be April pretty soon and then it's gonna
be the end of the year crazy I'm gonna
be doing a Q&amp;amp;A very soon so you guys
leave me your questions below any
question you have I will be getting from
this video to answer on my Q&amp;amp;A video
which I've never really done I think
it's about that time
just put your question below so I have a
bunch of beauty and skincare for you
guys some fashion so let's just jump
right into it I got this foundation for
my Cinderella video cuz I was looking
for something that was extremely full
coverage I just wanted to look super
flawless and I did some researching and
the Kat Von D locket tattoo foundation
was supposedly it and it is it's not
like an everyday foundation I feel like
everybody should have this like a
special occasion I'm in the color medium
actually this is really dark on me so I
had to like mix in a little bit of a
lighter foundation so I'm gonna actually
go down a little bit on this this is
medium 56 I am probably two shades
lighter than that but if you are two
shades darker than this is your color I
forgot to put on my blinky lights so I'm
about to put them on right now I feel
like everybody should have blinky lights
in their room this is not my room but if
it was my room I'd have these lights two
lipsticks that make this color on my
lips that I have on now got a lot of
compliments on it and I just love how
it's like reddish pink it's a really
sultry color and perfect for like spring
summer time with bronzed skin it just
it looks amazing using the Gerard
cosmetics lipsticks I mixed red which is
a matte red this is fire-engine and then
all dolled up super bright pink lipstick
together it just makes this beautiful
color if you need to get married and
have this baby right here for powder
I've been using the Urban Decay Naked
Skin Ultra Definition powder foundation
it's extremely I mean it gives you
amazing coverage mattifies your skin is
so good and it covers up everything so I
have this one in this is a medium
neutral and ya have it on right now it
looks like you have like a blur filter
on so this is this is good this is a
good one
oh my hi Lee I've been into the makeup
forever Pro sculpting duo it has like a
pink undertone that's what makes it look
more natural like an opal iridescent
beautiful beautiful highlight it's not
even illuminating it's a step higher
than illuminating it's like I'm gonna
make up my own word for this it looks
amazing
I have it on right now I have it on the
tip of my nose on the tops of my
cheekbones and a little bit like right
above the brow this is 0-1
I've never had an eyelash glue in a
favorites video and I've never really
had a favorite eyelash glue but this one
is just like heaven set Oh first of all
it's amazing because it comes with a
brush tip so you can precisely get your
glue right on the strip the lash glue is
intense so the only thing about this is
that it hurts when you take it off my
lashes don't fall off later on in the
day like this last 12 hours if I wanted
it to usually I have like the inner
corners start to pull up or the outer
corners but with this it doesn't budge
and as soon as you put it on that's
where it's sticking so you gotta kind of
make sure you're precise with where
you're putting it but I mean just it's
amazing it lasts all day it's very heavy
duty strong eyelash glue so yeah this is
my favorite eyelash glue for this month
you guys should definitely check it out
for fashion I have been
wearing this skirt here it's a midi
skirt and so it comes to like the knee
area I'll try it on for you guys and it
has pockets on the side it's really soft
and like comfortable but it still looks
very dressy can wear either a crop top
with it make it a little casual or dress
it up so I just really like it because
the material is really soft but it looks
kind of dressy so I've been really
liking it and especially the pockets
this one is from Lulu's and this
actually it's it's from Lulu's but the
brand is Olivia Olivier sheis and I'm in
a small I've been wearing these J Oh a
shorts it looks like a skirt actually
it's super roughly I like how they have
like layered ruffles on the side and
then they have like this is a random
piece of fabric hanging right in front
like my husband was like what are you
wearing is that a skirt or what is that
but I like it I was like don't hate
because it's super cute I like the way
it makes my legs look longer and it's
kind of high-waisted so it helps the
tummy area feminine and like roughly and
actually had them in my lookbook that
you guys saw on was that I uploaded that
what Friday they are cute
oh my god can I just tell you how much
I'm in love with this ring it's a claw
that looks like it's clasping your thumb
so this one is from Missouri and it's
this claw ring it made of gold and
dipped in sterling silver also this ring
it's called the evil eye ring you can
actually wear this as a MIDI ring which
is really cute and then you can probably
wear like a bracelet harness on your
hand that would look cute but I'm
wearing it as just a regular ring today
keeping it simple for my nails I've been
liking the China Glaze nail lacquer with
hardener I'm right now I'm into these
bright colors here the ones that kind of
remind you of pretty much a highlighter
and this is in the color highlight of my
summer and it really does just like look
like a seafoam highlighter which I
really like I like
these bright colors for my skincare I've
been using the clear start foam wash it
really gets into your oars and cleans
them out clears them up and I use this
with like a spin brush that I have and
it just together works amazing I feel
like I have new skin now it also smells
really good so it's made with tea tree
and lavender it's just very calming
soothing scent and it feels really good
on your skin oh and the top is really
cool too all you have to do is pop it
open and it pops you just push that
button in and it just pops open for my
face moisturizer I've been using the
Peter lamas nourishing oil moisturizer
it's pretty lightweight just feels
really refreshing and soothing the next
skincare product I've been using often
is the hand cream by be delectable from
cake beauty and strawberry and cream and
my hands can get pretty dry especially
with the bath and body we're going hand
washes that I use I have really dry skin
I'll get like patches on my my hands if
I don't use it so I have this right by
my sink and it just smells like a burst
of strawberries and yummy amazing I also
had the lemon one it's lemon cake and it
smells like a lemon cake and then I
actually I think I'm done I feel like
I've been talking Aram Lee and just like
what I'm done it's over pretty much I'm
