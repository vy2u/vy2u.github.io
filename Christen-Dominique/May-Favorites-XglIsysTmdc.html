my stuff already set out Kim over here
this morning set it up and have some
clothes makeup hair body skincare stuff
so I'm going to start I'm gonna get
started with that and I'll see you on my
other camera camera - lets go oh wait
wait before I let you go on this camera
the 70d I use a lot of you guys app I
use a Canon 5d Mark 3 and what is you
know the ones do you happen to know
24-105 24 105 105 is the lens guys asked
that all the time and finally Jeff SPF
knows the answers so let's go and get
started
I just want to let you guys know that
this wing was an accident it was
supposed to be a little tiny flick that
turned into this big dramatic batwing
but I think it looks really good I just
went with it and it ended up being a
really nice dramatic cat eye so that's
my story about that let's just jump into
the makeup I'm going to talk about my
shade light from Kat Von D my absolute
favorite go-to all-over highlight and
contour I can do my eyes with this I
could do my full face with this palette
and it has these three colors at the top
for I use this for my under eyes mainly
you can use it for highlight - and I
like to use this salmon powder under my
eyes because it feel like it cancels out
that darkness underneath and then I use
this middle bronzer to
just to hollow out the cheekbones the
temples the besides of the nose to make
it a little bit more straight and the
tip a little bit more narrow and then to
really get that contour I use the
darkest color to define the cheekbones
and the other places on my face kind of
like with your eye shadow you want to
start off with the lightest color here
and then gradually use the darkest one
where you want to you want definition so
that's basically what I do to my face
and this is the palette I use for my
eyes for my face and for my everyday my
favorite highlight this month has been
from gerard cosmetics this is the star
powder and the color Marilyn and it's
really creamy it's a golden illuminating
highlight it's very pretty I just use a
little bit right here on the bridge of
my nose and I can swatch it for you guys
so it looks like that moving on to the
eyes I love this palette I feel like
it's every girls everyday palette there
are so many different looks you can do
with it from day to night they have a
purple row a pink to brown and a taupe
to black for a more dramatic look on
your eyes this free spirit is my
favorite because it has a yellow
undertone and the darks are just okay
kin intense I love it so what I'm going
to do for you guys
because I love it so much in the night
give up a little way to you along with a
hundred dollar gift card to tart so you
guys can get some extra stuff to go
along with your palette make sure you
check the end of this video to find out
how to enter the giveaway for the
palette and the hydraulic deck card my
favorite lips are going to be right now
I have both of these on I started off
with this one this is from Tarte this is
the color serene and these are the lip
surgence lip cream
they're very creamy so this one is more
of a nudie color and it has like a minty
scent to it which is nice on your lips
because it's close to your teeth and in
case you have bad breath and then I have
this one this is in the color vintage
just more of a warm pink color and I
like these because you can if it starts
to run low on you you just twist it up
and bam you got a whole new it whoa it
gets pretty big look at that I think
I've had these since February so they
last a pretty long time I thought these
were really good they're very hydrating
creamy they lately leave your lips
feeling really soft the color lasts a
good while and they're really pretty
colors I suggest you guys if you're into
nudes and Pink's like I am then check
these colors out if I like it you're
definitely gonna like it too okay so for
fashion I've been loving these squirts
I haven't loving these shorts that look
like skirts they're comfortable you
don't have to worry about them flying up
oh yeah I got this that white fox
boutique and I also got I actually got
two other pairs and different designs
and they are high-waisted it looks like
a skirt which is cute Java I like this
because it's just flattering on your
body and feminine
I like the floral pattern on it and I
usually pair it with a crop top this one
I have been wearing this matches
perfectly out of nowhere I don't know
how this happened but awesome I've been
wearing this with it and it's really
cute I have an Instagram picture I'll
post it right here for you guys you can
check out what I look like in it issues
are also from Lulu's I like the heel
because it makes it easier to walk in
but it's definitely not super
comfortable not like I can walk in them
all day because there's no like this
front part is very flat I feel like if
it was like a little bit of a platform
in the front I would feel a lot more
comfortable walking around with these
all day I try to walk around with them
in djenne Beauty this weekend and it was
a little ridiculous I got home and I was
like oh my god did I like what did I do
to my feet it hurts so bad so yeah I
mean it's easier to walk around in
because of the heel but the front is
torture
so what I've been loving for my
nighttime skincare routine is this Tarte
Sea brightener eye treatment and it's a
pretty thick cream but it works great if
if you're hydrating at night it does
melt into your skin it is pretty thick
but it absorbs really quickly so that's
nice
it's supposed to brighten your eyes and
usually I'm kind of like skeptical about
creams brightening your eyes because
they never work but this one actually
does work I don't know if it I mean it
instantly brightens your eyes a little
bit but I don't know if it's slowly
helping them become brighter because I
feel like it's just hereditary I have
dark under-eye circles and then for my I
guess this is body because this is my
neck I've never used a neck cream but
Tarte sent me this for Mother's Day so I
decided to try it out and this is a
really heavy thick cream it's supposed
to improve this your skin appearance on
your neck and decollete and it reduces
fine lines and wrinkles I don't have
that yet but I already hydrate my neck
and decollete every night as this is
specifically for that area it's fun to
use it so I've been using it I mean I
don't know if it does it makes a
difference but I know the the eye
treatment works
so I'm guessing eventually this will
help me have less wrinkles on my neck it
feels really silky and smooth on your
neck and you know you want to stay
younger longer you probably want to
hydrate your neck area so when I'm in
the shower I find myself grabbing a
handful of this stuff because it's just
so fun to grab it has like a jelly light
consistency it's an exfoliator from
Pacifica this is the Kona coffee and
sugar detox with coconut oil and it's a
whole body scrub it's smooth and it
tones your skin and it smells really
yummy - it smells like coffee with
creamer it's like light coffee with
creamer oh I just got some on my chin
but I like using this stuff because for
one it makes my body feel really soft -
it smells awesome
and three there was a third reason I
just oh the way it feels the way it
feels the way it smells the way it makes
my body feel is just an explosion of
Awesomeness if that's not really
attracting you to this because it was
like ooh it's gonna improve the
appearance of my skin texture you know I
don't want skin texture I just want it
to be smooth but um I'm human so that's
probably humanly impossible so um yeah
but it helps with that it makes your
body smell good and I love it um yeah oh
and usually when I use exfoliant they
kind of are rough on your skin and
doesn't feel very good but this one has
like a soft jelly texture and the little
beads are very cushy so it's definitely
the best exfoliator I have used so if
you're in texts foliate in your body if
you tan a lot like i do i don't i do
sunless tanning so i can using right now
I'm using loving tan and it's just like
a mousse so I use that pretty often and
it can get really weird and flaky around
my neck area so I like to exfoliate
pretty much weekly but when this is in
my shower I do it pretty much every day
um it just feels so good and squish for
my hair I don't like washing it every
day because I have a dry skin and my
scalp tends to form these white flakes
on it it's really just not attractive
like to keep the natural oils in it so I
watch my hair i watch my hair like um
every other day or sometimes like I
won't wash it for like three days
because I'm lazy whatever but what I
definitely will do is use the shoot
shoot Murrah a cleansing oil shampoo it
helps balance your hair moisture and
it's great for dry scalps and dry hair
especially if you have color treated
hair like I do it's great to just bring
in that moisture you know what I really
want to do I want to do a shower routine
so you guys can see everything that I
use on my body my hair um everything I
use in the shower I use I even use
different skincare in the shower it's a
whole like thing let me know if you want
to see
um because I would be video my hair is
very natural today I didn't really have
time to do it so I just embraced my
natural my natural hair beauty and left
it frizzy and kind of just wavy and so
just to tame it a little bit I used this
Shea Moisture coconut and hibiscus
frizz-free curls like cool it smells
good and it's all natural it's made with
coconut oil silk protein and neem oil
which controls the frizz and also adds a
little bit of a shine to it it gives you
a really soft silky feel when you run
your fingers through your hair you know
like you know when you use mousses and
it feels kind of crunchy and crispy it's
definitely not like that um it feels so
soft that I feel like I didn't even put
any in my hair so I run my fingers
through it I run my fingers through it
and I'm just like I need more it's not
crunchy enough they're an all-natural
brand and they're really cool the only
thing that I use from them is this guy
so um and I really like it my mom has
really thick coarse curly hair so she
uses it in anything she uses I feel like
is really good I get all of my hair
advice from my mom and she has she
should be like a hair guru do the houses
