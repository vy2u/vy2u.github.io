excited aren't you excited excited for
what for a future day silly okay what's
so great about picture day Frankie you
shouldn't underestimate picture day eh
for the last forever we need to get to
work I guess you're right but wait what
are we getting to work for making
ourselves look fabulous of grace okay
see you later I'll meet you at school I
advise jumping straight into the
tutorial I'm putting on my pinkyparadise
contacts one of them is blue and the
other is green just like Frankie has and
these are circle lenses so my eyes look
extra large today which makes me look
like a creepy doll and that's okay
for the green-skinned I'm using a white
and green cream makeup I got from the
Halloween store and I mix the two colors
together to get Frankie's green skin and
I evenly apply this evenly applied a
pretty thick layer of it and I didn't
use much water
maybe that's why this paint cracked so
badly on me I'm thinking I should have
just done a thinner layer but either way
I ended up redoing it and thankfully my
friend had professional body paint on
hand so I went back over my skin using
the mehron body paint and I just took
some water and the paintbrush whirled it
around in the white and a green shade
and it worked beautifully did not crack
the color came out a bit darker but
that's okay I think it still looks
pretty good for the contour shade I'm
using this morphe palette and picking up
the darkest green and just sweeping this
under my cheekbone temples and forehead
to give my face definition
next I'm taking this lighter shade of
green to dust over my entire face and
help even out and add a tad more
coverage now I'm using these two
lightening shades to highlight as I
normally would and I'm just highlighting
the tops of my cheekbones the center of
my forehead and also down the bridge of
my nose for the base and transition
color I'm taking this hot pink and
purple ish pink color and I'm just going
to sweep it along my lids and crease
now I'm going to pick up this dark
purple color and apply it to my lids and
lower lashline
taking the same fluffy brush I used to
apply the transition color I'm going to
blend the edges of the lid color and an
upwards motion
for the brow bone I'm using this white
shadow to highlight
after I've packed on the amount of high
light I need because I'm not going to
lie it was kind of hard to get the white
to be kind of opaque um then I'm going
to use a clean fluffy brush to blend the
highlight downwards so that it fades
into the other colors to fill in my
eyebrows I'm using a matte black shadow
and an angled brow brush from Anastacio
to fill them in
now I'm taking the bombs
Schwing liquid liner to create my winged
liner
to add extra definition to the lower
lashline I'm using the cargo black
pencil liner on my waterline after the
fun part at least for me because I feel
like the lashes really brought together
the look I took one pair of wispy lashes
and another spiky pair and I mesh them
together with my kiss black liquid
adhesive and I let them get tacky for
about 30 seconds and then my and then I
placed them on to the center of my lash
my lash line and then attached one side
at a time and bam I feel like it made
the book even more dolly and cartoonish
so and then I took a pair of another
light pair of lashes and it's just a one
set and I put them on the lower lash
line
and I flip them over and then I filled
in the gap with some black liquid liner
to complete the look I used the bare
minerals lipstick in the color live it
up it's a pretty bright cherry red color
and to me it's a high shine lip color
this is the final look I had so much fun
doing this skit with Karis and I feel
like we created our own little real-life
cartoon show if you enjoyed it give it a
thumbs up and here is the rest of
I love it let's do this alright
