we're gonna be talking about underrated
makeup makeup that is so good
so bomb but nobody's talking about it
these are diamonds in the rough
I feel like these products aren't
getting as much love as they should be
getting so I'm going to show you a full
face using nothing but underrated
products so if you want to see how I got
this look right here using the most
underrated products in the universe then
subscribe to my channel and hit that
notification bell so you can be a part
of the club family and without further
adue letters I'm going to talk about
primer there are two primers that I
really like someone to tell you about
both of them
I really don't hear anybody talking
about the japonesque primer it is such a
good primer it doesn't leave your skin
feeling oily fills in pores it just
makes your skin so super smooth and
velvety it's called the japonesque a
Velvet Touch primer and you guys have to
try it and then this new primer I have
to tell you guys about I actually used
it in my last video from Orient's the
pink perfect cream it just makes your
skin look super plum it just brightens
it up it gives it life and it also blurs
out any imperfection so both of these
guys right here you guys have to try I'm
actually going to be using this one
today because it's my new favorite that
I just found out about but this is an
old favorite that I don't ever hear
anything about as you can tell I've used
a lot of it I'm going to go ahead and
pop this one on right here because it
just makes your skin look so flawless
also if you have any texture it's going
to help the texture on your skin look
less noticeable and it smells so good so
the next underrated product I am going
to talk about is this CC cream which is
also from herb Oriya and it's the CC
cream in illuminator if you watched my
last video you could literally visibly
see the difference in my skin and I have
been using this ever since I came back
from Korea I love it so much and I use
it everyday even if I'm not wearing
makeup I still use it over time it's
supposed to help with the texture on
your skin is
so just these two together it's just
such a great combination for my skin
type but I don't hear anybody talking
about this brand at all if anything
people are like what is that brand where
do I buy it from it's actually at
Sephora they've just got into the u.s. I
think that's why not very many people
know about them but they are so great
the CC cream comes out like this it's
white and it has encapsulated pigments
in it so when you work it into your skin
it warms up to your skin's natural pH it
gives you the best color for your skin
tone you guys know I love my full
coverage foundation I use it all the
time any time I'm going to any event so
this tells you a lot about this CC cream
there is a nice coverage there and it
looks natural and I just I'm in love
with the fact that it doesn't look like
I have a lot of makeup on it doesn't
look like I have a cake face and it just
looks like I have a nice healthy skin
and the thing about this is that it is
buildable so you can start off with
light coverage and then you can build up
the coverage and it doesn't feel like
I'm just taking on makeup it feels like
you're putting on more moisturizer it
also has a SPF of 25 when you go out in
the Sun your skin is protected its
hydrated its luminous and soft it just
looks like pretty skin all right so
let's hide those under-eye circles I
don't ever hear anybody talking about
this this is from Mally Beauty it is a
perfect prep under eye brightener more
recently this comes in a white squeeze
tube instead of this pot which i think
is genius because this can get a little
messy but I do really like what this
does to your under eye circles helps
with cancelling out that blue undertone
masks the dark circles completely this
is like an oldie but goodie and people
if you have dark under-eye circles you
need to have this in your life I am just
going to work that right there just
three little dots this is another
product that's very hydrating and almost
like skincare moreso than makeup so
anything that's going to help your skin
improve over time and at the same time
help it look good right now instantly is
awesome as you can see it automatically
brightens up ever
in that area it may look scary because
it's bright yellow and it's in a jar you
can still get it in a jar some places on
Amazon Walmart if you go on Ulta or
Malibu decom it will be in a white
squeeze tube so just to let you guys
know what to look out for and it looks
so natural okay so let's get those brows
in shape they're all over the place so
I'm going to go ahead and use two
products that I don't see anybody
talking about on YouTube or very rarely
do they mention these products the first
thing is this brow and liner brush I
feel like I talked about this a lot but
I don't see anyone else this is from
blink it's their brow liner duo brush
the brush is super narrow and the
spoolie is so tightly packed with these
bristles that it just pulls all the brow
hairs up and you actually feel like it's
working as a spoolie should rather than
just kind of sometimes when I see
spoolie is I'm just like eh they don't
really work how a spoolie should work
this one actually does its job so that's
why I really like this brow brush that
nobody talks about have it in your life
it's awesome I'm also going to use this
right here this is from Wet n Wild you
can tell that I use it a lot I've
actually already lost the top it just
broke off thing that I really like about
this palette isn't the top it's the
product inside this is from wet and wild
it's the ultimate brow kit I love it so
so much there's so many other really
amazing brow products than if it has
awesome stuff honest Asya for an
affordable price this guy is so good
there's a reason why I keep coming back
to it it's super affordable stays in
place all day I love the shades in the
little compact they always match my
brows perfectly so I'm just going to go
ahead and fill in my brows with this
really quick I'm gonna move on to the
eyeshadow now I feel like nobody talks
about cargo as much as they should talk
about cargo at all I don't see it on
YouTube very much if you see it please
let me know in the comments I don't get
to see every single youtuber on YouTube
but they have really good high-quality
eyeshadows which trips me out I've had
the essential palette from cargo for a
while and I love it they're all more of
a cooler tone side but they're so pretty
they're very pigmented they're
me they're really really nice shadows
they just recently launched this palette
right here it's such a pretty like
festive summery looking palette it looks
like this inside it's so beautiful look
at the shades so many crease shades lid
shades they're shimmery shades all the
shades that I want there's pops of color
it's a gorgeous palette I'm going to be
using this palette to create an eye
shadow look today on my eye
so the first colors I'm going to pick up
in this palette are wakiki right here
and hibiscus I'm going to take that in
with a crease brush from the makeup
shock which is another brand that I feel
like not many people talked about but
it's they have really great brushes so
I'm going to take this brush right here
this is from the makeup shock it's the
t44 and I'm going to use that to blend
these shades into my crease I'm going to
go in with another crease shade this one
is Tiki it's the darker Brown and on a
makeup Shakti 63 brush is more of a
detailed crease brush work that color
into the outer crease I'm going to kind
of extend it out a little bit past the
crease so we can make the lot of the
eyes look a little bit more elongated
now what I'm going to do is take
hibiscus right here this is the t44
brush and then I'm going to work it on
the entire rest of the lid and all the
way around the darker Brown I'm also
going to bring it down on the lower lash
line as well and then on the bottom lash
line I'm going to take this color right
here this is Chi take that and pop it on
to the outer part of the lid I mean the
outer part of the lower lash line and
then on the inner corners I'm going to
take hoola and for that top for the brow
bone I'm going to take Hapuna
I'm going to go right under the brow
bone I just want to jump my eye in this
high and Apple yellow shade it's so
pretty it's like a burnt yellow
pineapple I'm gonna go ahead and line my
lashes I found the most darkest
creamiest eyeliner it's this one right
here from M cosmetics I don't see much
hype on this eyeliner but super dark
very creamy and take it right along the
upper lash line and also on the lower
lash line this eyeliner is super creamy
so I'm gonna go ahead and smoke it out
with just a little liner brush just to
smudge it out it almost reminds me of a
gel liner because it's just so creamy
now we need to put some drama on our
lashes so I'm going to use these ones
right here these are the makeup Shaq
lashes in style Miami and they are so
clashes I don't hear people talking
about their lashes at all I just I mean
the brushes I've seen few people will
talk about them not really too crazy but
their lashes I definitely have haven't
heard anything from and they have really
nice lashes so I'm just going to pop
these on really quick and show you what
they look like they're nice full and
wispy they're really easy to apply they
just pop on your lashes they're not too
curved and there's not too much you have
to cut off okay the next thing we're
going to talk about is the Frankie rose
contour palette which I don't hear
anything about at all
it's a pigmented palette it easily
blends in with the other shades looks
like this there are six shades in here a
banana shade a cream shade this is a
highlight and then these three down here
or contour colors to me I feel like this
can be actually just like a powder for
the entire face to probably clean it
honestly before I show you guys a little
bit better has like a magnetic closure
on it so it closes right away I'm gonna
use the yellow shade to really lock in
and brighten the under eye and then I'm
going to bring it down around the
corners of the mouth where it's kind of
dark in this area just to brighten that
up to contour the cheeks I'm going to
take tempting and heated and
do a light shade right under the
cheekbone bring it around the temple I
love how it gives me an extra layer of
coverage contour colors are very natural
looking and just blend into the skin so
easy always love to put on a nice
bronzer I've have heard some people talk
about this but it's not like crazy all
over the place but the Physicians
Formula butter bronzer is so nice also
the Rimmel natural bronzer is a bronzer
that I really like and I go to so if
you're looking for a a nice affordable
bronzer these two are my favorites this
gives you more of a I just got out of
the Sun finished tanning kind of glow so
I let really like this for that but this
one I feel like you can even contour
with if you wanted to
this one is more natural-looking and
this one is a little bit more of it I
just finished tanning in the tanning bed
so either one of these are going to be a
really nice pick for you guys if you
want a nice affordable bronzer oh this
one smells so good though I'm going to
take this one because it smells so
amazing and smells just get me going so
I'm going to go ahead and pop that onto
my cheeks just to bronze up my skin give
it some color and bring it around the
temples
I think city color has a wide range of
really good products but they have
really nice matte blushes they have
shimmery blushes this is more of a
rustic bronzy blush palette but then
they also have this kind of rosy one
right here which is going to give you
like a nice pretty flush of color and I
take the lightest shade and pop that
onto my cheese this is from the brand
Golani I was so Lord whenever I just
watched this highlight right here this
is the celestial skin luminizing powder
in teeth and I'm just going to swatch it
for you guys right on my hand actually
swatched it in my last video oh it is
beautiful they also have in love most
intense Instagram highlights that I have
seen in a really long time they're not
as big for one because when you look at
the packaging it just gives you a data
to feel but the product inside it is so
good they'll like the Rudolph the Red
Nosed Reindeer of highlights right now
Bobby Brown liquid lips
they're so cute it literally looks like
a crayon how adorable is that it's like
a little squeezy tube so i'm Sampath on
you can throw this in your bag they're
super
easy to travel with it's just such a
cool innovative way to use the liquid
lipstick just really like it it's called
the art stick liquid lipstick thank you
