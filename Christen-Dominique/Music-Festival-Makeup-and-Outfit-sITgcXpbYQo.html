that all over my lid all the way up to
the brow bone next I'm going to take
fawn this contour shade right here that

this makeup forever palette and I'm
taking this shade right here this is

much and then after I kind of place it
where I want and then I'm just going to
blend it in with a small blending brush
right here don't remember which brush
this is I'm sure it's a Luxy brush I'll
have it listed below and then I go over
with a fluffier blending brush to buff
it out and then I realize hold on
I'd still have my bake face on so I wipe
it off I completely forgot about it so
I'm just wiping it off and then I'm
gonna go back in with a blending brush
and just blend in the black to the brown
and also on the lower part of the eyes
I'm going to take fawn just to add some
depth on the lower lash line and then
I'm taking this random brush that I had

and so I just took it and ran it along
my lower lashes then I'm going to take
my makeup forever ink liner then I'm
going to go ahead and wing it out when
in doubt wing it out
so for the top lashes I'm going to use
my velvet noir mascara from Marc Jacobs
and then on the bottom lashes I'm going
to use my Mac mascara I don't know the
name exactly but I'll have it listed
below I just liked how it has that spiky
brush so it gets in really defines every
lash and then I'm going to take my
makeup Forever aqua liner black eyeliner
and then I'm going to take the blue
liner and line right below the black I'm
the blue liner is going on the lash line
and the black liner was on the waterline
so I'm going to take a little bit of
that blue shade that I dip my brush into
and then I'm gonna kind of smoke out the
bottom and then I'm going to go ahead
