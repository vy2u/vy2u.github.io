the Electric Daisy Carnival which is a
music festival filled with thousands of
different light art creations DJs and
carnival rides it looks super fun and
colorful so I thought I'd do a look
inspired by it I definitely stepped out
of my comfort zone for this look but it
was really fun to try I also did a
collab on this look with Ellen dish who
created the EBC inspired nails so check
her out at the end of the video to cover
my blemishes in circles and using the
cover FX Foundation which I was really
excited to get I've heard so many good
things about the coverage and today I'm
actually using it as a concealer
since this makeup is for an outdoor
event you want to only use heavy
coverage where you really need it if you
even need it so I'm going to lightly Pat
this into my under eye circles and
blemish areas with a clean ring finger
to give myself an all-over light
coverage and even complexion I'm going
to dab on the linage BB cushion and this
is a really cool Korean product that
just came over to the US it's super
lightweight I've never seen anything
quite like it you apply it by pressing
the puffs into the moistened sponge and
then you Pat that onto your face it's so
natural looking I like that it brightens
your skin and it protects you from the
UVA and UVB rays so when you're out
there dancing your little heart out in
the Sun your face is well protected and
fresh looking to seal my under eye
makeup in place I've kind of been
obsessed with the honest dasya yellow
and pink powder in the contour kit I use
them together and with a large fluffy
brush I just Pat that under my eyes to
add a tad more coverage and also sets it
in place all day
to set the rest of my makeup in place
I'm a lightly padding on the cover FX
powder to add some moisture to my lips
and using the Jessie's Girl vitamin seed
bomb now it's time for the brows this is
the part where you frame your face so
I'm first going to comb through them
with a spoolie and then taking the
brunette powder from Anastasia to fill
in the sparse areas of my brows using an
angled brow brush once I filled in the
bald spots I comb through them once
again and then I grab my dip brow in the
color evany to define the shape by
lining the lower part of my brow and I
also draw in the tail since there really
isn't much there this step gives them a
nice even shape
now to clean and enhance the shape of
your brows by taking a bit of concealer
onto a concealer brush and filling in
the brow bone also cleaning up any
mistakes
I feel like this part really makes your
brows pop now I'm just prepping my
lashes so that they're nice and curled
using the lorac tantalizer highlighter
in matte bronzing duo I'm going to slim
down and define the features of my face
by taking that matte bronzer and lightly
applying it to the hollow areas of my
face and this is the scary face I made
with the light behind me fell but we got
it fixed no one was hurt and most
important the contour was completed and
now for the fun part and using the
electric palette from Urban Decay to
create this vibrant I look and I'm
definitely stepping out of my comfort
zone for this but it was so fun to come
up with a look using all of these
beautiful vibrant colors the first color
I'm picking up is a savage and I'm
applying that onto my lid
after I was done with this lid I went
back to the other lid to bring it up a
bit more and then with a large fluffy
brush I blended the color upwards and
now I'm taking the color urban to create
a sharp defined crease all the way
through the start of the brow bone I'm
going to be using my Mac 239 brush and
placing the color along the crease and
then blending it upwards
for the brow bone highlight I'm using
the color pearl from the lorac Pro to go
palette and I'm placing the color under
the brow bone and then using a fluffy
brush to blend it down into the other
colors for a smooth transition I'm
picking up the color revolt and using
this as an inner corner highlight using
a pencil brush for a precise application
and then using a loose detailed brush to
smooth the edges now taking the color
thrash and placing it on the outer
corner of the lower lid
next I'm picking up the color freak and
placing it just beside thrash and then
blending it with a clean brush I'm going
to be doing the same thing with the next
few colors next is Gonzo's turn and he
is going right beside freak and then I
love these memes and then I'm picking up
the color chaos and blending that out
this is the last color for the lower
lash line as I was blending everything
together I lost some of the vibrancy of
the green so I just went back into it
and then blended the lower part of the
line now I'm taking the Sigma eye pencil
in the color indigo and creating a wing
on my top lashline and I did the same
thing to the other eye I just kind of
went down under and looked closely at a
bear for this part but now I'm taking
gonzo and going back over the liner to
intensify the blue color here I'm
applying a nude pencil to the waterline
now I'm taking the matte black shadow to
enhance the sharp crease and blend of
the color upwards for a nice transition
doubt a pump up my lashes I am using my
current favorite mascara which sadly is
kind of hard to take off because it is
waterproof and I don't want to use it
often but I love the length fullness and
the amazing curl hold it has without
clumping can this just please be a non
waterproof mascara so I can use it
everyday now to add a hint of color to
my cheeks i'm using the sigma born to
blusher for an illuminating highlight
i'm using the lorac highlighter to the
tops of my cheekbones center of my brows
down my nose and my chin for the lips
and using a concealer to cancel out any
unnatural lip pigmentation because i
found these cool amazing glowing
iridescent glosses and I wanted them to
stand out so I'm using the bare minerals
marvelous Moxie gloss and hypnotic which
is an iridescent opal color and then for
the center of the lips I'm using
Jessie's Girl glow sticks gloss in Red
Dawn I love the neon glow effect it
gives and I thought it fit perfectly
into the theme of the video and this is
the final look I hope you enjoyed the
colorful eye look I did also go check
