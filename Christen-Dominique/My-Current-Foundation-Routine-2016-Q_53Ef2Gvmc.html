today I'm going to be showing you my
current favorite everyday foundation
routine I use tons of different
foundations if you're on my snapchat you
know that I would like use all kinds of
different ones but this is one of my top
foundations that I like using this is
the rainforest of this sea water
foundation I like how it's very
lightweight but the coverage is so
amazing I love it so much and my skin
actually breathes that's what I love
about it if I could be on an island
stranded the one product that I would
take with me is foundation if my skin
looks good
I feel good I also included an eye
shadow look and I used the chocolate
bonbon palette and I figured why not
give it away to one of you guys so I'm
going to be choosing two winners all you
got to do is let me know in the comments
if you were stranded on a desert island
a deserted island or a desert whichever
and you were stranded on an island which
one of these guys would you take if you
can only take one would it be foundation
or would it be eye shadows you already
know my answer let me know in the
comments I will be letting you know in
two weeks on snapchat all the details
will be below and without further ado
let's get on with the tutorial I just
got in last night from out of town and
usually when I come in from out of town
I'm kind of tired for some reason I
always get the flights that are later in
the night so I come home like when it's
already dark outside it's really late
and I was just really tired my skin was
tired but I had to get something on my
face I was going to bring it back to
life because I don't like going to sleep
when my skin just feels kind of nasty so
I used this epicenter national hydrating
mask and you leave it on for like 20 15
to 20 minutes and then it just like
rehydrates your face so I tried it out
last night and it worked really well I
just like laid in bed for 15 to 20
minutes and did nothing and it felt so
good just to relax there for a minute I
washed it off and then I went to bed and
actually woke up today feeling a lot my
skin feels a lot better I did that last
night and then today I'm going to try
another moisturizer this one's from the
hip C glam bag the BIOS aunts the
revitalizer and it's like a liquid form
it comes in a little droplet and
you just put it on your face and neck
and your says to use it morning and
night so I decided to use it today
before I started my makeup I usually
like to do like uh some type of
moisturizer before I start my foundation
I'll normally use like a hydrating
primer or I'll use just like a
moisturizer for your face when your skin
is moisturized your your makeups going
to apply a lot smoother and it's just
gonna look a lot better I have been
using this primer for about a month and
I absolutely love it this one's from
Murad it's the invisiblur perfecting
shield what I love about it is that it
makes your skin look really smooth and
it makes your makeup just glide on so
evenly I'm in love with this primer it's
so funny because I've had it for like a
little while but I never would think to
use something from your ad for like
makeup or like a primer but I was like
I'm going to try it out and it works
really really good so if you have like
oily skin or if you have blemish prone
skin and you're looking for a primer
definitely try this one out it's so good
and your foundation is going to look
super flawless underneath it and then
I'll go in with this foundation right
here this is the Tarte rainforest of the
sea foundation and it's their water
foundation I change my foundations so
often just because I like to try a new
one I use it pretty often this is one of
my top foundations that I do use and I'm
actually giving away with to you guys
I'm super excited for one of you guys to
be getting this what I'll do is take my
wet Beauty Blender and this is new by
the way so it feels so good to use like
a new Beauty Blender but my fingers just
got on it so ignore the spots but I'm
going to just dab my Beauty Blender on
my hand and then I'll just go and work
in the foundation along my face and I
like this foundation because it's not
heavy on your skin it feels really light
and it still covers really well and I
always make sure to blend the foundation
down to my neck so that everything looks
even and it just matches and the Beauty
Blender is one of my
favorite tools to put foundation on
because it soaks up all the excess
foundation and it just goes on even more
evenly and then for the concealer I use
the NARS medium custard I just put that
underneath my eyes really close to the
inner corners and I just use a smaller
part of my Beauty Blender to get into
the inner corners and just Pat it in
there
and then work it outwards and then to
contour a little bit I'll just use my
makeup forever Foundation stick and this
is in Y 505 I'll use it on my nose like
right here along the side and then right
along the cheekbone then use this Smith
220 brush to buff it in
so I just finished doing my brows if you
guys want to see a brow routine video go
ahead and leave a comment below there's
just a bunch of steps that I do with my
brows right now so let me know if you
want to see what those steps are so now
I'm just going to go ahead and start
brightening my under eyes to do that and
use my Kat Von D shade light palette
this highlighter right here is so full
coverage and brightens up so much I'm
just in love with it it's my ultimate
favorite under eye brightener so I'm
using this shade right here and I mix a
little bit of the yellow shades Pat it
right underneath the eye go all the way
down alongside the nose and then bring
it back up towards the top of the
cheekbone I also like to use the
leftover powder on the lid just so that
it helps with studying everything in
place and the eyeshadow will glide on a
lot easier that way I like my under eyes
to be pretty bright because naturally
they're just so dark so I like to go in
with brightening powders all my
brightening powders are matte I like to
keep eyeliners right at the cheekbone
further up here and I'll just bring it
around the mouth where the dark areas
are turned at the corners and right on
the mustache area if you have a lot of
texture on your skin and you want to
highlight your skin but you don't want
reflective properties on it then you
want to go ahead and use a matte
brightening powder on the t-zone so you
still get the brightening effect without
the shimmer I'm just going to take a
little bit of the contouring powder it's
this first one I'll just put a little
bit more on the near the tip of the nose
I'm just taking a little bit of the
contour powder that we used on our nose
and I'm using it really close to the ear
in the hairline
and I'm stopping it right there and then
with a clean brush I'm just going to
buff it out
and then for my eyes when you use this
Too Faced chocolate bonbon palette right
here it's a really cute palette I'm
going to go in with the almond truffle
shade right here and just buff it into
my crease
so pretty I'm going to take cashew chew
and I put that on my lid I'm going to
take a little bit of mocha and work that
onto the outer crease and I'm going to
wet the tip of this brush right here and
I'm going to dip my brush into satin
sheets this shade is so pretty
I'm going to use it for my inner corner
highlight but I figured you'd pop even
more with a wet brush so I'm going to
put it right on the inner corners and
then I'm going to take the Verona Mona
eye smudger brush and I'm going to work
this into the lower part of the lash
line then I'm just going to go in with
this bronzer duo in aruba looks like
this and I'm just going to work it into
both of the shade and then for my lips
I'm going to take the Mac boldly bare
lip pencil and align my lips fold them
in
then for the lipstick I'm going to use
the Neutrogena moisture stick in all men
nude now I'm going to go back into the
eyes I'm going to go ahead and take my
Kat Von D tattoo liner and make a wing
and apply some lashes and mascara
so just did my wing and now I'm just
going to put on some of this Smashbox
x-rated mascara before I apply my lashes
I'm going to go ahead and set my makeup
in place so I'm going to use the creamy
powder foundation from Tarte this is in
medium natural hat my powder into my
skin this also gives a really nice full
coverage as well so if you're looking
for more covered at the same time your
makeups not going to move thank you guys
