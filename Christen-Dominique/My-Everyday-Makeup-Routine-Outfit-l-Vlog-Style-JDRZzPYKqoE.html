before I walk in today I'm wearing this
kind of chilly out here which is rare
but kind of cool cuz I like being in the
cold weather this is from forever 21
it's super cute it has these little
pleats on it and these pockets and then
I'm wearing this top from Windsor and
it's just cut out flowers and it's
sleeveless so I think I'll actually be
changing but yet I'm wearing this and
then I have on these distressed cropped
jeans from fashion Nova and I have my
forever 21 pointed and was going to wear
some really cute bold sandals today but
I was like no it's way too cold and it
change into this shirt is just a cropped
white long sleeve tee so I'll be right
back I'm going to go change
so much better now that my arms are
covered now I'm going to go and walk
into the studio so you guys oh and also
every time I come to film I always bring
my big bag so I put all my makeup in
there and like an outfit that I'm
wearing today so it's really good to
have a big bag when I come filmed this
is my studio you guys are this is my
little set you guys sent it before in my
other videos and this is my film um I
have my makeup right here and it's
exciting today because I'm using this
new foundation for to face and I have
all of the shades right here because I'm
trying to find my color I'm doing a
giveaway on this channel today I'm
giving away these to face foundations to
you guys so I'm excited about that and
they're very new they came out today
today is the 25th and I'll be posting
this video tomorrow so you guys will see
it on Wednesday will stay Tuesday
Wednesday and yeah so we're about to
film let's get started just took a
snapchat thumbs up if you follow me on
snapchat
follow me I hope every second almost
every second of my life if there's
something going on even when there's
nothing going on I'm just kind of bored
I'll post whatever so it's Kristin snaps
right I'll be right for my primer today
if you follow me on snapchat you know
that I love this primer I use it pretty
much every day it's very hydrating
coconut water is more hydrating than
actual water and then I'm going to use
the Too Faced Born This Way I'm choosing
the sand color right here it's really
pretty packaging too they always have
the cutest packaging and this is full
coverage and oil free so I was going to
put on with my fingers but I'm not I
don't know why I did that
luckily they have you could remove your
wipes the foundation brush today I'm
using is from Sheba this is the 104
buffer brush you
I'll just supply with that
use the naked skin from urban decay I
feel like I don't really need to make an
introduction for this because I use it
so much I'm just gonna cover my
under-eye circles and then highlight
with this
I hid my under-eye circles and I've
highlighted so now I'm just going to do
my brows while all of this dries for my
brows I'm using the honest Asya pomade
in ash brown this eyebrow is a lot
different from this one
so I do tend to take a little bit more
time on this one but it's just to even
it out and they don't have to look
identical because they are shaped
differently just as long as that brow is
even by the time I finish my brows my
powder my foundation has set now I'm
going to just go over with my powder the
powder I use is from urban decay this is
a really good one and this is the Naked
Skin ultra definition powder foundation
and this is in the color medium neutral
I like using this powder because it is
also like a foundation but it's in
powder form so it gives you even more
coverage I was gonna I was actually
going to name this video my natural
everyday makeup look but definitely not
natural for everyone this is my natural
I don't know I'm going to have a winged
eyeliner in there so I don't know what
you want to call that but I know a lot
of people for a lot of people natural is
very minimal so I think I'm going to
just say this is my everyday makeup
because it is my everyday makeup next
I'm going to brighten my under eyes and
for that I'm using my Kat Von D shade
light I have these three awesome under
eye brightener or highlighters they're
all matte so I just go underneath my
eyes and it sets in the concealer and
also brightens up the under eyes
I was using the flat shader brush for a
while but for my contour this one from
zoeva the 109 face paint brush but now
I've been using the 109 oh my god they
have the same number oh that's crazy
this is the 109 for Mac totally
different brushes though this one is
more dome shaped and it's smaller so I
feel like it gets into those areas a lot
easier I'm going to use the middle
contour shade right here and go right
along the cheekbone I like my cheekbones
to look a little bit higher so I do it a
little bit above the cheekbone but you
can feel it with your finger you just
put it right underneath your cheekbone
and that's where your contour should go
and then I bring it around the hairline
and around the forehead and then for the
sides of my nose I'll use a smaller
fluffy brush this is the crease brush
from zoeva it's the 221 taking the same
color and just running it along this
side of the nose I'm gonna use the same
brush I'm going to just sweep it across
my crease I'm going to take the same
color and run it along the lower part of
the lash line this is like the first
shadow that I'm creating and then I'll
do a little bit underneath the eyes very
close to the lash line and I can do my
entire face with just highlighting
contour C it's very minimal you can't
really even tell unless you look really
close but that's fine this is it's going
to work really well at the end you'll be
able to see the gradient and after
that's done my highlight my contour now
I go straight into the eye then I'm
going to take this bronzer this one is
from Make Up For Ever this is the pro
bronze fusion and it's in the number 251
and they're very creamy and smooth so
I'm going to take this one with a
smaller tapered fluffy brush the zoeva
luxe to find crease brush
is the 2:24 taking some of that bronze
color has I got orange undertone to it
so it gives you that glowing effect and
I'm just going to sweep it back and
forth along the crease in the same area
as the first color just below the first
color that we used but when it comes to
really getting the color payoff and
blending it upwards the two the 239
brush works for me the best so I'm
taking this lighter color here and I'm
placing it right in the crease and kind
of outlining where I want it to be and
then blending it upwards
so I'm going to show you guys up close
now that I'm at the darkest color that
I'm using I'm using this one right here
get right at the base of the crease and
just set the color down along the crease
and once I have the amount that I want
then I'll flip my brush over to the
cleanest side and sweep it upwards
towards the brow bone I'm going to take
the vanilla shade from the shade light
palette and we'll place it right on the
lid now I'm going to take a bottle being
into any dark brown you have preferably
matte this is the one I had on hand just
to accentuate the outer crease a little
bit more and add some depth there and
then that's the end of the eyeshadow
look super easy
you actually can skip this part if you
don't want that extra definition on the
outer crease maybe any matte Brown you
can take and that's going to be the last
color you use to really get the
definition in your crease and then for
my highlight I'll just go back into my
contour palette and I let my problem
I'll just Pat it where I want it using
the yellow color because I usually like
how the yellow undertone looks on my
skin and I'm just going to work the
color downwards and to the other ones
nice and clean and then that's pretty
much it I'll do my eyeliner and I'm
gonna do my wing with my matte makeup
forever makeup over eyeliner and this
dries matte which is nice
like that and for a mascara I'm using
the Tarte lights camera lashes some time
with my mascara and now I'm putting on
my lashes the lashes i normally use are
from foxy locks and they're called the
perfect lash and I'll have a link below
because those are my favorite I don't
have them today these are Beauty divas
sisters a style jasmine right here I
usually try to go for something that is
kind of PC so that you can see your eye
shape and your eye makeup that still
give you a little bit of length and
drama when they're close together like
this I feel like it takes away from my
eye shape it makes it look a little too
heavy even though they're kind of thin
it's a thin layer of lash I'm going to
try it out if it doesn't look right I'm
not going to wear it I'm going to try it
that's not too bad it is kind of full on
the lash line and I think it'll work
so I'm going to use these and for my
highlight I'm going to use the Gerard
cosmetics star powder in Marilyn
for my blush I like to use something
that's very natural just is like a flush
of color on my cheeks so I usually use
the Park Avenue princess contour palette
and since this blush color right here
and then I sweep it right in between the
highlight and the contour so it should
marry those colors together use
something that's very nude or I don't
even use lipstick I'll use a chopstick
of some kind today I'm going to use
skimpy it's a nude color and this is the
final look I hope you guys enjoyed the
