single day on my face and this is a look
that I do make sure you're a part of the

let's get into why hello there oh I'm
very out of put boo this is cool I just
got a new camera so it's the 5d Mark 4
and it autofocuses you guys I'm so
excited about this every time I get out
of photos in like say Zack stays oh jeez
like he never hears me sign up to scream
your name five times it's 7:00 in the
morning I have my coffee it's giving me
compliments I think I'm ready to do this
I can put this in my hair or keep my
hair out of my face whoo it matches my
shirt look at me matching today oh this
is cute oh my god that is adorable
I have my makeup and this is like a bag
right here this is my first Zuka bag
I've ever had and I love it if it's
everything this is the makeup that I use
every single day as you can tell because
it looks a little loved you know inside
the primer that I've been using is this
Smashbox primer that's kind of dirty my
contour palette broke this is the
contour palette that I absolutely adore
I love it so much
I use it every single day and it's like
thank the heavens it only broke the
parts that I don't use we still have the
rest of the important parts of the
palette my skin is still very dry I
don't know why but it is so I have been
using this Smashbox photo-finish
hydrating primer and I mix a lot this in
it's from Make Up For Ever it came look
like a
big box of stuff but because my skin is
so dry right now it's a hydrating serum
so I put I mix this sermon with this
primer and it's beautiful so I'm gonna
go ahead and pop that on my hand squirt
that in there mix it up oh it feels so
good on the skin it just feels like my
skin drink a big glass of water that's
the best description that I have for
this right now I always like to take it
down to my neck because I'm gonna put
makeup on in this area because we're
gonna blend it we want it to match our
the rest of our body I was very into
makeup always and I'm gonna say I was
like seventeen sixteen seventeen I would
blend the makeup all the way to town
like a crazy person like literally why I
would do that the I would always run out
of foundation because I wanted to drench
it all over my body I don't know why for
the foundation I'm going to be using the
make it forever
Ultra HD liquid foundation the most
perfect shade I have ever had in my life
has been this one then make it forever
Ultra HD in Y 335 so if you are my
similar skin tone get yourself some why
335 and you are good to go they have
this in the stick form as well so we are
going to go ahead and use this it makes
it look a lot more hydrated it just
makes it look healthier and this has
really been doing the job for me so I'm
just working that into my skin bouncing
it bounce bounce bone I've been using
the brow is from Anastasia in medium
brown and then the precisely my brow
pencil and number six to go on the
bottom of the brow I don't know why I
think it's a great combo it's just me I
want to show you guys a little snippet
of what I do to my brows so let's go go
in there and sketch through them I just
follow the natural flow of the brow fill
in the sparse areas and enhance the the
tail because basically I have no tail
end of my brow I feel like it's not even
there like I have a little tadpole
I'll brush up and then I will hold it
like this and brush through the brow and
then I take this one right here this is
the precisely my brow pencil from
benefit and I go right underneath the
bottom of it lightly just brushing
through the bottom this is just to
enhance the shape of the brow ever since
I got this NARS soft matte complete
concealer this has been part of my
routine ever since the moment that I
grabbed it and put it on my face so I'm
just gonna clean up my brow so I'm gonna
go ahead and take the meet matrimony
palette and I am using Matt Lin we're
gonna use him first I'm actually kind of
happy that these are guy names because I
always call my shadows and makeup
products him or her it makes sense now
so I'm going to take Matt lid I'm going
to pop them all over my eyelid to set
and neutralize the eye and we're going
to take that all the way up to the brow
bone so start in the inner corners all
the way down to the end of the lid
crease up to the brow I'm gonna go into
the crease my crease brush that I've
been using every single day is the Luxy
231 this has something orange on it so
I'm going to clean it right now give me
a second thank God for this brush
cleaner I cleaned all my brushes
yesterday with it and it just cleans
them up so fast this is the it's your
brush love from a cosmetics so this
works really really good to get off if
you want to change the color it gets it
off like so quick it just slips right
off the brush okay we are back to Norman
I'm going to take Matt Lopez and I'm
going to run him through the crease so
I'm going to start out here so I'm just
doing circular motions out here I like
to just use back and forth windshield
wiper motions when I get closer to the
inner corner so we're going back and
forth like this but you may have to use
different motions on your eye because we
all have different skin folds on our
eyelids so use what feels best to you
you can either do windshield wiper and
that's just this mo
right here circular motions for the
outer part of the crease because there
isn't very much folding there so it's
easy for me to blend like this so just
kind of find your own little groove of
things and that's when your blending
will get better and something that's
going to help you on blending is using a
light hand and sometimes it's hard not
to kind of get in there and get like
this close but when you're doing that
that's gonna put a lot of pressure on
your brush which makes blending a lot
more difficult keep your hand on the
back of the brush so you have a lot of
room to kind of move it around so many
is a little bit of Matt Kumar and a
little bit of Matt Reed kind of mix them
together and pop them into the crease so
I'm coming in a little bit heavier
handed towards the end of the crease
because I want that part to be the
darkest and then I just soften up
towards the inner part of the crease so
I go back and forth like this
so I'm gonna go in with the smaller
brush this is the morphe M 507 this is
the perfect for me it's my perfect
crease brush like right when you want to
get that dark color in the crease this
is the brush that I like using and I'm
mixing Matt Wazowski with Matt Reed and
we're going to focus that on the outer
part of the crease only
I'm going to go back in to Matt Lana to
really enhance that lid color so I'm
going to take a 234 brush from zoeva
going to pack that on top of the lid
while you're there you can kind of
soften up the edge of the crease color
I'm just going to touch the brow bone a
little bit with this color and bring it
down when I have a winged liner picture
up on my Instagram everyone asked what
eyeliner is it and it's this one it's
because it's super super dark this is
the hardest double-take eyeliner I've
already use this side done the pencil
that was dark too but I'm using this
side right here this is a liquid liner
part so I'm just going to go ahead and
do a quick little winged liner now I'm
going to go ahead and pop on some
mascara and some lashes using my Marc
Jacobs mascara I go back and forth
between two lashes goddess from Lily
lashes and now the House of lashes
iconic light I'm gonna go ahead and pop
those on and I will be right okay so I
just put on my lashes now I'm gonna go
into the rest of my face concealer
because I just want to cover up my
under-eye circles I'm going to use the
Tarte shape tape this is it's the coffee
trust me I don't know what's going on
with me pop that underneath my eyes
and everywhere else on my face
I'm also going to use the radiant creamy
concealer in 10 L because I am out of
light medium and I use light neutral it
is a little bit too light so I wasn't
seeing these two together
actually this is customer we're going to
go ahead and pop that right on top and
blend it in and now we are going to
contour our face I'm going to use the
Make Up For Ever contour stick I mean
this is not I made this my contour stick
this from Smith it's the Smith 220 I'm
going to take that on this little brush
and we are going to contour our cheeks
now I'm going to set my under eyes with
the shade and light contour palette now
I'm going to bronze up my face I'm going
to use the NARS Laguna bronzer just to
warm up my cheeks and give my face some
color I'm going to take that around the
temple then I'm going to lightly blend
it right in the center but not not going
to go too hard because I don't want
helmet bronzer for highlight I've been
using the double glean from Mac dicey
gling gling I'm just going to pop that
onto my cheekbones Cupid's bow for the
lips I've been using oak to line my lips
and after oak I'll go in with cream
denude this shade right here from Mac as
you can see I have overall over the rim
and I have been using that lately it's
kind of like my combo and that is my
every single day makeup routine thank
