hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today I'm gonna be showing you my
everyday makeup routine right here on my
face all my faves is what I'm gonna be
using the only thing that is new here is
the k'kaw concealers and I had to try
them and I used the whole 3-step system
so it is on my face right now
I will tell you how I feel about them in
just a little bit but if you want to see
how I got this look right here don't
forget to subscribe to my channel and
hit that notification bell so you can be
a part of the quad family I without
further ado let's get on with the video
my second time worrying press-on nails
so if one falls off cuz two already fell
off just pretend like it didn't happen
I forgot how much I love this stuff from
Wet n Wild this is the ultimate brow kit
it is so bomb you guys when you do your
brows with a powder it looks a little
bit more natural and it's just easier
that's what I've been doing more
recently so I'll just get this medium
shade right here and then I'll use the
darker shade for the tail end because if
you go a little bit too close it looks
crazy
alright so brows are done it now I'm
going to prime my face to make sure
everything is smooth I'm gonna go ahead
and use the Itachi basalt canvas primer
so it looks like this I really like that
it's this like pancake form and usually
dip your finger in there very old-school
so I'm just gonna dot it on lightly and
just press it into the skin I feel like
my skin has been really you know it's
been pretty good it's not breaking out
too bad and then I just said that like
last week and then this week I have
breakouts all over my chin my forehead
oh know what's going on and then for
foundation I really really love this
L'Oreal infallible Pro matte foundation
it has a demi matte finish and it's 24
hour
dip my Beauty Blender this is a new one
this makes me so happy when I have a
fresh clean new Beauty Blender it just
makes my heart so happy so I'm just
gonna dip a little bit onto the Beauty
Blender
and then work it into my skin this is by
the way this is the shade of a Sun beige
but I also sometimes mix in a natural
beige which is something that I need to
do right now because Sun beige is like
that's the color that I use when I am
just finished self-tanning but once it's
worn off I definitely have to put a
little bit of this other color in there
so I'm just gonna work that on my skin
look how good it covers all the redness
and zits are gone and I barely just
tapped the Beauty Blender on there this
is my foundation beard for my eyes I'm
gonna use the Dominique Lotte palette I
use it every single day just like colors
that you can use all the time so I'm
going to take caramel in hazelnut and
I'm gonna put them on the inner and
outer corners lately I have been loving
halo eyes I think they're just so pretty
and easy so I'm just gonna grab this
brush right here from Mac it's the two
17's brush and I'm gonna put that on the
inner and outer part of my eye and I
just use the foundation as a base
instead of the concealer it's just
quicker and easier and it kind of just
flows into my routine so I end up using
that like on a daily basis but if I'm
doing a youtube video for some reason I
only do like concealer on the lid I
don't know why I feel like it's a little
bit more extra and it really just makes
the colors super stand out but I want a
daily basis I'm a basic B so this is
what I do
I set most of the color on the sides
like this and then once I put down
enough then I'll just flip my brush over
and kind of move it further away from
the crease this so it's more gradual and
there's no harsh edges and it's only one
brush so it's super easy and that's
basically all I do and I use the same
brush to layer on a darker color so
that's like my base and I'll do the same
thing on the other eye of course next
I'm gonna take a double shot really
reddish purple shade right here one of
my favorite pops of color in the palette
that I always end up using
so I'm gonna put that right on top and
I'm gonna let those other shades that we
put on before peek through the next
color I'm going to take is the darkest
one in the palette and that is mocha
with the same brush I know you guys this
is a true everyday routine because I use
the same brush for like ten different
colors and it's fine it works out good
and put that on the outer corners as
well just to deepen up the look and all
I do is just layer these colors on top
of each other with but at the same time
make space so that each colors peeks
through just a little bit so you get
that natural looking gradient and I'm
using this fluffy brush from the makeup
shock it's the t67 and I'm just gonna go
over super soft over the edges just go
back and forth or you do circular
whatever style of blending it wants and
I'm trying to keep this pretty clean but
it's okay because we're gonna just pop
over like a foil a shimmery shadow
anyway so it's all good I just love the
way that purple and brown look together
it gives it such a unique look so pretty
so now that I have that I pop on a foil
so I'm gonna take macchiato in the
middle
I love macchiato as a highlight it's
such a beautiful highlight I can
honestly use this whole palette and I've
used it before like all the colors for
my face and my eyes it's supposed to be
a multi-purpose palette with like pops
of color right here so what I'll do is
just take it on my finger and it'll pop
it right in the center and this is a
very pigmented almost wet kind of
eyeshadow it's like a shimmery foil and
we're just gonna pop it in the center
like that and it looks crazy but don't
worry you blend out the edges and those
of you who have your dominique palette
that makes my heart so happy I know I
hope you're enjoying it we're having fun
with it don't forget to use it on your
face on your eyes on your body on your
hair just kidding you don't use it on
your hair that's not that's not what
it's used for but I definitely use it
all over on other places then I just use
this fluffy brush it's the same fun I
use I've usually I literally use two
brushes the entire time that's it I'm
very minimal when it comes to like an
everyday
so then I'm just gonna take it and go
back and forth on the top to blend out
the harshness I'm gonna get those edges
once I have the foil on my eye I just
drop this everywhere I love these little
pal well I don't know if to call it a
pallet or not it's a very unique case
with multiple things in it this is from
Hank and Henry the brand it is such such
a cute package and at the same time it
has so you can do eyeshadow it's a matte
eyeshadow there's a pressed pearl shadow
and then on the bottom it's a loose
pearl right here I think it's such a
beautiful and very genius little palette
so I'm going to take this guy right here
it's so pretty this is the shade El Jefe
and this is called luster lights pop it
right on there because it has more of
that loose glitter in it so and for the
lower lash line I'm just gonna grab the
same brush that you've been using this
entire time and because it's flat you
see how I can turn it around and it's
super flat so I'm just gonna turn it on
this side right here and go back and
forth right on the lower lash line and I
love that it doesn't go anywhere further
than this it just kind of stays right
where you put it which is perfect and it
has all those shades in it so you can
see like all the different shades in
there and you don't even really have to
try so for the upper and lower lash line
just a little bit on the lower lash line
I'm going to take this L'Oreal
infallible Pro last liner and it's a
pencil it's super creamy it glides on
like a dream and it's very very
pigmented
you barely late it's like BAM you got
black paint on your eye I've done so
many tutorials where I do my like
everyday look and it always includes a
winged liner but lately I've just been I
don't know I've just been all about the
like quick and easy kind of look I also
really like to use this on the waterline
because it smudge resistant so it
doesn't really get anywhere
also kind of stays put it doesn't run on
you or anything like that it's super
pigmented I just love the L'Oreal pencil
and before I put on lashes I'm just
gonna prime my lashes and coat them with
a little bit of mascara I'm gonna be
using the l'oreal voluminous superstar X
fiber and it has two different sides
which is really cool so the first side
is to prime your eyes and it also has a
color in it it has a really cool curvy
wand to create volume so with this first
one you're just really lifting the lash
and getting them really nice and plump
and I'm also gonna just coat my lower
lashes too while we're here so now I'm
gonna do this step two which is the
fiber infused mascara and this is going
to give you a ton more volume and I'm
really just gonna focus this on the
lower lashes because I'm gonna put false
lashes on the top so we're just gonna
coat them a little bit and then really
focus this on the lower lashes I like my
lower lashes to look really long and
full we're gonna all that length I love
it I love that you can get volume and
lengthen each one is specific to that so
I really really like this mascara now
I'm just gonna pop on the lashes and the
lashes I'm using are from obsessed I'm
using them again because they're kind of
awesome and this is the style dreamy for
the inner corners I'm gonna take vanilla
cream on this tiny little brush right
here from the makeup Shack it's the T 58
I'll put that in my inner corners just
to brighten it up right there and since
we have a lot of shimmer and we have
these loose glitter pearls or these
loose pearls I'm just gonna keep it
pretty matte and bright on the inner
corners so I'm gonna take this shade
right and also use this shade to just
blend out any harsh lines you have right
in here okay I'm really really excited
about this next part because I'm going
to be using the k'kaw new concealers and
I have these three shades right here
because I'm not really sure I'm probably
like in between these two ish so I'm
gonna test out which one is going to
work for me but I really like her
packaging it's really pretty and sleek
I'm gonna go ahead and first do a number
6 and just swatch it
my arm it looks like a little liquid lip
that's cute I'm gonna swatch that okay
that's definitely too dark it's number
eight but it's lighter yeah definitely
number four these are very pigmented so
I'm gonna take number four like so so
I'm gonna take it right on the inner
corners ok this is really bright
I could actually contour with these but
I don't have the contour color so I want
them to a friend I'm gonna take this
right here a little facelift trick in
case you guys has a saggy mouth go ahead
and lift it up you don't have a saggy
mouth and I'm gonna mix a little bit of
eight in there which is really weird
because I feel like this should be like
a really dark shade but it really isn't
so I'm gonna just pop it right in the
middle I'm gonna leave the the center
bright because that's what I'm trying to
do there and blend it all in so I'm
gonna take my damp Beauty Blender and
I'm gonna use the baking powders as
number two looks like so I'll just pack
it underneath I'm also gonna go right
here I'm gonna let that set
well that's setting into my face I'm
gonna go ahead and contour I use the
same contour palette it's the shaded
light contour palette from Kat Von D and
since I always do that I'm just gonna go
through my contour really quick so I'm
gonna wipe away all the bait usually
people use the baking method when
they're putting on eyeshadow so that you
don't get it fall out on your face and
it just kind of rolls off the extra
powder but I really like to do this to
soften the under eyes so that there
isn't any lines and that's what I use
baking for now she also has another
another step which is to brighten with a
pressed powder this is my favorite color
to brighten wait I actually have it in
my palette as well so I'm going to use
the zoeva 114 brush and just work that
right on top of the dark spots and
supposedly this is what she does for her
routine for her like concealing and
contouring kind of routine so anything
camber
and HUDs on her face I definitely want
to try because she is full Allah seek
thee take me take home the bronze from
the bomb and this has been kind of my
go-to bronzer and I'll just use that on
my cheeks like so and on my temple just
to give me that bronzy glow for the
highlight I'm gonna use the Oprah feel
in myself I mainly use blissful which is
this one right here so for the lips I'm
gonna be using this new color pop X Ava
this is the my life my laughs is Ava
this is the my life as Ava collab it's
an ultra blotted lip in the shade love
bite it's a really pretty Mabi
kind of pinky nude it's just very satiny
feeling on the lips it's cushiony and
very very matte alright and that is the
final
thank you guys for watching I hope you
enjoyed this video and if you did go
ahead and give me a big thumbs up and
