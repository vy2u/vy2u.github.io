new la home so today I'm going to show
you my current everyday makeup look plus
an outfit we did
left you're hot when it comes to makeup
on a daily basis I prefer to look as
natural and fresh as possible I usually
start off with filling in the sparse
areas of my brows and currently I'm
using this dark brown shadow from one of
my next palettes and applying it with an
angled liner brush rising up to you
there's nothing I can do
all right so now it's time to transform
this dark circles into one nice even
skin tone magic right thanks to
concealer all things are possible
well sort of now it's time to give
myself some color I just grabbed a
slightly warmer colored powder and
dusted all over my face mainly focusing
it on the outer part of my face and my
neck then I follow up with a lighter
colored powder to brighten up my skin
and add it tad bit more of coverage to
any areas that I'd like
now I'm rising in front and now we're
here at my prep stage I just softened my
lips with an EOS balm and fleuret my
lashes here we are at the staple of my
look that's my winged liner and thumbs
up for any other girls who are in love
with this staple
can you
so Jones again do this again again oh
yeah so Jones again alright girls I
found the next best thing since yes it's
mascara this is an amazing mascara just
watch see pretty cool right now I'm just
adding a flush of natural pink color to
my cheeks here I'm sleeping on the next
blusher in the color dare and then to
add some brightness to my eyes I'll add
a shimmer color to the inner corners it
helps give me a fresh-faced appearance
and lastly I glide on a light pink color
to my lips and that's it
I'm out and ready for the day what's
your everyday look show me below by
leaving a video response I'd love to see
I hope you enjoyed this video as much as
I enjoyed making it for you and until
the next time I don't that my devil
stole turkey so long well
I shook the angel and yeah
