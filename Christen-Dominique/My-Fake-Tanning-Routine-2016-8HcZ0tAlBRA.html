going to be showing you my tanning
routine from start to finish and I
promise I am NOT naked I'm wearing a
tank top I only have concealer and lip
gloss in my brows on right now this is
different usually I have a full face of
makeup but today it's all about the tan
so I decided I'm going to skip on the
makeup today so today I'm going to be
taking you through my self-tanning
routine and I am going to be using Vita
Liberata this dry oil which is amazing
it smells so good those gonna help tan
your skin but at the same time it's
going to give you that protection from
the Sun because it is an SPF 50 which is
insane it just makes me feel like my
skin looks healthier I feel thinner it's
like a full body contour I remember in
high school and my only goal beauty wise
was to be super tan I mean I was
insanely dark and I loved it I would go
to the tanning bed all the time and it
was very unhealthy Hanning beds are no
good and stay away from them stop going
to the tanning bed and started using
self tan products it's a lot healthier
for you I'm naturally pretty light my
mom's very light so I have to channel a
lot because I like looking tan so if you
are thinking about getting a nice
healthy tan I would suggest you do a
self tanner like this one I'm going to
show you my routine on tanning and let's
get straight anning routine starts off
with a shower I like to start with clean
skin you want to make sure that your
skin is even as possible so using a
loofah or a bathing sponge is really
good to help smooth out your skin also
shaving is really helpful and plus you
want to shave anyways just so that you
don't have any hairs on your legs and
then I also exfoliate with an actual
exfoliator with beads in it to really
remove the dead skin from around my
elbows and just creases of my body so
that the tan doesn't sit in those lines
so after I get out of the shower I like
to use a lotion and apply it on my
wrists my ankles any part of my body
that would Bend I like to put it there
just so that the tanning product doesn't
get stuck in that area and doesn't get
blotchy and
this is when your hands can tend to look
very orange and voluma like so using a
lotion to block it out really really
helps make your tan look even and smooth
so now I'm going to go ahead and add
some color to my skin I'm going to use
the Vita Liberata phenomenal tanning
mousse I usually do about two to three
pumps into my mitt and then work it into
circular motions on my legs using a very
light hand around my joints around my
knees my ankles and my wrists even
though we've done everything we can to
prevent blotchiness you still want to
just be careful around those areas and
use a very light hand I also like to use
a light hand around the decollete area
if you have protruding collarbones just
go ahead like I do I just go ahead and
push your shoulder back and it kind of
flattens everything out and makes it a
little bit more easier to get an even
tan so we get to the wrist I like to use
like a dusting motion kind of feather
like pressure around the area so it
doesn't get into the knuckles and then
go back into the circular motions around
the large part of the arm and then when
you get to the elbow you're just going
to use a light hand to really make sure
that there isn't any blotchiness I go
ahead and take a brush and just blend
everything out around the joints for the
face I use a very small amount of tanner
on this brush and then I just dot it on
my face and blend it out you want to
really be careful around your mouth and
your under eyes if you have a darker
under eyes it's kind of stay clear of
this area also don't forget your ears
and blend it down into your neck just
like your foundation
now it's time to wait for the tangent
developed during this time I like to
grab a magazine watch a show I'm
actually I'm so trying to be as careful
as I can because I do have all white
couches but it's okay because I have
this robe on so it's all good but I have
been obsessed with orange is the new
black so I am watching that right now
I'm just going to relax and chill until
this tan develops so it's day number two
I took a shower this morning washed off
the bronzer and now I have a nice base
tan I'm going to top it off with these
bitola Barada at three and one self-tan
dry oil and SPF 50 I love this oil
because it doesn't give you it's not
oily it's very dry like it says and it
just easily gives you an instant radiant
tan and it's going to also protect you
from UVB and UVA rays the SPF is 50 so
it's very high it's going to give you a
lot of protection and it's a gradual
long lasting sunless tan which is
amazing you can pick this up at Sephora
and I'm very happy with it I know you're
gonna love it and after I'm done I like
to break dance do the broken robot you
know just the usual dorkiness thank you
