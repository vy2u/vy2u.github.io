coming home from the studio on a weekday
I almost called it work but it just
feels really weird calling what I do
work because it doesn't feel like work
to me at all I first like to grab some
comfortable clothes to change into and
honestly I would take my makeup off
right after this that I totally forgot
to do it in that order so we're just
going to go with it and just a warning
to you guys now there's going to be a
lot of candle lighting in this video
because I am that crazy candle lady
I love candle scents I feel like they're
so comforting especially for the Fall
I love those cozy pumpkin scents and
here I'm just watching some TV with my
Jayden and it's usually his favorite and
I'm not gonna lie I enjoy watching it
too the Disney Channel in so many ways
guys I am still such a kid and Here I am
lighting my pumpkin I told you a wax
scent to have this one on for the rest
of the night so that the living room has
a nice cozy scent and don't worry I
turned off the peach one so now I'm
going to Jaden's room and we just have
some playtime so here I am just messing
up his toys and after that I go ahead
and put him to bed and I read him a
bedtime story yes I hop into bed with
him because I got to be comfortable too
and so I read him a story but he also
reads to me so we go back and forth with
that he dreams I love you and lamps am
gonna have a good day at school tomorrow
yeah okay
now I'm just gonna head over to my
restroom put up my hair and take off
these lashes I can't tell you how good
that feels and to remove my makeup today
I'm using their real remover from
benefit and honestly I was out of my
makeup wipes so I found this and I'm not
complaining because it took my eye crazy
eye makeup off so easy so I'm glad I had
that and I use one cotton swab for each
eye because I feel like there's so much
on there that my face needs a totally
different cotton swab and after I'm done
cleaning my face I like to wash my hands
off so I am super excited to use my
pumpkin pecan waffle hand wash I bought
like six of them from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
there's so many really good fall
fragrances and to clean my face I am
using my polished choice clear pore
normalizing cleanser and I've been using
this one for a while actually have a
whole video dedicated to my acne routine
for this currently my favorite go-to
facial cleanser next I'm using the pixie
glow tonic I don't use this every night
maybe twice a week but it's so soothing
and it I don't know if it really does
anything for my skin but it smells
really good and it feels really good so
I continue to use it it just feels like
a burst of fresh air being blown onto
your face when you put this on it's so
refreshing to hydrate my skin I use the
Cetaphil moisturizing I normally just
slather a bunch of this stuff all over
my face and neck I let it sit there for
about 20 seconds and then I smooth it in
so that my skin really soaks it up
or toothpaste I'm using the crest to
cinnamon it keeps me in the fall vibes
yes even the inside of my mouth is ready
for fall and I don't make the cutest
faces when I brush my teeth so we can
just move on to the next part of my
routine and before I head to the bedroom
I like to make a sleepytime green tea
this one's from celestial and I just
heat up the water in the microwave and
do I have to go to the steps I think you
guys want to make tea right and then I
just you know what let's just go through
the steps and grab my tea bag dip it in
there until it turns pretty brown and
then I grab some cinnamon and I pour in
some honey I feel like I'm making my own
fall concoction here but lately I've
been doing this just makes me feel so
relaxed and now I'm heading to my
bedroom here I just check my Instagram
and my Twitter see what everybody is up
to look at everybody's beautiful makeup
looks and then I put the phone down and
it's really hard for me not to go back
to it because I'm a little bit addicted
to my my social media but I I don't
touch my phone I just leave it on my
dresser and then I take my pumpkin
candle and light it while I read before
I go to bed I just started doing this I
read before I go to bed I wake up with
less headaches and I feel a lot more
energized in the morning and that's
pretty much it guys thank you so much
