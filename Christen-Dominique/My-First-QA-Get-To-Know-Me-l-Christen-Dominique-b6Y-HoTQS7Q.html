right now I gotta I'm sitting on my tail
right now and it's a little
uncomfortable like oh my god I'm gonna
die hi everyone welcome back to my
channel so today and doing a question
and answer video for you guys I asked
you guys like five videos back and I'm
finally getting to it so let's just jump
into the video totally not going to even
talk about what I'm wearing today I had
no idea what I was going to wear today
so I just put on this onesie first
question is how long have you and your
husband have been married so I have been
married since this amazing it's going on
three years this June 16th and we
actually haven't officially had an
anniversary celebration so this year's
gonna be our first celebration we've
just been so busy in the past few couple
years that we haven't had a chance to
really celebrate and go away together I
like go on a trip or something so we're
gonna be doing that for the first time
this year I'm super excited I don't know
where we're going yet either Fiji Hawaii
or Cabo so we're still planning that but
we've been together for way longer than
that but we've been married for three
years okay my next question is what did
you want to become when you were younger
I wanted to my first passion was singing
I wanted to be a singer um and dancing I
wanted to be basically a performer my
first Idol was Selena I would make my
family get together when they were
together or my parents I'd make them sit
on the couch and I dance and sing with a
hairbrush in front of them I really
wanted to be a singer I was like please
get me in somehow I want to be Selena I
used to listen when I was younger I used
to listen to a lot of like cumbia and
alternative rock which is random but I
still listen to a lot of that so I
wanted to be like a Spanish singer
that's what I wanted to do where did you
buy your PJ's from so these PJ's are
actually a gift from heart they're super
cute I'm so copying you right now heart
I don't even care because they're so
comfortable but I'm not gonna lie I'm
sitting on my tail right now and it's a
little uncomfortable so this question is
from crazy Kay on YouTube it says why
did you start your YouTube and what
inspired you to do so so I've always
wanted to be a makeup artist I started
my channel in 2009 just to comment and
like on other people's videos I was a
big YouTube beauty lover
I watched candy Johnson Dulce candy Rose
but oh Eckstein er was like my very
first youtube person that I rub I'd
watch her at work on my lunch break it
was like an obsession I just learned a
lot of techniques from them as I learned
I finally gained the confidence to
actually put a video out because I
wanted to see what response I'd get on
my makeup because I was such a beginner
but I loved makeup and I wanted to make
other others feel really beautiful so I
started my channel and my first video
was done on my iPhone 3 I think it was
or 2 I just stacked like a bunch of
random boxes up on my computer desk and
I filmed a video on how to make fuller
lips the video is still up the music was
taken down so it's like some random song
on there at the time I only had like 5
makeup products so that's literally all
I could afford at that time yeah so I
used the end of eyeliner you know has
like a smudger tip on it and I used that
to blend the lips the lip products
together so very very beginning I had
like barely anything but I had such a
passion for makeup and beauty then I
started to find a love for editing it
was so random
I watched Cookie Monster and charisma
star TV I saw their videos probably
about 2012 but I was like oh my god this
is so cool you can actually edit too
like a beat or something how do you do
that and Cookie Monster really inspired
me to edit two beats and at the time she
was only like 15 years old and she's
still a youtuber now and she's
absolutely amazing she's very successful
for such a young age and she actually
inspired me to create more creative
videos especially editing TV now I have
a love for it I just love the whole
thing about YouTube I feel like it's an
art within itself so I love it and now
I'm here doing videos for you guys next
question is I just wanted to ask how old
you are because the first time I watched
one of your videos I thought you were
like 17 and then I figured out you have
a son hashtag shocker and it shocks
everyone and I also wanted to know how
much do you spend on beauty products it
seems like you have every single product
on the market lol love your videos thank
you um so thank you for thinking I'm 17
that is awesome I am
I'm 28 I have a seven year old and how
much do I spend on beauty products
hmm it varies from month to month how
much I spend sometimes I spend a bunch
sometimes I don't spend that much
sometimes I'll get products sent to me
so I won't have to spend that much that
month um so yeah I love makeup I'm a
beauty junkie just like you guys Alicia
asked do you have any sisters or
brothers I have I grew up as an only
child but I am I have one half-sister
she lives in San Diego she's around 22
or so and I have another half-sister
from my mother and she lives in Houston
which is where I'm originally from um
and she's four years old and so yeah I
have two half sisters how old were you
when you had your son I was 20 um have
you worn a sari or any Indian outfits
can you please wear one in your video
and do Bollywood tutorials I know your
mom is Indian so my mom and my little
sister sometime though were sometimes
they'll will sometimes they'll wear
saris because they'll they have family
events
my sister is half Indian so they go to a
lot of family events for my stepdads
family and they're Indian so that's when
they're there will wear the saris and
stuff Abigail Reyes asked what's your
ethnicity
my mother is half Mexican
my grandmother is the one who's Arabic
and we know none of her family we just
know who she is and she's always been
with my grandfather which is Mexican so
just know I'm some type of Middle
Eastern my father
I really didn't know too much about my
dad until I was like 15 I know he was
born in Guyana which is in South America
but they consider themselves to be
Portuguese so I'm not really too sure
exactly but I was raised with the
Hispanic side of my family so I feel
like I'm more Spanish
teni took this test we're fit in
something and it tells you like your
whole background so I'm gonna do that
test so I can actually give everyone an
answer because I'm not really sure I
just feel like maybe I'm Hispanic what
do you plan on doing after your
successful makeup career I want to have
a clothing line and I'm gonna have a
beauty brand I want to make really cool
makeup bags and lipsticks and eyelashes
so that's something that I'm thinking
about in the future we share ghost
stories I like this one
I love sharing ghost stories I love
hearing ghost stories I really only have
one and it's so true okay so I was 5
years old
and I still remember it like it was
yesterday I was in my room I look over
to this side and there's these weird
noises next to the window and I was like
what the heck had my bear over my face
like oh my god I'm gonna die and then I
look up and there's these three girls in
there red and their bodies are doing
this not even joke it was a dream it was
very realistic and they were talking to
me and coming closer so I rolled out of
bed and I I crawled on the floor opened
the door and I went to my parents and I
told them I started screaming there's
ghosts in my room I was freaking out and
they went into my room of course there
was no ghosts
and they looked everywhere no ghosts at
all they never came back and it was so
realistic that I mean I'm still I still
remember so vividly who knows what it
was but yeah that's my ghost story
what's your current favorite song let me
got my beats I use beats music it's an
app and I just download all my songs in
one little playlist so I like the gdfr
right now and the reason I like that
song from Flo Rida usually he's like not
my favorite but I really like this song
because me and Tiffany if you guys know
Tiffany is she's um my husband's
brother's girlfriend she's into dancing
I used to be a dancer so we decided to
look up a youtube video and there's this
like professional dancer and he teaches
in Hollywood but he also does like
YouTube videos and he'll tell you step
by step and we chose to dance to the
song one night and learn it and now I
just love it the trap Queen Fetty whap
right now and that I'm gonna blame on
Laura gorilla or Laura T 1 for 3 on
Instagram where are you now from
skrillex and diplo featuring Justin
Bieber and oh my god I have so many you
know you like it bye DJ snake and
alunageorge talking body by tuflow is
one of my fave i'm next question what's
your workout routine oh my god my
workout routine is um I basically just
don't work out I I want to work out
sometimes they do Zumba I fell off of
that for about 2 weeks already so I
really just don't work out I should that
sounds terrible I don't work out at all
I'm not on a diet of any kind right now
so yeah
I plan to be from Shandy Marty on
YouTube can you do a husband tag you
know how long you know how long I've
been wanting to do a husband tag so long
it's just so hard to get my husband to
get in a video he's super camera shy
he's very supportive he so if I wanted
to be a hand model he'd support me he's
like super supportive in whatever I do
though he's not ready to be in front of
the camera as much as I'd love for him
to be in my videos and do a husband tag
or a Q&amp;amp;A with him he's just shy so I'm
still working on it you guys helped me
out to tell him he needs to get in my
video
like yesterday um it says do you feel
comfortable in confident meeting people
in public without makeup in hairstyle
done um no one yes there's times when
I'm just like having no makeup on and if
I meet someone or you know or one of you
guys well if I make one of you guys I
wish I would have had makeup on so I can
look my best in front of you but meeting
random people are going about my day
without makeup or my hair done I'm
totally fine with it but yes if it was
one of you guys because I want to look
my best for you but any random person I
don't really don't care so I'm totally
confident and not wearing makeup where
do you live what's your work so I now
live in California I moved here last
year in January so I'm living here I'm
in full-time beauty and fashion vlogger
and that's my job that's my full-time
job where do you find your inspiration
to stay as positive as you do I would
definitely say that I was the most
negative I'm now a lot more positive
I think it's living in the present
moment instead of getting caught up with
negative thoughts and kind of like just
analyzing them that was me all the time
all the time and now I'm just learned to
live in the present moment and enjoy
life I wouldn't ask you if you could do
a DIY tour of your beauty room I'm dying
for that Chanel vase did you buy the
bigger perfume or just use it up or did
you make it so I think you're talking
about with this this guy right here this
is actually a regular base and I saw
something on Pinterest that had like the
Chanel sign on it so we just basically
made this sign out of paper glued it on
this vase so this is not a huge Chanel
perfume I wish it was probably be like
million dollars but yeah so that I
definitely DIY we definitely made that
and a tour of my Beauty room this is
actually a little piece of it see
studios and I film in this little
section here I kind of put together to
film sometimes I'll film here or I'll
film outside or in my room very seldom
do I feel my true
but I love filming here because I have
this cute set so this is the end of the
video I had so much fun answering your
questions let's do it again sometime if
you want other Q&amp;amp;A videos then just
comment or tweet me and I'll do that for
you and that's it I love you guys so
much and I'll see you in the next video
