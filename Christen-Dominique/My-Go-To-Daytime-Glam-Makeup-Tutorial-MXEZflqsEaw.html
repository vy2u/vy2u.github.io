working hey guys welcome back to my
channel so today I'm going to be doing
this look right here for you guys and I
think it's a really pretty look for this
entire season it's just really pretty
orange e red tones terracotta lip and
for some reason it matches my background
is so unintentional but I kind of like
it don't forget just subscribe to my
channel right there and hit that
notification bell so you can be part of
the quad family so if you want to learn
how to get this look then keep watching
we are gonna start off with the morphe
prep and set because this stuff is
absolutely amazing I love this stuff so
much it's a fine mist that just goes
over your skin it feels so refreshing
next thing we're going to get into is
foundation I'm going to be using the
Tarte Amazonian clay full coverage
foundation I'm going to take it back for
a minute because I haven't used this in
a long time
I just forgot how good it is so I'm
going to take that on with a Beauty
Blender and this is probably definitely
not that this is definitely not my shade
anymore it's a little better I was
actually blending in with the background
at one point that was kind of scary by
the way you guys I'm doing this video in
partnership with itse so there we go
this little sample size and all these
other little sample sizes that you'll
see are from the Ipsy glam bag and can I
just mention that the glam bag this
month is so so cute are those
dreamsicles I love Dreamsicle so this is
from City color cosmetics it's the bold
brow eyebrow powder in medium it has a
light shade in a dark shade so you can
mix it together and get your perfect Wow
match so I'm going to do this today I'm
not going to do like pomade or anything
I'm just going to go in with some brow
powder
I'm using the Turk shape tape what a
surprise I'm actually mixing light sand
together ooh that is bright mixing
medium because I don't have the light
medium right now since we're here what
the heck
might as well go down the nose little
ball line just going to go ahead and
bounce that sometimes I notice when I
bounce really hard on my scanner it kind
of separates or it doesn't like me the
coverage that I want I have to use a
very light gentle hand after a my myself
be gentle so that it blends into the
skin nice and it gives more coverage I'm
going to go ahead and use this lemonade
from benefit this is a color correcting
eyelid primer
I love yellows to call it correct or to
hide like under-eye circles or anything
like that because I just feel like oh
but no baby no no no no no boba see hi
boba ji she wants to eat the paper oh
you need to cut your nails yeah I'm
gonna go in with this ji way essential
matter shimmer palette right here for
the crease I'm going to take this shade
right in the middle this is a matte
taupe shade it's called desert so I'm
gonna take that pop it on to the crease
for some dimension and work it straight
through the crease my eyelid is very
bright and there is no dimension so kind
of excited to put this on my eye right
now bring my eye back to life I'm just
going right around the lid kind of
outlining where the lid is and then
blending this little bag if you sure
there's no harsh line very nice now I'm
going to go in with this red shade it's
called sepia the reddish orange and work
it on the outer part of the crease so
I'm just kind of like marking it out and
I I want to create like a outer V so
like that that'll be my little reference
when we start there and just start to
blend it out little circular motions
you're using a soft touch and you're
doing quick little short circles to
blend the
arounds make it really soft I'm gonna go
ahead and work on this inner part of my
lid for that I'm going to use the
Pacifica island life I shadow palette
and have these really pretty shimmery
shades in it okay so this one is called
skinny dip it's like the shimmery pink
one I'm also going to use coral sand
it's like an orange e pink and then
golden which is the golden shade first
I'm going to take this gold shade right
here and I'm going to work it right on
the lid I think it goes really pretty
with that orange e rustic shade on the
crease then I take this other brush from
Smith it's the Smith 247 and just going
between these two guys so they can blend
together the eye shadow has like a
creamy finish I like it a lot and it's
really pigmented and then I'm going to
go in with that this shimmery orange
pink shade and I'm going to take the
other side of the brush and work that
super close to the inner corners a
little bit closer down I want it to fade
and from the orange e to the golden and
that light pink shimmer in the inner
corners and then I'm going to go in with
the shimmering pink shade and pick that
up for the lower lash line I'm gonna go
in with this deep brown this matte deep
brown shade this is dark chocolate whoo
I like the Navy and I'm going to work
that right on the outer part of the lid
I mean lower lashline and then for the
inner part of the lower lash line I'm
going to take the orange shade but I'm
gonna go right on the bottom right there
that actually I'm going to take the gold
no on the outer part of the the crease
I'm going to take dark chocolate so I'm
going to take this makeup shaft ii8
brush and I'm going to go in there like
it needs a little bit more definition
I'm layering Sapir right over dark
chocolate and it's giving me a really
nice dimension I like the color it's
giving me so I'm just gonna keep doing
that I'm also going to take some of that
reddish shade I'm just going to pinch
this brush right here it kind of has
them on it I'm going to go right
underneath the dark chocolate shade I
just feel like it'll tie everything
together a little bit better now I'm
going to go in with a winged liner I'm
going to be using this la girl line art
matte eyeliner right here okay this
eyeliner actually dries to like a grey I
don't know why but I'm going over it
with the pixi by petra endless silky eye
pin
in the shade black noir and gosh it's
just going on like butter on my skin and
it's so nice it's so black and it's
fixing all little mistakes I never
thought I'd do an eyeliner a wing liner
with an eye pencil but is turning out
pretty good that is the longest wing
I've had in a really long time we're
moving on now I'm actually going to add
this other pixi by petra pencil it's in
the shade opal overcoat and I'm going to
put it right on the waterline I'm gonna
take the Kim Thai lashes from cake face
Beauty and such a cute box looks like a
little present and these are the lashes
they're very long and glam so I think
they will fit perfectly with this look
I'm just going to grab them cut the
edges pop them on and I will be right
back okay so now I'm going to move on to
the rest of my face I'm going to go in
with the urban decay and naked skin
shapeshifter and I'm going to take these
creams on this side first makes this
contour shade right here and I'm going
to chisel out my cheeks and use this
Sigma angled cream contour brush right
here grab that contour color and just
start to work that on my cheeks I'm just
going to cut them
then I'm just going to blend it out with
my little beauty blender I almost feel
like this contour color is a little too
ashy I mean I like a shadow effect but
this one is almost a little muddy I'm
gonna grab my Tarte clay stick and deep
honey it's gonna give me more of like a
bronzy look which I'm fine with and
contour at the same time so now we're
all contour I'm going to put some blush
on just cream blush right here from geek
Beauty it is called metalli matte
naturally quick drying blush and a boo
and it's like a peachy pink shade and
it's a smooth matte cream with like a
metallic sheen on it I'm gonna put that
on my cheeks I like that it has like a
matte finish to it and it dries like a
powder so you can actually use this as a
shadow too I'm going to set my under
eyes menus this Kat Von D translucent
powder and and then we're just gonna let
it sit there for a little bit I'm gonna
let that sit and bake and I'm actually
gonna do my lips while I do that
speaking of baking I'm going to use this
caked makeup lip fondant in the shade
low key and it has a heart as the oh I
thought that was really cute it's just
the small details in life this is like a
dusty muted terracotta color this is
also a vegan and cruelty free product
which is cool okay so now that I'm done
with my lips I'm just gonna dust off the
powder ooh this is a soft brush this is
from royal in lag and langnickel this is
a precision angled brush and it's very
soft the first thing that caught my eye
it will definitely be good as like a
little highlight on the nose so I'm
going to use this highlight from Dixie
glam bag it's for the urban decay
afterglow 8 hour powder highlighter so
this is in the shade sin I'm going to
take this so use that to highlight my
nose I like that it goes on sheer and
it's pretty blendable so this is kind of
good that it's this size not too small
it's not too big so it just fits perfect
