natural way but your makeup tells you
otherwise hey guys welcome back to my
channel so today I'm gonna be using all
of my go-to drugstore favorites to
create this makeup look right here I was
actually looking for I was wanting to do
something with a brown lip because I
found this really pretty lip from
Maybelline and I once I was like looking
up inspo and then I saw this picture of
Kylie and she had her lip was way darker
than mine
but I was inspired by Kylie's look she
had like a gold lid very simple and I
thought it was really pretty so if I was
going to the drugstore these are all of
my go-to products that I would use so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video it's
nothing of the drugstore brows concealer
foundation everything except for the
lashes so if you want to see how I got
this look right here don't forget to
subscribe to my channel and hit that
notification bell so you can be a part
of the quad family and without further
ado let's get on with the video starting
off with my brows I'm gonna be using the
Loreal brow stylist definer in the shade
dark brunette very thin pencil I'm gonna
go in and do my brows first before I put
on any foundation because it's gonna
stick to my skin a little bit easier so
I'm really just gonna go with the
natural shape for my brow I have pretty
thin brows so I'm just gonna leave it
like that and move on to the rest of my
face I'm gonna be using the new
maybelline superstay full coverage
foundation and this is in the shade warm
nude I actually used this in a video
coming up really soon and I'm in that
video I'm using it for the first time
but in this video I've already used it
but you're gonna see this video first so
if that confuses you my bad this is a
very matte foundation work it into my
skin whoa
now one thing about this foundation is
that it is a very matte foundation it
doesn't make it feel like a dried-up
raisin but it does give you that powdery
matte finish so for me I would go over
this after I'm done with my foundation
then I'll go over with in spritz and fix
plus or some type of hydrating mist this
foundation is
for oily skin you don't need very much
of this foundation because it is
extremely full coverage it will cover
everything now I'm just gonna use some
concealer so you can prime the eyes and
cover these under-eye circles in
darkness around my face so I'm gonna
take the l'oreal which I'm literally
just opening up right now the L'Oreal
total cover I'm gonna go ahead and use
my finger in them lightest to shade for
my under eyes and right just around the
entire eye I'm actually going to any bet
right now so I figured why not film a
video on the makeup that I'm gonna do
it's clean up the brows I'm gonna use a
brush so I'm gonna take that color in
with this makeup Shakti 58 brush okay
I'm gonna grab this Tarte blush but I'm
just using the mirror I'm not using the
blush so I'm just gonna go in and clean
it up this is a thicker kind of
concealer perfect for cleaning up the
brows making sharp defined lines on the
face I normally set my eyes with powder
but especially with this cream you
definitely need to set your eyes I'm
gonna take this Gigi Hadid eye contour
palette right here it's so cute it's all
mattes inside looks like that I'm gonna
take this shade right here it's kind of
like a nudie beige I'm gonna take that
all over the lid so I'm gonna take a
flat brush just gonna load up my brush
in that little section and I'm gonna pop
it all over the lid so we have a nice
base this is actually a lot darker than
what I thought it was gonna be softening
out the edges this is actually a really
nice color it's a little darker than
what I was expecting but that's okay I'm
gonna go into the crease with this guy
and this one just gonna mix them
together
take both of those colors right on the
lower lash line and now I'm just picking
up that Brown and working that into the
outer part of the eye like the outer V
area and then I'm going to take this
beautiful deep warm gold right here
looks like this it's really really
pretty
and these shadows I'm telling you are
like butter yeah if you took your finger
and swiped it across the butter and
that's what these shadows feel like that
for sure the best feeling shadows in the
drugstore right now for the inner
corners I'm going to take this lighter
shade of gold it's more of a pale
champagne and I'm gonna pop got into the
inner corners this is just gonna bring
light to this area and make our eyes
look more wide awake bright now I'm
gonna do a wing for the wing I'm gonna
be using the l'oreal voluminous it's
very sharp that's why I like it I like
it a lot and I'm going to start my wing
off right out here I'm gonna give my
eyes more of the lifted look so I'm
gonna angle it upwards and bring it down
I like going this way cuz it glides
against the skin a little bit easier
for the lashes I want them to look very
curled and spaced out but full so I'm
gonna go with these guys right here from
violet boss these are the wispy myname
eyelashes and I'm just gonna pop this on
really quick I just find it a little bit
easier sometimes to put the lashes on
first and then mush them together with
mascara sometimes you may think you're
going for a natural way but your makeup
tells you otherwise I'm just gonna add a
little pop of gold on the lower lash
line so I'm going to take this
Maybelline a lasting drama light liner
in the shade star light gold I'm gonna
add a little bit more concealer I'm
using the Loreal infallible glow
this concealer is actually a nice pair
with this foundation because it adds a
little bit of luminosity and moisture
back into the face so now I'm gonna set
my under eye gonna be using the
Maybelline fit me fair lights setting
powder with my damp at Beauty Blender
I'm gonna go into the powder and go
right underneath the eyes right into
here
well that's baking I'm gonna go ahead
and contour my face with this Maybelline
and master bronze bronze in highlight
kit I'm gonna use that shade to contour
my cheekbones I'm gonna go right
underneath the hollow just having that
loose powder sitting there kind of helps
everything move very smoothly over the
skin so if you're doing your blush or
you're doing your contour it's just
gonna help the other powders glide into
the skin a lot easier and just make it
look a lot more natural
and I'm gonna just kick off the powder
really quick and really focus on
bronzing up the face to bronze my face
I'm gonna use this middle shade right
here and I'm gonna do bronzer instead of
blush today's keep it pretty simple and
just warm up the face and then for the
highlight I'm gonna use the new master
chrome metallic highlighter from
Maybelline in the shade molten rose gold
I know it looks really pink here but
it's actually a beautiful rose gold it
doesn't just look pink okay for the lip
I'm really excited about it I'm gonna be
using this shade right here it's called
Amazonian very cool it goes on like a
gloss but then it dries matte so it's
nice good - okay there's another one
that looks just like it it's in this
tube it's called fighter and it's dark
it's a darker shade but the tube looks
lighter take fighter right on top that
was the wrong color it's just a tad bit
darker
thank you guys for watching I hope you
