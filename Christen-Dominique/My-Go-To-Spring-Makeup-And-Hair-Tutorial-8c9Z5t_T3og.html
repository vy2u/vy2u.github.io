today I am very excited literally I have
like goosebumps the excitement is
probably going to overflow into your
screen right now because I haven't done
a makeup tutorial in a really long time
it's been forever Springs here and I
figured it would be perfect time to do a
peachy spring look can we just talk
about this palette this is a new palette
from Too Faced and it smells like
peaches damn to face back at it again I
honestly wanted to lick it to see if it
tastes like a peach it tastes like a
peach I don't recommend you actually eat
this I'm just weird
so that anyways I'm really excited so
I'm just going to get right into the
tutorial it's a beautiful spring peach
look and I hope you guys enjoy it if you
want to learn how to get this look then
keep watching so my skin has been extra
dry for some reason so I'm gonna go in a
step extra today and apply this
treatment oil it's supposed to deeply
nourish your skin and hydrate it this is
from a nude skin care it's their pro
genius Omega treatment oil and I just
feel like my skin needs that extra step
I'm going for a hydrating primer today
to to hopefully help my skin get out of
this whatever it's in this one's for
makeup forever it's their step one skin
equalizer hydrating primer and it's
lightweight its creamy makes your makeup
last for hours before I start my
foundation I wanted to call it correct I
got some requests to do a tutorial with
this palette from Tarte and it's a color
correcting palette which is amazing I've
been using it a lot lately as you guys
can see it's kind of messy the one that
I really like is this one right here
Soren G reddish one I like to use this
underneath my eyes so this orange one is
really good for people with darker skin
tones or who have extremely dark
under-eye circles I feel like I am in
that category of extremely dark
under-eye circles so I use the orange
one but if you're a lighter skin tone
you want to use the yellow in the
palette and then I take the green one
for the redness around my nose in other
parts of my face and those are just
areas I used the color correcting
palette with so this is just my quick go
to color correct I'm actually going to
use a little bit around my mouth it gets
dark in this area and then for
foundation I have been using the ex1
invisi where I have always wanted to try
this and I finally got it in it's
amazing I honestly I was like thinking
that it wasn't going to work
as well as it works I'm it's full
coverage and it feels really good on
your face right now I am in the shade F
300 but I'm sure once my hand wears off
this is loving tan by the way I'm going
to be F 100 so I have this shade right
here I'm just going to take a little bit
of this guy with my Beauty Blender I'm
gonna get a new one obviously so I'm
going to fill in my brows with the color
pop bankin brunette brow color and I'm
going to use this brush right here from
Boger XI and just so that I can get
really precise line
as a base I'm going to use soft ochre so
that everything is one shade I'm going
to start off with summer YUM this
reddish brown shade and I'm gonna work
it into the crease and the lower part of
the eyes the lower lash lines the lower
part of the eyes I decided to go back in
with the same shade on the crease I
wanted to pump up the intensity but if
you don't like it too pumped up or if
you want even more don't worry about it
it doesn't have to be the same as mine
you do you boo boo for outer corners I'm
going to use handied peach it's such a
beautiful color I love how it's an
orange matte but then it has these loose
purple letters in it it's really really
pretty color and so I'm going to use
some of that on the outer part of my
eyelids
we're going to leave the center open so
we can place another color in there
honestly I was so excited to get this
palette and it just makes me think of
what are they gonna do next like what
other is there gonna be a banana palette
it's gonna smell like bananas
blueberries you can do so it's like
endless
I love Too Faced they're so cute they're
packaging everything I like it I like it
a lot so for the center color I'm going
to use and take a flat shader brush this
is from mrs. zoeva there 234 and I'm
going to use nectar which is this
beautiful shade right here and pop it on
to the center of the lids it's going to
make our eyes look amazing it's just
going to make your eyes pop
yes imagine if I just stopped here and I
didn't blend it out so these shadows are
super pigmented I don't really need a
pack on much of this shade so I'm going
to go ahead and work on that marrying
the colors together where they need to
be married because I'm going to take
this brush here on the clean side and
just go back and forth in these small
little emotions now I'm going to go back
into candied peach and I'm going to drag
it across the lower lash line for the
brow bone I'm going to use peaches and
cream assistance soft nude pinkish shade
and for the inner corner highlight I'm
going to pop on this pink toned shimmer
shadow I'm going to go ahead and apply
some eyeliner this one is from
Illamasqua
it's the precision ink liner in abyss
I'm just gonna line the top lashline
it's like a little baby wing yeah I
wouldn't even call it away what I am
doing is making it to where it's tapered
so it's going to be thinner on the inner
corners and then get thicker as we go
out and then for my waterline I'm going
to use this nude shade it's from Tarte
this is the inner rim liner and it's
just nude I'm gonna go ahead and apply
some mascara you kind of know how that
goes and this is my favorite one by the
way and then imma come back and when do
the lashes I'm going to be using the
Lily lashes and these are in Mykonos
they are very fluffy I probably should
have went a little bit softer on the
lashes but that's okay they still look
good for the concealer I'm going to use
the Mac Pro Longwear concealer in NC 25
a little bit underneath my eyes I'm
going to take it over to the side of my
nose too and then bring it up
and this is the time where I go in and
highlight the parts of my face that I
want to highlight and that's usually the
center of my brows the bridge of my nose
and the sides of my mouth just because
it gets really dark in that area and
then I'm just going to contour my nose a
little bit with a cream contour and this
is the JD wavy nose contour brush it is
amazing you guys if you haven't tried it
you definitely have to go try it I'll
link it below after all my creams are
blended I'm going to go ahead and set
all the creaminess in place with a
powder and that's just going to help it
last longer and stay where it's at and
to highlight my under eyes I have been
using this for so long already it's the
manic Adar powder in c3 I just go over
the dark areas of my face and then I go
back over with a yellow highlighting
powder from the Tarte contour powdered
palate so I'm gonna go ahead and you
know just take my face just doing the
huge and then I'm just gonna add a
little warmth to my face just by putting
some bronzer around the temples and the
cheekbones and just for a nice flush of
color I'm gonna pop on this peach blush
and I like to keep it behind my
cheekbones just because I think it looks
a little more natural that way and now
I'm gonna go in with a highlight this is
color pops highlight and wisp and this
is going to give you a pearlized glowy
finish which I love on my cheekbones my
nose and my Cupid's bow and then for the
lips I'm just going to use a neutral
soft shade to balance out the eye shadow
and now I'm just showing you how dry my
skin has been again I'm honestly happy
that I got all this hydrating stuff in
the apt glam bag so now I'm just gonna
do a quick little hairstyle that you can
do for spring it's really easy I'm just
adding is some volumizing spray to my
hair first so I'm just amping that up
just a little bit and then I'm just
taking the sides of my hair rolling it
back and then pinning it so just rolling
a chunk of the hair and then pinning it
back it sounds crazy easy and it's
because it is but it
looks really cute and it's great for the
spring I hope you guys enjoyed this
