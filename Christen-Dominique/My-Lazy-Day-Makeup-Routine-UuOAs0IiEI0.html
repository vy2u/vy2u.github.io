get those vibes hey guys welcome back to
my channel so today I am doing a lazy
super lazy makeup routine this is when
you don't feel like doing anything like
you literally just want to lay on the
couch all day maybe go to lunch possibly
you don't want to look like how you woke
up basically that's me when I'm not
filming so many tips for you guys on
this look because I think it's so
important to still look like you tried
but I mean you don't have to use a ton
of makeup you don't have to go through
these crazy amounts of steps you don't
have to bake you don't have to
foundation it powder it prime it you
don't have to do all those things if
you're if you're feeling lazy really
important to multi-purpose whatever you
have bronzers and highlights you can
multi-purpose all day all night you
don't need a ton of products you really
really don't this is literally a
two-minute I can honestly do this makeup
in two minutes
but because I'm talking through it it's
a little bit longer so if I wasn't
talking through and explaining why I use
this and how to use it and giving you
tips and tricks this video would
literally be honestly maybe even one
minute I could do this look in one
minute I have confidence woo that's a
good challenge it makes you look fresh
like you tried you just look put
together and you didn't even really do
much or put much on this is something
that I do every time I don't feel like
waking up but I have to wake up I have
to do things I have to take Jayden to
school I have to go to the grocery store
I have to see people and I want people
to see me like crazy if you want to
learn some tips and tricks on how to do
your makeup on a very lazy very I'm not
trying to have anything to do with my
life today kind of day but still look
put together then keep watching and
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
and hit got notification bells they give
you part of the quad family come on
let's say it together quad family and
without further ado let's get on with
this lazy tutorial on a lazy day I'm not
gonna grab pomade or powder or anything
like that I'm gonna grab a brow pencil
so I have the Anastasia brow Wiz in soft
brown I'm going to fill in my brows and
then
groom them up and I'll be done I sketch
my brows back and forth like this and I
try to focus on the areas where it's
really sparse so I'm recreating hmmm and
I'll just go back and forth these quick
little motions bring it all the way to
the front now if you use a light hand
and you're just sketching their brows
really quick the frame your brow won't
get as harsh and then I'll just clean it
up with a spoolie try to ignore this
huge set going on right on my brow bone
it's so annoying it won't go away and
it's huge so we're just gonna try to
ignore it even though I just said it for
the rest of the face I would skip on
foundation completely skip on doing all
the extra stuff of foundation concealer
primer contour setting it I wouldn't do
any of that all I would do is put on
something that's going to protect your
skin even it out do all of those things
basically on one the glam routine for my
face is in this bottle right here it's
the CC cream from our boria it'll also
cover imperfections like breakouts
blemishes and it evens out your skin
texture so it makes your skin look
flawless and it's not even a foundation
it's a CC cream it comes out white so if
you put it on your hand it kind of looks
like with that supposed to adapt to your
skin tone so it comes out white at first
like this and then I'm just gonna dot it
around where I want to put it basically
all over my face so I'm gonna work that
in with my finger you can use a Beauty
Blender for this that I like to use my
finger because I just like the way it
feels
it even helps with my under-eye circles
around the mouth honestly this is the
best BB CC cream I have ever tried in my
entire life I don't even like BB or CC
creams to be honest because I feel like
they do nothing for my face and you know
I have to have my coverage at some some
kind of coverage if I'm not using a
foundation and then I'm just gonna use a
concealer but then I found this and I
gave it a chance and I'm like I love it
I'm a believer I can actually add some
concealer so I'm going to add a little
bit of tart medium concealer just a
little bit in the
corners just blend it in with a little
beauty blender and I'm actually gonna
cover this little guy up too because he
is really really red I was using
light/medium under my eyes but lately
I've been liking the more toned down
under-eye brightening technique because
I just feel like it looks a little more
natural and I like the way it just
blends into the rest of my skin more
seamless than as a lighter under-eye so
that is it for the face and now I'm
gonna move on I'm gonna let that dry
because I'm not gonna set this I know
that sounds really weird it works trust
me the only thing I'll do is spritz a
little bit of tachi dewy skin mist
throughout the day and it'll keep it
fresh and dewy looking and trust me your
coverage will stay there for the eyes
it's so freakin simple it's not even
funny you can use any bronzer that you
want any favorite bronzer that you have
I'm using balm each from the balm and
it's called warm it up I'm gonna take
this on my cheeks on my eyes and this is
basically going to define to give us a
soft contour add some warmth to our face
and it's gonna do so many things for our
eyes this is a definite multi-purpose
staple for a lazy day for a girl on the
go it does everything I'm gonna grab an
eyeshadow brush if you're feeling super
extra lazy you can use your finger and
just dab it on your eyelid but I'm gonna
use a brush since they're right here
I literally all I have to do is stretch
my arm out and grab so it's okay I'm
gonna put it all over my lid and I
actually didn't put any concealer on my
natural lid because I already have like
a little bit of hyperpigmentation that I
don't mind it kind of works for me it
gives me some type of dimension so I
naturally have that work it all the way
into the crease fluffier brush to blend
out the edges that's basically it for
the eyes I'm literally not going to
touch anything else on my eyelids except
for the mascara which is the most
important part to make your eyes look
awake you need a good mascara my
favorite mascara to use my go-to is the
Maybelline colossal Big Shot makeup
Shayla color this is baddest black and
it is so dark I like the original
formula but I like this particular black
one from Shayla because a little bit
drier of a formula at least the tube
that I have is a little bit more dry
holds the curl it doesn't weigh your
lashes down
have a really wet formula it's gonna
make your lashes like fall pack on a ton
of mascara
try not to clump it up and that's all
we're gonna do and that's gonna be it
see when I put it on it's not super
shiny it literally just grabs each lash
pulls it out curls it up but you gotta
wiggle right in between and I like to
brush my lashes in the wrong direction
so it picks up more volume right and
then left and I wiggle up and it really
stretches and pulls your lashes out you
see that and because it's a dry formula
it's gonna stay and that's all I'm gonna
do to my eyes I'm actually gonna curl my
lashes but I'm gonna have them dry so
while they dry up I'm going to do the
rest of my face which is gonna be super
simple I feel like this is gonna go by
so quick that I can't believe this is
even a tutorial bronzers your best
friend because it is dual purpose so
what I'm gonna do right now is add some
definition to my cheeks my nose my
forehead it's basically like contour
blush bronze all in one so I'm gonna
take this morphe angled brush right here
and I'm going to work that on my cheeks
because I'm not putting powder all over
the face it gives your skin a fresh look
I like it can be lazy and still look
good you don't have to have that many
stocks I promise and then if you want to
blend out the shadow if you want to you
can go go ahead and hit it right on the
lid nose under the chin so now that our
face is bronze we have some color on our
face we look like we tried I'm gonna go
ahead and put on a highlight that's
gonna really make it look like we tried
the highlight I just got this new
highlight in from Oprah this is one of
the Nicki collab highlights I'm very
excited to use it i swatched it it is
literally just like the name says
Global's this is the Global's
highlighter it is beautiful first of all
second of all right I feel like I'm the
worst watcher but literally look how
beautiful that is this on my cheeks I'm
so excited so with this I'm just going
to
what though so bright it is so blinding
I'm gonna take it right above my brows
the nose its boat okay I think I went a
little too far with the nose calm it
down a little bit around there and that
actually want to put it in my inner
corners too when you get makeup that
just makes you want to do your makeup
this glow Nikki know you can literally
blind somebody with this highlight you
got to be careful I'll be very careful
now for the lips I want something that
is going to hydrate give me a little bit
of color and make sure that my lips
don't look crusty you know just know
crustiness so I'm gonna take this h2o
beauty Oh wases l-bomb and this is in
the shade rose petal so it has a little
bit of color I'm gonna put some on the
back of my hand it looks like so and I'm
just gonna take that right on my lips
this gives your lips a little bit of a
pink tint it moisturizes them and that's
all you need honestly something that
does two things in one
like I don't want a matte lip I don't
want a gloss I just want something
that's gonna hydrate my lips and have a
little bit of a color to them now that
my eyelashes are dry I'm gonna go in and
curl them and I'll be done another tip
is if you're feeling lazy the easiest
way to look put together is
straightening your hair it's so easy you
don't have to try he literally just
straighten it that's all I did for this
video
