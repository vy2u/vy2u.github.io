what my lazy day routine looks like and
that includes hair makeup skincare
outfit and my breakfast so let's get
started so after I peel myself out of
bed and straight to the kitchen of your
breakfast and my lazy breakfast is
cereal and if you don't already know I
kind of have a really big sweet tooth so
today I'm going to have fruity pebbles
you know the usual grownups and this is
when I go on Twitter and Instagram or I
read in hi to your comments see what's
up into everyone's life favorite your
tweets in all that stuff so quickly
freshen up my face I'm just taking my
Paula's Choice cleanser to remove any
dirt or oils that can give me any bigger
acne problems so I'm just gonna use my
cleanser everything else in my skincare
routine is pretty much skipped at this
point except for my Cetaphil
moisturizing i am using my seat of the
lotion to hydrate my skin before I start
my makeup and when I'm feeling lazy I
don't want to use heavy makeup on myself
so I use a BB cream slash primer from
bare minerals and yep it's my Holy Grail
I can't express it to you guys enough
how much I love this little guy to the
point that I have to go and buy a
full-size at some point in my life very
soon in the coverage and lightweight
feel is amazing nothing can beat it as
of right now so I need a little extra
coverage under my eyes so I'm going to
take my honest Ozzie concealer and just
cover up those under-eye circles that I
naturally have and can't get rid of any
other way because sleeping doesn't work
and I don't know why I sounded like that
right now any other
okay so I said I wasn't gonna put on too
much makeup but I have this really bad
blemish on my face and it's pretty
distracting so I'm gonna do everyone a
favor and cover it up using a darker
concealer to hide this blemish and then
what the heck it's on my cheek so let's
just use it as a contour since the color
is a little bit darker than my natural
skin tone now I'm taking this super
adorable hydrating yummy chapstick I got
from my friend KL who lives in Hong Kong
I love it so much Thank You KL to lock
in my face makeup I'm dusting on the
mineral veil from bare minerals it's a
translucent powder that leaves your skin
feeling super soft to quickly fill in my
brows and using the M by Michelle Phan
long-wear brow liner in the color black
but trust me it's not black it's really
like a dark brown and going to fill in
and comb through my brows so they look a
little bit more groomed and this is
quick and easy so I'm just using a
pencil
to make sure my brows keep their shape
all day I'm using my honest Asya clear
brow gel next I'm taking my Kat Von D
tattoo liner because no matter if I'm
feeling lazy a wing will be on my eye of
some sort and it's usually this tiny
baby wing if I'm feeling lazy or Cache
that day so the bigger and sharper the
wing gets it means I felt like dressing
up that day so you can always tell when
I'm in depending on my way
moving on to the lashes I'm using my
all-time favorite Vincent Longo mascara
this is the volume plus free mascara and
this is going to open my eyes add volume
and keep them nice and curled all day I
promise this is the bomb you have to buy
it to add a warm blow I'm using the
lorac tantalizer matte bronzer on the
outer edges of my face and blending that
down to my neck using the Mac 180 brush
or blush I'm using the forever 21 blush
in rose petal to the apples of my cheeks
focusing more behind the apples of my
cheeks for any natural look and this is
going to hopefully brighten my look up
and help me not look oh not so lazy
we're a light girly touch of pink I'm
taking the prettiest pink gloss ever
from NYX butter gloss and Eclair and
yeah it's another all-time favorite now
I'm going to add a little bit of shimmer
to my lips and I'm using the lip gloss
from forever 21 and I don't know the
name but it will be in the description
here is the final look and now it's time
for my lazy hair and I usually don't
know what to do with it so I just put it
in a bun and I'm just putting it in a
high ponytail and then after I have my
ponytail secured wrapping it around my
head like so and I'm just going to put
another hair band over it to secure it
in place and yeah it looks kind of crazy
and messy but it is a lazy hair look so
and then I'm taking two little strings
out of my side I'm kind of messing it up
and fluffing out out more taking some
bobby pins and pinning it in place and
there we go we have our lazy day hair
moving on to the outfit I am wearing
these forever 21 rolls gold studs
wearing this crossbow
shirt it's super relaxed from Ross and I
have these blue jean shorts from H&amp;amp;M and
my Michael Kors watch and then my
handy-dandy trusty sandals from forever
21 and that is my completed look thank

comments what your lazy day breakfast is
