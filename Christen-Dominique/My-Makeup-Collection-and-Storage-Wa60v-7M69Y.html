today I'm gonna be showing you my
long-awaited highly requested makeup
collection I finally organized my makeup
it's been very disastrous for a very
long time I finally had my cousin over
she's great at organizing and I suck at
organizing so I needed that push to get
my makeup where it is right now and it
is finally there it's not all the way
there I feel like but I feel like no
matter how long I work on it I'll always
want to keep working on it so I think
that's just a personal thing but I have
everything organized I can finally show
you guys my makeup collection I'm super
excited by the way you guys I have a ton
of makeup I have like a crazy amount of
makeup that I wouldn't normally have if
I wasn't a beauty blogger so companies
send me tons of makeup all the time to
reveal on my channel or you that's why I
have a lot of makeup just in case you're
wondering like how was she getting all
this makeup that is why that is how this
is my makeup collection / organization
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
to keep updated with my videos and hit
that notification bell right there so
you can be a part of the quad family
we're very strong this quad family of
art without further ado let's get on
with it this is the door to my Beauty /
filming room so you'll see some black
messy cords over there that's just where
I film but this is my makeup collection
right here and this is just an overview
of it right there just some Alex shores
and then these guys from The Container
Store which I got the idea from desi I
saw her snap and she had like a bunch of
them it was so gorgeous so I went to go
and get some in different sizes and I'm
just gonna start up here a lot of these
organizers are from impressions vanity
except for these guys from The Container
Store but like the lipstick holders and
these guys right here and the Beauty
Blender holder is from impressions
vanity and I guess I'll just start right
in this section so these are all my
Beauty blenders and then back here
have some from Pierce oh yes they just
put fingerprints all over it's all right
though guy saw it when it was clean so
go ahead and start with these drawers
right here what I've done so far is I
have all the new colour-pop lippie x'
right here let me just get in there oh
oh we have to stand up on this chair
this is real life right now you guys so
this was part of the peach collection
right here I try to keep the bottom of
the lippies and tubes kind of facing
outwards so I can see which color I'm
picking up and then right here in the
center we have the new allotted lippies
and these are the ultra blotted lips
right here and then in Monsieur I have
the Sigma loose shimmers all the newest
shades right here and then this right
here is from a violet boss is one of
their new glitters called Kiki so I have
that right here so I can try that and
then this is the BH Cosmetics Carli
bybel deluxe edition palette right here
and then in here these are not new Adam
in so many videos but I actually don't
have space for these in my concealer
drawer so I put them right over to the
side on here these over here are the new
Urban Decay eyeshadow primers have new
shades which i think is really cool this
is caffeine fix
freebase caffeine these are all the new
colors and then they're bringing sin
back so this is sin right here as a
primer and then back here I have the
Urban Decay Velvet Iser mixing medium I
haven't tried that yet I want to try it
out and then this came in this morning
from Oprah it's their new magnetic
palette this highlighter came with it
and then this drawer right here is just
the Urban Decay Naked palette like one
two three smoky electric palette you
guys remember when this came out such
fun colors then I have over here the
shade + light eye palette from um Kat
Von D here I have my liquid liners these
are the two faced with the liners the
packaging is so adorable on these and
then these are the Urban Decay
razorsharp liners and then over here I
have the Urban Decay liquid Munda
I shadow and they are mixed in with the
color tattoo of a Maybelline absolute
just came out with these pastel liquid
liners which I think are really pretty
so I want to try those guys out here I
have some more liquid liners these are
different brands I have L'Oreal blink
hourglass Tarte
these type liners are so so good they're
super black these are liners as well and
in the last drawer I have different
liners and here's still gotta figure out
what to put here and then down here I
have some Alex Shores and then I used to
store my makeup in here really sloppy
actually Pitt now that I have these
organizers it's just so much easier to
use those like everything that I get
from ELF I put in here and the rest of
these drawers are pretty empty go ahead
and move on to this guy right here this
is going to be I have one palette in
here actually I have three so this right
here is going to be four new palettes
that have came in that I want to try

and then the darker tone one back here
they just have powders right here you
can contour with highlight and then they
have creams on the other side right here

that just came in and they are so so
gorgeous so yeah that's one swatch on my
hand they are so bright beautiful I love
them so much they're definitely going to
give you that Instagram kind of
highlight and then back here I just have
some brushes in this cup that's those
mornings blow but actually mornings are
my favorite part of the day right down
here I have all my foundations the only
thing about these is that if you pull it
too forward it will all come out so be
careful with that if you decide to get
them actually I have my cousin help me
