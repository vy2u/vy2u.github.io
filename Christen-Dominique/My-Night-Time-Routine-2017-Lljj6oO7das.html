school today it good would you do you
work every day for this thing
Oh
my nighttime routine so Jaden's hair is
blue because today was crazy hair day at
school and he wanted to pick blue and
originally we wanted it spiked but we
ran out of time so we had to just spray
it and when we get home usually go our
separate ways
Cesar immediately picks up Bobo because
that is his daughter he is obsessed with
her loves her way more than me at least
that's what I think and then me and
Jaden go over homework and make sure he
got everything correct and then I'll go
ahead and make him a snack Jaden is
usually starving after school I don't
know why but every day it's like he's
never eaten in his life so I'll make him
a snack and his favorite snack is cheeto
puffs not the healthiest thing but I
will also include some kind of fruit in
there for him but I get where he gets it
from I love hot cheetos so I get it
while he's eating his snack
I usually tidy up the house and pick up
things that are lying in random places
pick up the boxes from PR packages sees
his new PlayStation is right there
there's just a bunch of boxes we got new
patio furniture so those huge boxes are
just ready to get thrown out but I do
that while he's eating after Jaden's
taken care of in the house is tidied I
can go and change into some comfortable
clothes so right now I'm just grabbing
some comfies and switching my shoes to
some really really comfortable slippers
these troll slippers are so cute not
only are they cute but they're super
comfortable literally feels like I'm
walking on air and then I'll just take
off my bracelets put my hair up and of
course I still haven't taken off my
necklace or my earrings so I don't know
why I didn't take them off but yeah I
just took off my bracelet my bracelets
the ones that make noise are usually the
most annoying ones to have on throughout
the day so I'll take those off first but
I always like to spend some time with my
little boba baby she's so so cute I
can't get over her like I live with her
I see her every day sleep with her every
night she's so cute it hurts just look
at her face look at the face it's so
cute
and after everybody's changed and
comfortable we usually have dinner and
then we go into the living room and
everybody kind of just gets together and
we'll either watch a movie I'll watch a
show or we'll just like play on our
phones and Jaden will play minecraft but
we'll be together in this living room
doing something so today we're reading a
book because Jaden just got this new
book and Cesar's playing is a new
playstation for VR actually I've been
playing it - I am addicted to resident
evil right now I know everybody's scared
of that game but I am not scared I think
it's super fun of course you don't play
that when Jaden's around usually
sleeping by that time but Jaden really
likes to play the racing games and so
he's playing the VR game tonight
around Jaden's bedtime he'll go and
brush his teeth and I actually go in
there with him to make sure that he
brushes them right because he does not
like to brush his teeth but honestly I
remember not liking to brush my teeth
either his making sure he brushes the
box cuz you know kids will forget that
and we have so many lights in our
restrooms I still haven't figured this
out but he he has to go through this
whole thing to turn off the light and
then he gets in bed and he's being so
extra right now because he is being
filmed he knows that
you
once Jayden is in bed I'll have some new
time and I'll take off my makeup just
take off the day and I got these really
cute name plates from Hart's wedding
they are so cute now they're my
decoration for my rest room
don't wear extensions everyday but when
I do and I just take them off and then I
peel off my eyelashes I swear to you it
is one of the best feelings in the world
oh so good I can just do whatever I want
I can rub my eyes if I want to I can put
my hands throughout my hair and if I
really like the lashes I'll put them in
here this is a like a lash holder I got
it from house of lashes so I'll just put
them in there and now I'll just take off
my makeup the first thing I do when I
take off my makeup is lips and eyes
especially if I'm wearing a bold lip so
I'll take some makeup remover and wash
my foundation off and then I'll actually
take my foundation off with a special
remover and then I'll go in with my
cleanser and I'll just wash my face
really good if you guys want it in death
detailed skincare routine let me know
and I can make that in a separate video
he's in the shot and I'm like Caesar
this is my nighttime routine hey he's
just like whatever
and ready for bed we'll go and we'll
watch either a movie or a show I finally
felt those earrings in my ear so I had
to take them out because I cannot stand
that poke whenever you're on your pillow
I can't do it so I took them off and
including my ring I completely forgot to
take that off too and I will just watch
a movie I am one of those animated movie
watchers I will gasp I will cry I mean
I'm all into it so Cesar usually has to
deal with that after that we just go to
sleep and then I ask him to turn off the
light even though it's right next to me
I still ask him I get really lazy
towards this time a night but that's
pretty much it I love you guys so much
thank you for watching my nighttime
routine and I'll see you in the next
video bye dollies
however my get ready with me these are
really you are being so extra take a
look at the camera I guess I'll turn off
the light</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
