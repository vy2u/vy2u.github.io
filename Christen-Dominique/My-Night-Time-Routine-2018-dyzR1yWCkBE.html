my nighttime routine come and follow
along with me as I go to sleep so once
I'm done filming a video I'll go ahead
and turn off these huge hot lights it is
a hotbox in there and then I'll go
straight to my room to get ready to
party because I am ready to show off
this makeup I'm just kidding I am a team
Netflix and chill all day every day what
really happens is I go to my restroom
and I take off my makeup especially it's
late at night during the week like this
I'll go ahead and use a makeup wipe to
remove all of my makeup and it's really
easy just to stop there and just go on
with your life but then I'd have to
crazy break out so then I take off these
lashes oh this is the best feeling ever
ripping your lashes off is up there with
like getting I don't know what is a good
feeling when getting your box ratchet or
something I don't know it feels really
really good and then I use a cleanser
just to wash my face so more recently I
have been using the Korres Wild Rose 15%
vitamin C spotless serum yeah that
sounds like a huge mouthful but it's
actually amazing so I feel like I have
to say every little thing that is in
here because this formula has helped so
much with my hyperpigmentation and my
dark spots it's cool because the top
half is wild rose oil with 15% vitamin C
and that's gonna help brighten and even
out your skin tone and then the bottom
half is a very powerful dark spot
removal and that targets spots and
hyperpigmentation if you mix it together
it turns pink which is super cute and
that's why it's like really fun to use
I've been using this for the past 14
days or so and my skin has definitely
brightened up is more even and there's
less discoloration which is amazing and
I cannot stop using this I definitely
use it every night and I want to give a
special thanks to Korres for partnering
up with me in this video so once I'm
done washing my face I'll go ahead and
change into some comfy clothes and then
I'll head over
to dinner with Jaden usually sees her
who'll be here to which Caesar is
actually here you just does not want to
be in the video so he is filming us but
we are eating dinner I'm just eating
some Chipotle keeping it pretty simple
tonight and then I'm taking Jade into
bed and saying goodnight usually pray I
read him a story so I just get some good
night and then I go and have some me
time and what I like to do before I go
to bed is drink some hot tea so my
favorite tea that I've been loving
recently is this bed tiny bliss
chamomile tea chamomile I can't even say
that chamomile tea it also has orange
peel and mint in it it's just super
relaxing I love having this before I go
to bed but definitely not before I watch
my show The Handmaid's Tale I'm also
looking for a new show to watch on
Netflix so it was any of you guys know
of any comment down below so I can check
it out because I definitely need some
new shows to watch I love to binge watch
and right now I have like nothing to
binge watch but I do watch this show
like religiously and Jersey Shore
I know it's ratchet but it's something
that I really enjoy if any of you guys
spot some street signs in my house
that's Jaden's artwork they just let him
be creative I think he's created his own
little town in our house but that's
pretty much it now I'm gonna head to bed
thank you guys for hanging out with me
tonight and until the next video good
night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
