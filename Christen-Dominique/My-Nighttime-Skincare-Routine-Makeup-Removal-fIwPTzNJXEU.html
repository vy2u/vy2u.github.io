putting my son to bed first so he always
has to have a glass of water before he
goes to bed it's just a habit he's
developed and here he is shuffling his
shoes off crazy probably because it was
a camera in front of his face
now it's my turn to have some me time
and honestly at this point I am so tired
from the day I just literally want to
fall out and just do nothing but go to
sleep you know what I think you know
what I'm just going to take enough just
to tining out I'll just wake up oh my
god what time is it oh my gosh I forgot
to take off my makeup I don't want to
but I have to I don't want to look like
extra pepperonis real might be tired
stop being a baby and just get this done
okay
I still have to wash my face let's put
this hair up and get this thing done
first makeup off oh wait these are not
the makeup wipes that I normally use
where are they
don't tell me I ran out but Caesar
Caesar still hasn't used this thing I
bought it for him so long ago oh wait I
went to CVS the other day that's right
okay I'm good to go I makeup off first
it's always the longest when I grab two
these guys one for each eye okay we
don't have to do tomorrow take Bobo to
the vet to get groomed Oudin has six
your day I'm filming a video this is why
I love this makeup wipe it removes
everything babies
is there a clean spot on this thing
almost done the power of makeup it's
almost off gotta get some of this
foundation on my neck this contour in my
ear okay time to get my pre cleanse
because I know I still have makeup on my
face I remember a so I think this was so
much work and now I love it so much it
works double duty even though I'm not
the only thing is that I always get to
stuff inside of my eyes and I feel like
I can't see any we blurry all of it you
better wash it off all right let me take
my vanity planet brush a little Skin Spa
kit I always use this brush the daily
cleansing brush I think I'm going to use
the silicon brush because it's like a
little massage on your face but the
exfoliating brush is so soft I like it
so much but I'm just gonna stick with
this one today and take my Dermalogica
cleanser because this thing has been
making my face so clear my subscribers
are so lucky they get a 70% discount off
this whole entire entity planet kit it
feels so good
yes it's like a face massage bullying my
face I'm clogging my pores and I'm
getting face massage this thing is
amazing
dark work work work work isn't it a
major Turner did she even say anything
in this matter no but I love it I wonder
if I can make a hit song and say nothing
else I don't think so no no I I can't do
that or maybe I can I don't know
okay this song is officially stuck in my
head my skin is so dry grabbing this
love this stuff so thick and creamy I'm
gonna be young forever Lee wake up with
super smooth buttery skin is buttery a
thing a descriptive word for skin or is
it just me that uses it I saw bubs
Beauty do this in a video and I've been
doing it ever since I think it really
does help with the blood flow of my skin
right so now to moisturize my undereyes
tatcha packaging is the cutest hey it's
my birthstone color I think I like the
applicator because it makes my under
eyes feel cool and then the formula is
really light so it's different and I
think that's why I'm using it so much
lately
tap-tap-tap favorite neck cream of all
time as it makes my neck feel like it's
never gonna eat it's such a light
whipped cream eformula feels so nice
get it in there let me just add a little
bit more moisture to my face
and done poof smells good
ooh I look so DUII okay now it's tea
time
this chai tea is really good too cute
ooh YUM
oh my bed finally I had such a busy day
today I think I just need to get this
day out of my head it's been so crazy
and busy and on paper though that I have
a clear head before I go to bed I just
rhymed alright I'm ready to sleep you
just take a sip of my tea tip of tea the
worst English accent I wish I had an
English accent
