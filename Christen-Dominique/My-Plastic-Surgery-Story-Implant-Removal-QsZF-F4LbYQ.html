boobies I had surgery and I got these
removed from my body I'm gonna tell you
why right now yes these were in my body
but they're clean promise and what you
need to know before going into surgery
if you want to learn about my experience
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
and hit that notification bell so you
can be a part of the quad fat don't
forget to subscribe let's get into the
video here's some footage of the actual
procedure of me walking into dr.
Barrett's office and meeting with the
team talking about what we're gonna do
before we do it let me just show you
guys how this went down the morning of
right now alright you guys so I am
walking into dr. Byrd's office and today
this is happening all right guys this is
dr. Barrett right here you guys know my
last year a camera to do my tummy tuck
and now we are doing or doing Google the
implants and also some fat from the arms
into the booth of it so I am so excited
today and I wouldn't trust anyone else
the dr. Barrett so hey guys yeah we've
been waiting for this day a long time
we're gonna make like an amazing surgery
kristin is beautiful we're just going to
do some fine-tuning things I'm gonna get
her some breasts that really match your
body using natural substances versus an
implant or so you can't wait to get
started go right in here
these are all important things this
helps prevent blood clots
we have surgical things gonna wear a cap
got a great little fancy little Hospital
booties convince them all for Australia
so we'll get you set up for that okay
and then we'll come back in when there's
no markings bringing it nice even
measurements maybe this is important
because when we do the surgery you lie
down on the table yes that's why we need
to get proper mid lines network noodle
is part of the press it's actually kind
of sometimes the hardest part of surgery
is coming up with a plan and doing a
really good argument and get you back
very soon do you have any other
questions yeah I got something so I want
to talk briefly about our operative plan
we want to harvest the fat so we can use
it for a breast augmentation and was
coming in here this is Kristin right
here so she has some extra fat girl arms
a little problem area okay in the axilla
and and also in the back we're gonna
take that fat turn her over
take out her old implants okay they are
high profile they do not match her body
and we're going to give her a slight
lift to get her to her desired size
shape proportions like these pictures
right here and we also want to get these
side boob goals here how it goes depends
on how big these implants are we really
don't know and how much natural breast
issues she had excited you president
they started to push me into the
operating room and that's when they gave
me the big nasty anesthesia the one that
puts you to sleep I was really nervous
about that but when they started the IV
there was like this Hawaiian music that
came on that was super soothing for some
reason and all I remember is waking up
and I had finished with a search
so I guess I should start off by saying
why I got my implants in the first place
some of you guys know I'm a mom some of
you that are new to my channel
hi I'm mom and I had a baby about 10
years ago exactly when you have a kid
your whole body all the skin stretches
out really bad for some it could just
pop right back into place for others
it's there's no getting it back
starting off before I had Jaden which
was my son I was a B b34 something like
that and then I had my son and I became
super engorged with milk and it was like
I was it like a D and it was really hard
really big but once you breastfeed and
everything all of the milk goes away and
your skin you're left with a saggy sock
with a tennis ball in it that's what it
looks like just to give you like a
visual there are some 60 year olds out
there that look amazing
but that's what I felt like my chest
looked like it was really stretched out
probably too and I'm wearing this top
but I was never able to wear before
because I would be like huge but my
boobs probably too buried it just looked
really really wrinkly and saggy and just
not I just did not feel attractive at
all in them it was very uncomfortable
so I finally was able to get them lifted
I think was 2015 this doctor I went to I
researched him I thought enough he was
like 5 stars Beverly Hills to LA in like
28 14 so I'm originally from Houston
Texas there's nothing like this out
there
nobody's getting surgeries done all the
time out there I'm hard anyone that I
knew so when I came out here I was like
5 stars wow this is great
and he is a good doctor really think
that if I would have just gotten the
lift I would have been happy but I
talked to him and I told him like I
don't want to be left with nothing I
don't want to be left with just like no
boobs so I guess I should have like a
small implant because I don't want to be
huge either the doctor suggested that I
get something because my chest is like a
little bit wider that would that would
fill that out I went with his suggestion
because at the time I thought okay he's
a professional let me just go with a
suggestion now that I actually went with
dr. Barrett I thinking back I'm like wow
we should have pictures of what I don't
want to look like
and what I do want to look like I should
have done that but I didn't know so I
just know what the doctor suggestion I
got the smallest he said that he would
put in my body was 300 cc's which I have
right here this big this was in my body
they're clean
my doctor cleaned them up put them in
this bag
Christon Dominique's implants this is
what was put in my body I'll get to how
they were put in just a little bit but
which was crazy that these were put in
like that once I left I immediately knew
that they were too big like I felt like
this is really huge way huger than what
I was thinking actually told my doctor I
was like I think they're really really
big not something I'm comfortable with
so he advised me to be patient and wait
as you should because they're swollen
and they will go down three years later
they never went down they went down a
little bit but three years later I was
still extremely huge I'm I couldn't fit
into any bras I was I went from a B to a
double D which was it just made
everything impossible and I would not be
able to wear like especially the shirt
I'd be busting out of this shirt right
now it just looks very uncomfortable it
didn't feel like my it fit my body or my
frame and it just felt like not me you
know I so I was just really
uncomfortable in those when I look back
they actually started to droop and look
really weird everybody said they looked
amazing but I knew that they did not fit
my body they were way too big and they
even like they started to sag in a funny
way which I didn't realize this is
probably why until until this happened
so it just made my incision you guys and
I examine the implant with you a tiny
little keyhole incision turns out the
implant is upside down which has
probably led to why this implant is so
boxy looking
rejuvenate this get this taken care of
but implant upside-down not a good sign
after a while like my skin I know my
skin it's kind of thinner so it
immediately started to droop like right
in this area it just started to sag
again not as Extreme as when I started
but it started sagging I mean it's
natural but I was very unhappy with the
way it was looking it was like a dog
year I can't explain it but it was just
like drooped over and I had to like pick
it up it was just it was you don't want
boobs like that trust me I mean for some
people they like them but the way that
they were drooping on me I just looked
so weird and when he said that it kind
of made sense like no wonder they felt
kind of funny so I don't know if he put
them in that way I definitely I would
feel like I would know if they flipped
over in my body I did not feel that at
all
so I don't know that was really really
weird I honestly thought that the doctor
put in more than what I requested is
that he said 300 I was like okay that's
like the smallest 300 but he did he put
300 I swear it was like 500 or something
because I felt like they were so huge I
guess I already had a lot of breast
tissue so it made them look even bigger
because naturally I wasn't super tightly
there I would have been happy just with
my with a regular lift and I wouldn't
probably have to come back in and do
surgery all over again when I went in
with dr. Barrett he tells you to give
him three pictures of what you want to
look like three pictures of what you
don't want to look like you know you
give side front you give him every angle
that you do and don't want to look like
so he really knows how big or how small
that you need to go you did my tummy
tuck last year and I had an amazing
experience with him he really takes use
of the process he has a really great
bedside manner his whole staff is just
sweethearts Rosalyn is the Besh's the
sweetest and I don't know they just make
you feel like you're at home so when I
thought of doing the revision I
immediately thought okay I had I had
other choices but after really thinking
it over I was like let me go with
buddy that I I know in trust so I went
to dr. Barrett to get my implants taken
out get another lift I went in knowing
that I did not want an implant at all
I've made it very known to dr. Barrett I
did not want an implant but I did know
that I was going to be completely even
flattered because after this and the
sagging I would have less breast tissue
and talking to him Mikey let me know
that I would be a lot smaller so in
because I don't want to implant we
thought of the idea of getting fat from
one area of my body or a few areas it
possibly could take fat from and inject
it into the breast so it's your natural
fat going into your boobs so so we
thought of the idea of taking the fat
from my arms which were have always been
kind of runs in my family for them to be
a little larger it's called a safe
flight bar technique where we to mess
the arms with a lidocaine and
epinephrine solution constricts the
blood vessels so we don't get any
bleeding a little less bruising and
we're going to be able to sculpt the
arms you can see she has really good
muscle tone here we're going to focus on
these fatty areas that she has here and
then also give her a nice cut are you
guys we have our fat we harvested from
the arms have a look
high-quality fat and we're going to take
it and prepare it into some syringes
that we can inject into the breast so it
is gravity filtering right now we want
to just take just the fat itself and
place it in the breast and then he
lifted he like did an incision around
and under so it's called the lollipop
listen I got the fat put in there and
even like after coming out of surgery I
felt like wow like barely thinking right
okay cuz there's a lot of drugs I go
through your body when you're in surgery
but even then I looked in the marinade
knew I always gonna be so happy with my
new boobs and even though dr. Barrett
says that you're gonna lose he warned me
50% of what I have it's only been two
weeks and they actually feel like
they're about pretty much like a big B
almost see but I know that they're gonna
go down which I'm totally fine with the
smaller for me is actually the better
yeah I'm super happy they're lifted I
feel like my self again I feel like how
I did before I had my son I just feel so
more confident in my body I feel like I
can wear anything and I just feel free
because before I felt like I was just
busting out of every top I wore I could
not wear low-cut because I'd almost feel
like I'd have boobs it wasn't a look
that I liked if you're not in LA you
don't go with my doctor make sure to
take pictures of what you want to look
like and what you don't want to look
like even if they don't ask you just so
that they have a really good idea of
what you want
because you can explain all you want
verbally but if some doctors they don't
see it physically or anybody even if for
me I think for anybody with eyes and
ears if you don't see it physically you
won't really hit the nail on the dot hit
the nail on the
I don't know something went bad I went
on a real self calm and I noticed that
dr. Barrett would answer back to some of
the questions that people asked about
procedures and that also made me feel
really confident like he he was very
like proactive in in answering questions
and he got a lot of great feedback from
a lot of people and I did my research
for sure with dr. Barrett and I just I'm
so happy that I went with him and I'm
happy that I could go through it and
tell you guys about it yeah now when I
heal I'm gonna just work out so I can
keep these arms up and make them even
better yeah so I'm really happy I hope
you guys enjoyed this video and until
the next video bye guys we're below if
you know what you would use these for I
don't know let me know hey guys welcome
back to my channel actually I should
have them this way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
