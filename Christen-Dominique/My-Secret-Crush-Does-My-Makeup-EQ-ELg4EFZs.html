media I was not like a beauty person at
all I really didn't know what I was
doing with makeup like I saw you
physically being are recreating music
leaves on his you to autumn like two
years ago yeah that's like so I just
kind of like challenges like musically
stuff I was AM user for like a hot
minute but I don't know and then I
started experimenting with makeup and
then I felt like all these beauty gurus
like Kristen Patrick Starr
nikkietutorials like everyone and so I
just kind of watch the tutorials and
started learning the ropes of stuff and
eventually I started to get better with
it and so I posted my own tutorials once
I got like a little studio I got like a
little backdrop or whatever let me take
this a little bit of shape tape so yeah
and then I just kind of fell in love
with the beauty world and especially in
the last six months my career like in
the beauty industry has really taken off
I've had to do so many exciting things
and it's so fun now I'm gonna set her
face with some Laura Mercier this stuff
is a bomb
under her eyes I really like to bake
under the eyes it's just kind of like
becoming I just got this because I said
maybe her face like I want to like see
like a little professional hundred
channel just always like struggle with
the brows and getting this shape down
but like once I can feel it looks so
that right and then I'm just taking a
little bit of shape tape and they do a
good job her filming room is so warm
like so pretty here - yeah but like when
you're like this set it's like there's a
white wall here white wall here yeah
