I've been using the octavio color safe
shampoo and it's infused with lemongrass
and chamomile so it smells really good
and it feels really suiting and I judge
this and lather it on my scalp I use the
balls of my fingers and then I follow up
with the conditioner and I use it on the
like towards the nape of my neck forming
a ponytail and I just make sure that it
absorbs while it's doing that I use my
Pacifica Hawaiian movie guava smells
amazing I dance with it I wash my body
with it it's an awesome body wash and I
wash my armpits excuse me and then I
take my invited good spin brush which is
awesome and I'm using my clear start
foaming wash I've been using this a lot
and I just take a little bit put it on
the brush head and I feel like the brush
does everything for me does all the work
it takes out the makeup in the gunk so I
love this brush guys and then I'll use
the ultimate rent remedy from shamora
it's a treatment for your hair for ultra
damaged hair and I just let that absorb
into my hair while it's doing that I use
my Kona coffee and sugar detox of body
scrub smells amazing basically like a
Vanilla creamer and I use my bigger head
whoa
to UM work that into my body again it
does all the work for me and so that's
why I love this little guy and then I go
ahead and wash out all of the
conditioner in my hair and my hair ends
up feeling really soft in just buttery
you know when you put your hands through
your hair in the shower and it feels
really velvety and soft
and okay and then I go ahead and brush
my teeth I don't do this all the time
sometimes I do it when I just want to
get out the shower get everything done
for my moisturizer I'm today I'm going
to try out the la vanilla laboratories
this is the healthy body butter in pure
vanilla it's packed with all-natural
ultra hydrating butters and natural
essential oils so it's not going to just
sit on top of your skin it's actually
going to absorb into it and just leave
your body feeling instantly hydrated
this one's from the it's equally I'm
back this month today I'm also going to
use this Jules and Esther vitamin C
serum it's supposed to even the skin
tone and minimize wrinkles so might as
well get started on that early always
good to prevent them I just take this
little bottle here take a little squirt
of it and I just apply it to my face
feels very soft and smooth afterwards
it's also very hydrating on my hair
today I'm using the kara therapy daily
soothing cream and this is a heat
activated blow dry cream so it's going
to reduce your blow-dry time and also
revives frizzy hair so that it looks
smooth and shiny most important part for
me is brushing my hair when it's wet I
use the wet brush I got this at Bed Bath
&amp;amp; Beyond for ten dollars and I use it
I've been using it for about almost two
two years and it is amazing this brush
does not hurt if you have the craziest
tangle you can brush through it with
ease I don't know how that happens or
works but it happens and you guys it's
amazing I always brush my hair when it's
wet because you don't get as much damage
when it's wet you get more damage when
you brush your hair when it's dry so I
always do that before I blow-dry it to
dry my hair I'm using the Nano moisture
infusion hairdryer
it adds volume and
- frizz and reduces damage to the hair
from brushing so I'm gonna use this guy
and comes with three nozzles I just use
the fast drying one so I can get out of
the restroom next I'm going to
straighten my hair with me megastar flat
iron from you I have the purple one and
I really like it because it adds that
sweetness and shine without damaging or
drying it too much and now I'm just
ready to start the rest of my day or
just chill base mask I kept you fearing
a face mask yes we're having a
spontaneous face mask day I'm using the
bio Republic skin care sheet mask the
one I'm going to be using is the
cucumber breeze soothing fiber mass and
what it does is locks in all the
moisture and improves your skin
elasticity
while my skin soaks up the moisture I'm
going to put on my beats music listen to
Nicki Minaj feeling myself just imagine
that song playing right now while we do
is nap chat because no YouTube won't let
me do that for you guys since we're
doing our face masks then might as well
do our nails and our makeups so I'm
going to do Sabrina's nails I'm using
the formula X four-step system
taking the cleanse nail cleanser first
and this is going to help rid our nails
of any oil and residue and then I'm
going to take the prime and what this is
is going to prevent staining and it also
acts as a natural adhesive layer after I
applied that I'm going to take the nail
color in power source and it's an extra
long-lasting shine and just paint all of
the nails except for once I'm going to
have a different color on one of the
accent nails and then I'm going to seal
it with a topcoat for the accent now I'm
going to use the aurora gel effect nail
polish and it's in the color four alarm
fire and it's shiny durable it lasts up
to two weeks which is awesome and it's
super easy to remove you like it time
for the fun part the makeup I'm going to
start off with the Smashbox cosmetics
photo finish foundation primer it's
lightweight it blends super easy into
the skin it has vitamin A and E in it
you can either wear it alone or under
foundation I really love how it just
smooths out your skin and hides your
pores
and to even out her skin tone I'm going
to apply the Armani luminous silk
foundation and as you can see it works
beautifully and for the concealer I'm
using the NARS creamy custard obviously
Sabrina really likes this one I'm going
to use it in her inner corners just to
conceal her eyes I went ahead and did
her eyes off-camera but I'm back with
her lips I'm using the j-cap Beauty lip
titude hydrating lip stain this is
highly pigmented it is hydrating but it
does have a semi matte finish and I'm
going to apply this to her lips Sabrina
and this is the final look for Sabrina's
where am I supposed to just smile
I will go with you round not food in
Dolin can you like no okay okay okay I
got these you know is it recording her
yes
I'm gonna turn and this is a final look
