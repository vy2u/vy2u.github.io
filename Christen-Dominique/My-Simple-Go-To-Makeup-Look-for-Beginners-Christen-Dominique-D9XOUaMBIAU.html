doing a super simple look for you guys
using just two shadows a purple and a
champagne color and that's pretty much
it a liner in mascara so if you like
this look then continue watching so I've
already done my foundation and my
eyebrows I'm just going to get straight
into the eye shadow
so the first shatter that I'm going to
use is from benefit it's in the color
birthday suit and it just looks like
this
and it's going to act as a really nice
warm base to our shadow I'm just going
to take it with my finger and apply it
to them
they blend that a little bit past the
priests and not all the way up to the
problem so today I'm going to be trying
out the bareMinerals the big debut I
honestly did not know what I was going
to do today but I'm tired of doing
neutrals on my channel so I'm gonna try
out this pinkish champagne color with
the purple and won't see what we come up
with so I'm going to be using this color
on the inner half of the lid and then
the purple on the outer half just
keeping it really simple today so the
next color I'm going to use is the
purple this is center stage and I'm just
going to apply that to the outer half of
my lid using a new clean shadow brush
even though it doesn't really look that
clean but it's okay so we're just going
to take some of that and apply it to the
outer hat and I really don't mind if
it's messy because I'm going to blend it
out anyways but I'm just gonna lay it
down
I haven't blended it yet I'm going to do
the other side now
oh yeah now I'm going to take a blending
brush this is an old brush and I can't
see the letters but it's from Matt it's
a 222 this is one of my favorite
blending brushes and I'm just going to
blend out the edges of this darker
shadow if you happen to lose some of the
intensity towards the ends just go back
into the darker color and apply it back
to the end of the lid so I'm going back
into the purple applying it to the end
and then blending the edges out so we
can put back some of that intensity of
the color to highlight the inner corners
in the brow bone I'm going to take the
color center stage which is the lightest
color in the palette and I'm going to
pop that into the inner corners and onto
the brow bone and of course use a clean
blending brush so that you can make sure
the transition is nice and smooth today
I'm using the Lord and berry black
pencil liner for the top lash line and
surprisingly today we are not doing a
wing I'm just going to line the upper
lash line and tight line so that my
lashes look fuller since we're not doing
lashes today either we're going super
simple today just bringing it back to
the basics today today today today
for mascara I'm using the benefit
they're real mascara and applying
generous coats to the top and bottom
lashes and I won't go into too much
detail on how to apply that because it's
pretty self-explanatory and it's gonna
be the same every time so yeah but I get
these beautiful looking lashes with this
mascara and it's definitely one of the
good mascaras that I have so far this is
the completed I look let me know what
you think in the comments this ilyich is
super easy and quick now I'm going to
move on to the contour and the blush eye
you know where it is alright so now I'm
going to do the contour and I'm going to
use my lorac tantalizer it's a
highlighter in matte bronzer duo and I'm
going to take my Mac 188 brush and take
just a little bit so I'm going to keep
this right in this area I'm not going to
go all the way down just so that it
looks natural and make sure you keep it
really close to their hairline and use a
really light hand and then I'm going to
work it around the cheekbone going up
into the temple
and now I'm just going to go down the
sides of my nose and this just kind of
if you have a wider set nose then it
just narrows it down even though my nose
is already kind of really narrow but I
feel like I have a crooked nose so I
feel like I have to do this make the
point right here but that's in the way
so now it gives you like that shadow
now I'm just gonna highlight my face and
the highlighter I'm using is the same
one from the palette and just just using
my zoeva highlight brush and number 105
by the way I love these brushes in
they're super soft you can just tell
they're high-quality brushes I'm going
to put this onto the tops of the
cheekbones where the light would
naturally hit and this side and I'm
going to go down the nose surfer blush
I'm going to use the Hikari blush in
cameo and it's a light pink color and
I'm going to apply that with my zoeva
126 cheek finish brush and I'm going to
apply that straight to the apples of the
cheek and work it back into the hairline
you watch my videos often you know that
I like to keep my blush kind of behind
my cheekbone I just feel like it gives
you a fresh youthful look I feel like
when you go too far to the front of your
face it looks it kind of dates you a
little bit it just it looks a lot better
if you try it behind the cheekbone okay
so I'm next I'm just going to moisturize
my lips with the mongongo jersey shore
sun and it is in mandarin green orange
ginger I've been obsessed with move lips
lately so I'm going to use the Gerard
cosmetics uses the color shimmer of hope
or the look
and by the way these earrings are so
cute I love dainty jewelry like this and
these are from Coriana a little crossbow
earrings
let's put wit a favorite river it won't
come out off a lot what
that's we I'm going to apply that and uh
um yeah there's going to be a lot of
outtake thank you for watching the video
