let it a new intro you know I get bored
guys welcome back to my channel since
today I'm going to be showing you my
skincare routine something that you guys
have been asking for I honestly don't
use much I don't have like an extensive
routine or I don't use a lot of masks so
it's super simple just to let you guys
know I have dry textured acne prone skin
hyperpigmentation I got it all so I'm
going to show you how I've cleared up my
skin and I'm very happy with it and if
you want to know how I cleared up my
skin don't forget to subscribe to my
channel and hit that notification bell
so you can be a part of the cause family
and without further ado we're gonna get
in to the video so the first thing I do
is wipe off my makeup and I've been
using these wipes for years you guys
want a cheaper alternative I would go to
Target get their brand that says
compared to Neutrogena makeup cleansing
towelettes it's the exact same thing I
just take it work it around my face even
though I use the wipes I feel like I
still have it removed all of my makeup
so I'll go in afterwards with the
touch-up pure one-step Camela cleansing
oil and this I feel like really gets in
there and just removes everything like
there is not going to be one trace of
makeup even if it's waterproof this will
take it out even though I use the
towelettes
I still go in and use an oil cleanser
because this thing removes everything I
used to use them micellar water and that
would work really well but I feel like
this works even better it's very gentle
on the skin and I feel like it doesn't
dry your skin out which is a problem for
me so this works really well for my skin
type and the way you want to use this is
dry hands dry face work it in after I've
taken all my makeup off then I will use
this guy right here and let me tell you
I know this is not a sponsored video at
all whatsoever nobody's paying me to do
or say anything this is just what I use
and I happen to love touches products
because they work well with sensitive
skin especially dry skin like mine it
just is a perfect match for me and I
know this because I was using it for a
while
but I get so much skin care products in
that I get really curious to see if
other products work so I went through
this phase where I was trying a bunch of
different stuff
and it was to the point where my face
was so broken out and it scared me so it
was really bad and he's a lot of help
with my skin so I went and got a facial
with yoli glow and she used the Tatra
products on my face again and she's like
what are you using and I'm like I'm
using a bunch of different things
because I get so many things I just I'm
using everything and now I don't know
what to do because my skin looks crazy
it was really bad I don't know if you go
back a couple of videos it was just like
zits popping out of my makeup everywhere
I told you Lee I'm using all these
different products I don't know what to
do now because my skin's like this and I
feel like Tasha's doesn't really do much
for my skin
and so she's like well why don't you do
this she said go back to your trusty
friend and try this guy go back to using
this to wash your face for a whole month
and let me know what happens so that's
what I did I'm like you know what I'm
gonna do that I'm gonna do it she gave
me like a travel sized version and I
took it with me when I traveled and I
was like okay this is why I used to
Tasha because my skin completely cleared
up at first I was thinking this is not I
need medical grade something for my skin
but honestly this is all I needed so I
went back and I've been using this and
my skin is still really great if I don't
keep up with it if I don't use this
consistently I will break out when I use
this very consistently with Yoli doing
my facials she does extractions on my
face and it takes out anything that
might pop up later and so everything is
very clean and when I clean my skin it's
actually getting in there and really
helping my skin improve after I take off
my makeup I will use this on my face
this is the polished gentle rice enzyme
powder so what I'll do is wet my hands
really quick pour some of the powder
into my hand as soon as you rub your
hands together it's instantly activated
by water it becomes like a very soft
creamy feeling cleanser and then I just
work it into my skin for about 30
seconds I feel like over time it evens
out my skin tone helps my hyper
pigmentation all the breakouts that I've
been going through and it just really
soothes and balances my skin and that's
why I keep going back like these are my
holy grails right here
these two guys together is magic feel
like it really has smooth out the
texture on my skin because it's a very
soft kind of exfoliator and you don't
feel any grainy pieces scraping your
skin I have to be super careful with the
products that I use on it and I can
definitely trust these two products was
so happy when I saw my face clearing up
and then once my face started clearing
up as I started getting a lot of
comments from you guys saying what are
you doing to your face it looks so good
you have to show us your skincare
routine let us know how you cleared up
your skin so I was like okay I have to
do this video I had really bad acne when
I was a teenager so like I have scarring
right here that just won't go away
unless I actually resurface my skin so I
probably will still do that I haven't
been breaking out so I might plan to do
that very soon and then your future and
I will let you guys know everything
about the process once I do if you
follow me on snapchat follow me on insta
stories if I don't post it on here on my
experience for sure I let you guys know
on snapchat and it's a story so make
sure you follow me there and so after my
skin is clean and dry I'll go ahead and
moisturize it and this is something that
I use as a nighttime moisturizer because
it is a lot thicker and consistency it's
called the herb or Ian use a sorbet
night cream and this is very thick so I
wouldn't suggest to use just during the
day smells amazing
it smells like you want to eat it and
it's made with use'
and which is a fruit it really sinks
into your skin hydrates you recharges
your skin for the next day I wake up
like feeling my skin like it's a baby's
butt if you have oily skin I wouldn't
suggest this because it's gonna feel
really heavy and slick but if you do
have dry skin like I do this is going to
work perfectly for your skin this helps
fight fine lines and aging as well or if
you have really dry skin and you just
need all the moisture that you can get I
definitely suggest this to you after I'm
done with that my face is hydrated I go
right into the under eyes and for the
under eyes I use the it confidence in an
eye cream this thing is also really
thick you can see the difference in your
under eyes when you
underneath it literally brightens your
under-eyes it brightens them anything
that brightens my undereyes I will use I
don't care I will try it I will use it
and I will let you know if it really
works or not and the one I'm about to
tell you after this works just as great
the reason why I use this at night is
because it's so thick the consistency is
so freakin thick I use this underneath
my eye like if I'm doing the Kim
Kardashian highlight I'll actually put
it underneath my eyes in a V right in
the center of my face and right on my
chin I don't know you know I just feels
like if you're gonna highlight those
places those places need to be the most
hydrated baby like flawless places on
your face this cream is for all skin
types if Brighton says you can use it
during the morning but personally I
would not suggest to use it in the
morning unless you like that heavy
feeling on your face or if you feel like
you really need the intense
moisturization during the daytime this
is something that I really like and I
feel like it makes my under eyes look
really nice and smooth so after the
under eyes are done I'm not done yet we
still have the neck I know it's so weird
you're like what are you gonna do with
your neck your neck age is so fast you
guys your neck in your hands so it is so
important for me to prevent that from
happening so I have been using this
tarte maracuja neck treatment for so
long if you look back in my old videos
anything with skincare this is gonna
meet in it I'm it is such a freaking
thick cream all these creams that I use
at night are super thick like Grandma
thick hi grandma love you I don't care
how old I am I don't care how young I am
I am gonna prevent aging at all costs
too because you know keeping up after
all that's done I'm going back in with
my tatcha
dewy skin mist so I put this on no
matter what time of day it is I'll just
spritz it on my face after I wash my
face hydrate I use the mist and it just
feels so refreshing it really brings in
that extra light layer of hydration and
then I just close my eyes and go to
sleep okay so now I'm going to go to the
daytime because the daytime I did the
nighttime because there's a lot of steps
so the daytime is basically the same
thing I use these two guys what changes
after that is what I moisturize with so
this is my daytime
cream.the use a sorbet but this is going
to fight free radicals it's gonna help
protect your skin it smells amazing I'm
almost done with it it is the lightest
feather feeling on your face it feels
like nothing and that's like my goal
during the day I don't want anything to
feel like anything on my skin you know I
just want it to disappear it's super
hydrating it protects your skins me this
dewy natural glowing look so after
that's done I'll go in with an under-eye
cream and I use the origins ginseng
refreshing eye cream and this helps
brighten your under eyes it helps a puff
everything on your face it just makes
your under eyes look amazing this also
if you put it on it's like a champagne
and it has like a little bit of shimmer
in it and it makes your under eyes
without putting makeup on just this it
helps visibly brighten your under eyes
over time I don't know if my under eyes
are getting lighter I don't honestly
don't know that but instantly it does
brighten your under eyes and it does
feel very light and hydrated so I love
that and I put this in my highlight
areas too that is my skincare routine I
feel like I don't really do too much
I've seen a lot of other skincare
routines where it's like they do mask
and they do like all these other things
I that I don't do but this is what works
for me it's pretty minimal I would think
I put on a lot of moisturizer because I
am really dry I feel like my process is
pretty simple and there's not anything
fancy about it really you're interested
in any of the products that I'm using I
will always have them listed below with
the price and the link where to get them
