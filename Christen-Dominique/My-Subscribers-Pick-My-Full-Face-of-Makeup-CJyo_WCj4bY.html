so today this is the look I have on this
is everything that you guys chose so
what I did in my last video I posted a
comment in our community chat and I
asked you guys to pick all of my makeup
that I'd be doing a video on it and this
is what you guys came up with I am very
proud of you guys right now it is so
pretty a very spring girly like this is
very me so it lets me know that we're
like the same person I love how this
came out it's so so pretty like the rose
gold the pink it's just so beautiful
perfect for spring it's soft and I just
love it and it just so happened to match
my hoodie today that I got makeup on so
try to ignore it and my nails right here
so this is perfect I love it pink is one
of my favorite colors
so other than black so I love how this
came out if you guys want to see what
you chose are what I chose from what you
listed then keep watching just to see
also how we got this beautiful look I'm
obsessed with this look I'm wearing it
again just to let you guys know but I'm
gonna go ahead and show you how to get
this look but before we get into the
video don't forget to subscribe to my
channel if you're not if you just want
like passing by go ahead and subscribe
hit the button it's free and don't
forget to you hit the notification bell
so you can be a part of the quad family
and without further ado let's get into
so to prime the face you guys chose the
far Sally unicorn essence drops this
right here I don't think I've ever used
this on my channel it looks like this
it's like a pink liquid with all these
glitter and shimmers in it it's really
pretty so I'm gonna put that on my face
first I actually got some extractions
fun too so there's more of these little
red dots than usual and then I think
Sims something bit me right ear so I
have a huge unicorn we're gonna call it
a unicorn today so the next thing that
I'm going to use is the huda beauty
foundation I actually I've only used
this I think one time on my channel just
to try it out so now I'm going to just
put this
in this random spot pick it up with my
beauty sponge and see how this
foundation is I don't know why I stopped
using it
oh wow this has a very strong like rose
scent floral and actually it does this
was gonna be darker but it's pretty
light so I'm gonna try to pretend like
this is actually my skin color when it's
not it's only like this because I can
see how my neck is super dark honestly I
have another color let me go get that
one because this is really light I don't
know how far off this is going to be but
I'm gonna take this one this is called a
latte 300 and and it still looks pretty
light there's a really good tanning job
yesterday I'm gonna set my eyes with
foundation today foundation is pretty
light I know it's supposed to be full
coverage the only thing that's bothering
me about it is that it doesn't really
match my skin tone right now alright so
I'm gonna go in with the Anastasia brow
definer on my community like chat there
was anything I think it was just aa
Nastasia brow product so this is the
only color I had that matched my brows
slightly so this is the brow definer in
chocolate from Anastacio so I'm gonna go
ahead and leave it like that with
eyeshadow palettes I saw that - you guys
chose the Kylie X Kourt pink eye shadow
palette which is super cute love the
packaging palette itself is very neutral
has really pretty shimmers and then one
matte shade right here that I could use
in the crease are all over the eye and
then you guys also wanted the honest
Asya prism palette which looks like this
and it has a bunch of different colors
to choose from so I was thinking of
using both of them together just to be
fair to you guys so I'm gonna go ahead
and pick up the first shade in this
palette which is this matte one right
here looks like that so I'm gonna pick
that color up and just work it into the
crease
this is a really pretty color actually
this would look really nice on its own
with just a pop of one of those shimmers
in the palette I like the color a lot
what I'm gonna do is pop on the crease
ler right here this like mobby color
right there under work that on the outer
crease just to bring some definition out
here now I'm gonna use this color is
calling my name so I'm going to use this
guy over here yeah so I'm gonna take
that I'm actually gonna put it on with
my finger it's like a really pretty gold
rose gold kind of color and I'm gonna
start with the center of my lid and you
know what I'm gonna bring it all the way
in and I'm gonna stop right before I get
to that Mavi shade wow this is really
really pretty I know I'm not using the
entire Anasazi palette actually I might
use a few more shades but this
combination right here is beautiful I
love it it's just like angelic and fairy
vibes it's very spring and soft I like
it
so I'm gonna go ahead and take Lucid
from the Anastasio palette so I'm going
to take my tiny little brush right here
pick some of that up and I'm gonna focus
this mostly like right on the arch do
you want to blend it out so I'm going to
take this brush and just soften the
edges whew I like that really pretty I
did not think of using this combination
to I was like I wouldn't have thought of
using this if it wasn't for you guys so
thank you
I was like a shift it would go really
pretty shift to it I don't want to take
this color out too far they just want it
to be like a soft hint
whenever I kind of just like turn my
head so I'm gonna soften it out with
this brush and then blend it through
so for liner you guys went with this one
right here this is the Smashbox X lotta
petal metal liquid eyeliner and I think
this is more like a black with rose gold
flecks in it I was like really pretty
like almost
well soft pink rose gold glitter
throughout if I were doing this look I
would stick with everything that I have
on my eye right now except I would go
with a soft brown eyeshadow and just
smoke it out actually you know what I'm
gonna do you guys I'm gonna take the
brown from this palette the Anasazi
palette and I'm gonna take the eyeliner
right on top of the brown you'll see
what I'm talking about in just a second
but I'm gonna take this guy right here
it's called parallel brown the dark
brown and I'm gonna take a little brush
like this is the pinpoint concealer but
I'm use it as an eyeliner brush from
Sigma
okay for the lower lash line I'm gonna
take ler right here this color and I'm
gonna work that on the entire lower lash
line and then to soften out the edges
I'm gonna pick up that same color we use
from the court the matte shade with this
brush right here this is a makeup shock
t67 brush and I'm just gonna go right
underneath and soften it up I'm gonna go
ahead and take push or daimond one of
the two I'm gonna put that on the lower
inner corner like where the tear ducts
are likes to soften out those edges just
a clean brush and that is it for the
shadow so now I'm gonna go into this
rose gold eyeliner from Smashbox X
Velata looks like so isn't that so
pretty so I'm just gonna do a soft
little wing I'm gonna try to do the
softest wing that I can possible I
honestly do not want to overpower this
Brown but this is a very black eyeliner
okay I'm just gonna stop it right about
there and let the brown keep going like
that so it's not super intensely black I
don't want it to be like an intense
liner the next request I had was to use
the milk makeup push mascara put that on
my lashes just coat them up I've heard
some people say that it helps their
lashes look so much longer I like how
the brush is very soft like the bristles
are soft they're close together they're
grabbing like every single which is cool
and then for the lashes you guys are
just saying - there wasn't any specific
lashes that you wanted me to use it just
says flirty fluffy lashes this is from
the Lily lash Sephora collection so look
like that
these lashes are so surprisingly fluffy
and flirty I feel like this is the
perfect lash that you guys described and
I think they're my new favorite I'm so
glad I tried them out this is the eye
look I love it it's super simple very
spring and pretty I ended up really
really liking this now I was a little
nervous I'm like what in the heck am I
gonna do with just this neutral palette
in one matte shadow so the next product
you guys chose was this one right here
this is the Kylie skin concealer looks
like so I chose ivory for my dark under
eye circles and we're gonna try that out
I've only tried this one time too and I
don't know why I didn't want to use it
again so let's just see kind of the same
thing with the huda beauty let's just
see what's going on with this guy I like
the way it applies to the skin is very
smooth and soft on the eye I'm gonna
also put it right in here I'm obsessed
with this I look like this gold pink
color is so beautiful the concealers not
bad it feels light too if those light on
the skin it's definitely covering up I
think it's just something about it not
being a WOW factor for me I don't know
maybe I just need a little more coverage
in the concealer because I have some
heavy duty under eye circles lately
alright so for the setting powder I'm
really excited you guys chose this
because it's the hourglass translucent
setting powder the veil I cannot wait to
try this out very cool packaging well
looks like I'm gonna fishbowl you see
that I'm gonna put the top back on and
shake it up oh cool I thought it's gonna
be a big mess but because it's a bowl it
just kind of holds everything that's
cool so I'm gonna try that with my
Beauty Blender
you set the under eyes I've heard good
things about this powder I just haven't
got around to trying it I'm glad you
guys recommended this to me bake our
under eyes so we don't have any creases
in our lines or anything like that then
I'm gonna bake this way as well just so
I can give myself a little tiny facelift
you make everything look snotch like an
alien and I'll let that sit there I like
the way this like glides on your skin
it's some powders are very chalking like
powdery it's a powder but this one just
went on very smooth I like it and just
like glide it on my skin now that we're
here I'm gonna go on its you the Urban
Decay shapeshifter palette which I
tried before I don't know how you felt
about it so I'm back again here in this
place because you guys wanted me to try
it so here we go we're gonna try this
guy out and I'm gonna take this shade to
contour my face start right here I mean
it shows a lot my cheeks and work my
brush upwards now I'm gonna snatch my
nose I'm gonna take that same shade and
go right down this side
then there's this yellow kind of powder
that I love to use on to brighten my
undereyes so before I do that I'm gonna
wipe off this extra powder that I have I
really like how this brighten my under
eyes really good
oh it's settling right here a little bit
but it is very brightening Wow also when
you do like some baking right underneath
your contour it just makes it look a
little bit more sharp if you do a little
too much you can always take a brush and
just move it upwards with a clean brush
or the brush that you're cleaning off
your bake with so I'm gonna take the
yellow shade right here I love to
brighten my under eyes with this type of
color I'm gonna take it on my nose and
like right on the tip and down and then
go over lightly with a Beauty Blender so
it looks more natural and then on my
under eyes I'm gonna take it and
brighten up the under eyes Wow usually
you guys if you watch many videos a lot
you know I use the Kat Von D shade +
light powder but this one is actually
good I don't know why I wasn't feeling
it at first but I really like it right
now I really like how this looks this
also has a highlight in it and it kind
of matches my eyes looks like that's
right here that's like a pink gold
iridescent
reflect to it I'm gonna put that on my
high lady spots and I'm also gonna apply
that to my cheeks wow this is such a
beautiful highlight this is actually one
of my favorite looks it's really soft
wearable I feel like with this pinky
gold reflecting eyeshadow and highlight
I feel like a little angel a baby girl
angel I love it it's so pretty I'm gonna
go ahead and take the bronzer because
you guys didn't really say much about a
blush but you guys did mention this
bronzer from Marc Jacobs it's the Omega
bronze the tan trick bronzer that I
always always use well I don't know if I
always use it in my videos but I
definitely use it when I'm off camera so
I'm gonna take this bronzer and just
warm up the face bring it into the
hairline really good right on the outer
perimeter of the face just warm it up
put it in the microwave and then for
lips so when you guys suggested the Marc
Jacobs slow burn
lick you also suggested the lipliner in
the gloss but I don't know where that's
at right now but I do have the lipstick
so this is actually perfect for this
look so going to apply right now dang
you guys are good like this is such a
good match the entire look is all you
guys you guys basically just did my
makeup and I liked it the last thing
that you guys mentioned for me to use
was the Mac prep and prime fix plus gold
lights so shake this guy up and pop it
on actually you use this once in a video
so somebody musta liked it I almost
forgot something oops my bad so I know
there was like a really pretty highlight
in there but we're gonna have to use
another one because you guys suggested
this venting Beauty kilowatt highlighter
you didn't say like which one but you
just said kilowatt highlighter venti
Beauty so I chose this one this is mean
money
I'm just gonna mix both of those up and
then pop it right on top we're just
gonna layer our highlights today and
it's like a really pretty peachy one so
it works out I'm just gonna look a glowy
today which I'm not mad at and that is
the final look
thank you guys for watching I hope you
enjoyed this video if you did don't
forget to give me a big thumbs up and
before I let you go I just want to
remind those of you guys out there
there's some people out there that just
are really afraid of showing their
weakness or showing that they have a
soft side or just not showing their
feelings truly so you keep things inside
and you let it build up and you don't
let it out and sometimes people can fall
apart and just lose their mind that way
that's when you start to become
depressed and just sad about yourself so
I just want to let you guys know out
there that you're human let your
emotions out don't be afraid to speak
how you feel inside it's perfectly
normal I love you guys I know there's
some of you out there that need that I'm
here for you I'm your friend thank you
for visiting my little home on YouTube
and I will see you in my next video bye
