just kind of sit there for a little bit
and just scrolled through Instagram
Twitter reply back to YouTube comments
and it's just see what's going on in the
online world and then I feel myself out
of bed and head to the restroom but to
get ready for the day
I hate the taste of my breath in the
morning so the first thing that I do is
go and brush my teeth after I brushed my
teeth and brushing my breath I just
clean my face really quick and then
moisturize today I'm going to be using
the ginseng refreshing eye cream and
this eye cream gives you like an
immediate jolt of energy hydration it's
gonna help with your dark circles and
the puffiness it's great for the morning
and it also helps just brighten and give
my under eyes an even tone I also wanted
to say thanks to origins creators of the
ginseng collection as well as if see for
partnering up with me in this video now
I'm gonna make my bed because when I
make my bed in the morning I feel like
I've done a small accomplishment and it
just sets the tone for the entire day to
continue accomplishing things I usually
leave my workout clothes the night
before ready to go so I don't have to
think about it it just motivates me to
actually go that day and it really does
help
normally my routine would be to go feed
Jaden and boba but it's just boba today
because Jaden is with his cousin's today
and last night so he's having his own
little fun time and I get to just focus
on a little bit faith she usually makes
tons of mess in the morning because her
face is so flat it's hard for her to eat
and then we just grab our water bottles
and head out to the gym
by the time I get back I am so ready for
a shower he's just breaking in one of my
PR packages and then I am heading it to
the restroom because I bake once
I smell like a clean human again I've
showered I've done my hair I head to the
kitchen because by this time I am
starving and the Caesar has made
breakfast for this morning he usually
does make breakfast he looks like his
things and then I grab my favorite
summer drink right now which is the iced
coffee from Starbucks
either the vanilla one or the caramel
macchiato both of those are my favorite
they're super yummy you guys have to try
them I got them at my local Ralph's just
in case you guys were wondering I almost
forgot my straw I always drink with this
straw because my teeth are a little bit
sensitive Caesar never drinks with a
straw this is a fun fact about Caesar he
does not like straws and he didn't tell
me that I had this big round piece of
hair just flapping on my head the entire
time but you know what we're just gonna
go with it we'll just that you're and
talk eat and kind of plan out the day
and see what we have in store for the
day and I'll just be super annoying and
mushy that you know that's just me he's
total opposite bits okay now it's time
for me to get my face ready for the day
so I'll just grab my comfy boba inspired
pillow and I'll flop it down or right in
front of my mirror this is where I love
getting ready because I have that
natural lighting and you think I want to
get ready in my makeup room but I never
do so I this is just like the best place
for me to get ready right here it's my
comfort zone can't we just talk about
how adorable this bag is this month it
is so freakin cute I can't with it first
thing I'm gonna grab out of the bag is
the japonesque Velvet Touch primer this
primer is so good I own the full second
one it makes your skin it's super smooth
in this summertime if I'm just running
errands not going to any events or
anything like that and want my skin to
feel lightweight and just look natural
and
healthy so I'm gonna take that origins
ginseng SPF 40 tinted moisturizer dot it
on my face and then work it in it works
really well with your natural skin tone
and it just perfects revives tired
looking skin it's super lightweight so
it feels really good and the ingredients
help energize the skin with a hint of
radiance literally it's just like a soft
dewy look it's so pretty the key
ingredient is caffeine which is from
coffee beans it's a natural anti
irritant that's known for its energizing
benefits and this is gonna help keep
your skin healthy and just feel really
refreshed I'll have the link listed
below in the description in case you
guys want to check it out or anything in
this video mix I'm just going to cover
my under-eye circles so I'm gonna take
this concealer I'm gonna work it into
the very inner corners of my under eyes
because that's where it be scariest and
then I'm gonna lightly Pat my finger
right on top of it and work it out to
the tops of the cheekbones and then to
fill in my brows I'm going to use the
precisely my brow pencil from benefit
and I'm in shade number five and then
for my eye shadow today I'm going to use
the color pop Karrueche palette in femme
Rosa to create the winged today I mean
Stacy got a London wonder wand gel coal
eye red liner and I'm gonna work that on
my lash line
now I'm grabbing my mascara so I can
coat my lashes and prep them for falsies
the tie the look together I'm going to
create a soft shadow under the lash line
with the iby beauty crease brush and
then I'm gonna take my Seraphine
botanicals lychee and gold blush just
for the cheeks so that I can be a glow
nup adult today I'm gonna take the Nomad
cosmetics illuminating highlighter and
pop that on my cheekbones I just spritz
it on some of the elsi Hydra enhancer
and then for the lips I'm taking my
Jada's beauty liquid lipstick in
shalalala and then I'm gonna go figure
out what I'm gonna wear today I usually
pick out my outfit and then go look in
the mirror to see that everything looks
right you know when you're you don't
look in a full-length mirror like things
just look different in your head while
I'm here and if I really like that
outfit I'll take a note and then I'll
just head out and run my errands for the
day thank you guys so much for watching
