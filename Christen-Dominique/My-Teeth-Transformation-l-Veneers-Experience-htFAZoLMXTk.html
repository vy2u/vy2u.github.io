today I'm gonna be talking to you about
my teeth I've gotten so many questions
about them so I decided to make this
video for you explaining my process and
experience with veneers so let's get
started I was talking to my dentist
about a few concerns I had about my
teeth for one I would grind my teeth a
lot so it was so bad that like I was
chipping away little tiny pieces of the
lower parts of my teeth so I was looking
at you been another concern I had was
that they were really yellow and no
matter how much I whitened them they
weren't getting as white as I wanted
them and they were really sensitive
because of all the whitening I was doing
another problem I had was that these two
front teeth were turned inwards which
braces would be able to help that great
but they would still be an even from all
of the grinding of the teeth so after
talking to my dentist I decided that
veneers would be the best thing for me
it would help the whitening of the teeth
also it would make my capable even my
dentists is based in LA if you're
interested in having a consultation with
her she'd be happy to make one she's
done several of these procedures so even
celebrities so you're in good hands if
you go to her I love how friendly she is
and how easy she makes you feel about
the process I honestly was kind of
scared about even thinking about getting
veneers this is the thought of Shaving
your teeth was super scary I even heard
that they shaved him down to like
piranhas pointy teeth which is not true
uh-huh so I was really scared whenever I
first talked to her about it she made me
feel at ease about it she looked at my
teeth and she suggested what she thought
was best for them yours would take about
two weeks in total to have them
completely fixed whitened and just the
way that I wanted them so I decided to
do veneers because the braces would fix
them it would take a little bit longer
and it would still be an even
bottom so this is why I got my veneers
and I'm going to show you the process I
actually documented videotape my second
day we're here at this just enter this
is so cute like a fun vibe look to it
super cute
this is the waiting room right here to
be working on me today my dentist dr.
Roman and she can we do my veneers today
they are amazing very kind-hearted
people and they just make the whole
process a lot easier because I'm super
like I hate going to the dentist
honestly before I went to this dentist I
was like the noises the sounds oh I
couldn't stand it I didn't like the
dentist but they make you feel so calm
and so I eat that I don't mind going so
the second visit was to get my temper a
reason so on this visit you're basically
walking down the color that you want
your veneers to be and also it's getting
your temporary then we're going to get
to do the exciting part together when
she's choosing the color your veneers
are going to be made by one of our best
most amazing lot DaVinci you're going to
absolutely love it you're in charge of
the color though okay I will lead you
through it and I want you to take a look
and see how I do you actually want your
team to be are you looking to have the
Hollywood smile are you looking to have
a natural mom I'm going to start with is
putting the area to escape for you okay
I don't will be numb but
we'll be awake you will be absolutely a
way of it where we'll be I'll be doing
the talking I love my job because you'll
be very comfortable you will not be

and we're going to go ahead prep the
teeth get you ready take the impressions

will be delivered about two weeks from
now we'll be finalizing and delivering
the final figures for you okay yeah cool
that's exciting off shop does it say on
the beginning temporaries you will be
getting some time varies and with
temporaries you have to be careful I
mean you've gotta yes you gotta watch
what you eat you cannot fight on
anything hard because we we make it to
look good but not that strong because we
want it easier to remove them on your
appointment when you come back that part
was a little bit difficult for me just
because I like to eat a lot okay so I
just don't buy them now well I cut
things to little pieces and you know
here's your fork yeah just and if we can
rush him to get him back earlier we
would love to do that for you okay cool
so get her ready and I'll be right back
me here we go guys and I'm just gonna
ask if you wanted to wear goggles
because water sprays yeah look golly
we're going to start with whitening your
teeth okay
and I'm should I take a look and see
what shape they are right now so right
here they're whitening the bottom teeth
so that they can match the top teeth all
right a little bit
topical on your gums which is going to
give you thankfully sensation okay and
then after that I'm going to go ahead
numb the area felt funny but you're
going to be okay
so we're taking a finally pressure right
now and we're getting ready to send it
out to the lab and after this we're
going to attempt rise your teeth and
you'll be done for today so you want to
eat really small juice smoothies and
that's for about two weeks and then your
porcelain veneers come in and this is
the exciting part today is the day I'm
getting my veneers I cannot wait look at
my teeth to get a good look at them cuz
they will not be the same remember it
let's look at the new ones so excited
okay thank you
is she
have a seat or your nice and comfortable
put the gums and the teeth to sleep
we're going to remove the temporaries
and then we're going to go ahead and
cement them and you're going to walk out
of here in about an hour with a gorgeous
beautiful smile again
all right I can't feel my live it feels
like marshmallow faces on my food so
what they do is they numb your mouth
with this gel and then they inject you
in the gums and it totally numbs your
mouth I couldn't even feel my nose that
much so it feels kind of funny but you
don't feel anything which is great so
they biome down pretty minimal and
rounded so that the veneers could fit in
nice and eat it I got the first eight
senate teeth put in and it stopped right
here so the very back teeth are my two i
didn't really find that area very much
so i let that as it was and now they're
like this i'm really happy with them
then look a lot brighter and straight I
know some of you guys are gonna think oh
my god you're crazy why did you do this
to your teeth they looked great before
but I did have these issues with them
that you guys wouldn't know about until
I actually tell you about it
I feel better about them I'm happy with
the choice that I made and they're not
uneven and they're white so yeah I like
them a lot I hope this video is helpful
and informative for you guys if you're
interested in veneers then I'll have my
doctors information listed below so if
you have any more questions if you want
