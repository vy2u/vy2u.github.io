mornings are my favorite part of the day
their time where I can just have some
time to myself and do the things that I
love but before I do anything else I
have to wash my face and this is what
really wakes me up
it gets my eyes open at least and then
I'm just going to go ahead and head over
to the kitchen to have some breakfast
which is another favorite part of my
morning breakfast and avocados you can't
go wrong with them today I'm gonna make
avvocato toast and for avocado toast
it's pretty easy you just make it into
wakka moly basically put a little lime
in it salt pepper and then you toast the
bread that you want to use and then
you're done if you want to put an egg on
it or whatever you can it's so good you
guys need to try it let me know if you
guys do trans things that I enjoy doing
in the morning are pretty quiet and
simple for instance admiring Boba's cute
little fluffy she just makes me smile
every time I look at her but come on
look at that face she's so cute
part of my morning routine is having a
warm beverage either tea or coffee but
today I have chosen tea because I have
been obsessed with this David's tea in
chocolate macaroon it's so yummy it
tastes like it it smells like it it's
very addicting I think it's good to
disconnect from social media and online
for at least an hour a day for me it's
usually in the morning time and during
this time I'll read a book or I'll look
outside this is basically Boba's life
she loves to look outside enjoy the Sun
and the trees her hobby I am that crazy
cat lady when it comes to the weekends I
like for my makeup to be simple and
fresh so I'll just put on liner brows
Foundation and a gloss I find myself
using glosses more often I feel like
they're coming back which is a really
good thing I just I still use my liquid
matte lip ease but I'll throw on a gloss
on top I feel like it gives your look an
extra pop when it comes to my outfits my
main goal is to feel comfortable in what
I'm wearing but I also want to look cute
so I've put something together that I
feel makes me happy and it usually
involves a t-shirt and this one is pink
it's from H&amp;amp;M and I'm also wearing a
choker chokers are very much in style
right now I think they're super cute
this one's from ireenie collection and
now it's time to head out into the day I
love my Nikes I wear them almost every
day pretty much every day unless I'm
going to an event I feel like I can do
anything in them I just feel so
comfortable you've probably seen me wear
this long gray cardigan is so many times
I have it on my Instagram pretty often
that's because it's so cozy it's
forgiving you can wear anything
underneath this and you will look so
cute you'll feel so good in it and this
is pretty much what I wear every
weekends to do
is Caesar get those camera something
that makes me super happy is getting
boba hence the name of my little baby
cat at home I named her after boba
because I loved it so much my favorite
flavor is taro milk tea Cesar likes to
get the almond milk tea and I don't know
something about the purple the flavor
the sweetness and the little squishy
Bobo balls in there it just makes me so
so happy I have another one in my hand
but Cesar can't be in the shot with me
cos he's currently behind the camera and
now I'm just having some girl time we're
gonna have dinner with my friend Laura
and in case you're wondering because
this video is almost over I am NOT
spending time with Jaden in this video
because he's in Houston for three weeks
with his grandparents and I miss him so
much but he will be back very very soon
thank you guys for watching this video I
love you so much and I hope you have an
amazing weekend comment below what you
like to do on the weekends bye dollies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
