you my current winter shower routine
to start off my shower routine I like to
turn on my Pandora and listen to my
music
I been take off my makeup from the day
and here I'm using my Willa lavender
gentle cleansing face towelettes just
glides the makeup a write-off now to
turn on my shower using lukewarm water
too hot of a shower even though it feels
good is bad for your skin especially in
the winter it really just strips your
skin of its moisture and leaves your
body and scalp dry
I first use my shampoo and currently
I've been using head and shoulders for
my dry scalp problem I worked this in my
massaging my scalp with my fingertips
trying not to scratch my scalp I used to
do this often which would give me the
worst dandruff so I try to avoid that
after I wash out my shampoo I use my
head and shoulders conditioner and I
start by grabbing my hair at the nape of
my neck in a ponytail just placing it in
my hair and then gently running my
fingers through my hair waiting a few
minutes and while I wait I wash my face
with my Murad cleansing foam wash
after I've washed out my conditioner
I'll then work in a deep conditioner
here I'm using the Brio geo which locks
in moisture for the rest of the day
I'll wait three to five minutes so
during this time I'll start to wash my
body and I use two body washes the first
one I'm using is from soft soap it's
this juicy pomegranate mango infusion
with moisture beads and then I'll follow
up with my faith aromatherapy anti-aging
sugar scrub this will help lock in the
moisture and keep my skin hydrated I
like to focus this on my elbows and
knees the places that tend to get a
little bit more drier than the rest of
my body
after this I'll apply my favourite body
wash as of now and then in its Olay
moisturizing wash
all right so some time has been killed
and we're now ready to wash out our deed
conditioner so now it's time to dry up
it's best to Pat skin dry as opposed to
rubbing it rubbing can irritate your
skin especially dry or sensitive skin as
well as whisk away all of the beneficial
moisture you just put into it now it's
time to moisturize first I'm using my
balanced here is Volney a organic body
balm I like to focus this on my more
drier areas of my body and it leaves my
skin smooth and not greasy so I really
enjoy this body balm and then I
moisturize with my favorite lotion from
the Victoria's Secret collection in pure
seduction another must-try product it's
so amazing I love the smell then i'm
waster eyes my lips now i'm applying my
face lotion from a nourish organic and
then with my Apotheker bright skin serum
I apply this all over my face before I
start my makeup to correct any uneven
tone and discoloration now I start my
hair routine with a deep conditioning
spray by Robert Ramos and in argan oil
from sexy hair if you want a detailed
video on my hair care let me know and I
can make one for you after that I blow
dry my hair make sure to use hot and the
cold air and quickly straighten it and I
make sure at the tips I kind of bump
them in so it looks a little bit more
healthier
lastly I'll apply my everyday makeup and
I just uploaded my everyday makeup look
so you can check that out the link is at
the end of this video I hope you enjoyed
the video as much as I enjoyed making it
for you and hopefully you got a few new
tips out of it as well don't forget to
find the beauty and something or someone

Dolly's
