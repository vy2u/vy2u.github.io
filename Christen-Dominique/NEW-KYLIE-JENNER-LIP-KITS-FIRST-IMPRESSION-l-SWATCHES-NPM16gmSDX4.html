back to my channel so today I am going
to be doing something a little bit
different I'm gonna be reviewing and
swatching the new Kylie lip kits these
are the three new ones that just came in
dirty peach brown sugar and love bites I
asked you guys on snapchat because I was
doing a PR unboxing and I got these I
was like how would you guys like me to
reveal these to you guys and on Twitter
you guys said I should do it on YouTube
so I'm here doing my first review and
swatch of of the Kylie lip kits or first
review swatch and my entire youtube life
so let me know if you guys like these
kind of videos if you want to see more
of them also I'm going to be on style
for live tonight it's a show on
amazon.com it's all things beauty and
fashion and I'm going to be showing a
how to make your lips look bigger it's a
contour hack for your lips so it'll be
really fun to show you guys if you guys
want to see it it's from 9 p.m. Eastern
Time and that is tonight so go check it
out if you want to see how I feel about
these kind of lipids or if I like them
or not
Nicki bought the first one I'm gonna
pick up because this is the one that
draws my eyes in and it's super popular
I've seen it on Instagram a bench so I
am going to pick this one up this is the
Kylie matte liquid lipstick and lip
liner and dirty peach I like that name
anything that's peachy it attracts me I
don't know why so the Kylie lip kit
obviously looked like this and it says
dirty peach here this is supposed to be
the shade that's around the lips and on
top of the box it looks like this inside
it has the matte liquid lip
the the lip pencil I find with the other
lip kits that the lip pencil is slightly
different than a matte liquid lipstick
I'm gonna go in with this is my my lip
band-aid so I'm gonna go ahead and put
this on my lips and it's not sticking
also if you can excuse Debra she is on
my face I like the way the lip liner
feels it feels really smooth and creamy
it just glides on it feels so nice on
your lips it's not hard or doesn't tug
it's just really smooth and buttery on
the back of the box it has Kylie's tips
on how to apply it and it says to fill
in your lips with a lip liner then top
with one coat of the matte liquid
lipstick I'm going to fill in my entire
lips and then imma show you the color of
the lip I feel like it tends to be a
little different so I let's see what it
looks like just by it so I can wear this
as a matte lipstick because it's so
creamy and buttery and you don't usually
get that with a lip liner it's usually a
little tough I don't feel it with this
lip pencil so I would just wear this by
itself so now I'm gonna go ahead and lay
one coat of the matte liquid lipstick on
top it has a really interesting scent it
doesn't smell great but it doesn't smell
awful either I don't know what it smells
like scent to it that I don't
particularly care for but I'm gonna go
ahead and swatch the lip okay so this is
definitely a little bit lighter than the
lip pencil very smooth this is a really
pretty color I feel like this is great
for the upcoming cooler month and it's
already dry what the heck I just put
this on my lips okay one thing that I
noticed is that it dries extremely fast
but it doesn't feel drying on your lips
it feels comfortable it doesn't feel
like it's pulling or tugging on your
lips it feels you have nothing on your
lips which is great and I love the color
it's a little more muted in dark so it's
gonna look really good with our fall
looks I'm very happy with this color and
the way it feels it feels amazing and
it's it's really pretty so the next
lippy I'm gonna do is a love bite
I feel like love bite is going to be
something that everybody's gonna love
it's perfect for fall that plummy
color that everybody kind of looks for
during the fall seasons so I'm going to
go ahead and swatch the lip liner crayon
and looks like this I love that this
glides on like a lipstick it's just so
easy and smooth this is a really pretty
Bambi shade that I feel like a lot of us
are going to love especially because of
the fall season I'm going to go ahead
and take the liquid lipstick and apply
it right on top I feel like this color
would look really good with a grey
smokey eye shadow when we're really
pretty
and it's very opaque there's no
streakiness I'm just in love with how it
feels when you put it on it doesn't feel
dry it doesn't feel like sticky or too
slippery it's just the most smoothest
glide on your lips and after about maybe
10 seconds it completely dries this lip
makes me want to play ariana grande's
dangerous woman it's giving me those
vibes right now I like it the next shade
I'm going to move on to is brown sugar
I'm not typically drawn to these shades
like this shade right here but let's see
how it looks so I'm going to take the
lip liner which is like this and I'm
going to start to line my lips
personally I've never been a fan of
brown lips on my skintone but we're
gonna give this a chance for some reason
this one feels a little dry it feels a
little different from the other lip
liner I don't know why so this is just
the lip liner leave a comment down below
with how you feel about the brown sugar
well I guess let me go ahead and put on
the matte liquid lipstick first I feel
like this has a yellow undertone I'm not
crazy about this is an interesting color
and I think you can see on my face that
it's not like my favorite color to be
honest but maybe because I'm not used to
it I don't know either way I just I'm
not comfortable in the shade I just want
to take it off your thoughts on it let
me know in the comments what you think
about brown sugar um it's a little bit
sticky in a tiny bit streaky you know
one thing that annoys me about the Kylie
lip liners the tops do not fit like they
just slide right off all the tops do the
same thing I feel like they need to be
fitted thank you guys watching I hope
