watch Family Guy and go to sleep that is
my life it's welcome back to my channel
and happy almost New Year's we are
getting ready for New Year's Eve tonight
and no I am NOT naked I'm wearing this
shirt right here that you cannot see
through the entire video almost the end
of the year and it's really crazy how
fast time went by just it just flew by
my face I am creating this smokey
glittery very like sultry wing I ended
up making this a black glitter wing I'll
show you how I did it in the video but
it just reminds me of one of those
sequins pillows that you can kind of
like change the color on you know what I
mean and like make it's a thing I was
kind of experimental with it but after
everything was done I was like you know
what this is beautiful I'm so excited
for you guys to try this look also to
let you guys know this is going to be
the last video of 2017 for me so I want
to let you guys know that I really
appreciate each and every one of you and
those of you who are new to my channel

my little family here on YouTube it
makes me so happy just to have you guys
you guys are the best supporters ever I
just get so much love from you guys I
love you so much with all my heart and
you make me so happy and you encouraged
me to go further with myself with my
career and with my videos so thank you
guys so much I love you and if you want
to learn how to get this glittery glam
smoked out look don't forget to
subscribe to my channel and hit that
notification bell so you be a part of
the quad family and without further ado
let's get on with this video so I've
already prepped my skin I've done my
brows I'm gonna get straight into the
eyeshadow today so I'm gonna go in I'm
gonna prime my eyes with the NARS
radiant creamy concealer this is the
shade medium one custard and I'm gonna
use that as a base for my eye shadow
just so that it lasts longer and this
concealer does increase so is this one's
gonna be really good to use
and eyeshadow base I'm also very happy
that I got to partner up with NARS in
this video for their radiant creamy
concealer because I love them so much so
I am so happy to partner with them so
this is the violet boss hash tag palette
I'm gonna use fresh right here to just
set the concealer on my eyelids and make
sure the eyeshadow goes on evenly all
over the lid without skipping I'm gonna
take this palette right here from a dose
of colors this is the blushing berries
palette I'm gonna take this shade right
here this is berry sheet and I'm just
gonna use a fluffy brush just to work
that in the crease area of my eye just
working in back and forth like that in
circular motions a lot of you have been
asking what brushes I use you want me to
let you know what brushes I'm using as
I'm doing my makeup so and I don't
really do that as often so I want to
make an effort to try and mention that
for you guys so the brush I'm using here
is Lamora it's a crease brush it's
called the 1 1/2 and I actually don't
know where I got this and it looks like
I used it so I don't know but I'm gonna
go ahead and take that crease brush and
just sit my hand on the back of the
brush so that the brush moves along my
eye a little bit easier and I have less
control over it so the eye shadow is
going to blend a lot smoother that way
and I'm using these little circular
motions to do that and I'm extending it
all the way out to the end of the brow
and because there's no Browns in this
palette I want a hint of brown in the
crease so I'm gonna go back into my
hashtag palette from violet boss and I'm
gonna take a sauce which is this one
right here and work it all the way
through the crease just like that and
it's going just below the blushing sheet
color and this is basically setting up
that transition shade this is what's
gonna make the eyeshadow look like it's
seamless so I like to take my time on
the crease shade and sometimes I use
like 2 to 3 shades for the crease and
for Roseberry I'm gonna pick up a new
brush so I mix up the color on another
brush so I'm gonna take the makeup Shack
t-64 brush looks like so and this one
I'm just gonna keep on the outer portion
of my eye I'm not gonna bring it all the
way and like I did the other ones
because this has more of a red in it so
if I bring it in too far it's gonna look
my eyes are a little irritated for the
lid I'm gonna take this shade these two
shades together and see if it's purple
enough for me let's just see okay this
is perfect I could already see it so I'm
gonna put that all over my lid but I'm
gonna try to keep it away from this
inner corner because I want to brighten
that up and I like to do that you can
actually take it all the way in but I
like to keep it away from the inner
corners just because my eyes are kind of
closed set and if I put a darker shade
here to make them look even more close
together I try to keep the dark eye
shadows towards the outside of my eyelid
so I'm just gonna go back with the t-64
brush from makeup shop and just soften
out the edges of the purples I have a
tip if you guys see a part of your
eyeshadow that is not wanting to blend
and it's just really harsh looking you
want to make sure that your hand is
right on the tip of the brush just so
that you have less control and it's
easier to move back and forth and with
the lightest hand just keep going back
and forth until you diffuse that edge
out I'm also gonna take it right on the
lower lash line too so I'm gonna come
around here and start to work that right
on the lower portion of my eye but not
taking it all the way in again you can
take it all the way in I'm just gonna
avoid that so I'm just gonna take some
of the canal shade from the NARS radiant
creamy concealer
pop it on my brow just to clean up that
shape and give it some definition for
this inner corner right here I'm gonna
take fresh from the viola Voss palette
just that color we set our eyes with I'm
gonna pop that on to the inner corners
to brighten it up or the crease I'm
gonna take berry black this matte black
shade right here and this is a time at
2:06 breast time Los Angeles to a six
brush and I'm just gonna work that into
the crease is to darken it up a little
bit more just to pinch more I'm also
going to take that black and work it on
the lower lash line as well to intensify
the lashes this is such a pretty power
this is the t67 from the makeup shop hit
my brush into rose berry which is this
shade right here I'm gonna pinch it with
my finger and just go right below
the black so I'm gonna do a black winged
liner with my hourglass waterproof
liquid liner I'm gonna see how I feel at
the end of the black liner I'm a pop on
a some pink glitter but we're just gonna
try out the black wing first so I'm
gonna go in with some glare over the top
of the wing so I'm gonna take my violet
Voss the secret weapon it's a glitter
adhesive so I'm just gonna take a little
bit on this brush and just go right over
the wing so once that's on there I'm
gonna take this violet Voss slitter in
Kiki you're right Kiki really pretty
purpley pink glitter I thought it would
be a really pretty contrast to the dark
smokey eye and I'm gonna go right over
the wing
okay because it is so intense sleeping
I'm gonna change it up a little bit and
add the black right back over it I'm
gonna put on some mascara and then pop
some lashes on it's from the war they
have different styles of eyelashes in
here but they all have a glittery black
band and if you guys can see it it's not
coming off on camera very well which is
really weird I just thought it would be
a perfect pair to this look that I'm
doing right here so I'm gonna do the
imagine lashes I'm gonna use this to
highlight my face later but I want to
use it on my eyes as well this is the
artist couture ex Jackie ina diamond
glow powder and the peach it is such a
beautiful freakin color I can use it
every single day I'm gonna take what I
have on the top and I'm gonna pop it on
to the brow bone and it's just gonna
make us look a little bit more extra a
little bit more glam you see I can't
begin to tell you guys how much I love
this diamond glow powder it is one of my
favorite it is so beautiful some and
take a little bit of the pink we used
earlier okay so the eyes are done I'm
gonna go ahead and move on to my
foundation the foundation I'm using
today is from G way it's the essential
high coverage cream in latte
okay to conceal my under eyes I'm going
to take the NARS custard medium one
Kuster that I used to prime my lids
earlier so I'm gonna use it right in the
hollow area like the ha lowest area of
my eye right in there I like this
concealer because it's super lightweight
it's medium to full coverage you can
build it up and it's just easy to work
with it looks really nice on your skin
it doesn't look super cakey or anything
it doesn't crease it's just such a
beautiful concealer also gonna use it to
brighten right where the mouth is right
here so giving myself a little bit of a
facelift before I highlight their color
range is so broad they just came out
with six new shades which is so cool and
then to highlight I'm gonna use Cannell
this shade right here and just so you
guys see what it looks like
so this one is custard and this one is
Cannell and that's gonna make the
highlighted points of my face look that
much brighter I'm gonna use one of the
newer shades to contour my face just so
you can see what it looks like up close
it's gonna be a very natural contour and
then just to set the contour in place
I'm gonna go ahead and use the pur
cosmetics contour diary okay so I'm
gonna take the shade passion right here
and work that right on the contour just
to set it and also deepen it just a bit
more
that soft contour they did with this
NARS concealer their new one it gave me
such a really pretty bronzy natural glow
that I'm just gonna stick with it I'm
not gonna add any bronzer I'm not gonna
add any blush I'm just gonna leave it
how it is
so the highlighter that I'm using today
is one that I have been loving so much
its new it's from artist couture X
Jackie I know it's the diamond glow
powder and lip peach so beautiful oh my
gosh I'm about to show you guys why
should you guys earlier on my brow bone
put on the face it's insane
I'm gonna take a little bit on my hand
just put some on my the tip of my nose
and then down the center of the nose and
to set my under eyes I'm going to take
charm and dream mix them together and
then just set right on top of the under
eye area okay it is time to make these
lips look extra clumpy so I'm going to
take this over lip liner and wine right
here to kind of over line and just
accentuate this shape
I'm gonna use the new Kylie Jenner
lipstick this is in the shade
angel cake I'm gonna go right in the
center with this because it's I know
it's super pale like a pale pink I'm
just gonna work it in with my finger
you know her lipsticks are really creamy
because this lipstick is so light I'm
going right back over the corner so we
don't lose the definition of the lip
shade thank you guys for watching I hope
