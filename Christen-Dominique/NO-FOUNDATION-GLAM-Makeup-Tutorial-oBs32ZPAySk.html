my new hair I cut it even shorter I
loved it so much I'm like before I
completely grow it out let me just cut
it one more good time like really short
the shortest I go today I am gonna be
showing you how to do this makeup look
using no foundation at all whatsoever
you know I'm all about the full coverage
I am a full coverage girl saw this video
floating around YouTube and I was like
wow I haven't done that one I was honest
a little skeptical but I still wanted to
try it even if it came out bad I love
the way it came out she like makes me
embrace my moles I have a lot of moles
on my face and I cover them up with my
full coverage foundations so it's like
it's showing my skin showing you know
the real me
I do have an annoying breakout on my
face and I covered it up completely and
I'm gonna show you how I did that
without using foundation so there's some
tips in here that you're gonna really
want to check out so keep watching and
if you want to see how I got this entire
look right here using absolutely a no
foundation at all then don't forget to
subscribe to my channel and hit that
notification about so you can be a part
of quad family and without further ado
let's get on with the things we're not
putting any foundation on our face today
we definitely want our skin to look its
best
so the first thing I'm going to use is
this facial lotion right here this is
from the IPPS Eaglin bag today's video
is gonna have some ATT glam bag stuff so
if you see these little guys right here
little sample sizes this is from the
Ipsy glam bag I'm partnered with it see
for this video just to let you know so
the first product I'm going to use is
this promised organic nourishing coconut
milk facial lotion with hibiscus that's
a lot that's a lot of words it's for
normal to combination skin perfect
because my skin is combination it's like
in the middle of dry a little tad bit
oily in some parts so I'm gonna go ahead
and take this and work it on the face so
we are going to put some in her hand
it's like a foundation color on this
it's made with coconut milk and I just
took a whiff of this and it smells like
something I would order and a lot going
to move on to the brows or the brows I'm
gonna take my goof proof brow pencil in
number 4
and just fill in my brows real quick
Brow's are good so now that the brows
are filled in I'm gonna set them in
place we're gonna itch on my nose so now
that our brows are filled in I'm gonna
go ahead and set them in place so I'm
gonna use this chela eyebrow a defining
gel it's a clear gel and I'm just gonna
go ahead and brush through my brows so
that they stay in place and I make sure
that the hairs are going up so that it
doesn't fall down since I'm doing no
foundation I have to really bring out
the eyes because of this pimple on my
face so what I'm gonna do is take this
concealer right here this is from Aurora
it's the pro cover-up concealer and it
is in the shade a balmy beige so I'm
gonna take that and work it on my lid
space
so now that I have my eyes primed I'm
gonna go ahead and add some eyeshadow to
my eyes and the eyeshadow that I'm gonna
use is this one right here this is
called the bomb voyage the bomb voyage
am I saying that right this is from the
balm cosmetics and it is a really pretty
shadow it's this one right here it's
from the bomb voyage volume 2 this is
such a beautiful brown with champagne
iridescent look to it it is so so pretty
what I'm gonna do with this is put it
all over my eyelid I'm not gonna do
anything crazy today it's gonna be
something that every single person on
this earth even your five-year-old
sister daughter can do so I'm gonna go
ahead and pop this on with an eyeshadow
brush this one right here is from the
time Los Angeles line her brushes are so
freakin cute this marble right here is
so so pretty it's the number 205 so I'm
gonna take that and I'm gonna pop it all
over the lid starting at the base of the
eye and then working my way up all the
way into that crease definitely don't to
walk around looking like that so I'm
gonna soften up the edges with a
blending brush this is one of my
favorite ones this is from dose of
colors it's just called blending and I'm
just gonna soften up that edge so for
the next color I'm gonna go into the
persona identity palette I'm gonna go
ahead and take fearless this deep dark
brown and I'm gonna line my lid right
here okay so next I'm going to coat my
lashes with some mascara and this
mascara is from eiko it's the black
magic mascara I'm gonna go ahead and
just do a few coats on my lashes I'm
gonna put on these beautiful lashes I am
obsessed with these lashes like no joke
this is what it looks like a close or
long they're flirty PC everything I want
in a lash this is the Natalie lash from
Amy June lashes they are so pretty so
now I'm gonna go ahead and work on my
face I'm gonna use the Aurora Pro
coverup concealer and balmy beige and
I'm gonna cover
my under-eye circles I'm still gonna
work on the lower lash line but I want
to kind of cover up this area before I
go any further with that so I'm just
gonna take it right on the inner corners
and I'm also gonna use this as a
highlight if you're not putting lashes
on you can definitely do this under ten
minutes it's so easy there's not very
many step now I'm gonna go ahead and use
some just around my mouth because it
does look a little dark around here so
I'm just gonna use it right there and
then some right on that zit right there
so we're just gonna put a little dot
there and the way that you work with
zits like this you don't want to focus
on patting right on the zit you want to
go right underneath it and then softly
just kind of go over the area with a
very light pressure okay so now that we
have the under eyes covered I'm gonna go
ahead and work on the lower lash line
I'm gonna take the same shadow that we
have on the top and layer it right on
the bottom but I'm gonna start off with
a base a little transition shade and
then I'm gonna go ahead and layer this
shade right here right on top of that
matte transition shade we use the next
shade I'm gonna use for defining the
lower lash line is this dark brown right
here and it focused that all around a
little lower lash lines so we're going
to go right under me and then I'm
blend it out I'm going to use this dose
of colors shader brush right here it's
kind of flat but it has a little bit of
a fluff to it so it's gonna help with
softening those edges out so for the
inner waterline I'm going to take this
nude liner from Tarte it's called fake
awake
it's a a highlighter so I'm gonna take
that and line up the waterline to make
it nice and bright and then I'm going to
take the mascara wheezed earlier on the
bottom lashes and for the contour man
use the k'kaw a medium powder kid I
loved it so much in my last video that I
was like okay
definitely gotta use this again I'm
gonna take a bronzer work that onto the
apples of my cheeks and up in the temple
to give me some color get some color
back in my face and then I'm gonna put
some on my nose just right on top
putting it on your nose kind of gives
you a natural sunkissed look I'm gonna
for the contour i'm going to take my
contour brush in the contour powder and
work that on the hollow of the cheek i'm
gonna put on a little bit of this Kat
Von D contour powder right here I'm
going to take this one right here a
little bit of this one in the middle
just go right underneath my eye
honestly this no foundation look makes
me feel like my skin is a little dry
because naturally it is
I think I'm not - spritz some kind of
Hydra mist and actually I am going to
add a little bit of liner right there
gonna add this Steve Lawrence precision
tip liner in black super super narrow
and the packaging is so luxe it's so
pretty
I just want it to look a little bit more
crisp for the highlight I'm using this
Catrice cosmetics highlighting powder
and this is in the shade champagne
campaign pop this on ooh this is so
pretty I love the quilting here looks
very fast like I'm gonna go ahead and
pop this on with a makeup shock t46
brush this is one of those soft natural
highlights which I don't mind because I
don't always have to have this intense
beaming highlight which I love but I
don't always have to have it like a nice
soft highlight is pretty actually this
it's really pretty right on my nose just
on the tip and because I feel a little
dry I'm also gonna put some right on my
chin so that is it for the face now I'm
gonna do the lips went a little bit more
color
because I feel like we're very neutral
on the face I'm going to go ahead and
take this Mac lipliner in mahogany
I actually just got this in this week
with a really cool package from M
cosmetics and they had a beautiful
bouquet of flowers like a vintage
looking purple and beige it was really
really pretty and actually have it by my
front door like a decoration when you
walk in you see it it's so pretty so I'm
gonna go ahead and top this off the lip
liner
and that is the final look this is very
pretty actually my skin I like the way
my skin looks
I really do that's so crazy I actually
didn't think I was gonna like this but I
do I'm very very happy with them just
going to spritz some of this LC hydrate
enhancer on my skin because I feel it's
a little dry so spritz a little bit of
that thank you guys for watching I hope
