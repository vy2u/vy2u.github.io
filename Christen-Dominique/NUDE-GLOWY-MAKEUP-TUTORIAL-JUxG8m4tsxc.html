getting real crazy
today we're going nude on our face hey
guys welcome back to my channel so today
I'm gonna be doing this super glowy all
nude makeup look using a ton of new
products that I got in my PR package and
I'm very excited about this product I
have a bunch of other new stuff but this
is like what I'm most excited about
right here I cannot wait to show you the
k'kaw contour powder kit and honestly
this kind of whole packaging inspired my
entire look today so thank you Kim
Kardashian I did a semi cut crease here
and I really just focused on a peachy
bronzy taupey brown nudes before we get
into the video don't forget to subscribe
to my channel and hit that notification
bell so you can be a part of the quad
family and without further ado let's get
on thing I'm gonna start with today are
my brows I'm actually gonna do them on
camera I'm gonna use the benefit goof
proof brow pencil and this is in shade
number 4 so I'm just gonna comb through
my brows really quick and I move my
brush back and forth like this I just
feel like this looks a little bit more
natural it's not like super perfect and
I use a very light hand and I'll just
build up the fullness and the areas that
I need to and then I'll just brush
upwards Laura Mercier just came out with
these little eye pencil or eye crayons
oh they're called caviar stick eye color
and they have this matte cream shadow
right here it's called vanilla kiss and
I'm gonna take this and use it as my
base for my eyes so I'm so excited when
I saw this I was like yes this is
exactly what I need for an eye look and
work that all over the lid it's
right honestly it is a little it's a
little too bright let's see how this
blends out and if not then re probably
are gonna have to use a concealer that's
similar to my natural shade cuz I'm just
gonna look kind of crazy never mind I
think we're gonna use this later though
because the look I'm going for today
definitely requires something like this
scratch that we're going to use the
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer I just
got these in I haven't used this
concealer in a long time this used to be
like a ride-or-die for me and then tart
shape tape came out came out and I've
been using that like it's a necessity
for my under eyes but I want it just go
back to naked skin and just check it out
see how it works because I kind of
forgot and since I have these huge long
Chloe's I'm gonna go ahead and use a
brush to pack this on with I'm ready to
get into the eyes I want to do something
that is a little bit more dramatic but
still have that nude kind of concept to
it so what I'm gonna use is this palette
right here from Marc Jacobs this is the
iconic palette so it has some nice nudes
topes and browns in it and I thought it
would be perfect for this look it came
in with like five or six other palettes
that were inspired by the Marc Jacobs
runway show so it's really really cool
it really intrigued me so I'm gonna go
ahead and use this guy right here and
then I'm also going to use a little bit
of this one work from Sigma the wild
flower palette I can basically only use
these shades right in here sorry it's
like not focusing because I want a
little bit more of a peachy tone I use
this to set the concealer I'm gonna be
using the Browns and the topes in the
Marc Jacobs palette I'm gonna go ahead
and take this shade right here which is
infamous and I'm gonna put that all over
my lid this is very very nude this shade
is like the color of my skin take that
with a flat brush and just wash it over
my entire lid so I'm gonna go in with
this brush I've been using this a lot
actually it's one of the Kylie Jenner
brushes from be birthday collection I
really like it so we're gonna work that
on the lid going up into the crease like
so and I like that it has a little bit
of it's not super flat so if you want to
blend something out you do have that
ability to do that and make it really
nice and soft so it works really well to
just apply the color and also to blend
love new lipsticks I love nude looks
nude everything nude heels then I'm
taking this brush from dose of colors
the blending brush and just going over
the edges really soft just to make sure
we don't have any harsh lines there
I like the rosy peach looking shade in
this palette so I'm going to take that
into the crease use that just on the
outer half of the eye it's just a little
light wash but I feel like all these
little colors add up to this beautiful
gradient so I always dip into so many
different shades the next color I'm
going to use is this one right here I'm
gonna take that and also place it in the
crease this is the shade seeking and you
want to keep these underneath the brow
bone I'm actually gonna bring this guy
and a little further I haven't used a
taupe crease in such a long time I'm so
used to warm tone shades that this is so
different I almost feel like it can look
a little dirty once the other colors
come into play it's gonna really make
the look pop I'm gonna take this Brown
right here and I'm gonna work that in
with a smaller brush this is M 507 from
more feet and just gonna take a little
bit of that shade and start at the
bottom circular motions and gradually
work that into this outer V making like
a C shape like that I'm actually gonna
bring this in a little closer to the eye
like right there just to give the eyes a
little bit of a different shape and with
the same amount of product that I have
on the brush and on my lid I'm gonna
start to work this a little bit higher
we have this going on right here so I'm
going to take that blending brush ozz
earlier and just soften this up so just
eases into the next color if you have to
can close your eyes so it makes your
eyelid space a little bit more taut and
then your brush can really glide on your
lid a little easier and then you open
your eyes and it's like surprise
hopefully a good job
so I'm gonna take this guy put it on the
back of my hand we're gonna go ahead and
use this concealer brush right here from
the makeup shock it's the t 86 and start
to clean up the brow okay so what I
decided to do is grab this hourglass
stick put a little bit on my hand and
mix it in with that vanilla kiss shade
because I'm the liking the color it's
giving me it has like a nice thick
opacity I'm gonna mix these two guys
together but use any concealer that you
have I just want to use something that's
a little bit more thick that's gonna
create the line easy so I'm going to put
my head back and follow the natural
curve of the eye
then I'm gonna go ahead and fill it in
with that concealer but I don't want to
work it in all the way I just want to do
it about half way and then once we get
to this point I'm gonna start to blend
it out with my finger so that it becomes
a gradient into the rest of the colors
and the warmth of your finger is really
gonna help with easing the color into
the skin and into the other shades I'm
gonna go ahead and apply a winged liner
I just got this in two from Tarte it's
their TARDIS - double take eyeliner and
it's super super super dark black
now I'm ready for the lashes the lashes
that I'm using today are from the Lily
lashes these are the NYC once looks like
so up close I will stick it on my eye
try not to drive your eye liner down and
change the shape of your eyeliner I
always end up doing that and just press
the ends of your lashes to the false
lashes so now I'm going to go ahead and
do the rest of my face and it is hot in
here first put down this primer this is
from Urban Decay
it's the complexion primers it's one of
those primers that's gonna fill in any
fine lines and texture and make it look
like a even plump smooth surface rub it
in my hands this is a new foundation
from Estee Lauder it's the double wear
nude water fresh makeup so I've tried
this out and it's a very light weight
it's completely different than the
double wear that I normally wear because
this is a lot lighter it's not heavy
it's not drying it gives you a nice even
coverage but it's not a full thick
coverage so I'm gonna pop this onto the
back of my hand oh oh my god okay I just
wasted all of that foundation the only
thing I don't like about these
foundation from Estee Lauder is that
they have these huge freaking gaps and
it's so annoying because I end up
obviously dropping it everywhere some
clumsy and it just gets everywhere it's
so messy that's such a good foundation
I'll be right back because you know
things are getting real crazy around
here I have a new fresh Beauty Blender
so I'm just gonna work this on my face
actually this is not bad it's like a
medium coverage it feels like nothing is
on my face which is good and then I'm
gonna go in with the Naked skin
concealer and hide those under eyes and
highlight with this too I forgot how
nice and smooth this glides on your skin
okay I'm loving this concealer again I
love how it blends out so easy and
brightens it's not heavy it's not thick
it doesn't crease I think I found my
love so the next new product that I got
in the mail
was this one right here I was so excited
to open this box
it's the k'kaw contour powder kits from
Kim kardashian-west
so I'm gonna go ahead and take medium
this one is this is what medium looks
like right here I love the sizes of the
pans they're pretty large and I like
that large and in charge I'm gonna go in
first with this bronzing shade right
here very creamy soft I'm gonna take
this color and bronze before I contour
up those on my cheeks and around the
temple I was honestly a little scared
that this was gonna be too orange but
actually like the way it looks it's not
too orange it looks crazy in the pan to
be honest on your face it looks really
good I'm loving the way the powder is
gliding on my skin it looks like it just
melts into your skin like it's it's so
beautiful I'm in shock because my first
saw these I was like I wasn't sure how
to feel about him because the head looks
like it has a little bit of shimmer in
it but you can't see the shimmer on your
face and then I'm gonna go in with a
contour color is this one right here I
like the fact that you can make it two
bronzy I feel like contour should
basically be the same color as the
natural shadow that your face cast you
see that natural shadow right there I'm
flipping the brush to the clean side and
working this up so now I'm gonna go
ahead and pop on a highlight let's see
which one do I mom I think I'm gonna go
with I'm gonna go with the brighter
highlight and you take that on the
cheekbones right there and then I'm
going to take the yellow shade of
highlight kind of it forms like a
gradient into the lighter shade I'm also
gonna take it on the inner corners of my
eyes so I'm going to take pearly shade
yeah loving that freaking palette so
good oh my gosh I didn't use the brush
okay I'll just blend it out with the
brush since I forgot to use the brush
the brush is cool though it has like a
dome-shaped side and a flat side use
this for the contour and this for the
highlight or for the the bronzer for the
lower lash line I'm gonna go back into
this shade right here and I'm gonna take
this brush which has the darkest shade
on it and it has very little since we
blended so much with it and I'm just
gonna work that on the edges of this
this mascara works great for the top and
bottom lash because of the formula not
being super heavy and wet it separates
lengthens it's just super black I love
it okay I'm gonna go with oats a very
natural brownie nude so I'm just gonna
line my lips real quick for the lipstick
I'm gonna go in with the Ardell lipstick
from that crazy I think are dull and
anything clashes but now they have a
cosmetic line which i think is pretty
cool and it's the Hydra lipstick that
I'm using
it's the shade nude you say thank you
