is summertime I cannot believe it's
already here is it summertime actually I
don't know but for me it's summertime
I'm gonna be showing you how to look
like a glazed doughnut in the summertime
you've been laying out for a while
you're a little bit your little burnt
it's just all natural your glowing orb
listening your bronze you see a glow
like that's serious glow I'm gonna show
you how I get this look but before we
get started I want to give a huge thank
you to Clinique for partnering up with
me in this video they have some balm
skincare products I'm about to tell you
what I've been using and loving to get
this extra glowy look if you want to see
how to get this look right here then
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
and hit that notification bell so you
can be a part of the quad family that's
us let's get into the video I'm gonna
get started with skincare I think it's
SuperDuper important to have a really
good skin care and especially a really
good moisturizer I have been using this
one right here from Clinique it's the
clinic smart broad-spectrum SPF 15
custom repair moisturizer I love it it
has SPF in it so I've been using this
guy I feel like the secret weapon to my
skin looking super radiant naturally and
just this texture on my skin is so much
better than what it used to be this is
from Clinique fresh press and daily
booster with pure vitamin C it has 10%
and in this vial right here has seven
days of product in air so it's fresh
it's at its optimal freshness it gives
you the maximum results so what I do to
use this it's helped retexturize my skin
just naturally blowing through my makeup
which is amazing and it comes with this
aluminum foil thing on top so what you
do is you peel it back and then it has
this thing right inside what you do is
press on it twice so you press one two
pumps and then once you press it you
shake it up so when you shake it up
you're mixing the vitamin C and the
product together I take the Clinique
moisturizer like so I just put it in my
hand
you got the cap I mix two drops into my
moisturizer you mix the moisturizer
together with a fresh Prostate booster
and then you start to work it into your
skin you are going to notice immediate
results and then within 4 to 12 weeks
we see a huge difference in your skin
this is summer right here this is summer
skin with no makeup my faves for the
summer so if you guys want to pick it up
you can go to your local Clinique booth
at Nordstrom and pick it up because it's
amazing alright so now that our skin is
looking really good its LOI I'm gonna
pick up this some NARS natural radiant
foundation right here I feel like this
is my personal favorite summer
foundation because it gives you that
skin like finish but it still has a ton
of coverage so I'm gonna show you guys
if you want coverage but you still want
to have natural looking skin dewy
luminosity glow eNOS this is the perfect
summer foundation okay so now that we
have an even base I'm gonna move on to
my brows so that I can put life in shape
back into my face take some brow powder
and just work it into my brows fill them
in naturally since we already have
foundation on our eyelids we are not
going to put concealer on so I'm just
going to Pat my Beauty Blender
over my foundation to make sure that
there isn't any creasing or anything
like that and then take a translucent
powder Pat it over my eyelid so we don't
have any creasing so now that our eyes
are set I'm gonna go ahead and jump into
the palette I'm gonna be using this one
right here from Patrick's stars
collection with Mac this is a summer
collection it's a super cute teal
packaging and this is the heat stroke
ice shadow
pretty neutral natural-looking colors so
what I'm gonna do is take this color
right here I think this is sandy crotch
I think that's the name of it and I'm
gonna put it all over my eyelid and so
for that I'm gonna be taking the makeup
Shakti 74 brush here that's like a
fatter looking brush it's fluffier so
we'll be able to apply more at one time
so I'm gonna cover the entire eyelid but
I'm not gonna go up to the brow bone I'm
gonna keep it underneath now I'm gonna
take this clean fluffy sort of clean
fluffy brush and just make sure the
edges are nice and soft and blended next
I'm going to dip into the darkest Brown
in the palette and work that on the
crease and the outer part of the lid I
don't want to bring it too far in
because it'll make the look a little bit
more dramatic and I want it to be like a
soft kind of glam summer look this is
the darkness I'm going to go right here
kind of doing these circular motions and
at the same time moving my hand back and
forth with the same two colors we used
at the beginning I'm dipping into both
of those and then working that on my
lower lash line but I'm not gonna take
it all the way in my eyes already kind
of close together so leaving it towards
the outer part of the eye like so then
I'm picking up this little fluffy guy
right here and I'm just softening the
edges of this and with this super
gorgeous color right here I'm gonna pop
it on into the inner corners of my eye
going down onto the lower tear duct
upper tier dug just make it really
really glowy and bronzy right there
because this is more of a natural kind
of toned down look I want to use this
face powder right here in light with a
flat brush and I'm just gonna go over my
brow bone and then with the darkest
Brown I'm gonna go in with a liner brush
I take the brown the dark brown and
start to create a wing on my eyelid I'm
not gonna go all the way in either I'm
just gonna leave it halfway it looks
like it's coming from the inside of your
eyeball to the outside now I'm gonna
curl my lashes so that can prepare them
and if you already have naturally long
lashes then just you can leave them the
way they are
you don't need lashes but if you are
lacking them or you just want to look a
little bit extra
that's me then you can continue with
lashes like I'm about to show you but
first what I like to do is put on some
mascara I found this one in my last
video I had never used it before us from
Charlotte Tilbury it's a really good
mascara but your bottom lashes too so
now we're gonna pop on some lashes to
really make this a glam kind of a look
so I'm taking these lashes right here
from house of lashes in the style siren
so when I'm done popping my lashes on I
always coat the tips of the real lashes
onto the false one so that it looks a
little more natural now that we're done
with the naturally glam summery bronzy
eye I'm gonna go on to contouring
snatching my face up so I'm gonna use
this mac quick trick stick snatch my
face up putting that in there trying to
hide my weird hairline
now we're gonna blend it all in
it's super light gives you that natural
skin kind of finish it almost gives you
an extra glossy kind of look so this is
perfect for summer as well because it's
not heavy just doing a little face
surgery actually have a video on face
surgery
aka contouring your face with makeup
I'll link that video below if you want
to check it out but I go through all the
contouring secrets so check it out it's
a very in-depth tutorial so now I'm
going to use this concealer right here
from Mac it's the water weight concealer
it's gonna give you that flawless skin
but I can't feel that I have a bunch of
makeup on kind of look I just put some
powder underneath my eyes because me
once you set everything in place we
don't want it to slide off over our face
so I'm just studying the under eye area
with this hourglass translucent powder
no surprise there love this powder I'm
just going in the center of the forehead
let it set for just two seconds and then
dust it off alright let's get into
bronzing the face making it look like we
have a tan going on so for that I'm
gonna take this brush right here and the
Mac Patrick Starr give me life bronzing
powder it looks like so I feel like this
is a universal bronzing powder instead
of using blush for this look I'm just
using bronzer that is kind of my go-to
summer look really nice bronzed skin
subtle neutral glam eyes and a nude lip
you're good to go with some highlight to
blind the haters I'm using this face
brush just to make sure I don't have any
harsh lines on my bronzer so now I'm
gonna use the highlight it's called a
hot and heavy look at that hmm
our little highlight brush is my
favorite highlight brush by the way it's
from morphe it's the m5 ten start to
work that on the cheekbone a little here
where the light would just naturally hit
your face Cupid's bow I don't know if
light hits it there but I like the way
it looks when it's what's there I'm
gonna do the chin - some people have
oily chins oily faces if you feel
to care about your oils around your chin
you don't have to put it there just skip
that step I'm gonna take my finger to
apply the highlight down the bridge of
the nose and right on the tip of the
nose so we are going to look like we got
some Sun I'm gonna go over the top of
that highlight with this right here I
love love this this is from Venus
organics it's called the diamond glow
skin illuminator and wedding ring it's
really just to give you that glossy look
and amplify it's a highlight a bit more
so I'm gonna press that into my skin
these do not judge me for my nails I
know I need to go get them done so bad
just at that time
well my upper lip to look like it's been
sweating a little bit that was the end
of the tutorial bye just kidding we
forgot the lips so let's get back in
here alright so for the lips I want them
to look naturally full natural so I'm
gonna take this you weigh a long wear
cream lip liner it's like a brown and
the shade fawn I kind of overlined my
lips a little bit and then I'm gonna
take the user fashion punch which is a
nude peach or cream pie this is like a
pinky nude so mmm I usually like to go
with nudey pink so I'm gonna go with
this one just because I'm gonna keep
that same family going and now we are
done with the tutorial
thank you guys for watching I hope you
enjoyed this video and I hope that you

before I let you go I do want to let you
know that things that you tell yourself
impact everything that's happening
around you so if you are constantly
telling yourself negative things
negative things will start to happen in
your life be careful how you talk to
yourself make sure that you are being as
positive as possible to yourself and
nothing but good can come from that I
love you guys so much and I like to help
you in any way that I can I want to be
here for you so that is it I love you
