happening right now and that's pretty
much it if you want to learn how to get
this glowy makeup look then keep
watching so I am trying a bunch of new
stuff today and really excited I went
shopping online and I just kind of went
crazy
the first thing I picked up I've been
hearing so many things about it it's so
many great things it's this guy right
here this is the Estee Lauder Double
Wear full-coverage foundation you know
I'm all about my full coverage
foundation so when I heard this was the
one to use to look super flawless I had
to get it I got the shade 3w one and
I'm just gonna put some on my fancy hand
right here um then I'm going to grab my
baby bun and you know put it on my face
to make little dots I have high hopes
for this foundation I really hope I like
it I wanted to make my skin look even
and just like a blurred effect in real
life so let's see if it does that I want
to know what kind of skin types I have
watching because I really like full
coverage foundations I want to know like
what do you look for in a foundation do
you look for sheer coverage or just want
it your skin to shine through and just
add a little bit of a healthy glow to it
like what kind of skin type do you have
because mine's is is pretty textured it
has a lot of texture I have some
blemishes
there's discoloration and so I always go
for those full coverage foundations but
I don't want my my foundation to feel
really heavy and cakey and I found some
foundations and that are great with
coverage but it just feels like you're
wearing so much cake on your face so
this is cool because I've never done
this before I usually try out all my
makeup before I put it on camera so this
is so different for me I like the color
if you like just blends in so nice - my
natural skin if you guys have trouble
figuring out your shade and foundation
all you have to do is take some
foundation dot it on your neck and then
rub it in see if that matches if it
doesn't match don't buy it that is a
really easy way to gauge what color your
gonna be so the coverage seems to be
really really nice it's definitely
covering up those blemishes and red
marks evened out my hyper pigmentation
and it's doing pretty good it doesn't
feel too heavy on my skin but it doesn't
feel super lightweight either right in
the middle I'm definitely loving the
coverage go in like this like if you
have a Beauty Blender don't like smear
it around because you're not getting the
most coverage if you want the most
coverage and the most bang out of your
foundation you always want to press into
your skin the feel is a B - the coverage
is an A
kind of feeling a little tight right now
hmm either way I like it okay so now I'm
going to move on to the concealer the
mac prolongwear concealer this is nc15 I
should have gotten a different shade
maybe nc' 20 so I am going to go ahead
and put some on my hand and we're going
to cover our under-eye circles with this
I forgot to tell you guys I also bought
these cover FX custom infusion drops
this is the hydration drop and you can
put this in anything that goes on your
face you could put in your skin care SPF
foundation I haven't tried them this is
my first time and I totally forgot to
use them on my face and I think it would
have worked really nicely but I already
put on my foundation because my
foundation is feeling a little tight
right now but I'm just going to put it
on my hand anyway I'm going to put it
into my concealer guys could see it has
like these little flakes in it like so
and see how that works
smells really really good does it it
does I feel like it's not giving me the
most coverage I feel like it's taking
away from it a little bit so I'm going
to add a little bit more without the
drop in it but definitely I would have
used these in the foundation if I
haven't already put it on my face and if
you do get something that's super light
like this that you're not comfortable
with using on your face or under your
eyes he's it as a highlight those areas
are supposed to be a little bit
abnormally light anyway so you take it
and use it to your advantage that's what
I'm going to do just bought a new dip
brow in ash brown from Australia I just
bought a new brush this is the number 7
of mini duo eyebrow brush here we go I'm
excited about this because the tip on
this brush is so fine oh I just
accidentally stuck my finger in my nail
deep inside of here so unfortunately it
looks like so I'm going to take my brush
you see how fine this is can you guys
tell
hedaan like disappears I'm gonna put
some music on because I don't think that
you guys really need to listen to me
talk about my brow
just wanted to add that this foundation
works great for the lid because you can
see that it's not creasing my whole lid
is nice and even and it hasn't create so
this is good if you don't have a primer
for your eyes this foundation works
really good too but it's kind of a
pricey primer for your part for your
eyes so I would just use it if you
happen to have it I also got this Stila
palette this is the eyes are the window
shadow palette and this is the palette
insole and there's a lot of taupe
neutral shades in here that I really
like so I'm gonna go ahead and use this
let's take this shade right here this is
being like i'ma being Yura being and I'm
gonna go ahead and take my fluffy brush
and just start to work that all over my
eyelid I'm gonna take this morphe M b23
and work it into the shadow then there
goes my face you see me work this on my
lid and work it up into my brow bone
just put it all over the lid or get in
there putting on one eye shadow all over
your lid is also going to help with all
the other shadows to look more vibrant
it's going to lay on a lot smoother I'm
going to go ahead and take that shade
all the way into my inner corners and
I'm doing this because my inner corners
are super hollow so I just want to
brighten it up when you brighten up this
area it's kind of like popping it out so
it doesn't look so you know deep I'm
just gonna do that right in there now
I'm going to go ahead and take let's see
what shade for the crease I'm going to
take this shade right here which is
individual here load up my brush and
work it into the crease I'm just going
to place it on my lid and just start to
work the color upwards and the crease
you don't want it to touch the lid
and then once you have this shade soften
up the edge just wiggle my brush back
and forth to soften up to the edge so
it's not so harsh like that and then
once you have the shape that you want
then you're going to take a fluffy brush
so I'm going to take this 224 this Mac
224 and
I'm just going to in windshield wiper
motions buff out the edge you want it to
look natural I'm going to go ahead and
go into the brow bone and just brighten
it up a bit with that same shade right
here I also picked up this really
beautiful shade right here this is from
Dior this is the Dior show fusion mono
this is instantly going to give your
eyes a super summer look that glowy look
I glow up as much as I can during the
summer because that's what you're
supposed to do so I'm just taking it
with my finger and I'm gonna pop it all
over my lid instantly you have summer
glowing eyes that's all I'm going to do
for the eyes then I'm going to use this
mascara right here this is from Marc
Jacobs this is the velvet noir mascara
I love the bristles on this brush I feel
like it's like super fluffy and the
bristles are very soft all usually when
they're tiny they're like really hard
and sharp and you feel like you're just
cutting your eyeball or this one is very
soft and fluffy in there little short
bristles so they get every little lash
so I really like this one like so the
next thing I picked up was this NARS
bronzer in Laguna and it I haven't tried
it before I'm going to take my brush
right here this is a Smith 118 brush and
I'm just going to work it onto the
cheekbones like this just to add some
color and warmth to my face bring that
tan in summer is all about the glow in
the bronze so I'm just gonna pack on the
bronzer and the glow and it's so quick
it's just swiping it on your cheeks and
I'm gonna take it down my nose a little
bit right here
so I'm going to be using a highlight
this is a new highlight from Tarte this
is the exposed highlight and it looks
like so just going to put it on my
finger a little bit on my nose
it's a very nice natural looking a
highlight and I'm also going to put it
right here my Cupid's bow and then I'm
going to take a highlighting brush to
swipe it on to the tops of my cheekbones
so I'm going to take my zoeva fan brush
load it up and swipe it on if your face
is a little more matte naturally matte
like mine I like to put a little bit of
the highlight on my chin if your face is
oily you probably want to stay away from
that area but for me it kind of like
gives my face a little bit more of a
glow that it's not used to so I put it
right where the light would basically
hit on my face that's pretty much it for
that I'm gonna go ahead and curl my
lashes using this Tarte eyelash curler
that has a ton of mascara on it so I'm
just going to wipe it off real quick get
them all in there everybody fits I like
to pump my lashes like this and then
hold it for like 20 seconds just pump it
as I leave the lash so I went a little
crazy on the lippies I bought a few of
them I bought this YSL lip liner this is
in shade 17 just a nice pinky rose color
orangey coral and this is a pink shade
this is number 7 and this one is number
15 I also got two of these Dior lip
glosses one of them is a pink one my mom
had this one right here and I loved it
so I picked it up this one right here
this is really I just like honestly I
like the way the packaging looked it
looks like a lipstick right it's so cool
and then but wait it's not so this is
like a vibrant orange e coral so I
really really wanted to try it so if
you're going for something in the summer
I automatically think orange e corals so
I'm going to take my lip liner this is a
nude lip liner so it's going to work
fine because it's just gonna make our
lips look a little bit more full
naturally that's pretty much the same
shade as my natural lip color and then
I'm going to go ahead and take this
orange coral and fit right on top and
it's actually very sheer it kind of
smoothes tangerine II you know can do
any who's that a little words very sheer
and then I'm going to go on top of it
with Dior Addict milky tint and number
376 I'm gonna lay it right on top thank
