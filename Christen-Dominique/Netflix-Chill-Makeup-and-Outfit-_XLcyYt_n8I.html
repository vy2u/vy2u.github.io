channel so today I wanted to bring you
something that is very near and dear to
my heart
Netflix and chilling I love to Netflix
and chill and Mother's Day is coming up
don't take me to a fancy restaurant like
I just want to be on the couch order
some pizza order a coke and chill just
watch things look cute snapchat be with
fam you know just relax that would make
me feel amazing and even if you're not a
mom your friends coming over your
boyfriend your husband whatever you
still want to look a little cute you
don't wanna look like you just rolled
out of bed and then to the couch you
know you want to look like you tried for
the day and then sat on the couch so I'm
gonna show you how I got this look right
here it's a very neutral eye I added a
lash but I mean obviously you don't have
to go that extra extreme and out of lash
I think the lashes adds a little
something something that was missing and
the eye is super natural very neutral
and the brows are just like my basic
filled in brows like peachy blush nude
lips very neutral and pretty so I'm
gonna give you this look right here and
also gonna show you what my favorite
outfit is to wear my favorite kind about
fix I don't wear this every time I'm
sitting on the couch but I do wear stuff
that is very similar to this and it's
super cute and I'm about to show you my
outfit in just a little bit first I
wanted to show you how to get this
makeup tutorial right here so if you
want to see how I got it and see how
this outfit looks my favourite Netflix
and chill outfit then don't forget to
subscribe to my channel and hit that
notification bow so you could be a part
of the quad family and without further
ado we're gonna get on into this Netflix
and chill day I just cut my face I'm
gonna go straight into a skin tint that
I'm gonna use from NARS it's this Velvet
Matte skin tint right here and I'm just
going to work that in this is the Alaska
light to color and I'm just gonna take
my Beauty Blender work that in there if
this was just a regular kind of just
watching TV maybe you have nobody coming
over then I would have like no makeup on
at all and honestly if friends are over
I probably still have no makeup on but
this is a glam version of a Netflix and
chill kind of day we just want our skin
to look
then you don't want it to look perfect
perfect but if you can why not
even though you're like not going
anywhere and with this skin tint you
only need just a little bit and it
covers so much but even though I still
put on the whole bottle I mean that's
just that's just what I do make sure you
bring it down into your neck so you
don't have a like well I have alligator
skin right now I'm half tan half not
half almost
tan coming off but not really because
I've been through some crazy strange
skin things these date these past few
weeks and I'll tell you about them later
but yeah that's my tans coming off so
that's what it looks like that but
either way I want my skin to still look
some kind of good then what I'm gonna do
is put on some concealer you needs this
one from k'kaw this is the shade number
four
I'm usually shade five but I feel like
shade for just gives me that extra boost
this usually knows about these other
places but it's just enough licks and
chill so it's not that serious
okay so I'm gonna do my brows usually
nobody's looking at your brows while
you're sitting on the couch watching TV
but if you are on snapchat those filters
do not help your brows so you might as
well fill them in while you're here so
I'm gonna take my brow powder right here
and just fill them in really quick
nothing fancy just making them super
even and natural-looking sort of
all right so now I'm gonna get into my
eyes and I thought this palate would be
perfect for this look because first of
all it's Kylie's mom
Kylie's mom's face and this is the
momager palette and on the top it says I
have one word for tonight vodka so I
thought this would be perfect because
look at the palace the color scheme here
it's super neutral so many pretty
shimmer shades to choose from I'm going
to show you close-up what they look like
so the first color I'm gonna go in with
is it's an emergency which is this great
OB shade right here and I'm just gonna
work that all over my eye lid I'm gonna
take this fluffy brush right here from
the makeup shot to t68 I'm putting this
all over my crease and my lid working it
washing it in like so it's a really nice
cool tone shadow just washing it in like
so you pick up this color right here
right there that Mommy shade and work
that right on top but I'm gonna take a
different shape brush as the morphe m4a3
3 brush picking up that shade and just
go ahead and right over the outer edges
and then she has a lot of different
shimmery shades in here so I want to
choose something that is pretty and fun
like they're all pretty but I think I
would choose maybe like this one's
different and cool as like a little blue
in it and then what this one is kind of
different
it's like cranberry this impressed vodka
tonic
it's actually something I'd drink if I
drink I always get vodka tonic I'm gonna
mix gorgeous and vodka tonic together
and I'm gonna work out on my inner part
of the lid and on the brow bone right
here I'm gonna take I love myself which
is this bone color I'm gonna push the
color down into these other ones so that
it all transitions smoothly into one
another wow that's actually pretty
bright I didn't realize how it's a very
neutral very basic you probably won't
even be able to tell that you have eye
shadow on all right I'm gonna take the
Mac 266 s brush right here and I'm gonna
pop it in - does it come in black and
I'm just gonna line the outer part of my
lash line right here just to have some
kind of flicked going on
and this black is very soft it's almost
like a gray so that's pretty much all
we're gonna do it's so simple I'm just
gonna hit around my lower lash line so I
don't look naked like this I feel naked
when I don't have a shadow on my lower
lashline I don't know why I'm weird but
I feel naked so I'm gonna take paybacks
of B and I'm gonna work that on my lower
lash line like so I'm washing it in
there so working it back and forth no
fancy techniques here just rubbing in
our eyeshadow you know what I'm gonna
take 10% 10% this gray color I'm gonna
work that on my lower lash line it's the
same brush that I used earlier just a
little bit just because I feel like we
need a little something gonna give us
just a subtle hint of a little something
I'm just gonna work my brush back and
forth on the lower part of the lash line
just so that it fades together with that
transition I put underneath it I don't
want it to look harsh like I don't want
a harsh line I just want it to look like
a soft subtle definition there so done
with the eyes very neutral spot the most
neutral eyeshadow looks I've ever done
this palette is extremely neutral kind
of want to add something on my inner
corners just for fun I like this shade
is really cool it's called haters it's
like a looks like a baby blue just
reminds me like a icy baby blue kind of
color so I'm gonna take a little bit of
that and just pop that on my inner
corners for fun ooh am I better hurry up
because jersey shore is about to come oh
no you guys watch that show but I have
been pretty addicted to that show and
then I'm gonna press into it so it just
looks a little softer there's no harsh
edges you can actually use your fingers
for your entire eye you would have a
really pretty smudged out soft focus
look if you just use your fingers so
that's it for the eyes I'm just gonna
add some mascara and I know you're gonna
think I'm crazy but I'm gonna add some
lashes
for the sake of a look honestly if I was
just chilling at home by myself I would
have no makeup at all all right I would
not put lashes on but for the sake of
this look going up on YouTube some knees
my the most natural looking lashes that
I have these are
lilly lashes a style Lux looks like so
very natural so I'm going to take those
and just we're gonna pop them on for fun
actually let me get some mascara on
before I pop these on just gonna use
this push mascara from milk makeup okay
we are done with the eyes officially
they are so natural I can't even begin
to explain now we are gonna move on to
the rest of the face I'm gonna find some
more concealer I feel like I have no
concealer on for some reason so I'm just
gonna put a little bit more on really
fast right in there and to set my under
eyes I'm gonna take the hourglass powder
I used it in one of my last videos and
it just like I fell in love with it I'm
gonna set my under eyes really quick it
looks a little bit more bright
underneath the eyes and it just make
sure that there's no creasing and all
the other things like who cares we're
gonna be chilling on the couch but
doesn't matter
we still don't want a crease okay after
this we are going to go into the rest of
our face I'm gonna keep it pretty basic
to be honest so I'm gonna take this Marc
Jacobs coconut this actually just came
in today this coconut bronzer you guys
know I used the black one all the time
so when this one white one came in I was
just like let's try it out so I'm gonna
take that and bronze up my face I just
want to add some warmth into my skin you
know take some of this guy work it in
pretend like I have somewhat of a tan
going on the cool thing about this is
that you know snapchat filters can fix
that you're good there our face is warm
for the face I'm gonna go into the
you're doing amazing sweetie a face
palette I'm gonna take the your sister's
going to jail blush this peach blush
right here oh my god wow I'm actually
have a video coming up on what the
situation is so don't be alarmed I'll
explain in the next video or in the
video coming up soon so yeah so I'm
gonna go ahead and put this matte blush
on and then for the highlight unfit on
its snowing pussywillows
so this one right here BAM look at that
highlight
I'm gonna go ahead and use this give me
a kiss lipliner that's such a mom thing
give me a kiss
I say give me a hug I think I said you
me a kiss but I'm gonna put this liner
on right here so for the lips I'm gonna
use the give me a kiss lipstick I love
the packaging it's so cute I'm gonna go
ahead and put that on my lips and then
over that just because this is in her
collection she has tons of glosses I'm
gonna use driving me crazy
another mom thing and I'm just gonna
work that in the center of the lips she
has a lot of glosses that I really like
but I can't use them all in one videos
so and they're really cute all right so
this is the finished look right here
very cool tone very natural like I feel
like if you're taking a picture it would
only look like you have lashes and lips
on though I don't think anybody's gonna
be able to tell that you have anything
else on your face this is very very very
natural all right so that was my makeup
look this is going to be my favorite
go-to kind of outfit when I'm on the
couch just hanging out I love sweaters I
love cozy things cute socks like that is
just me like I'm gonna be 60 years old

chill for life one of my favorite kind
of chill outfits to wear is something

shoulders it's so cute and it has like a
lace-up in the center and they're just
basic jogging pants and they also have a
cute little lace up on it my socks are
