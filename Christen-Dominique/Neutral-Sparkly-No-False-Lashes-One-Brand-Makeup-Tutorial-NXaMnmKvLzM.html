today I'll be showing you how to get
this super glam holiday makeup looks
perfect for those holiday parties that
are coming up especially New Year's with
a glitter you have to have glitter in
your New Year's looks so if you want to
learn how to get it then keep watching
so I'm going to start with my foundation
I'm going to use this one here from
Revlon and I'm going to take my
foundation brush just work it into my
skin I'm so excited for the holidays I
love Christmas is probably my favorite
time of the year is like giving presents
and being with fam this brush makes it
super easy to blend in your foundation
really fast
I feel like this foundation has good
enough coverage that I can use it as a
concealer itself I'm going to skip on
the concealer today I just use a
foundation so now I'm going to fill in
my brows I'm going to use the Revlon
Colorstay brow pencil in soft brown
first imma comb through my brow I'm
going to use the more narrow side of the
pencil to fill in the brow hairs in the
front you can turn it on its side and
just create those hair like strokes and
then once we get to the the mid tail end
of the brow I'm going to use the flat
side I'm just going to fill in my brows
right there they're pretty sparse and I
feel like as you go through your brow
with this pencil it tames your hair and
kind of lays them down flat and then
with the spoolie side you could just
brush through so if you brush upwards
you can see they like they stay up so it
gives you that feathery look this brow
pencil is long lasting so it's going to
last you throughout the night in your
browser in a stay put all day for the
eyes I'm going to take this Revlon
Colorstay cream eyeshadow in 7:20 and
I'm going to take the little brush that
comes with it it's right here
just pull it out and I'm going to pick
up some of the product with it and this
is going to be the base to our eyeshadow
so I'm going to go ahead and pack it
onto the lid this is going to act as a
really nice base because any eyeshadow
that goes on top is going to have a
really nice warm look to it
so just going to apply this to the other
lid I'm gonna take another color stay
cream eyeshadow this is in the shade
creme brulee and I'm going to pop that
onto the center of the lid these are the
kind of eye shadows that are going to
last you throughout the night they do
not budge once you put them on they will
not budge unless you wash it off later
that night and the gold shade on top
makes the look more of a holiday makeup
look I think it's so pretty if to blend
out the edges you just use your finger
and it just blends in really smooth so
now I'm going to create a wing so I'm
going to use the Revlon Colorstay two
and one angled Kajal and this is an onyx
and I'm going to use the angled tip to
create a nice sharp wing if you want to
smoke it out it has a little smudger
brush at the end in case you want to
smudge it and smoke it out I'm going to
keep it pretty clean for this look so
I'm working this into the waterline and
this is going to help redefine the eye
and it's waterproof too so next I'm
going to take a gold glitter and I'm
going to pop it on to the inner corners
and now I'm going to apply a few coats
of mascara so for the blush I'm going to
use the Revlon insta blush and very kiss
and I'm going to swipe it on my cheeks
and this blush is good for when you're
on the go and you just need a quick
flush of color you just put it on there
and blend it with your finger to set
everything on my skin I'm just gonna
apply some base powder this also helps
if you're a little bit oily helps
mattify your your face so now that our
face is done I'm going to go ahead and
move on to the lips I'm going to use
this abroad Blanc Colorstay lip liner
and this is in the shade chocolate and
I'm going to align my lips
and then for the lips I'm going to take
this Revlon Ultra HD gel lip color in HD
arabica and I'm just going to apply it
to my lips I like these warm colors for
the holiday season they feel like
they're so warm and cozy and this brings
good vibes it's a gel but it's still
very pigmented and it's hydrating it's
moisturizing and I feel like I could
wear it all day and not even feel like I
have it on thank you guys for watching I
