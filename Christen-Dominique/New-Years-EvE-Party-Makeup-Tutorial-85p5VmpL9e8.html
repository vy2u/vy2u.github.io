friend this is my last video of the year
and we want to look gorgeous in her
final hours 2012 so let's get glittery
pack on our false lashes and extra glam
aside let's begin we want our makeup to
look beautiful all through the night so
we're going to start off with mallies
liquid face defender now we want to
cover up those dark circles and
blemishes I do this before my
long-lasting airbrush makeup application
I don't know about you guys that I can
be that last-minute kind of person who
has no time to get ready so I'm going to
use an airbrush foundation so let me
skin looks flawless and no tiny fly
alright so now I'm going to use my
favorite highlighter ever it's from
luminous air and I use it to highlight
under my eyes on top of my cheekbones it
brightens up my face so I really like it
and next I'm going to take some tape
like this and apply it to the ends of my
eyes next step is super important you
want to pack on some translucent powder
because I'm going to be applying this
black shadow that has tons of fallout so
I'm going to put it on top of my lids
and so that the powder catches it and I
could just wipe it off when I'm done as
you can tell I extended it out just a
bit to make it look a little winged and
a little more dramatic and then I'm
going to go in with Mac's wedge and
blend out the crease so that looks
nicely blended like this and then I'm
going to take a soft matte highlight to
my problem and then immediately start to
put a gloss over my black eyeliner so
that my glitter can stick and takes a
minute but it will definitely pack on to
be opaque and you want it to look a cake
with the black around to take off the
tape you notice this really nice
dramatic edge which I love and I'm going
to take that grayish color I took from
the might that makeup palette and just
run it along the lower lash line and
then put some black pencil liner and
then go in with a glitter liner
and just line the inner corners and half
at the bottom I go in with a black
eyeliner and line the top it's a lot a
lash line and then I'm going to go back
in with the black and just deepen the
crease for a more dramatic effect and
kind of keep that on the crease and
actually I'm bringing it in just a
little bit take a fluffy clean brush and
blend out the edges now I'm going to
take this dark gray color and put it
right in the center of the crease for a
nice gradient effect taking my Mally
volumizing mascara along with some
lashes I'm gonna take Max Atlantic blue
and just run it along the lower lash
line now I'm just going to go back in
with the white and go over the Bravo I'm
going to use this really cool double
ended retractable concealer brush from
it cosmetics to touch up the areas where
the tape is placed I'm just going to
take some concealer and blend it in
around the eyes as you can see I really
love this powder since I've already hit
pan on it and I'm going to cover up and
brighten the under eye area I love this
mineral powder because as a yellow
undertone in its full coverage alright
if time is skinny fie your face
so I'm going to do this by bronzing up
the cheekbone temples under the chin and
the jawbone area this is really going to
help you look super gorgeous in your
pictures alright we're gonna add a
really pretty glow to our face by using
mikeís hush blush and then I'm going to
apply this naked truth from my day
makeup to add some dimension to my lips
I'm going to be using Mac's salmon gloss
alright so now we're adding height to
our hair I'm going to be using this
expanded dust powder that just makes
your hair look so full and beautiful so
now we're glammed up and sexy
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
