hi everyone welcome back to my channel
so today I'm going to be doing this New
Year's Eve makeup look I cannot believe
the years almost over it went by so fast
makeup look for you guys I hope you
enjoy it and let's get on with the
tutorial I'm going to use this Marc
Jacobs primer first it's the coconut
primer it helps with hydrating my skin
lately my skin has been super dry
especially because of this weather so
I'm gonna apply this one and then I'm
gonna go over it with the Tarte primer
the smoothing one because it really
fills in those large pores that I have
in certain areas and also some blemishes
it just makes your skin look very even
and soft so I really like this and it
also you're gonna be out really late so
you want your makeup to last as long as
you can because I want my face to look
super flawless all night I'm going to be
using a super full coverage foundation I
didn't know is going to be this thick
but that's okay because you know it's
kind of last long this is the Marc
Jacobs
foundation it is a little bit too dark
for my natural skin tone but my body is
actually darker than my face right now
because I'm fake baked and I don't like
using fake tan on my face here I'm just
filling in my brows going a little bit
thicker than what I usually do it it's
just because lately I guess I've been
very impatient with my brows and I've
been getting smaller and smaller every
time so maybe I should go and get them
professionally done at some point in my
life
to do this I use the Anastacio dip brown
- brown and a little powder to go over
the more sparse areas now for the eye
shadow I'm using these two shades here
from Kat Von D interstellar palette and
I'm using these two purpley satin taupe
shades right here and I'm going to wash
them into the crease it's not going to
be a big drastic change we just want to
add a subtle dimension to your reefs so
that your transition looks really nice
and blended and then I'm going to take
this grey shade right here if you have a
matte shade that works perfect because I
didn't have one in the satin one kind of
worked for me but I would have used
matte if I had that and then I'm using
this a neutral satin shade right here
from the vice 4 palette and I'm going to
apply that all over my lid so I'm going
to take this matte black shade right
here and I'm going to carve out my outer
crease if you don't have a outer crease
if you don't feel like you have much of
a crease this is the time where you can
actually create your own and then with a
clean brush I'm blending it outwards and
upwards towards the brow bone just
because I'm trying to be extra careful
black can get really really messy so I'm
going to use a clean separate brush for
that I'm going to go back and forth
between the two brushes to build the
intensity to make sure the edges are
nice and soft I'm going to take a fluffy
brush just to blend out the edges and
then I'm going to take that black shaves
earlier and I'm going to line my
waterline or my lash line and then blend
the edge of that out as well just kind
of like what we did with the crease and
then I'm taking a black pencil this
one's Urban Decay 0 and I'm going to
line my waterline
now I'm going to create my wing so to do
that I'm using the makeup forever ink
liner I'm going to flick it outwards
bring it inwards and then slowly bring
it in towards the inner corners and to
make sure that our wing is extra extra
sharp sharp as a knife I'm going to take
a concealer brush that's very stiff and
small so you can get right in there it's
very precise and just clean up the edges
doing the same thing with the other eye
and now for the fun part I'm going to
take this glitter adhesive the glitter
and the glitter adhesive are from violet
vos and this is in Nye so I'm going to
go ahead and apply it right on top of
the adhesive and it's going to be a
little messy at first because it's going
to go it's not going to be exactly where
you want it a little bit of flexing to
go above and below it so I'm taking a
pencil brush and I'm cleaning it up then
I'm going back in with the black just to
make sure that it doesn't get on the
black liner I'm also going to do the
inner corners so I'm doing the adhesive
first and then I'm going to use the
glitter right in the inner corners you
want to make sure that you're using in a
cosmetic grape glitter because real
glitter that is not made for your eyes
can get really now I'm just going to
coat my lashes with some mascara and get
them ready for some balm policies these
falsies are amazing I've been using them
every day in my snapchat get ready with
me that's all you see I took them to
Houston I'm here right now and this is
all I'm using these are vamp Tris from
violet ball so I have a tip for you guys
I always used to have lopsided lashes
and it was so annoying but I figured out
a way to make them go on to the center
so what I do is take my tweezers and
grab the lash right and center pop it on
to the center of the lash line and then
attach one side at a time
Here I am applying a little bit of
mascara to the tips of the real lashes
and then I mesh the real embossed lash
together with the tweezers or sometimes
I use my finger and now I'm just going
to highlight my face like the PI points
of my face and right underneath my under
eyes because it tends to get darker
around this area even though I put
foundation so I'm going to go right
underneath my eyes my at the top of my
nose Center my brow and my chin here I'm
just blending it out with my Beauty
Blender
and I'm going to do a little bit of
baking just so that my contour my
cheekbones were can look extra divine
and to do that I take my transition
powder and I apply it right underneath
the contour so it looks extra defined
and then this is the smashbox contour
palette and i'm taking those two darker
shades and running it alongside the nose
and at the tip just so that it looks
more structured taking off a little bit
of that baking powder and then I realize
hold on I haven't put on any powder so I
dip my powder brush into the Kat Von D
powder which by the way makes your skin
look extra super flawless and smooth and
then I went back into that contour shade
in contoured my cheekbones and temples
also right around the hairline so
everything looks more defined and a
little more structure so now I'm just
going to contour along the jawline and
underneath the chin your jawline has a
natural shadow just follow that shadow
and deepen it up as much as you need to
I'm doing right along the the jawline
and underneath the chin area and I feel
like my double chin has been growing and
growing and that's just because of my
eating habits doing this really helps
out and it makes your face like it drops
you down a couple of pounds I'm just
saying I feel like it definitely works
and then when I'm highlighting I like to
use the manic Adar powder that I just
showed you guys but I also dip my brush
into the banana powder from honest Asya
and that also helps with brightening the
under eyes so I do this to the under
eyes and right around the mouth because
it tends to get darker in this area and
then I just go on the top of the bridge
of the nose or the blush today I'm going
to be using the Tarte Amazonian clay
fearless blush it's like a pinky coral
shade and I'm going to apply it with a
stippling brush because I like how the
bristles are not as close together so it
like lightly evenly applies the blush
without it being like super intense so
then I'm going to take my charlotte
tilbury highlighter I'm just going to do
the tops of my cheekbones the tip of the
nose and right on the Cupid's bow for
the lips I'm going to use this mob shade
this is the Tarte ista lip liner in
later Graham and I'm going to kind of
over line my lips a little bit just so
they look a little bit more fuller and
plumper and then I mean using nameste
which is a really pretty nude shade and
the liquid lipstick is super velvety and
smooth
I love the way it feels and this is
basically the entire look I hope you
