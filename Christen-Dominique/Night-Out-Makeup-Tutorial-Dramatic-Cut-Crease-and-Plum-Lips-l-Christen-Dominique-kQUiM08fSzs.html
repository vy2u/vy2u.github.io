hi everyone welcome back to my channel
so today I'm going to do this I look
that you can basically wear with any lip
color today I chose to use this plum e
purple color and for the wing I added a
maroon purplish maroon color on the wing
and you can basically switch this around
you can do a blue wing or a green one
anyone you didn't you any kind you want
I hope you get some type of inspiration
from this look or you can replicate it
don't forget if you do this look tag me
on instagram and hashtag christian
dominique so i can check you out if you
want to learn how to get this look then
keep watching you're gonna start out
with first is my prime time from
bareMinerals in medium i'm going back to
this oldie but goodie actually I don't
have any more so I'm just gonna do this
this stuff is really good so I'm just
going to apply this to my entire face so
that I can fill in my fine lines and
pores and also evens out my complexion a
little bit so I use less foundation when
I use this
feel like it can't go any further
without putting some type of primer on
my face and especially this one's my
number one primer which I am currently
running really low on so that should
tell you guys a lot okay now I'm ready
for foundation going to use my Smashbox
to do skin and I'm just going to even
out my complexion with this and add more
coverage so I stopped eating wolf just
this week I am trying the Paleo diet and
I stopped eating bread and dairy for
this week it's only been a few days but
I already feel like there's a big change
in my skin so I don't know if I may be
allergic to it or what but I feel like
it's less there's less breakouts really
loving my skin right now
to cover my under-eye circles I'm going
to use the benefit erase paste and this
is in number one affair pick it up later
it's really thick
so next I'm going to pick up defi and
wing out the top lashline
if you love your wings like I do then
you're really gonna like this idea so
what I did was grab a burgundy eyeshadow
and I layered it on top of the wing to
add a subtle pop of color
sadly the more vibrant color wings just
don't suit my eyes I've tried it and it
just did not work out for me but I can
still feel fun and brings a little bit
of a more interesting look to my eyes
that now they have this pop of color
next I'm picking up the colour-pop cream
pigment and I'm just going to run this
right along the edge of my wing and very
close to my lashline to give my lashes
some fullness and just add more
definition to my eyes
next in picking up the hello flawless
powder in medium and I'm going to use it
as a shadow I'm going to apply it
directly to my lid try to avoid your
crease this is going to make your crease
really pop and make everything really
look really nice and clean next I'm
going to be using my bronzer to create
some depth along my crease and I'm just
going to sweep this right along the
crease avoiding the lid space so it can
look really nice and defined next I'm
going to take revolver which is a soft
black shadow and I'm going to focus this
on the outer part of the crease and once
I have the shadow where I want it then
I'm going to flick it out towards the
brow bone with the clean side of my
shadow brush now I'm going to take a
smaller dense brush and I'm going to
trace just above the upper wing so that
it follows that flick
using the same color I'm going to run
that just along the lower lash line next
I'm going to take the hello flawless
powder in champagne and I'm going to
focus this right along the arch and then
lightly feather it outwards
to add some light to the eyes I'm going
to pick up truth which is a pale pink
shimmer and just gonna pop it on to the
inner corners and it's going to make our
eyes look brighter and more awake now
I'm going to apply my smashbox by
brightening mascara to the top and
bottom lashes so now i'm going to apply
my false lashes today i'm going to be
using the violet Voss mesmerize lashes
i'm trying to look for a name and i
don't see one so they just look like
this
you
just applied my lashes and just to mesh
the real lot with the false lash I'm
going to apply some mascara to the
bottom or the tips of them then you can
still kind of see the glue so I'm going
to go back over with the shadow
me as the hello flawless from benefit
and I'm going to say the word beige
right today and this is in the color
beige
to set my under eyes I like to use a
lighter powder and I'm using the hello
flawless in champagne to brighten and
add some more coverage
so next I'm going to contour I'm going
to do that off-camera and then I'll come
back and do my lips for you guys guess
what I got my Park Avenue princess from
Tarte it's new hopefully let's see if
it's not cracked this time it's not I
love this highlight it's literally the
best highlight I've ever tried so this
is what I'm going to use today and I'm
just going to use a blush I'm going to
mix the blush with a bronzer create my
own blush color
now for my favorite part I'm going to
highlight my cheekbones using the
champagne color from this Tarte palette
so next I'm going to use the revlon
colorburst matte balm in shameless
I like the color of the lip balm it's
just very sheer so what I'm going to do
is apply this NYX soft matte lip cream
in Copenhagen right over it
so this look I'm going to use see hello
pop I'm going to use the hello flawless
so now I'm going to put so this is
pretty sure so what I'm going to do stay
so like five more times so this so the
the lip on looks a bit easier I always
use a weasel and this is the final look
