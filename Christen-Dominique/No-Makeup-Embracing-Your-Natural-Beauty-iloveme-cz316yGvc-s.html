sometimes it's good to just reflect on
yourself and acknowledge who you are
what you love and why you love it
lately making my bed in the morning
makes me happy I don't know why it just
makes me feel like everything is put
together as I'm getting ready I'm
putting my hair in a ponytail because
it's quick it's cute and it's easy and I
honestly I just feel more free
I feel free to do more things hey
sometimes I'll do a Monday bun day so I
can hashtag it but you know what today
is not that day today I'm going to
embrace Who I am and I'm actually not
going to wear makeup today I'm going to
embrace my natural beauty I'm going to
focus more on me from the inside today
today's video is going to have nothing
to do with makeup I'm going to walk
around the entire date without it and
honestly this is something that I would
never be able to do a few years back so
one thing that I think is super
important for everyone is to have time
some quality time with yourself and let
go let go of everything or worries
frustrations anxieties fears and to do
that I usually use this app you don't
have to use an app but I use this one
because you could just enter the way
you're feeling and then it generates the
best meditation for you or you can just
use your breath and just focus on it and
literally think of nothing but your
breath and that helps to think clearly
and focus on what's most important in
your day before I discovered meditation
I realize now how cluttered my thoughts
were before how I let my emotions make
my decisions for me and now I'm able to
understand them rather than act on my
emotions so after I'm done with this
then I'll go ahead and get dressed
a typical outfit for me would be a cute
comfy sweater and some leggings
something super cozy super comfy long
boots are perfect if I could wear them
all the time I would but you know it is
pretty hot here where I live so - the
boots
something else I like to do is just
drive drive with no sound and just enjoy
the peace coffee in the morning makes me
super happy I don't know why but I look
forward to it every morning and I think
it's not so much the coffee itself but
the experience it brings and all the
experiences I've had with it it just
takes me back to like having coffee with
my mom and chatting it's just really
kind of nostalgic for me
one thing I enjoy seeing is someone
putting themselves out there and doing
what they love and usually when you do
this you inspire so many other people to
follow their own dreams and I think it's
so important for us to support one
another in these ventures that were
going on because your support and
encouragement could be helping someone
with a huge dream that could possibly
impact the world and inspire others to
do great things
if you were to have known me before I
wouldn't be able to do what I'm doing
right now smiling at random people
saying hi if anything I would avoid it
just because I was so insecure with who
I was but now I make it a point to do it
as much as possible
I definitely have to say the best parts
of my life are the times when I'm able
to teach enjoy the accomplishments of my
family play like a five-year-old again
because in my heart I'm still just a big
kid and love without any restrictions so
this is me and now I encourage you to
create your own hashtag I love me video
showing what you're all about and what
you love or post a picture of yourself
on Instagram with out any makeup on in a
public place and hashtag I love me tag
me in it so I can see I love all of you
guys I hope you enjoyed this video and
until the next video bye dollies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
