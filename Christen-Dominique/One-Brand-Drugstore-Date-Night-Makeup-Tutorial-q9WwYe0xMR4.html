today I am filming this date night
makeup tutorial me and Ceaser haven't
been on a date in so long so I was like
okay we got to make this happen I pulled
out a red lipstick if I'm getting on red
lipstick it's a special night makeup
tutorial is giving me so many romantic
vibes it's kind of making me a little
uncomfortable I've put on this red
lipstick I feel like red is of such a
romantic color it's bold I feel like it
gives me confidence and I just feel so
good when I wear a red lipstick like
this and I am using this Revlon Super
Lustrous a love is on red lipstick you
guys that was very dramatic this
lipstick smells so good I just want to
eat it but I know I can't because that
would not be good it smells like
strawberry skittles taste the rainbow it
smells really good and it says I attract
love in six different languages on the
tube
that's my eyeliner from earlier you want
to learn how to get it then keep
watching I don't know why I snapped I'm
going to even out my skin tone and stir
too or get into my skin always make sure
to bring it down to my neck so
everything looks even I remember the
days when I wouldn't bring my foundation
down to my neck and I thought it looked
cute like I just walked around like that
like I had like a different head
attached took a different body terrible
I like to keep it light around the eyes
because I'm going to go back in with
concealer I'm going to conceal my under
eyes
pick two make sure to get around the
mouth because for most women it's
usually pretty dark around the mouth
area so I like to brighten it up a
little bit and then the inner corners of
the eyes where it's really hollow so I'm
just gonna fill in my brows it's filling
in the sparse areas and going in the
same direction as your brow just filling
them in and I'm going to brush through
them I like the way this holds your brow
in place so it doesn't move around too
much if you brush it upwards it's going
to stay up okay so now I'm going to go
into the eye shadow I'm going to take
this shade right here and just work it
into the lid actually apply it all over
the lid just so that we can have an even
base to work from and I'm going to take
this taupe shade right here and work
that into my crease just to create some
depth there I'm doing a soft neutral eye
shadow look because I want the focus to
be the lips we're basically going to
highlight the natural contours of your
eye now I'm going to take a darker shade
of brown which isn't this one right here
I want to create the illusion that my
eyes a little bit more elongated than
what it actually is so I'm going to
bring that darker shade further out
towards the tail of the brow bone I'm
also going to start to work that down
towards the outer part of the lower lash
line I'm connecting these two guys
together and just flicking it upwards
and I'm leaving the inner part open so
it gives you more of like a sultry eye
shape and I'm going to bring this shade
right here right into the inner corners
to brighten up the inner part of the eye
also going to bring it down on the lower
part as well this is going to make your
eyes look more open and awake now I'm
going to take this pinky shade and
highlight my brow bone with it
now I'm going to create a small wing on
my top lashline
Vaman applies generous amounts of
mascara cuz we want our lashes to look
super flirty and add a flush of color
I'm going to take this stick blush right
here and I'm going to apply it to the
cheekbone so I'm going to set everything
in place put a little bit of powder on
this is so that your makeup will last
longer throughout the day always want to
set your foundation and concealers
anything creamy you want to set it I
take bronze Beauty it's this powder
blush and just gonna add some warmth to
my face so I'm going to go around the
cheekbone temple a little bit on the
forehead for the lips I'm going to take
this Revlon Colorstay lipliner in red
and I'm going to outline my lips just to
give them more shape and make them look
a little bit bigger the lipstick I'm
going to be using this Revlon Super
Lustrous love is on red lipstick and it
feels very creamy on the lips it just
glides on so smooth like butter it is
really creamy I could do that all day
this is a really pretty red color I feel
like it looks it would look good on
