my channel so today I'm doing a full
face of only using Bobbi Brown cosmetics
and this is the first impressions for me
because I don't really have much of
Bobby Brown and this is the first time
because I'm really using a lot of it and
it's so funny that it's the first time
because Bobby Brown was the first makeup
artist book that I bought as a teenager
and I learned so much from it how to
cover temple concealing Foundation
braces like all kinds of stuff so it's
really cool that they actually reached
out to me to do a video with them and so
I'm really excited to test things out
and what I'm really really excited about
is this concealer because they're saying
it's supposed to be like magic maximum
coverage concealer and you guys know I
love full coverage concealers so
especially anything that's gonna cover
these under-eye circles I want to test
this out and see how it works for us and
if you want to learn how to get this
look right here don't forget to
subscribe to my channel hit that
notification bell so you can be a part
of the quad family and without further
ado let's get on I'm gonna start off by
getting this skin together real quick so
I'm just gonna put a light layer of
foundation so I'm gonna use the skin and
net foundation SPF 15 from Bobbi Brown
and this is in the shade 4.25 tan I have
so many breakouts right now please don't
judge my skin this is a very light
formula just bounce that on really quick
wow this is a very lightweight
foundation I'm gonna need a little bit
more coverage so I'm gonna have to go in
with another layer see how than it is
like water almost this one is gonna be
one of those buildable foundations
everything looks nice and even so I'm
gonna just do my brows so this is the
long wear brow gel right here and this
is in the shade rich Brown looks like
that
and I'm gonna go in with my little brush
and just fill in my brows supernatural
oh my god this is the cutest little
mirror
you see yourself I feel like that's
gonna be a little too read kind of like
keeping the brows in place at the same
time filling them in this is nice I just
wish I had a little bit more coverage
for the brows and I'm gonna go over with
powder moving on to the under eyes I'm
about to do some work some magic on my
under eyes right now we're gonna make
them disappear hopefully so what I'm
gonna do is take the micro-mini be
blender and I just wet it without
wetting it once you wet it gets twice
the size gets pretty big and I like this
for concealing and for contouring or
highlighting if you want to use creams
this one fits right in that area so
perfectly so I'm gonna go ahead and take
this little guy to apply the concealer
after I squeeze it squeeze all the water
out of it I then Pat it dry with either
a little towel or a paper towel then I
use it on my face just to make sure
there isn't any excess moisture or
wetness in there so I'm gonna go ahead
and use the instant full cover concealer
from Bobbi Brown know how I am with my
concealers so let's try this guy out and
see how it works on our face okay so I
have a few shades with me they actually
have like 15 different shade ranges I'm
gonna go ahead and try this one in the
middle right here this is beige this is
supposed to be maximum coverage so I'm
going to start by applying it right in
the inner corners this is my darkest
area so I'm going to focus it right here
dot it right down here and right up here
I'm also gonna do is to I'm highlighting
with it so I'm gonna go down the nose
like that right in between the brows get
that Cupid's bow right on the chin okay
so now I'm just gonna work it in with
the micro-mini
I'm gonna use the smaller side for write
on the inner corners I'm just gonna dab
it in this concealer feels super
lightweight on the skin having a more
full coverage concealer it makes the
face less cakey and it really just
focuses on where you need it adding that
in there
fits right in those inner corners so
perfectly and then I'm gonna go right in
here okay
yes this concealer literally is so good
and it's super lightweight but you can
tell the coverage is it's an intense
coverage whoa this concealers really
nice under eyes are concealed
life is good I'm gonna go in with this
eye shadow right here in shell Pat
everything in place okay the first
transition color I'm going to use is
this one in toast so I'm gonna take this
color right here and I'm gonna work that
all over the lid all the way up into a
little bit past the crease this is a
really pretty color especially for like
a transition shade okay and then from
toast I'm gonna go in with camel and I'm
gonna work that from the lid up into the
crease so I'm just using patting motions
because I want to focus the color on the
lid but we do want to take it up into
the crease a little bit and now I'm
gonna go in with the darkest round that
I have which is black plum which to me
looks like Brown is this shade right
here so I'm gonna go right on the lid
and just pack it on and if you want some
guidance to see where your socket is if
you just tilt your head back a little
bit you can kind of see where that bone
sticks out if you still feel like you
can't see it you can always just make
your own little socket all right so I'm
gonna move down to the lower part of my
lash line just because it's very I got
really heavy really quick up here so I
just want to make sure that it's
balanced on the bottom of my lash line
so I'm just gonna take some of the Brown
and work it right underneath there so
I'm gonna take this black shade right
here I'm gonna go and line the waterline
and
on the tight line as well the next thing
I'm going to go in with is eyeliner it's
this sparkling golden bronze color it's
so pretty but I'm just worried that it
won't show up on my actual eyelid but
we're gonna try it out anyways I put on
some mascara and lashes off-camera and
then I will be back and we're gonna do
the rest of our face so now I'm gonna go
ahead and set the outer perimeters of my
face I set my under eyes already so I'm
going to take this bronzing powder in
natural one so I'm gonna grab this with
my fan brush and just go right on the
cheekbones and right on the temples I
feel like I haven't been highlighting as
much on my channel I'm just going
through like a different kind of phase
with my skin but I found this
highlighting powder it's called bronzed
glow look how beautiful it is what the
Sun start right here on the Cupid's bow
right on the nose and then right here
last but not least are the lips so I'm
gonna take this nude lip pencil line up
my lips and this is their lip pencil and
nude I'm gonna take this lip color right
here in neutral rows and go over with a
little bit of gloss this is in nude 8
I've been loving glossy lips lately so
I'm just gonna layer a whole bunch of
that stuff on fried chicken with
