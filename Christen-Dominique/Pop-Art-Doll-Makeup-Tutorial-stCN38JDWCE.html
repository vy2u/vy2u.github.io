ourselves into a pop or doll so what I'm
going to do is start off with a very
light Foundation which is the for me
that's going to be my Kat Von D locket
tattoo foundation I like this for two
reasons for one because it's extreme
full coverage and for this look you kind
of want to have that flawless face like
literally cartoon flawless so this is
going to give me that vibe and then it's
just the brightest foundation I have
also I'm going to use it on my brows
because I need to have no brows at all
for this look I want to have these small
babydoll eyebrows so I'm going to go
ahead and take my makeup forever palette
taking this black color right here this
is the flash palette and I'm going to
start to create those very thin round
babydoll brows and then I'm going to go
ahead and actually picked up a little
bit of brown and you can't really see on
camera but when I get to the second eye
you can tell that there is a little bit
of brown in there you can make it all
black or you can add a little bit more
color than what I did
customize it how you want it make it how
you like it exactly then I'm taking this
hot pink shade from the Urban Decay
palette I'm gonna place it all over the
lid
and then I'm gonna go back in with the
black shade from the flash palette and
then I'm gonna go ahead and draw my
crease so what I'm going to do is draw a
crease above my natural crease just so
that it's very smooth and you can see it
really really clearly because my face
has a lot of fold in it so it would
probably be really messy if I did it on
my natural crease and then I went ahead
it went all the way in to the inner part
of the nose now I'm gonna go ahead and
trace the nose in different cards I know
this will be kind of a weird when I was
doing I was like this looks so weird but
at the end it all makes sense and it
looks really good
I'm going to go ahead and trace little
parts of my nose around the nostril
and the cool thing about this is that if
you mess up you can have a makeup wipe
and just wipe it off I took a little
concealer brush and I would brush on a
makeup wipe and just clean up those
lines to make a more clean and kind of
sharp where I needed them so you'll see
sometimes it looks messy and then it
looks clean is cuz I cleaned it up a
little bit and then I just patched a
little bit of foundation with my
foundation brush and I was ready to draw
over it again so here I'm just going
around the nostrils and then Ceaser just
totally walks in the shot I'm he came to
visit with me and kind of film where
where I was filming out of scene so then
I did the cheekbones went around the jaw
line this is just drawing out your face
like you're a comic book character so
you just keep doing that and you can
also go around your forehead which is
what I did and then later I realized
that I could could have totally skipped
this step because I have a wig that's
covering it um but if you were gonna do
this I'd leave it thin like this because
you'll see on the next shot after this
eyeliner that I'm about to use it looks
really thick and drawn in I would not do
that if I were to go back I would have
been if you made that line a lot thinner
um but here I'm just drawing out my lash
line in my lashes you can make them a
little bit thicker if you like I just
wanted them to be more st. in flirty so
here I'm just drawing three lashes here
I'm making the first lash the longest
lash and then the meet the second one is
the medium one and then the last one is
a shortest
so here I'm creating little freckles on
the cheeks just to give the look more of
a dolly feel next I'm going in with this
pink eyeliner I'm going to place it
right on the waterline and kind of over
exaggerate that waterline making it a
little bit bigger so our eyes look
bigger and Dobby eyed and then I'm going
to take a angled brush without black
color from the flash palette and just
redefine the lower lash line and kind of
only bring it in halfway and then draw
out the false lashes at the bottom I
think this makes the look extra flirty
cheesy dolly and then I'm taking these
lashes right here from California
cosmetics they're very like spread apart
kind of spiky which is perfect for a
doll look and it's kind of over
exaggerated which is exactly what you
want and then I just put some mascara on
there mesh them together and kind of
push them up with my finger and now I'm
taking this lip liner from colour-pop
and I'm going to line my lip line I try
doing the black first I practice this
look like five times and it was so messy
so if you're not a pro at drawing or
just used to drawing I would definitely
go this route first I'm using the lip
liner to create the lip shape that I
want and then going in with a lipstick
this one is candy yum-yum format and I'm
gonna fill in the color so it's nice and
vibrant and then I'm going in with the
black to line the lip on the outer and
inner part of the the lips and you want
to look like a comic book drawing like
if you're drawing it and then coloring
it in I don't know if I said that
already today but every time I look at
it I'm like okay I'm drawing then
coloring in it okay like in color unit
so I'm going to line the bottom and then
I'm going to go ahead and line the inner
part of the lip too and I'm going to
create these little lines in the center
of the lips that's going to make our
lips with more pouty and cartoony you're
going to notice that the the edges of my
lips change to more pointy instead of
rounded that's because I change them and
camera just an FYI I wasn't happy with a
rounded lip on me but if you want to go
with it you can totally go with it for
the highlight I'm using this white right
here and I'm going to take it and put a
little bit on the corner of the lip and
then I was like dang this looks really
harsh weird so what I did is I took a
clean brush right here this one and I
just faded out the edges to make it look
more you know seamless and I love the
way look afterwards I was like okay this
looks good so after that I went ahead
and draw drew in my chin and then I
decided to draw a little mark right here
on my brow just to make it look more
like I have a facial expression going on
so then I went ahead and drew in more
lines on my body to make it look like I
had a neck and collarbone so yeah simple
as that
um I had a tube top on okay so this gets
pretty low because I do a little bit of
drawing on my chest but I have a tube
top on I promise you guys I am not naked
so here I'm drawing out the word dolly
I'm using those bubble letters to do it
kind of like you can use pal or boom or
anything like that but I just decided to
do dolly I was actually gonna do Kiki
but I decided that that was a lot of
words to draw and this was not easy
because I was drawing it backwards and I
didn't realize it and yes I did I did
you just hear me ask ask yeah poor deaf
who sells us um he was like that's
totally backward so I had to erase it
and then I did it the right way so you
guys can read dolly and then I did a
heart right here you can do anything
one if you know how to draw a bow if I
knew how to draw a bow I would have
totally drawn a bow but I didn't know
how to do that
so if you know how to do it definitely
draw a bow a heart make it really cute
then color it in I'm using the Urban
Decay shadows to kind of color it in and
they're super intense and I think that's
what really made this really pop
honestly guys I wish I would have drawn
out my shoulders and arms I feel like
that would have made the look even more
cartoonish even so I think the look is
super fun and cute I bought most of the
makeup I use today on an online store
called Ebates
I wanted to mention it to you guys
because you actually get money back from
shopping there and the cool thing is is
they had all the stores that I use like
Sephora Ulta target was just one of my
favorites and then it's totally free to
sign up and if you spend over $25 on
your first purchase they're gonna give
you a $10 gift card to Target Macy's
wal-mart Kohl's or you need or you can
do like a $5 he needs cash back so I'm
gonna thank my mom for telling me about
this because she's been doing some early
Christmas shopping I just wanna say
thank you mom cuz I thought I got some
cash back thanks cuz I buy a lot of
makeup and I kind of go crazy on it but
anyways that's pretty much it I love you

lot of fun doing it and if you like this
