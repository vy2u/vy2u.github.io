change I am now the buna emoji or she
liked this I dyed my hair I feel like
it's such a good change for the winner
and my heart's need a break but I'm very
happy with it at first I was a little
scared but I adjusted Jaden has told me
he doesn't like it it's okay I think he
needs to get adjusted to I actually
really like it now cuz I was used to
like the dimension and it just it was so
different but now I really like it I'm
just going back to my roots let me know
in the comments what you guys think
about my original hair color that I was
born with taking it back with my nails
they're super glittery love it my nails
were so ratchet for so long very happy
about these nails right here so today
I'm going to show you how to do this
quick and easy holiday look literally
super quick because I actually have to
go to the airport in a few minutes so I
haven't even packed so I have 5 or 10
minutes to pack so I'm gonna try to do
this as fast as I can you like this look
I promise you it probably looks a little
complicated but it's super easy and I
hope you guys enjoy this holiday look
and it's got further ado let's get
started
before we get started and jump into the
makeup I just want to let you guys know
I'll be using some products from the
estate C glam bag in the first product
that I'm using is this Ren clear skin
glycol lactic radiance renewal mask this
guy right here I'm gonna put it on right
now just a little mask before we get
started this smells really good like a
mango or something or tangerine
tangerine mango this mask is supposed to
renew the skins texture and tone so I'm
gonna put it on let it sit there and it
also minimizes pores and
hyperpigmentation so I need all that
stuff to work on my face today I'm gonna
go wash that off now I'm going to use
this tarte maracuja oil on my face today
it's gonna help with moisturizing my
skin it also helps with firming the skin
and I actually really like using this
for my split ends a flyaways when I have
flyaways the next thing I'm going to use
is for my large pores I got some big one
my nose I'm going to use this
Porefessional from benefit Lucas ochio
as a little baby and I'm going to take
some of that and the way I like using
the professional is by tapping it into
my skin like this I like to use it
around my t-zone because my pores are
out - say hello to everybody and I'm
trying to push them back into their
house feel like it works best this way
it really gets into the pores and fills
them in so it looks really nice and even
when I'm going through a quick look and
I want to just get out the door quick
and easy I'll use a foundation stick
today I'm going to be using my hourglass
it hourglass vanish stick in nude and
i'ma just use that on my face really
quick and just glide Ounces smooths with
that Monica gel wheel like butter like
vada ooh that's a lot of foundation I
love it though so now we're going to
blend it in with my beauty sponge from
Tarte and just press it into my skin get
in those inner corners it is very hollow
in there very hollow sleepy hollow
actually Pat it dab it press it work it
into your skin you just want to make
sure everything matches and then don't
forget your neck actually I'm really in
a hurry I have to catch a flight to
Houston so this is a really quick makeup
look now that everything is even I'm
going to start to working on my eyes I'm
going to be using the Urban Decay Naked
ultimate basics palette and I'm going to
take rush right here this is the morphe
Y 18 brush I'm loving the gold brushes
by the way you guys I have a discount
code if you just type in my code right
here you'll get a discount on these
brushes and everything on the morphe
site so I'm going to take the pre-game
shade right here to matte yellow color
very pretty like a banana color and I'm
going to take it and go all over the the
lid all the way up to the problem this
is going to be a nice base well I want
this matte color to be laid down first
because this is going
even out your entire lid and also set
that cream that we just put on our lid
so that anything that we put on top is
just going to blend a lot easier and
look a lot smoother the next thing I'm
going to do is put on the lid color and
take below this shade right here it's
like a white shimmery shade and I'm
going to press that into the lid when
you're on the go and you need something
quick the easiest thing to do is enhance
your eyes with contour colors in this
case it has a little bit of a shimmer to
it which makes it a little festive in
pretty and then with a clean brushing
brush or with the brush we just used to
lay down that all-over shadow we're just
going to soften up the edges before the
crease color I'm going to use this
morphe m4 12 brush and then take
commando right here and I'm going to
work that into the crease and what we're
doing is just and if you're in a hurry
you can't find this palette or a color
like it just use just use your contour
palette if you have a contour palette or
even a bronzer would work anything
that's going to enhance that crease it's
going to create a natural shadow if you
want to get a little bit more depth take
a denser tinier brush so what I'm going
to do is take my morphe y22 brush and
I'm going to use this shade right here
it's called lethal we fill us a little
bit of a darker Brown I'm going to take
lethal and instinct actually mix them
together I'm going to work that my on
the crease just blend out that second
crease color so it's nice and soft
looking and smooth so it looks like that
gives it a little bit more depth is your
eye a little bit more dimension you
really don't need to go any further from
there and then for the brow bone I'm
just going to take I'm going to take
nude this shade right here and we're
just going to pop it on the brow bone
I'm going to take this Pat McGrath
silver pigment and I'm going to work it
on to the lids my city color brush right
here and this is like a baked eyeshadow
it's really pretty I'm just going to pop
it on
lid you can wet it if you want no get up
really good pay off that way but I think
I just want a subtle shimmer now I'm
gonna use an a-level move I'm gonna use
an eyeliner I'm going to take my hardest
liner and just make a wing with the
other side the pencil I'm going to go
ahead and fill in the upper part of the
water line right on the tight line that
number I can never get used to that I'm
going to go ahead and put on some
mascara and lashes and I will be right
back for the lashes and I take these new
House of lashes lashes lashes lashes so
I'm going to take these House of lashes
in the style Mon chéri it's a new lash
style and I'm going to go ahead and pop
them onto my eye and then for the bottom
lash line I'm going to take a tempted
and place that underneath my lash line I
mean underneath my waterline we're a pop
of color I'm going to take this NYX
professional makeup prismatic shadow and
this is in the shade fireball it's a
really pretty metallic shade i swatched
it it's a really smooth shadow and it's
super pigmented look at that crazy color
I'm going to pop that in to the lower
part of the lash line I'm going to take
this royal and langnickel Moda angle eye
shader brush and I'm going to work that
NYX shadow in with that angle brush
eyeshadow brush is 100% vegan friendly
so that's cool stuff now I'm going to
take some silver glitter is that Urban
Decay had metal glam rock I think it is
got glam rock silver glitter I'm going
to pop that onto the inner corners of my
eyes
then I'm going to go in with this mica
beauty angled eyeshadow brush and this
is really good for contouring for using
contouring colors around the eyes so I'm
going to go ahead and go back into
commando and tempted and I'm just going
to work that right underneath the next
shadow now I'm going to put some
concealer on just to brighten my
under-eye circles
yeah and also use it to highlight my
face and then blend it in with my Tarte
Beauty sponge feels like jelly on my
face it's so soft it's softer than the
actual Beauty Blender and it works a
little bit better in my opinion which is
a big thing to say because the Beauty
Blender is like the best thing and then
to lock it all in place I'm going to use
this hello flawless benefit powder and
never settle petal and they take my NARS
is my nurse
I think he's japonesque the japonesque
work it into my face just set everything
in place
I just rhymed and way to cool I mean who
rhymes out of nowhere me I do and then
for the blush I'm going to take this
City color cosmetics be matte blush I'm
going to take this shade right here
which is fresh melon I'm going to pop
that onto my cheeks with this japonesque
brush and it's a really nice matte
natural flush of color I'm gonna bring
it up around the temples kind of do a
little bit of the draping technique to
add a glow to my face without using
bronzer and then for the lips I'm going
to take this matte lipstick from
absolute New York and this is in the
shade Bulgarian rose very pretty red
it's supposed to be a vibrant matte
lipstick so let's try it out and see
what we think here
