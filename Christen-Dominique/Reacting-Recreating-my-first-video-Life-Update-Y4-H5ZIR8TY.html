today I am gonna be recreating and
reacting to the first video I have ever
put on YouTube
I had to mentally prepare myself for
this because it's super super cringy for
me and I'm cringing right now and hasn't
even started yet you guys are gonna see
why because I'm also gonna be recreating
this look but I'm gonna use the products
I'd use now like nowadays because I have
the products you'll see what I'm talking
about
also we just got foundation on my shirt
so if you notice this spot over here and
a little bit in my hair literally this
just happened before I turn on the
camera so you know what's going on also
gonna give you some life updates of
what's going on in my life right now I
don't think I've ever done a video like
that before just kind of sharing what's
going on in my life and I've never done
something like that before so that's
something that will be also talking
about in this video but before we get
into the video don't forget to subscribe
to my channel if you haven't already and
hit that notification bell so you could
be a part of the quad family and without
further ado let's get on with the video
here we go I'm gonna go to oldest
because I've had I've made so many so
many so many videos so I'm gonna go to
oldest date added oh my god seven years
ago I created this video how to create
fuller lips and the thumbnail is very
weird it's like me up close like this
it's back before you could even pick a
thumbnail on YouTube and you just hope
that YouTube would give you the best
thumbnail like screenshot I'm so nervous
first of all can we talk about this song
really quick I know it's like just
started but this song is not the song
that I chose I actually chose Akon sexy
back so I think about that song playing
in your head this was back before
YouTube really cared about copyright so
I had that song and then it got flagged
so I changed it to this random song this
video was shot with my iPhone I think it
was iPhone 3 and yes there are cereal
boxes in the background okay so the
first thing that I'm showing you cuz
you're probably like what the heck is
that that is the end of an eyeliner
pencil it's the smudger of an eyeliner
pencil yeah I did not have a lip liner
back then like I I couldn't afford a lot
of makeup so I was very resourceful with
what I had and yes
disclaimer I do have lip injections my
lips are a lot bigger than what they
were seven years ago and back back when
I made videos like this video I didn't
make another video until like the next
year or like six months later I was very
inconsistent I would make a video three
times a year so I don't consider that
like me starting YouTube I think when I
was consistent about it would have to be
back in 2013 like if I wanted to do a
beach look we'd go out to the beach and
that would be like part of the intro and
I cut to music I took off my lips and it
says to get a dark color blend it out
into the corners of your mouth as well
as the bottom lip so what I would do now
is I would take strip down this is
stripped down format which is true if
you want to create a fuller lip you want
to add that dark shadow on the edges or
the corners of your mouth and I actually
learned that from the candy Johnson
that's who I used to watch back in these
times I'm gonna just keep layering this
on until he gets as dark as it was in
the video all right so we got some lip
definition going on there that is a very
close I remember I sat my iPhone on top
of
books and like random things that I
would I could find and that's how I made
my video in the lamp in the back I don't
know if somebody must have given that
lamp to us because I definitely didn't
pick that lamp but that was like my
lighting now take the medium shade and
brush it on top of the darker shade
slightly overlapping the color take the
medium shade okay I'm just gonna take
oak and I'm gonna brush it slightly on
top of the darker shade overlapping the
color okay
I had no eyebrows and I had just mascara
now I'm here with the smokey eye full
lashes I was wearing a Hollister shirt
and I think I don't know if it came like
that where I cut it in it's good I
thought I was soaked you take the
lightest color in the palette and brush
it on the top lip in the cupid bow tie
area the cupid bow tie oh my god
slightly overlapping the other colors
next to it so I'm just gonna go back in
with spice and create that little
Cupid's bow nowadays I like a pointy
Cupid's bow so I'm just gonna enhance
the pointyness I remember when I started
this video when I when I made this video
act like I loved watching makeup
tutorials I wanted to learn everything I
could and you really could I learned so
much from YouTube because I wanted to be
a makeup artist and I wanted to make
other people feel beautiful I would do
other I would do my co-workers makeup
and they would feel amazing so I was
like I want to learn more I want to be
like a pro I want to see how how good I
can get in how far I can go so I I
started I've made this video I didn't
tell anybody about it
I actually hid it from everyone nobody
knew I had a channel or that I made this
video I was just so shy about everything
I didn't want anybody to know especially
C's early
no I was like no look so dumb so I
didn't tell anybody about it and so
crazy because I didn't hardly have
anything but I know I had this passion
and this drive I wanting to be a makeup
artist I wanted to anything that I had I
know I wasn't there all the way on the
skill set I wasn't there with the
products if you see my makeup now this
was this would be like a fantasy I had
no makeup I would like to struggle just
to buy foundation this foundation was
like the most expensive thing for me
that angle though still blending at
least I blend blend blend oh my god how
embarrassing is this get a bubblegum
pink dolly color I'm using a mineral
shadow and put it on the middle part of
the top and bottom lips
you guys get a bubblegum pink dolly
color well I'm gonna say I'm gonna get
Dubai from Oprah it's not a bubblegum
pink dolly color but it is a very nude
shade and that's what I'm gonna use
today just something neutral this is
gonna help blend out harsh lines this
almost reminds me of like a concealer
color but it's really pretty and soft oh
my gosh that is the worst angle you can
see straight up my nose one nostril is
bigger than the other I have a deviated
septum so you could definitely see that
taking a highlighter I'm using Kleenex
Platinum glow number seven brush it on
the Cupid's bow tie Cupid's bow tie area
of your lips and then very middle of the
bottom lip so we're still highlighting
here into the Cupid's bow tie area of my
lips I'm gonna use a Mac Smith highlight
right in the center and blend it out
with my finger and I'm using that
smudger brush from the eyeliner my
lashes are so clumpy by the way take
another light pink jumbo color pencil
and highlight the middle dang I used so
many things to highlight the center of
my lips now use a lot of pink back then
nowadays I would just use a lip gloss
okö by Kylie
and this is one of their glosses in
sugar plum I'm just gonna use this and
this is gonna be like my final highlight
like I've already created the lip
because this is a lot of stuff so I'm
gonna just go in the center of the lips
again and create that pouty highlight
that I was going for and I'm just gonna
dab it with my finger
this will cause light to reflect the
lightest area of the lip creating an
instant pout that's good oh my gosh good
job
oh I remember like I thought that was so
cool and like they would you this is the
color I am using right here like I
thought that was so cool I was a legit
youtuber if I did that Jayden's baby
wipes are in the background - oh we were
messy remember to blend blend blend I've
relieved harsh edges or dark ring of
line around the mouth avoid the clown
face look avoid the clown face look
avoid foundation in your hair I love the
length of my hair almost done okay I
showed something I don't know what it
was but I'm sure it was to clean up
around the mouth let's just see how
where this takes us take a slightly
lighter than your skin color powder and
brush it over the outermost part of your
mouth so that the lips will stand out
even more Fein I hope I could help
remember rate comment and and subscribe
your official makeup artist it is so
crazy that I started from that literally
from from zero I would have never
thought that this would be my life you
don't have to have much to start towards
your goal you just have to start
literally whatever you have no matter
what's going on in your life no matter
how crazy it is or how much you don't
have if you just start that day you
start is gonna be a part of a journey
that is going to change your life and
once I started to believe in myself and
I worked every single day to get closer
and closer to my goal if finally
happen I had a huge moment a huge
turning point in my life in my career it
was a big day I got an email in late
2013
from Ipsy they had seen the videos I was
making and they really liked them and
they wanted me to move out to LA to
become a full-time youtuber and do
videos for them as well so at first
hearing this I'm like this is too good
to be true
like that's something's up with that and
if it is like I just bought a house at
that time me and Ceaser had just bought
a house
really there's there's no way I was a
medical insurance rep like the one who
answers all the questions member
services basically that's what I was and
I was like I'm really comfortable in
this space but in my heart I knew that I
was missing something I wasn't living to
my fullest potential so we decided to
come out here to LA and pursue this
once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing that
you don't ever get those types of like
offers so we moved out here in a little
u-haul Jaden was six years old
of course we drove was a full day I'm
originally from Houston Texas so I'm not
used to like this kind of lifestyle and
I remember just walking looking at
people walk down the street and they all
had a sense of style or singing and it
was just so so different faint so this
was a whole new world for me I was
really excited and very nervous but I
knew that that it could be the start of
something really huge I was working so
hard every single day I was working
really really hard and it was it was
really difficult all that hard work went
into it but I understand growing as fast
as my peers I was like wow I'm working
so hard but I'm not getting anywhere as
fast as these other girls the first year
moving here crying every single day and
I had just moved my whole family out
here to pursue a dream that I'm not
actually doing well at so it was a
really hard moment for me and it's scary
for people that were that loved me and
were very close to me and I had a lot of
those people told me that you know it's
probably time to move back home go back
to your other lifestyle this is not a
for sure thing you don't know where it's
gonna go
I let myself feel that moment of failure
stop it
after I felt that moment it's like I had
already there's something in my heart
that is saying to keep going and I'm not
gonna stop fast-forward to 2017 we're
here I live in LA I'm doing great
I have 2.7 million of you guys who
actually clicked the subscribe button
and wanted to follow me and watch my
videos and learn from them this is my
career and now I have so many
opportunities that I would only dream of
like these are fantasies and looking at
this first video it just makes me
appreciate my journey I've had a few
offers this year to collab with
different brands and I'm so grateful for
those offers but I've my heart is in
another place right now that I want to
focus on something that I've been
working on for a long time something
that is very very very very close to me
that I'm so so excited about and so
grateful that I can actually do this for
myself because I am working on something
very special to my heart it's huge and
I've dreamed of this since I was a
little girl and just looking back at
this first video I came from nothing
like literally if somebody were to look
at that video they would be like she has
no hope now I'm able to create something
for myself because of you guys and
because I took this first step I took my
iphone smudger brush and now I get to
create something that I wish I could
tell you more about I'll be telling you
more information about in the upcoming
weeks that's the end of the video thank
you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed
