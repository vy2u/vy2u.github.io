see the extensions of the bangs just use
your imagination
if this isn't Texas in the 90s I don't
know what is I feel like I should be on
a southern home cooking show right now
oh my god I look like Jim Carrey's
daughter in Dumb and Dumber to look
creepy
oh my gosh hey guys welcome back to my
channel so today I am going to be
recreating my glamour shot picture that
I took it when I was 7 it was 1994 and
they had a really interesting clothing
back then so I was all about the glam
even at a very young age no I was
actually a tomboy growing up but I found
this my mom me my mom actually remember
took these pictures posted him on
Twitter as a throwback Thursday and I
got so much feedback on this picture I
was talking to Patrick and he was like
you should totally recreate this look
it'll be so funny and I just thought it
was a good idea so I decided to try and
recreate the look today so the
background isn't exactly but I tried my
best to get it to what it is and I can't
take myself seriously in this hair and
clothes right now but if you want to see
how I recreated of my glamour shot
picture from back in the day then don't
forget to subscribe to my channel and
hit that notification bow so you can be
a part of the quad family and without
further ado let's get on with this video
all right so we are getting started with
prepping the face I don't know what they
used back in the 90s to prep the face
besides moisturizer I'm not really too
sure but I'm gonna use this Oprah cool
as a cucumber moisturizing primer I just
got it in and it feels so freakin good
I have such old like dry skin and I've
told you guys this so many times so I'm
always looking for the next moisturizing
products for my
especially if it's in a primer so this
is a primer it's an all-in-one it's
gonna smooth it's gonna soothe and it's
gonna hydrate it feels very cushiony on
the skin it's definitely a little bit
tacky so I know that my makeup is gonna
stick to my face I may use this
foundation it's the NARS natural radiant
foundation in Patagonia and I'm gonna
apply it with a Beauty Blender to even
out my skin I don't know what they my
skin looked so good in that picture by
the way this was before acne ever
existed on my face but this foundation
is just so good because it like fills in
and hides texture it hides blemishes red
spots but at the same time it your skin
still looks like skin it doesn't look
like it has caked up foundation all over
the place you know it just looks like
nice things so that's why I really like
this one I'm gonna add some concealer
the one that I've been loving lately is
this Mac water weight concealer and I
like that it just comes in this dropper
it's just fun to apply even though it
does nothing when I apply it like this
it's just so fun to see it go down on
your face like that this is MC 20 in
case you guys are wondering my shade I'm
gonna go ahead and set my lid area with
this wanderlust wander buddy powder
foundation and this is in the shade
medium this is going to mattify and set
everything in place I'm gonna go ahead
and bake because we can't skip on baking
I don't think they did this back in the
day I would love to speak to the makeup
artist that did my makeup on that day
let it sit and marinate for a second
just like that and then I'm gonna work I
think my foundation is pretty dry by now
so I'm gonna go in with my brow pencil
the one that I've been loving lately and
then using it and I travel with it
everywhere is this Dior one it is in the
shade black but it's actually not black
it's a very deep brown I love this
eyebrow pencil and it's super tiny
portable and it has
and it's so cute could just close it up
that's just chic portable and it does an
amazing job so I've been using this
lately I'm just gonna try and follow
that shape that I had before I you know
tweeze the life out of them starting
with this brow that's so crazy to see on
my brows work my brows have always been
like smaller here and thicker out here
try to recreate that that's funny I
always thought I teased my brow weird to
the point where it doesn't it grows in
like this but it actually has always
been like this
and then it comes and then I always
extend my brows so far out I swear I've
always thought that I just over plucked
my brows but I guess I didn't pluck them
out too bad it's just that's how they
are naturally that is crazy okay so this
is how my brows sit naturally on my face
if it was up to me not trying to
recreate my brow exactly not exactly how
it was but the shape of the brow from
when I was a kid I would be changing
them extending them adding more brow
hairs but I'm just gonna leave it
because this is supposed to be how my
natural brow shape would be and I'm
gonna move on to my eyes I remember
being in front of these big lights I was
I remember this little shoot that we did
I remember vaguely but somebody did put
some type of a brush on my eyes so I'm
gonna do just a light wash and in the
picture it almost looks like I have like
a gold like a oranjee gold kind of color
right on the inner corners do you like a
natural crease like a natural contoured
eye crease so I'm gonna take the
Dominique Lotte palette I'm gonna take
caramel and mix a little bit of mocha in
there
I'm going to take a vanilla cream and
just pop it on to my lid so it looks
nice and bright okay I think we're done
I want a very soft the most natural
looking crease that you have ever seen
that's what I what I'm going for and
then for the inner corners I do have a
little bit of something there so I'm
gonna take creme brulees that actually
works perfect and then all I had on was
mascara for my lashes so what I'm gonna
do is take a mascara and the new one
that actually just came out from benefit
is really really good so I'm gonna take
that one and it's super cute packaging
it's this one right here it's called bad
gal bang the wand is really really nice
and angled and narrow towards the very
tip and wider at the end and just the
bristles are so tiny they grab onto
every single lash and pull them out so I
really like this is gonna pull out all
your secrets
all the lashes on the bottom where will
come out you see how far that comes out
so I'm gonna take one of the most
natural looking lashes of my favorite
lashes these are the Lily lashes and
Goddess they look like so they're so
pretty and they are gonna be a little
long longer than what I had in the
picture these are my natural lashes so
it looks like I had blush on most of the
makeup was just mascara blush and lips
so I had like a light pink blush on so
I'm going to take this really pretty
g'way blush duo and I'm gonna take this
blush right here this is called tease me
it's the Coquette blush duo and pop it
on to my cheeks looks like they had it
right where I smile like right here my
nose I feel like was so much cuter when
I was seven because now it's like
crooked and it's not as like round and
cute so I'm gonna contour my nose
that's the only thing I'm gonna contour
my face was pretty full and almost looks
like I may have had a little bit of
bronzer on my cheeks so actually I'm in
a contour a little bit because it looks
like I had a little something going on
my cheek so I'm gonna just contour this
sides a little bit and then the nose
we're really gonna go in I'm contouring
with it by the way you guys cuz I show
it so much the Kat Von D shade in like
pilot just taking the middle shade in
the palette and the first shade I'm
going down my nose
I basically contour my nose to look like
how it was when I was a kid anyway so
I'm just gonna keep the same kind of
method I go around the nose right here
to make it look a little bit more turned
up and then I go ahead and cut off this
full point eat area and it's a little
bit shorter and then I curve in right
here just so it looks more rounded and
button and then I'm gonna go back over
with a banana shade actually in my
palette because it's not as yellow as
the one in the shade and light palette
so I'm just gonna get across like that
I'm gonna go with the urban decay
trivial liquid lip a little bit darker
but it's pretty pretty accurate it looks
like this Center on my lip was a little
bit highlighted okay so it's a little
bit darker so I'm going to lighten it up
with the L'Oreal color riche shining
peach shade just okay this is perfect
tada the only thing we're missing is the
hair so I decided to do the hair on
camera for you guys so they didn't think
it was gonna be enough makeup to
actually be a makeup tutorial
I think the way they curled hair then
was just with curl curlers there was no
curling wands so it was a little bit
bigger and like more billowy and fluffy
so this is gonna look a little bit
different but we are going to make it
work and then each layer I'm just gonna
fluff up so I'm gonna take my teasing
brush and add volume cuz there was a lot
of volume going on actually I faced hi
my little sister and my mom was showing
her the picture and she was like you
look like you have a wig on or you have
a hat so my hair was super to mind you
this was in Texas it probably was all
over the United States at this point but
for sure in Texas big hair has always
been like a thing so maybe that's why
but yeah we had big hair so did my mom
my mom did glamor shots on the same day
her hair was so big if I could find a
picture I will put it in here
and I will show you her glamour shots to
show I would be really embarrassed but
she won't mind talking won't be really
embarrassed but we'll see it will talk
to her to see she'll let us put it up so
you guys can see it but I'm just gonna
curl this part of my hair if you see
this it's just the tag to the shirt that
I tried to make out of a vest
hey my hair was much shorter was like I
cut my own bangs
but I'd need to curl them I guess oh my
god this is going to look hilarious
oh my gosh you guys this is so weird
okay I can't with this hair I give up on
the hair but this is basically what we
did know for the last part of this load
I'm going to put on these weird earrings
that actually made myself to look like
the picture so I just added an extra
pair of earrings split it through the
back so it looks a little bit bulkier
just let's pretend that you can't see
the extensions of the bangs just use
your imagination
this isn't Texas in the 90s I don't know
what is thank you guys for watching I
hope you enjoyed this video if you did
and you want to see more things like
this I think they're just so hilarious
then don't forget to let me know in the
comments and before I let you go I want
you to just find a baby picture and look
at your brows to see if you're doing
them in the correct shape I just want
you to go look back at your baby picture
it my the only one that realizes that my
brow shape is just naturally like this
go and look through your baby pictures

baby picture and tag me so I can see

so fun actually post a picture of
yourself a baby picture I want to see
