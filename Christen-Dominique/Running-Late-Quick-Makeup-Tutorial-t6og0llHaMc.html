Fuji - it's so funny it's called dating
a youtuber be like are you doing nothing
I'm just watching this video so funny
don't you have to leave in 15 minutes
what guys welcome back to my channel so
today I'm going to be doing this super
quick and easy makeup look this is when
you're rushing out of the door you have
no time to get ready but you still need
to look put together if you're a mom on
the go if you're rushing to go to school
and you're almost late this can apply to
any of you guys and you will look really
good really put together and nobody will
ever know you were rushing so if you
want to learn how to get this look then
keep watching okay so when I am in a
total rush I skip everything I skip like
when I'm really really running late this
is what I grab for my makeup for ever
ultra foundation stick I grab it put it
all over my face it's so easy because
you could just like you know it doesn't
matter how you put it on as long as
you're covering what you need to cover
this thing covers everything you can
cover your tattoo I feel like run it all
over your face and you're good to go
blend it like I don't even need
concealer really and this foundation
stick is super full coverage you know
your skin's gonna look flawless you're
not going to look tired because it's
going to completely cover up your
under-eye circles so I just put it under
my under eyes blend it in really quick
done if you're running white this is all
you need this is it this is your life
when you're in a hurry for that I'm
going to take my contour stick this is
actually not a contour stick this is the
same foundation just in a different
shade this is a lot darker and I'll use
this just to quickly contour or you can
totally skip this step if you think this
can go very wrong for you very quickly
I'm just used to doing it but if you use
your Beauty Blender it helps you blend
it out a lot easier and if you notice
I'm talking kind of funny it's because I
have my bottom retainer on because I
haven't been wearing it in a really
long time I haven't been able to find it
in my teeth I can feel our shifting like
I could just feel something shifting
there I just put it on and it's really
tight and it kind of hurts so I'm gonna
wear it I don't want my cheese to go
crooked the beauty blender blends
everything out super fast super easy and
quick
so grab your Beauty Blender grab your
foundation sticks you're good to go
and for my brows I'm going to use this
color pop brow pencil in a bank--and
brunette and I'm going to just brush
them out for foundation is probably in
between my brows right now quickly fill
in my brows
now I'm going to go in set everything
with my powder I'm going to use this
powder right here is from Kat Von D this
is another full coverage you know I love
my full coverage this is another full
coverage powder that's going to make you
look absolutely flawless I'm going to
use my the bomb powder brush which is so
cute I love this handle by the way so
adorable so I'm going to go ahead and
set my foundation so it doesn't slide
around and you can do this really quick
make sure you bring it down to your neck
and then I'm going to take my shade
light palette right here and my lighter
powder quickly brighten up those under
eyes so if you want to make sure your
eyelids are even go ahead and put the
altar right on top of your lid done next
I'm going to take my bronzer my bronzer
I'm taking the urban decay beached
bronzer this is in bronze and I'm going
to use this on my eyes and cheeks that's
all I'm going to use it's gonna be
really quick really fast we're gonna
look alive so I'm going to take my Smith
118 brush and I'm going to apply some on
my cheeks to add some color to my face
I'm also going to take it around my
temples bring some warmth to my face
another thing bronzer does is help you
look slimmer so slim it up
I'm gonna take my crease brush this is
the morphe m-44 one and I'm just gonna
work it into my crease just going to
create depth in your eye make it look
like you're not running late
as I like to put eyeshadow on the bottom
of my lashline um and then I'm going to
do a quick wing if you're not used to
doing wings skip the wing go straight to
the mascara and you're basically done
but I'm going to go ahead and do my wing
because this is something I am used to
doing I have to do it it just would feel
weird if I didn't do it so I'm gonna do
my ring really quick and this is my Kat
Von D tattoo liner in trooper this is my
favorite liner because it just glides on
your eye so I'm going to do my wing
really quick
curl my lashes and then apply some
mascara if you want to know a really
quick tip to make your eyelashes look
fuller thicker and longer and you're
just using mascara what you do is you
brush your lashes in the opposite
direction so I'm brushing them this way
and then you brush them the other way
then you brush them out so one two out
and it looks so much thicker and fuller
you can like see the difference it's
kind of like when you put your hair in
the opposite direction it looks fuller
it's not used to going that way same
thing with your lashes so weird but it
works
and just let your eyelashes dry and then
once you get in the car or whenever you
have some free time or when you're at
the stop light or something problem
really quick super long and curl just
give them some time to dry before you
take an eyelash curler to us for my lips
I'm just going to use well first I'm
going to use this lip balm this is from
glossier you can actually just leave
like this and you'll look fine but I'm
going to put a little bit of lip liner
on this is from gerard cosmetics this is
a nude
