today I'm going back to my roots with
this dark hair and channeling my inner
Selena Gomez today and I saw this video
it was completely obsessed with the look
so I decided to recreate it for you guys
and so if you want to learn how to get
it thank you watch before I get started
with my makeup I'm going to go ahead and
take out my Ipsy glam bag and use some
of the products from the bag I'm
starting off at the dr. Brandt pore
dermabrasion and this is going to deep
cleanse my pores and also smooth out any
uneven skin texture next I'm picking up
B my amazing hair secrets leave-in
secret spraying conditioner and it's
going to help hydrate my hair and repair
any split ends next I'm grabbing the
theory argan oil
ultimate reformed hair serum and this is
going to soften the cuticle and
strengthen any brittleness that you have
in your hair and to make sure that my
body and hands are moisturize I'm using
the more emporium classics hand in body
lotion and this is going to make your
skin really really soft and it has a
really nice delicate scent and lastly
i'm just applying a little bit of
perfume now let's get started with the
makeup tutorial so I'm priming my face
first and using the step 1 base hydrate
from Make Up For Ever and then I'm going
to take my professional to fill in any
pores and fine lines that can open it I
like to take the pore fessional really
just like in the t-zone area Pat it in
there ok so now we're going to do my
foundation the foundation I'm using is
from L C and this is a natural try not
to get the foundation in the hair so
this foundation is super lightweight but
it's literally light to full coverage
it's like it's very buildable and I find
that it works best with a Beauty Blender
sometimes it takes a little while for it
to build the coverage but if you just
let it dry and then apply
other layer let it dry apply another
layer then you'll get a very natural
full coverage so it doesn't look cakey
it isn't it looks like your skin is
awesome now it's time to conceal the
under eyes or as I like to call them
panda eyes I'm taking a little bit of my
mac prolongwear concealer I just put it
on the back of my hand I kind of like to
put everything on the back of my hand I
like to lightly bounce the Beautyblender
onto my skin I feel like this gives you
the best looking coverage and it's
definitely one of my favorite tools for
foundation so next I'm taking my luck C
211 concealer brush and some black gel
liner and may use this as a base for our
black smokey eye and as you can see it's
going to look really messy really crazy
but that's okay because of course I feel
like we all need to say this in unison
like everyone said we're gonna blend it
out later
okay so with editing it makes it look
super fast super easy and quick but it
does take some time to smooth out that
gel liner it's black so be careful it
does get everywhere it is it can get
messy really fast so just be very
careful and take your time so now I'm
going to take my naked smoky palette I'm
finally using it guys I haven't opened
it since I got it so I just picked up my
luck C 231 small tapered blending brush
and I use this for my crease it has a
tapered brush head for a detailed
precision and control blending and it's
very soft in there synthetic bristles so
everything's going to blend nice and
easy and I'm going to focus the brown
shade right on the crease
I'm gonna go in with black market and
I'm gonna place that right on top of the
lid focus most of the pigment on the lid
but then softly blend it upwards kind of
overlapping the brown alright so let's
get the brow bone highlighted I'm going
to use combust which is a light pink
toby shade and i'm gonna place it right
on the brow bone and then I'm going to
drag it down into those other colors so
that everything looks nice and blended
and smooth and then with this um bluish
gray color right here it's a dagger I'm
gonna place that right on the center of
the lid right where the eyeballs would
be and then with a black pencil I'm just
halfway lining my waterline and then
going in with some black shadow or the
inner corner highlight I'm going to take
the Naked cosmetics mica pigment the
Sierra Nevada number two it's like a
champagne shimmery nude shade and it's
highly pigmented you can use it on your
eyes face lips anywhere but I'm going to
use it right on my inner corners and I'm
using a tiny pencil brush to do this for
the top lashes I'm using the Marc Jacobs
mascara and then I'm going to use the
their real lashes from benefit on the
lower lashes because it just pulls out
every tiny hair and I love how it does
that it makes it look so pretty and full
and then I'm taking the also Flash's
iconic style lashes and I'm placing them
on my eyeballs you know to make sure
there isn't any white glue marks on my
eyes I'm just taking a liner this is the
Kat Von D tattoo liner and I'm going
over at the lash band with concealer I'm
using the NARS concealer just to make
sure everything's nice bright and extra
concealed after I do my eyes I always
like to go back over with another
concealer and then I'm just gonna do a
natural contour when I do natural I mean
like cream contours because cream
contours tend to look a lot more natural
than the powdery contours and they don't
get patchy especially if you have like
acne prone skin or blemishes that just
or scarring that just won't go away if
you have any of these problems cream
contour would be the best for your skin
type
now we're going to make sure that our
creams aren't sliding around anywhere so
I'm going to take a outer and I'm going
to lightly dust it over the top of my
skin just to make sure that everything
is loft in there and then with the Tarte
East palette and just going to contour a
little bit more just going over these
areas just to make sure they're extra
defined and I'm just going over the same
places that I went over with a cream
contour and I want to add just a light
bronze to my skin so I'm just going to
go over my cheekbones and temples with
this and then with this yellow powder as
well as that natural cream shade I'm
going to go over my under-eye circles
just to brighten them up even more also
it's going to help everything underneath
really stay in place all day I also like
to go over the dark areas around my
mouth and then I'm gonna take this blush
palette from Tarte the blush shade that
I'm using is prim prim is a very nice
universal color and it's going to go
right on my cheek bones and then for the
highlight I'm using hourglass ambient
light and I'm going to place that on my
nose and all my Cupid's bow onto the
lips I'm going in with the urban decay
Gwen Stefani ex-girlfriend lipliner
beautiful color but what's even better
about this lip liner is the formula it
feels like a lipstick it's a buttery
creamy I love it and then on top of that
I'm going in with pure Hollywood from
Anastacio it's a liquid lipstick and
then to add some shine to my lips I'm
applying the model co lip lacquer in
Morocco it's a lip gloss and it's
long-lasting full coverage I love this
lip combo I feel like I could wear this
every day and I think it would look
beautiful on anybody like it would
naturally enhance anybody's lips
beautifully
