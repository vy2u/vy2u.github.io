today I'm going to be doing the Selena
Gomez same old love music video makeup I
was so excited when this came out I'm
always super excited but I was really
excited about this one because I have
been hunting down a celebrity inspired
look for about a year now I think the
last one I did was probably at the
beginning of the year but I was really
excited about this one because she had a
look that you know you would want to
recreate oh when I saw this I was like
yeah yeah yeah because I love the song I
love her and she's finally doing
something dramatic with her makeup and
it looks so beautiful so I hope you guys
enjoy this video I really love this
makeup look I knew you guys are and
let's get started so I just came back
from New York in my hands like my entire
body is super dry especially my hands
and since I'm using everything from the
FC glam bag is came in it this is the
delectable hand cream in coconut cream
it smells really good so I'm gonna just
put that on before I start kissing hands
are really really dry lately
did you notice my nail polish but this
is a really pretty blue fall color have
the aurora gel effect nail lacquer and
this is in the color inky dink really
it's so cute it's called inky dinky okay
for my foundation today I'm going to use
the LC I know it's running out it's
because I usually use it so much I love
it
I'm just going to do this it gives you
so much coverage but it's not heavy one
of those that you have to build and
build and build and definitely use a
Beauty Blender with it and my face is a
lot lighter than my body because I fake
baked this weekend for Jen Beauty so I
made sure that it was super super dark I
am NOT this tan this is the color of
using for now I feel super lucky now
right now these big hoop earrings you
cover my under-eye circles I've been
using the Mac Pro Longwear I'm an NC 25
and this stuff you just need a little
dot and it is very high coverage that
was one little dot okay so now I'm done
with my face I'm gonna do my brows I'm
using touching soles browses super gel I
obviously cannot open this because I
just put lotion on my hand actually I
think I need help yeah I can't open it
open if you're hey I'm using the touch
insole browses super proof gel brow
pencil and this is in mink link for the
shadows I'm using this cargo the
essentials palette taking urban rush
hour in City Hall kind of mixing those
together to create the shade right here
in my crease and I'm going to be using
windshield wiper motions to work that
into the crease also you want to make
sure you're blending upwards towards
your brow bone with this this is going
to be the base for our crease and then
I'm using these city color spice me up
palette and just using my ring finger
I'm just going to apply the metallic e
shade right onto the lid just like
Selena Gomez has in the video and then
I'm taking a matte Brown and my flat
shader brush to work that into the outer
part of the crease to add some drama to
the eyes and then with a clean brush
with nothing on it I'm blending out the
edges so it's nice and hazy and you can
actually use your shader brush for this
just use the clean side and work it
upwards but mine was a little too dirty
the eyeliner really attracted me to this
look so her on liner is over exaggerated
in the inner corners which I love I've
never tried this before so it was really
fun to do so what I did first was just
map out how where the eyeliner was going
to start and end and then I kind of
filled in the rest slowly filling it in
as I go so it's nice and clean and then
I went in with a la girl I pencil this
is kind of a champagne color and and
then I went in with a clean eyeliner
brush just to make sure the flick is
nice and sharp it was a little bit too
yellowy for me so I went and grabbed the
Uptown eyeshadow and this is more of a
white matte shade I just went over that
with
angled liner brush and then went back
into my waterline and also added the
champagne color after that I took
brownstone which is that matte brown
shade and I went right under the
waterline and just blended this out make
sure was really nice and hazy right
under the lash line like selena has in
the video
I mean Selena Gomez you killed it on
this look whoever did her makeup killed
it it looks beautiful
for the lashes I'm using the it
cosmetics hello lashes mascara in black
this mascara finds lashes that you
didn't even know were there I'm just
saying it it gives you a tons of volume
of tons this cute girl came up to me at
Jen beauty and she handed me these
lashes and she's like oh can you please
try these and I was like oh cool things
oh when I opened up I never realized
that there were gonna be this amazing
like the lashes look very natural and
wispy they're definitely high-quality
lashes they're not cheeky plasticky
lashes and the band is super thin so
it's really natural and easy to cover so
thanks for the lashes Sofia I'm going to
set my palette I messed up my elbow I'm
going to set my foundation and to do
that lately I've just been using a
translucent powder this is the Laura
Mercier translucent powders I've been
using the translucent powder a whole lot
lately just because it doesn't give me a
layer of extra color if that makes sense
I just like the way it makes my
foundation look it just makes it look so
smooth and flawless and then for
contouring i'm using the Kat Von D
palette just contouring the hollows of
the cheekbones sides of the nose and
temples to brighten my under eyes I'm
using the brightening powder in the
palette and mixing it with the nanika
Darwin to lighten and brighten so now
I'm gonna put some blush on my cheeks
I'm using the Laura Geller baked blush
and brighten this is entropic hues right
here and I'm just going to take my
stippling brush just apply a little bit
to my cheek bone get a very natural soft
cheek so this works
for the lips she had like a Maki golden
lip look so I am using the NYX butter
lipstick and pops
actually this is a little bit brighter
than what she had so I have this other
lipstick that I'm thinking of using so
I'm just going to add it right on top
and this one is from the Golani line
this is in brick and for the gold flecks
that she hasn't used the charlotte
tilbury i'm Lipson cheek duo I'm taking
this color right here which is an
eyeshadow from makeup geek just going to
take a little bit of that and pop it
onto the center before I head out I know
I'm going to be around out and about so
am I smell good I have this perfume here
that came in the bag this is called Eau
de perfume from aromachology and this is
the exotic and spicy
