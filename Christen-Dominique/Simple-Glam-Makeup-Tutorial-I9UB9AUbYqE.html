doing this look for you guys right here
it's a neutral eye a wing and a pop of
color on the lower lash line and if you

obsessed with my nails I finally got
them done and I am obsessed they are new
they are blue shout out to Queen nail
thank you
I asked you guys what colors I should
choose and you guys choose this one I
love it I love it a lot okay so let's go
ahead and get into the makeup I'm not
going to go into too much detail but I'm
going to tell you what I'm using on my
skin because if I don't then I feel like
I'm not being thorough with you guys so
I'm gonna be using the hangover RX
primer all over my face and then because
I don't I don't want to cheat you guys
I'm going to be using this hourglass I
know it's really messy I'm going to be
using this hourglass foundation right
here and this is in nude and I'm also
because I'm crazy just a little bit just
a little bit I'm gonna be using the Make
Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation stick
with it and why 335 so I'm just gonna
quickly work the primer onto my face
blah blah blah
no I'll know how to put on the primer
I'm gonna go into the foundations this
is why 335 from makeup forever
and then on the inner part of my face i
take the hourglass vanishing foundation
stick and just because this is a lot
more precise and it has a little bit
more coverage than the makeup for
everyone now I'm ready for more with my
damp my damp out maybe mud I am going to
blend this out really quick we are
moving on to the under eyes and we're
gonna use the Tarte shape tape and
light/medium because this is Bay this is
my other Bay I have I have two bays in
my legs I mean a lot to me these are it
besides Jayden and Ceaser so I'm gonna
go ahead and use the shape tape you guys
know this is like one of the best
concealers out there right now I was
obsessed in love with Urban Decay
naked skin but then I found this and it
stole my heart and we've been
inseparable ever since
ever since going down my nose in the
middle of my forehead chin suds of the
mouth it tends to get pretty dark in
that area I'm gonna go into the brows
I'm into my brows off-camera I'm going
to be using my precise of my brow from
benefit surprise surprise
you guys know if I'm doing anything to
my brows it's usually from benefit I
have eyebrows again whoa okay so go
ahead and pick up this color right here
I'm going to be using the BH Cosmetics
illuminate by Ashley Tisdale brush and
it starts to work that all over my lid
just pack it on I'm also going to work
it all the way up to the brow bone but
we're gonna really focus this color
right on the lid right here I'm gonna
use a very light hand bringing it up
again because I just want to even out
the entire eyelid but I just want this
little space right here to be very
concentrated with that light pale pink
color and now I'm going to go ahead and
jump into this palette right here it's
called B by bubs Beauty this is a
collaboration with BH Cosmetics and this
is such a pretty palette I'm going to be
using this really pretty shade right
here it's called optimistic I'm going to
take this brush right here it's pretty
flat what is this
that's a Mac 242 so I'm going to go
ahead and work this into my crease and
what I'm doing is taking this topi matte
shade right here and I'm just going to
map out where I want my crease to start
and so what I'm doing is just literally
placing my brush down like this and then
I'm flicking it upwards towards the brow
bone I'm going to keep doing that until
I have the intensity that I want where
the crease starts and then with a clean
brush this one right here this is the BH
Cosmetics and number six one of the
ashley tisdale illuminate brushes and
I'm just going to go back and forth to
blend out the edges and I'm going to go
back and forth into optimistic to
intensify it so same thing with the
other I use this brush is from SL miss
glam Beauty this is a small eyeshadow
brush in p16 and so cute right I'm going
to I'm going to pick up inspired I'm
going to work that on too
the lower part of the crease I don't
want to bring it all the way in I feel
like my eyes are pretty close together
and if I put darker shades here it's
just going to look even closer so I try
to keep everything that's dark right on
the outer parts of my eye now if your
eyes are a little bit more wider and
spaced apart you can really go in
whenever you're using those dark shades
right here because it's going to balance
your eyes out with your face but for me
I'm just going to keep it right on the
outside so I like this to be the
brightest part of my brow bone like
right where the high point is and then
I'll just fade both sides I'll bring it
down so that it fades into the other
colors and everything looks nice and
blended so now I'm just going to create
a wing and to do that I'm using my Tarte
liquid liner I'm going to go ahead and
put on a few coats of mascara I'm using
this one from Mac the false lashes
mascara now I'm going to pop on some
lashes I'm going to be using these ones
from violet boss these are called wispy
my name so I'm gonna put those on and I
will be right back
okay so I just got this in from Mac this
is the strobe cream and before I set my
face I want to use this this is in the
shade gold light this has like a gold
shimmer to it and I'm just gonna put
that right on tops of the cheekbone like
where I would usually highlight put some
on my nose so I'm just gonna put that on
the Cupid's bow and right on the chin so
now I'm going to set all the creams on
my face so they won't move I'm going to
set them with a powder I'm going to be
using this one right here from Tarte and
I'm just going to work that all over my
face now I'm gonna do a little bit of
contouring so I'm going to take this in
I'm AK 109 and start to kind of contour
hollow out my cheekbones a little bit
more so now we are good to go I'm going
to put on some bronzer and I'm going to
be using this a BH Cosmetics palette
right here this nude blush 10 color
blush palette and I'm going to pick up a
bronzy looking shade I'm going to take
this one right here mixing it with a
little bit of this and start to work
that all over the cheek bring it up into
the temples and then for the blush I'm
going to take this pinky shade right
here and pop that on to the apples of my
cheeks and push it back towards the
hairline if you get too much on your
brush take a clean brush and just blend
that out if it has powder on the brush
even better now we are going back to the
eyes i'ma finish up the lower lash line
and I'm going to be taking this really
pretty purple I'm going to start with
this light purple and then go into this
dark one so I'm just going to work that
on the lower lash line I'm going to go
into this darker shade right here this
matte plum and work that into the lower
lash line as well we're still going to
have that light purple peak through so
we can have that nice gradient effect
I'm going to go in with this tapered
brush this tapered pencil brush and just
blend out the edges so there isn't any
harsh lines here and then for my
waterline I'm going to take this you
weigh a slim cream eyeliner in a matte
plum and look that on my waterline now
I'm going to get on to the highlight so
I'm going to use my Mac double gleam
extra dimension skin finish and I'm just
going to pop that on to my cheekbones
don't stop piling on the highlight until
you literally are ready to blind
somebody's eyes out yes that is blind
able so now I can go on to the next one
and then I'll do my nose Cupid's bow and
the chin get for my for my lips I'm
going to go into this lip liner right
here this is from Make Up For Ever in
number 12 I like to over draw the
Cupid's bow and make it a little bit
more
pointy
looks weird huh but I'm going to blend
it into my that little bit too amazing
today this one is from two-faced
it's called me so pretty I want to add
some gloss on top I'm going to pop on
this gloss from Tarte this is basic and
I'm just going to put it on the center
when you put anything that's glossy or
shimmery on the center of your lips it's
going to make your lips look a little
bit more bigger and pouty err okay
speaking of velocity I have this new
matte lip gloss
it's so cute looks like this and it's
called dazzle gloss I think this one's
called P iff so that is what it's called
and I'm just going to add a little bit
to the center it's basically like
highlighting for your lips and that is
the finished thanks for watching I hope
