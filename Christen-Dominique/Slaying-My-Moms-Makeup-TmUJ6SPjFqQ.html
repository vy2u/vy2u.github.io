today I have my mom with me
so it's aggravations here she's actually
visiting from out of town
she's funky some Texas that's where I'm
originally from I just slept my neck
really hard yeah down isolate her face
today and this is the final result you
like it I like it
I'm not used to it not used to wearing
that much makeup she actually she's
really into skincare actually gonna have
her own Med Spa pretty soon so I'm
really excited about that we're gonna be
young forever mom that's the goal that
is the goal she's here I'm so excited I
figured we should film a video together
and you guys haven't seen her other than
on my snapchat and my interest stories
and I get so many comments about you
guys wanting to know more about me and
about my family so here we are
y'all know Caesar very well you've seen
Jaden and now you have my mom her name
is Silvia and she is amazing she's a
Virgo
she likes long walks on the beach but if
you guys want to see how I slayed my
mom's face you want to keep watching but
before you go and watch this video make
sure to subscribe below and hit that
notification bell over there there she
goes and be a part of the quad family I
know this this is the new quad
understand cotton quad if you want to
learn how to get this look or if you
want to just see my mom slay then keep
watching start we always like to
moisturize her face right mom
right as you taught me that yes this is
the o thermal event and this is a rich
compensating cream I read it off the
bottle the two this is going to just
moisturize your skin give it a lot of
hydration and I'm actually gonna wash my
hands before I put it on her face what
can you wash up this moisturizer on and
this is like an ultra rich hydrating
cream and it's supposed to absorb
moisture super quick so it doesn't sit
on your face and feel greasy I haven't
done somebody's else's makeup in a very
time I hope you remember I think think
Oh bi whatever even doing bonding we've
been hanging out we did a spa today
which was really relaxing good massages
mm-hmm next we're gonna prime her face
this is the no poor Blum primer get it
it hides pores and wrinkles which is
awesome any thought it's supposed to
prevent oil production so that your
makeup goes on smooth tubes life oh oh I
feel it it's kind of cushiony when I
have cushiony feeling primers they
usually made with silicone so you want
to tap them into your skin so what this
is going to do is get into her pores and
it's going to fill in those fine lines
and large pores so your skin looks
smooth and your makeup goes on really
nice and even supposed to feel velvety -
it feels very soft does it yes yeah I
feel soft on my hands then we're just
gonna put on a little bit of foundation
my mom has amazing skin already I didn't
get that so I still have breakouts she
moisturizes like crazy what else do you
do because if you look at her skin it is
flawless look at the camera MA it's
perfect I'm so jelly why I'm gonna go
ahead and put this on my hand this is
from LC it's her micro silk foundation
this is in the shade vanilla and so I'm
just gonna put them on my hand and then
I'm gonna take this new fresh Beauty
Blender you can tell there's like
nothing on it it's super squeaky clean
and it's baby pink it's one of the new
Beauty blenders and all I really want to
do is just make one even skin tone she
doesn't need much coverage I'm just
evening out her skin tone and covering
up the redness and of course you want to
take it down to the neck my mom actually
does not wear foundation she just wears
concealer and I always give her a ton of
makeup and she says and I gave her a
bunch of foundation and she goes oh I
used that for my legs like okay Emma
this is why your skin so flawless like
she's been using it in the wrong place
the whole time um open your eyes and
look up and you have freckles I realize
that like right across here you know
freckles are in right now
are they really yeah people draw fake
freckles on oh wow
so freckles I try to cover mine up with
a concealer no people try to show it wow
yeah that's a thing right this
foundation is the best to do a white I
just remembered something you told me
what you made a comment about beating my
face Oh like horrified now I understand
why they stopped gonna do a light little
B intermission hmm we did that at the
same time to cover her under eye circles
I'm gonna go ahead and use this amazing
cosmetics concealer so I'm just gonna
get a little bit on the back of my hand
diarrhea
okay bounce that underneath thigh to
look up to the heavens this is a very
full coverage concealer it's gonna come
out with your dad - yeah see that
working its magic
well that works amazing yes I was like
when did I do this last I don't I
remember doing someone's makeup I don't
remember who and I just realized I did
Cesar's makeup and the lighter you tap
the more coverage you get the lids I
like to use concealer as primer mom
especially if you have what I wouldn't
say your skin is mature yet but you are
a little bit older than me so I'm just
gonna say it even for myself I like to
use concealer as primer because it's way
more hydrating and I naturally have
really dry skin so I'm gonna go ahead
and do your brows and I'm gonna use a
brow powder I'm going to use this
amazing brow brush if you're looking
forward well brush that is a very narrow
precise has an amazing spoolie at the
end this is the one you need this is
from a blink it's the brow and liner duo
brush they're actually in Sephora now
it's from a blink beauty thanks mom my
mom has better nails in me right now so
I'd be my hand model today so I'm just
gonna fill in the sparse area I'm a
message from Thais shots - and look at
how I like a mustache no I'll make it
one summer okay okay so the eyeshadow
that we're gonna the eyeshadow palette
that we're using is from Shu way this is
their spring I should have pilot my mom
actually picked this one out as she
wanted to use it was so pretty these are
the shades right here and I'm gonna
start off with this shade I'm gonna
start off with this shade right here
it's petal it's a pastel pink color I'm
gonna go ahead and apply it to the
entire lid take a morphe m5 21 brush to
pack it all over the lid
so now I'm going to start working into
the crease and I'm going to grab this
fluffy brush from the makeup Shack this
is the t12 brush right here we got it
that's the t12 brush right there thank
you so I'm going to take this light
taupe shade right here and I'm going to
focus the darker shades towards the
outer part of her eye I love fun colors
are so prettyy fun so I'm going to go in
with this one now
to deepen up the crease a little bit
more so I'm starting at the outer end of
the lid and going all the way up to the
end of the brow and circular motions so
now we're going to go in with a deeper
shade of purple this dark shade right
here so I'm going to go ahead and take
that matte purple and intensify the
outer crease I'm actually gonna go in
with that pedal shade and just lighten
up the inner corners I'm gonna go ahead
and highlight your brow bone sure so we
have a lot of Matt's on the eye so I'm
going to illuminate the inner corners
I'm going to use this mica beauty
highlighting powder in number three
right here like it's a lightweight
formula and it's going to give you a
sheer coverage but a really pretty glow
I'm going to place that right on the
inner corners to bring some light here
so for the wing I'm going to use the
Jessie's Girl liquid eyeliner
this one's waterproof so I'm going to go
ahead and create a wing so from s K I'm
going to use the bomb mad lash and I'm
just gonna sweep it through the lashes
to get them ready for some falsies I'm
gonna put on some lashes I'm going to
use these guys these are from House of
lashes these are the noir fairy light so
we are going to pop these on real quick
so you pop the lashes on now I'm gonna
do the contouring and highlighting I'm
going to contour with liquids because I
think that's easier and it looks more
natural contour needs the pop Beauty
camouflage 101 pile a bunch of creams
that you can contour highlight with I'm
going to take the darkest one this shade
over here you actually have really high
those in our family if you like so I'm
starting at the ear and then I'm just
working it down keep the contour moving
upwards
so I'm going to take the Frankie Rose
Pro contour palette I'm going to Pat
that in there and set the under eyes and
this is the luck see dreamcatcher
precision foundation brush I'm just
going to set it has a round shape and it
fits right underneath the eyes perfectly
so it's really good for setting the
creams in place I'm gonna go ahead and
take the ciatÃ© London mini bamboo
bronzer in Star Island so this is going
to help modify the cheek area and also
add some color to warm up her face and
it's going to give her just a radiant
natural looking glow and this powder
actually minimizes the appearance of
texture which is awesome so next I'm
going to highlight and I'm going to be
using this cute little mary lou manizer
highlight and you can use this as an
eyeshadow or a highlight for just
shimmer so pretty so I'm just going to
take that and pop it onto the tops of
the cheeks so for the lip since we have
dramatic eyes I'm going to go with a
neutral pink spring color this is called
the be legendary liquid pigment and I
like this lippy because it has a contour
to it so whenever you apply it it just
fits on your lips so perfectly I'll have
you put it on long it doesn't make it
easy to apply mm-hmm and it feels really
comfortable on the lips too so you don't
have any lipstick on so I'm gonna put
one right now this is pink drink I think
that one is the one year you have on is
called bad B so the one my mom has on is
bad B and mine is she drank
