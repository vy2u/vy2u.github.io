Channel today I have Hart with me we're
turning her into a puking rainbow you
already did
I mean I already did the Mitch wet here
already I think this is a awesome
last-minute costume idea we decided to
make them pastel because their look I
think it was cuter matcha powder
I feel like regular colors are cute too
but yeah I feel like pastel is much more
ya know I had a lot of fun doing this
and then we did the chipmunk or the
squirrel looking filter from snapchat on
Harts channel so make sure to go check
it out the link will be below also at
the end of this video so yeah let's just
puke into the video
so this one's fun because we're going to
do pastel like a pastel color rainbow so
going to be using this white one a lot
this is the flash palette for make it
forever
if you don't have this you can go to the
local Halloween store and just grab the
colors you need and just mix it with
water in that works too we're going to
go ahead and start off with a pink which
is super cute I'm just mixing this hot
pink right here in this white color and
I'm putting it on the back of my hand I
kind of already mixed it it's right
there I'm nervous and also excited I
really Kristin I can't really talk much
like this is so serious so and then
we're gonna do let's do purple like a
lilac color oh my gosh yes please
lavender knows my name they don't have
purple but we can make purple just mix
red and blue together and then a little
bit of white Kristin this
so it's going dark like this once you
have the purple color take a little bit
of the white color and mix it in with
the purple and this is going to make it
lavender
oh my god it's low ready I'm so obsessed
with that color right now I don't know
it is but it's like it's pretty anything
recovering
grandma he Jaden - I'm just making her
into cooking rainbow roses over here my
homeless person of course it's me okay
what other granddaughter from another
mother oh my gosh you guys look at that
oh I'm excited me Bo Peep goals I feel
like this is even better than the
snapchat filter one I should make her I
wanted pastels
yeah that's like a little bit of Lou
green and then move it on my hand a
little bit of some why these colors
getting super excited I don't know why
it's okay
I'm so excited to go to the club tonight
oh my gosh okay so how many more colors
do we have left - four three - yeah -
pick two more color and do the pastel
yellow so I'm going to take the yellow
and do the same thing take a little bit
of the white so you can make it that
pastel color I think we got it right
we're going to do this coral shade right
here I've never been so focused to make
a move you look it is a serious Oh for
the bottom there's these little valves
that they need to set up the little
clouds I'm just going to do a little dot
honestly guys this has to be the easiest
costume out there right now it doesn't
have to be perfect
so that's what Boston does anybody can
do it and I feel like everybody gets it
oh yeah everyone's on snapchat simple
can't thank you already but I'm so happy
that we decided it to do pastel me too
but I think this is Dubai edgy smart
just totally like oh good biggest
Suttles - north - so now we are going to
do the little sparklies around it yeah
so I wear the sparklies I'm just gonna
use a white eyeliner I'm just gonna make
little crosses because it is all good
yeah there one Sparkle down 20 more
it'll be like a hundred
oh that's cute prickly dots all over
please the bottom
okay next so now I'm gonna make your
eyes bigger okay yeah don't poke me but
first we're going to go right over your
eyes already watering they're like
already preparing alright since I'm
super weirded out about that college
what am I supposed to do just line your
waterline okay and then you're going to
go a little bit underneath that okay
whew this is like super pigmented am i
doing it correctly yeah let me do it a
little bit more underneath you and with
a little bit of eye shadow flow some
boob they take a little bit of a bronze
Toby color and I'm going to put it right
underneath the white eyeliner kind of
redefines the look and also makes it
even bigger in bulgy bulgy r is perfect
word
we want the ice to really pop up yeah
just like the snapchat filter right hold
yeah gosh then I'm gonna put a little
bit of mascara on the lashes and I'm
gonna make the cheeks super bright pink
just like the filter and I'm going to
use this city color palette right here
and just taking the brightest Pinot Noir
mom took this home cute I think that's
not the perfect color - yeah not just so
well is it working yes and you're gonna
put it right on the apple of your cheek
bones
so this is the final look this is a cute
little puking rainbow and I think it's
really easy and if you're trying to get
a last-minute costume definitely do this
hello there I think it's so different
because we did pastel instead of what
the actual yeah rainbow color before
more days so Halloween my bit I've just
got anything around right you're not
already subscribed to heart subscribe
