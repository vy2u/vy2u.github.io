today I have this look for you guys
something very soft because you guys
requested it on Twitter I put up a poll
and you guys wanted to see something
like this so I decided to create
something like this just for you in case
you're you know having a first date
you're meeting the parents I'm innocent
or not really kind of look this is a
look or you want to see how to get this
look then keep watching don't forget to
subscribe to my channel and hit the
notification barrel so you can be a part
of a notification squad body's been
craving water so much I've been through
like six or seven bottles a day let's
get started with this tutorial um I
haven't primed my face or put
moisturizer on it so I'm just going to
do that really quick I'm going to use
this one from Estee Lauder's the clear
difference moisturizer looks like that
it's like a gel almost this one's good
for daytime - it's not heavy at all it's
very light so for primer today I'm going
to use the Milani Prime shield and it's
mattifying and who are minimizing so
when I have primers like this I'll just
push it into my skin so that it gets
into the pores and makes them look
flawless orchid in there that it really
set you don't want to put foundation
over primer and moisturizer when it's
wet okay so for your foundation today
I'm going to use the infallible Pro glow
24-hour foundation from L'Oreal this is
in the shade Sun beige she's gonna put
some on my hand and work my Beauty
Blender in there wow this is like the
perfect match for my skin tone I have to
blend it down to my neck yet and the
look that we're going for today is very
much first date like this isn't a full
coverage foundation I'm gonna go ahead
and work this all over my face so that
my skin looks even it almost feels like
it's water-based the very light feeling
on the skin usually I'll just go
straight into the eye shadow but for
this one I really want to focus on the
skin and make sure that the skin looks
really nice and not too cakey um but
just naturally pretty and fresh looking
so for that for the concealer I'm going
to take of course my one and only my
shape tape from Tarte I'm going to go
ahead and just put a few dots down
now I'm just going to blend all the dots
in now talking to you
since there's not going to be any noise
during this part I'm going to turn back
my song try my song back on
so I'm going to go ahead and do a little
bit of contouring now and I'm going to
take my Make Up For Ever Ultra HD and
505 this is like my go-to and it's not
like the perfect shade to contour with
because it does have like a oranjee
undertone so this is something that I
use as a bronzer slash contour stick so
it gives me some color in this area too
and it also kind of defines those spots
but I always go back over with a powder
like more of a ashy tone powder but I'm
going to take it right in here I kind of
like to curve it a little bit and I'll
stop it right before I get all the way
to the end just so that it looks more
natural looking and then I'll do a
little V right here and then I like to
cup it right underneath your like my
nose is a little pointy it's like a
little on the pointy side for me I see
it nobody else probably sees it but I do
so I like to focus the shadow right here
so that it stops it from continuing the
point you know so it just kind of blocks
it off so that looks a little bit more
rounded so I'm just going to go ahead
and blend that out now I really don't do
too much with contouring I don't bring
it up around my forehead all the time
blend it in with my Beauty Blender and
I'm using little short quick patting
motions and and then I'll bring it up
like I'll kind of fade it up into the
temple do you want it to blend really
nice so I'll just bring it up
I'm just gonna let my skin dry and set
so why like well it does that I'm going
to do my brows on camera this time I'm
going to go ahead and fill in my brows
I'm going to use the precisely my brow
pencil in number six what I like to do
first is define the shape underneath
when I fill in my brows I don't go in
one direction I kind of make these
little back and forth motions kind of
like you're like sketching your brows on
to the tail end like that so this is
basically the shape that I want and then
what I'll do is just go back and for
sketching them and building further
upwards as I go further up my hand gets
further and further away from my brow so
it's more of a softer touch turn the
spoolie this way and then I'll start to
brush the front of the brows out like
that I go ahead and take my benefit
cabral and this brush is actually really
good to use when you want to create
those hair like strokes in the front of
the brow so I what I do is start
creating these little tiny strokes like
that in the front what kind of look how
bald
I am create those little is tiny hairs
and then I gradually make them bigger as
I get closer to the brow and I go in the
direction that my brows brow hairs are
growing and then I'll just take this
brush right here is some morphe m-43 -
brush and I'll just clean up my brows
with a little bit of concealer and
that's pretty much it for my brows I'm
gonna go ahead and move on to my eye
shadow and it's going to be really
really easy that eyeshadow that I'm
doing today is very simple but very
pretty I'm going to take the Velvet 59
the exotic Lotus palette and I'm gonna
set my entire lid space and I always do
this just because I feel like there's a
lot of creams going on there there could
possibly be a ton of creasing going on
so I set my lids and I'm using this
cherry blossom shade right here my
morphe m-52 4 brush which is this I just
clean it I know it's having a bad hair
day and then start to pack it on to the
entire lid and then for the crease I'm
going to take Kyoto kimono and mix a
little bit of cherry blossom in it just
because I want it to be a very softer
version of Kyoto so I'm going to work
that into the crease like so I love this
brush where the crease is just so tiny
and cute if it's perfectly right in
there so precise so I'm going to go
ahead and take more of those two shadows
and blend it all the way into the crease
and i'm using windshield wiper motions
on the inner part of the crease when we
move outwards i do these circular
motions so that we can buff out the
color and kind of work it in really
seamlessly so just deepening that shade
up a little bit more so now i'm going to
go ahead and get to the fun part
it's excited the lid is going to be
super sparkly and pretty today so what
i'm going to be using is the liquid moon
dust eyeshadow from urban decay and this
is in the shade chemtrail so i'm gonna
go ahead and take this and pop it onto
the lid I don't want to have like a
harsh line right there so I'm just going
to use my finger pout it in and soften
it up I'm gonna let this dry I feel like
it has some patchy spots I know if it's
just me but it just looks a little
patchy but I think it's not gonna really
matter too much I think because I'm
going to go over with this shadow from
the balm it's called it's the overshadow
the sec spots and this is called work is
overrated okay so I'm going to take this
is a weave a 234 brush and I'm just
gonna dip my brow my brush in there it's
just a really pretty champagne like a
pink champagne glittery shade I take
that over the top and I think just
having that Urban Decay eye shadow on
the bottom is gonna really help it
adhere to the skin so we won't move
around so that's a good thing
I'm gonna go back into the crease and
I'm going to take more of the kyoto
kimono shade i'm going to deepen up the
outer part of the crease and I feel like
Mavi shades blush tones are so pretty
for Valentine's and I'm going to take
this highlight right here from Mac it's
like a pink iridescent looking high
I'm going to spray a little bit of this
tacha dewy skin mist on it pop it on to
the inner corners the mascara that I've
been loving is from the drugstore
Maybelline colossal bigshots
so good our goal for our lashes today is
super flirty flirty lashes so really
pack on the mascara okay I actually
forgot to curl my lash on that eye I'm
gonna go ahead and curl my lash on this
one that one's a little bit more
flirtier than the other one because I
forgot to curl the lash but we'll do it
after it dries for lashes today I'm
going to use the flutter lashes in Judy
looks like that so I'm going to take
these lashes I'm gonna pop them on
really quick and I'll be right back okay
so I'm going to go ahead and bake my
face I'm going to use this cover FX
translucent light perfecting setting
powder and this is going to help your
makeup from creasing underneath your
eyes I'm gonna let that just sit on my
face for a few minutes and while that is
doing that I'm gonna stare at my eye
shadow because I mean look at it it's so
pretty
and I'm going to go ahead and go back to
my lower lashline I'm going to take the
same Kyoto Como Kyoto kimono making it
my own words and start to work that on
the lower lash line I'm going to go
ahead and put on a bronzer and we use
this bronzer right here from the F rush
power with that on the cheekbone up into
the temple just to give our face some
color I also just brush this brush so it
looks like it's having a bad hair day
and this is basically what I would like
when my hair is washed so I can relate -
so I'm going to take this shade right
here I'm going to take that show gold up
it onto the cheekbone
a little bit on my Cupid's bow on top of
my nose and because we have so many
powders on our face I'm going to split
some of this taught to do skin mist on
my face so that we can make our skin
look like skin again so I'm just going
to take a couple cookies for their lips
I'm going to take the morphe liquid lip
in the shade virgin now I'm going to go
right over the top of it with quella
from Tarte it's like a glossy thank you
