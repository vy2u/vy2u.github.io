it's called I'm weird let's get it over
with so today I am taking off my fall
looks with a soft neutral fall makeup
tutorial just to get us in to the fall
vibes we're not jumping in all the way
it's like a little step into the fall
forest of mine and I thought that this
would be a great transition from my last
previous videos that are very full
coverage I decided just to give our
faces a little breather with this one
it's very much your skin but better and
I am not contouring in this video I am
trying out non touring it's a trend
that's been going around it's not using
anything to contour your face but
highlight what really helped me create
this non touring look is the makeup
forever step one primer to hydrate my
skin so that my attention waster Iser
that I use today from Laura Mercier will
sit on my skin nice and even and then
what really just tied the whole look
together and really popped out my
features in the hourglass luminizing the
ambient lighting palette this palette is
just so beautiful and I think that it
really pops out all of those features
without having to contour them so I am
going to show you guys how I nan toward
my face and I love this fresh glowy look
with this fall I shadow and I think
you're going to love it a lot and if you
decide to do this non boring look make
sure to tag me on Instagram I want to
see your looks
hashtag non touring hashtag trending at
Sephora so we could see your looks I
honestly feel like I have no makeup on
right now my lashes are so feathery and
light right now I can't even feel them
on my eyes it's a very comfortable
makeup look that I think everybody's
going to love and if you want to learn
how to get it then keep watching started
I'm going to put on this primer right
here this is the makeup forever step one
skin equalizer base hydrate if you have
a consistent dry face this is gonna help
hydrate your skin help smooth out your
skin and help the foundation last longer
I'm telling you without nail my hands
feel so free to do anything look how it
fits in every little area of my face
whoo recently I've been talking
out how I love full-coverage so much and
I have a lot of videos on full coverage
so I decided to switch it up a little
bit so I want to do a very lightweight
fresh looking skin today and I'm going
to be using the Laura Mercier tinted
moisturizer and it is in the shade sand
a little bit of coverage it's not going
to be too heavy this is basically going
to even out my skin tone this
moisturizer has SPF 20 to help protect
your skin from the crazy UV rays even
though it's fall
you still get a Sun it's so weird
especially well I live in California and
when you live here the Sun is still
beaming I feel like you don't really get
the fall season like everyone else does
it's just a really nice change to your
face when you can give it some air to
breathe in a shop here just bring it
down to my neck and I'm gonna stop
talking cuz I'm not sound like why did
eyes watch me I'm so weird
I try so hard outs are going to test
myself right now to see how many
products I can use without using contour
but still getting that same effect of a
contour now I'm going to cover my
under-eye circles and right up my face
just a little bit more I'm going to use
the Kat Von D lock-it concealer in m17
warm hide my panda eyes dry applicator
it looks like a little ironing board do
you see it it's like a little ironing
board now I have my concealer on it's
going to help bring out these areas make
them a little bit more brighter and I'm
going to start to bounce that on top of
the concealer so that it blends into my
skin brows NYX off-camera so on my
entire lid I'm gonna take double scoop
from the Too Faced totally cute palette
how cute is is this palette actually
came with a bunch of stickers and you
get to customize it and put on how some
many stickers as you want
and I just put more on the back because
there are so many stickers it was really
cute and finally I don't think I've ever
used this palette on my channel
I've surely used it a bunch Shirley
Shirley
Brenda and Shirley so I'm going to take
double scoop this shade right here and
I'm going to place it all over the lid
up to the brow bone this brush covers a
lot of space and since I want to cover
my entire lid with it I always look at
brushes are you stealing our brushes and
feel like what the heck am I going to
use this for how am I going to use it
but it's exactly what it's for is to
cover the entire lid space sometimes I
feel lost when I see these huge brushes
and then I realize actually I can use
this like then get those inner corners
because it tends to be really dark you
know if you dent your car and you pop it
out that's basically what you're doing
to your face you are popping out that
dent okay so now that our lid is even
I'm going to go ahead and jump into
bunny foo-foo which is the shade right
here and I'm going to put that all over
the lid up into the crease oh wait right
there before I go any further I'm gonna
take some tape just to make sure I have
like a really defined line and I don't
plan on easing eyeliner today so I'm
just gonna take some tape and put it
right here don't suggest use that much
tape I don't feel like I have to be so
careful this is gonna create that line
for me oh my eyes are so sensitive right
now and rode away hi I'm gonna take a
different palette because I was in
between the two palette and I decided to
go for a totally cute but I'm gonna pop
into the Too Faced natural matte palette
and I'm going to take honey butter and
this is going to help transition that
orangie Brown that we have if you use
that line and give it a little bit more
dimension and remember when we're
transitioning a shade we want to keep
our hand towards the back of the brush -
softly sweep over your crease you don't
want to put too much pressure in that
space and then I'm going to go into your
chocolate donut and I'm going to run
this across my lashline I'm close to the
lashes
I'm actually going to take honey butter
and I'm going to put it right on the
inner part of the inner corner of the
eyelid and then bring it all the way up
to the brow bone just to soften the look
up a little bit so now I'm going to take
the same bunny foo-foo shade and I'm
going to take it on the lower part of
the lash line it's going to use honey
butter to diffuse the line and soften it
up at the bottom for the bottom lash
line I'm going to take chocolate donut
and run it just halfway for the inner
waterline I'm going to take a nude liner
this is from Estee edit this is inside
trap urban nude shade and I'm going to
take that and I'm going to line my
waterline with it this shade is going to
open the eyes up and make it look very
awake and soft this is gonna look very
cool about it it's ovando isn't going to
make it look very open and soft and very
pretty so I'm going to go ahead and take
my little pinky and put it on my inner
corner I mean in my waterline I'm not
gonna lie to you guys every time I do my
inner waterline it's so hard for me to
do it so like I do a little ocean for
you guys like right now like this you
run across it that did nothing that was
just to show you guys now I'm gonna get
down and dirty into my mirror and get
like this clothes line my waterline I'm
going to go ahead and take my mascara
the mascara I'm taking is my favs I use
two mascaras that are coming current
faves one is for my upper lashes it's
the Marc Jacobs mascara for my bottom
lashes it's the makeup forever
excessive lash one or two coats so now
I'm going to go ahead and put on some
false lashes I'm going to do that off
camera I will be back with them so I
will see you in two seconds to set my
face I'm going to use the bare minerals
bare Pro powder and golden nude whenever
I do this I like to use a very light
patting motion and you always want to
set a cream with a powder is going to
look very much like your skin but better
I'm going to take a blush this is risk'
from Tarte and it's just a peachy nude
I'm going to put it right on the back of
the cheekbone and I'm not going to go
too far in with the blush because it's
just going to be a subtle soft wash of
color so I'm just going to use a little
bit behind the apples of the cheeks to
highlight I'm going to use this
hourglass highlighting palette right
here this is the ambient lighting
palette I'm going to take this shade
right here this is dim light this is
what's really going to bring out your
features without actually contouring so
this is very much the new non Touring
trend so we're not using any bronzer
we're not contouring we are just using a
highlight so I'm going to put the
highlight right on the tops of the
cheekbone and this palette is such a
beautiful soft glowing palate isn't
overwhelming it's just it gives you that
natural glowing from within love just
layering it on top of your cheekbone and
a little bit here how does it for the
face it's very glowing it's very natural
and just very much your skin but better
the lips we are going to do a berry
shade I'm feeling a berry vibes with
this so I'm going to go ahead and take
later Graham from Tarte and I'm just
going to start to outline my lips and
I'm going to over line at the Cupid's
bow I'm going to also over line right on
the outer edge then I'm going to start
to bring it inward and then for the lip
color I'm going to take TBT from Tarte
it's the TARDIS lippy this goes on so
soft and velvety okay so I am going to
take a little bit of Rage is this gray
tone shade or greyish purple just darken
it up a little bit more
