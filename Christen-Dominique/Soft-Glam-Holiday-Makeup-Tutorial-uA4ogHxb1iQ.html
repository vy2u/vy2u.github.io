welcome to my crazy messy hair day if
you are having a bad hair day all you
have to do is mess up your hair even
more so many compliments all day I
promise this video is not about my messy
pony this video is about this cool tone
pastel pink look and I'll be showing you
guys today
I have done a lot of warm looks on my
channel lately and I wanted to mix it up
a little bit I was inspired by this
palette which is so funny because it's
not an eyeshadow palette but I saw it
and I was like oh my god this is what I
want to do on my eyes this is actually a
cheek palette from NARS this is called
unfiltered - it has whole tone pinks in
it and I like that it has like mattes
and shimmers so you can use it on your
cheeks you can use it as a highlight and
they also have a warm tone palette this
is unfiltered one I used a highlight in
here and this on my cheek excuse my
little boy hands let me show you guys
how intense this is so I'm just going to
run it across just watching it on my
wrist like that that is the highlight
the blush and then I use these guys on
my eyes today and so so pretty very
pigmented very very pretty it's such a
multi-purpose palette you can highlight
with it you can add blush eyeshadow it's
you do so much with it if you want to
learn how to get this look then keep
watching this is good I've already
primed my face I'm going to go ahead and
go into some foundation I'm gonna be
using this one from la girl it's the pro
coverage HD foundation and I'm just
putting some on this little plate mixing
it with a lighter one just in case it's
a little too dark not the greatest smell
but it's okay I'm starting to like this
foundation this is from NARS it's the
light 275 Cannell I'm just going to work
that in underneath
by doing this triangle underneath your
eyes is going to make your eyes look
more lifted work that in with my beauty
blender I'm gonna do my brows off-camera
I will be right back okay so now for the
eyeshadow I'm going to take this NARS
palette right here the narcissist
palette this is actually a cheek palette
the unfiltered two palette there's this
really pretty pastel peach shade called
Conquest it's a matte blush but I feel
like it would work right all over the
lid just to set the eye and give the eye
like a really nice whole tone look so
I'm going to go in with my morphe r39
brush I also like to use one either
flesh tone shade or a shade like this
anything that you want to use as your
base I like to use that all over my lids
just so that we can set the creams on
the space because if you just go on top
of it with eyeshadow it can look a
little bit uneven the next I'm going to
take the morphe X Kathleen lights
palettes I'm going to go ahead and take
this shade right here and pop it onto
the lid and I'm just gonna do a light
wash of this color on the lid and then
for the crease color I'm going to take
this shade right here in the palette and
like a charcoal gray I'm just going to
use windshield wiper motions and I'm
actually loving the shades in this
palette so much so I'm going to go ahead
and take a power-play which is this
really pretty matte vivid pink I'm going
to go ahead and put that on my inner for
the inner part of my crease taking a
morphe m42 two brush and just going to
pack it on right
so I'm going to go ahead and pick up
that charcoal gray color and I'm going
to start to work that a little bit more
heavier on the outer part of the eye and
now I'm going to go ahead and take a
clean fluffy brush I'm going to take
this matte shade right here and start to
work that onto the brow bone then I have
this other morphe brush as the F 5:17 do
you see how that looks
that's not cute I'm going to take this
brush and I'm going to start to work
that shadow down and you can see as I'm
blending it into the darker shade it's
becoming this really nice soft gradient
look and I'm going to be using the
l'oreal voluminous Alenia or noir now
I'm going to put on some mascara and
just prep my eyelashes for false lashes
so I'm just going to put on some mascara
really quick and I will be right back
with some blush and then for a highlight
on this inner corner of the eyes I'm
going to take this shade from the Marc
Jacobs palette it's this one right here
it has like a purple reflect to it to
brighten up this inner area
and then on the bottom lashline i'm
gonna go ahead and take the charcoal
shade and start to work right on the
lower part of the outer lash line okay
so I have this really pretty pastel
purple shot of eyeliner from colour-pop
and it's called cry-baby and I'm going
to pop that on to the waterline I'm
going to set my face now I'm going to
use this pop Beauty setting 101 palette
and it has a chance loosen powder a
bandana and a peach I'm going to take
the translucent all over the face and
the banana underneath the eyes for the
all over the face I'm going to take this
morphe e41 brush and just pass that all
over just lightly patting it to set
everything in place and then for my
under eyes I'll take my Sigma powder
sweep brush and I'm going to pick up the
banana shade start to set my under eyes
with that so for bronzer I'm going to
take this rhodiola bronzer right here
and it's just a matte bronzer this is a
natural sunkissed glow and I'm just
going to sweep it on my cheeks this is
just going to give me some color and
then for my cheeks I'm going to use the
NARS narcissist unfiltered one palette
if I'm going to take this shade right
here it's called out there it's like a
deep rust matte color and I'm gonna use
that as blush on my cheeks and I'm going
to take my morphe five-30 brush work
that on the apples of my cheeks and I'm
going to focus it on the hairline
because that's where we want it to be
the darkest and then you want to lightly
fade it out to the apples I like the way
it looks when you bring it around the
temple not all the way up it just about
half way it gives you a really pretty
glow I'm gonna use this one as a
highlight this is watch me watch me is
like a opalescent gold Sheen color and
then I'm going to take my fan brush and
just work that on the tops of my
cheekbones
I like this highlight it's not
overpowering it's just a nice natural
glow to the skin I really like it and it
meshes well with that warm
I'm going to go in with this pinky beige
a lipliner from NYX it's called soft
pink and I'm going to work that on the
lip line and for some reason I have been
loving to accentuate and overdo my
Cupid's bow over that I'm going to take
the colour-pop ultra matte lip in knotty
and then over that I'm going to put on
this colour-pop ultra glossy lip and
it's in nonsense it's a sheer gloss kind
of using it as a highlight I'll keep
everything else matte just like the
little highlighted area and that is the
final look thank you guys for watching I
