launched right now today oh my god I
can't believe we're live right now at
this very moment this is my second this
is for my second look from the lemonade
collection and I am doing this super
glam peachy smokey kind of look the star
of the show in this palette is peach
it's all over my face
as a highlight it's all over my eyes my
lids my inner corners everywhere on my
face my nose my lip cheekbones
everything and then I set my entire face
with new tea on my under eyes it's
actually perfect for the under eyes
without making it too bright you know so
this is a beautiful beautiful color if
you're my skin tone to set those under
eyes and basically everywhere else on my
face and I also used the peach tea gloss
and I'm gonna have swatches of all of
the glasses for you guys in the end of
this video but this is basically a
little preview of peach tea swatched on
the hand I have it on my lips I don't
have any kind of liner on my lips
because I wanted that natural kind of
glossy wet lip kind of look but you will
see full swatches in this video and I
have pricing on bundles for the glosses
where the collection itself down below
so if you want to check that out look in
the description box I hope you guys go
out and drench yourself and lemonade
from the face to the lips everything I
cannot wait to see your looks if you do

hashtag Dominique cosmetics so we can
check it out and post you guys but if
you want to get into this video right
here to do second look from the lemonade
collection super glowy do you see the
peach on my cheekbone
it is poppin it is beautiful and it's
going to be your summer highlight this
year so if you want to see how I got
this look then don't forget to subscribe
to my channel and hit that notification
bell so you can be a part of the quad
family and without further ado let's get
into this video face I'm going to use
thee for solid rose gold elixir drops
they're so pretty
I just love dropping them on my face I
want a some extra coverage on my face
today so for this look I'm gonna use the
easy way essential high coverage
foundation in the shade almond
alright so my skin looks
even now so I'm gonna jump into the eyes
so I'm using a brand new lemonade
palette I got this from my PR package
right here that I sent to myself can we
just take a moment to look at the inside
of this look how gorgeous that is so the
first color I'm gonna pick up is new tee
I'm gonna take it on this huge fluffy
brush right here from Mac it's a 240s
brush you see how it's really shiny
because I just put foundation there so
I'm just gonna mattify the entire eye on
both sides so now I shadow will apply
evenly on the lid instead of getting
stuck in little greasy looking spots
take sweet tea which is this vibrant
orange right here you want to be careful
and how much you pick up of this shade
cuz it is very very vibrant it's gonna
wash it into the crease I'm just doing
these back and forth motions and some
circle motions use whatever emotion you
feel is right for blending your
eyeshadows out and I'm gonna angle this
upwards so that it lifts our eye without
having to do a crazy thick wing but I do
want to do a wing in this video just
because I haven't done one in a while
and I'm missing my wings but I do want
to lift my eyeshadow up just in case you
don't want to use a wing you can always
play with your eye shadow so that it
lifts your eyes especially we're feeling
tired if your eyes are looking a little
saggy a little sad saggy but then go
ahead and angle your eyeshadow upwards
because that's always gonna make your
eyes look more awake younger lifted and
just ready for the day I'm also gonna
create a wing on my eye so it's really
gonna look nice and lifted I'm gonna
take a smaller more densely packed brush
so we can really pack in a color so for
that I'm gonna take this Sigma exact
blend the e30 to go back into the same
color and just start to layer it right
onto the crease we watch the first layer
of sweetie on and now we're gonna go
back in with the second layer
but we are gonna work this precisely in
the crease flick this upward so we can
fade up into the brow but we still get
that really nice punch of sweet tea on
our crease and then with this tiny
little baby brush from BH Cosmetics it's
from my it's my ray-ray collection it's
the number seven brush I'm gonna take it
and dip it into chai tea I'm gonna work
that in a
right on the outer corners of the eye I
want to make sure that this stays under
the orange I don't want it to go above I
just want to make this a little bit more
dramatic on the very outer corner of the
eye and then for the brow bone I'm gonna
take new T so we can carve out the brow
and just kind of blend out this sweet
pea shade a little further down and then
for the lid I'm gonna use peach this is
one of those everyday colors that you
can use all the time looks so nice it's
kind of a neutral pop of color it's
something you can incorporate into your
look every single day so I really love
this color I'm gonna take the makeup
shot t51 brush and pop into there this
shade is super reflective but neutral
like it's not scary to put all over your
eye if you're not used to color but at
the same time it's just in especially if
you like those bronze he kind of looks
this is so beautiful it's it's a
beautiful peach color and then it has
these little tiny micro flecks of gold
gorgeous I'm actually going to take that
same peach and I'm gonna bring it in all
the way to the inner corner I'm gonna
take it on the lower part of the tear
duct I'm gonna take sweet tea I'm gonna
bring it all the way down to the lower
lash line so I'm just gonna pick up this
tiny little brush and work that on the
lower lash line
this look is all about sweet tea and
peach I kind of want to use peach as a
highlight today because I want that to
light my entire face so I'm gonna use
that a little bit later and I just
really miss having that elongated cat
shape eyes so we're gonna bust out our
winged liner today's take my bomb
Schwing black liner right here
For Lashes I'm gonna take the list
Selene lashes in the style Celeste these
are super super fluffy fluffy fluffy
lashes so I'm gonna put them on really
quick for you guys these lashes are
everything I've never tried them and
I've always thought that they're a
little too crazy and on my eyes honestly
I can feel the top of the lashes
touching my brows but it's okay this is
like goals I love it it's like a messy
fluffy crazy eyelash extension situation
happening but I kinda love it that's
what it looks like so now I'm going to
just put on some mascara so that we can
mesh my real and false lashes together
and then we are going to put a ton on
the lower lashes so that they can look
fluffy too probably not as fluffy but
you know the same family do this mascara
is not bad this is from butter LONDON
it's called the oh my how hi lengthening
mascara it kind of adds fullness to the
lashes lengthens and separates I love it
okay so now I'm gonna move on to the
rest of the face so I'm gonna do some
concealer use shade 5 from the k'kaw
concealer range and we're just gonna go
right underneath I think going this way
lately creating like this little table
top instead of the V still go down the
center of the nose kind of crooked but
it's okay we can blend it out still do
this like we normally do for ready for
war I'm gonna take this tiny little
Beauty Blender is probably shoulda gave
this to Jaden to use for my under eyes
going in like this like this little
tabletop is something new I've been
doing and I've been really liking it
because it doesn't mess up my under I
think and it also gets the corners of my
nose so they look it looks a little bit
more slim to set my under eyes I'm gonna
go in with this new tee right here you
guys it is always super important for me
to have something for my under eyes so
far these two pallets just because my
under eyes are like an essential for my
face to look on point it's a warm peach
color so it's gonna neutralize my type
of skin tone and dry so if you're
similar to my color then it'll do the
same for you
but if not you can always find so many
more uses out of this nude matte kind of
color I'm gonna go right in here and
down the nose first in a set our whole
face I don't like setting my entire face
I only do this part right here and then
I let the other part just kind of like
do whatever it wants to do I still put
on bronzer and stuff so it does set in
some way but not all of it and
especially when you used to be covering
up your skin using full coverage Joy's
nice to leave natural skin peeking
through different parts of your face
because then you won't look as kicky so
I just set everything on my face with
new tea and then for contouring I'm
seeing you do that really quick I'm
gonna use the same powder contour I
always use it's my favorite the Kat Von
D shade and light palette I will be back
with a very contoured alien-like base
hopefully so now that I'm all contour we
are going to highlight the actual ear in
a bronze we're gonna bronze a face with
a bronzer I'm gonna use the Patrick
Starr give me life
bronzing powder like so I'm just gonna
give my face some color all right so
we're nice and bronzed now I'm gonna
highlight for the highlight I'm gonna
pick up peach in the lemonade palette so
I'm just gonna take peach like so we're
gonna highlight with it for the first
time ever I just feel like this would be
a really pretty highlight and it is it
is a very very pretty highlight and it's
like crazy intense either which is cool
but I know for sure you can build this
up and see how it's getting more intense
okay well you can go from
subtle soft little beep to blind your
eyes need some sunglasses this is such a
pretty summer highlight actually I set
my undereyes s my entire face I
highlighted with this palette I did my
eye shadow it's always a multi-purpose
now we're on choose a lip something is
itching my nose I'm just gonna pretend
like I don't feel anything on my nose
I'm gonna show you a swatch of the lip
glosses because in my last video I did a
swatch but my camera turned off and
totally lost the footage and I do a
swatch in this video so you guys can see
so I'm gonna swatch a sweet tea which
are the perfect for this eyeshadow look
but we actually use sweet tea in the
last look i did so i think i'm gonna use
peach tea these are pretty this is sweet
tea right here it can go from sheer to a
soft medium it wasn't formulated to be
super opaque when i formulated these I
wanted them to be just a glossy topper
but they definitely can be a little bit
of a medium coverage and they smell like
vanilla cupcakes and this will help me
really figure out which color I want to
use on my lips to the next color we have
is strawberry lemonade looks like so and
this next one is peach tea which I think
I'm gonna end up using for this look and
the last one is pink lemonade which is a
really nice cool tone pink this reminds
me of baby spice it just gives me baby
spice vibes for this look though I think
I'm gonna do peach tea I kind of just
want to use it on my natural lip so you
guys can see what it looks like
everybody has a different lip
pigmentation so it's gonna look a little
different on every skin tone
and lip pigment just a little bit of
highlight on the mustache and a glossy
lip yep that summer my lips are kind of
dry so I can keep layering this lip
gloss on and it's just gonna make the
feel so incredibly soft like right now I
had little rough patches on my lips it's
gone completely all your rough edges on
your lips are gone believe me try it out
and this softness that you immediately
feel when you put the gloss on your lips
is going to last all day even if you
wipe off the gloss and that crazy it's
amazing I love these glosses and
this color combo so that is our
completed look I hope you guys enjoyed
the video thank you guys for watching I
hope you enjoyed this video the second
look of the lemonade collection it was
so fun to do I'm absolutely obsessed
with peach I have to say that I love all
the colors the peach is something that I
get really excited about because it
looks so good on almost every skin tone
and you can use it all over your face
and this is one of my top favorites in
the entire palette love love love it I
