song hey guys welcome back to my channel
since today I'm gonna be showing you how
to do this look right here very easy
simple and I like the colors that I use
today because they look good on every
skin tone rose gold
pinky golden peachy undertones still
pretty and fresh for spring I decided to
do a colorful winged liner today too
but I did for a shadow instead of actual
liner because I didn't want it to weigh
down the look I really liked it I hope

to get this look then keep watching it
just comes out its natural we learn to
love it embrace the inner cruise boat
boys so I'm going to start off with
moisturizing my skin the first thing I'm
going to use is this little cutie right
here it's from this month's if sea glam
bag I'm actually partnering with Ipsy to
use some of the stuff in the glam bag in
my video today so if you see other
little cuties like this it's probably
from the glam bag I'm gonna try this guy
right here this is air repair complexion
boosting moisturizer so we are going to
pop that on to our face to give us a
nice boost of moisture so I'm gonna put
some of this on squeezing the little
life out of it it's supposed to help
with dry skin dehydrated skin ensued out
your skin feels really good smells kind
of smells like a really pretty plant
that I don't really know the name of I
like to put a light base of foundation
on just before I do anything else I like
to work with my eyes first but when I'm
filming I like to put a light base of
foundation so it's just a little bit
easier to look at you know just say and
then take my Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
foundation and why three through five
in case you guys are wondering this
little brush right here is from it
cosmetics and I use this from time to
time but it I feel like it doesn't like
it's a good brush but I feel like it
needs little streaky marks on my face so
I end up using my Beauty Blender to
smooth it out and that is a very far for
me right now so oh my god I had my
sponge right here I had both sponges
this is the 3d Sigma Beauty sponge I've
been using lately and I like it I like
it very much so I just kind of like
smooth everything out with this little
guy okay so now we have foundation on
I'm going to quickly put my brows on
I've been using this L'Oreal one I used
it today actually it's in dark brunette
it's their stylist definer brow thing
I'm actually going over it with the
benefit brows was it a brow give it that
a little bit of a warmer look it was a
little bit too cool tone for me I'm
gonna actually use lid primer today I
know I never use lip primer I always use
a concealer I'm gonna go ahead and use
this one this is from Smashbox that's
their photo photo finish lid primer in
light and I'm gonna pop that onto my lid
then I'm just going to blend everything
out with a beauty sponge alright so now
we have a clean smooth nice even canvas
to work on I'm going to go ahead and
pick up a new palette that I haven't
used that just came out and it's so so
pretty and natural-looking
it's the Too Faced and natural love
palette I think it's so gorge
I'm going to pick up nudie I'm going to
pop that into my crease first which
crease brush are we using today mini is
this Luxy 229 brush grab nudie and then
I'm going to just work that back and
forth into my crease make sure you don't
have too much product on your brush so
it's not like oh you know work this in
circular motions in to the crease I'm
actually gonna extend it a little
further out like right about here we are
going to be putting a different color on
top of this so you do want to kind of
use this
Kri shade a little bit higher up so the
reason why we're using this is so that
we can have a nice gradient effect so
I'm going to take it a little bit higher
up than what you know the usual crease
like right about here I'm going to take
it up a little further up like right in
here and I'm going to go back and forth
in circular motions and then of course
right into the crease I'm just going to
use these back and forth motions so now
that we have that very neutral crease
shade on there I'm going to go ahead and
pop in makeup and chill makeup and chill
is this really nice Brown it's actually
the darkest Brown in the palette I'm
going to go ahead and take that it's a
matte shade I'm going to take the same
brush and I'm just going to start to
work that layering it right underneath
the first crease shade and I say
underneath because I still want that
shot that topi shadow to peek through
and help with that gradient and
dimension and so we're going to keep
this right below this is the Sigma
tapered blending the e-40 I'm going to
go ahead and blend the edges of this
keeping my hand towards the back of the
brush so I have more control over the
blend so the next color I'm going to use
is this one right here this is the deuce
a free Matic eyeshadow in the shade
I wanted to use that on the crease it's
a little shimmery but it's like super
highly pigmented and very blendable so I
really enjoyed playing with this before
I did this look when I put her right
into the crease and really bring it in
make sure to blend it out like out
further towards the tail end of the brow
I am trying my best to leave the lid
open because I want to put a really
pretty pink color in there from the Too
Faced palette so I'm just going to leave
that as open as possible so for the lid
color I'm going to take bunny nose which
is this really pretty pink right here
and just work that into the lid I'm
going to use this eye shadow brush right
here from Vasanti it's called the
professional contour eye shadow brush
I'm going to work this on the outer lid
just to blend out the harsh edge it has
those dome shaped bristles so it's
perfect for blending in the crease
little inner and outer corners so I'm
just going to take that and blend that
harsh edge out like so the bristles are
really soft this is a really good crease
brush actually I am going to keep that I
also want to create a line right here
with this shadow so I'm going to wet
this winged liner brush this is the
Sigma eo6
wet it up and then I'm going to dip my
brush into this shadow right here
so as you can wet it too so let's see
how it works as a liner it's pretty it
gives you like a rose gold kind of look
which is really pretty for spring create
a little wing like that that's actually
really really pretty I like it a lot so
I'm gonna put some mascara on now I use
my Maybelline colossal Big Shot put my
lashes before I put on some false lashes
I'm going to be using these velour
lashes in the style see-through they
look like this for the lower lash line
I'm going to take this over Cosmetics
peach blush and I'm going to use it as
an eye shadow I feel like you can use it
as a highlight and eyeshadow it's just
really pretty peachy pink golden
undertones it's gorgeous so I'm going to
go ahead and pop that on the lower lash
line with a wet angled liner brush and I
just wet it by spritzing some fix+ on it
I know it looks a little crazy right now
because I don't have concealer on but I
will do that in just a minute for my
under eyes I'm going to take this city
color photo chic dark spot corrector
it's going to just brighten up any dark
spots on your face and so I'm going to
take it it has like a peachy undertone
so I feel like it's good as a color
corrector for me too so I'm going to use
my concealer brush and just work it in
there and this is just going to really
help to neutralize the dark spots on
your face or for me underneath my eyes
and I'm just going to work it right
underneath there wow that really
actually really like how that covered up
my under eyes so now I'm just going to
put on some mascara on my bottom lashes
so we're done with the eyes I'm going to
go ahead and move on to the rest of the
face I'm going to contour first I feel
like we need to contour so I'm going to
take my
where is it I'm going to use my I use
the same thing all the time I love this
thing so so much but I'm changing up my
brush I'm using the Smith 220 brush to
contour and of course the Y 505 from
Make Up For Ever I'm just going to
hollow out my cheekbones a little bit
more
I've been liking liquid blush lately
more so than the powdery blush because I
just I'm kind of steering away from too
many powders on my face I'm gonna take
orgasm this is the liquid blush from
Mars worth that on my cheeks it's a
really pretty pink shade and a little
bit goes a long way with this it blends
into the skin so nicely and it just
melts into your skin for this springtime
I really like my face to look moisturize
and just really glowing and healthy so I
opted for more creams than powders but I
do want to set my face in place so
nothing moves around but before I do
that I'm going to spritz some of this
Mac prep and prime it's this fix plus
writes that all over my face let that
sit to set my creams in place I'm going
to take this cover FX translucent powder
okay I'm gonna just dust this all over
my skin just so that everything is in
place it's not going to give us any more
coverage but it's going to make sure
that our creams don't go anywhere slip
and slide off of our face I use a little
bit of bronzer behind the apples of the
cheeks and around the temple and the
bronze are amazing is this one right
here it's the Victoria Beckham Estee
Lauder bronzer and I'm just taking it
across the temples and right behind the
cheekbone so for the highlight I'm going
to take the Too Faced Lovelight
prismatic highlighter and this is in the
shade blinded by the light and I'm gonna
pop that on my cheeks so now we're
moving on to the lips I'm going to take
this matte dervish lip liner and I'm
going to line my lips with it sometimes
I'll use this lip liner and not even
wear anything else with it and I'll just
put it all over my lips and it gives it
just a really natural pretty flush of
color on the lips I'm going to take the
Tarte cosmetics TARDIS quick dry matte
lip paint and this is in the shade Rose
Day I'm going to use that all over the
lips this lip paint is very full
coverage and it dries really quick when
I do a matte lip I usually like to go in
the center with a gloss so today I'm
going to be using this little guy right
here it's another little cutie and this
is from be a bombshell cosmetics and
it's a lip gloss and the shade possess'd
it's a really pretty nude 18 color and I
like to use something that has a higher
Shyne and this one is supposed to have
that high shine so it works perfect for
the center of the lips just to give us
that pouty boost in our lips this is a
really pretty combo I like the combo
with the eyes it just all ties in
together beautifully I really like it I
feel like it's very fresh and perfect
for springtime and that's pretty much
the look this is the final look you guys
