today I'm gonna be doing this vampy look
it's all about the flirty lashes and the
bold lip for the fall I think I've told
you that I was gonna do a ton of these
fall looks they're my favorite my nails
match my nails are so fall but yeah this
is the look I hope you guys enjoy it and
if you want to learn how to get it then
keep watching so the first thing I'm
going to do is prime my eyes I'm going
to be using a concealer for this
personally I think using a concealer is
best because it's a lot more creamy and
gentle on the eyelids and it blends
really easy and it doesn't really tug
too much at this area and it's very
sensitive so that's just a personal
thing and then I'm gonna go in with the
makeup geek eyeshadow and cupcake and
just wash it on to the outer V area and
actually I'm supposed to do this second
but you know what there's no real rules
to this makeup stuff though so we're
gonna I'm gonna pick up this one from
the chocolate bar palette and I think
this one's coconut right here and I'm
taking my flat shader brush from zoeva
I'm gonna pack that on to the lid and
I'm gonna keep packing this on until
it's a nice vibrant new lid and I'm also
gonna take it really high up into the
inner corners I kind of have a dark I
think most people do have this like a
darker area really close to their nose
and inner corner of the eye so I'm gonna
shake it really high up in there so it's
nice and bright and then go back in with
cupcake and wash it around at the outer
V again now I'm going to apply Barcelona
Beach on the crease so let's do this
so now I'm gonna start working on the
crease area and I'm gonna mostly focus
this on the lower part of the crease
because I want to have this sort of
softly defined semi matte cut crease
effect so carve out your crease but you
want to blend the edges very soft so I'm
gonna go ahead and do that I'm also
gonna take it into the lid area kind of
creating this nice soft cat eye effect
but with your shadows and you're gonna
notice something the layer shadow after
shadow on this and then blend out as I
go so I'm gonna be doing this back and
forth
now I'm taking max black berry I'm gonna
layer it right on top of that Barcelona
Beach color
and I'm gonna do the same thing
intensify it as much as I want and then
blend out the edges with my fluffy brush
I'm gonna continue blending blackberry
down into the outer parts of the lower
lash line as well and so far it looks
like so and then I'm gonna go in with or
less which is this beautiful cranberry
color from makeup geek and that's gonna
bring that autumn warm fall leaves kind
of vibe to it kind of holiday feel to
make it more 3-dimensional I'm gonna add
the black and layer it on there this is
totally optional if you want more soft
you can leave how it is and then I'm
gonna go in with my Kat Von D tattoo
liner and make just a small wing and I
can already tell that this is gonna be
one of my favorite fall looks just
because it's so wearable and soft and
really accentuates your natural contours
and this is what it looks like so far
it's all about the lashes and lips with
this look so I'm gonna take my velour
lashes here in not sure of I'll link it
in the description box below but they
look like this you're so nice because
lately I've been kind of impatient with
my lashes I already cut the sides and
then I'm gonna put on the glue into the
strip and then after I do that I let it
sit and I do the other lash just so time
goes by a little bit faster so I'm gonna
let that dry it only takes 20 seconds so
it'll be tacky enough by the time we're
done with her other eyelash I like to
just set them down in the center and
attach one side at a time
I also added a second pair of lashes I
don't remember what exactly the style is
so I'll have it linked below for you
guys so now I'm just gonna mesh the real
lash with a false one so I'm apply some
mascara and then take some tweezers just
to clamp them down together so it looks
nice and even and then I'm gonna take
some more mascara and apply some to the
lower lashes as well you want your
lashes to be as dark and flirtatious as
possible with this look and then I'm
gonna take some of my Too Faced Born
This Way Foundation mixed it with my LC
foundation just because it makes my skin
look extra fleet if you may it makes my
complexion look really like hydrated and
flawless so I really love these two
foundations together
and I'm gonna take some concealer this
is the Urban Decay Naked concealer my
all-time favorite concealer right now
it's actually been my favorite concealer
for a while now so um if you guys don't
have it you probably want to get this
one because it's great as a brightener
as well so I'm gonna apply that to the
highlight points of my face as well as
to cover the under eye circles so now
I'm gonna add a layer of extra coverage
and also set my foundation in place so
it doesn't slide so I'm using the urban
decay powder foundation to do that and
then I'm going over my under eyes to
brighten them up with the manic Adar
powder in c3 I also love the situ so you
can either one of those will brighten
your under eyes so good and then to make
my nose look a little bit thinner I take
the bright powder right along the sides
of the nose so it's less contouring less
mess in case you're not so great at
contouring and then I'm gonna go in with
the bronzer from Smashbox and bronze
light just to add some definition to my
face or the blush I'm using this one
right here it's a warm neutral color
it's called aunt earth it's from the
energy nor a fall edition palette with
Tarte and I'm just gonna apply it to the
cheekbones and sweep it back into the
hairline so it looks very natural whoo
this is my favorite part the lips and
this is a lipstick from Marc Jacobs it's
called miss Scarlett I'm gonna apply
this one and then I'm gonna layer the
honest Asya matte liquid lipstick in
potion it's a deep purple which is
really beautiful but together it creates
this really nice vampy bold lip and I'm
just gonna go back and forth and layer
them together until I create the shade
that I like now I'm going to add a
highlight this is the Becca champagne
pop highlight and it has like a peachy
undertone so it works perfect for this
fall look and now that we have it on
their cheekbones in our nose we look
extra freaky and we're ready for the
Fall
