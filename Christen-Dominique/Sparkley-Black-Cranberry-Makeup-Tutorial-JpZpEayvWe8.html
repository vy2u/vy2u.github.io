hi everyone welcome back to my channel
so today I'm going to be doing this
black sparkly smokey eye with a little
bit of cranberry on the crease this is
really good for New Year's especially if
you're wanting to look super glam I will
be doing a different New Year's look so
if you want to learn how to get this
look then keep I'm going to start off
with my eyes first but I'm going to
cover up my skin a little bit with this
BB primer from Tarte and I'm just going
to do this so that you're not looking at
all of my redness and big huge blemishes
that I've been getting lately so I'm
just going to fit that all over my face
helps to smooth out your skin the
texture of your skin so that's why I
like using this one I'll sometimes even
use it by itself and I was a little bit
more tan when I got this so it looks a
little bit darker that's okay because
you know we're wearing a turtleneck in
our ears
um okay so now I'm going to go ahead and
start on my eyes I'm going to do
something really dramatic this is going
to be perfect for like New Year's or any
holiday crazy holiday parties or gloves
are going to it's going to be super
dramatic very sparkly and I'm really
excited to get to do it for you guys but
what I'm going to be doing first is I'm
actually going to be using a primer
which I never do I'm going to use this
cap on D primer right here prime eyelids
is it's also kind of like a corrector so
it hides the redness on discoloration on
your eyelids so you can take it down a
little bit lower as well
hi hello good morning this is where the
voiceover kicks in I am now gonna do my
eyes so I'm taking this kat von d
palette so the shade light palette and
slick the reddish brown shade in the
palette this is going to be our
transition color we're going to put it
in the crease and on the lower lash line
too
we're just going to wash it in you can
make it as intense as you'd like so I
went back into that and I kind of
deepened the crease a little bit more
but again this is just our first
transition shade so it doesn't have to
be intense this is a beautiful shade I
love this color this is from Make Up For
Ever this is their this is actually a
blush and it's in m84 6 I'm going to use
it as eyeshadow today I'm going to focus
it right on the crease using a flat
shader brush and I'm also going to go on
the lower lash line very close
to the to the lashline and I'm just
gonna work it there and I'm not gonna
avoid the lid with this shade right here
I'm gonna totally avoid the lid don't
get it anywhere near the lid part
because we're going to be putting a
different color there so after I have
the intensity that I want I'm gonna
blend the edges out with a bronzer so
I'm taking a fluffy brush just to blend
out the edges of this shadow so that it
has like a nice glow and transition from
the brow bone to the crease so now I
want to deepen the intensity of the
crease so I'm going to go back in with a
flat shader brush in that red shade and
I focus it right on the crease and right
very close to the lower lash line and
then on the clean side of the brush I
flick it upwards towards the brow bone
and then now I'm taking a very pointed
blending brush just to focus on blending
the edges of that I took that eye shadow
up a little too high more than what I
actually like so I took a concealer in a
little concealer brush just to work it
into the brow bone and it's going to
really make that brow bone pop for the
lid I'm going to take this shade from
colour-pop called frisky and it's very
buttery and creamy like all the color
pop shadows it's beautiful and I'm
applying it with my finger at first but
then I realized this could get really
messy so I used two pointed concealer
brush to blend it on my lid and then to
blend the edges and really make them
soft
I used my finger and I feel like that
was the best method to do that at this
point I'm like okay I look like a
vampire I went ahead and took that red
shade and I deepened the outer crease
because I think that looks gorgeous on
top of the black and then I blended out
the edges with a blending brush now I'm
making a cat liner so I'm using my
makeup forever ink liner to do that
now for the fun part the glitter I'm
taking after-hours from violet boss and
applying it to the lid this is the
violet boss leather glue so I'm applying
that first and then I'm going over and
dabbing on the glitter right on top of
it I looked on their website after hours
it's unavailable now it was a limited
edition but they do have midnight fire
work which is just the same as that but
instead of the purple glitter flecks in
it it has red either way it's going to
look beautiful any black glitter you
could use really for the waterline I'm
using the Urban Decay zero pencil and
then I'm taking a concealer brush the
concealer brush we used earlier to apply
the lid shade I'm smudging it out with
that I'm applying a little bit of
mascara and now it's time for the lashes
I'm going to put on these lashes right
here these are from violet Voss they're
called BAM Tris let me show you real
close so you can see the style really
really nice and spiking to pop them onto
the center and attach one side at a time
I'm gonna go ahead and apply some
mascara and then use tweezers to mesh
the real and false lash together for the
foundation I'm using the smashbox
camera-ready beauty water and this is in
light/medium honestly i didn't think it
would have that much coverage just
because it had water in the name but
it's really nice coverage and it looks
very it doesn't look cakey or drawing it
looks really really nice on the skin
alone by itself just like right here i
could stop here but i need to brighten
my under eyes so I'm using my ultimate
favorite concealer in the entire world
which is The Naked skin from Urban Decay
and I'm using that also on the
highlighted points of my face as a base
for my highlight and then to work it
into my skin I'm using my warmer ring
finger and I feel like this is the best
saying even better than the Beauty
Blender when it comes to your concealer
for my contour i'm using this tarte
contouring stick this is a very light
shade right here so they have darker
ones but I decided to use a lighter
shade for some reason right here it
actually it works really well
either way it's like a really nice base
if you're using a lighter one it just
kind of marks the areas where you want
to have definition and then I'm just
blending in the contour with my finger
and here I'm using the dome-shaped
synthetic brush from Tarte to blend it
into my next lock down the foundation
and concealer so it doesn't move I'm
using the Kat Von D powder and this
makes your skin look super flawless by
the way and then I'm going to go ahead
and take the contour palette from Tarte
the Tarte East and I'm going to take the
darkest shades and go right over the
contour areas that I marked out and I'm
just intensifying those areas making
them more defined and really contouring
that jaw line and then with the yellow
banana powder I'm going to highlight the
under eyes and also go where the
highlighted areas are like the bridge of
the nose in the middle of the forehead
also the chin I'm going to take this
gorgeous sparkly palette right here it's
called bling it on it's the Amazonian
clay blush palette taking that setter
shade prim and I'm going to pop it on to
my cheekbones and now for the lips I'm
going to take the violet vos matte
liquid lipstick in Slade it's a neutral
nude I love this shade but it's a little
too nude for the look I was going for so
I grabbed this Mally lip gloss in sweet
peach just to add a little bit of color
to the center and this is the final look
