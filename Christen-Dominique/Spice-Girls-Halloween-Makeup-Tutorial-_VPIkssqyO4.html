important thing for us is to stay happy
within ourselves and to put a smile on
other people's faces and if we can do
that
you gotta get with a friend if you wanna
be my lover you gotta get with my
friends make it last forever friendship
never
everyone I'm baby spice and we are back
to my channel so today I have my friends
with me and we are becoming the spice
now if you want to learn how to get baby
spices look keep watching and if you
want to see all my other friends and
make sure to go check out their channels
I'll link up in the description below
and if you want to see how to get this
look then keep watching
so I'm going to prep my skin prime it
and to do that I'm going to use my
natural olive cream light formula from
Jaya and I got this from my Ipsy glam
bag I'm partnering up with FC to do this
FC glam bag video and I'm going to go
ahead and prep my face with the
moisturizer I'm going to go ahead and
put on some foundation this one is from
Make Up For Ever it's the Ultra HD
foundation which is really really good
I'm going to use my Beauty Blender to
apply it to my face
and then for the concealer I'm going to
be using the nude sticks concealer
pencil in light - to just cover up those
under eyes hand eyes - just make a
little triangle underneath my eye and
then down the center of the nose
Cupid's bow and right on the chin
so baby spice always had a fresh dewy
kind of look to her so I'm going to go
ahead and put on this a Becca backlight
filter and it's going to be the base to
our highlight so it's just going to
brighten up these areas a little bit
more right on the top of the cheekbone
the bridge of the nose and other for the
truth Bowl I'm going to contour with the
anastasia shadow stick foundation and
i'm just going to contour the nose a
little bit on the sides and then right
underneath the cheekbone
I like this contour stick because it
creates more of a shadow rather than
like a oranjee bronzy look and you want
to create those natural shadows when
you're contouring this one it shows a
lot the cheekbones a little bit and then
for my brows I'm just gonna fill them in
using my makeup forever eyebrow palette
and I do that off-camera really quick
and I'll be right back okay so now I'm
going to move on to the eyes I'm going
to be using this palette right here this
is the urban decay naked smoky palette
and I'm going to go ahead and use 13th
first I want to put that all over my
eyelid and to do that I'm using a zoeva
234 luxe smokey brush and I'm going to
pop it onto the entire lid and then I'm
going to take combust right here for the
crease what and I would do my face with
today I'm going to be using the morphe 5
1 4 brush and just add some soft
definition in there her makeup was super
fresh
glowy nothing too dramatic I think
wanted to keep her baby spice image
separate from all the other ones so they
went pretty light on the makeup I'm just
doing windshield wiper motions back and
forth and just softly blending it
upwards towards the brow bone I'm going
to go ahead and pop combust on the lower
part of my lash line and use my morphe M
5:07 brush smaller brush right here and
using that same shade just to run it
across the lower lash line
so I'm going to take this little cute
pallet from a vintage by Jessica Lovaas
skin taking this shade right here and
I'm going to pop that into the inner
corners and a little bit onto the inner
part of the lash the lid I always saw
baby spice with a blue eyeshadow which I
wasn't a fan I wasn't a fan of the blue
eyeshadow but I'm gonna take a different
take on that I'm going to take a
different take I'm going to twist it a
little bit I'm going to use a blue
eyeliner today I'm going to be using the
Makeup Forever aqua XL liner so I'm just
going to take this and line the outer
part of my lash line she didn't really
have any wings which makes me really sad
but she had a little somethin on the
outer part of her lash line that made
her eyes stand out I'm gonna pop my
angled brush into this palette right
here I'm going to take the darker shade
on this side this is expresso and I'm
going to take my Sigma winged liner
brush yo 6 and just go right over the
the blue liner just to soften it up a
little bit right above the darker liner
I'm going to apply whiskey another
pencil brush this is the morphe 5 1 5 I
still made a wing I couldn't stay away
from the wing to baby one it's a Baby
Spice wing I'm gonna put a little bit
more blue on top of that because I feel
like we lost some of it I'm also going
to put some blue liner on my waterline
I'm going to smoke out the bottom
lashline - I'm gonna take dagger Sheree
here
alright so I'm gonna highlight with this
shade right here this is called hi and
I'm going to pop it into my inner corner
and then I'm going to add some glitter
to the inner corners as well for a
little bit of glam this is the Urban
Decay heavy metal glitter in glam rock
and then for mascara I'm going to use
the Tarte TARDIS lash paint mascara I'm
gonna do a couple coats of that before
we pop on our lashes
and I'm just going to add a touch of
eyeliner to my eyes this is the ciaté
fierce flicks eyeliner and I'm just
going to use a little bit on the lower I
mean the really close to the lash line
and then to highlight my brow bone I'm
going to use 13 I'm gonna take this
perfectly precise eyeshadow brush from
Lodi London to apply my brow bone
highlight
okay so now I'm going to set my face
with this powder this is the cap on the
powder in light 45 I'm just going to set
my cranes in place so they don't slide
off anywhere and then to add a flush
color to the cheeks I'm going to take
the Bobbi Brown nectar blush and number
11 and I'm using my me Nene blush brush
to apply it and I'm going to apply it to
the apples image and then I'm going to
sweep it back into my hairline so that
it looks as natural as possible for the
highlight I'm going to use the mary lou
manizer and i'm going to use my morphe m
509 to highlight on the nose the tip of
the nose Cupid's bow make her a little
highlight mustache and then the tops of
the cheekbones I'm going to pick up this
lip liner from the balm it's in the
shade pineapple this is pinky shade
right here and I'm going to line my lips
with it
and baby spice always had a bright pink
lipgloss so I'm going to take my
colour-pop ultra glossy lip in piranha
this is really cute
I feel like it's baby spice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
