so today I'm going to show you how to
freshen up your look and your day so if
you want to learn how to do this then
keep watching I start off my mornings I
usually like to take a nice long hot
shower or if I did that the night before
I'll just wash my face like I did today
and using something different in my
skincare just trying it out this is the
pur Lisse pur delicate gentle soy milk
cleanser and makeup remover just to wash
away the dirt and soothe the skin and
tone it up a bit and then I just gently
Pat my skin dry and lately I've been
using the Peter llamas facial
moisturizer which has been working
amazing I'm really liking how it makes
my skin feel afterwards just very
hydrated and soft to hydrate my body and
using the Gilcrest in somes body lotion
it's a rich formula and it's very fast
drying which is awesome it has
emollients to heal and protect your skin
and then for my hair I'm using the sexy
hair soy renewal cream oil it's pretty
lightweight you can use it before
blow-drying to add like a shine to your
hair but it also removes any kind of
frizzy so I'm just putting that into my
hair before I style it
to refresh my style I'm choosing a piece
that I wouldn't find myself wearing
usually but pairing it with something
that I would just to mix it up a bit and
I'm choosing from these pieces from
hopes couture the first is a midi skirt
with a mini skirt on the inside which is
really cute and flirty and then I have
this black lace crop top which is a
really cute pom by itself if you're
feeling a little bit risque that day or
over a cubed camisole and then I have
this pretty high-waisted lotus-flower
pencil skirt I decided to go with this
one and this is how I styled it
you
you
you
and to refresh my mind sometimes taking
a walk can help clear your thoughts or
maybe taking a drive by yourself to
refresh your mind and even changing up
your music for the drive can be really
soothing now it's time to freshen up
your makeup so I found another under eye
brightener this came in my Ipsy glam bag
it's called lashem and it's a
three-in-one eye brightener and it's
supposed to diminish your dark circles
and fine lines so let's try this out
anything that brightens our lips your
under eyes I'm all for it I'll try it
has like a cooling effect to it to even
out my complexion I'm using the cargo CC
cream and it adjusts to your complexion
I got the medium shade but I think it
does a great job at evening everything
out giving me a nice complexion boost
I'm not going to lie when I first tried
this I was like what is this stuff it's
whitish grey and it's weird but it
actually turns into a nice shade of
color and decrease the visibility of my
hyperpigmentation so I was like okay
okay I can do this so this is great for
one of those lighter makeup days when
you want a nice even skin tone to cover
my under-eye circles I'm going to use
the Evelyn Iona concealer it's going to
help moisturize and soften up your lines
if you happen and also hide and perfect
any imperfections that you have I
usually just put it right underneath my
under eyes the brush that I'm using is
from crown brush and it's C 2 to 4 and
it's good for applying concealer or just
applying cream shadows so I'm just going
to keep this right underneath my eyes
any blemishes that I have I'll just use
a darker concealer
for the brows today and using the
benefits browsing it's a pigmented wax
so it fills in the sparse areas and lays
down the hairs right in place and then
the powder adds more coverage and
mattifies to give your brows and natural
full look
for the eyes and picking up the
two-faced sugar pop palette and I'm
picking up that peach fuzz color and
going to wash this color all over the
lid next I'm picking up the Too Faced
natural matte palette and I'm using the
color strapless to add subtle depth into
the crease and this is going to softly
enhance our natural eye contour for a
pop of cool color and going to take
strawberry ice which is a cool tone
lavender color and I'm going to apply it
to the inner corners honestly if you add
a bit of water to this color I feel like
the color pigment would show through
better but still I thought it was a
really nice fresh pop
now I'm going to add a wing to my look I
feel like it just gives any I love a
sleek flirty touch which is my favorite
look and I usually start out from
outwards and then I'll work my weight
inwards going a thinner as I go in now
I'm just going to apply a few coats of
mascara and then pop on my favorite
lashes for my lashes I'm going to use
the SL miss glam Beauty lashes but these
are my favorite ones I'm going to use my
thrive Cosmetics infinity infinity lash
adhesive this really makes your lashes
stick all day kind of even hurts when
you take it off so there's a really
intense glue but it's my favorite one to
set my foundation I'm going to put on
the urban decay medium neutral Naked
skin powder I always find it better to
set your foundation after you're done
with your eye makeup in case you need to
fix like your eyeliner or if you have
fallout you can just wipe it out so now
that I set my foundation I always like
to brighten up my under eyes you guys
know me I'm using the manic Adar step 2
this is in c3 and I just get a smaller
brush that fits perfectly under my eyes
this one is also from Anna kadar and
just going to brighten up this area
all right so now I'm going to do my
contour really quick today I'm going to
use this Mac 109 brush to contour my
face oh you know what I just got some
new contours in so I'm really excited to
use them they're from two-faced and they
smell like chocolate they're that
chocolate soleal bronzers let me show
you cute and this is the Too Faced
chocolate Soleil ol medium deep matte
bronzer I'm going to use this to contour
today
for the highlight I'm going to use this
two-faced selfie TF no filter powder and
they're basically like filters for your
face in real life and there's sunrise
toasted in ethereal I'm going to use
ethereal just because I have that purple
going on in the center I mean the inner
corners I'm going to keep that vibe
going so I'm going to just place that on
the tops of my cheekbones do I look a
serial yet no okay yeah I think a little
sunrise on top of mmm sunrise on top of
the ethereal just to give it more of a
bright brightening effect um so let's
how let's see how it works out for my
Instagram pictures for my lips I'm going
to use this NYX lipstick in little Suzy
the NYX butter lipstick is very
lightweight and it just melts into your
lips and feels really soft
