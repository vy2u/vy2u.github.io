today I am on the floor if you didn't
notice today I'm going to be doing a
spring makeup hair and outfit video for
you guys I'm super excited that spring
is here and so if you want to learn how
I got this look and this hairstyle then
keep watching so we're going to start
off with my primer this primer is from
make it forever it's the step one skin
equalizer and this is the hydrating
primer they have like five or six of
them that you can mix together but today
I'm just going to use the hydrating
primer so now I'm just going to fill in
my pores a bit around my t-zone so maybe
is my pore fessional for that and I try
even try to get Cesar to use it but you
won't use it it's too manly
you can't tell it on if I mean it's
clear it just makes everything look like
you have a blur tool on your face who
doesn't want that for a foundation today
I'm going to use the Naked skin
weightless ultra definition liquid
makeup and this is in 4.0 I'm going to
blend it in with my Beauty Blender I
always feel like when I apply my
foundation with my Beauty Blender it
comes out super flawless and it never
looks too cakey or anything because the
sponge soaks most of it up so now that
my face is nice and even I'm going to
cover my under-eye circles for that I'm
going to use the NARS creamy concealer
just going to focus it right on the
inner corners today to keep my makeup
light I usually like to do this all the
weekends when I don't want to wear too
much makeup they still want to hide my
under-eye circles so I'll just put it on
the inner corner so it looks really
natural
well my foundation concealer set and dry
I'm going to go ahead and do my brows
and lately I've been using the whitening
lightening brow bar to go and this is
the lightest color they have I think and
it's just the two powders in a brow wax
so that's what I've been doing lately
so next I'm picking up my lorac alter
ego palette
dream girl and just picking up that
rustic brown color it actually applies
more on the orange side so this is a
perfect color for spring/summer time and
this is actually a new palette that just
came out April 2nd and I'm just going to
wash that all over the crease and also
on the lower part of the lash line this
palette is also a new one and this is
called heartbreaker I'm going to pick up
that light frosted pink color and apply
it right onto the lid and also on the
lower part of my inner corners
to make this look a bit more interesting
I'm gonna pop this baby blue on to the
inner corners and if I happen to sound
like a little bit on the manly side
because it's the morning and I am doing
this voiceover this morning so this is a
different day from when I actually
filmed so yeah and for my crease I'm
just going to deepen it up with that
dark brown color and feather it out same
thing I'm going to put this on the lower
part of the outer lash line and bam
there you go and I'm going to take this
gray eyeliner and then the line half of
the top lash line and then I took a
black to tight line and I realized I
think I like the black better so I just
went over the gray and then you'll
notice this happen I think it looks a
lot better this way you can still kind
of see the gray peeking through which is
kind of nice and then I'm going to curl
my lashes apply some of my Too Faced
better than sex mascara and I'm gonna do
that to the top and bottom of my lashes
these are some new lashes that I'm
trying out and they are upside down you
just pull this little string and they
fall out this is real hair and the band
is pretty thin so I'm excited to try
them out so I will be back once I have
my lashes on Betar be for my lid I did
this off-camera but I wanted to do
something a little bit more bright on
the lid so I took this bright pink blush
from makeup geek and this is in
rendezvous and I just popped it on to my
lid right there like that and now it
looks a little bit it gives it more of a
punch to set my foundation I'm using the
Urban Decay Naked light waitlists powder
so I'm just going to press that in just
set my foundation
then I'm gonna just do a light contour
nothing too heavy so for that I'm going
to take my makeup forever pro sculpting
duo and this is in 0-2 and if you notice
I keep looking to the sides because
there's a big monitor right there and
I'm trying to see myself so but I do
have a mirror here so I just like keep
shifting my eyes so I need to just like
pick a place just taking a little bit of
that contour
for my highlight I'm going to take this
golden highlighter here in the palette
just beautiful color I'm just going to
apply that to my nose and the tops of my
cheekbones to give me that nice glowing
effect and this these are my favorite
highlighters right now there's another
one from Make Up For Ever in 0-1 it's
pretty amazing for blush I'm actually
going to use a bronzer so I'm taking my
Too Faced dark chocolate Soleil I said
it wrong the last video but you guys
corrected me so I'm going to use this
bronzer here it's pretty matte and
that's it for the face now I'm going to
move on to the lips for lips I am using
this colour-pop lippie pencil in Westie
and just going to line my lips
for the lipstick I'm going to use the
Anastasia Beverly Hills liquid lipstick
in Bambi I just got these in I'm super
excited to use it because I've seen it
all over Instagram and they look really
nice so I thought this is a perfect
color for spring I'm not gonna lie when
I first put this on I was like what the
heck this thing is so bright but it's
really pigmented so I just went with it
and after I just decided to keep
applying it it looks pretty good
actually
well that's bright oh my knees hurt Oh
oh my god now that I'm done being an old
woman I'm going to show you how to do my
spring hairstyle I'm using my foxy locks
extensions and Sunkist Brown and I'm
going to click them in and then I'm
gonna curl my hair in all one direction
just going towards the back and then
once I have it curled this part is like
really easy it's just all curling your
hair backwards I'm backwards towards the
back and then once you have it all
curled and then I take a hair tie and
I'm going to make a side ponytail and
then once I have my big ponytail
I love using extensions with ponytails
because it just makes it look so full
and it looks a lot better I'm going to
take a piece of hair from the back and
then wrap it around the band and after I
have that done I'm going to take a bobby
pin and I'm going to secure it in place
just kind of put it in the back and
fluff it up a bit and this is what it
looks like
super cute very girly very spring
appropriate and if you do this hairstyle
