going to do strobing tutorial for you
guys I had no idea what that was two
days ago I was on my periscope the other
night and you guys had mentioned I
should do a strobing tutorial and I was
like what the heck is that and I looked
it up they said nikkietutorials did one
and there is so much hype about it but
all it was is just highlighting /
highlighting your face you get to see
how I feel about it at the end of this
video but this is it I hope you guys
enjoy the video let's get started I
actually have an extra step in there for
people with acne prone skin and scarring
because I think it's really tricky when
you try to highlight a face like that
because you can easily highlight your
imperfections and it just looks really
messy
so what I'm gonna do first is highlight
with a matte powder I'm gonna go in with
my Kat Von D palette I like to use this
yellow color and this pink one together
so I'm just gonna take these two and go
over the areas where I'm gonna bring
forward so I'm going to do the center of
my forehead I'm also gonna go on the
tops of my cheekbones and the Cupid's
bow and the chin I'm going to skip on
the nose for this one just because it's
not as bumpy as these areas and that's
pretty much it okay so now that I'm done
with my matte highlight I'm gonna go in
with my illuminating highlighter and I
have all of my favorites right here and
put it on snapchat last night because I
have so many and I was just trying to
figure out which one to use and a lot of
you guys had said the mary-lou manizer
and i really want to use this one from
hourglass it's the luminous light and
it's because I just got it it's new so
I'm going to use this one and moonstone
from Becca and mary loumanizer so I'm
just going to dip my brush in all three
of them and make it really strobe II the
brush I'm going to be using is from bare
minerals this is the dual finish blush
and contour so I'm gonna stir
by highlighting the center of my
forehead and I have a lot of bumpiness
around this areas though just
highlighted that unfortunately um but
you're also going to highlight the tops
of your cheekbones and if you have
bumpiness and this area then keep it
really minimal you don't need to put on
a ton of highlighter if you're just
going to accentuate your blemishes I'm
also going to do the tip of my nose the
center of my Cupid's bow and my chin go
ahead and hit the tops of your brow bone
and the inner corners the last place
you're going to highlight with this
highlight is right where your contour
would be underneath
I like everything for my blush I'm going
to use something that's Matt I'm just
gonna stay away from something that's
super shimmery I'm going to use
infatuation this is a makeup geek blush
it's a peachy blush and going to put
that on my cheeks and after you're done
with that then you're going to take a
finishing spray I'm taking my Mac prep
and prime at fix+ and just spray your
face so that you don't have any powdery
spots and it just looks dewy and
luminous we just stroked my face i
highlighted all over the place
do I like it it's not for my skin type I
think if you have just flawless natural
skin it's beautiful it'll give you a
really nice fresh look perfect for the
summer if you have skin like mine I have
indentations and acne scarring so it
just highlights that area a little bit
more I like it in this area I usually do
it on my nose my Cupid's bow anyways I
kind of like it here too
but I wouldn't do it in the middle the
center of the forehead leave me a
comment let me know what you want to see
next down below and that's it I love you
guys so much I'll see you in my next
video bye Nellie's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
