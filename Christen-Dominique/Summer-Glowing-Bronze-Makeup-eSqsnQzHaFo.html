doing a summer bronze glowing makeup
tutorial as you can see it's super
glowing I was shopping at Ulta this
weekend and I grabbed a whole bunch of
bronze and shimmery things so I was like
I need to make a summer bronze glow a
makeup tutorial before summer ends so
that's what I did and I hope you guys
enjoy it actually no you guys are gonna
love this look on yourself I feel like
anybody can accomplish this especially
with this holy grail right now is my
holy grail this is the Laura Geller
gilded honey baked illuminator it looks
like the Sun is literally right there
right there on my face it is so
beautiful if you guys don't have this
you definitely need to check it out this
is the reason why I have all of this
dewy glow enos so this one is you guys
have to try it and that's it I love you
guys and I hope you guys enjoy the start
out with using the Tarte BB tinted
primer and it has a SPF of 30 which is
awesome for the summer I didn't used to
care about SPF as much as I do now
protect you from those UV rays I like
how this smooths out your skin and at
the same time it gives you a really good
coverage it reminds me of the BB cream
from bareMinerals the prime time it's
kind of like that because it's a BB and
a primer it smooths out your skin and it
gives you that coverage for concealer
I'm going to use this amazing cosmetics
concealer this is in light golden
underneath my eyes I sometimes like to
use my fingers because my body heat
warms up the concealer so it allows it
to melt into your skin and it blends
really easy and makes you look super
flawless
I'm gonna let my concealer and
foundation set and while I'm doing that
I'm going to do my brows I'm using the
Anastasia brow Wiz and this is in medium
brown just filling in the sparse area
for my brows today I'm going to do
something that's pretty quick and easy
I'm just going to fill in the sparse
areas so my eyeshadow I'm going to be
using the Too Faced natural matte
palette and I'm going to start off with
chocolate cookie color right here and on
a 224 brush I'm just going to blend it
into the crease now I'm going to pick up
risk' this color right here and I'm a
focus this are on the inner and outer
part of the lid
now I'm going to take this beautiful
bronzy color this is from urban decay
and this isn't baked I'm gonna take it
with my ring finger and pop it on to the
center of the lid
now I'm just using the other side of my
brush it has a little bit of the
chocolate cookie on it so this is going
to help blend out the edges then I'm
going to pop back into risk' and I'm
going to apply it right on the lower
part of my lash line we're basically
just going to do what we did to the top
of the lid we're going to do the exact
same thing to the bottom for my inner
corners I'm going to highlight with my
laura geller
baked illuminator and this is in gilded
honey I'm just going to wet my brush a
little bit and dip it into the sky I'm
actually going to switch my brushes out
this one's not picking up as much as I
want so I'm going to use this one this
is a pencil brush so now I'm going to
define the top lashline to do that I'm
using my Lancome art liner I'm actually
gonna stop where my lid stops today I'm
not winging it out but I am going to go
from thin to thick on my lid so I still
have that angle going on and then I'm
gonna coat my lashes with the Tarte
lights camera lashes I'm going to apply
the Ardell glamour whispies in black and
I'm doing two because I don't have my
wing and I need that extra flare I want
to look really fluffy in the eye area
now they're extra fluffy usually like to
let it get tacky for about 20 seconds
and I'll just pop them on to the to the
center
you
I have my benefit powder right here in
the color champagne and I'm just going
to set my under eye makeup with that and
I'm basically just setting everywhere I
get oily I'm not going to do the
complete face because I want it to look
a little dewy and glowing for bronzer
I'm going to use the Too Faced dark
chocolate deep tan matte bronzer and I'm
going to use this as a blush so next I'm
going to use the Laura Geller
illuminator this is DHing gilded honey
and it's beautiful you guys I have to do
a close-up on this
I feel like the Sun is bouncing off of
my face right next I'm gonna use my NYX
lip liner and this is in the color nude
for my lipstick I'm using the NYX high
voltage lipstick and Niraj
this is my summer bronze glowing makeup
