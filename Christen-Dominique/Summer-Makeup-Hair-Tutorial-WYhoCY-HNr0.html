doing this look right here I did this on
snapchat a few days ago I was trying out
all the new Jacqueline Hill Becca collab
stuff and I came up with this look you
guys seem to really like it so I wanted
to try it out for you in this video also
I'm doing this
beachy summer waves in my hair and I
have a new length it's a lot shorter
than what it was and so I wanted to
incorporate medium hair Beach waves for
you guys so I hope you enjoyed this
video in these looks if you want to
learn how to get them then keep watching
literally take two of doing my
foundation Ceasar saved me he said I
look like a ghost in my last two take
because I had this really white
foundation on I'm going to be using this
Becca backlight priming filter I
recently just went to the Jacqueline
Hill Becca event where she launched all
her products and sold out within 90
minutes I think it was or was at 90
minutes or 90 seconds she sold out like
as soon as it came out so how amazing is
that I'm gonna be using a lot of the
products from her Lionel II I wouldn't
like to put things on my face that are
like attract light to the texture on my
face but I really like this one
this your backlight filter you see how
it just makes it look I don't know wait
this is literally glowing from within
like do we natural it's not it just
doesn't make me look doesn't make my
skin look bad you know just makes it
look really nice and hydrated I don't
know it's really pretty though I love it
and now I'm going to go ahead and take
some of my Tarte Amazonian clay full
coverage foundation put some of that on
today I like the way my skin came out in
my last video I loved the way my think
you know actually
so I decided I've been using this
foundation ever since or did I use it in
my last my video before the last one I
don't know whichever one it was I was
like dang I need to use that every day
anybody else have like dandruff problems
like me Jandra is just everywhere and I
haven't been using head and shoulders in
like a really long time just because I
don't like the way because my hair feel
um but I feel like I should be because I
have so many white spots in my hair but
that's okay we're all friends I'm not
judging each other's white spots in our
hairs I'm blending that down into my
neck look how red my eyes were so now my
face is all covered and nice and even
I'm going to go ahead and use this
correcting palette this is from Stila I
have literally been trying to use this
for the past two weeks I took it on
travels with me and I keep forgetting to
use it every morning I put it out I'm
north I don't put it out it's already
there in front of me I just forget to
use it as I immediately put on my
primary foundation and concealer like
it's I just don't think about it and I
keep forgetting to use because I want to
try it I think it's because it's so
vibrant in Orange
I just want to see how it works on me
I'm just going to take this brush right
here just right here not too too much
you see are you had some on my brush
though and I think that's because I just
put my entire face on and then took it
right back off when I Pat my concealers
in I like to do just that with hat
very lightly and soft because if you
move them around like this it's
literally just moving it around and it's
not really giving you the most coverage
so always use a light patting hand
whenever you're working in your
concealers or anything that has to do
with your skin up here I'm going to go
ahead and use my naked skin concealer in
a neutral light handy dandy concealer
this came out last year and this still
is my favorite I like to let this sit
for a second I feel like it really
sticks in the skin better if you just
let it sit for 30 seconds longer than
what you normally would then I'm just
going to get my beauty blender and blend
this little guy out all right so now I'm
just going to go ahead and do my brows
I'm going to do that off camera and then
I'll be back with my brows and we'll be
getting straight into the eye shadow
alright so now that I'm done with my
brows going to my eyes I'm going to use
the Becca Jacqueline Hill eyes shadow
palette and look how beautiful this
palette is like it looks very luxe I
don't know it's like it looks very
high-end I'm going to take this middle
shade right here as my transition this
guy which is called wardrobe so I'm
going to go in with this guy and load up
my Mac 1 to 22 brush so I'm going to go
ahead
see how it's like very subtle but this
is going to help I'm transitioning with
the shade someone to the next and it
look really stop try to make sure when
you're blending that your hand is at the
very end of your brush so that you can
move around your products super easy
you'll notice that your blend is a lot
softer I'm going to take this medium
brown here and then work this into the
outer part of the lid I'm just using
circular motions dry I um I get into
teacher voice I don't know if you guys
notice this but sometimes when I'm
talking my voice turns into a teacher
like voice I don't know why
now I'm going to take the darkest color
I'm going to take a clean fluffy brush
is the more cd44 one work it outwards to
the brow bone for my lid I'm going to
use this beautiful color right here it's
called champagne toast should I shadow
brush into that
for the inner quarters I'm going to take
the lightest shade which is Chardonnay
load up my brush with it just pop it
into the inner corners
I like this on the inner corners and I'm
feeling like I want to pop it on to the
center of my lid
I'm gonna highlight highlighted eyelids
inner corners everything our whole face
is going to play oh I'm going to go
ahead and put some eyeliner on
for the inner corners I'm just going to
pop on this Urban Decay heavy-metal
glitter liner this is in Midnight Cowboy
it dresses up your face so fast I use
this every single day during Gen 30
during New York for Jacqueline Hills
event this is just such a pretty neutral
glitter alright so now that I have that
on I'm going to go ahead and pop on some
eyelashes and I'll be right back okay so
I'm going to set my face with the Kat
Von D medium 53 powder load my brush up
okay for my bronzer I'm going to use the
S state edit the barest bronzer in light
medium I'm gonna use everything around
the highlight though in that part it's
going bronze at my cheeks now I got my
cheekbones check it around my temples
this is a new palette from dr. hill and
Becca it gives a blush in highlight
palette and use that middle shape on the
right oh pop it onto my cheeks
I'm going to use this shade right here
is highlight that's like an instant band
where the lipstick I'm going to take max
fast play lipstick
okay so now that the makeups done I'm
going to go ahead and move on to my hair
so right now it's just in a big sloppy
burger okay so now I'm going to do my
hair I'm going to do summer beach waves
in my hair just very effortless I have a
new me straightener I have a nume
curling wand and now I have this lustrum
set right here it's a five-piece wand
set and you can create any type of curl
or wave in your hair it's so versatile
it's easy to comes with a glove so that
you know that this heat protectant
gloves so you don't burn yourself I
don't use the glove anymore I feel like
I'm pretty comfortable without the glove
but it does have it in there for you
just in case you need it and it has a
little holder for it here you put it
into the barrel you're going to lock it
in this lock sign you just turn it and
then you just click the switch on and
then it heats up in like two seconds it
heats up to about 410 degrees Fahrenheit
so it's really really hot this is the
largest one that areas in there so I'm
going to take about this much hair hold
it any way you want at this point make
sure that there is a nice gap between
there and that you have some hair
hanging out and just leave it on there
for like five seconds eight five to
eight seconds and then let it go
you just keep doing the same thing all
around your head so I'm going to do the
next one and you want to make sure it's
straight up and down have a little piece
hanging out then you want to make sure
there's a gap between there let it go
if your hair is a little bit too tight
the curls what you do is get your
straightener and I just go through it in
no specific way just kind of go through
it and run your straightener down the
curls and looks more effortless in loose
