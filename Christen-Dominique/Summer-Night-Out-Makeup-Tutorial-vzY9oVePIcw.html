today I'm going to be doing a summer
night makeup tutorial and I'm using
green at the bottom lash line which I
love I love this look I'm actually going
out tonight and also I'm going to show
you how I get this fluffiness at my pony
or my messy pony I recently have fell in
love with the messy pony
if you want to learn how to get this
look then keep watching I don't know I'm
going to prep my face I'm going to use
my makeup forever step 1 base hydrate so
I'm going to hydrate my lips I'm using
the Jersey Shore cosmetics vanilla
coconut cream mongongo lip conditioner
just to prep my lips to and for
foundation I'm going to be using the
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation
this is in 125 so I'm going to apply it
with my Beauty Blender so just put a
little bit on my hand and just going to
even out my skin tone
alright so now I'm going to conceal my
under eye circles because those things
are pesky and they don't want to go away
so the first time I'm using the Mac Pro
Longwear concealer or anything from Mac
I haven't you ever used like a
foundation or anything from them and it
works amazing
now it's time to fill in the brows I'm
going to go ahead and fill them in with
my Anastasia dip brow and I am in the
color ash brown if you guys are
wondering this color matches my hair
color perfectly I've tried all the
different colors in the dip brow family
and this one is my go-to since this is
going to be an all nighter look I'm
going to take some brow powder to go
over the dip brow it's going to hold the
intensity in place and I'm only going
over the area where I need it like on my
tail ends in the top of my left brow try
to avoid the parts of your brow that are
naturally full because then it look can
look overdone trust me I used to make
this mistake all the time and it just
looked like I had to big thick sharpie
brows on my face just saying all right
so now I'm picking up this Paint Pot
from Mac this is in soft ochre I'm going
to lay it down my lid and this is what I
realize like dang this stuff is thick
but it blends out and when it blends it
makes your eyeshadow intense and I don't
know why I haven't been using this my
entire youtube life but I am now so
that's all that matters nice and picking
up peanut butter and I'm going to wash
that into the crease this is definitely
one of my favorite transition colors I
love those orange e Brown rustic colors
for the Greeks
next I'm going to use the jelly pong
pong two-in-one shadow liner and I'm
just going to go over my lid with it and
then blend it out using my ring finger
I'm going to go back into peanut butter
and I'm going to apply it to the lower
lash line I'm printing a pretty heavy
amount on there so don't be scared don't
worry pack it on next I'm going to grab
the nikah k eyeshadow quad from the Ipsy
glam bag and I'm going to pick up that
green color and apply it right onto the
lower lash line really close to the lash
line but you still want that peanut
butter color to peak through to add some
light to the inner corners I'm going to
take the Ofra cosmetics eyeshadow in the
color bliss and I'm just going to pop it
on to the inner corners and this is
super pigmented the awesome thing about
this is you can wear it as a highlighter
as well and it would look beautiful it's
wing time and I'm going to use my NYX
matte liquid liner to do this I've been
using it for a few weeks and I'm really
liking it I have a lot of control it
reminds me of E and Y C liquid liner but
this one drives matter
I'm going to pick up the Tarte lights
camera lashes and apply some mascara
so I'm going to take these two lashes
I'm taking two sets of these kiss
diva lashes and I'm just going to
overlap them like so they already have
an adhesive so it's pretty easy just to
mesh them together I'm going to focus
these on the outer corners of my eyes so
I get that shiner you set down your lash
where you want it then I'm going to go
ahead and press together the false lash
with the real one and I'm going in with
my tweezers I like using them because
they're more precise I push it up a
little bit so while the glue is still
tacky so it grips on to your eyelid and
what that does it creates more of a
bright doughy eyed look so I'm going to
go back over the lash line with the
liquid liner just so that it looks
seamless anytime I want long-lasting
full coverage I always grab my Urban
Decay powder this powder makes your
makeup last a really long time and it
also adds an extra layer of coverage
which is awesome
I'm going to do some contouring i'm
going to use my Kat Von D pallet taking
that color right there and I just got
this NARS a kabuki contour brush so I'm
excited to use it see how it works
I heard it's amazing for blending your
contour so I'm going to go right below
my cheekbone with this and along the
sides of my nose you know the usual
stuff it's pretty good pretty
I love this contour doh
this is my favorite part of my makeup
routine highlighting my face brightening
it it makes everything look lifted and
just flawless I'm taking my Kat Von D
yellow powder and mixing the yellow and
pink powder together and I'm just taking
that along the sides of my nose
underneath my under eye circles and
going all the way up to the tops of my
cheekbones and so this gives me a more
lifted look it's going to brighten this
area and like I said it just makes you
look flawless now I'm going to go on top
of the bridge of my nose and the center
of my forehead I'm also going to hit to
the Cupid's bow and the chin
for my cheek color I'm going to mix
these two together this is the Tarte
Amazonian clay waterproof bronzer in
Park Avenue princess and the blush in
fearless and I'm just mixing them
together applying them behind the apple
of my cheek bone and then going up all
the way into the temple
I felt like adding a little bit of an
extra glow to my cheek bone so I grabbed
my Gerard cosmetics star powder in
Audrey to bump up that glow I want to go
for a naturally full defined lip so I'm
going to take my strip-down lip pencil
and over line my lip a little bit and
then for the lip color I'm going to use
cheese and this is the read my lips
lipstick and killing me softly I'm going
to make a combination of this lipstick
with Mac Smith to create a unique lip
color that is going to fit this
eyeshadow look perfectly
I decided at the end of this look that
it needed more dramas so I added some
black liner to the waterline I'm going
to show you how I get my fluffiness in
the back of my ponytail and what I
normally do is just take a dry shampoo
and spritz it at the base today I'm
using the Eva NYC freshen up dry shampoo
and I like this one because there's no
white residue so you can go crazy with
it and spray as much as you want on the
base of the ponytail and then what you
want to do is tug at the very base of
the ponytail and that's going to give
you even more of a voluminous look and
it lasts all day and it looks super cute
and it's an awesome hairstyle for the
summer if you guys want a hair tutorial
