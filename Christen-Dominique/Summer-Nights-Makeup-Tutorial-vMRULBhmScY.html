summer nights makeup look right here I
saw these palettes these new palettes
from colour-pop the I love Study X color
pop collab and I got so inspired to do
this look I actually end up using all
the shadows in both palettes because
they're just so pretty and I just use
them all over my face this is what
happens you toys they're pretty I put
them all over my face love these
palettes Karen is actually a friend of
mine and I'm very very excited for her
in this collaboration I think it's an
amazing collection and everything is so
well put together the color story of
everything just it's so beautiful so I
decided to make this summer night to
makeup look
I love how dramatic it is if you're
going to be partying if you're going to
be getting into some thoughtful
activities at night this is going to be
a gorgeous look for you so I hope you
guys love it as well if you want to

videos subscribe to my channel to keep

notification bell if you haven't already
so that you're part of the quad family
and without further ado if you want to
learn how to get this look right here
then keep watching hello okay so I'm
going to start off with a primer I'm
going to use this one from L'Oreal this
is the visible lift radiance booster
brightening primer 24-hour hydration ooh
I like the color of this like a peachy
it doesn't smell like anything that's
good things kind of a thick primer nice
and bright and ready to go if we are
going for a dramatic nighttime look I
want to have the full coverage on my
face so I'm going in today we're doing
it big using the Kat Von D lock-it
foundation in medium 50 to warm up every
time I've gotten this foundation it's
either for a Halloween video and it's
either way too white on purpose or way
too dark not on purpose but I just can't
find my shade so I'm hoping praying to
the gods that this is my
shade medium 52 let's try this please
Beautyblender
you see everything on my face is about
to disappear every mole every acne spot
blemish everything on my face is about
to turn in to flawlessness so let's do
this
these earrings are so heavy I feel like
my earlobes are about to drop to my
knees okay I always tend to get
foundation in my hair and I'm going to
try not to do that today so wish me luck
you guys blend it down to my neck I'm
gonna put some concealer on using this
Tarte shape tape in light/medium right
on top of the panda eyes so just right
in there this concealer is actually
darker than the foundation you dab dab
dab my little sponge right underneath my
eyes I'm gonna use this wet and wild
ultimate brow kit every time I find a
new wet and wild brow product I get
stuck to it and use it for like ever
this is a brow powder in brunette I feel
like the powders are a lot easier to use
they're a lot quicker so I'm just gonna
build up that tail end because it's
looking kind of scrawny I'm gonna go
ahead and carve out my brows underneath
a little bit so I'm gonna take some of
the concealer and just work that all
over my lid and just carve out my bra to
make it look really nice and sharp I'm
excited to do my eyes today because I'm
going to be using Karen's palette I love
satays palette I'm so excited
the first palette there's two one is
called saucy right here which I'm going
to be using a lot of and then one is I'm
actually going to be using both of these
pallets together I'm just going to go
back and forth between them and then the
other palette is called Shiki which is
this one right here first color I'm
gonna pick up is from the saucy palette
it's this shade right here this is chic
happens and I'm going to work that on to
the crease
oh these are pigmented oMG what I'm
basically doing right now is washing it
into the crease so you're going to see
this is just part of the transition and
creating that def there so you have a
light wash of that color okay I just
realized that this transition shade
matches my background so perfectly now
I'm going to go into the other palette
right here this is cheeky and I'm gonna
take this matte shade right here which
is freckles for that I'm going to take
this pur cosmetics brush in blending
crease that's what it's called I'm going
to pick up freckles and pop it into the
crease hmmm is a little bit more dense
so it's giving me more color you see how
it's tightly packed so I'm going to
actually use this one just to feather it
all all these subtle hints of color are
going to make a for really nice smooth
gradient and a really nice smooth
transition so I'm going to go ahead and
pick up the purple the shade right here
which is called raise II raising some
kind of crazy and work that onto the
outer part of the lid I'm gonna bring it
up into the outer part of the crease I'm
going to go back into my blending brush
right here and start to soften those
edges out and diffuse that color into
the skin I'm just using these quick
little circular motions I'm barely
touching the skin so that the brush just
glides across and you get a smoother
blend that way I'm going to extend it
out a little past my lid to give it that
extra drama I'm going to grab a little
bit of this brown right here this is the
shade no chit and just start to darken
out outer corner a tad bit more we want
it to look like noce that's nice and
dark I like the way that looks so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to take a
little bit of heavy glam a little bit of
that guy and a little bit of vivacious
just going to mix the two together we're
just going to make them best friends so
I'm going to go ahead and take that on
the inner part of the lid keep it toward
heavier on the inner corner
and then lightly sweep it into the lid I
love how pigmented these shadows are
they're intense I love it okay now we're
going to go ahead and work those shades
down on the lower lash line I'm going to
first start basically what I did to the
crease is what I'm going to do to the
lower outer part of the lower lash line
so I'm going to take this little brush
right here to the t2 from the makeup
shock I'm gonna first start off with his
cheek happens okay and then the next
color is going to be that plum shade is
crazy I like saying that racy right put
that closer to the lash line so I want
it to be the darkest right in there take
this brush right here this is from Luxy
it's the 141 brush and I'm just going to
sweep that back and forth just so that
we can get a really nice blended look
okay so now I'm going to grab this color
right here this is distressed it's this
matte bone color it's gonna clean up my
brow make it pop and then it's also
going to help the shadow that went a
little bit too high for me we're gonna
bring it back down make everything look
nice and blended
I'm gonna go ahead and take this purple
liner from japonesque it's called
there's no name on it it's just purple I
was like a purple tip and it's purple so
I'm gonna go ahead and line my waterline
with this so now I'm gonna go ahead and
do the wing on my eye so I'm going to
take my Kat Von D eyeliner just start
inside right here in that inner corner
and you don't have to do one smooth
motion just slowly gradually make your
way to the other side
and then do a little flick upwards like
that bring it back down it's not gonna
cut my lashes with mascara I just found
out about this mascara when I went with
L'Oreal toucans and they had this in my
room to try oh my god I thought I love
the Maybelline Big Shot colossal this is
like on another level I am obsessed with
this mascara it is so good the packaging
is so pretty in pink and it's just so
freakin good
this is the wand there short little
bristles it's like an s-curve to it and
I don't know what exactly it does but it
just makes your lashes wash like huge
and so I'm just gonna pop that on to my
masca this is going to be my new
favorite mascara I didn't think that a
drugstore would come out with something
like this but they did this is better
than high-end mascaras okay so now that
we've coated the lashes I'm going to go
ahead and pop on some lashes from who a
beauty these are these Sasha number 11s
these guys right here I'm going to cut
them pop them on and then I will be
right back so next I'm going to contour
my face to contour I'm using the deep
honey Tarte clay stick foundation and
I'm just going to chisel the cheeks slim
the nose I'm going to go real close for
this this foundation is a little bit too
light for me so it's going to help
bronze on my face so that's a good thing
okay and for the blush I'm going to take
this NARS
liquid blush right here just a little
bit goes so long I'm using luster we'll
pop that onto my cheeks I feel like it
blends in really well with your finger
or like a Beauty Blender and this is a
really nice Coralie shade so now we are
going to do the liquid highlight I'm
gonna take the cover FX custom enhancer
drop in sunlight pop that home you can
use this alone or you can pop a
highlight on top and it's going to be
extreme and that's what I'm going for
so we're gonna make it extreme make sure
you don't have any harsh lines where you
put your highlight you never to set
everything in place I'm going to take my
Kat Von D shade + light contour palette
this is the refillable one that has like
four full taka gene and I refilled it
I'm gonna look up to the sky and then I
am going to look down okay good look up
to the sky again now I'm just going to
set everything in place with the powder
I haven't been doing this lately but
since this is a summer night out kind of
a makeup look it's probably hot it's
probably dark and I don't want my makeup
going anywhere so I'm going to keep it
intact with this Kat Von D I'm using a
lot of Kat Von D today because I
reloaded my stash so I think I'm just
really excited that I have a whole bunch
of Kat Von D back in my life is just
lightly
it there all over then I'm going to grab
my Estee Lauder bronze goddess whoo I
love this freakin bronzer it's amazing
it's me and medium deep zero 3 I'm going
to take this bronzer right here and I'm
going to bronze up my cheeks just a
burnt piece of toast I'm gonna use this
blush right here it's actually called
highlight the truth it's the mineralized
skinfinish from Matt I'm only gonna put
on a little bit this looks like an
intense blush I'm only gonna put on a
little bit proceeds to put on the entire
compact work that in make it a little
bit more blended fill the highlight when
you use the Estee Lauder bronze goddess
illuminating powder in heatwave this is
such a beautiful highlight literally
just almost blinded my eyeball that's
how good it is pop that onto my cheeks
nose the Cupid's bow this is like a
golden midnight glow like you're going
to be glowing in the dark so now that we
are glowing to the gods we can move on
to the lips which is the last part of
the look that I think I want to go with
the new deist one this is a curvy lip
liner I'm going to take 9 v 1 which is a
satin lip and pop it on my lips and then
after that dries I'm going to put on the
gloss this is in curvy I'm going to take
that and pop it on to the center of the
lips thank you guys for watching I hope
