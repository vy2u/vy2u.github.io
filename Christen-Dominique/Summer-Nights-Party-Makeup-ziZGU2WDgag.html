free this summer if you want to know how
I got it let's begin
okay so first I'm gonna start off by
using this liquid mineral foundation in
beige perfection I like it because it's
oil and paraben free not to mention it
gives me an airbrushed finish without
using the actual machine so that's
always a plus I have acne prone skin so
mineral makeup like this is always a
plus for me and I love the flawless
finish it gives you next I'm gonna be
picking up this HD eye primer so that my
shadow lasts longer and shows it more
vibrant also it does prevent creasing so
I really like this primer specifically
because a lot of primers say they do
prevent creasing and they don't then I'm
going to pick up light this eye pencil
in a mint delight this is going to be
our base color so we're gonna apply it
all over the lid and don't forget the
lower lash line now for the fun part I'm
gonna take this thick neutral shadow
quad in trend maverick and I'll be using
this really pretty shimmery green color
and placing it over the lid and the
lower lash line next I'll be taking this
beautiful iridescent made color and
placing it on the center of the lid
doing this is gonna make your eyes pop
it's gonna look really really nice
or the inner corner highlight I'm going
to take this lemon color shadow and I'm
going to apply it to the inner corners
and a little bit of the lower lash line
going back into the mint color I'll be
placing this in between the darker green
and the yellow for added fun and
brightness so then after that I'm gonna
take this darker Brown and I'm joinin it
has gold flecks and it's really really
pretty and I'm gonna just place this on
the outer half of the eye and I had a
lot on my brush so I just literally
placed it where I wanted it and then I
got a clean brush and blended it out
like I'm doing now and I'm just placing
a little bit more back into there into
that area because I want it to be a
little bit more defined darker and
that's what that looks like I'm also
gonna take that same dark brown and just
apply it on the lower lashes or lash
line the outer portion and go back into
the yellow and highlight your brow bone
using black eyeliner relying your
waterline and tightline ac-1
time to make this look super sexy and
fun
I love bitch hat I honestly I were the
cat eye everywhere but on my bare lids
without any shadow when I put makeup on
but for the average person this is what
makes it a party look again I don't know
about you but I love super dramatic eyes
perk up your lashes this stuff is pretty
important and then you want to use your
favorite mascara and here I'm using the
Lola lash mascara and it makes my lashes
look super flirty I love it and then I'm
gonna take pretty impeach to my cheeks
to complete this look I'll be using this
lip gloss and heaven Lily I hope you
enjoyed this video and into the next
look
bye dollies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
