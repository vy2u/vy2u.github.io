video today I'm gonna do a summer like
colorful summer makeup look and
something like me and my cute purple one
from H&amp;amp;M two four ten so I just changed
into my shirt I'm wearing pretty simple
things today just some jeans that he's
actually my favorite boyfriend jeans and
the same gold heels I was wearing in my
last video because I really like on that
I'm about to start my summer makeup
tutorial I have Jayden with me here
today and I have Caesar so say hi guys
hi Jayden was waiting for this moment
right now he kept asking all morning are
you gonna put me in your video so here
he goes with this little tooth missing
so I'm gonna use a different primer I'm
gonna step out of my box this is from
ziwei and it's an anti blemish matte
primer to try this out I have dry skin
it is acne prone so this may be the
primer for my skin type feels very
velvety for a foundation today since
it's a summer look I'm going to go for
something that's a lot more lightweight
to the naked skin from Urban Decay and
it's in the shade 4.0 this is definitely
a buildable foundation it can definitely
go from very light coverage to medium
coverage so I'm just going to put a
little bit of this on and with this with
this foundation I'm not really looking
for coverage I'm really just wanting to
even out my skin tone so now that I have
my skin tone even I'm just going to fill
in where the dark circles would be in
the redness another really lightweight
concealer NARS concealer in medium one
custard and this is the radiant creamy
concealer to brighten up and to hide any
redness and blemishes I actually don't
feel like I have that much redness
because of the foundation I used earlier
so I think I'm just going to focus this
on my eyes
since I am going to be using a little
bit more color on my eyelids I'm going
to I don't like using primers because I
feel like they don't allow you to blend
very well so I'm going to use concealer
and I'm just going to put it right above
my lid right so now that my face is done
I'm going I'm going to move on to my
eyebrows this is the universal brow
pencil from it cosmetics looks like that
it's a taupe color brow pencil and it's
retractable just fill in the sparse
areas of my brows it's usually right
right in the center and then on the tail
you can use a lighter hand and get a
lighter color if you have you know
blonde hair and then you can press down
a little harder and get more color
payoff if you were setting powder today
I'm going to use this translucent
finishing powder from Tarte it's the
Amazonian clay pressed finishing powder
and this is in smooth operator does make
it seem like I have no pores
right now I'm going to jump into the
eyeshadow really excited about this one
because I'm using color today which I
haven't used in a really long time on my
channel I have something in my nose I'll
be back I had a little friend in there
we're good now getting started on the
eyes I am using my buxom palette so I'm
going to grab this fluffy brush this is
the 221 and I'm going to take this color
right here and I'm going to dust this
all over my lid all the way up to the
brow bone
and then the next color I'm going to
pick up is this one and I'm going to
place this one on the inner and outer
corners of my eyes
now I'm either going to put the purple
one or the green one in the center I'm
trying to figure that one out right now
another shader brush right here this is
from zoeva this is the 234 and I'm going
to take some of this beautiful purple
color this is called la la la beche now
I'm just going to go back into this
brown color right here and apply it to
the crease now I'm going to take my
shader brush and I'm going to flip it
over to the clean side and I'm going to
start to drag the crease color outwards
towards eyebrow bone also going to apply
it to my lower lash line I'm going to
connect it from the end of my lid bring
it all the way over down here I'll leave
a little bit of a space for the inner
corner we're going to pop the purple
back on right into the center to do that
I'm going to I'm going to use this
pencil brush this one is from Sigma and
it's the e30 I'm going to take this same
beautiful purple color right here up it
into the inner corners
this is just a clean brush it's the 227
soft definer from zoeva I'm just going
to soften up the edges of the eyeshadow
I added a matte highlight in here this
one right here has a yellow undertone
which I love one this is from SL mist
glam Beauty such a cute brush isn't it
I've had it for a while I just haven't
got around to use them but they're so
pretty and it's really soft so I'm going
to use this one to grab some of my wood
fill in my and fill in my arm when I
don't what I don't have a napkin or
something to wipe my brushes on I just
use the inside of my wrist and so I'm
going to do is take some of this color
right here when I apply it to my brow
bone softly drag it into the lid I'm
also going to tight line my waterline
this is the lash domination from
bareMinerals
now I'm going to apply lashes the lashes
that I'm using are from ardell they're
the natural demi wispies in black so i'm
going to apply these right here and i
brought two pairs because i was thinking
of stacking them on top of each other
and just to give me more of a dramatic
dirty look so i'm going to stack the
lashes on top of each other
and they should already be kind of tacky
so I'm just going to stick them right
along that line and then just hold it
together
I'm going to tilt my head back and then
set it down right on the center and then
I just attach one side at a time so now
I'm just going to mesh my real lash with
my false one and it takes some of this
mascara and just apply it to the tips of
my lashes I'm going to use the Tarte
Park Avenue princess matte bronzer
so I'm going to use blissful it has a
little bit more color to it I'm going to
mix this in with my two-faced um beach
bunny bronzer for my highlight I'm going
to use the shave light using this middle
color right here it's matte go down the
bridge of the nose center of the
forehead that and then for the tops of
my cheekbones I'm going to use the city
color this is a bronzer and sunset so
pretty right and I'm going to use this
golden tree right here I'm just going to
take a little bit of that with my fan
brush and sweep it on the tops of my
cheekbones
and a little bit on the nose on to the
lips I really do have something just
right in front of my eyeball right now
and I cannot see but it's bothering me
oh it's on my eyeball do you like when I
say that my lip color I'm going to use
this NYX butter gloss in apple strudel
and looks like this it's a little bit
too pinky for me so I'm going to go over
the top with Park Avenue princess butter
lipsticks and tart and this is the
finished look guys I hope you enjoyed
