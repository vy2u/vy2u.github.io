so today I'm gonna be doing at this cold
tone makeup look and I wanted to do
something that's right in the middle of
summer to fall perfect for that
transition so if you like what you see
thank you but I love this I spray it on
my face everyday even if I'm not wearing
makeup just because it feels good and
just amazing things to your skin and
then for primer I'm using the cover FX
mattifying primer and I like this one
because it makes your skin feel like you
have less texture so if you have acne or
blemishes like that then you gotta try
that one out
I love the coverage of this foundation
but I feel like no matter how dark I go
I still look pale for some reason I
don't know it's just me and I love the
coverage and I'm going in with my Kat
Von D concealer and now I have this
really cool BB cream eyelid primer from
benefit I like the packaging in the
sponge tip or the little tip on it is so
like jelly and cool feeling I love it
I'm going to be using a new palette
today so I'm excited about that and
something energy nor clay palette from
the Tarte and I'm going to use this
color right here on the lid I'm going to
go in with my 239 it's just a flat
shader brush and place it all on the lid
and just really tap and just really pack
it in there
before my crease I'm going to use this
cool tone gray color right here and just
work it into the crease
I'm gonna deepen up the crease but I'm
gonna stick with the same color I'm
gonna go in with it again but with the
more dense brush and the denser your
brushes the more color payoff you're
going to get in that area so I'm going
to focus this on the crease and this is
the only color I love using right here
so I'm gonna pick up the color we used
on our lid and I'm gonna apply it to the
brow bone I'm gonna work it downwards
into the other color in the crease just
so everything looks smooth and nice and
party
so now it's liner time which is my
favorite time of my makeup I use Kat Von
D's tattoo liner that is my all-time
favorite right now I get a lot of
questions on it and this is the one I
use and that's pretty much that I look
now we're gonna apply some mascara this
is the makeup forever smoky extravagant
eyes that's what we're using on our
lashes and now I'm gonna apply some
falsies this is another favorite false
lash of mine I will have it linked in
the description box below you use my
velvet finish makeup forever powder in
the shade 5 and I'm just gonna set my
makeup in with this right here I'm gonna
use a little bit of my Manica dark
powder and c3 underneath my under eyes
just to brighten them up a little bit
more and add some coverage around there
I'm gonna contour with my trusty kat von
d palette and I got a lot of questions
on this brush right here
this is the TNT 200 brush I got it at
Fame Expo from TNT agency I try to look
for where you guys couldn't buy it but I
couldn't find it so if I do find it I
will put the link in the description box
below for you now it's time to fake
skinny I am going to define my features
make slim down my face a whole bunch
and now for the lippies I'm gonna take
my lip liner from Matt this is in spice
and I'm gonna over line my lips I'm
going for bigger juicy her lips today
and then I'm gonna go in with Mac's kind
of sexy lipstick and go right over it
and then on top of that one I'm taking
the Baum's
read my lips lip gloss in snap and then
I'm going back in with this moggy blush
from that same palette we used on our
eyes this is the look
