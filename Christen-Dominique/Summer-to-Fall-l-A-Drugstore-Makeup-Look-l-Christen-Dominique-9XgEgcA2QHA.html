can pick out some drugstore makeup for
our tutorial today hi everyone welcome
back to my channel today I'm doing a
drugstore makeup tutorial for you so you
can find these items super easy at your
local drugstore everything here except
for the brushes are drugstore but if you
don't have brushes you can definitely
use the applicator it was really fun to
create I was actually going for a fall
makeup look but then I found this pink
lipstick and it turned into something
else
this pink lipstick is definitely not
fall with the eyes you can definitely
just like throw on a nude or plum and
bam got a fall makeup look so I hope you
guys enjoy the tutorial to prime my face
i'm using the maybelline instant age
rewind primer and this is surprisingly
really good at mattifying and also
smoothing out the surface of my skin I
would highly recommend it and it reminds
me a lot of the bareMinerals prime time
primer it's just as good this Revlon
Colorstay foundation was my Holy Grail
foundation when I was younger it's like
putting on a mask because it covers
literally everything and but it would
break me out so bad and I totally forgot
about this until later on that day but
it covered so much and I was younger I
couldn't stop using it and it was super
affordable so this was the foundation
and honestly if it doesn't break me out
again I totally will continue using this
for like special events because man
that's like flawless and sorry if I
sound like a frog or a man but I'm super
sick right now for the concealer I'm
using the Revlon Colorstay and this
concealer works pretty good it covers
the redness but I honestly like the
thicker concealer so I probably won't be
using this one very often so I'm just
gonna Pat that around the dark areas and
around my under eyes and just Pat it in
with my finger
of course I forgot to pick up a eyebrow
pencil from the drugstore so I'm going
to use my cargo cosmetic brow defining
kit this actually you can get out of
drugstore I just don't think you can get
it here in California I think you can
get them in New York I'm going to fill
in the sparse areas of my brows and
enhance their natural shape
I already did my brows but I wanted to
let my foundation dry so I'm going back
to my face I'm going to use that the
Maybelline fit me powder in 225 that's
medium buff I'm going to take my large
fluffy brush this is full flawless face
from bareMinerals I'm just going to pack
it on the brush and
today I'm going to be using the
Maybelline expert wear eyeshadow quad in
sandstone shimmer and the first color
I'll be picking up is the cranberry
purple and I'm just going to wash this
color onto the crease so the next color
I'm using is this gold one and I'm going
to pack this on to the lid until it's
opaque which took a few Pat's honestly
but I finally got it to where I wanted
and then I blended it out with a clean
fluffy brush so that there is no harsh
line from the crease to the lid and now
I'm taking the darkest color in the
palette to form the outer V and create
some drama to our eyes after I create
the shape I want then I'm going to take
a clean brush to soften the edges of the
V
now I'm going to pick up the lightest
color in the palette to highlight my
brow bone and the inner corners and this
is just going to make our eyes look
brighter and bigger and really enhance
our eye shadow now I'm going to go back
into the cranberry purple color so that
we can create a halo effect around the
outer V to redefine the lower lash line
I'm going to take some of that brown
color and place it right along the lash
line and blend it out or the wing I'm
using the Loreal Lumiere intense liquid
liner which I will not be repurchasing
because the tip is sort of wide and
thick it didn't really let me
effortlessly create my wing so I give it
a thumbs down and will tell you that the
L'Oreal extra intense liquid pencil
liner is one of the best drugstore
liners out there and actually it beats
the higher-end liners too it's super
opaque and long-lasting so if you
haven't tried it I definitely recommend
that you try this little guy curling my
lashes because I'm going to apply my
mascara and this is the Maybelline
Pumped Up colossal mascara and I'm
applying a few coats of this to the top
and bottom lashes
here's the final I look now I'm gonna
move on to the cheeks for the cheeks I'm
using CoverGirl's classic color blush in
Rose silk and I put way too much product
on my brush so I took a new one in
feathered it out and toned it down a
little bit
moving on to the lips I'm using the
revlon colorburst in the color elusive
and I think this is the perfect look for
transition from summer to fall I hope
