black smokey eye when you're on the go
and you need something really fancy and
quick so I'm just using an eye pencil to
create this look and a little bit of
brown shadow in mascara I hope you guys
find it helpful and easy to do let's get
started the first thing that I'm going
to be using today is the Lord and berry
volute oh I pencil in 1801 vetto black
and we're going to line my upper lash
line using small strokes and you can
either create a sheer look or build up
the color for more of a sultry look
which is what I'll be doing today and
once I get the thickness I want I'm
going to flip the pencil to the smudger
side of the brush and I'm going to
smudge the color upwards this is going
to create more of a smoky look and it's
also going to soften the edges
and next I'm going to take this taupe
brown shadow and wash this onto the
crease to create depth on our eyes
for the highlight I'm using a matte bone
color I'm going to work that into the
brow bone and blend it downwards into
the other colors so that you get a soft
transition using the same color I'm
going to highlight the inner corners to
open up the eyes and make them appear
brighter next I'm using the luxury eye
pencil in number nine zero one it's
called in the black it's a twist up
pencil with a built-in sharpener super
convenient and I'm just going to apply
this to the lower waterline to add
definition and I'm going to smoke out
the lower lash line by grabbing the
smudger tip for my other liner and
smudging the edges next I'm taking the
Lord and berry mask our mascara and this
is going to enhance the volume and
definition of your lashes and also adds
length so I'm just going to start at the
tip and then wiggle upwards and same
with the bottom lashes just starting at
the tip and wiggling downwards and for
this look I'm going to add a warmth to
my face by just adding a matte contour
color to the hollow areas and also using
this as a blush and since the eyes are
so dramatic I'm just going to take a
nude lipstick to finish the look thank
