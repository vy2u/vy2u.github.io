around once more
notice me
mom crazy boy
hi everyone welcome back to my channel
today I am doing a sweater weather
makeup and outfit video for you guys I
love this time of year it's my favorite
this is a time where I get out my
pumpkin spice lattes and I start
drinking more peppermint mochas holidays
in a cup and this is the time when I
start wearing a bunch of sweaters so I
wanted to do a makeup tutorial that was
inspired by sweater weather something
that's really cozy and warm that's where
this makeup tutorial came about so I
hope you guys enjoy the video hi
everybody
let's get started with this makeup
tutorial but I can't start without my
coffee
slender weather actually had a
peppermint mocha this morning but I
finished it now I'm on to the vinda what
is it now I'm on to the French vanilla
okay to start my makeup off I'm going to
use a primer this is from bare minerals
you guys normally see me use their
minerals prime time in medium but this
one is a neutral neutralizing yeah
that's my first time using the
neutralizing one it's probably way
lighter and oh it's yellow so I'm
thinking this one probably just cancels
out like the darker under-eye circles so
I'm just going to apply that with my
clean finger oh this is really yellow
I'm really interested to see how this is
going to turn out oh my gosh
smells interesting
like a banana
I think I did a pretty nice job at
evening out my skin tone so I'm happy
with it but it's not better than my
medium one so for my foundation I'm
using Smashbox Studios skin in a two
point four I'm going to use my zoeva Oh
Sigma 3d HD kabuki brush now I'm going
to cover up my under-eye circles and I'm
just going to use this is the Smashbox
concealer in fair light I just apply
this one right below my under eye circle
I think the darkest part in my under-eye
area is actually the inner corner like
right underneath the inner corner that's
usually the darkest sometimes you can
even get away with just putting
concealer right in this small area here
and oh it'll look a lot better now that
I've evened out my complexion I'm just
going to let that dry and start on my
brows where the brows I'm using my M
arched my old trusty so the first color
I'm going to pick up is this warm tan
matte shade from the balm in the color
sultry I'm just going to wash this onto
my crease and a lower lash line using a
fluffy brush next I'm going to pick up
the color stand offish this is a frosty
peachy beige color and I'm just going to
apply that to the inner half of the lid
and then I'm picking up the color
selfish and it is a frosted taupe color
and I'm just going to apply that to the
outer half of the lid I'm going to add
some definition to the shape of my eyes
so I'm going to pick up this matte black
color with a pencil brush and just work
it into the outer V
with a clean fluffy brush I'm going to
now just blend out the edges and with
the same color on the pencil brush we're
just going to line the lower half of the
bottom lashline so now I'm just going in
with the Smashbox concealer under my
eyes to brighten them up and I'm
blending it out with a concealer buffer
brush from zoeva and this is in the
number 142
for my brow bone highlight I'm actually
using a concealer here this is the
honest Asya concealer on 1.5 it's a
little thicker and then I'm blending it
down into the other colors with that
concealer buffer brush from zoeva I just
like the way it makes everything look
really smooth now I'm just gonna use my
favorite eyeliner this is from the bomb
and Schwing Schwing I can't say that
right Schwing and I'm going to wing out
my top lash line
to add definition to my eyes I'm going
to line my waterline with the graphic
eyes from zoeva in the color desert
traveler and I'm going to bring that all
the way into the inner corner next I'm
going to add the Urban Decay perversion
mascara to my lashes and I'm going to
just apply generous coats to the top and
bottom lashes
for my lashes today I'm going to use my
current favorite lashes they're from
angel contacts and these are in dolly
TRS I just got some new ones in and I'm
super excited for them for my lashes I
usually do the same technique I just
plop them on to the center of the lash
line and then I take my tweezers and I
just attach one side at a time usually
the inner corner then the outer corner
of the eye and just to make sure there
isn't any glue marks I go back over with
an eyeliner to set my makeup I'm going
to use my cargo HD powder and this is in
number 25 to set my under eye makeup I'm
just going to take the honest Aussie
powder the yellow one and to go
alongside the nose and in this little
crease here
go out all the way in the tops of the
cheekbones
I feel like doing an under eye highlight
just makes you look more plump and
youthful and gonna do alongside of my
mouth - you have these dark lines going
on the side so I'm just going to fill
that in - I'm going to just put this
matte banana powder down this bridge of
my nose and right in the center of my
forehead and now I'm just going to
contour a little bit I'm going to take
my zoeva face paint brush and this is in
109 and just one of these contour
powders Oh
for the blush I'm using the city color
be matte blush and fresh melon
I'm just going to go over my forehead
right in this area where that light
would hit with the blush to give my face
a warmer look and then I'm just going to
blend everything out with the matte 188
rush today for the lips I'm using my
Gerard cosmetics cherry cordial when I
saw this I was like for sure this is
going to be a sweater weather lip color
this color reminds me of cranberries
it's a really nice matte color and it
makes my teeth look whiter that's always
a good thing and this is the final look
I hope you guys enjoy the video
