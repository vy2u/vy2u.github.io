today I am gonna show you how to make
sure that your makeup does not move like
stiff as a board like a statue you can
go swimming in it you can sweat at the
gym I don't know why you'd look this
glam at the gym but why not your makeups
not going anyway I promise you or if you
have extremely oily skin like extremely
oily skin this is for you but I am also
going to show you this super bronzed
look my eyes are bronze my face is
bronze bronze highlight on right now
that is super super poppin and I also
have some bronze lips you want to learn
how to get this super bronzy look then
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
and hit that notification bell see to be
part of the quad family and without
further ado let's get on with the video
I'm gonna start on my brows first just
because that's like the first thing I
like to do just to shape my face I feel
like my face has no shape without my
brows I'm gonna start here with the brow
powder and shade number five benefit
foolproof so what I like to do kind of
like the same thing with my eyeliner I
always like to go the opposite direction
so I'm gonna hold my angled brush like
this if you guys have trouble definitely
try this technique because it is super
helpful once my brows are filled in I've
been filling them in this way lately I
go ahead I can't just leave my brows
bare like that I have to bring in some
hair so I just go and make little hairs
and then comb through it just to smudge
it out and make it look more like brow
hairs if I have any likes really intense
sparse areas and they're still pretty
bald I'll just fill them in and this is
such a light color I always have to do
my brows first it just makes me feel
like okay I have a face shape so now I'm
gonna get into the primer so I'm gonna
take the Smashbox X of lotta petal metal
primer yeah it is I'm just gonna press
it into my skin it feels like very
mattifying but it still gives you that
glow so I'm gonna put it all over my
face we're just gonna be glowing to the
gods today now we are a rose gold disco
ball and I'm
to go I'm gonna go ahead and use this
hydrating primer as well on top of it so
this is from Smashbox there are my
ultimate favorite primers so I'm gonna
go ahead and use this one right here the
hydrating primer this is one of my
definite favorites because of my skin
being super dry so I'm gonna go right
over the top just because that rose gold
primer it felt extremely extremely
mattifying and I already have really dry
skin so I mean I want the glow all right
so now I'm gonna go into the foundation
foundation for this wet proof makeup is
going to be a very high coverage matte
foundation this is from ziwei it's the
color almond so I'm gonna go ahead and
take my Beauty Blender like so and work
that on my skin as you can see it does
an amazing job at covering all your
imperfections like on your face I'm
actually just gonna put this on my
eyelids as well just so we can even them
out and everything is nice and even all
right so I'm gonna prime my eyes with
some concealer this is actually a
concealer I'm gonna use later on for my
under eye circles this is the Urban
Decay all nighter waterproof will
coverage concealer so I'm gonna go ahead
and put that on my eyelids and this type
of concealer is great to use as a primer
because it is waterproof so usually when
something's waterproof it's not gonna
crease on you as much I'm just gonna pop
it in with my Beauty Blender so for my
eyes today I'm gonna go in with the
Kylie bronze extended palette which
looks like so inside oh my god it's so
beautiful so I'm just gonna use this
bone color right here like so it looks
like this very very pigmented as you
guys can see I'm gonna take that bone
color and just set the eyes in place and
it's just a light the dust of the shadow
you're not going in super heavy with it
and the next color we'll pick up is this
one right here this really pretty bronze
and I'm gonna work that in the crease
okay I'm gonna go underneath my eye with
the same bronze color with this flower
small brush right here then I'm gonna go
in with this color right here this
reddish shade and go right underneath
alright so I'm gonna use the same color
and do the same technique just layer it
right underneath I'm not gonna go in as
far I'm just gonna kind of play with it
on the outside and we are looking pretty
bronzy right now what I've been doing
lately to blend out the harsh edges I
don't change my brush and I find that it
works really well and then with that
amount of pressure I'm just going in
circular motions in it blends like a
dream now I'm gonna go in a little bit
deeper into the bronze palette I'm gonna
take this the darkest shade right here
mama needs this Asante brush it's called
the contour eyeshadow for and then I'm
just gonna go in right here and start to
bring in that definition I'm gonna start
to work that dark brown on the outer
corner I just want to get that color
kind of washed into the outer corner and
what I'm gonna actually do is take this
orange shade in the palette just to
bring in some more of like a warm tone
in there on top of everything we just
did I'm trying to decide if I want to
use this color here or this one I'm
gonna add it around the eye actually
gonna bring it in right in here to
really bring a different look to the eye
make it a little bit more dramatic that
was exactly what we needed right there
so I decided for the eye lid I'm gonna
take this beautiful beautiful bronze
color was calling my name as soon as I
saw it
let's do this so I'm gonna take that
beautiful copper color I'm going back in
with the darkest brown in the palette
just to really define the crease and
give the eye a little bit more
definition with this densely-packed tiny
little brush I'm gonna take the darkest
color you have those soft colors going
through so having this defined line
right here will make it look super Grady
and smooth and just perfect okay then
I'm gonna go in with this angled brush
right here
and I'm gonna use the darkest color and
Mesa as an eyeliner on my eye I've been
loving using eye shadow eyeliner lately
I don't do like super harsh lines I'll
just kind of
get out a little bit I'm gonna take this
gold color right here I'm gonna pop it
on finish popping it on to the inner
corners I just feel like a shiny rustic
penny does that make sense
shiny and rustic we're done with the
eyes I'm gonna go ahead and use some of
this water-resistant mascara from the
bomb the bomb has some of the most bomb
products no pun intended
I love they're like everything I love
their bronzers all of their blushes but
today I'm just using their mascara and
this happens to be waterproof it's a
really good one so I'm just gonna pop it
on my eyes it's just prepping my eyes
for lashes for lashes I'm gonna take
these Lily lashes in Bella
so now I'm just gonna clean up the
eyeshadow right here with some concealer
and also hide these dark circles and
highlight my face and then I'm actually
gonna put some on some concealer on this
brush and clean up that way just because
it's gonna be a little too harsh if you
put it on right then and there and I
want to make sure that this is super
full coverage so I'm gonna let the
concealer kind of just sit there for a
second
to set my under eyes and actually to set
my whole entire face I'm gonna use this
technique this is a sweat proof
technique we do have a lot of
water-resistant things on our face
already I'm gonna set my under eyes and
my entire face with dermablend I have
one that's light or translucent but I
still feel like it gives you it really
brightens your under eyes and then to
bake the rest of my face I'm actually
gonna bake my entire base I'm gonna take
the cool tone beige now I'm just going
to work it in work some of it in and
then the rest like right under the eyes
we haven't really heavy with it after I
do that as of recently I have really
been loving pressed powder over the
baking so I take my laundry Beauty won
this is my favorite favorite one it's a
very full coverage and I'm just gonna
press that right underneath and I
promise you your makeup is not going to
come off I'm gonna contour a little bit
with the shade and light palette from
Kat Von D these more cool tone shades to
really give that natural dimension we're
back with just a little bit more mascara
on the lower lashes to add some drama
into our life and now I'm going to
bronze my face with a waterproof bronzer
from Tarte they always have waterproof
everything for the face and I really
love that and then I'm gonna take this
highlight right here from persona
cosmetics
it's the cali glow highlighter in Del
Mar it's super bronzy and I thought this
would be perfect for this look I mean it
just takes some on my finger and go
right on my nose and then I'm just gonna
put it right on my Cupid's bow okay I'm
gonna take Mac's
stripped down and line my lips and then
I'm going to take the coup de Beauty
liquid lip and girlfriends I'm gonna
take the Hank and Henry lip lustre gloss
and presidential so to finish off the
look I'm gonna spritz on this Urban
Decay all nighter spray and this is also
gonna make all the powder on her face
turn to skin like texture again this is
really just like insurance for your
makeup it's not going to budge at all
and that is the completed look we're
right here
