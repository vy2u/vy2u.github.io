guys welcome back to my channel so today
I'm gonna be showing you how to get this
sweat proof this water proof
long-lasting makeup that will not come
off until you take it off
also I cut my hair in case you guys
didn't notice on my Instagram I did cut
my hair and I colored it darker thank
you Eric thank you eglee those are my
stylist and my colorist I'll have a link
below in case you're wondering but I
love my new hair and I found out a way
to style it and I'm very excited to show
you guys how I did this
my style is showed me how to do it and I
wanted to share it with you guys and let
you know if you are wanting to go short
or for the summer I think it's a great
super easy and quick if you want to
learn how to get this look and this hair
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
and hit that notification bells to give
you a part of the quad family and
without further ado we're gonna get on
okay before we get into the hair I'm
gonna do the makeup first so starting
off with this SPF rx
ultra clear daily skin hydrator it has
an SPF of 50 which is awesome and is
great for the summertime you meet your
skin needs that protection to stay young
beautiful gorgeous and flawless this is
actually from this month's glam bag I'm
gonna be using a few of these glam bag
products in this video today so you'll
notice that some of them are like this
tiny like this guy it's because they're
from the glam bag this season my bag
right here I've never used this before
but it sounds pretty good and supposed
to help with redness and calming this
skin which is awesome because my skin is
always a little irritated a little red
actually it's a less red today which is
awesome and I think it looks pretty good
today
it's really important to hydrate your
skin if you don't have an SPF to put on
if it's in your makeup that works too
you just want to make sure your skin is
protected before you get out into the
Sun and start sweating everything else
off except for your makeup because we
have this video today alright so let's
get into the foundation the foundation
that I'm choosing to use today is from
decay this is the all-nighter waterproof
long wear liquid foundation just wanna
make sure I got the name right
I had a burp sorry this is in the shade
six and this one I know for sure isn't
going to come off of your face
this will stay all day this is a more
full coverage foundation if you are in
the Sun and you want your skin to
breathe I would go for a BB or CC cream
you guys know my favorite one comment
below if you know if I'm going for a
glam look or if I just want my skin to
look extra flawless I'll go ahead and
use this guy right here because it is
waterproof just in case I taste some by
a pool and I have water splashing
everywhere or I'm by the beach and I'm
taking pictures for you know Instagram
or something then we want our skin to
look super flawless so this is the guy
for you if you were wanting to look
extra flawless on this sunny hot sweaty
days sounds gross I'm gonna go ahead and
pop this onto my skin my hand is
basically my pallet I use it for
everything so I'm gonna keep my Beauty
Blender which is down down there on the
side in a makeup bag I'll be right back
have my Beauty Blender right here it
looks dirty but honestly it is a little
dirty so I'm gonna go ahead and pop this
onto my face you don't eat a lot with
this because it is a full coverage
foundation it's easily gonna cover any
and everything on your face so don't go
crazy with it I sometimes have the
tendency to go overboard with my
foundations because the inner cake
inside a few dabs right on the cheeks on
the chin and right on the forehead and
I'm just gonna dab it into my skin I
always tell you guys if you want the
most coverage out of your product make
sure to use very light patting motions
but with this I really don't care for
the coverage I just want it to last all
day so I'm going to go in and beat the
face just like this actually works as a
concealer too because it's so thick and
full coverage you can use it to cancel
out the redness in your eyes you can use
it to cover those dark circles if you
don't want to go over with a concealer
because this thing is very very
pigmented see how red my eyes are I
don't know why I guess it's hereditary
and go ahead and bring it up in here I
usually bring it into my hair I wouldn't
suggest you do
try to avoid the hair it's a mistake
that I always do with this foundation
like I said you can skip the concealer
and use this as a concealer
contemplating keeping that even look
rather than the bright under eyes so I'm
going to add a little bit more to my
hand and just dab it right under my eyes
and because I want more coverage under
my eyes this is where I'm going to use a
lighter hand
so I'm barely patting it into my face so
I can get the most out of the foundation
for the brows I'm going to use my
precisely my brow pencil from benefit it
is in the shade number three and I'm
gonna go a little bit lighter today just
because I feel like I have been going
very dark lately I kind of want to try
something different so I'm gonna go
ahead and comb through the brows just in
case I have any foundation in them which
I know I do
cuz look at this gray okay I just want
to see what shape we can create with
this well darken up the tail ends of the
brow after we're done I'm just gonna
follow the natural growth of my hair so
right in this direction this is a really
nice pencil if you want to get into a
precise area of your brow and create
those sharp lines or those hair like
strokes because it is so tiny and narrow
so I'm gonna go in with shade number
four this is the goof proof brow pencil
this one's better at getting through the
entire brow hair if you want more of a
narrow stroke you can also flip it on
this side and it has a more narrow point
to it okay the eye shadow look that I'm
gonna go for today is very simple I'm
gonna take this palette right here this
is from kg Beauty it's called the
mermaid palette and I'm gonna take this
one shade they have it in this palette
that is so gorgeous it's this one right
here this is Sienna now first I'm gonna
start at the crease and you are going to
notice this is very orange but I like it
so I'm going to go back and forth and
windshield wiper motions kind of using a
heavier hand towards the outer part of
the eye I'm also going to bring it down
on it to the
I'm gonna top it in there really close
to the base of the lashes so you don't
have that gap there
the next color for the crease that I'm
using is this guy right here this is
from Luna
by Luna cosmetics this is the shade Jace
and it's one of those natural colored
shadows that are going to give you the
definition that natural definition that
you need in the crease if you put it
next to your face you're going to think
that it's not going to do much for you
but it does so much with helping create
that gradient on your eye and just
making everything look smooth and
transition very nicely this is supposed
to be one of those long lasting formulas
and it also is supposed to be very
pigmented let's try this guy out and see
how pigmented it is and I'm gonna work
that right into the crease just going
right back and forth and windshield
wiper motions and yes it is very
pigmented this is gonna help give you
that warm unique rosy undertone that I
want to create on my eye today I'm gonna
go back and forth into this guy and then
I'm gonna pick up more of the Sienna and
mesh those together so they could be
married and live happily ever after
so I'm loving this sunset happening on
my eye right now I'm gonna go ahead and
take this Makeup Forever aqua XL color
paint in the shade 142 or I forty two so
I'm gonna take it on my palate aka the
back of my hand so it looks like this
comes in like a little lip balm to has a
nice metallic bronze look to it I'm
gonna use my finger to dab a little bit
on to the center of the lid I want the
eye to have that little bit of shine in
the center but I don't want it to go
overboard and take over the entire lid
now it really looks like the Sun is
setting on my eyes where the liner I'm
gonna go in with this scone liner right
here this is from Scone cosmetics this
is the insanely intense tattooed
waterproof eyeliner in jet black I'm
gonna use this to create that wing on
our eye that's sexy cat eye it has a
felt tip applicator on it for me these
guys are easier to apply that wing oh
it's very black very intense exactly
what it says right and same
and as I get closer to the inner corner
the dinner liner is going to get you
guys that eyeliner is so good I
definitely will be using it again it is
very pigmented I'm gonna take that eye
shadow that we used earlier in the
crease pop that on to the lower lash
line just to add some dimension there
now I'm gonna go into my waterline with
this gold pencil right here this is from
beauty for real
the eye line 24/7 eyeliner in 24 karat
and this is also waterproof so it's
going to last on your eyes especially in
the waterline I feel like it's so
important to have a waterproof pencil
okay so I'm loving the pop of gold
that's happening on my eyes right now
I'm gonna go into the mascara to really
bring out the look so this next mascara
is also something that is sweat proof
water-resistant
it's the deuce a Mac / volumizer mascara
in black this is a mascara that's
supposed to be very creamy buildable and
long-lasting as well okay so I'm just
gonna pop on some lashes and I'm gonna
use these House of lashes lashes and
noir fairy light okay so I'm running
really low on my lash glue and I found
this one the huda beauty lash glue fast
drying waterproof flash adhesive the
lashes are on I'm gonna move on with
setting everything in place and the way
I like to set things in place is by
adding powder so I add powder and a
little bit of setting spray and I'm done
take these two shades right here pop
them underneath my eyes and then start
to set my under eyes so now I'm gonna
use the contours in this palette I'm
gonna go in with this shade right here
terracotta so I'm gonna go into desert
Paulo out this cheekbone so we have a
nice sharp cheek and in case you had too
many cheeseburgers go ahead and carve
out that jawline and right underneath
your chin I don't know if you guys know
this but if you don't know if you're
eating bad or not just look at your
double chin it will always tell you all
the back and foods go here I get that
very often so I'm have to contour my
jawline right here and right underneath
my chin
for the bronzer I'm going to use this
Tarte Amazonian clay matte waterproof
bronzer in Park Avenue princess and pop
that onto my cheeks anywhere that I want
to look more bronzy and glowy but a
different kind of glow where the blush
I'm gonna go in with this the balm
cosmetics balm Springs along wearing
blush in the shade bomb Springs so this
is a really nice earth rose tone blush
that complements a lot of different skin
tones and it lasts all day and just work
that onto my cheeks so we can have a
nice healthy natural-looking flesh of
color I'm gonna go for something simple
and sexy I'm going to go for a gloss
today this is from the Santi it is the
power all's lip gloss in supermom and
I'm just gonna put this on my lips it's
made with natural oils so it's gonna
help hydrate your lips and heal them if
they're cracked or sore
okay so that is it for the makeup I'm
gonna move on to the hair cuz the hair
is loose looking kind of crazy I'm gonna
show you how I style my new lob section
it off I have my little clip with me
right here I'm just gonna clip it up so
I have this right here this is the belt
one of the Bellamy tools and straighten
with it and you can also do small curls
with it and what I like to do first is
make sure that everything is nice and
straight and there's no parts flipping
outwards like a duck so what I'll do is
go to the longer pieces in the front and
I'll start waving the hair by bringing
it around like this I'll hold it up
count to like five seconds because this
gets really hot and just just bring it
through slightly like that and let it go
you get this little bitty curl in your
hair at the very top and I just take it
around the entire head and I'll do this
I don't like doing them all the same way
so if I curl it away from my face on the
next piece I'll curl towards my face try
not to burn yourself it gives your hair
more volume definition texture my hair
is very dark so I need all the texture
that I can get I'm going to take down
another section if you want a bigger
curl you can also just hold it like this
and wrap it around your head
which is what I'm going to do for the
back of the hair
I'm gonna start teasing the rest of my
hair comb give this guy up a little bit
just to fluff it up just soft little
motions with your brush and then I'm
gonna go right underneath it and create
that lift the more lifts the better I
like when my hair has a lot of volume so
I don't lose what I've already done I'm
just gonna clip this part and let down
some hair that I want to work with and
this is basically the top of my hair but
I have a little bit too much going on so
I'm gonna pick up this piece right here
so I'm gonna use the entire barrel and
I'm gonna curl away from my face leaving
this whole piece out right here because
I don't want it to be curled now that we
have these guys curled I'm gonna add
some volume to them by brushing them up
there I'm gonna take it right underneath
just curl it away
now I'm going to do is take the
straightener and go through the pieces
make sure none of them are sticking out
words I want all the ends to be straight
so go ahead and spray some texturizing
spray this is the way texturizing
hairspray and I'll just go through fluff
the hair up take little pieces I really
love this hairstyle it's super easy it's
messy you don't have to be too perfect
with it which is great for my skills I
