welcome back to my channel so today I'm
going to be showing you a sweat proof
very long-lasting makeup look that you
can wear in a spring or the summer has a
pop of color in there and it's really
fresh and pretty so if you want to learn
how to get it then keep watching I was
eating hot cheetos last night talk to
you and I think the only reason I was
doing that it was because Cesar was not
with me so now this is stain and I can't
sleep by myself so I grabbed hot cheetos
and beamed it so if you want your makeup
to last super long I think everybody
knows you need to start off with a
primer so I'm going to be using this
murad invisiblur perfecting shield
primer has a SPF of 30 which is great
for this summer and so I'm just going to
put some on my hand and I talked about
this in my last video it's one of my
favorite primers because it fills in all
those pores just makes your foundation
glide on really nice and even so after
I'm done with that I go ahead and I take
my makeup forever mist and fix I'm going
to let that dry for a little bit before
I start applying all my foundation I
find if you apply your setting spray
before you start your makeup it lasts so
much longer for my foundation I'm going
to use the Tarte Amazonian clay full
coverage foundation this is a 12-hour
foundation so that's why I love this in
the summer it's absolutely amazing it
makes you it fills in and hides
everything so that's why I love this and
it has a SPF of 15 sunscreen on it I'm
going to take my Beauty Blender my clean
and Beauty Blender I just cleaned it
last night it feels so good to have a
nice clean Beauty Blender I'm going to
put a little bit of this on my hand and
just work it in to my face my face is
always way lighter than my body the way
I would match my foundation is by using
your neck as a guide to the color and if
it like completely disappears like you
can't even tell I have it on my neck
then you know it's the right color
for my under eyes I'm going to use the
naked skin weightless complete coverage
concealer from urban decay in light
neutral
more recently it's been it's been a
habit for me to start really close to
the inner corner because I feel like
that's where it's the darkest you
brighten this part up and then just say
doubt everything else it looks a lot
more natural so I'm going to do some
contouring I'm going to take my
foundation stick for makeup forever just
do a little bit of contouring on the
cheeks and the nose I'm blending with
the smaller side of my DD blender and
then I'm just like patting it moving it
upwards you don't want to move it down
because then you're going to look like
you have a five o'clock shadow and I'm
not trying to be a man today I'm not
going to set my creams yet just because
I want to clean anything up on my eye
I'll wipe it away and it'll look like
nothing ever happened for my eyes for my
eyebrows I'm going to use I'm so excited
to show you guys this this is the
benefit precisely my brow pencil oh my
god you guys this is so good it's
exactly what it says it's super precise
it's so tiny and the good thing about
this is that it's at last 24 hours on
your brows so you can literally get them
wet they will still be on your eyes so
I'm going to start at the bottom of my
brow and just focus on creating shape at
the bottom and then feather it upward
I'm gonna put this brow gel on my
eyebrow called Co brow I'm in number 5
just looks like this it's a gel and this
is the wand and I've never liked a one
or the brow brush on any like set that
comes together like this I feel like the
brush is always off but this one is
perfect it's really skinny and it just
fits in the area is really nice I'm just
gonna fill in my brows I'm just going to
clean underneath my brow a little bit so
I'm taking a little bit of concealer and
this morphe 43 brush they made any
mistakes this is a really good way to
clean line underneath the brow before I
apply my eyeshadow I'm going to use some
of the shadow insurance from Too Faced
this is the 24 hour anti-crease shadow
insurance right now and taking a little
bit with my finger the first shadow that
I'm going to use is this color tattoo
24-hour shadow stick this is from
Maybelline and it's in the color creamy
chocolate and just going to put it on
all over my eyelid a little messy when
you first put it on but you blend it out
with your finger and it looks good
blending it out blending the edges with
my finger
I'm lending upwards towards the brow
bone all right so then I'm going to go
ahead and take soft brown from match
this is the M for three three four more
feet and work it on top of the color
tattoo
so I'm going to go ahead and go back in
with my 24-hour put a little bit on my
lower lash line try to keep it really
close to your lashes just using an
angled brush because I can't find my
smudger brush so I'm just going to do
that
I'm going to take this brush right here
this is a bareMinerals precision I brush
I'm going to take this smaller end and
work it into my soft brown Mac shadow
and blend it right on top of the color
tattoo anytime you put a powder on top
of a cream it's going to really stick to
your face so for the center of my lids
I'm going to take Naked Lunch from Matt
just pop it onto the center give a
little light to the eye
just going in back in with that brush we
used for soft brown I feel like a little
bit of the shadow just got taken away so
I'm gonna bring it back in there I
didn't add more to the brush I just
using the same brush with the same
amount of products on it now for the fun
part I'm going to use the aqua XL I
pencil for a makeup forever this really
pretty blue colored m26 I'm gonna put it
on my waterline and just my waterline
because this can get a little crazy
really really fast and just bring down
my waterline
so what I decided to do is take this
tart clay pot in unicorn kisses and I'm
applying it right over the liner just so
it's really intensely blue and I'm using
my winged liner brush from Sigma the eo6
brush because it's like super tiny at
the end I'm already done with my the
blue liner I'm going to go ahead and
take the color tattoo and the this 317
winged liner brush from zoeva and I'm
going to just draw right underneath this
line just so that it looks a little bit
more crisp unique okay now I'm just
going to create a wing on my lash line
for mascara I'm going to use the Too
Faced better than sex waterproof mascara
cutest mascara ever made the cutest tube
of mascara I have ever seen in my life
because there's little water droplets on
it okay so I'm going to take these lily
lashes in Miami I'm going to apply them
to my eyeballs they're really pretty and
fluffy so to put on my lash I just take
my tweezers hold it in the center of the
lash and then I come from up top this I
just drop them down push it back and
touch one side at a time
and then I just pinched the real and
fleshly false lash together yep that's
pretty much it
for the eyes I am done with the eyes now
I'm going to go back to the face so now
I'm just going to set everything in
place I'm going to take my Kat Von D
lock a tattoo powder foundation this is
in medium 53 and I like to load up the
brush on the sides just Pat it in there
and then go go in like on the front
so next I'm going to bronze up my face
I'm going to take the Urban Decay beach
bronzer and sunkissed looks like that
and I'm going to use this brush right
here this is an angled brush from TNT
I'm going to take it around the temples
and right on top of the cheekbone so for
the blush I'm going to use these Tarte
blushes because they are 12 our lasting
blushes I'm going to take captivating
which is a peachy shade right here some
take this one I like to use a stippling
brush to put on my blush just because
it's puts on the lightest amount and you
can really control how much and I like
to keep it behind the apples of my
cheeks just so that looks a little bit
more natural the only thing we have left
are the lips so for the lips I'm going
to use back subcultura lipliner first
and then after that I'm going to go
ahead and take my obsessive compulsive
cosmetics OCC lip tar and digital lists
really pretty pink I'm going to put it
on I'm going to put a little bit on
because this is very very pigmented so
I'm going to go a little bit along way
and then I'm going to just apply the
Omni liquid lipstick from Jeffrey star
on my lips same thing with this it's
very pigmented I'm going to add a little
bit of a highlight this is the Sophia
star powder from Gerard cosmetics just
going to take this fan brush just put a
little bit right here right on top of
the cheekbone
all right so I'm almost done but first I
have to seal my face and see makeup
forever
mist and fix that we started off with
now we have to end with it so that your
makeup doesn't budge it doesn't taste
good and that's it this is the final
