getting in my mouth a little bit and I'm
not mad at it hey guys welcome back to
my channel so today we are comparing
high rated versus low rated makeup of
course I split my face into two I saw
this video floating around from
rachhloves high rated low rated makeup
so I'm like you know what I'm gonna put
them all in one video and compare them
and really see if they are high and low
rated or if these should not be low
rated and you guys is crazy you guys can
compare with me I just want to see what
it looks like on my face you may even
find dupes pause on this video and let
me know which side is high and which
side is low just let me know we're gonna
see what worked what didn't can you tell
there is no secret there's no hiding it
one side sucks one sides bomb and let's
just get on with this video before we
get into the video don't forget to
subscribe to my channel and hit that
notification bell so you could be a part
of the quad family and without further
ado I'm gonna get you straight in to
this video alright the first product we
are gonna start with is foundation so I
did my research and the best foundation
on Sephora right now is the Estee Lauder
Double Wear which I completely
understand why one of my old favorites I
definitely understand why it's still
everyone else's favorite the coverage is
amazing so this is one of the top-rated
foundations it's $42 know if this is my
shade anymore because my tan is almost
faded completely but I feel like I can
definitely still make it work so I'm
gonna just work that into my neck one
thing we definitely know about this
foundation is that it is full coverage
you can tell from this side to this side
that the coverage is on point
most of everyone loves the full coverage
on this foundation it's long wearing it
doesn't transfer anywhere throughout the
day so that is a huge plus and it's just
super matched so if you have oily skin
this foundation is great
me personally I have dry to normal skin
so sometimes I feel like it is a little
bit too dry but you can easily fix that
with putting on a moisturizing primer or
just a really good moisturizer
underneath I totally go back to this
from
time but it's been a while since I've
been back to this location right here
when it's more of a Matt I feel like it
just makes my skin look softer and more
filtered so I don't mind that at all the
only thing about this is that it does
oxidize a little bit you might go a
little shade lighter than what you think
you are but most people seem not to care
about that too much because it's so
freakin good in full coverage and I am
not mad about it the lowest-rated
foundation on Sephora right now is this
guy right here this is the bare minerals
bare skin foundation in my shade is bare
natural 0/7 it was reviewed by over
2,000 people almost 3000 people and it
was all mostly really negative and they
did mention this is $18 foundation by
the way most people did not like the
design of the bottle because it is kind
of messy because you have to shake it
the product moves around a lot and
because the product is very watery kind
of it gets everywhere it didn't get
everywhere right now but when I was
testing it out at the store it
definitely was super messy the product
was coming out of the bottle so a lot of
people said that he wastes a lot of
product with this bottle design and I
could see why because there is a huge
gaping hole right there and it's a very
watery kind of product that you do have
to shake but I also noticed that if you
don't close it properly because you have
to hear this click it's not really
getting anywhere and I'm gonna flip it
upside down so maybe it's people not
closing the bottle right this is a very
light light light light formula wow that
feels like nothing at all it's evening
out my complexion honestly right I don't
like how wet it's making my skin look
still and I feel like it just emphasizes
more of my texture honestly not my
favorites alright so moving on to the
brows I found that the Dior brows Tyler
was highly rated in Sephora and that
made me really happy because I actually
already used this and I loved it so
freaking much because it's just easy
portable there's just something about
this pencil that is just so perfect
it has just
enough pigmentation it's easy to move
around your brow it's not stiff its
smooth and has a spoolie on it the color
it just meshes really well with my brow
I just really love this pencil so it
made me really happy that this was
highly rated and that I already had it
and I didn't have to spend the money on
it so I was really excited about that
but I really do love this pencil there
there are so many good things I can say
about it and the reviews were insane it
just glides on your skin it's so easy
it's easy to blend into your hair
there's just something about this pencil
that works in every single way possible
I'm going to move on to the lowest-rated
side of my face it sounds so bad this is
the NARS brow Perfector and the shade I
cannot pronounce which I can never
really pronounce much of the beautiful
names that Norah's has for their
products but this is spelled caucus
ass this is a 3 star rated product it is
$24 and let's go ahead and try this on
our face most people said that this was
hard and stiff and there is no color
payoff I would say because there's um
this is the darkest shade that they have
I would agree that there needs to be a
darker shade but I feel like you can see
the color it's just not as pigmented as
you'd like really I guess I'm not really
feeling this much because it's just not
really doing much to my brow but if I
clean it up and keep going back in
hoping that at all
build up okay something else that I'm
gonna does seeing back to the foundation
is that it's super patchy right now my
face it's just clumping up in little
spots around my face oh that is not good
especially on my forehead nose and
around my mouth I just feel really old
on this side I'm trying to get as much
pigment as I can out of this it's just
too light for me I understand this was a
fail alright so the highest rated
Sephora eyeshadow palette you guys ready
for this and I'm so excited about this
because it's an indie brand I'm very
proud of this
dbrand I remember when they were just
glitter so here we go
the violent Vasa pro-rider die palette
is one of the top-rated palettes this is
a $75 palette but it has so many
freaking eyeshadows in it you see this
transition shimmers day to night file a
boss has really nice quality shadows
this is a for almost a five-star product
this is 4.9 stars that's really really
high
I totally understand why this palette is
so amazing and I have to make sure that
the look that I'm doing can correlate
with this other palette that I'm going
to show you guys and it actually it
correlates like there's cool tone taupey
shades that it's going to work perfectly
with so it literally has everything from
warm to cool I love it so I'm gonna
first go in with setting my lid I'm
gonna take April right here a lot of
people just love the pigmentation on
this palette they love that it blends so
easy the feel it's creamy so I
definitely agree I'm gonna take Skylar
which is this really pretty taupe ishe
dry here's topi gray color I'm gonna go
in with Jamie which is this shade right
here so creamy so pigmented all the
things all the good things with this
palette
those are really pretty coated so I'm
gonna take the black in the palette
which is right here her name is Cara Lee
then I'm gonna just clean up the brow
area so for that I'm gonna take April
again the lowest rated product in
Sephora and I was honestly surprised I
haven't used this palette much but I'm
very curious to see why people aren't
loving it because the color scheme is
really nice so the eyeshadow that I am
talking about is this one right here
this is the Smashbox full exposure as
you can see it's something that I
already had and I dug it up just
realized that I really didn't use it
much and I don't remember why I didn't
use a much because the color scheme is
really nice so this palette is $52 and a
lot of people are just saying there's
just no pigment no pigment no color
payoff now
things so I'm really curious to see how
it's gonna work for me a lot of people
said there's a lot of fallout with the
pallet let's go ahead jump in and see
how this is gonna work for us so we
started off with setting our eyelid so
I'm gonna take this middle shade right
here which is very similar to April in
the other palette in the pan it's
similar and just put it on my eye almost
like a translucent powder so maybe
that's what they were going for I don't
know
now for that grayish taupe I'm gonna
take this gray right here mix it in a
little bit with this brown to give it
more of the same type of look because as
you can tell they're super similar but
there's just something more warm about
Schuyler in the violet vos palette so
I'm gonna take a little bit of that
Brown just a very light sheer kind of
powder and I've I'm trying to build it
up and I feel like you can build it up
but you can still see right through it
you know it's just these days we go for
a big punch whenever we're using shadows
like this day and age is all about high
pigment so I totally get the whole
pigmentation thing so for the next shade
I'm gonna take it's this shade right
here okay so I'm gonna take me morphe
this morphe pencil brush right here and
dip into this black well let's just say
the black is very pigmented it's just it
won't move from this spot and almost
chalky the black is just spreading all
over my face and I could definitely tell
there's a bunch of fallout with this
black I'm gonna go back into this shade
right here you know it's just that this
the shadow is so loose like there's no
real pigmentation and it's very hard to
blend out you see it's just not as
pigmented like it's not sticking on the
skin the shadow is just kind of going
everywhere very hard to blend out so
honestly just feel like this became a
really crazy mess and the foundation
underneath it does not help the shadows
are not pigmented the foundation isn't
like Stables kind of smear
around my face so this side of my face
is a little frustrating to be honest but
I'm gonna go ahead and do my eyeliner
pop on some lashes and we are gonna move
on to the rest of the face one of the
high rated concealers is the YSL all
ours concealer this concealer had eight
thousand hearts a hundred and something
reviews I personally I use it and I like
it it has like a doe foot applicator
notice another thing that people really
loved about this concealer is that it
was very light weight but it's full
coverage it lasts all day it goes on
smooth and it's not drying to your under
eye which is a big thing
smooth lightweight effortless feeling
hydration and that is something that is
so important especially for the under
eyes because this is a very delicate
area of your face and you want to keep
this young as long as you can so the
fact that it's all of those things plus
it's full coverage that's just a huge
huge plus but my only thing with this
concealer is that I have to build it up
a little bit and there's other
concealers that I really don't have to
do much to work up the pigmentation and
full coverage but it is a very good
concealer that doesn't just wipe off
your face okay so for the worst or
lowest-rated sephora concealer it's
going to be this one this is from Laura
Mercier and this is the candle glow
concealer and highlighter looks like so
I have the shade number two and you have
to click it up from the bottom to push
the product up into this little spongy
thing right here so the major thing that
people complained about was that you had
to click it like a hundred times I've
clicked it a bunch of times too and it's
still not up oh I see it it's coming up
it's coming up
it is up we have some product on the
sponge I am so excited
alright so let's try and see if this is
going to hide my panda eyes this has a
three point two star rating on Sephora
and it is $32 right oh wow translucent
powder and primer is amazing I like a
lot of Laura Mercier's things so I'm
really curious to see what people are
talking about when it comes to concealer
so let's go ahead and try this under the
eye maybe I should have got shade one
this is shade two I just figured I'd be
shade to really like the applicator
another thing people said was that there
was micro glitters in the concealer I'm
actually gonna put it right here I'm
gonna need some help from this
foundation I put on earlier I would say
I can't really blend it in with this so
I'm gonna take my Beauty Blender I know
some people said that there was micro
glitters in there that were pretty
chunky but I don't see them at all
I wish the second shade wasn't as dark
it does kind of have like a drying
effect and let it sit for a second you
can definitely feel it's drying like it
tugs on your skin and I'm not really
liking this side of my face at all like
everything is so so bad about it like
there's no brightening effect I have to
move on okay so I'm gonna set my under
eyes one of the highest-rated transition
powders that was not Laura Mercier this
this actually had a higher rating than
Laura Mercier this is the Too Faced
peach perfect powder some mattifying
loose setting powder and people loved it
so I'm gonna bait on this side I
personally love the smell of everything
that Too Faced comes out with and that
you can eat it because this is kind of
getting in my mouth a little bit and I'm
not mad at it a lot of people said they
like the brightening effect that the
powder gives you that it goes on smooth
and it lasts all day a lot of people
like the scent the taste and all of
those things I definitely say yes that
is one of the reasons why I love this
but um so we're gonna let that set and
see how it sets in to the skin I already
know this is kind of a good one but we
are still gonna set the lowest-rated
powder in Sephora unfortunately was the
Sephora beauty amplifier setting powder
this was two stars on Sephora it is $16
and a lot of people just said it had a
funky smell to it and it was cakey and
it took off their makeup that was like
one of the hugest things that people
said just want to show you what it looks
like like so I'm just gonna get some in
there looks like that oh it does have a
really bad smell anyways we are going to
set this side of the face there's a big
mess going on hmm it doesn't really go
on the face very easy you see what I
mean we're gonna let that sit there and
let's see what happens yeah this thing
is so messy or bronzer the lowest and
high rated is the same brand the highest
rated bronzer was the NARS Laguna the
good old NARS Laguna you can never go
wrong with this guy this bronzer always
kind of made me feel like I shouldn't
use it because it has little gold flecks
throughout and I really don't like those
light reflecting things around my cheeks
because I have textured cheek areas I
never wanted to try it but once I
started using it I fell in love because
the shimmer completely just goes away
bronzer it was almost five stars is four
point seven has 3000 reviews most people
just like that there was no orange kind
of look to it it just looked like a
really pretty nice tan like a bronze tan
but not an orange tan so I think that's
why I really enjoy this bronzer as well
I just love the color of the bronzer and
you're just glides on the skin the
powder is just so smooth with glides on
the skin so nice and gives you just the
really pretty color you can really blend
this powder easily into your skin so
great things about the original NARS
Laguna they have the lowest rated
bronzer at 3.6 so it's not like crazy
bad but it's still a three and this is a
forty dollar bronzer this is thus NARS
Sun Wash diffusing bronze the difference
is that this one is matte also there's
like a different design on it but that's
pretty much it so I was really excited
when these came out because that's kind
of what I love matte bronzers for my
skin type so I was really excited about
it and I never really noticed a problem
but people say that there is no pigment
in this bronzer so we're gonna give it a
try is there pigment oh oh there is some
pigment so what will mines is good I
don't know what you guys are saying but
it's pigment
okay I'm gonna wipe away the baking
powder and see what where you are left
with one of the top-rated Sephora
lippies is the NARS power matte lip
pigment I think it's called this is
American woman so we are gonna put this
on this side of the face the good side I
actually really like the scent and I
really like that it has a pointed
applicator so nice someone to go ahead
and put that on my lip on this side yeah
I really like this applicator it's just
so easy and so precise a lot of people
said that they love the pigmentation
they also said that it was super
lightweight smooth and just not drying
at all which is very interesting for a
liquid lip one of the lowest rated
Sephora not the worst but the lowest
rated lippies is the sephora cream lip
stain right here and I have the shade
number 13 it was just a regular doe foot
applicator I'm gonna pop that on to this
side and hopefully it's the same color
very close honestly I I don't mind this
phone this lip that's really weird it's
not like heavy it's not drying so far
I'm gonna wait till it dries down but
the pigmentation is really nice
while this dries down a lot of people
said this is super drying it was patchy
I mean in the tube I can see it's kind
of breaking apart a little bit but on
the lip it applies really nice it is
pigmented and I don't feel like it's
drying I must have got a really good
batch because I don't think it's bad at
all so I'm gonna say I don't agree with
the reviews on this lip stain thank you
