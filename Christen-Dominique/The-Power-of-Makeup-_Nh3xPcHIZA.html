makeup video I was inspired by
nikkietutorials she basically did one
side of her face bully glam and the
other side of his bare face so I got a
comment on my Instagram that I was ugly
on snapchat so they unfollowed me also
if I show my videos or my husband shows
my videos to other people and I have no
makeup on right away there they're like
wow you look so great on camera or you
look so different um I'm happy with
myself barefaced and fully glam I look
back on myself and realized how insecure
I was about my looks
especially my face I wouldn't go outside
of the house without makeup on full glam
makeup and it was so bad that I wouldn't
even go to Scrushy store without makeup
I remember looking back and my mom
having to wait for me until I was fully
done so it was stressful for her
especially if she had to get out of the
house quick and is stressful for me
because I felt like I had to do this in
order to feel pretty over time I
realized this was very unhealthy so I
was trying to seek ways for myself to
feel better and I was on YouTube
stumbled across the make makeup
tutorials and notice that these girls
were putting their bare face out there
and not really caring what other people
thought and I thought that was really
courageous so I decided to make a video
of myself putting on makeup and put it
out there into the world not really
thinking anybody would watch but still
putting myself in an uncomfortable
position to accept myself over time you
guys started watching and I started to
gain confidence in my own looks and not
care what other people thought because
you guys would tell me I was beautiful
without makeup and that really helped
build my confidence and now I do makeup
tutorials to express myself and to show
people techniques in different looks and
I use it as a tool rather than a mask so
today I'm going to be doing one side of
my face fully glam and the other side is
going to stay bare faced and I'm going
to embrace it and I hope you guys do the
same embrace both bare faced and full
and it's okay because makeup is fun so
with that said in Boba making noise with
her little play ball let's go ahead and
get started to use this japonesque face
primer and it's silicone base so it's
going to fill in all your fine lines and
big pores I'm gonna put it on this side
only so for foundation I'm going to use
my L C micro silk foundation this is
going to even out my skin tone conceal a
lot of my blemishes next I'm going to
brighten up my under eye circles so I'm
going to use my Urban Decay Naked skin
this is one of my favorite concealers
because it is so heavy duty so I'm going
to just put a little bit there go up to
the cheekbone so that it highlights
there too
bringing it up to the cheekbone makes it
makes your eyes look more lifted I want
to flow even brow I obviously do not
have that going on so I'm going to
elongate it and make it a little bit
thicker and use my honest Donnie honest
Asya pomade in ash brown to do that
so that's my brow and now I'm going to
do my eyeshadow I'm going to use the Too
Faced Stardust by Vegas nay palette it
has a lot of the colors I'd use on an
everyday basis so I'm going to take
millennial right here I like to have
defined deep set eyes so I'm going to
first start off with a lighter color and
then gradually work my way into a darker
color
I'm going to go in with girls night and
I'm going to focus this on the outer
crease
now I'm going to go into even deeper
color which is this deep plum II purple
color right here and it's called a
double tap and I'm going to take a 2:39
shader brush to do that
next I'm going to highlight my brow bone
so that my eyes look more lifted so I'm
going to take chandelier this very matte
bone color right here and this is a TMT
154 brush now I'm going to move on to
the lid for the lid I'm using selfie
now I'm gonna add some light to my inner
corners so I'm going to take this
pigment from Too Faced this is nude beam
I am going to go ahead and pop this into
my inner corners now for my favorite
part I'm going to do winged liner I'm
using the Kat Von D tattoo liner
rupert's is a limited edition one so it
just looks like really cool packaging
now I'm just going to put a little bit
of the Too Faced better than sex mascara
on just so that it can help with my
false lashes now I'm just gonna pop on
my violet boss lashes user and
boundaries and I almost forgot to smoke
out the bottom lashline if wouldn't be a
glamorous complete look without it so I
just took the three crease colors I used
at the top and I just applied them to
the lower lash line as well for added
definition I'm going to add the Tarte
slash liner to my waterline now I'm
going to define my features and kind of
slim down my face a little bit so I'm
using the Kat Von D shade light palette
and I take this color right here and I'm
going to focus it right underneath the
cheekbone I'm going to take it around
the temple up to the hairline on the
forehead I'm going to also go down my
nose just to straighten it out a little
bit I'm going to go in with this
highlight color right here and I'm going
to take it underneath my under eyes
going all the way up to the tops of my
cheekbones this is going to make my face
look a lot more lifted and youthful if I
take a little bit of face powder just to
lock in the foundation and up just a
little bit more coverage now it's time
for the blush I'm going to take this
blush from Tarte this is captivating and
just take a little bit of blush right in
the center of the highlight and the
contour I'm gonna bring my cheekbones up
a little bit more and really highlight
them so I'm going to take the Becca
highlighter in Champagne pop this is the
one by Jacqueline Phil
so I want my lips to be a little more
even in full so I'm going to take some
lip liner for that this is max spice my
current favorite lip liner right here so
I'm going to go over my natural lip line
and then I'm going to go in with MIDI
from the ultra matte lip collection with
color pop and then for a highlight I'm
using Mac Smith's lipstick and just
placing it right on the center this is
going to help them look a little bit
more plump and this is the final look my
final glam look on this side and my
natural face on this side I hope you
guys embrace both natural and glam and
let's get I love you guys so much and
hope you enjoyed
