today I am going to show you how to get
this look also I'm going to show you my
adventures that I went on with Tarte in
Hawaii I did a lot of bucket list type
of things
I can definitely scratch them off now
you guys are gonna get to see that and
how i got this makeup look with all
their new stuff some other new stuff
from other places and I don't know it's
going to be a lot of fun also I want to
tell you guys about this campaign that's
going on with tart and the bystander
Revolution it's basically spreading
positivity throughout the internet their
hashtag is kiss and makeup on the trip
we got these really cute shirts right
here and it says kiss and make up it's
just spreading positivity throughout the
internet so on anyone's next feed or new
picture that comes up on your Instagram
I encourage you to write something nice
to that person because being on the
Internet you get a lot of different
comments some of them are negative some
of them are positive but the negative
ones do kind of hurt and tend to stand
out more than the positive for some
reason I don't know why is that happened
just encourage you to go out and leave
nice comments anyways I hope you guys
enjoyed this look and my travel vlog I'm
going to start off by hydrating my skin
using this new hydrating boost from
Tarte and it's called a drink of h2o it
looks like a gel it's this and it's
super moisturizing so I'm going to put a
layer of that on first before I start my
makeup and this actually some of these
products don't come out until a little
bit later I don't have the exact dates
right now but I'll have them listed
below for you I did my eyebrows before I
got here but I feel like I missed some
spots that I didn't realize so I'm going
to use this new little thingy I got from
tweezerman
it's called precision folding razor and
it's for your brows and stuff like that
like or it says bikini touch-ups I'm
just going to use it for my brows I like
how it gives you a smooth finish and the
facial hair remover also minimizes
regrowth because what it does is it
grabs the entire hair including the
follicle so it removes the hair at the
root I didn't know that until I looked
it up so crazy
semmen 'take medium
honey this is super full coverage that
looks like this it's like a.j and this
is the brush it looks so cool this side
is to scoop it up and then of course
this one is to blend it buff it into
your skin so I'm just going to take a
little bit with the spatula a little bit
I definitely wouldn't advise you to just
dunk your brush in there because that's
going to look really cakey so I always
put it on my hand my hands always the
messiest part once I finish my makeup I
have all kinds of liquids and shadows
all over my hands now my face can
actually match the rest of your body
and then for concealer I'm going to use
this rainforest of the sea concealer I
love this Andrej Golda purple look it's
so cute and I'm just going to put it on
my hand I never put it on my face I'd
straight from the bottle because just
gonna get a little too much then I'm
gonna just get my finger and top it into
my skin it's covering everything and
kind of brightening everything and it
feels very lightweight on my skin had to
do my brows in for my brows I'm using my
dip brow from Anastasio - Brown and this
little guy right here when I do my brows
I like to focus on the areas where I
don't have much hair so that's like the
very top of my brow is very short so I
like to add some there and then
everything towards the back of the arch
I'm going to pick up this makeup geek
shadow in Morocco I'm gonna blend it all
over the crease and the lid and then for
the edges I just want it to be very soft
so make sure you blend out the edges
really nicely and then I'm going to go
ahead and use the new Tarte rainforest
by 2 C palette and I'm using that color
right there I'm going to focus it on the
inner and outer part of my eyelid
I'm going to go in with this greyish
purple shade right here and I'm going to
focus it right on the center of the lid
and this is going to really make your
eyes pop I feel like this color would
universally make everybody's eyes pop
I'm going to do the same thing I did
with this eye to the other eye and then
I'm going to pick up Morocco again I'm
going to work that onto the lower part
of the lashline and with the shade that
we used on the outer and inner part of
the lid we're going to put that on to
the lower part of the lid as well but
you still want Morocco to peek through
and if it kind of faded away just go
ahead and blend it back in there I'm
doing that towards the top of my shadows
as well so I'm going to take the
lightest color in the palette apply it
to my brow bone and then work it down
into the other colors so everything
transitions nicely and it looks very
smooth and then with this liner I'm
going to make a very subtle wing it's
going to be very short and small nothing
too drastic and then I'm going to go
ahead and start baking my face I'm using
the Laura Mercier powder translucent
powder and I'm going to work this onto
my under eyes and right underneath my
cheekbone I know you can't tell but I
have this on there for a few minutes and
then I just wiped it away I feel like my
under eyes don't crease as bad and my
contour pops out a little bit more when
I bake a little bit and then for the
blush I'm using makeup geek summer fling
on the cheekbones I'm so excited for the
highlight because I'm using the newest
Tarte highlighting palette and i
swatched it for you guys right here and
they're so pigmented this is only
literally one swipe and I'm going to pop
it onto the tops of my cheekbones the
tip of my nose and on the Cupid's bow
and then with a different brush I'm
going to blend out the edges of the
highlight so everything looks nice and
smooth
and I just got these two new lippies in
from Oprah the lip liner is in chestnut
and then I got a liquid lipstick in
Staten Island they're both very grey
shades and um I don't normally wear that
but I wanted to try it out for you guys
in this video I actually like the way it
looks it's so different and new and then
for my lashes I'm taking the tweezerman
almond shaped lash curler for almond
eyes and just curling my lashes and this
is the final we're about to walk into
our hotel nice you oh my god I got some
new Sony's cute heart goodies just nice
jewelry oh my god it's crazy they're

god I just realized that this is awesome
