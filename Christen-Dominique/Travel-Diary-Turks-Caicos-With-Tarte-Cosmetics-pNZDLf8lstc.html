I don't know what you want let's have a
bit of fun the moment you wake up and
realize you're in Turks and Caicos tart
oh my god it's like one of the best
feelings I obviously had a lot of fun
last night because I'm waking up
expanded food I'm about to start getting
ready for the day so I'm Sheena brush my
teeth on my hair how it looks there I
mean it stay like that the whole trip
messy Beach hair is the best hair and
then I haven't leftover I makeup on my
ice cream the night before so I just
wipe them off for these wipes and so
really good and then just wash my face a
little bit I mean won't wash my face I
always have a habit of saying a little
bit so I'm going to start getting ready
I'm just going to go ahead and spit when
faced with this primer i rated my under
eyes because they definitely need it but
I also use this other polymer to
brightener and I use that before I use
the Beauty primer cream it's like a
foundation and it's super full coverage
if you want it to be if you keep
layering it up it basically looks like
this after a while so I used this primer
foundation the whole time I didn't use
anything else on my face while I was in
Turks and Caicos and then I also applied
a little bit of concealer under my eyes
filled in my brows just a bit and then I
went straight into my eye shadow I'm
taking the tartlet in boom palette which
is not out yet but don't worry I'm doing
five of them away very soon and I'm just
putting on just a crease color blending
it out really well and then putting on
this shimmery golden color which is
beautiful I tell people you guys to try
it and then I'm going to do just a small
wing and a little bit of mascara
so now I'm just going to contour my face
a little bit I'm going to use the
contour stick from Tarte it is super
blendable and really easy to use so I
did basically this look the entire time
this is Park Avenue princess lipstick
and a little bit of bronzer on my cheeks
and that is the completed makeup look
and literally have this for the entire
time you were there so before I head out
I wanted to show you guys my room they
had champagne and fruit for us this was
the view to the balcony and this area
right here was full of makeup by the end
of the day so after I was done getting
ready we all headed down to the lobby so
that we can meet up and head to tarts
house but first can we just appreciate
how beautiful this site is I mean the
hotel was amazing
they had a pool in the middle of the
hotel and also we're just gonna sit here
and I appreciate tabes little dance
she's doing for us the quick tour at the
tart house right now and as soon as you
walk in the handier tart cream which is
absolutely awesome
oMG and we're walking through with the
Chart House and there's makeup
everywhere with all the new stuff it's
absolutely amazing you walk out and
there's this huge pool it's like a
never-ending pool and then it's the
ocean it's I can get over it it's so
beautiful
this right here is a mermaid fin and
when I saw this me my friend were like
no we have got to put these things on we
need a picture we need video everything
with these mermaid fins so we got into
the pool and started flapping our fins
for the camera so after we were done
being mermaids we went ahead and got
food my favorite part was the was it
grilled avocados oh my god they were
amazing you know my favorite dish or my
favorite food or thing what is it
vegetable fruit is an avocado and then
when you think it can't get any better
than this they bring in the puppies so
I'm on my way to dinner right now and
it's gonna be on the beach because we're
really cute I'm really excited to do
I don't know what you want let's have a
bit of fun
fifteen years ago I started
now a lot of exploiters now and I wasn't
then and
that would never have imagined like
being here with all of you guys like
superstars fixing glucose okay guys for
coming it's so slow they were here
searching for a little frog I've never
seen a frog this small before this is my
first time out of the country and I have
to say I couldn't have been with the
most amazing people honestly thank God
every single day for everything that I
have in my life and everyone I am truly
blessed and I love you guys thank you so
much tart for everything that you did I
am forever grateful and this definitely
is going down as one of the most best
trips I've ever had
