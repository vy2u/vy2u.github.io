on heads
hey guys happy Halloween this is my
first Halloween video of the year I'm so
excited
so pumped for this video do we
appreciate the intro for a second can we
fix these are a round of applause please
thumbs up first Cesar in this video it's
a fake tattoo something anybody can wear
you still feel pretty but then again you
can still feel very Halloweeny
on the other side choose your fate
you're gonna live are you gonna die if
you want to see how I got these looks
right here then don't forget to
subscribe to my channel and hit that
notification bells to give you a part of
the quad family and without further ado
and let's get on how about if it's
today's grammar all over my face just so
we can have an even base to work with
and anything that goes on top of it it's
gonna sit down even it's gonna look
smooth and it's going to last all night
I'm just gonna do my face how would I
would normally do my face because it's
human so I'm gonna take the estee lauder
double wear for that and 3w 120 take it
all the way down the neck basically make
an imaginary line going down in the
middle of your face I'm gonna jump
straight into the eyes so for that I'm
gonna use the tartlet toasted palate
which smells so good
it honestly smells like I just want to
curl up next to a fireplace and drink
hot cocoa make s'mores and Matt bone
color and I'll place that right on top
of the lid work it all the way through
this is gonna be our base I'm not gonna
go into too much detail about how to do
this side of my face because you guys
have seen it a hundred times and I
really want the focus to be the death
part of my face and I'm gonna go in with
a warm shade the lightest one they have
so this is cashmere and just start to
warm up the crease now I'm gonna take
warm this shade right here and I'm gonna
work that into the outer part of the
crease as well okay that was way too
much then I'm gonna go in with cozy
right here and just work that on the
part of the crease I'm gonna take candle
with this small little precise brush I'm
gonna pop that right into the inner
corners for some highlight now I'm just
gonna take my TARDIS double take
eyeliner and I'm gonna wing out my liner
I'm just gonna add some mascara and some
lashes
I think these I think this is an iconic
lash and it's funny because I only have
one iconic lash I always take these
little Lily lashes with me to travel and
I literally don't even have anything to
match that well at least I could put it
to use
today on my human eye so I popped on my
iconic lash right there and I'm gonna
actually started filling out the crease
with this dark shade right here fire
side so I'm just gonna fill it in just a
little bit more to give that in there
I'm gonna take the Urban Decay Naked
skin and just work that underneath my
dark circle I got this from my friend
Melissa when I was in Paris with L'Oreal
really beautiful person and beautiful
girl she is an instagramer on YouTube or
so so sweet she gave me this
terracotta spray from Guerlain I think
that's how you see the name and it's a
spray it works so beautifully it
literally looks like airbrushed bronze
I'm gonna put a little bit on a napkin
work my Beauty Blender in there just to
add some warmth to my face I'm gonna
take these coverfx drops the custom
enhancer drops in celestial but I'm
gonna go ahead and spritz this maxixe
plus
for the highlight almost forgot I wanted
to use a powder highlight on top let me
use proud proud friend very proud friend
right now this is the elf X heart
defense er collab highlight this is the
coffee and cream hub this is the coffee
and cream highlight duo it is so perfect
I can't even begin to tell you this is
rose bold right here it's so beautiful
on the skin and I like to use this one
right here for the top so I'm gonna take
this one first and I'm gonna pop it on
right on the top and then I'm gonna take
this rose gold shade and I'm gonna work
it down into the rest of the cheek and
it's just so beautiful
blinding so proud of you I love this
highlight this is perfect just like you
I love it so much you love her I love it
I love coffee I love cream this is this
is everything the packaging is beautiful
it's rose gold it's cute it has a heart
it's okay so now for the fun part I'm
gonna do this side of my face which is
death I don't want it to be like pasty
white I want it to be as realistic as
possible so I like to take just the
whitest foundation I have I have the
number seven stay perfect foundation in
the shade I have no clue it doesn't not
even say sticker must have fell off but
it's a pretty pale shade I'm just going
to take that put it on my face with a
Beauty Blender I'm just gonna start to
work the deaths
skin color onto my face I'm so excited
for this part this is my first Halloween
tutorial so I'm so excited about it I'm
like super giddy so I'm gonna let that
dry for a second and then I go in with a
second layer of foundation to really
lock in this pale look
we're gonna go ahead and lock it in
place I'm going to use the dermablend
loose setting powder and I'm just gonna
put that all over of the face so I'm
gonna start to hollow out my cheekbones
and just start to contour on the face
so for that I'm going to use this a
makeup forever I shadow here there's no
name it's like a number which I don't
know if you guys would care about that
it's M 536 when use a few different
shades but this is the one I'm going to
start off with so to contour I'm gonna
take this Sigma tapered highlighter
brush and it's in number f-35 I'm gonna
go a little bit higher than my natural
Hollow
okay I'm gonna go into the neck start to
shade that I have this is actually from
anastacio it's one of the contour kit
colors and is fawn start to shade out a
little bit further the next color I'm
going to go into is from makeup geek if
this is a bad Rock it's a matte gray
shade and I'm gonna go right underneath
it and anywhere you just feel a hollow
or a bone that's kind of prominent you
go right underneath it and now I'm gonna
use a little bit of black I'm gonna
intensify the contour a little bit more
later but I'm gonna start to work on the
eyes and I'm gonna first start off with
this red shade it's like a dark red this
one right here and I'm gonna work it
right in the hollow of my eye and I'm
gonna take it all the way up to the brow
bone and then I'm going to work it
downwards really close to the eyelid
bring in concrete jungle into the eye
alright extend this all the way out here
on the lid I'm gonna take the LA girl
Pro primer it's black so I think that's
gonna work perfect for this look so I'm
just gonna take the block and work
all into I'm gonna take some of this
orange shade from makeup forever and
this one from makeup geek it's called
peppy I'm gonna mix them together and
start to work that into the crease then
with this black shadow I'm gonna go over
the lid completely I'm gonna take some
of this red on this fan brush just took
my lash fan brush I'm gonna work that
right underneath my my lash line add
today red I'm gonna actually use a lip
liner since I'm going a little crazy
with brows I'm gonna kind of make my
brow hairs into the veins so I'm gonna
take some of this red and mix a little
bit of brown together and I'm gonna go
in between of the brow veins I'm gonna
add a little bit of the blue to little
parts of the veins
so I'm taking these two eyelashes this
one is from Amelia castano ex glamour by
Josue cake B Miami lash glue them
together I'm gonna wide out my lips so
I'm gonna take this white shade here
from the tsuba Beauty palette and really
white out this area and kind of also add
some paleness back in here and I feel
like I lost them in some areas just
because I was blending the purples and
the blues and then right on at the inner
part of the lip I'm gonna make this
black I start to do these little veins
