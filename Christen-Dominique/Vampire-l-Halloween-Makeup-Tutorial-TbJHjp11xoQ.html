those Disney characters kids are sitting
on a bench somewhere you know drinking a
soda no rush lemon tree kid quick come
on I just stole this loaf of bread from
the marketplace because I'm poor and
guess what you're poor buzzes let's sing
let's sing a song while we run
these are you coming to bed
ah
hey guys welcome back to my channel if
you enjoyed that creepy intro at the
beginning I advise you to watch it in
the dark if you like creepy stuff like
this let me know if you can make it
through it comment below because I had a
tough time and it's already like about
to be dark outside I am going to
brighten up my skin a whole bunch I
don't want to look like a complete ghost
I do want to have like a little bit of a
human side to me so I'm using the
lightest foundation that I have I want
to make sure that it's full coverage I'm
using the Kat Von D locket tattoo
foundation after I have layered that on
as you can see I did two layers of this
stuff so we can get it nice and bright
and the coverage is bomb calm um so
basically I am blending it in right here
around my eyes making sure there's no
creases and then I'm taking my Ben Nye
super white powder and I'm just gonna
brush that blend that into my skin just
to set the foundation in place now it's
time for the brows I started using a
pencil and then I realized that that was
not working for me so I used a black
powder instead just try to make your
eyebrows as thin and evil as possible so
now I'm going to hollow out my under-eye
circles and some taking these two shades
right here and I'm going to go right
underneath my under eyes taking it into
the inner parts of the inner corners and
also on the tops of the cheekbones and
then I'm going to take this purple and
pinkish purple shade I'm gonna blend it
right on top this is gonna make it look
a little bit bruised and just
bloodthirsty in the eyes so I'm gonna
take it right underneath the eyes also
taking a reddish brown to hollow out the
nose a little bit here I'm just blending
the edges making sure they're nice and
soft next I'm using these Scone
cosmetics pretty eyes eyeliner in plum
and this is a pretty intensive color
it's a really nice purple I also added a
little bit of black to redefine the eyes
and add a little bit more drama to the
look
so I'm going to take this red shade
right here I'm going to blend it right
underneath the purple and I still want
the brown to show underneath the red so
make sure that is still peeking through
and then I'm blending it in all the way
into the inner part of the nose and then
taking a big fluffy powder brush just to
soften everything after that I'm taking
this gray shade and blending that into
the crease and now for the lids I'm
going to use a stark white shadow and
we'll place that right on the lids make
sure it's nice and packed on there and
then after the white has been blended up
into the crease a little bit I'm going
to take a fluffy brush just to make sure
all the edges are nice and soft so now
I'm going to create an intense cat eye
to do that I'm using my girl optic
eyeliner and if you have some trouble
applying your liner and getting a nice
clean line take your time and you will
get it right trust me I still have
trouble I do not think I am the best at
it so practice makes perfect and now I'm
just going to apply a little bit of
mascara on the top really just for the
lashes to get tacky with it and mostly
on the bottom to apply my lashes I'm
using these imita tweezers these are the
slant tweezers I have the perfect
tension just to slide your brow hair out
there awesome now I'm going to do my
veins using the blue Browns and purples
just mixing all of these shapes together
and I am creating these little branches
underneath my eyes and I'm kind of
branching them off of each other making
little V's just placing them in random
places underneath and then I'm going in
with a fluffy brush just to smooth them
out
so next I'm adding the Ben Nye thick
blood to my veins and then I honestly
got a little too happy with drawing
squiggly lines on my face so I added
them on my forehead for no reason just
to do it but you can customize this look
how you want you can add more add less
whatever you like and then I went in
with black and a little bit of dark
brown to call out the cheekbones around
the forehead and temples and now I'm
going to do the lips the lips are just
going to be black I used a Kat Von D
black lipstick for this and a little bit
of a NYX lip liner to sharpen up
everything and then I went back in with
a black matte powder and I use that on
the center of the lips next I added
these small vampire teeth right here and
this is the completed luck thumbs up and
comment below what Halloween looks you
want to see next thank you guys for
watching I love you all so much into the
next video bye dollies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
