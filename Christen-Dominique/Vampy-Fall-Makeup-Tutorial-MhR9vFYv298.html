so ecstatic about this book right now
I've been wanting vampy eyes with a
vampy plum lip I have had this look at
my head and I love it so much this is
like an ultimate ball look for me

you have brown eyes blue eyes green eyes
they are going to stand out and look
very beautiful also going to be on style
code live tonight if you guys want to
check it out style code live is a show
on amazon.com where they showcase all
things beauty and fashion I am going to
be doing a little segment there today on
concealer hacks I'm going to show you
how to make your winged super sharp your
brows on extra flaky you want to check
that out it's on tonight at 9 p.m.
eastern time at 6 p.m. Pacific time and
the visit if you want to learn how to
get this look then keep watching every
step is the best step because it's going
to help your foundation stay on all day
long how many is a primer first so that
my makeup sits on my face really nice
and it goes on even and use this it
cosmetics bye bye pores primer it makes
you feel like you have satin sheets on
your face and then over that I'm going
to use the Porefessional like a heavy
duty pore primer and it also takes away
some of the shine and it mattifies the
areas that are shiny the foundation I'm
going to be using the Urban Decay all
nighter waterproof long-wear foundation
in the shade 6.0 I love the foundation
bottle it's so cute every time I open my
foundation door I just see it I'm like
oh it's so key F just gonna work that
into my skin and this is one of those
intensely full coverage foundation
okay so now I'm going to go ahead and do
some concealer I'm going to take the
banana foundation stick I'm just going
to see how this works I'm interested to
see what the covered is going to be like
do this little checkmark looking thing
underneath my eye so you get that lifted
effect gonna blend that out with my
finger I'm giving my beauty blenders a
little bit of a rest and I'm gonna
actually highlight with this too so I'm
gonna go right here from the mouth and
make a big o
upside down triangle there or what I
like to call a triangle I feel like I'm
giving myself a massage cuz I am going
really in with my fingers right now I'm
just beating the face I'm going to go
ahead and pop on this porcelain found
eight this porcelain concealer aqua
luminous perfecting this is the longest
name I've ever seen becca aqua luminous
perfecting concealer this is in the
shade porcelain it's going to make a
little check mark right here I mean a
little upside down triangle right here
this almost feels like a light under eye
cream and I like how it's kind of
luminous I'm gonna pop on some brows I'm
going to use the Bravo conditioning
primer from benefit so what you do is
click this little tube up mix that noise
and then some of that primer comes out
it has these little ridges on it so it
kind of cleans up your hairs makes your
hairs more defined as you brush them so
you can already see you're creating that
feathery brow look and I'm going to do
the same thing on this side now I am
going to fill them in to fill in my
brows and create this feathery hair like
strokes I'm using the precisely my brow
pencil and shade for from benefit and
flipping it on its side so that it makes
these tiny hairlike strokes and I'm just
going in the direction that my hair is
naturally growing I don't know if you
guys know this but I am in Sephora on
the benefit gondola for the new brow
products I am so excited to be
partnering with a benefit for this video
oh and creating these feathery brows and
this is the look that I actually have on
the gondola so I am a very ecstatic
about this video today you don't even
have to have the primer on there if you
want an instant feathery brow if you
take the Bravo and just comb over
lightly it gives you the prettiest
feathery brow it's so it's like instant
I love it I love it enough so now we are
going to move on to the eyes I'm going
to use the benefit stay don't stray a
little bit on my eye moves
I'm going to use this you weigh
essential matte and shimmer palette I
love this palette and the packaging I am
in love with you a is just so chic and
really good quality it's actually their
first eyeshadow palette and I am in love
with it it's just the perfect amount of
shimmers versus mattes
I love the reddish brown like a peachy
Brown so the first color I'm going to go
in with is this peak this peachy pink
one right here and I'm just going to
take a flat eyeshadow brush a derp brush
a Mac 239 brush and I'm going to load it
up with that peachy pinky shade and I'm
going to start to apply that at the base
and then work it up before we put on any
more eye shadow I'm going to use some of
this scotch tape too as a guideline for
my shadow I want it to be kind of sharp
towards the edge so I'm just going to
start to work that into the inner part
of my lid and you get outwards and
upwards
next shade I'm going to pick up desert
this map Keit shade right here and I'm
using a morphe 22 brush to work that
into the crease and I want to put this a
little bit higher tad bit above my
crease just because the way my eye is
shaped on what I want the transition
shade to really show okay so now I'm
going to go back into my morphe 35o M
palettes I'm going to take this one
right here this shade just looks like a
pumpkin I'm going to work that over the
crease I like to layer my crease shades
because it just makes it so much easier
to blend it makes it look like the
transition is super smooth and now i'm
taking my morphe m41 two brush and i'm
going to work that into the outer part
of my crease let's try that over again
so that brush obviously didn't work out
for us so I'm going to go ahead and take
my Sigma X exact lend a thirty-two brush
and I'm gonna work that shade that dark
shade all over the lid I'm going to
start to blend it upwards so I'm using
the Sigma e30 8 brush to blend it I'm
just going to use circular motions and
working it upwards towards the brow bone
so this brush is called the diffused
crease brush so if you guys are always
kind of like confused about what brushes
does what it says it right here I think
that's awesome it's the e38 in case you
guys are wondering I'm going to work it
up into the brow until it gives me this
very sheer wash of color it literally
feels like little feathers so like you
want to use the lightest touch and so
that means you're not pressing down hard
at all this part doesn't matter cuz the
tapes going to come off and then all the
fallout on the bottom we're just going
to clean it up at the end back to I got
the keys from DJ Khaled and it'd be cool
if you guys were right here with me and
we had a Big O dance party
it looks pretty crazy and messy right
now but it's okay because when we take
off that tape it is gonna look so good
in so sharp so now I'm going to go ahead
and move on to my eyeliner I'm going to
go in with my black track eyeliner from
Mac and my Sigma zero six winged liner
brush I'm going to create my own wing
I like using a black gel liner and then
going back over it with a liquid liner
afterwards if you just have more control
of the shape near the inner corners it
just makes the perfect eyeliner and now
that we're done with that it looks
really crazy let's go ahead and take off
the tape it kind of sort of really takes
off your foundation but it's not that
big of a deal we just take a little bit
of makeup light well I put away prints
are so easy so if I have any mess-ups on
my eyeliner or my brows I like to take a
pen sealer and a concealer brush and
just clean it up a little bit like if
it's around my brows then I'll just go
underneath them and clean it up it just
enhances the brow shape so much now I'm
going to go into the lower part of the
lash line for that I'm going to take
this reddish brown shade right here to
work it into the or part of the lash
line and then I'm also going into the
shade right next to it and just blending
out the harsh line at the bottom and
just kind of blending and transitioning
the colors I just picked up this brush
that we used earlier to apply that brown
shade right here and I'm just going over
it a little bit towards the outer part
just to add a little more of a
definition so I can see that we have on
already on our under eyes we're just
going to take a clean brush i'm using
this morphe five-to-one brush and i'm
just going right underneath it just to
clean it up a little bit so you clean it
up right here
concealer is our best friend when it
comes to makeup I'm not going to do
black eyeliner but I'm going to go in
with the same brush and just that a
touch of that black I'm just going to
touch the black barely and then pop it
on to like
where our lashes hit our skin just going
to put on a little bit of mascara and
then a pop on some false lashes and I
will be right now okay so now I'm going
to set my face with translucent powder
I'm going to take my Real Techniques eat
a sponge and just work this on right
underneath our contour and anywhere you
put this it's just going to brighten up
that area a little bit more and it's
also not going to move for like eight
hours because it's going to bake your
face it's also going to set the makeup
you put the right amount of powder they
will not crease and I'm going to dust
off my baking powder and I'm using one
of the Nicole Concilio brushes from
Tarte to do that and sweeping it away
you're just knocking off that excess
powder and now that I kind of have a
little bit in my brush I'm just going to
work it all over my face because I don't
want to add any more coverage or I don't
want to add any more color to my face
I'm just going to work it around my
entire face go ahead and put on a little
bit of this bronzer this is from the Mak
Selena collection in techno Colombia
it's a matte powder blush palette and
I'm these this to bronze up my face a
little bit she was my idol growing up as
a child I wanted to be just like her and
then I'm gonna go in with this shade
right here so I'm gonna take this
contoured brush from Marc Jacobs they
actually call it the blush so I'm gonna
take it and use that shade right there
pop it onto my cheekbones
I actually got sent a pack at the entire
package from a Selena collection and I
was missing the red shade of lipstick
and when I was to go by it was sold out
so I am who I'm really wanting to
recreate that Selena look
gotten some requests from you guys
there's been two amazing videos out
there I'm gonna go ahead and pack on
this blush for the highlight I mean is
the cover effects sunlight you can see
my entire setup right here you see that
that's all my setup it's so weird
I'm gonna go ahead and use the cover of
X I lighter and then shades sunlight and
I'm going to posh it I'm going to use my
finger to put it on my nose a little bit
you're working a little Matt guys I
haven't gotten my nails done in a while
and I just did them for this video like
really quick and if I don't do my nail a
really bad habit of biting like this
skin around I have to get them done but
I at least kind of them a nice plummy
color that I thought would suit this
video and for my for the tops of my
cheeks I'm going to use this brush right
here this is the morphe M 509 brush I'm
going to use that to apply the highlight
to it to the tops of my cheekbones this
is so so pretty I would kind of want to
put it somewhere in my makeup look but I
want to leave my my eyes kind of matte
after I did the review on the Chi liquid
lipsticks I was so in love with this
colors like a lot of her site for the
fall I don't think I have to do a video
using a love bite I need to sharpen this
so bad but I cannot find my sharpener
I'm going to use the color pop dukes
lip pencil lippie pencil and I'm going
to outline my lips with it
so this is the exciting part perfect
