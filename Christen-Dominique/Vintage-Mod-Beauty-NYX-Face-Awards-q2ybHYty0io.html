imperfect though where everyone follows
the rules and everything is black and
white there's no in-between well your
parents won't let me do anything but
they're not around and I'm really
curious as to what's behind that good if
you tell me not to go too I wonder why
hmm the coast is clear let's go see Oh
what is this that's a beautiful dress
and it's in color
Wow it's beautiful parents would never
let me wear anything like this
is this a dream what is that okay we can
catch up to the story later but for now
I'm going to show you how to get this
mod makeup first I'm going to pick up
from that mineral finishing powder to my
skin to add a healthy even complexion
and it's the 60s so make sure you look
extra mattified I'm going to swirl that
around evenly all over my face and if
you have any foundation it'll just lock
it in even better then I'm going to fill
in my brows with NYX eyebrow cake powder
in a color that's two to three shades
lighter than my hair color for a natural
lip now an upward motion we're going to
comb out the excess powder and make our
brows look extra polished now it's time
to prime our eyes I'm using the HD
eyeshadow base so that our eyeshadow
looks vibrant and won't crease and to
smooth out our HD primer I'm going to
take this Phoenix primer brush and
evenly cover the lids girls in the 60s
mod girls that is love our eyelids to be
a lovely pale and neck so I'm packing on
Nyx's nude matte shadow in kiss the day
with my big fat shadow brush
every girl should have a clean blending
brush on hand so that's why I have my
b13 I shadow brush from NYX remember
girls keep a clean one by your side this
is the key to perfect looking makeup if
you want a slightly sultry look add some
depth to your eyes by washing on a taupe
color into your crease using a small
pencil shape brush for extra precision
I'm using the color maybe later
you must not skip a step it's not an
option to get the full mod of X taking
on liner to your lower waterline for a
larger wide eyed effect darling isn't it
if you feel like this is a bit scary
don't worry I'll show you a trick later
on next for an easy perfect 60s cat I am
using Nyx's the curve liner it fits
perfectly in your hand and gives you the
perfect cat eye watch and see
for deep-set MOG looking eyes grabbed
either a brown or black eyeliner
whichever you prefer and line your
crease to your liking doesn't just make
your eyes look exciting okay so here's
the trick I was telling you that I'd
show you later on grab a black eye
pencil I'm using the NYX Kajal pencil
and line the lower lash line
this will redefine your eyes but you're
a mod girl
so extend the line straight out for a
groovy far out boxy eye now a mod Perl
is only as foxy and cool as her makeup
so I'm going to add the intensity but
using this black gel liner to go over
the line this is going to make sure our
line is smooth and intense time to perk
up those lashes back in prehistoric
times you have to have natural curly
lashes now you can curl them at will you
actually add eyelash curlers in the 60s
the next part is a very important part
of our mod look take some lashes and
apply them as close as you can to your
lash line a good thing we put on our
eyeliner it makes us a good base to
follow hey girls
we're almost there take the same black
gel liner in eyeliner brush and mix b19
slowly draw your lower lash onto your
lower lids or you can just take
individual lashes and glue them on one
by one
it's your choice next take a volumizing
mascara brush to blend your natural lash
and your false lash I'm using Zazou from
NYX make sure those lower lashes are
real defined I'm using the mascara in
pinup tease okay so I decided to
intensify this look and make it a little
bit more sultry a little bit more of a
deeper set looking eye so I went in and
I added more of a thicker line to the
crease what do you prefer
let's get those mod lips so I'm first
taking the NYX wonder pencil in dark and
applying it all over my lips
unlike the olden days we don't need the
foundation to make our lips match our
face so we'll just go ahead and apply it
all over our lips
next we're going to pick up the NYX soft
matte lip cream in London this lip cream
smells like flavored coffee in the
morning I don't know if you like
flavored coffee but I love it it's my
favorite drink in the morning and I just
wanted to eat this lipstick our face is
pretty simple even down to our lips so
this calls for some pretty pink blush
I'm using the NYX stick blush in
Magnolia and just dabbing it on with my
finger let's brighten up the highest
points of our face with a powder
highlighter I'm going to use the NYX
mosaic powder and apply it to the tops
of my cheeks and the middle of my
forehead now your look is complete and
your boxing mod girl okay so back to the
story she heard a gust of wind and went
to go see what the noise was about then
she noticed these beautiful colorful
flowers that day something changed
inside of her that beamed with life she
noticed the next be fabulous Mara all
she could do is admire her color but
then she noticed the window was open
and it was in color and she knew that if
she went out that window her life would
forever be hi Johnny
