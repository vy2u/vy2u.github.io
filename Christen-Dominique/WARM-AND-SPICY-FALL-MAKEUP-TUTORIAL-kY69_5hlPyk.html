today I am in my element I'm back home
it's my first makeup tutorial on YouTube
in November like regular basic B makeup
tutorial I'm very happy to be doing this
I miss it so much I was like what am I
gonna do first of all I was like okay so
I've been doing so many crazy videos
what in the world am I gonna do like
what makeup look Ryan gotta come back at
I was unboxing and I found the kylie
burgundy palette and I was like yes this
to me screams November I'm gonna be
showing you how to get this look I feel
like it's a pretty spotlight eyeshadow
look and it just highlights your eyes
and just brings in something to your
eyes that is so flirty and warm and
sultry at the same time I love it so so
much and I know you guys are going to
love it so if you want to learn how to
get it then keep watching I'm just going
to go ahead and jump into the foundation
concealer so I'm going to be using the
Clinique beyond perfecting foundation
and concealer I don't have to use an
extra concealer because it's already
acting as both so I am very excited to
use this my first time trying it this is
actually provided to me by Clinique
thank you guys so much for sending it
out so I can try it let's go ahead and
start to put this stuff all over my face
this acts as both concealing and a
foundation so it has a really good
coverage and I don't have to I use like
an extra layer of makeup on my face so
this is this me super full coverage
12-hour wear and it has a doe foot
applicator which makes it easy to apply
I love these dofor applicators I'll go
ahead and work that onto my face this is
the number four cream would you need to
do little lines
I like the doe foot applicator because
you can cover more space with it and
it's just a lot easier you know it's
precise so now I'm just going to work it
into my skin with a beauty
I like the coverage and I also like that
it doesn't feel like it's weighing down
my skin because it is very full coverage
you can tell it like cleared everything
up like that but it also doesn't feel
like it's heavy so I like that love full
coverage foundations because they make
your skin look so flawless but if it
doesn't feel but if it feels like a full
coverage thick heavy layer of makeup I
won't use it I don't care how flawless
it is I'm only going to use it for
Halloween looks you know I mean so I
wanted to feel comfortable when I'm
wearing my makeup and this is one of
those foundations where you're going to
forget you have it all right now I'm
gonna go into my eyebrows I'm just gonna
comb them up first I'm going to be using
my favorite brow pencil which is the
precise in my brow pencil from benefit
so I'm just going to comb them and then
I'm going to fill them in as I fill in
the sparse areas I also brush through
them with a sweet just to make sure that
everything is blended in there
so now that I'm done with my brows I'm
going to go ahead and set my lid area
just so that everything is nice and
clean smooth and it'll be easier to work
on I'm going to take this Sigma blending
the e25 brush and I'm going to take my
Kat Von D powder I'm going to go ahead
and pop this on to the brow and then and
work it down all the way to the bottom
of the lid this is going to work as a
really nice base it's going to set this
area so that there isn't any creasing in
the lid space and I'm also going to just
even everything out and I'm just going
for a very natural brow bone so base
powder works just fine for this I'm
focusing more of the brow powder right
underneath the brow bone so I want this
area to look very clean and defined so
I'm going to go ahead and pop this shade
right here it says the shade name is
going to be penny but I think it's naked
I feel like it's switched but we're just
gonna call it penny I guess so I'm going
to pop that on right on the brow bone
and I'm going to stop this right before
it gets to the crease I wish this had a
mirror in it I feel like it needs one
but it's okay now that we got the brow
pretty much done I'm going to go into
the lid space I'm going to take Beach
right here this is going to be our base
shade and I'm going to start to work
that on the lid and on the crease and
i'm just using windshield wiper motion
motions just going back and forth to
kind of blur the edges so anything that
we put on top of this is going to look
nice and warm and what I like to do is
take a clean brush just to make sure
that we have no harsh lines clean
blending brush I'm using today is the
morphe r39 brush so the next color I'm
going to pick up is this one right here
this is naked but again it could be
penny either one because I feel like it
would be penny it would make sense if it
was penny but it says naked so we're
going to pick this one up right here and
I'm going to start to work that from the
lid to the crease
so what I'm going to do now is take my
morphe 514 brush and start to work this
area a little bit further up to the
crease I don't want to bring all of that
I shadow up all the way to the crease
with this densely packed brush because
then that's going to look really crazy
really fast it's gonna be really hard to
blend out so I'm gonna go with this
little bit and then we'll work it all
around just so that we can get a nice
soft blend you know what I mean
really be my mommy Sassoon you know what
I mean jelly bean she says things like
that I'm barely putting any pressure
down on the brush so I'm holding it way
far back out here please ignore ratchet
Rachel nail right here we are just going
to ignore her I'm going to take my brush
with a very soft like I'm barely
pressing down so I'm holding in the back
when you hold in the back you don't put
down as much pressure as when you're
holding it like this like really close
to the front so I'm putting my hand way
back here and then I am taking some of
that shadow and working it upwards
towards the brow bone in circular
motions this really soft circular
motions and then bring it in bringing it
around the inner crease area right here
if you close your eye you can see where
you need to blend also you might want to
open your eye just to see how it falls
on your lid you want this part to be
very smoked out soft and blurry you just
want you want to look like you took the
blur too much
so now I'm gonna go ahead and go way
down here to this shade this is almond
and I'm going to use a morphe 503 brush
and I'm just going to pick that up and
start to work this on to the crease as
well I'm also going to work this shade
right on to the inner corners right in
here I really focus and pack on the
shadow right in this area so I want it
to be a little bit darker on the outer
and inner part of the lid I'm actually
not connecting these two because when I
close
my eyes you can't really see it and when
I open it it's just like a soft
connection already so I don't need to go
any further with that so I'm going to
leave it where it's at and then I'm
going to go ahead and bring it in right
in here take a clean fluffy brush and
start to blend out the edges in the next
shadow I'm really excited about this was
kind of like the hot spot right here I
really it was excited to use this one
the burgundy shade in the palette and
the reason why I wanted to use the
palette was because of this shade mainly
when I go ahead and pack it on with my
Mac 239 and work that onto the outer and
inner part of the crease for the center
of the lid I'm going to take this shade
right here this is called Dubai I feel
like I'm lying to you guys telling
because I feel like they should be
switch like the names are switched but
it's fine just going to take the other
side of this brush right here and I'm
going to pop it into Dubai and I'm going
to pop it right onto the center of the
lid just so that it acts like a little
spotlight it's just like highlighting
your a lid it looks so pretty I already
love it so I'm going to go ahead and do
the other side I like that these are
very pigmented and there's not a lot of
fallout okay so now I'm going to work
everything I did on the top and working
on to the bottom so I'm going to do is
take this side right here and start to
work it on the lower lash line I'm
actually going to take this little baby
fan brush into the Sigma lash fan yo4
brush and what I'm going to do is take
that maroon color actually I'm going to
take let me show you I'm going to first
take this shade right here and I'm gonna
work that onto the lower lash line
first oh my god it gets so perfectly
right on the lash line I'm going to
bring it all the way into the inner
corners of the eye somebody actually
tweeted me about this brush or like you
always ask for a fan brush for your
lower lashline and here it is so I'm
happy they made it I just if I were to
make my own fan brush for the lower lash
line it would be a little
a bit more fluffier just a little bit so
that you can really smoke it out if you
wanted to okay so now I'm going to take
this brush right here and see how I'm
making it into a little fluffy fan brush
it's a little bit thicker and just going
to help blend out the edge and now I'm
going to go ahead and take that really
pretty burgundy color and I'm going to
work that on the lower lash line I'm
going to add just a little bit of this
pigment in the center of the spotlight
just because this is max Rose pigment
looks like this and I'm just going to
add a little bit just to see what it
looks like I'm very curious to see what
its gonna look like so I just got to do
it I'm just going to lay that right on
top just to bring a little bit more
light in this area and then I'm going to
go ahead and take the honest Asya liquid
gold metallic luster liner and we'll
work that right on to the waterline this
would also look really pretty as like an
inner corner highlight now I'm going to
add some mascara this is the new mascara
from Mac it's called false lashes it's a
really cute handle apply pretty generous
coats of mascara to the lashes like I
could wear no lashes with this but I'm
just gonna add some because of course I
want that extra volume but oh my god
this is a good one
okay so now that we're done with the
mascara I'm going to go ahead and pop on
these lashes these are some new lashes
that I got they're called
lash boss the box looks like this the
style Kate very pretty and wispy so I'm
going to take these guys right here I'm
so I'm going to be using the Estee
Lauder
Victoria Beckham collection bronzer
looks like this the mirror is really
really nice called Java Sun it's a nice
matte warm bronzer I'm just going to
warm up my cheek and temple area and
then for the blush I'm going to be using
this Smashbox blush collection but I'm
going to go ahead and
pick up true flush pop it on to the
apples of my cheeks I'm using my morphe
53 brush and then I'm going to work it
back into my hairline right into my hair
just so that it looks a little bit more
natural and then for the highlight I'm
going to be using this highlight palette
right here the new glow kit from honest
nausea and I found the most gorgeous
highlight whites and I'm going to be
using my morphe 510 and I'm going to
pick up some of white sand and just pop
it on to the tops of my cheek bone put
some on my nose and that is it for the
face I'm going to go ahead and move on
to the lips and for the lips we're going
to be using a new Kylie lip kit this is
the shade moon and I'm just going to lie
on my lip if I don't like the
combination of the lip and the eye so
add on to it
contempo I feel like this is a little
bit more pinky I'm just gonna layer it
on top so I'm just going to choose this
is stone from dose of colors me see what
that looks like
I always prefer to add on top and add
more because then you create your own
custom color or the center the list and
we go for something nude I'm thinking
Jeffery stars I'm nude in the center of
the lip so if I can find that that's
what I'll be using and actually see it
right now so I will be that I'm going to
pop that on to the center of my lips
okay so now I'm just going to layer on
the Too Faced lip injection and this is
