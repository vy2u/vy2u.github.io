hey guys and welcome to my nighttime
routine I'm coming home from a meeting
today so this is what I usually do when
I'm just coming home from a long day of
meetings and I just immediately take off
my shoes because I cannot stand being in
heels or walking in heels I'd rather be
in flats all day every day furry
slippers so I immediately change get
comfortable and then I head to the
restroom and put my hair up I am living
that short hair struggle right now so
nothing my hair can never be in a
ponytail right now in my life that's how
it feels so I have to put a ton of bobby
pins in and then I head over to my high
mirror and I just want to say a big
thank you to high mirror for partnering
up with me in this video because this
mirror is super cool and I can't wait to
show you what it does this is a really
cool high tech mirror that assesses your
skin and you can also listen to like
Spotify on it and watch music videos or
YouTube videos so what I do if I'm not
taking a shower because usually if I
take a shower I listen to Spotify on
this but if I'm just like brushing my
teeth taking my makeup off I'll catch up
on my favorite YouTube videos and then
I'll rip my lashes off because that's
the best feeling in the world
and then I will take off my eye makeup
with this a Lancome eye makeup remover
and what I do is I soak a cotton pad let
it sit on my eye for about five seconds
and then I'll softly rub my hand my
finger into my eyeball just completely
takes it away and then I grab my
Neutrogena wipes remove all of the rest
of my makeup for my face and this is my
oh my god this cleanser is amazing you
guys it's from so health it's my
favorite cleanser right now and I use my
Clarisonic just to get all the gunk off
from the day and then to add the
moisture back into my skin I'm using
touch' salt cream which actually my high
mere help me get the products that I'm
using right now because it helps you
analyze your skin and tells you if your
skin is dry or not and what proxy should
use to and I just use the it cosmetics
under my eyes
I go back to the high mirror and analyze
my skin again for the end of the night
to see if it's improved and it'll tell
you if you like how many dark spots you
have or wrinkles or you know acne and
then it'll tell you through getting
closer to your goal which is so cool and
super helpful after that's done I had to
family time we already ate dinner and
stuff as soon as we came to before we
came home we went to go eat and then I
just watched TV with the fam and then
right when Fresh Prince comes on I know
it's Jaden's bedtime so I'm like I'd
give him a few minutes and I'm like all
right come on we gotta go
head to Jaden's room put him to bed
before I put on the bed I always read
him a book or actually I tried to read
him a book but he's like no I'm reading
so that's kind of cool I'm glad that he
loves to read
after we finished reading we always pray
every night and then he is done for his
day and I can go and live you know my
best life
head over to the kitchen and make some
tea for myself right now I'm currently
loving this caramel apple dream tea it's
like holidays in a cup I love it so so
much you don't even need sugar for this
by the way just letting you know it's
just so so good and then I'll head over
to my room light our candles make it
super romantic just kidding it's a very
very regular is very normal
we watch our shows right now I am loving
white famous it is my current favorite
show I just finished Riverdale I've been
watched
Riverdale like crazy Caesar is obsessed
with his daughter boba and Jayden put
her a bow on her earlier just just for
this video just for you guys he dressed
her up and then we took it off
afterwards but we always cuddle with
boba we're always fighting her who over
who gets her she's like a bear with no
face bear with of the flattest face on
earth and we literally sleep with her so
after we're all cuddled in bed I turn
off the light and that's it I love you
guys so much thank you guys for watching
I hope you enjoyed my nighttime routine
and into the next video bye Dolly's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
