channel and if you are new to my channel
I've actually never done this part
before but we're gonna try it today my
name is Kristen domine and this is my
little home on YouTube right here I'm
gonna be showing you how to get this
very cozy warm look that I have on my
face perfect for the holidays that are
coming up when you want to look glam
with the fam and take pictures you know
they're gonna be posting it on Facebook
grandma aunt mom
everybody's gonna be posting your
pictures on Facebook so you want to look
good this is a really really pretty look
I think I'm actually gonna be wearing
this by going down to Houston to visit
my family next week and so I'm super
excited and I will probably be wearing
this look right here super easy to do by
the way anybody can do it it looks like
you're ready to eat a turkey and some
stuffing and maybe my mom's broccoli and
cheese casserole I'm so excited for that
anyways before we get into the video
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
and hit that notification bell so you
can be a part of the quad family and
without further ado let's get on with
this video why I'm going to start off
with my eyes are into my brows prime my
face did all that stuff and leave the
foundation for a little bit later I'm
gonna put on the NARS Cannell this is
light 2.75 so I'm gonna start with that
first and just use that as a primer
actually since we're here I'm just gonna
go ahead and conceal under the eyes I've
never really done this before but I am
concealing before foundation we're gonna
break my own rules today because I
usually don't like doing this before
foundation because I like to have an
even base first and then fill in the
spots that need a little extra help but
today you know what we're changing it up
it doesn't look as scary as it did
before I'm gonna go ahead and use this
this is the new morphe dare to create
39a palette looks like this it is very
large
and it has all these shadows in it a lot
of Browns greens so I'm just gonna take
a blending brush a crease color for me
starting in the crease just makes
everything look a little bit better the
canvas and sunder mix these two guys
together they're gonna be friends now
and pop that into the crease this is
gonna be our transition shade this is
perfect for a smoky eye the fizz is a
first step into a beautiful smoky eye
for the lid color I'm gonna go in with a
flat shader brush I like using flat
shader brush because they apply a lot
more pigment at one time and it's flat
so it's gonna cover more space at one
time so what I'm gonna do is take mm
let's see we got a big selection here
this shade right here this is cut crease
all the way down through the inner
corner work it up a little higher bring
it down to the end of the lid then you
can go back and forth in these little
wiggling motions just to make sure it's
really blended into the skin I make sure
you get really close to the lash line so
that you don't have any skin showing
right through here
I'm gonna be careful with how high I
bring it up because if you bring it up
too high it could look like a messy eye
somebody just hit me in the face kind of
I I have this transition shade blending
brush right here on hand so that I can
soften all the edges as I go up and this
is gonna tell me if I'm going too high I
can kind of gauge how high I want this
to go I'll have only one technique that
I do for my for my crease I don't just
go back and forth like this I don't just
go in circles like that sometimes I do a
little bit of in-between so I'll go back
and forth circles you know just find
what works for you and find where you're
comfortable with holding your brush
you'll notice when you play with your
brush a little bit more and your
eyeshadow
you'll notice that your eyeshadows gonna
come out a little bit softer and cleaner
with different ways that you hold your
hand and the different pressure you play
with your brush you just have to play
around with it but this is called mass
you can see as we go darker it's very
gradual the darkest shade will be at the
very bottom of the lid so the next brown
I'm gonna take is this one right at the
bottom this one right here and this is
gonna go on the very bottom of the lash
this is a dark brown smokey eye so you
really want to make sure we coat that
lid like a smaller brush to blend the
edges out because you can see they look
crazy I'm gonna blend those out and
these short little circular motions I
might go back and forth with this too so
what I'm gonna do is just a little bit
of a lighter shade right up here and
this is my Kat Von D it's just a
refillable pan for the Kat Von D shade
and light palette this is lyric it's
that yellow kind of undertone Oh messy
crazy hair back there I'm gonna take
that right along the brow bone this is
gonna really make the brow shape pop as
well as that whole eye shadow look it's
gonna look really nice and put together
now I'm just gonna add a wing to this
look and I will have everything listed
below that I use in this video today so
you guys can get the exact look that I'm
doing these are the hooda boot Budda
Budda these are the huda beauty fair
lashes these are one of my favorite
lashes alright my lashes are on now I'm
gonna work on the lower lash line I'm
just gonna go in to this shade right
here and I'm gonna work that right on
the lower lash line take it all the way
in and I'm just gonna do a light wash of
this color right under the lower lash
line add some mascara I'm gonna take a
batter up from the balm it's a long
wearing eye shadow stick in the shade
moonshot I'm going to pop that on the
lower lash
and you can either leave this bear at a
nude I'm adding this because I don't
want my eyes to look too closed off so
I'm gonna just open them up a bit
for the foundation I'm gonna take the
Velvet Matte skin tint from NARS this is
in the shade grown grown lend light 3
yeah you guys can you read that for me
so little goes a long way I'm just gonna
take that dot it around
it says skin tint but to me this is more
like a full coverage foundation and it
has an SPF of 30 which is awesome and
then I'm just going to conceal my under
eyes with the NARS radiant creamy
concealer in Cannell light 2.5 and it
really just worked make sure you don't
cover up that lower lash line which is
why I kind of like doing this after I do
my concealer but since we started at
first we're double concealing this
bronze are right here and start to warm
up my face
and then to contour I'm going to take
the Natasha Turner net contour sculpting
powder
and then with the rest of my face I'm
gonna keep it very natural and warm it's
already warm from all the bronzer so now
I'm going to take this peach perfect
from Too Faced the setting powder and
actually the setting powder is pretty
amazing it gets rid of any fine lines
underneath your eyes so this stuff is
awesome and it smells so good ahead and
use my Beauty Blender the Beauty Blender
I used to apply my entire face so it's
kind of damp which kind of works out for
us I'm gonna look all the way up to the
heavens so that we don't get any
creasing under our eyes and just Pat it
in there like that
I'm gonna go in with cork from Mac right
here this guy and I'm aligned my lip
really quick without talking
and then I'm gonna go over the lip with
the NARS above it lip glide in the shade
strip for the highlight I'm gonna go
with Ofra it's the nikkietutorials glow
goals highlighter it is beautiful pop it
on the cheekbone right there nose
