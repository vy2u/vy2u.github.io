today I'm gonna do the what's on my
iPhone video so you can see like what
apps I use for picture reading on my
Instagram I get a lot of questions on
that some games I play when I'm really
bored also today I'm going to show you
the makeup I have on and to see maybe if
you want a tutorial on it so let's get
started so I have the iPhone 6 actually
didn't know that I was gonna get it my
husband kept telling me you know let's
just wait let's not get that one
buh-buh-bah he came home with it he has
someone to he has the space great and he
got me the gold in a white one he did
give me this pink cover on it and I
don't know I I don't mind it
such a nice phone you don't want to
cover any part of it but it's so
slippery I feel like I will definitely
drop it and I am known for cracked for
dropping my phones and having them crack
a little bit so and I also have this
screen protector on I heard that it
scratches really easy so perfect because
it probably all it probably would be all
scratched it would probably be all
scratched up anyways so yeah I'm
probably gonna have it for a while
because it has a lot of protection on it
or my screen saver is Jayden Jaden's my
son for those of you who have been
asking and so to open the phone I just
use my thumb I have my messages photos
camera clock on the first line and then
weather which I hardly use notes out for
my Instagram maybe I should make a video
about how I post my Instagram pictures
and details because this is actually
from my Instagram so what I do is I like
to write whatever I'm gonna do in the
caption here and then I copy it paste it
or like video ideas and then all my
navigation I have Google Maps maps and
Yelp I usually just use Google Maps to
get me around wherever I need to go or
Yelp if I'm looking for like a
restaurant or something or to get
reviews on like a place and that's what
I use there and then health I haven't
really used this but I saw it and mamma
mias iPhone video and it looked pretty
interesting so I'm going to check it out
but obviously I haven't used it and it
just keeps track of your
measurements fitness nutrition all that
stuff that's cool to have and my
reminders I don't use Google downloaded
the app because this is my favorite
search engine it's the best one I think
so I have that there and remote you can
actually a control actually lost my
Apple TV remote so this helps out a lot
so now I can use my Apple TV again and
settings my photography I have like the
apps I used to edit my pictures for
Instagram
I have phase two so if I have a pimple I
like clever it up here with patch
I'll just patch it let me show you a
picture that I probably need to edit
sure that's blurry too um anyways so I
just get patch a zoom into it this is
obviously a really blurry picture and
then it just does that I try to get it
as similar to the skin as I can and I
just do that and then if I need to
smooth it out I'll use the smooth button
and if you do it too smooth and that
looks just like a big plate OE face I
use this little smoother here with one
drop it's not as crazy and that's pretty
much all I do on face tune and then
after light I fix the lighting on my
camera and my pictures and here I'll
just like fix the contrast and the
brightness and saturation and stuff like
that so so after light is amazing let's
try to do something with it
here is mine in hearts picture and
usually all I use really is this little
button here
I like brighten it up a little bit if
it's too dull do anything there I think
this picture is pretty good so I don't
really need to do much with it but and
then I'll use like contrast to make the
blacks blacker saturation just to give
me some color without looking like I'm
Orange and then I'll just go down the
line and mess with this and then
sharpening I always sharpen my pictures
and that's pretty much it for this guy
square ready in case my picture is a
little too large and cuts off some of it
I use square ready to make it fit an
Instagram pic play post this is where
you can do like some video play video
and show pictures at the same time you
have my youtube and YouTube studio and
here you could just look at your
analytics your comments you can comment
easier then I have YouTube I live on
YouTube check out my subscriptions and
see what's going on
guess the body part challenge I have to
watch that do any of you guys watch
psycho soprano or Miranda sings I think
she is so funny and she also oh oh my
god so I watch more zoella on her beauty
channel and more zoella this is her
vlogging channel and pointlessblog tv's
alfie which is her boyfriend actually
thinking of doing a vlog channel and
trying to do the 30 day challenge on in
November to just vlog every day I don't
know if I should do that or not you guys
let me know if you'd actually watch that
and then here I have my social networks
I have Facebook and just check my
notifications I really don't get on
Facebook too much and like my newsfeed
that's my friend she lives in Miami she
just moved to Miami
she's a actress model and so I just
check out my family that's that one and
then my twitter which of course you guys
can always tweet me and then you know
I'll snap a picture of your tweet and
put it at the end of my video and see
what some and see what some of you guys
are doing and then I just got Google+ I
think it came with a phone because I'm
like I didn't download it unless my
husband did I don't know but I just
recently started to get notifications
from Google+ which is a really cool
because I never got them before and I
get to read your guys's comments on here
so that's really cool so yeah I have
that and as soon as you guys comment it
instantly gives me a notification so I
get to keep up with those in real time
and followers is an app a just sometimes
look at to see how many actual Instagram
followers I have
because you know on Instagram it doesn't
show you the exact number so I go on
here and look at that and then I have of
course Instagram and she's gorgeous yeah
I just look at pictures and or get
inspiration
well like I look at your comments anyway
so yeah and then I'll like look at this
little guy to see if I've been tagged
anywhere and then pages this is where
I'll check my Kristen Dominic Facebook
so here I'll just see how many how many
of you liked my picture let's be honest
and see your guys is like comments this
is just a facebook Messenger and for
games
I really don't play very many games the
main game I play which I get super
addicted to is card the Kardashian game
and this is my this is my little avatar
I'm out of runway right now trying to
own there I collected some money from it
just picking it up off the floor and oh
I'm not I just started I'm on level 5 I
only have C this is a Google+
notification from you guys so I get to
see them instantly and I just started so
I only have five hundred and forty two
dollars well actually I bought this
dress which is pretty expensive
do any of you guys play this game it's
so addicting okay so now I'm just gonna
get out of this one and I really I
really don't I really don't play candy
crush but I just randomly got it the
other day because everybody has it so I
wanted to see what it was all about
I've safari which I don't use much I
just use my Google have PlayMemories
which this is what's connected to my
next five camera that I have that I just
started taking pictures with and and so
I get my pictures on to PlayMemories and
that's how I'm able to post them on
Instagram and here's my Pandora I
usually just put it on shuffle because
I've been that's on utilities which I
hardly ever use except for maybe the
calculator and I don't know oh and then
there's iMovie GarageBand all these cool
apps that I don't use at all so I put
them under a random folder that I never
use so it's there here I have my phone
my FaceTime I usually like to FaceTime
with my mom
and my cousin Sabrina I wonder if she'll
face time with me right now let's try
Sabrina's my little cousin she's like 16
years old but we're so close and I
