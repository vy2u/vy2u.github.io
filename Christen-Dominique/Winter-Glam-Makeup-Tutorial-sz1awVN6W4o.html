able to out that gonna stop its ocean
carpet guys welcome back to my channel
so today we are filming a winter makeup
look using dun dun dun the Kylie Royal
Peach palette I'm so so excited for this
freakin palette actually try to
replicate this look right here because I
fell in love with it so so much I was
like okay how do I get this on my
eyeballs I think I did it this palette
was made for brown eyes if you have
brown eyes you meet this palette in your
life girl if you want to learn how to
get this look then keep watching though
I'm going to go ahead and put this cover
effects calming primer on I have been
traveling a lot you guys know that I'm
actually traveling again next week and I
just got back this week so it's it's a
really crazy month for me I'm getting so
many breakouts I'm actually gonna have
another facial this week so I'm very
excited or next week when I come back
from Philadelphia because mapping a
meet-up
in Philadelphia with MAC Cosmetics I'm
so excited I've never been to
Philadelphia so if you're from there let
me know in the comment I posted the
location and the time on my Instagram so
in case you guys are wondering you can
head over to my Instagram I'm going to
use my Estee Lauder double work so I
know that's full coverage the redness is
real on my face so I'm gonna cover that
up
I'm sure you work your foundation down
into your neck and I'm magically back
with brows actually did them a little
bit thicker today I don't know if you
guys notice you do look a little crazy
to me right now because I have no other
makeup on my face
so yeah I'm super excited to try Kylie's
new palette the royal peach palette
which packaging is on point I'm going to
open it up now it's a very pretty
palette color coordination makes sense
the shimmers and the mattes makes sense
I just I'm really excited to put this on
my eyeballs all my eyelids don't put on
your eyeballs it's not safe and it also
comes with a brush which so first Kylie
brush that I use like an actual
eyeshadow brush feels pretty good and
I'm actually looking over at my new more
few brushes that I just got in and
you're like almost the same oh except
this is more of them this is more of a
rose gold versus a gold well you see
that they're so similar the brush is
pretty similar Wow so I'm going to start
off with sorbet which is this shade
right here and I'm going to work that
all over my lid and just pack it onto
the lid all the way up to the brow bone
and this is a really pretty matte peachy
shade I'm also just gonna wrap it around
the bottom of the lash line as well I'm
going to take it around I always like to
squeeze my brush like this so it's like
a little fluffy fan brush and work that
around the lash line the lower lash line
I swear I need to make my own fluffy
little fan brush for the lower lash line
I'm loving this peachy shade it's so
pretty
I'm going to go ahead and take this
color right here which is peachy so it's
this darker matte shade of peach and I'm
going to work that right above the
lighter peach color that we just put on
and I'm going to take my new little more
few brushes that I just opened today I'm
going to actually take this brush right
here so see morphe doesn't have a number
on
that's weird this one right here and I'm
going to work that a right above this
one so I'm going to make sure to pack
that on all over the lid and blend it
back and forth using windshield wiper
motions and you can kind of buff out the
edges like that you want that pretty
peach light peach shade to peek through
this one so try not to go completely
over it just kind of layering on top
like so
and then if you happen to lose some of
the lighter peach just take the brush
that you use to put it on first and just
work it back in there and kind of you
can also buff out the edges with this
brush it works really good to make them
look smooth this is the stepsister of
the eyes because this one just has so
many weird folds in it she always ate
hot cheetos and bean dip she is me
actually this kind of looks like a hot
cheetos inspired look I also take that
color around the lower lash line I'm
going to take this brush right here
and I'm going to take this light taupe
shade and work that into the crease to
give it some dimension so just going to
these windshield wiper motions to just
intensifying that crease shadow I'm
going to take this color on the outer V
of my eye so we're going to create a V
and then we're going to bring it halfway
in to the crease so it looks like that
starting to look more and more like a
flamin hot cheeto that's pretty
oh my god I'm falling in love with this
look so I'm going to go in with Dutchess
this shade right here I'm going to put
it on top of my lid and I go ahead and
Pat that right on top of the lid color
so I'm gonna start in the middle I'm
gonna work that around
everywhere almost reminds me of a dirty
penny and actually I'm going to go into
the middle of my lid with this shade
right here which is clean B and pop it
on to the center of the lid just to add
a little bit more light here and I'm
going to keep it right on this Center
for the bottom lashes for the bottom
lash line I'm going to go in with that
really beautiful royal blue and I'm
going to work that very close to the
lash line I am back with my blue
eyeliner because I think I'm just going
to line the inner rim to see what that
looks like and I'm using my Lancome blue
eyeliner and then I'm going to take some
of that Brown wheezed earlier brown
shade is called sandy BTW if you were
wondering that was Boba scared me here
sandy shade I'm use a little bit of my
shape tape concealer from Tarte and
light medium put that underneath my brow
bone to intensify the brow bone and just
make look make look nice this is my
everything if you want to have clean
perfect brows if you want a clean
perfect eyeliner winged liner the m43 2
from morphe is the bomb.com I'm going to
go ahead and work that on my brow bone
and then with my finger I'm just going
to buff the edges out and that looks a
whole lot cleaner and now for the inner
corner I'm going to take sorbet that
light peachy shade and I'm going to work
it right in the inner corners and then
for the waterline I'm going to take a
black eyeliner and I'm gonna use this
Tarte double ended liner I'm going to
take the pencil side and I'm gonna line
the waterline next I'm just going to
make my lashes super super big and
fluffy so I'm going to take a really
good mascara if you're having trouble
with lashes or mascara try to find one
that's dry or you can just leave it out
for like a day leave it out for a couple
hours or even a day and it'll dry up a
little bit it actually works better than
a very wet feeling mascara so now I'm
going to put on some lashes I'm going to
use these flutter lashes and Kelsey
they're very pretty wispy fluffy looking
lashes so I'm going to put those on and
I will be right back okay I want to
darken up a little bit on the outer part
of the lash line so I'm going to take a
darker shade of something and actually
just got this new Urban Decay palette in
and it has a really nice dark brown
color right here I'm going to take
delete and I'm going to work that on the
outer part of my lash line with a little
pencil brush okay so I decided to take
this lash off eyelashes a little crooked
and again I want to deepen up the outer
lash line okay that's a lot better I
feel like it's a little bit more even
that is pretty much it for the eyes I'm
going to go ahead and move on to the
face you guys know this is my
ride-or-die concealer so I'm just gonna
put it on without saying anything
because I use it every single almost
video and then I'm just gonna do a
little bit of contouring with my makeup
forever
5:05 to seal everything in place I'm
going to take a new powder from the balm
that I just got the bombs packaging you
guys is so adorable it's not even funny
it's so so cute
this is their new powder foundation it's
called a photo bomb and I chose the
light/medium shade it's a pretty big
sized powder foundation and I'm going to
take that with my morphe y-1 brush and
I'm just going to lift it over again and
I'm going to start to work that into my
face it has some coverage in it which I
was not expecting to be that heavy but
I'm not mad at it
so keep the coverage coming season thank
you you take the shade right here and
I'm going to bronze up my skin with it
start to bronze up my cheeks bring it
around the temples and right above the
brow take this shade right here and I'm
going to pop that underneath my under
eyes I'm going to just set the
concealer in place right under my eye
and also kind of give my under eye a
brighter look bring it all along the
side of the nose just to slim down then
it was a little bit more anything that
has a little bit of a yellow undertone
to it I love I absolutely love to
brighten my under eyes because it is the
most flattering for all of medium skin
tones I'm going to use the Too Faced
sweet peach glow palette for my blush in
my highlight I'm going to take this
middle shade apply it to the tops of my
cheekbones and then I'm going to take
the highlight and I'm going to use this
one right here so pretty work that on
the top through the cheek tops of the
cheekbones go down the Cupid's bow and
above the brows okay I am feeling match
stripped down for this look I feel like
this is a really nice nudey brown color
and we're just not gonna talk anymore
I'm going to go over strip down with the
dose of colors undressed and it's like a
lighter nudie brown version of strip
down and it's a gloss and with this I
just kind of want a highlight like I
like my Cupid's bow like the center of
my lips
