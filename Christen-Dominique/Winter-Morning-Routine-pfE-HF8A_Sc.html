winter more actually you know what let's
just look at have to rewind this kind of
embarrassing actually
Christmassy vibes all over the place if
this intro is way better I usually go to
bed really really late so I wind up
waking up super tired and then I
realized I woke up way too early
two hours later now after a hundred
yawns later I get out of bed I can't
move on without showing you my
Christmasy socks can't do it then I just
got my new bedding I got it in and I
just moved into my new apartment
so I wanted to show you guys be making
my bed let's just be real right now I
like to brush my teeth in the morning as
soon as I get out of bed brush my teeth
get that nasty taste out of my mouth and
can we all just give it up give a big
emoji hand clap to this see inspired
Santa Claus right now perfect for the
restroom I saw it at t.j.maxx I was like
I have to have that because my restroom
needs Christmas love too and I'll wash
my face with a cleanser and to make sure
it's really rubbed in really good I will
do with this face dance which is part of
my routine you guys do that too right
it's normal right I've been using the
Tasha assault cream for my face oh my
god it's so good will literally give
your skin a silky feel I love it I
highly recommend it to anybody with very
dry skin and for my hair I'm just
leaving it down today I washed it
yesterday just putting it down in its
natural habitat or foundation today I'm
gonna be using the vanish cream
hourglass Foundation stick and then a
little bit of shape tape under the eyes
from Tarte benefit goof proof to fill in
my brows and I'm using this Maybelline
contour stick which is really creamy
and I really like the way it blends use
that to contour today and I'm not going
into too much detail on my makeup
because this isn't a makeup tutorial so
giving you a quick run-through of
everything I'm using I used to be aged
cosmetics on my eyes I use their marble
palette which I think it's a really
beautiful palette and I love BH because
they're so affordable and quality is
really good and then oh my god you guys
I'm obsessed with the Too Faced sweet
peach everything the palette the
highlight the blush the lip gloss and
love lashes I'm using the flutter lashes
in Kelsey they're really natural wispy
just really pretty and this is my look
for today and now that I'm all done it
is time for breakfast aka coffee
okay everything before this moment does
not count coffee before talk II actually
have a blue coffee mug that says that so
I just want to give a quick shout out to
my coffee mug for the inspo on this I've
said this before I will say it again
coffee is not coffee to me without
creamer my creamer is everything this
maple cinnamon pancakes candle is my
life it is so good from Bath and Body
Works you guys have to try it it smells
a delicious
I usually check my snapchat anyways
let's go ahead and get ready and um
today's outfit is not going to be a
Christmas sweater darn it it's just
gonna be a regular sweater and some
jeans okay times again change
yes that was like magic right I'm gonna
go ahead and put on these ugly Christmas
socks because why not now it's time for
boba to get in the Christmas spirit she
actually is fighting with me not to put
this thing on she did not like it
I took it right off of her but I thought
it was look cute and I wanted her to be
in the video and she's such a cute
little kitty so I put her in and she
walked around in it and honestly her fur
is just way too fluffy for outfits like
this because she just looks like a
muscle man in them so enjoy
and then last minute I put these antlers
on here and honestly she was not having
it she was like no I am done with you I
cannot even deal with you and then I put
him back on her because yes I am that
cat mom I needed a picture for snapchat
Heller you guys seem to like it I saw a
lot of you screenshot her on my snapchat
she's so she looks so grumpy I swear
she's like the happiest cat ever she
literally just sits around all day and
looks out the window that is her life
she doesn't even know she just sits
there enjoys life you can cuddle with
her you can pet her she won't move I
promise she's not very active but she's
super lovable and I love her so much
so after mike activities i like to write
down my video ideas for future months
and i'll look through my schedule make
sure I have my leak down pack and that's
pretty much what my day consists of in
my house if it's not filming and then
I'm going to go ahead and head out now
I'm gonna put on my booties these are
from Steve Madden they're super cute and
I love this crop top sweater from Lulu's
my jeans are actually from hot Miami
styles and I've had him for about a year
and I love them so much
Irie wear them all the time way too much
actually and I'm just gonna go about my
day but before I leave I'm gonna try not
to burn down my new apartment so that's
pretty much it
