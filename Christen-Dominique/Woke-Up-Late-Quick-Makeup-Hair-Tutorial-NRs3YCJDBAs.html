today I'm gonna be showing you how to
get ready like super fast this is one of
those where you woke up late and it's
your friend's birthday dinner or it's a
party and you need to look just a little
bit extra but I'm gonna show you how to
get there super quick tell you the
pointers to make it seem like it took
you about thirty hours and you were
comfortable you were had your music on
you were just taking your time when
really you had 20 minutes and bam you
are done I promise you you can do this
in 20 minutes and if you can definitely
adjust it to where you're comfortable at
all so I'm gonna give you a huge hair
tip when you're running out of time and
you need your hair to look right I'm
gonna give you some pointers on hair
makeup thank you - IG k for partnering
up with me in this video for their dry
hair shampoos because I love them they
are the cutest things and they're one of
my favorites so I'm gonna show you how I
use them which one I love so if you want
to see how I got this look right here
and this volume in my hair and no time
at all then don't forget to subscribe to
my channel and hit that notification bow
so you can be a part of the quad family
and without further ado let's get on
with this video you do is just wake my
face up a little bit by putting on a
little bit of this oil from tatcha
this is the gold Camilla beauty oil and
I just feel like rubbing that in
instantly gives you a boost and
sometimes I'll even skip primer if I
just do this it just makes a really nice
smooth surface for your foundation to
glide on top of no this is not one of
those kind of like I'm running late and
have to go to work or school this is
like I'm running late and I have my
friend's birthday dinner to go to
something more fun and just an
obligation that you definitely don't
want to miss I'm just gonna start
applying my foundation right away so the
foundation that I'm using is the Dior
forever in the shade 23 and I'm just
gonna pop that on really quick if my
Beauty Blender
and I literally just got spray-tanned
right now so this is probably way too
light for me but it's okay
okay so if I was in a hurry I would just
go ahead and pop on the concealer right
away I'm still gonna give my eye area
some time to dry down before I do my
brows because if I start doing my brows
now the pencil won't hold on to the skin
very easy it's just gonna slide over the
skin so I'm gonna wait to do my brows
I'm gonna go straight in with caramel
this shade right here work that right on
the crease area depending on your skill
level you could probably get away with
this within like 10 to 15 minutes but if
it'll take you a little bit longer you
can always customize what I'm doing to
fit where you're comfortable this is
actually really easy because it's just
one crease shade that you're doing and
then I'm gonna pop on hazelnut I'm gonna
take hazelnut all over my lids so that
one shade is gonna make a world of a
difference and automatically amp up our
looks so much faster so I'm gonna take a
flat brush and I'm taking hazelnut and
I'm gonna pop it all over the lid like
this and just take it all the way from
the inner corner to the outer smudge it
in the lash line you want to bring it up
until you hit the crease that bone right
here and then you just start to work it
and this is pretty pigmented shadow so
you don't need to go back too many times
and just work it like so this color
looks so beautiful on brown eyes or blue
so I'm just gonna take a little bit more
on the outer part of the eye and then
blend it out this is the brush that I
used for the crease so it's gonna help
really ease that hazelnut shade into the
caramel and voila you're done you don't
need to go any further I know you're not
gonna believe me but you're gonna look
like you actually took an hour or two on
your makeup one medium tone shade is all
you really need and then just using a
little bit more towards the outer
corners of the same shade is makes it
look like you use more than one color
this color is so rich and beautiful it
just really makes your
pop so if you just layer like one or two
layers you know a full-blown smoky eye
make sure there's no harsh lines on the
edges so use a very light hand and just
do circular motions really quickly so
now I'm just gonna move on to the lashes
I know this is going so fast but trust
me you don't really need that many steps
if you want to look glam so I'm just
gonna go ahead and grab my lash glue
blushes that I'm choosing are these guys
right here from house of lashes these
are the ikonics the reason I'm choosing
these lashes for tonight is because it's
kind of a flared out winged lash so you
don't really need a wing with these it
kind of does the drama and the lifting
of the eye for you this is all you
really need for your lashes and this is
what's gonna make you look super glam
right away so they are definitely gonna
add some drama super quick to your look
now while that's drying I'm just gonna
fill in like my brows really quick I'm
definitely gonna go back and fix them up
definitely using a pencil is so much
quicker than using anything else like a
pomade
well that's kind of drying on my eyes
I'm gonna go on my lower lashes take the
brush that has hazelnut on it and just
sweep it right underneath my lashes my
lower lashes so now I'm gonna go in with
a pop of color you either want to do
this on your lips or your lower lash
line so either a bold lip or a bold
lower lash line so what I'm gonna do is
take cold-brew from the Lahti palette
after the liner I'm just gonna pop on
some mascara to the lower lashes mesh my
tree lash with the false lash and I'm
sweeping the mascara on the very tip of
my real lashes and sweeping it up going
through the false lash so that it
connects together now I'm going to add a
pop of highlight to the inner corners so
for that I'm gonna take macchiato
even if you do like your bass first and
take your palette with you in your bag
and do the rest in the car in your uber
on your way you can definitely get it
everything done all in one palette so
that's a good thing about this palette
and it's definitely good for those type
of nights after that I'm gonna go ahead
and set my under eyes and brighten them
up just a tad bit more so I'm gonna take
vanilla cream right here in the palette
and just go right in that inner corner
and then for contouring if you have time
I'm just gonna contour my nose really
quick with mocha very lightly and you
can definitely skip this part but for me
I will fit contouring my nose in if I'm
going out for a pictures sake know I'm
gonna have to snatch the nose but I can
get away with just doing bronzer on my
face so I'm gonna take hazelnut and use
that on my cheeks as well I'm gonna take
it around the temple
and then just to make sure that we're
extra bright under our eyes and
everything is nice and soft around the
bronzer I'm just going to take a little
bit more a vanilla cream to soften of
the edges
and go right down the nose right here
and we've shaped them it was so quick
with the one palette that's crazy
now I'm just gonna do my highlight so
I'm just gonna take macchiato what I use
in my inner corners and use it right
so for the lip I'm just gonna take this
Kat Von D love Ludwig lipstick like so
so you can stop right there you can just
do that lip but I'm gonna go ahead and
add on at this gloss it's really
beautiful it's from pixie and Chloe
Morello she made this gloss it's the lip
icing in the shade cake it's so pretty
and shimmery I'm just gonna lay it over
the top of the center of my lip look at
that gold and this was just glam up any
look at any time of the day even if you
wear it on its own I feel like this
would be really pretty so that's pretty
much it for the makeup very fast quick
easy you can do a setting spray now the
hair so if you woke up and your hair is
a mess or if you haven't washed it in
like a day or two and it's just flat and
oily like mine right now
my trick is to use dry shampoo and
lately I have been loving these dry
shampoos from igk and not to mention the
packaging is extremely freaking cute I
am obsessed with packaging that's what
catches my eye and it's just the cutest
thing together these dry shampoos right
here are called the flight Club it's so
freaking cute there's jet lag direct
flight in first class and they have
really pretty packaging so this one is
called jet lag and this is the invisible
dry shampoo it's super lightweight this
is when you have maybe one or two days
of hair and it's not really that bad so
this one right here just gets rid of
mild dirt and oil in your hair then this
guy right here is called direct flight
to multitasking dry shampoo this one's
gonna give you that lift in your hair if
you're if you like volume which is
something that I love and I love to use
which I'm about to show you right now
it's gonna give you that boost and lift
in your hair it's also gonna absorb the
oils and this is a medium cleanse so if
you've if you've been out and about and
you haven't washed your hair maybe like
two days or three days then you might
want to use this guy right here and this
guy is good for normal to oily scalp so
keep that in mind and then the last guy
is the first class this is the charcoal
detox
a deep cleansing dry shampoo this is
when you haven't washed your hair and so
many days you're embarrassed to tell us
about this one is good for oily scalps
fine hair medium to thick coarse
textured hair any type of hair basically
you can even use this after a workout
you're gonna smell good your hair is
gonna feel good and it's gonna it's not
gonna look dirty so nobody will know
it's it'll be a secret the one that I'm
gonna use today is going to be the green
one because I want some lift in my hair
and it's been honestly maybe two days so
I feel like I'm just gonna go with this
guy right here so I just want a little
bit of a lip so when I'm ready to get
out and do my hair what I do
I'll have it straight first of all
because straight is the easiest less
time-consuming thing to do
so I'll just focus this on the scalp
doesn't leave any residue but I'll just
let it sit there I'm not gonna even work
it in yet and then separate it smells so
good and focus that one and do another
layer or my hair hits my crown and once
I've let it sit for awhile now I'll just
start to massage my head like this it
just gives you this blow-dried Airy kind
of look I've already have so much volume
in my hair and if you guys could tell
from when I started that's pretty much
all that I would do quick outfit and
head out of the house thank you guys for
watching I hope you enjoyed this video
if you liked it go ahead and give it a
big thumbs up and before I let you go I
want to remind you to have an open heart
and an open mind you never know who can
let in your life I love you guys so much
and I will see you in my next video bye
