awesome week today's video is going to
be a little different because I've never
made this type of video before but
basically I have noticed that life hack
videos have been quite the trend on
YouTube so I want to try it out for
myself
so basically I'm going to be showing you
guys different tips and tricks that you
can use in the kitchen while you're
cooking and some of them are kind of
game-changing some of these I found on
Pinterest while some of them I've
actually been using for a long time so
it's kind of a combination of both but
yeah they're really helpful and I'm
really excited to show you guys and of
course if you guys enjoyed this video
please give it a big thumbs up and
subscribe to my channel by clicking over
here to check out more of my videos
every Friday let's get started if you
have any leftover lemon wedges or lemon
peels don't throw them out throw them
into your sink disposal because it will
help to kill off bacteria and make your
sink smell fresh okay this food hack is
mind-blowing so if you're wanting to cut
a mango start off by cutting it long
ways and rather than trying to peel off
the skin just use any type of cup or
glass and you can easily slide out the
mango and then slice it up next time
you're cooking an overeasy I could try
to crack it inside of an onion ring it
keeps it from dripping all over the
place and accidentally breaking the yolk
when you're flipping it over so it just
makes the whole process easier and if
you don't like onions then you can very
easily just peel it off of the edges
when you're placing it on the toast
YouTube is filled with so many zucchini
noodle recipe video ideas and I'm sure
you guys have seen that fancy tool
called a spiralizer but if you don't
have one at home you can totally still
make noodles by just using a peeler
rather than squeezing lemon with your
fingers if you're trying to put some
into water instead squeeze the lemon in
between tongs it makes it so much easier
to get more out of your lemons you're
about to share some icecream with a
friend do you guys know you're going to
finish a pint instead of just spooning
it out and sharing it you can also just
run knife under hot water and cut
directly through the ice-cream and this
will actually create two little sideways
bowls so just stick some spoons in there
and bam you guys got yourself some
little icecream bowls all right so this
is actually the first time I tried this
hack but I was so impressed with it next
time you are trying to cut some little
cherry tomatoes try wedging them in
between two plates and just cutting
through all of them it actually works
and it actually saves so much more time
so this food hack might be helpful to
those of you who are trying to eat
healthier but it's basically to cook
with water which sounds like a crazy
idea because you're always told to use
oil but as long as you just keep a glass
of water on hand and continuously just
to drip it in there as the water burns
out it actually makes it really easy and
obviously very healthy and oil-free so
this food hack might seem a little
obvious but I never thought of doing it
before it's so smart so for those of you
who like to bake their own homemade
fries out of potatoes rather than
cutting it up just use an apple slicer
and it makes the most perfect fry wedges
and then you can just cut the middle
piece in half and buy them you got
yourself some fries in like four seconds
so if you have any leftover bottles you
can actually use them to help store your
food for the bags that don't have you
know zip locks or ties or anything like
that so basically what you do is you
pull it through and wrap it around and
then just tie it back up I clearly
didn't need it for what was inside but I
just want to show you guys this an
example think of soon like never in a
million years what's in your pan are you
still going to get these out like I
would need to go like this what about
like the bag clips well so that is it
for today's video I hope you guys
enjoyed it and if you try out any of
these food life hacks then please tweet
me or Instagram me pictures because I
want to see if you guys can also do them
and yeah I will see you guys for a new
video next week bye favorites of this
past month is belts I am having so much
fun with belts right now it was actual
never really thing that I got into but
the first one is from Nasty Gal it's a
black leather belt and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
