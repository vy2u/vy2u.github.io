the ten little secrets tag and I'm
really excited to do this because I
think they're really interesting
questions and I have nothing else to say
so I'm just gonna get right into it okay
so the first question is what is one
product that makes you feel like a
million dollars and that what for sure
has to be highlighter I'm going to show
you guys my favorite one it's by Mac and
it is called soft and gentle and it just
looks like this
but I would definitely have to say
highlighter just because I don't know I
wear it every single day it makes your
face just glow and look super like dewy
and shiny and glowy and you guys always
comment about it too you guys are always
like why is your skin always so glowy
you're glowing in this video and that is
always because I wear a highlighter this
would definitely make me feel like a
million dollars so number two is what is
your skincare secret it passed down
skincare tip I don't really have one but
I'd have to say whenever I do get a
random pimple anywhere on my face I
always use my Burt's Bees spot treatment
which you guys saw in one of my latest
videos so probably that whenever I get a
pimple I always put on the targeted spot
treatment and it goes away super fast so
I guess that would be my secret I'd
really have anything else it's really
say cuz I don't really do anything crazy
to my face
number three is share your haircare
secret I only comb my hair when it's at
least like 90% dry I never comb my hair
on its wet because my hair it's super
flat and thin and it gets knotty super
fast as you guys can tell it my hair
already looks super naughty and then
also I know that a lot of people talk
about this but once you're done taking a
shower if you blast your hair with cold
water it'll kind of lock in the shine
and make your hair look really shiny and
that also goes for drying your hair I
never really do use a hot setting for my
blow-dryer
I usually just blow-dry my hair with
cold air so I guess that is also kind of
a good I don't know okay so on to the
next question number four is what is
your biggest diet rule I always like
snack and eat just for a taste because
I'm not really hungry so before I eat
something I always ask myself am I
actually hungry or do I just want the
taste and that's kind of what stops me
from like snacking that too much so
number five is any workout tips and my
first one would probably have to be to
stay consistent because if you decide
that you want to start running and you
do it like um you know for a bunch of
days one week and then you miss the next
week and then you're too lazy the next
on and then you run again like you need
to stay consistent and just kind of like
you know just keep doing it like every
week but there it's only like twice a
week three times a week
just kind of keep staying consistent
with it because then you're going to
achieve like you know the goal that you
want to and you'll make a lot better
like progress if you're like you know
keep doing it you don't do it like off
and on so for example for me I've been
running actually a lot I probably say
around four to five times a week for the
past like month and a half or something
and now I actually enjoy running so
that's one of the great things about
staying consistent because I basically
my body has gotten used to like
incorporating running and working out in
my daily like lifestyle so I actually
want to run and if I don't I feel
sluggish and I'm just like dang I should
run today so that's what I really like
about like staying consistent because
you just get used to it and I enjoy it a
lot now so that's really helped me okay
so on to the next one
number six is which perfume is your
secret weapon I could not choose between
these two
these are super popular perfumes the
first one is people ajussi I got this
this Christmas and already out I have
like not a lot left um we're just really
sad but I love this perfume so much it's
I don't know I just love it it's so
sweet and it's such a girly perfume and
I always get compliments on it and then
the other one is the DKNY be Delicious I
love
smell so much it's really like tardy
like tart and I don't know it's like the
complete opposite of this which is why I
like it so I can like I don't know but
yeah I definitely get the most
compliments ranked those two and they're
just my all-time favorites
number seven is show us a clothing item
of yours which always turns heads
probably this shirt right here this is
one of the shirts that I got from
Florida it just as Clearwater and it's
super tie-dye
and I wore it the first day I got back
from Florida because it looked to give
up the tent because it was on me on and
this shirt definitely turned some heads
because it's really bright right it is
what is your most treasured piece of
Julie it would definitely have to be my
Tiffany and Co like little circle
bracelet I wear this pretty much every
single day of my life ever since I have
like gotten it and I just love it so
much it's so simple and I don't know I
it means a lot so I really like it I
think I got it for like my birthday like
years ago or something I'm not really
sure but I wear this pretty much every
day so it would definitely have to be
this one's number nine is who is your
style crush it would probably have to be
Lauren Conrad because obviously everyone
loves her style but also I do like some
of Selena Gomez's outfits and Ashley
Tisdale has a cute style too and I don't
know I don't really look into that I
just kind of buy whatever I personally
like so I don't really have like a
specific crush you know what I'm saying
tell us something we don't know about
you
okay you guys like might laugh at me but
back in the day when I was like in third
grade or something
I stood fence do you guys think that is
that's like you having a sword it's it's
called an epee and it has a little
clicker at the end of the sword I don't
know if I've told you guys this before I
feel like I did I hope not but you know
you'd wear like the mask and like the
whole body suit and you would like look
all cool like
you know sword-fighting so I did that
for like three years with my brother and
my friend Adriana and it was it was
great I like quit after three years but
that was definite experience I'm pretty
sure I still have my sword man I should
have gotten and showed it to you guys I
think it's like in the garage but I'm
too lazy to get it but you know I had
like the EPI and everything so official
so yeah that is it for all of my ten
little secrets questions I hope you guys
enjoyed this tag and that's really it if
any of you guys want to do it just like
it down in the video response below and
I'll watch it so again that's it I tag
everyone and I hope you guys enjoyed
today's fail bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
