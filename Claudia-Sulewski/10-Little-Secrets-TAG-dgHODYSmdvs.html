the 10 little secrets tag and I'm really
excited to do this because I think
they're really interesting questions and
I've nothing else to say so I'm just
going to get right into it okay so the
first question is what is one product
that makes you feel like a million
dollars and that would for sure have to
be highlighter i'm going to show you
guys my favorite one it's my mac and it
is called soft and gentle and it just
looks like this but i would definitely
have to say highlighter just because um
I don't know I wear it every single day
it makes your face just glow and look
super like dewy and shiny and glowy and
you guys always comment about it to you
guys are always like why is your skin
always so glowy you're glowing in this
video and that is always because I wear
a highlighter this would definitely make
me feel like a million dollars so number
two is what is your skincare secret it
passed down skincare tip um I don't
really have one but i'd have to say
whatever i do get a random pimple
anywhere on my face i always use my
burts bees spot treatment which you guys
saw in one of my latest videos so
probably that whenever i get a pimple i
was put on the targeted spot treatment
and it goes away super fast so i guess
that would be my secret I'd really have
anything else it's really say cuz I
don't really do anything crazy to my
face number three is share your haircare
secret I only comb my hair when it's at
least like ninety percent dry I never
comb my hair when it's wet because my
hair is super flat and thin and it gets
naughty super fast as you guys can tell
it my hair already looks super naughty
and then also I know that a lot of
people talk about this but once you're
done taking a shower if you blast your
hair with cold water it will kind of
lock in the shine and make your hair
look really shiny and that also goes for
drying your hair I never really do use
the hot setting for my blow dryer I
usually just blow dry my hair with
cold air so i guess that is also kind of
a secret I don't know okay so on to the
next question number four is what is
your biggest diet rule I always like
snack and eat just for a taste because
I'm not really hungry so before I eat
something I always ask myself am I
actually hungry or do I just want the
taste and that's kind of what stops me
from like snacking that too much so
number five is any workout tips and my
first one would probably have to be to
stay consistent because if you decide
that you want to start running and you
do it like um you know for a bunch of
days one week and then you miss the next
week and then you're too lazy the next
one and then you run again like you need
to stay consistent and just kind of like
you know just keep doing it like every
week with our it's only like twice a
week three times a week I'm just kind of
keep staying consistent with it because
then you're going to achieve like you
know the goal that you want to and
you'll make a lot better like progress
if your like.you know keep doing it you
don't do it like off and on so for
example for me I've been running
actually a lot I'd probably say around
four to five times a week for the past
like month in half or something and now
I actually enjoy writing so that's one
of the great things about staying
consistent because I basically my body
has gotten used to like incorporating
running and working out in my daily like
lifestyle so I actually want to run and
if I don't I feel sluggish and I'm just
like tinea should run today so that's
what I really like about likes
inconsistent because you just get used
to it and I enjoyed a lot now so that's
really helped me okay so on to the next
one number six is which perfume is your
secret weapon I could not choose between
these two these are super popular
perfumes the first one is people at
juicy I got this this Christmas and
already out I have like not a lot left
um which is really sad but I love this
perfume so much it's I don't know I just
love it it's so sweet and it's such a
girly perfume and I always get
compliments on it and then the other one
is the DKNY be delicious I love this
smell so much it's really like tardy
like tart and I don't know its like the
complete opposite of this which is why I
like it
I can like no but yeah I definitely get
the most compliments wearing those two
and they're just my all-time favorites
number seven is show us a clothing item
of yours which always turns heads
probably this shirt right here this is
one of the shirts that I got from
Florida it just as clear water and it's
super tie-dye and I wore it the first
day I got back from Florida because it
looked given to tan because it was on me
on and the shirt definitely turned some
heads because it's really bright bright
eight is what is your most treasured
piece of Julie it would definitely have
to be my tiffany and co like little
circle bracelet I wear this pretty much
every single day of my life ever since I
have like gotten it and I just love it
so much it's so simple and I don't know
why it means a lot so I really like it i
think i got it for like my birthday like
years ago or something i'm not really
sure but I wear this pretty much every
day so it would definitely have to be
this one number nine is who is your
style crush um it would probably have to
be Lauren Conrad because obviously
everyone loves her style but also I do
like some of selena gomez's outfits and
ashley tisdale has a cute style too and
i don't know i don't really look into
that I just kind of buy whatever I
personally like so I don't really have
like a specific crush you know what I'm
saying tell us something we don't know
about you okay guys like my love me but
back in the day when I was like in third
grade or something ice to fence do you
guys think that is that's like um you
have like a sword it's it's called an
epee and has little clicker at the end
of the sword I don't know if I've told
you guys this before I feel like I did I
hope not but um you know you'd wear like
the mask and like the whole bodysuit and
you would like look all cool like you
know sword fighting so i did that for
like three years with my brother and my
friend
and it was it was great I like quit and
for three years but that was definite
experience i'm pretty sure i still have
my sword man I should have gotten and
showed it to you guys I think it's like
in the garage but I'm do is to get it
but you know I had like the FA and
everything so official so yeah that is
it for all of my 10 little secrets
questions um I hope you guys enjoyed
this tag and that's really it if any of
you guys want to do it just like it down
um and the video response below and I'll
watch it so yeah that's it I tag
everyone and I hope you guys enjoyed
