my 10 products I would repurchase tag
and I was tagged by strawberry lunch at
48 and a dubs to do this so yeah also I
want to mention that I am sick right now
so like two days ago I completely lost
my voice and I sounded like a complete
man but thankfully it's coming back so
if you guys are wondering why I'm kind
of like out of it or if I seem tired or
if my voice sounds a little bit
different that is why because I'm sick
which sucks though the meaning of this
tag is basically if you lost all of your
makeup what ten products would you
repurchase so I have a couple of face
products to start out with so I'm just
gonna get into it my first one is my
foundation that I wear every day and
this is my l'oreal true match foundation
and i'm in the shade natural buff and ii
i love this stuff so much i always talk
about it but this is literally the
perfect shade for me like this is my all
year around shade it's a little bit
tanner than my natural skin color but I
do wear like tanning lotion during the
cooler seasons so this is like what I
use all year round
it's oil-free it doesn't have any
shimmer or anything on it it's really
nice and yeah I love that stuff it's
also very inexpensive which is a plus
the next one is my Mac MSN as I am in
the shade medium plus it's a little bit
too light for me right now but I mean
it's not that bad but this is pretty
much what I wear all year round as well
my next face products that I would
repurchase is my favorite bronzer which
is the Too Faced chocolate Soleil
bronzer I'm in the shade chocolate which
is the darker one I think the lighter
one is called like milk chocolate but it
looks like this it's just a matte
bronzer it's very nice and blendable
and it smells like chocolate which you
know it's always good so definitely
recommend this stuff my next face
product would have been my Mac Sunday
afternoon face powder which looks like
this because it's like a blush and a
highlight all in one but this tag is
things that I would repurchase and some
this was in a collection can't really
repurchase that so my actual product
that I would have to say is the bomb
frat-boy blush I really really like this
blush because it's like pink and peachy
and it's really nice it's definitely
more of a summer and spring color but
you know I'm a rebel I break the rules I
wear this during fall this thing that
was really lame but no like literally
like I wear that all year-round then I
have a couple of eye products the first
one is a palette and you guys probably
all know what I'm about to show because
everyone literally talks about it
shocker
it is the Urban Decay Naked palette but
I pretty much use this every single day
I love this palette just like everyone
else does on YouTube I'm not even going
to talk about it because you guys all
are probably so sick of it but that is
my next product that I would repurchase
the next one is my favorite mascara and
this is the benefit they're real mascara
and this mascara is so nice it makes it
look like you're wearing false eyelashes
but you're really not
so there's what the brush looks like it
has like a spike on the top so love the
brush love the product it's all good my
last eye makeup products that I would
repurchase is the Urban Decay 24/7
glide-on eye pencil in demolition this
is just a dark like matte brown color
looks like that it looks very nice I
like this better than my black eyeliner
sometimes because this looks a little
bit more natural and subtle looking so I
wear this pretty much to school every
single day and also I just really really
really like these eyeliners I'll set the
black one in perversion but I decided to
add this one in here because I wear this
one more often but love those eyeliners
so much my next favorite is my eyebrow
pencil which I've been obsessed with
lately this is the benefit insta brow
pencil in the shade medium
it has a spoolie at the end which is
very convenient and then
the product on the other end and I can
give you guys a swatch if you want it's
that one right there but it's the
perfect shade it lasts all day it's very
very creamy and soft and it's just like
really good so then I only have two more
products to show you guys and they are
both lip products the first one is my
Burt's Bees Sun protecting lip balm it
has SPF 8 and actually life ganic here
on YouTube gave this chapstick to me and
I love it so much because obviously it
protects your lips from the Sun but it's
also white so it kind of tense your lips
like a lighter color and you know you
guys know how much I love my like lip
colors so this is really nice
I wear this alone all the time because
it just like gives it like a lighter
wash to your lips and it's also very
moisturizing and I love Burt's Bees and
then my second one is the MAC lipstick
in myth because I talk about this all
the time and I'd wear it pretty much
every single day and it's really it's
like enough know it's getting down there
so I'm gonna have to be purchase one
very soon it is so nice so yeah that is
it for today's video I hope you guys
enjoyed it I will see you guys for
another one very soon and yeah bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
