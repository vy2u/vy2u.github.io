my 2011 beauty favorites videos and I
just want to say I'm sorry I haven't
made a video on like a week but the good
news is I've been making tons and tons
of videos on my second channel which is
beyond beauty Star TV and that's because
I started using the iMovie app on my
phone so I've just been vlogging
basically every single day and just kind
of you know editing it quickly and just
uploading it so if you guys really like
you know flogged types of videos and
stuff like that then definitely check
that out it will be the first link in
the downbar to my second channel and
also if you don't notice my hair looks a
little bit different yesterday actually
dad by here and I tried to do the ombre
so my brown hair is kind of more down
and then also i bleached the tips of my
hair and I know it didn't really turn
out you know the best because obviously
I did this at home so I think it was
pretty good for doing it at home and
also I just quickly want to mention that
I know that the brown kind of ends
really short so it kind of looks like I
just didn't die my roots in a long time
but the reason that I didn't bring the
brown down a lot more is just because my
hair goes really really fast and this is
my natural hair color so within like a
month it's gonna go down a lot more so I
just decided that I would just kind of
you know not really go too far down
because my hair is going to end up
growing in the note be my perfect length
instead of being too long you guys know
what I'm saying so yeah kind of low and
tell me if you guys like it um you know
it's a new year so I just want to try
something new so I hope you guys can see
it and that's kind of new and exciting I
guess but other than that I'm just going
to get right into it yeah okay so the
first thing is i'm pretty sure everybody
has included this in their video so I'm
just going to do it first and just get
it over with it's the Naked palette from
urban decay yeah I'm pretty sure like
everyone talked about this but it
honestly is an amazing product you just
you can make so many makeup looks with
all these colors I'm sure you guys have
all seen this before all in all love
this palette
recommend you guys getting it haven't
tried the second one yet so I don't know
if I'm going to get it yet but i love
this to death so my next favorite is
definitely the too faced chocolate
soleil bronzer oh my goodness if you
haven't tried this you need to go and
buy it I'm not even kidding this is my
favorite bronzer that I've ever used
like my entire life and it's kind of sad
because I dropped it and it cracked all
over the place it was at school so it's
not like I could have like picked up the
pieces or anything and it was just I
want to cry it was so sad but i'm happy
that i kept the packaging so i can
include it in this video but this is the
really really old packaging but um they
updated it a little bit once I start
running out of the bronzers that i'm
currently using right now i'm definitely
going to repurchase this and i'm really
upset that it broke but whatever alright
so the next product is the benefit
browsing go go palette and if you guys
don't if some of you don't you know fill
in your eyebrows then this isn't really
helpful for you but if you do then i
definitely recommend trying it out it
looks like this and i've been using it
every single day since i got it i love
it it on it it's like waterproof
honestly like you can swim with this and
it just lasts all day so i love this
stuff to death so my next favorite would
have to be my favorite mascara and it's
the covergirl LashBlast waterproof
mascara looks like this the brush looks
like this i'm sure you guys are pretty
familiar with this mascara because it's
really popular but i just love the
consistency of this and it's super
awesome i have it in very black so it
just looks like that my next favorite
would have to be the Urban Decay
eyeshadow primer potion of course how
could I not include this in this video
definitely one of the best eyeshadow
primers that I've ever used and this is
the old packaging which I personally
like better i don't really like the new
one but that's okay whatever but um yeah
i'm sure you guys are pretty familiar
with this also um but yeah if you've
never really tried an eyeshadow primer
before definitely definitely get one
like it's it just makes such a big
difference it honestly just keeps your
eyeshadows bright and vibrant and unless
all day so definitely recommend this
timer super good and I love it so now i
have four lip products to show you guys
the first ones are just two chopsticks
and the first one is the burts bees
chapstick any burt's bees chapstick is
just really my favorite I love words
because it's one of my favorite brands
and this is the Sun protecting one and
it's kind of white and I like that
because it kind of tints my lips a
little bit lighter so like how my lips
look with this chapstick and obviously
its Sun protecting so that's always good
and then the other one is from Nivea
nevaeh I I don't know how to say it I
really don't but um I love this one I
use it before i go to sleep it's just
it's very thick it's just a white
chapstick and it is so moisturizing you
put it on so i'm just in love with this
and the other two lip products that i
have our two lipsticks so the first one
is the elf mineral lipstick in natural
nymph of course i had to break it so i
actually put it into like a different
container so you can't really see
anything in there but it is just a pale
pink nude lipstick well that's how it
shows off on my lips and it is so pretty
this is just kind of that perfect
everyday new lip color so I love that
super inexpensive as well and then the
other lipstick that I've been loving is
the Revlon lustrous lipstick in Primrose
so when you open it up it looks like
this it looks like it'd be like a really
bright Barbie pink color but I'm
actually wearing it on my lips right now
and it's just a very kind of it's like
kind of bold but not really i don't
really know how to explain it but it's
just it's such a pretty and flattering
color it's kind of cooler total pink and
i like cool tone colors a lot more than
warmer so it just looks like that then i
have three brushes to show you guys the
first one is the Sigma SS 187 brush it's
just you know your average stippling
brush I use this every single day for
foundation and it makes my face look
flawless so I've just been using this
every single day
since I got it and then the other two
are my bronzer brushes that's what i
call them because i use these both for
bronzers and contouring and stuff like
that so this one is from bhcosmetics
it's just kind of like a little small
dome brush I don't really know how to
describe it but I use this for like my
temples and contouring and stuff like
that and then also I have the elf powder
brush which looks like this I love it
because it's like a flat top brush and I
use this to kind of buff out my bronzer
and kind of blend it in so these are the
two that i use for bronzer and i just i
love it so then i have one blush and it
is the covergirl and Olay simply ageless
sculpting blush and this is in plush
peach I actually found out about this
because lauren conrad made a like blog
about it once and it looks like this my
looks really dirty and nasty but it is
seriously it's so pretty so that's how
it looks right there you can see it it's
underneath the the pink lipstick but
it's super blendable you can make it
look really bold and bright and have
peachy like you know cheeks but then
again you can also really blend it out
and make it look more natural on stuff
and it also comes with a little circle
sponge right here but I've never used it
just because I like to use my fingers
with it but yes i love that blush so the
next product is a facial product and it
is the Burt's Bees natural acne
solutions looks like this it's my
everyday facial cleanser that I use I'm
running out but I don't really talk
about a lot because I don't really talk
about skin care alot and I don't know
but I just I really love this line I
love their spot treatment super super
good i also just love this so I've just
been using this every single day since I
got it and i've been using it for a long
long time and i think it works very well
because i don't really get a lot of acne
and it's because of this so the next
product is the macadamia natural oil
deep repair masque my hair would be
nowhere without this you guys know that
i don't know i hear a lot so it really
does need that moisture and this
does it for that so I love this so much
well worth of money kind of pricey but
that's okay I'm totally fine with paying
for it because I love this stuff so much
and I also have another hair product and
it's actually a tool and this is the
cake you see professional ceramic X heat
flatiron I probably curl my hair with
this more than I straightened my hair
but I actually kind of straighten my
hair today like really really quickly I
love this so much it heats up super fast
and it's super good quality so I
definitely know that I'm going to be
using this for years and years so the
last product that i want to show you
guys is the juicy couture perfume looks
like this i wear all the time especially
this year i've been wearing it a bunch
and I just get so many compliments on
this which is which is you know great
you know it's nice to be known first
mind good so I love this stuff so much
and I think it's just called Juicy
Couture I'm not really sure it's not
doesn't really have like a different
title like kind of like people like
juicy it just it's just Juicy Couture so
maybe it's just like the original one I
don't really know but that concludes my
2011 beauty favorites video so I hope
you guys enjoyed it um you know
countable tell me what you guys think
about my hair be nice okay I did it
myself and it was kind of hard okay and
I will see you guys for a new video
hopefully soon and that's it okay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
