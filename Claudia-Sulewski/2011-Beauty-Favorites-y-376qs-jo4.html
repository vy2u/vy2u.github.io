my 2011 beauty favorites videos and I
just want to say I'm sorry I haven't
made a video on like a week but the good
news is I've been making tons and tons
of videos on my second channel which is
beyond beauty start TV and that's
because I started using the iMovie app
on my phone so I've just been vlogging
basically every single day and just kind
of you know editing it quickly and just
uploading it so if you guys really like
you know vlog types of videos and stuff
like that then definitely check that out
it will be the first link in the downbar
to my second channel and also if you
don't notice my hair looks a little bit
different yesterday actually dyed my
hair and I tried to do the ombre so my
brown hair is kind of more down and then
also I bleached the tips of my hair and
I know it didn't really turn out you
know the best because obviously I did
this at home so I think it was pretty
good for doing it at home and also I
just quickly want to mention that I know
that the brown kind of ends really short
so it kind of looks like I just didn't
dye my roots in a long time but the
reason that I didn't bring the brown
down a lot more it's just because my
hair goes really really fast and this is
my natural hair color so within like a
month it's gonna go down a lot more so I
just decided that I would just kind of
you know not really go too far down
because my hair is gonna end up growing
and then oh you have perfect length
instead of being too long you guys know
what I'm saying so yeah comment below
and tell me if you guys like it you know
it's a new year so I just wants to try
something new so I hope you guys can see
it and that's kind of new and exciting I
guess but other than that I'm just going
to get right into it yeah okay so the
first thing is I'm pretty sure everybody
has included this in their video so I'm
just gonna do it first and just get it
over with
it's The Naked palette from Urban Decay
yeah I'm pretty sure like everyone
talked about this but it honestly is an
amazing product you just you can make so
many makeup looks with all these colors
I'm sure you guys have all seen this
before
oh and I love this palette
recommend you guys getting it haven't
tried the second one yet
so I don't know if I'm gonna get it yeah
but I love this to death so my next
favorite is definitely the Too Faced
chocolate Soleil bronzer oh my goodness
if you haven't tried this you need to go
and buy it I'm not even kidding this is
my favorite bronzer that I've ever used
like my entire life and it's kind of sad
because I dropped it and it cracked all
over the place and it was at school so
it's not like I kind of like picked up
the pieces or anything and it was just I
want to cry it was so sad but I'm happy
that I kept the packaging so I can
include it in this video but this is the
really really old packaging but um they
updated it a little bit once I start
running out of the bronzers that I'm
currently using right now I'm definitely
going to repurchase this and I'm really
upset that it broke but whatever alright
so the next product is the benefit
browse and gogo palette and if you guys
don't if some of you don't you know fill
in your eyebrows then this isn't really
helpful for you but if you do then I
definitely recommend trying it out it
looks like this and I've been using it
every single day since I got it I love
it and on it it's like waterproof
honestly like you can swim with this and
it just lasts all day so I love this
stuff to death so my next favorite would
have to be my favorite mascara and it's
the covergirl LashBlast waterproof
mascara looks like this the brush looks
like this I'm sure you guys are pretty
familiar with this mascara because it's
really popular but I just love the
consistency of this and it's super
awesome I have it in very black so it
just looks like that
my next favorite would have to be the
Urban Decay eyeshadow primer potion of
course how could I not include this in
this video definitely one of the best
eyeshadow primers that I've ever used
and this is the old packaging which I
personally like better I don't really
like the new one but that's okay
whatever but um yeah I'm sure you guys
are pretty familiar with this also but
yeah if you've never really tried an
eyeshadow primer before definitely
definitely get one like it it just makes
such a big difference it honestly just
keeps your eyeshadows bright and vibrant
and it
all day so definitely recommend this
primer super good and I love it so now I
have four lip products to show you guys
the first ones are just to trap sticks
and the first one is the Burt's Bees
chapstick any Burt's Bees chapstick it's
just really my favorite I love words
because it's one of my favorite brands
and this is the Sun protecting one and
it's kind of white and I like that
because it kind of tints my lips a
little bit lighter so like how my lips
look with this chapstick and obviously
it's sun protecting so that's always
good and then the other one is from
Nivea Nevaeh
I don't know how to say it I really
don't but um I love this one I use it
before I go to sleep it's just it's very
thick it's just a white chapstick and it
is so moisturizing when you put it on so
I'm just in love with this and it's the
other two lip products that I have our
two lipsticks so the first one is the
elf mineral lipstick in natural nymph of
course I had to break it so I actually
put it into like a different container
so you can't really see anything in
there but it is just a pale pink nude
lipstick well that's how it shows off on
my lips and it is so pretty this is just
kind of that perfect everyday nude lip
color so I love that super inexpensive
as well and then the other lipstick that
I've been loving is the Revlon lustrous
lipstick in Primrose so when you open it
up it looks like this it looks like it'd
be like a really bright Barbie pink
color but I'm actually wearing it on my
lips right now and it's just a very kind
of it's like kind of bold but not really
I don't really know how to explain it
but it's just it's such a pretty and
flattering color it's kind of a cooler
tone pink and I let cool till colors a
lot more than warmer so it just looks
like that then I have three brushes to
show you guys the first one is the Sigma
SS 187 brush it's just you know your
average stippling brush I use this every
single day for foundation and it makes
my face look flawless
so I've just been using this obviously
all day since I got it and then the
other two are my bronze art brushes
that's what I call them because I use
these both for bronzers and contouring
and stuff like that so this one is from
BH Cosmetics it's just kind of like a
little small dome brush I don't really
know how to describe it but I use this
for like my temples and contouring and
stuff like that and then also I have the
ELF powder brush which looks like this I
love it because it's like a flat top
brush and I use this to kind of buff out
my bronzer and kind of blend it in so
these are the two that I use for bronzer
and I just I love it so that I have one
blush and it is the covergirl and Olay
simply ageless sculpting blush and this
is a plush peach I actually found out
about this because Lauren Conrad made a
life blog about it once and it looks
like this my looks really dirty and
nasty but it is seriously it's so pretty
so that's how it looks right there you
can see it it's underneath the pink
lipstick but it's super blendable you
can make it look really bold and bright
and have peachy like you know cheeks but
then again you can also really blend it
out and make it look more natural and
stuff and it also comes with a little
circle sponge right here but I've never
used it just because I like to use my
fingers with it but yes I love that
blush so the next product is a facial
product and it is the Burt's Bees
natural acne solutions looks like this
it's my everyday facial cleanser that I
use I'm running out but I don't really
talk about a lot because I don't really
talk about skincare a lot and I don't
know but I just I really love this line
I love their spa treatment it's super
super good I also just love this so I've
just been using this every single day
since I got it and I've been using it
for a long long time and I think it
works very well because I don't really
get a lot of acne and it's because of
this so the next product is the
macadamia natural oil deep repair mask
my hair would be nowhere without this
you guys know that I don't know I hear a
lot so it really does need that moisture
and this
does it for that so I love this so much
well worth of money kind of pricey but
that's okay I'm totally fine with paying
for it because I love this stuff so much
and I also have another hair product and
it's actually a tool and this is the kqc
professional ceramic X heat flatiron
I probably curl my hair with this more
than I straightened my hair but I
actually kind of straightened my hair
today like really really quickly I love
this so much it heats up super fast and
it's super good quality so I definitely
know that I'm gonna be using this for
years and years so the last product that
I want to show you guys is the Juicy
Couture perfume looks like this I wear
it all the time especially this year
I've been wearing it a bunch and I just
get so many compliments on this which is
which is you know great you know it's
nice to be known first mind good so I
love this stuff so much and I think it's
just called Juicy Couture I'm not really
sure it's not it doesn't really have
like a different title like kinda like
people like juicy it just it's just
Juicy Couture so maybe it's just like
the original one I don't really know but
that concludes my 2011 beauty favorites
video so I hope you guys enjoyed it
you know accountable tell me what you
guys think about my hair be nice okay I
did it myself and it was kind of hard
okay and I will see you guys for a new
video hopefully soon and that's it okay
