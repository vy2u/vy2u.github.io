to make a video today and I didn't know
what video to do so I was like ah and I
realized that a lot of girls have
entrusted me to do the 25 questions tag
and I thought this one was really fun
because you guys can sort of get to know
me a lot better from this tag because
there are like a lot of brand questions
in this one um so yeah that's all I have
to say and I don't think I'm going to be
able to make a video tomorrow I'm sorry
about that but let's just get right into
it so number one do you have any pets

dog and he was Yorkie but now I just
have three goldfish and they don't
really have any like names because we
kind of switch them off like all the
time so whatever so number two name
three things that are physically close
to you um all right so my iPod let's
plug into my laptop and then my laptop

don't know but I woke up really late
today
number six was the last time you
showered last night number seven was
last movie you saw I watched with my
friends for skunk two nights ago and
that maybe is really good and it's
really long number eight what does your
last text message say all right well I
have a lot of Facebook messages because
I Facebook sent to my phone but I'm not
going to count that as text messages so
my last text message was hey what's up
from this dude named Nico and he says
hey what's up like 10 times a day
oh and then also number nine is what's
your ringtone I'm gonna show you guys
it's been this ringtone for exactly a
year because this is like one year old
this phone and I never changed it and
this is it
that's it
so yeah I have that like synced into my
brain because I hear all the time every
day
number 10 what Oh have you been to a
different country no only America number

it's so gross so I have to like swallow
the like pills and stuff number 14 how
many siblings do you have
I have two older brothers when Anne is
16 one is his 20s one lives here one
doesn't so yeah number 15 side this is
like far away so I'm like I'm trying to
find like where the last question is
okay number 15 do you have a desktop
computer or a laptop laptop it has a
little sticker on it and this is like
the old like MacBook another looking
MacBook Pro now and that came out like a
month after I bought this one and I was
so mad but whatever

contacts or glasses no I do not but I do
like wearing colored contacts for fun
they're really fun I don't know it's
cool having like a different color yes
um number 18 you color your hair okay
this is like basically my natural hair
color and some videos my hair looks like
some of you guys are like Claude did you
get highlights but now last summer I got
like caramel highlights and I don't know
some of them are still like in my hair
but I think I'm going to get them
because they looked really cool so yeah
I think I'm going to get highlights
again but otherwise I don't do anything
to my hair number 19 tell me something
you are planning to do today I have no
idea what I'm going to be doing today
I know I'm going to sleep over at my
friend Haley's house because tomorrow
I'm going to be going with her somewhere
and we have to wake up early rather than
that I'm probably just gonna like call
up some friends and we're gonna end up
like Hank it out somewhere I have no
idea I'm number 20 when was the last
time you cried
okay so I'm one of those people like if
you if you knew me like a person you
would know that if I ever cry in front
of you then that means something serious
happened because I just I don't know why
but I'm like one of those people that
it's like I cannot cry in front of
anyone like I've cried too I've cried in
front of like one of my best friends
like I'll cry there's like one person
with me but there's a group of people
like my body just doesn't let me cry
it's like it's weird like I think the
last time I cried I like teared up but
like full-on crying let go um um the
last time I like full-on cried was like
legitly like a year ago or something I I
don't cry that bad I like tear up like
little little you know teardrops like in
movies or whatever but other than that
like I don't really cry so I'm just
happy person number 21 what is your
perfect pizza topping just pepperoni I
don't go too crazy with pizzas number 22
which do you prefer hamburgers or
cheeseburgers
I prefer hamburgers because I like
cheeseburgers but my hamburger I would
put ketchup lettuce and tomato 23 have
you ever had an all-nighter of course I
have
time especially like you know with
sleepovers and stuff and sometimes even
YouTube makes me have like an
all-nighter but never during the school
year because that's not smart
number 24 what is your eye color it's
like a dark green but then I have like a
Sun which means you'd have like yellow
close to the pupil and then I don't know
they're just like I guess their overall
green I used to think they were like
hazel or something I have no idea and
the last question 25 can you taste the
difference between Pepsi and Coke no um
I actually haven't had Pepsi and Coke in
like a really long time because I'm
gonna try not to drink pop at all
wildlife braces for two years I'm going
to see if I can go for that because pop
is like really bad for you and I just
haven't had Pepsi and Coke in like a
couple months now no like two months or
whatever but um yeah definitely cannot
say taste a difference at all but I'd
also do again but I just can't alright
so that is it for today's video
sorry I keep making like a bunch of
these tags but comment below for any
requests on videos that you guys want me
to do except for room tour house tour
and makeup collection because I know I
have to do this but right now my room is
so messy like you guys do not want to
see my floor like you can't even see it
I'm happy that like my bed is at least
clean but um yeah and also house tour
not yet and then make a book should not
yet so I'm kind of low for videos other
than those because I am running out
ideas here so that is it for today's
video
and I'll probably see you guys in two
days because I don't think I'm going to
be making a video tomorrow
alright Lottie ways I'm like dragging
this on and on and on so yeah bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
