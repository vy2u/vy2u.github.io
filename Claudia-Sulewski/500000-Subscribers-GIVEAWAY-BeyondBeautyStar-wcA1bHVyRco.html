as many of you guys know I've recently
hit half a million subscribers I just
quickly wanted to thank you guys because
it is just it's so unreal I just feel
like there's nothing I could say that
would truly express how happy you guys
make me feel and just how thankful I am
to have all you guys and I hate getting
this cheesy because I just watching
these types of videos make me cringe so
I'm just going to keep it very sweet and
simple and say that YouTube was
definitely one hundred percent the best
decision i made my entire life I don't
regret it at all I never have and it's
just I can't explain how much I love you
guys and like just how much happiness
this brings me and I just love making
YouTube videos for you guys so much I
literally could not picture my life
without YouTube at all I just all the
friends I made and just everywhere I've
gone and all the things I've done it's
just incredible so I want to thank you
guys so much because without you guys
watching my videos and supporting me
through all this like I would just be
doing homework right now I don't really
know but instead I'm filming this for
you guys so yes I just want to give you
guys a big thank you um it's I have no
words um I'm just I'm gonna stop talking
now so let's get on with the fun part of
today's video I've been it so excited to
film this I'm going to be doing a 500k
subscriber giveaway for you guys I've
noticed that I've never really done a
giveaway where I by the price of myself
and send them to you guys I've always
done giveaways that were either like
working with companies or collaborating
with different brands and stuff so I
really wanted to kind of make this
giveaway more personal so I did purchase
all of these gifts with my own money and
I bought things that I truly would love
to receive and I feel like I know you
guys pretty well so
I think you guys will be very excited
for the prizes that I'm going to be
showing you guys since the comments
section on YouTube has been kind of
weird lately and I feel like not as many
people can comment I don't know it's
just the whole google+ thing whatever I
decided to do something a little bit
different for this giveaway all you have
to do to enter into this giveaway is you
have to click on the link it will be the
first link in the description which will
bring you to one of my tweets and all
you have to do is just retweet that
tweet and you'll automatically be
entered into the giveaway by doing this
I thought it's going to be very easy and
fair for you guys because you can only
retweet once so everybody gets a fair
chance and only like one submission or
whatever basically you guys are going to
have 10 days to retweet my tweet and
then on November 30th I'm going to go
through the list of the people that have
retweeted that specific tweet and i'm
just going to tweet out their usernames
and say you are winner number 1 i'm
going to DM you and ask what prize you
want either one two or three and then
once the first winner gets back to me
and then i will save that price for them
then i'll make another tweet this person
is my second winner so they'll choose
want to send me their address and then
so forth with the last winter so I just
thought this method would be very
organized and simple not like having
thousands of comments of people just
repeating the same thing and getting
spammed and all of that so that is all
you have to do just click on that first
link in the description and retweet it
so now onto the rules for the giveaway
since I'm trying to keep this giveaway
as simple as possible I only have three
rules that you guys have to follow
before entering so first off you have to
be subscribed to my youtube channel
because obviously this giveaway is for
you guys my subscribers the ones who you
know watch my videos and support me and
stuff so you have to be subscribed to my
youtube channel you also have to thumbs
up this video and like it and the last
rule is you have to follow me on twitter
and
I think that's kind of a given because
if i have to DM you for your interest
then we have to follow each other to be
able to DM each other so that's kind of
like a given right there but yeah that
is all you have to do so it's just very
simple and straightforward subscribe to
my channel like this video follow me on
twitter and click on that link right
there and hit retweet and that is it on
November 30th at seven o'clock central
time I will be announcing my first
winner waiting for their response and
then I'm going to announce the other
winners so it's all gonna be on Twitter
also I didn't want to mention that
tweeting me to choose you for the
giveaway is not going to help your
chances at all um so you don't have to
like tweet me a bunch and say like
please pick me because on the 30th I'm
literally just going to go to who
retweeted my tweet and just scroll
through and randomly choose three people
so I'm not even going to be looking at
the tweets that you guys send me boiling
away it's all just going to be who
retweeted that so they're going to be
three winners there's two good prizes
and then one kind of smaller I don't
know I thought three was a pretty good
number so first we're going to start off
with prize number one the first item in
price number one is a white 16 gigabyte
ipad mini so this is the first thing
that you'll be receiving it when I first
tweeted about the giveaway a bunch of
you guys tweeted about the ipad mini so
I'm really excited to be giving this
away so that's the first thing that
comes in prize number one the next thing
you'll be receiving is the lorac Pro
palette and I personally have always
wanted to try this out but I don't even
own one so I'll like throw in a photo of
what the eyeshadows look like but I've
heard so many good things about this
palette and I personally have always
wanted it for a very long time but I
thought this would be a really nice gift
so this is the second thing you'll be
receiving next up you'll be getting a
bath and Bodyworks candle in one of
their mason jars and this is the merry
cookie scent which smells so good it
smells exactly like sugar cookies you

now on to prise number two the first and
main item that will be in this prize is
ha I'm Mike by Marc Jacobs bag oh so
excited to show this to you guys you'll

think it's like the classic q something
something it's the smaller size but I
have this exact bag in the root beer
Shay which is more of like a brown one
and I loved it so much I use it all the
time because it's just so functional and
it has so many pockets in it so over
here you've got like a big pocket that
goes all the way down to the bottom of
the bag and you've got like a zipper
pocket inside so it's just a really nice
everyday like little satchel and I
decided to go with black because i
figured that most of you guys like a
black bag just because it matches with a
lot of things I got it from nordstrom
