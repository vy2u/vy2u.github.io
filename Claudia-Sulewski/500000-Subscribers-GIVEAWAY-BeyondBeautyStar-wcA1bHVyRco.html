video as many of you guys know I
recently hit half a million subscribers
I just quickly wanted to thank you guys
because it is just it's so unreal I just
feel like there's nothing I could say
that would truly express how happy you
guys make me feel and just how thankful
I am to have all you guys and I hate
getting this cheesy because I just
watching these types of videos make me
cringe so I'm just gonna keep it very
sweet and simple and say that YouTube
was definitely 100% the best decision I
made my entire life I don't regret it at
all I never have and it's just I can't
explain how much I love you guys and
like just how much happiness this brings
me and I just love making youtube videos
for you guys so much I literally could
not picture my life without YouTube at
all I just all the friends I made and
just everywhere I've gone and all the
things I've done it's just incredible so
I wanted to thank you guys so much
because without you guys watching my
videos and supporting me through all
this
like I would just be doing homework
right now I don't really know but
instead I'm filming this for you guys so
yes I just want to give you guys a big
THANK YOU it's I have no words I'm just
I'm gonna stop talking now so let's get
on with the fun part of today's video
I've been it so excited to film this I'm
going to be doing a 500k subscribers
giveaway for you guys I've noticed that
I've never really done a giveaway where
I buy the price myself and send them to
you guys I've always done giveaways that
were either like working with companies
or collaborating with different brands
and stuff so I really wanted to kind of
make this giveaway more personal so I
did purchase all of these gifts with my
own money and I bought things that I
truly would love to receive and I feel
like I know you guys pretty well so
I think you guys will be very excited
for the prizes that I'm gonna be showing
you guys since the comments section on
YouTube has been kind of weird lately
and I feel like not as many people can
comment I don't know it's just the whole
Google+ thing whatever I decided to do
something a little bit different for
this giveaway all you have to do to
enter into this giveaway is you have to
click on the link it will be the first
link in the description which will bring
you to one of my tweets and all you have
to do is just retweet that tweet and
you'll automatically be entered into the
giveaway by doing this I thought it's
gonna be very easy and fair for you guys
because you can only retweet once so
everybody gets a fair chance and only
like one submission or whatever
basically you guys are going to have 10
days to retweet my tweet and then on
November 30th I'm going to go through
the list of the people that have
retweeted that specific tweet and I'm
just going to tweet out their usernames
and say you are winner number one I'm
going to DM you and ask what prize you
want either 1 2 or 3 and then once the
first winner gets back to me and then I
will save that price for them they'll
make another tweet this person is my
second winner so they'll choose one send
me their address and then so forth with
the last winner so I just thought this
method would be very organized and
simple not like having thousands of
comments of people just repeating the
same thing and getting spammed and all
of that so that is all you have to do
just click on that first link in the
description and retweet it so now on to
the rules for the giveaway since I'm
trying to keep this giveaway as simple
as possible I only have three rules that
you guys have to follow before entering
so first off you have to be subscribed
to my youtube channel because obviously
this giveaway is for you guys my
subscribers the ones who you know watch
my videos and support me and stuff so
you have to be subscribed to my youtube
channel you also have to thumbs up this
video and like it and the last rule is
you have to follow me on Twitter
I think that's kind of a given because
if I have to DM you for your address
then we have to follow each other to be
able to DM each other so that's kind of
like a given right there but yeah that
is all you have to do so it's just very
simple and straightforward subscribe to
my channel like this video follow me on
Twitter and click on that link right
there and hit retweet and that is it on
November 30th at 7 o'clock Central Time
I will be announcing my first winner
waiting for their response and then I'm
going to announce the other winners so
it's all gonna be on Twitter also I
didn't want to mention that tweeting me
to choose you for the giveaway is not
going to help your chances at all so you
don't have to like tweet me a bunch and
say like please pick me because on the
30th I'm literally just gonna go to who
retweeted my tweet and just scroll
through and randomly choose three people
so I'm not even going to be looking at
the tweets that you guys send me for the
good way it's all just gonna be who
retweeted that so they're going to be 3
winners there's two good prizes and then
one kind of smaller I don't know I
thought 3 was a pretty good number so
first we're gonna start off with prize
number 1 the first item in prize number
one is a white 16-gigabyte
I pad mini so this is the first thing
that you'll be receiving it when I first
tweeted about the giveaway a bunch of
you guys tweeted about the iPad Mini so
I'm really excited to be giving this
away so that's the first thing that
comes in prize number 1 the next thing
you'll be receiving is the lorac Pro
palette and I personally have always
wanted to try this out but I don't even
own one so I like thrown a photo of what
the eyeshadows look like but I've heard
so many good things about this palette
and I personally have always wanted it
for a very long time but I thought this
would be a really nice gift so this is
the second thing you'll be receiving
next up you'll be getting a bath &amp;amp;
Bodyworks candle in one of their mason
jars and this is the merry cookie scent
which smells so good it smells exactly
like sugar cookies you'll also be

and these are really good I have to make
one so that will be in there also you'll

okay so now on to prize number two the
first and main item that will be in this
prize is ha a mic by Marc Jacobs bag I
was so excited to show this to you guys
you'll be receiving this purse and I
still have no idea what the style name
of it is I think it's like the classic
queue something something it's the
smaller size but I have this exact bag
in the root bear Shay which is more of
like a brown one and I love it so much I
use it all the time because it's just so
functional and it has so many pockets in
it so over here you've got like a big
pocket that goes all the way down to the
bottom of the bag and you've got like a
zipper pocket inside so it's just a
really nice everyday like little satchel
and I decided to go with black because I
figured that most of you guys are like a
black bag just because it matches with a
lot of things I got it from Nordstrom
it's brand new it's not
used or anything literally bought it
today so I'll have this all like correct
nice and pretty
