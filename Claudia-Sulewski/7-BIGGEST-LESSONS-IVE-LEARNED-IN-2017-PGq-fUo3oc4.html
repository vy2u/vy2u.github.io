channel for today's video it's just
gonna be a simple sit-down talking video
but I'm excited about these because
these are all just things that I've
personally been going through and feel
very passionate about and so I'm gonna
go through a 7 lessons that I've learned
in 2017 just a disclaimer these are
obviously lessons that I've just been
going through and kind of learning along
the way but I feel like they're all
pretty general and a lot of you guys can
relate to them and so yeah I'm gonna try
to like keep it vague so that it kind of
can tie in with what everyone's going
through so I wrote them down a sheet of
paper so that I knew exactly what I was
talking about so the first one that I
really really learned this year and
honestly I feel like this is kind of the
most recent one too that I'm actually
going through right now it's okay to say
no and in many cases it's the right
choice and by this I'm not talking about
like saying no to drugs
saying no to like cooking up with like
those I mean obviously 1000%
I'm kind of referring to the smaller
moments kind of more focusing on saying
no to the things that will like bring
you stress or you know don't really
benefit you in like a like mental
physical way and so I guess getting into
that basically I have always been a
pretty big people pleaser as far as
hanging out with people the second they
asked me to do it or you know making a
promise and keeping up with it and just
piling so much on my plate and I think
this year I really learned that
sometimes it's so okay to say no and
especially when you're focusing on other
things and I think you know for me work
has been like a huge priority and it's
taking up so much of my time and
sometimes as simple is just saying like
no I'm so sorry like I I have to focus
on other things or I'm working on
something I'm busy whatever and it seems
so much more dramatic in your head and
you think they're gonna be offended but
like it's so fine it is so so okay to
say no I have another lesson that kind
of like falls into this but we'll touch
on that later and it's kind of about
like not being able to always hang out
and that's where stuff but we'll get
into that later but yeah anyways learn
how to say no and it's totally fine
be okay with it the next one is taking
care of yourself is everything this is
also something that
I've recently kind of been going through
I kind of I talked about this in one of
my vlogs I'll have a link down below but
I kind of reached the point where I was
spreading myself so thin with so many
different things that I was doing and
making sure that I'm keeping up with my
friendships and my work and this and
that and I reached a point where I
realized that I just wasn't spending any
time for myself as simple as like
sitting down and watching a movie or
just like taking a bath or literally
anything just to do by yourself for
yourself and shut your mind off and I
think being a mentally healthy and
physically healthy is so important I
think it just raises every aspect of
your life and makes it better you feel
more confident you feel more awake you
feel present you feel ready and I find
that when you just over whelmed yourself
and overexert yourself with so much
you're not 100% and everything you do
whether it's like a conversation with
someone or some sort of work that you
have to do when you're over exerting
yourself whatever you're currently doing
in the moment you're not gonna 100% be
there and so I think you need that down
time to kind of let yourself recharge
the way that I was explaining it was
like driving a car with no gas like you
got it you got to go to those gas
stations you got to fuel up and get that
energy and then and then go there's a
cheesy cheesy a metaphor for you guys
the next lesson that I learned in 2017
has to do with keeping your environment
clean and so I wrote a clean home is a
happy home and inspiring home a
motivating home and inviting home a
healthy home I seriously think like
having a clean surrounding is seriously
like the answer to so many life problems
even just as simple as making your bed
when you wake up in the morning it it
changes your entire day I can't even
explain it it's just like I feel like it
just like psychologically mentally just
does something to your brain that's like
okay if you're done resting it's time to
start the day it's like I also like a
reward feeling too because like you you
finish that one thing and you're like
you know what's next I've always been
like a very like keeping my room clean
and all that stuff but I guess moving
out
to my own place and having to upkeep
like a kitchen and living room and
everything yeah I just find my best days
or the days that I wake up and I don't
have to worry about where something is
or if it's cluttered and and yeah and
also I mentioned it's an inviting home
and I love having people over and being
able to just make memories here and not
have to stress about like oh there's
stuff everywhere
so yeah clean home really really really
great point the next lesson that I
learned in 2017 and actually this is
something that I've always kind of kept
up with but I'm always constantly having
to remind myself this and I just always
I'm like relearning it but consistency
is everything this applies to every
single aspect of life obviously like
working out eating healthy that's
everything but even consistency with
like making promises and like being a
good friend and building any sort of
habit like if you want to start freaking
a drinking lemon water every single
morning because it's great for your
metabolism then like the way you do that
is through consistency and yeah it goes
with work and school and I just think
nowadays so many people have like short
attention spans or they want things but
they're not willing to like work for it
and ultimately it's all the things that
the little things that you're doing
every single day leading up to that and
so I mean literally it's just like
consistency I want this word and me on
right here flashing on the screen it's
everything this next lesson is the one
that I said I was gonna bring up about
like saying no I wrote missing a party
stayin in having hashtag FOMO is not the
end of the world that is a huge thing
that I learned this year I think
honestly especially moving out to before
this I lived in a house with like three
other people and so I would constantly
be around friends and I felt like I was
able to socialize while still being at
home and now moving alone and living
alone for the first time in my life I
really am in control of what I'm
spending my time doing who I'm spending
it with sometimes I don't really make
the best decisions as far as like making
sure that I'm kind of hitting each mark
but if there's something that you
and you want to go after that it is so
okay to not go to like somewhere in a
party or go out and get drinks or
whatever like it's you have to be able
to make those little sacrifices to
ultimately you know get to where you
want to be and so if you have to stand
you got to work or like if I have like
an audition that I need a freaking
memorize the next morning like there's
no chance that I'm gonna go like out to
a party or hang out friends oh my gosh
actually there's a quote that I wanted
to read to you guys that has to do with
this specific topic so let me go through
and just find it
entrepreneurship is living a few years
of your life like most people won't so
that you can spend the rest of your life
like most people can't the next one I'm
excited about this one because this one
I definitely definitely learned this
year I mean I've learned all these like
intensely this year basically I wrote
down shut up and listen I think that
everyone you meet and come across is the
superior to you in some way there's
something they know that you don't know
this feels relative to me because in the
city of Los Angeles I just like so many
people are always like oh well I've got
this going on and I'm doing this and
then this and and a lot of people just
without even really realizing it just
talk so much about what they're doing
and what they're about and about
themselves and ultimately like if you're
just like having conversation to people
about yourself you're not learning
anything you're literally just left
broken record who's just repeating like
let your work show for itself okay you
need to talk about it anyone you come
across whether it's at a grocery store
or you meet someone at a bar or a party
or you're hanging out whatever grout
work think just asking questions and
just just hearing about you know what
others know and have gone through and
stuff like you can learn the most random
facts like you could learn some random
facts about like anteaters and now you
know it you know what I mean like it can
literally be that simple maybe you meet
someone that's obsessed with animal
documentaries and bam you know or I mean
that's like a very small example I think
it's a great way especially coming from
someone who never went to college and I
mean as far as right now
I'm spending a lot of time I work and
stuff and so I don't see that at least
in the near future I kind of feel like I
missed a lot of opportunity to just
fulfill my like want for more knowledge
just like random stuff that I don't
really ever get to talk about or like
experience through my personal like life
path of what I do and spend my days
doing I think a really great way of
gaining knowledge and just kind of
fulfilling that is just getting to know
people and hearing what they've gone
through what they're doing so I like
that one and the seventh in the seventh
lesson also I feel so so passionate
about this one it's actually it's more
of like a reminder but it's it's I wrote
down remind and reflect this summer I
got super into the five minute journal
where is that so I've definitely talked
about this in vlogs basically it's just
like this little journal template that
every sing it's all empty and it has the
same kind of layout and every single
morning it gives you a quote and you
write three things are grateful for
three things that would make your day
great and then one daily affirmation and
it takes five minutes literally no
excuses
do it and then before you go to bed
you've got the shaded part and it says
three amazing things that happen today
and how could I have made today even
better I don't do this every single day
because sometimes when like when I'm
traveling I'll forget it at home or
whatever but I tend to pick it up and I
kind of all have phases where I'll just
do it for like four weeks in a row and
then I'll like skip for five days and
I'll do it anyway so I find that like
the days that I fill this in are the
greatest days ever I don't think you
need to go out and buy anything or like
do any sort of intense like activity
like this because this can be a little
intimidating to some people I think just
like the general practice of
construction is not what I'm grateful
for right now that's what it is right
street cleaner street cleaning I'm
grateful for that but not right now it's
fine
yeah it's just kind of like the act of
getting into the routine of just
reminding yourself what you're grateful
for the blessings in your life I think
that's the biggest thing that this did
for me was when I would
have to write three amazing things that
happened at the end of the day I started
kind of like getting into the mental
habit of picking up on those things like
the second they happen so if I have like
a really lovely encounter at the grocery
store or like something really nice
happens like I remember I'd always be
like oh my god I'm so excited to write
that into my journal but now it's just
kind of becoming a mental habit of like
wow that was like that was such a cute
little like moment this is like a really
not relatable example but it made me
really happy and I just thought of it
right now so I'm sharing it we recently
had our screening event for versus and I
basically like leading up to having to
drive there I freaking like broke my
zipper my entire outfit was like
literally ripped I had to rip it off of
my body
alexxa Losey my neighbor she was like
trying to she's my friend why did I say
neighbor cuz she lives next door so it
just really worked out anyways she was
trying to like zip it off it broke
she's like it's fine it's fine we got a
new outfit she stabs me in 30 seconds so
much better than the first look very
very grateful for Alexa but then I was
stressed out cuz I was like running late
to the screening and we had to go like
take carpet pictures whatever these
second I stepped on that carpet they
started blasting my favorite song of all
time and it's not like a popular song
it's called kick jump twist by Sylvan
Esso literally like that is like the
song that I label as like my happy song
and it started playing the second I like
step on that carpet cuz they're blasting
music and I was outside and I was like
what like it's like those little things
that you just start picking up on and I
don't know it just made me happy it's
like oh you're where you need to be
right now I feel like I'm really getting
into it with this lesson I think yeah
just just noticing they're good and
following that direction and like
anytime you can sense like good energy
from someone play off of them like I
have like the weirdest random like
little like jokes or like stories that
happen with like your grocery store like
cashier and so I think just like being
more aware of the good because there's
so much good out there you know it's all
kind of how you perceive things and how
you react to them and all of those good
things so those are kind of yeah some of
the bigger lessons that I learned in
2017 I hope you guys enjoy this video
and yeah if you like this style I do
this a lot on my vlog Channel I get
preachy and way too into it yeah I think
sometimes even if it's not like the most
revolutionary stuff it's a great
reminder just to hear it and kind of
remember that you know it's I don't know
you're all good things so yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed today's video I love
you guys and I'll see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
