so one hey listen Bay that's you've been
dating your phone all day to start off
with my face makeup I'm applying on at
my makeup for ever HD foundation dotting
that around and blending that in with my
Beauty Blender to highlight my face I'm
using my Maybelline instant age rewind
eye brightener and applying it to the
highlighting points on my face and
blending that out with the surviving
face powder I'm just setting my face
shout out to me dropping everything and
then I'm going in with my hoola bronzer
from benefit and contouring my face
now it's time for I make up I kept
things pretty simple today like I
normally do every single day and here's
a little quick trick for you guys you
can always just use bronzer to darken
the crease of your eye then after that
I'm just using some liquid eyeliner to
create a small wing and finishing off
the eyes with some mascara why'd I say
it like that
I don't know blush i'm i'm using rocket
or by benefits and applying it to my
cheekbones i'm using a classic Claudia
lip color today it is the NYX lip gloss
in Eclair I've got like four tubes of
these in my makeup collection right now
but that's it for the makeup and now on
to the hair I decided to keep it simple
and just brush it out and wear it
natural and straight
