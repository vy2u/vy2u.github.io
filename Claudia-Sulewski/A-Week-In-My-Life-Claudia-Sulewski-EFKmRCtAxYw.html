maybe get some shopping into the day we
shall see oh my god here all the dresses
that I'll be trying on the bottom of
this give it up give it a look
we've been trying on different outfits
and dresses I think this one's my
favorite so far it's for the 50s and the
cut is so cute check it out your only
camera well you can do special did you
do one of those like sliding up eight
years yeah yeah hey guys so we finished
up with the fitting and the little dance
rehearsals now I am at the new
york-style hall office and if you're
wondering what I'm wearing I'm wearing a
giant's shirt because I'm filming
something real quick for the NFL after
that I think we're gonna shop for little
yeah it's been a very busy morning
hi
wait I'm vlogging a clip right now hold
up okay sorry
fast-forward about two hours later I'm
currently hanging out with my brother
Marcin yo no so we just went out to eat
and you know we caught up and stuff you
later I always said my vlog clips oh so
here we have today's first look which is
modern the hair is you know a little
artistic I'm digging these little metal
things right now
cool it's pretty modern yeah it is it is
it's gonna be very interesting dancing
with these so we'll see we have to like
jump around and stuff for this thing
it's like a little nervous that I'm
gonna like totally beep but well you
know we'll figure it out we get there
so much freakin confetti so I am now in
costume number two this is a 90s so
we've got the frosted line lip we put in
like hair extensions this is crazy
incredible
we just finished dancing our 1930s look
it's really good workout but I think
we're just waiting a bit and then we've
got the 50s neck
actually I'm quite happy it was a little
itchy right
the eyeliner guyliner guyliner yep love
it are you in green day so here we have
the 80s look and oh my god it is so
insane
look at this crimped hair all decked out
so cool
so we just wrapped on me bed we're about
to take a group photo and they were so
fun
like hey guys
Claudius I'm gonna skate so it is my
last day in New York and I've got two
different videos that were shooting and
our studio is so awesome I could so live
in a loft like this it's so like bright
and open
all these windows so I guess our first
video we're doing is kind of like ballet
in fashion and then we also have a
dancer coming in and teaching me ballet
moves so that's going to be very fun
we just wrapped it up at the first shoot
I had lots of improv dialogue so it was
super easy and fun and now we are going
out to get some lunch actually I haven't
eaten anything today yet so I'm hungry
hey guys so I just arrived to the
airport because I finished with my shoot
sadly I was not able to film any part of
my second shoot because we're keeping it
a secret until it goes live so once it
does I'll be chewing it out and stuff
this is pretty much the end of my trip
I'm traveling home now and I'm quite
excited because I love coming home after
a fairly long trip</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
