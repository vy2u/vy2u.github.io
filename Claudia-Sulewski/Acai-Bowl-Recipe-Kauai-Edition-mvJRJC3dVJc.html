channel I'm currently in Kauai with
Hawaiian Tropic today we are going to be
visiting a local farm we're going to be
chopping up some fruit so I brew
I will be showing you guys a fun little
recipe before we get into all of that
stuff I'm going to quickly show you guys
what I like to do to get ready when I'm
on vacation or at a tropical location so
let's get into that straight away when
you put this product on your face you'll
notice it's very lightweight so it's not
going to be clogging your pores in any
way a little bit of that on your
fingertips you can wear it just alone
underneath your makeup and you're not
going to feel it you know gliding around
throughout the day
well nose I know it's always gets so
burned this is crucial right here you
guys know how much I love filling in my
eyebrows so no matter where I'm going
where I'm at I'm always just quickly
filling them in so I like to use any
brow powder product and just fill them
in no for the highlighter to add that
summer glow I love just finishing off
with some highlighter on the tops of my
cheekbones nose and chin
though so we're currently at the Aloha
therapy house but before we get started
with anything else tell who you want to
you know kind of introduce yourself what
we're doing today
yeah I'm Chelsea as born here on the
island of Kauai and Claudia and I are
going to be going to the Molalla organic
farm I've never talked to coconut but
I'm very excited I don't worry we're
going to come back here and I'm going to
fix up a little little treat for the
girl hopefully they like it and I'll
have to show you guys the process so
cool let's do this let's go
well here we got a poser mango mango
that was developed in Hawaii oh and it's
actually our best seller mmm my favorite
food so good I know this no that's
incredible yeah I feel like the smell is
more almost like this really subtle
knife set and yeah your mouth and you're
like whoa one of the most important the
new plants to come over with
Polynesians the coconut water within
them and the knees cook with them and
create coconut oil and numerous uses
from one plant we just got back from the
organic farm aka we have so much fruit
in front of us and I am personally
starving today we're making an acai bowl
you guys know how much I love smoothie
bowls acai bowls I'm going to have the
recipe in the downbar it's super simple
I like to chop up my toppings just so
that they're ready to go the second you
blend up that bowl there's really no way
to mess up and I say evil you can
totally put whatever you want on it
I like piece of broccoli but you get it
the fruits that I'm mainly going to be
focusing on coconut mango and guava and
a puree corm
all this fruit is like super fresh and
juicy if you guys hear that I'm actually
really excited about the coconut meat
and I feel like it is very appropriate
for the theme of this movie Bowl
oh my gosh you guys look at this banana
it's so view Heike fan of bananas I'm
bananas for bananas I'm going to quickly
make the acai bowl here we have our ice
ievel mixture I'm going to start off
with bananas granola is a month in my
book it adds that bit of crunch and kind
of hardiness to the meal with sprinkles
and sign up on there
coconut I like to call these the add-ons
like bee pollen what yeah that's a thing
it it totally is and it's great for you
we're going to sprinkle some of that on
there goji berries can't go wrong if you
want to drizzle on anything we've got
some almond butter which I love get
those healthy fats in some honey if you
want to make it sweeter lastly we have
guava puree oh so fancy
obviously I've got a bunch left which is
great because the girls are coming over
so I'm going to have them try out my
recipe and hopefully like it mother for
Joseph I'm about to go finish this
set up on me who wants to pay me I don't
think one I want to thank one my god
yeah kind of looks like peanut butter
yeah I don't about the whole cheer yes

Aloha therapy every morning yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
