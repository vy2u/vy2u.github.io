too seriously and really just enjoy your
feel like sometimes people try to have
to professional like if you want to
crack a joke or something you don't
definitely go for it and it's just don't
feel like you must have to
really had a show like who you are and
so like that because you're just boring
and plans because we're going to be like
okay definitely just have fun with it
that's my voice hi guys I'm tired Ashley
and probably my number one ginger price
is used Twitter blog TV facebook
isolated network because you can
definitely talk to a lot of gurus and
make a lot of friends who that that's at
least how I made all of these YouTube
friends and you also can like network
with other companies if you like think
you want to work with them
and I think it's sort of like builds
more exposure to the or YouTube channel
work on doing that with don't this week
really do not to be arty my channel name
like Archie this because it actually
doesn't work it doesn't get you like
lots of subscribers try like having
conversations
but then i'll get to know you more hey
guys i'm kayla you know my youtube and
my biggest advice for you if you guys
want to start off youtube channel is to
do videos on topics that you would want
to watch yourself that way your passion
goes into your own videos
hey guys I'm Morgan or miss beauty
forever so and my advice would just be
really to have your own personality and
to be yourself don't try and act like
any other guru or try and be then make
sure you have your own style your own
taste your own personality so you're
different and unique from everyone else
and just really have fun with it don't
try two more just make sure you're
really enjoying yourself and you're
confident and you had your own
personality and
I'm love from Luke fully loaded and my
advice for you is good I think that you
should get like just a really good set
up in your room with like natural
lighting good lighting because no one
wants to
the same time easy
see the watch for everyone
hey guys my name is Christie my channel
strawberryelectric for you and my advice
for you is definitely just be consistent
and give your all to your YouTube I mean
you don't have to like set a schedule to
upload every single like other day but
just try and make sure that you don't
just like leave for two months or
randomly post like five buddies that it
just spaced them out and like pace
yourself with your videos and when
people know that you're consistent don't
save your shampoo like Selma weekend or
if you're going on vacation you can
pre-fill videos on the weekend and edit
them and then upload them later you
don't have to upload them the day you
had like filling them so just kind of
face yourself with it and what
okay hi I'm Emily on CBS on YouTube and
my advice would be for you start to
practice some videos first alike maybe
just record like five just I can get
more comfortable with
hey guys my name is Alex or a dubs on
YouTube and my advice for you and
starting a YouTube channel would
probably be to hooking your viewers as
much as possible everyone's always
surfing the net looking for different
youtube channel so you want to have like
literally the best first like minute of
your video so people instantly get
hooked in don't be shy don't mumble or
like go on about something that doesn't
really relate to your video topic you
want to hook in your audience as much as
possible maybe have a nice control just
to get people interested continue to
watch it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
