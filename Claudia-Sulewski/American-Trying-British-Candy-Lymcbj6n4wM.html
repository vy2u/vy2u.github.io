wine
hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today's video is going to be really fun
to film if any of you don't know I just
came back from London England for
beautycon London which was so awesome
so shout out to everyone that I met in
London you guys were all so so so sweet
I did block a little bit so I will have
a vlog up very soon or maybe it's
already up but while I was in London
obviously I had to take advantage of the
fact that woman has different candies
than we do here in America so I decided
to buy a bunch and try them on camera
for you guys so I have like an entire
nightstand filled with candy how do I
choose which one I begin with we're
going to start off with the Kinder Bueno
candy it's milk and hazelnuts I'm very
excited because I love milk chocolate
and hazelnut boo fantasy they got double
packaging so it's like a wafer I'm so
happy I'm filming this basically it's
like a wafer cookie with some sort of
creamy hazelnut spread covered in
chocolate I'm gonna rabies as well this
is definitely a ten out of ten not so
good
now we're going to try something that's
not chocolaty so that we can kind of
spread it out this is called fruit
pastilles I don't know how to pronounce
that I know the flavors are but I think
this will be orange it's not that I
don't like it I just don't really care
to finish that flavor we're going to try
another one we've got red what's a lot
butter I would never buy this again but
it's pretty good so I'm going to give it
like a six out of ten that's kind of low
but I really wouldn't
the next candy I'm going to try is
called bounty and there are coconuts on
it so I'm guessing that this is going to
taste like almond joy which I low-key
I'm obsessed with almond joy let's open
this bad boy aah
I mean not as excited as home enjoy
because it is exactly what I thought it
would be and I'll enjoy that an almond
I'm gonna give this like a 7 out of 10
all righty I'm going to try the
Maynard's wine and gums
it's really squishy so I'm excited
because I love squishy things oh wow
it's a lot firmer than I thought it
would be mmm it's got like a slight
taste of apple cider vinegar in it let's
try red there's something off about this
I just it's okay I feel like this is
closest to like a gummy lifesaver but
give me lifesavers are they got a whole
nother level as far as taste goes so I'm
going to give this like a 4 out of 10 to
compensate for that I'm going to be
trying a candy that I actually believe I
know what it's going to taste like
because I've had candy from this brand
before and these are the Maltesers
teasers crunchy little Maltesers pieces
floating and creamy milk chocolate how
am I going to taste similar to like
what's inside the Whopper they're like a
crunch bar kind of oh man I'm excited
mm-hmm
I would definitely repurchase this I
would rate this a 9 out of 10 just
because I know this same brand makes
these balls that are pretty much all
this crunchy which off
and I like that more I'm taking this so
seriously and I love it next up we are
going to try some chew it's shoe mix a
random mix a fruit flavor chewy sweets
inside this is a pretty large bag so
it's dinner left me quite a bit of time
there strawberry a black currant oh I'm
excited to try that and fruit salad if
they kind of look exactly like
starbursts oh yeah I'm enjoying this
there's hard to eat this on camera
because I'm trying to a fast but it's
like really really sticky oh whoa
I just realized every single one is
packaged the same so you don't know what
you're gonna get let's try fruit salad
mmm or friends the bug actually it
tastes like tropical shampoo or like
hand soap or something I give these a 7
out of 10 because I like chewiness of
them but I definitely think that
starburst flavors are a lot better
actually I change my mind as a 5 out of
10
next up we've got crunchy gold packaging
it looks really exciting and happy its
milk chocolate with golden honeycomb
centers just get on in here
oops it's broken whoa oh my god the
inside is so cool mmm oh no no no that
was way too sweet for me I get what
they're trying to do because it doesn't
use bad but it's just really really
sweet like it kind of tastes like a
crunchy butterscotch cookies on the
inside that one is there's like a 4 out
of 10
we've got some dairy milk giant buttons
I'm pretty sure there's only going to be
chocolate in here but I just thought it
was really interesting I want to see
what the buttons look like wait I kind
of
disappointed for some reason I thought
that there's going to be white chocolate
and normal chocolate like I thought they
would look like little eggs or something
like that but they just look like little
brown fur cool I'm gonna give this an 8
out of 10 because packaging was really
misleading but it's very quality tasting
chocolate next up we've got munchies hmm
and they just have caramel on the inside
they're pretty simple but the temp
simple is good so many good things like
in 8.5 out of 10
next up we've got paintballs I have no
idea what to expect with these zing Lea
tingly set her oh so I guess the center
is going to be like fizzy maybe what
Center really isn't that fizzy we're not
as busy as I hoped it would be
but it's really good it just tastes like
the fruity Mentos going on yeah thank
you pretty good I'm going to give it
like a 9 out of 10 cool
I'm impressed with the pinball's I like
them next up we've got Aero chocolate
and I've actually tried chocolate from
his brand before if it is only milk
chocolate this one is just milk
chocolate but it has peppermint filled
bubbles inside so I'm excited to try
this I feel like I'm very bipolar when
it comes to mint and chocolate I have
phases where I love it and then if other
phases weren't like totally over it it
comes in like little breakable balls
bring the pool balls oh yeah this is
cool mmm that's so fun biting through it
because there are so many bubbles so
just smush it really quickly 9.5 at its
head love the texture because I'm
thinking I'm becoming like a candy
critter
when I'm older so let me know how I'm
doing but I feel like I really I'm
covering every single property of candy
fries Turkish Delight oh I don't like it
no no buy two out of ten
does that really smell like a taste of
fat but I really didn't enjoy it and I
would never finish it let alone buy it
again so I have only got two more pieces
left obviously you guys are probably
pretty excited because I feel like that
was like an endless amount of candy but
we're finally nearing towards the end
we've got a Yorkie bar and some random
chewy candy it's literally called
randoms okay we're gonna start off with
a chocolate I'm pretty sure they're like
different flavors of these as well but I
just got the original one I was kind of
intimidated I don't know what to choose
oh wait it's not even a candy bar it
like breaks up it's little pieces way
I'm so disappointed all that is is just
chocolate that's literally all that
there is to it the packaging made it
look like there was something really
exciting and creative but it's quite
boring and the chocolate doesn't even
taste that good either someone give it
an ADA done lastly we've got randoms
from what I can tell on the drawings it
looks like they're just random items in
here like a little train a trophy a
monkey a hat and an ice-cream cone we're
going to try all we've got a musical
note but it's pretty much tastes exactly
like a marshmallow some of these have
like white on them this one is purple
and it is a train car
that was good oh this one's chewy oh
it's like a center inside that goes out
yeah okay overall I think we did a great
job
so I'm gonna give this a dish out of ten
so that is all the candy that I bought
from one then and hopefully you guys
enjoyed watching me eat them I feel like
I really had very mixed feelings about
all that I'm some of them got like twos
and others got ten so I would say
all-in-all I probably prefer American
candy over British candy maybe I just
didn't choose the right ones but I just
tried to pick up every single one that
I've never heard of or never seen now my
stomach kind of hurts but it's all good
because it tasted really good news for
videos so before I go I quickly just
wanted to talk to you guys for a bit and
let some of you who don't know about
this now know about this I am being so
vague about this get to the point oh
yeah so few months ago I was announced
as Teen Vogue's first ever YouTube host
which has been so much fun I've been
doing so many crazy things traveling a
bunch meeting a bunch of people but this
month they actually launched season two
of Strictly ballet which is one of the
shows on our channel and second season
is taking place in Miami and I actually
got to go to New York a few weeks back
and film some content for them in
relation to the show so I just wanted to
mention them to you guys because I have
a lot of fun filming them so for
starters if you guys want to check out
the show I will have it linked down
below as well as you can just click it
right here I will have an annotation but
also I created a video on ballet
inspired fashion so outfits that we pull
together that kind of incorporate
different things about ballet dancing
I'll have that right here and then
lastly I filmed them really new
funny video basically just showing off
my awesome dance moves and all of the
ballet things I can do I'm totally
kidding it was actually very very
embarrassing and there's a lot of
slow-mo clips in it so I will have that
right here if you guys want to watch it
but that was super super funny to film
all of all this in Denver as well but in
general if you guys want to see any of
the content that I'm uploading on Team
bags channel they're all super fun so
I've actually got a little request for
you guys I want you to comment down
below and let me know what you guys want
to see me do on their channel because
pretty much the sky is the limit with
Teen Vogue's so for example we are able
to go through every single decade for
prom and you choreographed a really cool
dance and the dresses and makeup were
really awesome so pretty much anything
that you guys want to see me do we're
pretty down to do it if you want to
connect more with me I've got my Twitter
and my Instagram over to the left also I
have snapchat and it's just Claudia so
