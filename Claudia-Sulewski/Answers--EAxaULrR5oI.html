be doing the answers video I'm just
answering some of your guys's questions
and I'm really excited to do it and also
I just want to mention one quick thing
is I know that I made these type of
videos like during the summer last year
and I'm sorry if I like repeat some of
the questions because I honestly do not
remember what I answered or like yet
what I answered in those videos because
that was kind of in a while ago so even
if I did answer the same questions I'm
pretty sure that my answers are going to
be different so I'm sorry if I repeat
questions because I honestly don't like
remember at all also the way that I
chose the questions for today's video is
either number one they were highly
requested by like you know you guys
asking it a lot or just questions that I
thought were a little bit more
interesting to answer than like what's
your favorite color and stuff like that
so I kind of don't really want to make a
long intro to this because this video I
feel like it's going to be kind of long
so yeah let's just get right into it
okay so this question has been asked at
least like 500 times like I think half
of the questions that you guys asked me
were this question and snow at the
moment I did not have a boyfriend single
and ready to mingle so yeah I do not
have a boyfriend
when am I getting my braces off um I
think I'm going to be getting them off I
think I still have like a whole nother
year I don't know I'm definitely not
like close to getting them off yeah I'm
not really sure so I think I like a
whole another year which sucks because I
hate braces but they don't really bother
me I just
I kind of very sweet because it
obviously depends on like what like to
brand I'm wearing but I either wear a
women's six and a half or women's seven
so around that size
how am i I actually I've been starting
to grow a lot like taller lately but I'm
still really not that tall at all I'm
pretty short I think I'm like 5 3 or
something or maybe like five three and a
half I don't know somewhere around there
though
has any subscribers noticed you four
okay yes actually some people do notice
me like when I go shopping and stuff
like that people recognize me or some
people just like stare at me and they're
like and they're like message me like
the next day and be like I saw you um
also I think that a really cool thing is
like sometimes like my cousins are like
my friends will be like oh my god house
with this person they started talking
about you and I was like oh my god and
also one of my subscribers actually goes
to my school which I thought was really
cool she's like do you go to my school
so I think that's really cool
some people even just like it'll message
to me and they'll be like do you live
with love over here like I've seen you
walking around town and stuff like that
so I don't know I think it's really cool
yes they do um basically like everybody
everybody that I know knows that I make
videos and stuff like that so yeah my
friends do watch my videos they like
trying to keep up with them too so they
support me all the way which is really
awesome so I like it
how old was I um well I first started
wearing makeup in like seventh grade but
it wasn't really that much it was just
kind of like highlighter mascara that
kind of stuff so it wasn't like too much
in sixth grade not realized so I just
got to start in like seventh grade I
guess
I do have a Facebook for my YouTube page
and I'll leave I always leave it in the
downbar so you can just click on it I
think it's like Facebook calm so I
should be on Beauty star or something so
make sure like me on Facebook so that
answers that question
have I ever gotten a detention yes I
have and it was for the stupidest reason
it was because I was chewing gum and
class like are you kidding me
my math teacher gave me a detention for
a chewing gum in class and I was like oh
my god I'm a really stuck though like
don't you got in school cuz getting
detentions just stinks
I probably asked him to marry him
honestly I would yeah
what do people say okay um well once
people sorry Bri start here's nowhere
don't even know where got that um when
it first when people first like started
finding out stuff um it was like right
before winter break is like when like
everyone just kind of knew and everyone
was just like so weirded out by it
they're all like what is she doing like
she makes video showing girls how to
wear eyeliner like they I guess Lee just
like didn't really like understand and
stuff like that and I did get a bunch of
like crap for it basically um but I
think now people just don't really care
like it's like cuz you know it was like
I'm not gonna like I'm not gonna lie
like it was like a really easy thing to
make fun I was like it was like really
easy to like make fun of me for this you
know but it's like I don't really think
people really care anymore so um I don't
just I don't know like so just like I
don't I don't really know I don't know
what they say they're just like it
doesn't even no one really thinks about
anymore everyone just kind of like
forgot about it kind of so that's good
why don't I have an accent like my
parents um that is because I was born in
America and obviously my like main
language is English so I don't know I
just don't have an accident I mean cuz I
think like English was like my first
language so I don't really have an
accident I guess
actually when I was younger I did not
like my name I hated my name I have no
idea why like I when I was younger I
wanted my need to be Kimberly I think
it's because I watched Kim Possible and
I was like obsessed with that show um
but now I actually love my name like I'm
so like happy that my name is Claudia I
don't know why I just like cuz I don't
mean I know a lot of Claudia's but then
again it's not really that popular of
the name so and I like it
the first youtuber that our subscribed
to was probably iJustine like she was
like the first verse that I've ever seen
and I think she's hilarious and I love
her so it's probably her or Shane Dawson
one of its two
do I get allowance no I do not um my
parents are just kind of like they don't
really like think about that kind of
stuff like I do chores like I'll like
put the dishes out of the dishwasher and
stuff like that and you know just like
simple things like that like doing the
dish dishes and stuff and sometimes my
mom will give me like two dollars for
that but I do not get like a weekly
allowance it's not like I get like 20
bucks a week or anything that would be
amazing but no that's look that's like
not the way that like my family works Oh
No
when I dye my hair blonde I was actually
thinking about that because I think I
wouldn't look too bad blonde I mean I
don't know I can't really picture it now
since my hair is only dark but I really
wouldn't care but it's kind of too late
figuring that my hair is really dark now
and I know that if you try to go blonde
it's just gonna like turn your hair
orange so too late for that
- me and my brother spy lot well marcin
which is like my oldest oldest brother
we don't fight at all um we're pretty
cool were chill and then Kevin is just
like I don't know he bugs me that's what
he does and it's just you know he's he's
obviously like 17 of you know um you
know I'm 15 so we always like bicker at
each other but um it's a lot better than
how it used to be used we used to like
fight all the time and now it's getting
a lot better but like you know I mean
what are you gonna do like brothers and
sisters always fight so yes
did I get my eyebrows done I get this
question asked surprisingly a lot and no
I do not um I like tweeze them myself or
whatever um and also a lot of people ask
if like I fill in my eyebrows okay
obviously since I dyed my hair a lot
darker my hair used to be you know a lot
lighter so my eyebrows are light lighter
so sadly I do have to like fill in my
eyebrows every single day which sucks um
I basically just use this like elf
eyebrow kit thing it's just I don't know
so it sucks like I have to fill in my
eyebrows every day because otherwise it
like won't match um but that's what you
get for dyeing your hair
my favorite item in my room um gosh I
don't know probably my computer um but I
mean that's that's just kind of I don't
know I kind of like my cork board thing
that's or that poster Marilyn Monroe
faster I don't I just I like my room so
I can't really like choose an item
um this is why because quite a people
ask me this on my video and yes I will
marry you I don't even know who you are
but you know it's ok we'll marry each
other
to have any pets um I I wouldn't even
count this as a pet because they're like
half dead but I have three fishes or
fish in my kitchen and one of them
stands like vertical like a person and
then one kind of like stands the other
way and then one kind of just drifts off
I don't know I think they're like slowly
dying or something but yeah they don't
even count as bad so I guess I have like
they're like they don't even they're
just like half like they don't even
count as like this because they're like
dead I don't even know what's wrong with
them we want to like get rid of them but
I feel so bad but I don't know so I have
three fish but I know
so I cry movies yes I'm a big like I cry
a lot during movies well not that much
but sometimes I don't know like for
example I cried during the last song I
love that movie a walk to remember the
notebook what else it's just like your
typical movies that everyone cries at um
Finding Nemo did I cry during that I
have no idea I don't know but yeah I I
guess I do cry movies
worst thing that I've ever done um I
mean I've definitely done some pretty
bad things um but like I don't know my
parents just my parents are pretty like
like chill and like relaxed and cool
about those kind of things you know um
so I've never really made my parents
like extremely mad at me I'm always I'm
pretty much like 95% on their good side
usually so it's not like that bad one of
the things the latest like bad thing
that I did to my parents was well I did
this to my mom um basically there's this
there's this like mystical this holiday
in Poland and it's called schmegle sting
goes it's basically it's kind of like an
April Fool's but not really and what you
do is you like pour buckets of water on
people I don't know who the heck made
this holiday up but it's really fun um
and before school I woke my mum up by
dumping a water bottle on her head and
she got kind of mad but it was funny so
I mean she wasn't that mad I don't know
but I thought that's funny so thumbs up
if you guys like do that kind of stuff
to your parents tubes it's fun
yes I've been to quite a bit of concerts
um I have been to a Madonna concert long
time ago Beyonce concert um
Jennifer Lopez yeah I'm pretty sure
Jennifer Lopez the Spice Girls I went to
the Spice Girls like last concert and I
love them I'm so sad that they're not
like a group anymore but you know
they're all older and on with their
lives but I went to there like last tour
whatever um what else I've been to like
other like Christmas stuff and just like
random concerts like tri-sorb Aryan or
something like that
I don't even know um what else I feel
like I've been to others but I just like
can't like think of them right now I
don't know I can't think Lee right now
there are books I have a lot of favorite
books okay well first of all I have one
of my desks let me go get it
um twisted very good um this is
definitely a teen book so I say like
seventh grade and a poor eighth grade I
don't know but it's really good book
definitely not for children I mean they
kind of say that like the first page of
the book but if you're like mature and
stuff this is a really good book my
brother actually recommended me to this
and then also I love the Hunger Games
that series is so good um what else I
like the alphas and like the click books
and stuff like that I just added all
they're really cute a cute books I want
to start Harry Potter books soon cuz
I've never read those for 12 books um
yeah I don't know I mean I'm not really
that big of a reader but if there's like
a really good book they'll get into out
like finish in like one day so yeah the
guess that's kind of like my favorite
books I don't know
yes it does and it freaking stinks okay
because our school dress coat is like so
like serious about it for example our
shorts like when you put your hands all
the way down to your sides your
fingertips
that's how short your shorts can get and
when I put my hands down my hands go
like really close to my knee like
halfway down my thigh but like kind of
more than that it's like okay no one
owns shorts like that like like I unless
they're bermudez like I don't know any
place that sells shorts like that long
you know when you get like Abercrombie
in shorts and stuff they're just kind of
like that regular like shorts length and
it's like I can't wear any of my shorts
this really stings and if you do then
teachers like catch you and like gym
short you and then you can like get in
trouble for that and then also which
stinks is you have to have your
shoulders covering which also saying so
for example I cannot wear this shirt to
school um once I get into high school
they don't have a school dress code so
I'll be able to wear like shirts like
this and like shorts and stuff like that
so I'm happy about that but I just gotta
stick with the dress code for now
my favorite Disney Princess probably
Ariel the she encounters princess yeah I
think she does um I was obsessed of the
Little Mermaid when I was younger like I
honestly wanted to like dye my hair red
because I loved her so freakin much and
then I also like you need bees and
Sleeping Beauty and
have you had your first kiss yet um this
also was a really really really really
popular question that you guys have been
asking and yes I have I think I had it
in like seventh grade or something no
but yes I have and kind of awkward I
don't know I mean it wasn't really that
bad but yeah so that was like so great
no no it's not at all okay it might look
kind of clean from here and that's
because you guys don't see what's going
on around me
why don't I actually show you guys
because I honestly don't care look at
that I don't know actually it's not too
bad
sorry I just like shook the camera
anywhere but I mean it's kind of messy
down here where my feet are so I'm not
going to show that
okay can you show us your outfit yes let
me just get in a good camera angle so I
can do that every single thing that I'm
wearing right now is from forever 21 so
that's kind of sad but yeah okay so
first off I learned these skinny jeans
that are like all ripped up obviously
you can see and these are from forever
21 and then also I'm wearing this really
looks like white shirt and this is also
from forever 21 it has really pretty
like lacy details on the front and the
back and then I'm wearing this necklace
with rk1 and it kinda reminds me of like
a dreamcatcher type thing I don't know
and then my hair I just have it like
this well actually I have it in a
headband during the video just because
it's bothering me but I don't really do
anything and then my makeup is pretty
neutral I um yeah that's my outfit it's
not really anything special also I'm not
wearing any shoes right now just because
um it's kind of moring and I haven't
really gone out yet so I don't really
know what shoes I'm gonna wear probably
just like white flip-flops so yeah that
is my outfit okay so that is it for
today's video just comical if you guys
want me to answer some more questions
because I don't think I really answered
that much I don't know but um yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed today's video and
comment below if you have any more
questions that I I guess I can make
another one I don't know um but yeah
that's it for a choice video and I'll
talk to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
