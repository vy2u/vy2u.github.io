it called so today we are going to be
doing the anti boyfriend tag which was
created by a dubs here on YouTube we
have been planning to do this for how
long like a year did not know I'm not
kidding like a long time since November
16th so we are finally getting around to
doing it because we're both single
this is Neeley hello and it's no fear
beyond beauty beyond beauty beyond
beauty moon BPM check her out we are
both single and we we're ready to mingle
and we decided hey let's still mr. Heric
today number one what is the one most
important quality you look for in guys
just one just one just one
um I think you have to be smart because
I couldn't handle talking to someone who
someone is like I'm not a so marvey I
know that how do you have conversations
that doesn't make sense to do so um what
about you I think I would say humor a
sense of humor that's like it's not like
joy yes I don't know I got there kind of
go like hey man yeah sure like if you if
you're not funny like you're boring it's
just awkward okay no sure who are you
right now number two what quality is me
turn off I'll answer
well like it's cool central ok so mine
would definitely be cockiness like like
I hate when guys like things I can get
like a key I just I think
- like think they can get everyone like
they want and like not I mean like I
think guys with Betty Betty because if
your teeth are furry in yellow
Marie I had the first person in mind I'm
thinking of that so you wanted free to
looking well if your teeth are like
yellow and girls I don't like you
already
number three what physical feature do
you notice on the opposite sex
first toenails in this summer I look for
your toenails so have nice toes and I
like you basically after I look at your
toenails is a cool feature so your arms
maybe arms because if you have like a
nice body your arms are nice I don't
know I guess I are returned about body
here or just like physical feature and
generally yeah um smile smile that's a
good one to y'all feel those teeth and I
already hate you so Ferris I'm an
excellent scratch district does describe
your dream date beyond beauty star okay
let's be on beauty stars a dream my
jeggings day okay I would say a theme
park because I love roller coasters and
I think they're very fun and they can
definitely be cute
yeah a little you holding hands and
scary I went on there yeah I like freak
out every time we like go up but then I
love it at the end so it's like a
love/hate thing I'm gonna do that
maybe just maybe I don't know if it's
like my standards okay dream date go
well since we live near Chicago I think
my dream date would have to be like Lake
Michigan like a trip to the beach number
and dinner maybe your lunch and they
just spawned it's cute could be so thank
you number five who would just celebrity
boyfriend be do I even have to answer
this question like don't even watch my
video so you don't even understand no
I'm a few a little bit for those who
don't know or don't it is
mine would be Denzel Washington 58 I
like them old I'd rather say no I will
do the bear yeah it would definitely be
chaste Crockford from Gossip Girl may
Archibald because I've had the biggest
crush on him from watching that show
he's so he's so cute and he seems like
he's such a cool person I was always a
fan of like him and Serena together he's
fabulous I are so cool they were like so
cool what is your relationship
deal-breaker so something that you might
end a relationship because of I did not
plan this out I know no point to yeah
like a minute ago I burped in Freddie
Neeley
and I I guess that answered her question
to number six which is what is your
relationship deal-breaker and it is
people who like burp in my face good
thing I love you to death so don't do it
I can't burp on command I really wish I
could
there's no way I'm do you can't nope
yeah I've never I do it ever heard the
skirt ah ha ha
I've never heard this goober before and
I wish I could burp in your face
um my deal-breaker would be doing
everything
no deal-breakers um I just feel like I'm
like and I feel like I'm like saying the
same answers but I just had Allen cuz I
want to say like the deal-breaker would
be like people they're awkward I think
that kind of goes with like how I said
like you have to be funny you know yeah
so I just I don't like person so
basically each other in that question it
but like opposites attract so that's I
mean clinic saying exactly what so you
will see the number seven what is your
relationship deal maker so something you
would like a guy to do in a relationship
um going off with you said about people
not being awkward someone who has fun
yeah I'm likes to do things I guess yeah
maybe some outdoorsy I yeah I feel like
the deal maker for me is people that are
like I don't know how to say this like
they are fine with doing like nothing
and doing something I mean like no yeah
well things like funky being boring and
sitting around or at going off an
adventure like yeah could just like
watch a movie with but then again like
go outside I don't know
I need like go just change stuff like
ice skating or boys recently
what I in here carrying on it
race what I am here color do you prefer
I like light eyes and hair there's you
can have brown hair blonde hair I yeah I
don't have hair I color
I feel like blondes and browns just like
what to say you didn't and then eyes we
see like blondes and brunettes obviously
obviously like both so yeah if I can't
make the decision for my own hair hit
number nine he buys you a gift what
would it be
this one no we were talking about this
one and like little arsons hard
we both had shoes but she put like help
me boys gonna get shoes yeah like this I
haven't no we don't know we don't have
boyfriends but inappropriately by your
girlfriend she shoes I filled with
jewelry
it's like hit earnest yeah it's like
it's like and do it once like don't like
do a morning so I've met jewelry is like
a one-time thing it's like you know I
something it could be cute maybe like a
concert ticket as oh my god yeah I just
love different kinds of us and I wanted
my my phone that's equal yes he does I
shop with him for them um yeah like no
he's has their go to get them for sure

think I also like gifts that aren't like
actual gifts it's like like they like
say like plan a day for you and you like
don't know what's gonna is I
and I can't think that - but obviously
that's like never happened - because
