made a video in like 10 days and I
apologize for that but I've just been
very caught up with school work and just
projects that are going on and projects
that are happening in the future so I've
just been really stressed and
overwhelmed and stuff but i am going to

let's get on with the video now I'm
going to start out by showing you guys
my favorite beauty products of April for
the past month I have been going
absolutely crazy with red lips I have
been wearing them to school when I go
shopping when I hang out with friends
like honestly all my guy friends
probably think I'm a freak because I
wear them that often but I have been
loving to red lip products specifically
the first one is the Revlon lip butter
in the shade wild Waterman Waterman
watermelon and I absolutely love this
shade I think it complements my skin
tone really well it's not too pinky it's
not too orange it's just right in the
middle and of course since it is a lip
butter it is very very moisturizing and
I also like that the color is very
buildable so you can make it very sheer
or you can really build it up and make
it look very bright and this is actually
what I'm wearing on my lips right now as
you can see i added on
like three coats maybe to this so yeah
I've been really loving that the other
lip product that i have recently
rediscovered because i bought this a
while ago but it's the beyonce l'oreal
lip infallible lip color and this is in
the shade beyonce read the reason why i
love this is because when it goes on
your lips it will not come off until you
take it off and to take it off you
either have to scrub it off with a
toothbrush or you have to use some sort
of oil based makeup remover to get it
off so that's what i really like so if
you're going out and you're going to be
eating and drinking and you don't have
time to you know fix up your makeup then
this is the perfect red lip for you
because it does not go anywhere I
promise you this i love these two
products very much they are definitely
my go-to at red lip colors now I've got
a bunch of different face products that
i want to show you guys so this is
basically like my everyday foundation
routine minus the concealer but whatever
it's fine so first off with foundation i
have been completely in love with the
hello flawless oxygen wow brightening
makeup by benefits i'm in the shade
petal and it matches my skin tone right
now perfectly which is great and i would
say it's about it's in between medium to
full coverage so it really does cover
everything up and it doesn't melt off
your face it doesn't make it look oily
so overall i just think it's a very
great foundation now on top of that i
have been a setting my face with the
Revlon nearly naked powder I feel like
everyone is talking about this now so I
decided to try it out for myself I'm in
the shade fair but overall this is
probably the best drugstore face powder
that I've ever tried so I think that's
great because normally by Mac potters
and those are like thirty dollars so i
think this is really great for the price
and I've just really enjoyed it oh it
does its job so it's nice my next
favorite is the bronzer that I've
currently been using and I don't know
why but my too faced chocolate soleil
bronzer decided to go missing just don't
know where it is after a week of trying
to find it I finally just gave up and
bought the hoola bronzer by benefit and
it's really nice it definitely reminds
any of my other bronzer because it's
matt and it's around the same shade so
it's just really nice for contouring or
making your face look tanner and stuff
and it doesn't look fake at all so yeah
and of course the packaging is really
cute too so that's like a bonus my next
favorite is the Urban Decay d slick
makeup setting spray and i just finished
using the all nighter one and i really
liked it but i decided to go with this
one instead because during this time of
year my face gets super oily and i
really like it i also really like the
new packaging as well i think it looks
very clean and sleek and stuff because
before it was like a rainbow bottle or
something like that so yeah i really
like this i use this every single day I
always set my makeup I think it really
does make a difference and it definitely
keeps to kind of keep the oil controlled
my next favorite is the self-tanner that
I've been using and love Lauren
Elizabeth has been talking about this
self tanner for the longest time so I
decided to pick it up as well and is the
st. rope as bronzing mousse this stuff
is amazing I will never go back to
anything that I've ever used it is so
nice it smells amazing it works fast
when you pump it out it comes out in a
moose form and i definitely recommend
buying one of their mitts to apply on
the self-tanner because your hands are
going to look like this if you don't get
one so I definitely definitely advise
you guys to do that and this isn't
expensive it's like six or seven dollars
which is fine and I also think it makes
the process of applying it on a lot
easier because it just helps to blend
everything out and stuff so got by buy
one of these it is actually it's for all
of my beauty favorites now let's get on
to what my fashion favorites now I've
got two purses that I want to show you
guys the first one is this little black
fringe crossbody bag from brandy
melville yeah I think it is very cute
and it matches with a lot obviously
because it's black I think the fringes
on this purse just make it so sassy and
like Ray the next purse is a bigger bag
I would be lying if I said that I've
been using this the entire month because
I recently just got it but i just want
to show you guys because it's freaking
beautiful and I'm obsessive it it is
this big bag right here from Windsor
it's like a light topi color and it's
got little studded detailing on the
bottom and it's just a big simple bag
that goes with all my outfits it's
actually sold out online right now but I
know that it will be back up in June so
if you want to check out this purse um
be on the lookout for that but it's just
perfect for when you go shopping because
it fits everything and there's also like
a little divider in here and then of
course it has a bunch of little pockets
so it's just the perfect day bag to do
whatever you want to do my next
favorites are scrunchies and I have been
wearing these like crazy during the
month of April all I do is I just twist
my hair into a little top knot and then
I just place the scrunchie over it to
secure it and I think it just looks so
cute it has like that innocent kind of
retro old-fashioned look to it and I
just think it is so adorable with like a
cropped fitted tee and like a
high-waisted skirt I don't know so these
three are all from american apparel they
honestly come in every single pattern
and every single color that you want so
I've got this black and white one that's
like a tribal print I've got this light
blue one that kind of looks like denim
and then also I just have a black simple
one they're just really fun to play
around with because you can put them in
your buns and your ponytails and it
looks so freaking adorable so I'm
definitely going to be purchasing more
colors because I wear these all the time
so those have been my favorites my last
fashion related favorite is a denim
jacket and this one is from brandy
melville it just looks like this it kind
of has like an acid-wash look to it it's
a little bit darker than the one that I
got while I was in New York and it's
also not crapped there's just something
about this jacket that I really love I
think it's just the fact that it kind of
looks old fashioned and stuff but I've
been wearing this everything I wear it
with leggings with pants
and skirts and dresses and just a bunch
of stuff so now let's get on to my music
favorites of the past month the first
song that I've been loving is Northern
Lights by cider sky I'll give you guys a
little preview
I
it's just a very cute and chill song
when you're doing homework and stuff the
next one is global concepts by robert d
long this song has actually turned into
my cleaning song i like to listen to it
when i clean my room because it starts
off really slow and then randomly it
just gets really upbeat and it just puts
me in such a good mood so let's play it
see the substance I'd use the other
player did i'll make you fucking band
there's that song next up I've got eyes
extended mix by cascade this song puts
me in the happiest mood ever I don't
know why like I just I smile when I
listen to this song this one's more like
upbeat techno ish
you
next music favorite is actually an
artist and his name is Mike snow with
two eyes and I've just been loving a
bunch of his songs for example a horse
is not a home is really fun it's like
upbeat and it sounds like this
there's this one too song for no one so
that is it for today's video I hope you
guys enjoyed it and if you did make sure

soon and I love you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
