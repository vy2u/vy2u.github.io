my April favorites and I know I have not
made a video in like ten days and I
apologize for that but I've just been
very caught up with school work and just
projects that are going on and projects
that are happening in the future
so I've just been really stressed and
overwhelmed and stuff but I am going to
be filming a bunch of videos this
weekend so hopefully we will not have
this 10:00 break period again before I
start showing you guys my favorites of

with the video now I'm going to start
out by showing you guys my favorite
beauty products of April for the past
month I have been going absolutely crazy
with red lips I have been wearing them
to school when I go shopping when I hang
out with friends like honestly all my
guy friends probably think I'm a freak
because I wear them that often but I
have been loving to red lip products
specifically the first one is the Revlon
lip butter in the shade wild Waterman
Waterman watermelon and I absolutely
love this shade I think it complements
my skin tone really well it's not too
pinky it's not too orange it's just
right in the middle and of course since
it is a lip butter it is very very
moisturizing and I also like that the
color is very buildable so you can make
it very sheer or you can really build it
up and make it look very bright and this
is actually what I'm wearing on my lips
right now as you can see I added on like
three coats maybe two this
so yeah I've been really loving that the
other lip product that I have recently
rediscovered because I bought this a
while ago but it's the Beyonce L'Oreal
lip infallible lip color and this is in
the shade beyonce red the reason why I
love this is because when it goes on
your lips it will not come off until you
take it off and to take it off you
either have to scrub it off with a
toothbrush or you have to use some sort
of oil-based makeup remover to get it
off so that's what I really like so if
you're going out and you're going to be
eating and drinking and you don't have
time to you know fix up your makeup then
this is the perfect red lip for you
because it does not go anywhere I
promise you this I love these two
products very much they are definitely
my go-to at red lip colors now I've got
a bunch of different face products that
I want to show you guys so this is
basically like my everyday foundation
routine - the concealer but whatever
that's fine so first off with foundation
I have been completely in love with the
hello flawless oxygen Wow brightening
makeup by benefits I'm in the shade
petal and it matches my skin tone right
now perfectly which is great and I would
say it's about it's in between medium to
full coverage so it really does cover
everything up and it doesn't melt off
your face it doesn't make it look oily
so overall I just think it's a very
great foundation now on top of that I
have been setting my face with the
Revlon nearly naked powder I feel like
everyone is talking about this now so I
decided to try it out for myself I'm in
the shade fair but overall this is
probably the best drugstore face powder
that I've ever tried so I think that's
great because normally I buy Mac powders
and those are like $30 so I think this
is really great for the price and I've
just really enjoyed it um it does its
job so it's nice my next favorite is the
bronzer that I've currently been using
and I don't know why but my Too Faced
chocolate Soleil bronzer decided to go
missing just don't know where it is
after a week of trying to find it I
finally just gave up and Botts the hoola
bronzer by benefit and its really nice
it definitely reminds me of my
their bronzer because it's matte and
it's around the same shade so it's just
really nice for contouring or making
your face look Tanner and stuff and it
doesn't look fake at all so yeah
and of course the packaging is really
cute too so that's like a bonus my next
favorite is the urban decay D slick
makeup setting spray and I just finished
using the all nighter one and I really
liked it but I decided to go with this
one instead because during this time of
year my face gets super oily and I
really like it I also really like the
new packaging as well I think it looks
very clean and sleek and stuff because
before it was like a rainbow bottle or
something like that so yeah I really
like this I use this every single day I
always set my makeup I think it really
does make a difference and it definitely
keeps to kind of keep the oil controlled
my next favorite is the self-tanner that
I've been using and love Lauren
Elizabeth has been talking about this
self-tanner for the longest time so I
decided to pick it up as well and it is
the st. rope as bronzing mousse this
stuff is amazing I will never go back to
anything that I've ever used it is so
nice it smells amazing it works fast
when you pump it out it comes out in a
mousse form and I definitely recommend
buying one of their mitts to apply on
the self-tanner because your hands are
gonna look like this if you don't get
one so I definitely definitely advise
you guys to do that and this isn't
expensive it's like six or seven dollars
which is fine I also think it makes the
process of applying it on a lot easier
because it just helps to blend
everything out and stuff so got by buy
one of these there's actually it's for
all of my beauty favorites now let's get
on to what my fashion favorites now I've
got two purses that I want to show you
guys the first one is this little black
fringe crossbody bag from brandy
melville yeah I think it is very cute
and it matches with a lot obviously
because it's black I think the fringes
on this purse just make it so sassy and
like Rea the next purse is a bigger bag
and
I would be lying if I said that I've
been using this the entire month because
I recently just got it but I just want
to show you guys because it's freaking
beautiful and I'm obsessed with it it is
this big bag right here from Windsor
it's like a light
taupey color and it's got little studded
detailing on the bottom and it's just a
big simple bag that goes with all my
outfits it's actually sold out online
right now but I know that it will be
back up in June so if you want to check
out this purse be on the lookout for
that but it's just perfect for when you
go shopping because it fits everything
and there's also like a little divider
in here and then of course it has a
bunch of little pockets so it's just the
perfect day bag to do whatever you want
to do my next favorites are scrunchies
and I have been wearing these like crazy
during the month of April all I do is I
just twist my hair into a little top
knot and then I just place the scrunchie
over it to secure it and I think it just
looks so cute it has like that innocent
kind of retro old-fashioned look to it
and I just think it is so adorable with
like a cropped fitted tee and like a
high-waisted skirt I don't know so these
three are all from American Apparel they
honestly come in every single pattern
and every single color that you want so
I've got this black and white one that's
like a tribal print I've got this light
blue one that kind of looks like denim
and then also I just have a black simple
one they're just really fun to play
around with because you can put them in
your buns and your ponytails and it
looks so freakin adorable so I'm
definitely going to be purchasing more
colors because I wear these all the time
so those have been my favorites my last
fashion related favorite is a denim
jacket and this one is from brandy
melville it just looks like this it kind
of has like an acid-wash look to it it's
a little bit darker than the one that I
got while I was in New York and it's
also not crapped there's just something
about this jacket that I really love I
think it's just the fact that it kind of
looks old-fashioned and stuff but I've
been wearing this everything I wear it
with leggings with pants
and skirts and dresses and just a bunch
of stuff so now let's get on to my music
favorites of the past month the first
song that I've been loving is northern
lights by cider sky I'll give you guys a
little preview
it's just a very cute and chill song
when you're doing homework and stuff the
next one is global concepts by Robert
DeLong this song has actually turned
into my cleaning song I like to listen
to it when I clean my room because it
starts off really slow and then randomly
it just gets really upbeat and it just
puts me in such a good mood so let's
play it
there's that song next up I've got eyes
extended mix by cascade this song puts
me in the happiest mood ever I don't
know why like I just I smile when I
listen to this song this one's more like
upbeat techno ish
the next music favorite is actually an
artist and his name is Mike snow with
two eyes and I've just been loving a
bunch of his songs for example a horse
is not a home is really fun it's like
upbeat and it sounds like this there's
this one two song for no one so that is
it for today's video I hope you guys
enjoyed it and if you did make sure to
thumbs it up I will see you guys very
soon and I love you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
