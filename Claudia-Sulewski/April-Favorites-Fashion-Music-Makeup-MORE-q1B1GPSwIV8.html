welcome back to the channel today i
would be talking about the different
beauty and fashion and random favourites
that i've been liking def mum i'm going
to start out with fashion favorites so
my first one it would have to be my
newest partis that i recently got i've
been wanting a holographic purse for the
longest time but for some reason all the
ones that I've seen in the past were
almost quite there and I almost love
them but not really something was always
off but i recently saw this bag on
nastygal.com so clearly it's holographic
its got like a snakeskin texture to it
also i love the black straps and the
little handle right here i actually uses
handle a lot more than I thought I would
i'll be using this back a ton this
summer and i'm just so excited my next
favorites are these shoes i purchased
these of my month ago and they have been
my most worn shoe since then they're
from hmm and as you can see they just
look like black vans with like a
snakeskin pattern may be more of a
pebble stone or like a crocodile I don't
even know I don't know but there's a
pattern to it and they're just so
comfortable so simple so they clearly
match with every outfit and they're
getting their get pretty dirty overall
if you guys have never tried H&amp;amp;M shoes I
definitely recommend them because
they're always so comfortable and they
carry really really cute shoes now the
swype saw a little crazy but recently i
have taken interest and doing this
really weird thing a lot of people do it
but it's working out still not really
having that much fun with it but
we're getting through it I'm going to
soon film a workout routine for you guys
because I have created a kind of a
system that I've been like and is really
easy for me now since I've been working
out a little more lately I wanted to
invest in a really good supportive
sports bra that is great for any type of
car do especially running and is cute
and all that stuff I am in love with
this sports bra it's from victoria
secret i'll have the name for right here
but I know it's specifically for running
and I just find it to be so comfortable
so supportive it makes you look super
flat chested because it likes stretches
really tight across because there's
really no padding in it they do have
like an underwire but it pretty much
just you know it keeps the girls in and
its really awesome for running so if you
guys haven't find yourself in Victoria's
Secret and are looking at sports bras
definitely try this one on my next
favorite would have to be this gray
cropped sweater that i got from nasty
gal kind of a few months back i feel
like this is a weird random favorite
that's really not exciting at all but
i've been wearing this a ton i love how
it's cropped because as you guys know i
like to wear a lot of crop tops so this
is perfect to throw on during the
nighttime or I'm chillier days it's also
super soft and fuzzy so this has been
like my most worn sweater / jacket my
next favorite would have to be layered
necklaces and I am very lazy when it
comes to wearing jewelry not in wearing
rings right now I'm wearing one earring
in my second hole so you could only
imagine how lazy i am with layering
multiple necklaces so recently I've been
really obsessed with wearing necklaces
that have multiple in one so all you
have to do is just put one on and it
looks like you have multiple my first
favorite would have to be the one that
I'm wearing right now I actually bought
this one from lucky brand which is
really weird to say because I never find
myself in that store but I saw this
necklace and I really liked it so I
purchased it I really like how it looks
with my smaller little diamond necklace
as well so I wear this combo all the
time and the other necklace that I've
been really liking is from urban
outfitters and it's just a two piece
necklace so the shorter one looks really
cool it kind of looks like one of those
tattoo black choker necklaces but it's
made out of metal and then there's just
a longer necklace with a little metal
circle at the end fun fact I actually
bought this last summer but I lost it
for all this time and recently I went to
the car wash and they found it
underneath one of my car seats I was
very very happy to find this because I
thought I lost it we're almost half a
year so now we're moving on to the
makeup favorites the first one is a
mascara and I can safely say this is the
best mascara I have ever used /
purchased and it's also from a brands
that I would never expect to make really
good mascaras but this is the bucs of a
strong and long mascara it makes them
fuller it makes them longer and make
some darker it does everything you want
a mascara to do so i definitely
recommend it I've had multiple people
compliment me on this even Jonah a boy
was like wow wait your eyelashes do look
a lot longer and I was like I'm telling
you it's kara I'm definitely going to
repurchase it because it's really really
good my next favorite would have to be a
blush and this is from the brand tart
and it's one of their Amazonian clay
12-hour blushes this specific one is in
the shade fearless it totally does not
match with today's look at all but I've
been loving this blush for the spring
time because it's pretty much like a
baby pink but it has lots of little gold
shimmer
isn't it so I decided to make your skin
look super glowy and fresh and girly and
flushed it's just so beautiful I really
really like these blushes I have been
loving the elf blush brush I
surprisingly have never owned a brush in
this shape it's kind of like a tulip
shape but it's a little bit flatter I
use this brush for so many things for
starters I love using it for contouring
because since it's a little flatter it
really helps to chisel in your
cheekbones but it's also great to tap on
blush also lately I've been using this a
lot for highlight it's really great to
just kind of tap on some highlight on
the top so your cheekbones yeah this is
really good I actually really really
like elf brushes so the next favorite
that I wanted to talk about has actually
been like an all-time favorite for many
months now but it would have to be one
of luscious bubble bars this one is any
scent comforter so as you can see I have
two of them right now this one came in a
smaller little gift package that i got
from with my friend rihanna in canoe
gianna and here is a larger one so this
is what they usually look like but as
you can see I've already ripped off a
piece basically you just rip off a chunk
and you crumble it under running water
and it makes your water just super pink
and bubbly and it smells amazing I
personally love this one so much because
it smells like bubble gum but not like
the annoying type of bubble gum smells
so out of all the products that I have I
currently have a pot of lush products
it's a bit embarrassing out of all of
them this is still my favorite and they
will forever be my favorite next up I
have a few random favourites the first
one would actually have to be a new
light source that I've been using for
filming it's actually right in front of
me right now and it is the Nova ring
lights I always see people using it in
their videos and I'm so glad i bought it
because it's a really good just central
light to have i actually have three
lights on me right now
window so there's a lot of light here
right now but I will say if you're
looking for any type of studio lights I
would definitely recommend the Nova ring
if you like to film up close shots
especially like tutorials you just put
the camera right behind the ring kind of
inside of it and it just illuminates
your entire face so I've been really
really liking it mean Oberon lately my
next random favorite would actually have
to be a jump rope I've had this jumper
up for probably a few years now I took
it with me to LA because jump roping is
one of my favorite kind of easy at home
workouts that you can do it's a full
body workout and you get tired very very
quickly don't really know what brand
this is but I like the length of it it's
really light and I would definitely
recommend getting it to jump roping if
you guys don't have like a gym
membership it's a great warm-up that's
usually what I use it for so that is all
for my April favorites I hope you guys
enjoyed it if you look in the
description box I will have a bunch of
music favorites that I've been loving as
well because I know that you guys enjoy
that part of my favorites videos and
yeah I will have my Twitter my Instagram
