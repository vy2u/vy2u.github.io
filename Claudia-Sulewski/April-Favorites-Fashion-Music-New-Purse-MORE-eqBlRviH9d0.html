doing my April favorites I've been doing
a lot of voiceover videos lately
those aren't as fun to film so I'm
excited to just sit down and blabble
away also I'm sorry if the lighting
changes throughout this video because
I'm sitting in front of a window and
using natural light because for some
reason and my eyes decided to be very
sensitive today so every time I sit in
front of the studio lights my eyes just
start burning so hopefully the Sun
doesn't hate me today and it will stay
like this oh god is that gonna be
annoying yeah I apologize in advance for
that as well that might be distracting
my first favorite would have to be this
face sponge right here this is the first
time I've ever used one of these sponges
normally I just use my fingers or like a
soft face brush but I really like it
because it's the perfect amount of soft
and rough so it gets deep into your
pores and really scrubs off all the dirt
and makeup but it's not like harshly
exploiting your skin the only thing that
sucks is because it's from julep I don't
think I could buy it in stores anywhere
if I want to purchase a new one I would
have to do it online we're just kind of
annoying so let me know if you guys know
of any companies that sell similar
sponges like this because that's would
be lovely
my next favorite would have to be these
sandals from Target and I actually got
these when I was in Florida during
playlist live which was in March but I
also loved them throughout April they're
a little bit fancier but they're still
very casual so I found myself wearing
them a lot throughout this month yeah I
really like these because they're just a
chestnut brown color and then they have
this really cute gold strap with a black
strap in the back they're really cute
affordable and matched with a lot of my
things
so love them my next favorite would have
to be the sexy hairspray clay and this
is a texturizing spray clay I got this a
while back so I've probably talked about
it before but I really like substituting
this for my hairspray because I feel
like this stuff gives my hair
like just why not I feel like it gives
my hair a really nice textured kind of
beachy look and it gives a lot of volume
as compared to the hair sprays that I
currently own okay and it smells really
good too I feel uneven I have to spray
it on the other side now so I've been
using this pretty much every single time
I curl my hair and I'm definitely buying
the full-sized once I've run out of this
my next favorite is the Nivea lip butter
again but this is a different scent
flavor it is the vanilla and macadamia
kiss which I'm still pretty new to these
I tried them for the first time last
month and you guys saw how much I am
obsessed with it I literally use this
maybe eight times a day I don't know but
it's incredible it's life-changing and I
like this one a lot more than the
raspberry one because it's all white so
it just lightly tints your lips lighter
and it smells so good oh my god I could
sit here and smell it all day seriously
guys if you have never tried the Nivea
lip butters you need to they're so good
my next two favorites I'm actually
wearing on my wrist right now the first
one is a Michael Kors watch and if you
told me about a month ago that I would
be purchasing my own Michael Kors watch
I would have laughed because I never
liked them I wasn't really a fan of them
I always thought they were cute but I
just never thought it was my style like
picture it Claudia wearing watches do
you guys see it because I never did but
when I saw this watch I instantly fell
in love I think it's really cool and
unique because it's two-toned so it has
silver and gold in it
so it will obviously match with whatever
jewelry you're wearing with it but yeah
I think it has the perfect amount of
sparkles and diamonds on it and it's
simple but still very unique and cute
along with my Michael Kors watch I've
been wearing it this Pandora bracelet a
ton if you guys have been watching some
of my past videos and if you follow me
on Instagram and Twitter you would
obviously know that I was on a cruise
this past month with Pandora jewelry and
Meghan ranks here on you
that trip is also one of my favorites
because it was amazing but yeah Pandora
let us customize our own bracelets so I
went with this two-toned bracelet that
has a gold clasp and I think these are
called rock star clips yes I got those
in silver and then I just have gold
spacers in between so I think these two
pieces really complement each other
because they both have the whole 2-tone
thing going on so overall I've just
really been loving this combo for the
month of April while we're black while
we're on the topic of my cruise trip I
also have one other favorite from there
and it would have to be my GoPro camera
this sucker is so cool I've been wanting
one of these for the longest time but I
just never had like a full-on reason to
buy one and I always just kind of
thought it was a waste of money but
Megan and I got to go on a bunch of
different excursions and adventures that
we're perfect for the GoPro but I also
got this chest strap which is really
cool you just kind of hook it around
your body and then it sits directly in
the middle of your chest so it's nice
because you don't have to carry it
around or anything I actually took this
camera with me while I was going down
the world's longest zipline in Haiti so
if you guys don't watch that video I
uploaded it onto my second channel I'll
have it linked right here as well as in
the downbar but that video turned out
really cool if you guys want to see the
quality of this camera and you know how
much you get to see in the shot then
that video is a perfect example but
overall I'm loving it my next favorite
would definitely have to be my number
one favorite of the month and it is a
purse it's very expensive purse
so before I show it to you guys I
quickly just want to state that I paid
for this bag 100% with my own money I
did not ask for any money from my
parents or anything and I've also been
wanting a nice designer quality black
bag for the longest time that would just
match to all of my outfits and would be
perfect for any occasion
so I know that this bag is going to last
my entire life honestly and
was love at first sight when I saw it
let's all just take a moment of silence
to look at it okay all right I'm gonna
put it down now
I know you guys got really excited sorry
I'm totally kidding but honestly I am so
in love with this bag I think it just
screams Claudius so much like if I was a
bag I would be this bag so this bag is a
small antique on achieve on sheath in
all black I don't know what the name of
the color is but it's the one that's
Maps you can also purchase like a
shinier one it's oh my god it's just
beautiful if you guys are interested in
they updated what's my purse video
featuring my bag then you can let me
know by liking this video so you guys
want that I can most definitely film
enough to even one for you guys
my next favorite for the month of April
would have to be a tea and this is the
passion fruit papaya flavor from the
republic of tea company this is
definitely one of my favorite brands
I've never tried a flavor that I don't
like so the way that they describe it is
a fine black tea blended with the paya
pineapple and blossoms not quite sure if
it beats the ginger peach flavor that is
probably my number one favorite from
this brand but oh wait I don't know see
it's such a close tie it smells so good
it's very sweet and tropically so it
makes me feel like I'm on vacation when
I drink it oh it's just so good I'm
going to have like five cups once I
finish filming my next favorite is also
food-related and it is garlic salt this
has got to be one of the weirdest
favorites that I've ever featured but
recently I have just become obsessed
with this stuff I sprinkle this on
everything not even kidding
I love eating grilled and steamed
vegetables so I always like to sprinkle
a little bit of this on there I also use
this to season salmon any type of
seafood shrimp before I cook it I just
sprinkle some on and mix it up I
literally put this on everything like
that's not an exaggeration I love garlic
I love salt so put them together and hi
my happy camper so if you guys haven't
tried this before oh my god I don't know
what you're doing you need to try it
now my hands are all greasy my next
favorite is a gum flavor and it is the
Trident limited edition jelly bean gum
see I thought the stripes are patch gum
was amazing but this gum is really a
game changer for me it tastes exactly
like jelly beans in my opinion it tastes
mostly like the watermelon flavor which
coincidentally is my favorite jelly bean
flavor so I really really love this
stuff and also it's just so cute and
attractive looking so why wouldn't you
want to buy it I don't know
my next favorite would have to be a nap
and I'm not sure if any of you guys have
heard it it's definitely new and not
very popular but it is called Instagram
it's AI NSTA
GRA M
yeah obviously I'm just kidding but
starting at the beginning of April I
actually started getting more into
Instagram because I've always loved it I
love looking at different people's
instagrams and stuff but as far as
posting goes I would only post like
maybe once or twice a week but starting
the beginning of April I decided that I
want to be a little bit more social on
that site and now I am completely
obsessed I post at least once a day so
if you guys did not know that I have an
Instagram I would be sure to link it
down there and now I'm sitting here
giving myself a shameless promotion for
5 minutes straight go follow me on
Instagram seriously next up I've got a
few music favorites and like always I do
not prepare them so I'm just gonna go
through my Spotify and find out what my
favorites are with you guys my first
favorite song would have to be waits by
m83 it's definitely a slower song but I
love listening to very calming and slow
music so let me just play a little for
you guys
yeah so I really like the melody of that
song and I also really like a signs by
block party I really like the xylophone
and at the beginning of the song I've
also really been loving it shells of
silver by the Japanese pop stars yeah so
I've really been obsessed with that song
BTS tu edit and it's by Jay Paul
the lyrics are actually very lovely in
this Sun yeah I really like that song
that is actually for my April favorites
I hope you guys enjoyed it I had a lot
of fun filming this video for you guys
so be sure to like this video if you
guys want me to do and updated what's my
first video and I will talk to you guys
