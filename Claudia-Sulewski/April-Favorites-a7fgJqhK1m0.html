my April favorites video first one is a
nail polish and it's the SE met about
you and it just looks like this in my
nails look really dirty because I just
had black nail polish on but I love this
it's a topcoat and basically what it
does is it like mattifies the color so i
actually just painted two of my fingers
red to show you guys before and after
and they got some dents in them because
i was like preparing for this video
while they're still wet so I'm sorry
about that but oh my god totally just
looked you guys off there but ok so as
you can see my middle finger is how it
looks before and this is big apple red
by OPI and then as you can see on my
index finger I have the SC nail polish
and you can see that there's no shine
it's completely mad I love this nail
polish so much because it just
completely changes the color and I love
putting this on black nail polish I
should have done that for you guys I
don't know why I chose red but oh my
gosh I'm black nail polish it looks so
so pretty so I've been absolutely loving
that my next favorite is this fan brush
and this is from the vortex collection
and it's pretty ironic because I know
that when I did a review on all the
brushes from this collection I actually
mentioned how I never use this I never
found a purpose or anything but recently
this month I ran out of my mac
mineralize skinfinish natural which is
what I use is my face powder so I just
had to use like a loose powder and I
realized that this is really good for
setting your face with a loose powder
because you just kind of like pack it in
there and that it's really like nice for
just kind of sweeping it across your
face and stuff so I've been loving this
brush for loose powder finally found a
purpose for it and it's actually been
working really great and I've been using
this every day like for pretty much this
entire month so my next favorite is a BB
cream and this is pretty new oh my god
why do I always drop things anyways um
this is pretty new to me this is the
first time I've ever tried to BB cream
and this is from Garnier and it's the
skin renew miracle
perfect for skin perfector I don't want
to talk too much about this because I
want to do a completely separate review
video about this so I'm not really going
to talk too much about it but it looks
like this I'm in the shade light medium
and I really like it that's why it's in
this video but um watch out for a review
for this product because I want to talk
more in detail about it but yeah so my
next favorite is a blush and this is by
the bomb I got this from hoot look kind
of a while ago but I've never talked
about it and I really like this blush so
um the packaging is so cute it's like
that paper kind of matte finish to it
reminds me a lot of benefit and
two-faced so yeah this is a super cute
like brand all packaging for the bomb is
really cute reminds me of those two
brands um so yeah it's called frat boy
and when you open it up it looks so
adorable it has like a little football
field and then there's the blush itself
it's like right in between a pink in
like a peach color so it's like a peachy
pink color super cute for the spring
time I'm going to swatch it for you guys
so you can see it right there it's so
pretty and I'm using this a lot since
you know it's springtime and yeah I love
that so my next favorite is a razor and
I used to be the one that would buy
those really cheap like disposable
razors that came in a pack of 20 and
those would not make my legs feel smooth
at all it would actually leave my legs
feeling very dry and just like irritated
and stuff so I decided that I want to
bust in a higher quality razor so I went
out to target and bought the Venus
Gillette pro skin moisture rich razor
this is the packaging if you guys gonna
see it um and yeah here's the actual
razor itself so I cute just like a blue
color I'm not really excited to
repurchase these blades because I know
how expensive they are but it's worth it
because it makes your legs feel so soft
and moisturized and smooth and it just
feels amazing so I've been really liking
this I like the smell of it um the color
matches to my bathroom that's one of the
reasons why I bought this one because it
not just my bathroom
just like really sad but I mean yeah I
really like it um and I don't know yes
it's definitely a step up from those
disposable ones my next favorite is an
accessory and it's just a watch and this
was a super cheap watch it was like 22
or twenty dollars at nordstrom rack but
I really liked the like leather right
here I don't know maybe it's fake
leather but um yeah it's by the brand
and Klein I've never even heard of it
but I don't know I just found it and I
thought it's really cute so it's just
very simple it looks like that and then
I just really like the strap of it it's
like a beige kind of brown color and it
matches to a lot of my clothes so I've
been liking that so my next favorite is
a purse and it is this satchel right
here I actually got this like two months
ago but I don't think I've ever
mentioned in a video before I know I've
tweeted about it before but yeah I don't
think I've mentioned it but I love this
sancho so much I've been honestly taking
this out everywhere because it's brown
and it matches to everything I like to
use my louboutin for like shopping and
stuff but this is better it's a little
bit more low-key so when I go hang out
with my friends or go to people's houses
i'm not bringing like a huge leotard
back i'm bringing a nice like little
satchel you guys know the name or the
style of this purse please type it in
down below because i don't remember it's
called like the front pocket slingback
or something we're like that I have no
idea but um it's just brown it has like
this khaki colored kind of strap so it
has a turn lock kind of pocket in the
front and if you guys want size
comparison if it's an iphone perfectly
in there and that it just has a zippered
main pouch right here which is actually
really roomy and spacious so yeah I've
been loving this purse and it's just
really nice so my last favorite is not
like beauty or fashion related at all
it's actually a song and I have been
obsessed with this song it just has such
a catchy like be to it it's called a
lady's by travis porter and it's
featuring Tyga I will leave the like
original music video down in a link
below so you guys can listen to it it's
seriously like
favorite song ever right now it is the
perfect song to go into like a
convertible and just bless the music
really loud and just like drive to this
song so that concludes my favorites
video I hope you guys enjoyed it and um
yeah I will talk to you guys for another
video very soon and that's it bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
