doing my April favorites video will
actually sell the stuff that I am going
to be showing in today's video I did use
like a lot earlier than April but i'm
just going to kind of throw it into this
April favorites video and if you guys
know I not really do monthly favorites
because I don't really like by that much
makeup very often so this is this is
going to be fun for me because I'm
barely are my favorites video so I'm
pretty excited oh but before I say
anything I'm going to take out my
brother bands because i still haven't
won my teeth I know how attractive very
cute I know ok so first I must start out
with makeup products I have a couple of
those so first off is the Mac I coal and
smolder which is just a black eyeliner
yeah I mean you guys know that I don't
really wear eyeliner that much on my
lower lash line so like I haven't really
used that many eyeliners before so I
don't know if this is really good or not
because for what I've used before this
is definitely the best one because I'm
not like an expert on eyeliner really
cuz I mean I don't know I wear it every
so often like I don't know if I still
like the look of me with a lot like
eyeliner on the waterline so I don't
know but yeah you can get this for
fifteen dollars at Mac it's pretty good
it glides on really easily which is
really nice so it only takes like two
seconds to put it on I like that also i
have been loving this product it's the
maybelline falsies volume Express
mascara and it's purple and looks like
this I mean you guys have all heard
about this and suma before and I think I
was like the only girl that has like
never tried it until now and I'm
obsessed with it I think you can get it
for like 65 like it's like five to seven
dollars at target i think i got it for
like buy something and i love it i'm in
love with this mascara and I don't think
I'm ever gonna like change because it's
so good huh something keeps cutting me
this is really annoying so sorry if I'm
like talking weird because something is
like cutting me right here on my brace
so the next product is the Revlon
Colorstay makeup
foundation definitely am in love and
obsessed with this product the only
thing weird about the packaging is out
of the Y but a bunch of foundation like
fell inside the lid which looks really
really nasty and kind of dirty and bad
so probable this happens to your
foundation to because this is really
bothering it's not like I cracked it or
anything it just kind of fell in man I
know it looks really bad but I really
really like this foundation I finally
understand why so many Jews were like
raving about this for a period of time
and I finally got to try it out and so
nice I have the normal to dry skin one
and also i am in 220 natural beige so
it's Alex so the next product is the
maybelline mineral powder finishing veal
and let me just say um when I want to
target and night to buy like a new
finishing powder because the one that I
used to for ran out I didn't really want
to buy this I just kind of like took
something because my brother he drove me
there and he was kind of getting me into
a hurry so I just kind of picked up like
the closest translucent powder that was
next to me and so this is like the
quickest thing I could find I guess so I
just tried it out I never really heard
anything about it um what I mean it's
actually pretty good like if you wanted
a really small and like inexpensive
powder or like translucent powder this
was actually really good leaves your
skin really like smooth and it keeps
your foundation lasting all day so I'm
still currently using this I really want
to try the new elf one which is like
three dollars it's like translucent
powder I don't know I'm obsessed with
like translucid like loose powder so I
don't know but I mean this is pretty
good it's not like my favorite or
anything so I just kind of like picked
it up on the go but it's pretty good so
I like that so because I'm in love with
like finishing powders and setting my
foundation sometimes like powders can
like make your face look really just
like not very dewy and glowy I'll just
make it look all like flat and like
caked on and dry and stuff like that so
what I like to do because I'm like
obsessed
I have to put some kind of powder to set
my foundation otherwise I feel like
gross and like sticky um so then my face
doesn't look all doughy and fresh and
stuff like that so that's why I've been
really liking this Revlon skin lights
face illuminator and basically it's just
like a liquid I mean you can kind of see
it coming out right there and I like to
use this as a highlight on my bridge of
my nose a little bit of my forehead on
my cheekbones the Cupid's bow and like I
much in a little and this looks so so
pretty when you put as a highlight on
your face because it kind of like it's
kind of like tinted pink and it's not
only that shimmery it just I don't know
it makes your face glow so I really like
it and especially since I'm obsessed
with like setting my face with powder my
face usually doesn't have that like glow
to it so after I use this I use this
after i put on my powder and makes my
face look amazing so i really like this
stuff okay this thing is really really
bad I me somethings like cutting into my
lip ok oh also a thing that I've been
using for a while actually now I would
be forever 21 that makeup remover wipes
so this one is in rows and cucumber the
only come with two I think and my
favorite is definitely a cucumber one
just because I feel like it's kind of
smells pressure and I don't know I just
love like cucumber and melon and stuff
like that like scented stuff like that
better but these are really good they
come in like big wife to come to 30 and
sometimes I just cut them in half
because you only need like half and um
these are actually pretty good and what
I like about these is sometimes what you
know on her lazy days and you just want
to go right to bed you'll just use a
makeup remover and then go out to bed
without washing your face well sometimes
I have that problem with makeup removers
that can you wash your face like with
the makeup and mover and like let it dry
or whatever like sometimes your face
just feels like sticking but oh so like
you have to wash it but after using
these and letting it like dry off and
you didn't like wash your face if I'm
making any sense right now your face
feels really smooth and like kind of
moisturize so like I just like the
feeling in my face after
using is it's not like sticky or
anything like that so I like these oh
and by the way these are only like two
babies so they're really cheap okay so i
think that is it for makeup products
when i'm not really sure because i kind
of did this in a hurry but yeah i'm just
going to move on to hair products right
now so the first thing is kind of an
accessory these little headbands are
here i'm obsessed with these i got these
from walgreens i'm not really sure what
brand they are they're just I don't even
know they might be the walgreens brand I
had no idea but you can get these at
walgreens for a couple dollars and
they're just they're kind of like
plastic but then they have this like
pattern to them and a like little spikes
like that and there's different colors
do I really want to get brown ones but I
actually really like these just because
I don't really have like bangs or
anything to my hair so like I like
wearing headbands a lot just so that I
can keep my hair in my face because my
hair is so annoying right now so I think
I'm going to go put one in that oh my
god that feels so much more better okay
but what I like about these is that
sometimes like hard head bands like
these sometimes hurt like the back of
your ears like they kill and be so hard
at all so they're really comfortable to
wear that's why I like these and I just
do like the colors okay so next you guys
know that you know I've been dying my
hair a lot lately you know trying to
trying out new things and new colors and
just kind of working with it and the
hair colored that I have right now I
think I actually like this is actually
permanent so it's not changing anywhere
and the hair dye that I recently used is
the l'oreal sublime mousse hair dye
which looks like this and I'm obsessive
it's tough with this stuff it's
definitely the best one that I've ever
used I've only used like three different
kind but this is how something keeps
cutting me now I'm going to freaking die
here okay it's like out sorry um anyways
so this is the sublime mousse um you
know hair dye looks like this I am in 40
pure dark brown and it looks like that
and I really like it because it's not
like a little bottle that you squeeze
had you actually have a little pump
thing which is right there and you just
like pump it into your glove and it's
like comes out like I'll go me and you
just kind of like work in your hair so i
really like it um it's fast and simple
doesn't smell as bad as some of them and
I don't know I definitely like the color
result a lot more than others that I've
used before so I really like this if any
of you use a L'Oreal hair dye you guys
know that they always come with like a
deep conditioner to use like every like
once a week or whatever and I'm obsessed
with these conditioners they're so good
they make your hair so soft and shiny I
seriously wish they sold them separately
so i have used three different kinds let
me go get one because I've been in it ok
so I've quite a bit of these you know
conditioners I don't know why I have
three at the same kind i think two of
them are my mom's or something but i
have used three different kinds i've
used the excellence creme one this one
was definitely my least favorite i don't
know i don't really like it then also i
gotta keep dropping everything also use
the healthy luck one which looks like
this which is actually really nice i was
obsessed with this for a while the only
thing is it smells like pasta like it
smells like pasta olive oil basil and
like Parmesan cheese thing altogether I
don't know why like I told my friend
that and she's like are you crazy I
think I am but it sounds like that but
then it was like floral at the same time
so I don't know it smell kind of pushed
me away from that and my favorite one is
the one from the hair dyed that I have
which is the sub line moose one and this
one smells fruity or flower Lee flowery
I don't know but this one makes my hair
so shiny and so soft I seriously wish
they sold this ugly because it's so good
and I I mean that's also good but like
it works so good and i love it and i use
it like twice a week because i just love
it so much ok next for shampoo and
conditioner I've had these for a long
time but I've never really talked about
these are the Burt's Bees pomegranate
and soy very volumizing shampoo and
conditioner I really like them they
smell good and they're like 97.2 percent
natural so I mean obviously they're good
for your hair the only thing that I
don't like is that the shampoo doesn't
lather as much as like other shampoos do
that I'm used to so it's kind of hard to
get used to them stay with the
conditioner just the texture both of
these like when you apply to your hair
like but just I think the fact that it's
like almost like a hundred percent
natural it kind of feels different in
your hair and you kinda have to get used
to like the texture of it and like how
it lathers in and stuff like that but i
really like it it's really good for your
hair and I need the very volumizing part
I don't think it really volumizer here
though because I didn't really see a
difference but I like these so yeah you
can get these at walgreens target
anymore okay also I've been loving the
dog cream oil shea butter body lotion
and it looks like this and I think the
main reason why I really liked it is
because number one it comes in a huge
bottle and second of all it smells so
good in my opinion it kind of smells
like cocoa butter and like vanilla and
like chocolate cookies like all together
but then again it also reminds me of
like vacation so I don't know but I love
the smell is strong like it smell so
sweet so I love putting her sound like
my arms and legs and stuff like that
once I come out of the shower so love
that okay so the next product I'm not
really sure what category you would put
this in I guess it's like everyday
essential kind of fashion I don't know
but basically they're the doctor souls
for her hidden arch supporters because
basically my feet are really close to
become flat-footed because during the
winter every single day I just wear uggs
which have no support on your foot also
and then like during the spring and
summer and fall I mainly just wear
flip-flops which once again don't have
any support for your feet so i finally
got these i think they like
nine dollars you can get them at like
Jewel or something but these are really
nice they're like here let me actually
show you how they look at the packaging
that's all ripped up but basically see
for example I put them on these forever
21 sandals because these things have no
support whatsoever they're just like
hard and flat and they're so bad for
your feet and arch and stuff like that
so basically it's like a little gel pad
thing and you pee off the sticker and
it's like sticky on one side and has a
little arch and then you just stick it
on your shoe and its really squishy and
I love it because you can put these on
flip-flops and trust me like you can't
see these when you're wearing them
because I mean you can't even see them
from here so yeah they look like that on
the show and I like them and they're
really fun to like squeeze because
they're all like mushy so yeah i really
recommend getting these if you're me if
you're like me who just was like uggs
and flip flops all year long but yeah so
those are good for your feet okay so I
have one last favorite and this isn't
butylated whatsoever but I got this like
exactly a week ago and I'm just testing
with it and it is the iphone 4 looks
like this i have the black version and
um i'm in love with this song honestly
i've been spending hours on it every
single day which is very bad but love it
so looks like that yeah i'm still
getting used to it why don't I show you
guys my favorite apps too i have a
couple favorite apps i don't really have
that many i think i have like four or
five number one is definitely netflix
like if you have a netflix up like
account definitely hook it up with your
iphone or ipod or whatever so you can
like watch movies and TV shows on the go
okay so another app that i've been
loving is food a kit which is fod at you
see a te and basically it looks like
this
huh okay so it looks like that and
basically what you do is you scan you
can see me in there you scan a food item
like for example I've got cocoa puffs
cereal right here you grab the serial
code thing let me just so you scan it
makes that noise and it says searching
for product and then it gives an overall
grade on how healthy it is and then
usually choice a picture right there you
go so for example this cereal gets a C+
and ng calories and then it's really
cool it like you can go on to
information about it that they don't
mention on the box which is really cool
and then also they have alternatives for
better like cereals and stuff like that
earlier like that app and it's free so
definitely check it out for my iphone
and ipod users the next one is teeny zoo
that I've been obsessing with I got all
my friends to be obsessed with it too
sorry my screen on my iphone is like a
really really dark because I use it at
nighttime and it's like that for your
eyes so that's why it's really dark but
it looks like this you just have like a
zoo with animals I gotta beat them i'm
such a nerd ok sorry i'm just cleaning
up everything so kind of looks like that
you can't see it cuz my screen is so
dark but it's really really fun you like
build your own zoo and stuff so I really
like that one I just got nike training
which I hear is really good it's like
it's kind of like training thing I don't
know but this is all free and then what
else yeah that's risk it so um that's
really it for today's video my next
video will be in like answers videos in
that question this video and then
fiscally it so scratch my second channel
follow me on twitter like my facebook
it's all going to be the dunbar so i'll
see you guys for another video and hope
you enjoyed this one all right bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
