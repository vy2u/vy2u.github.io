kind of short but before I get on to the
main topic I just want to mention one
thing and that is yes I did Li dye my
hair so as you can see it's pretty dark
again and I'm in love with it I love
love long dark hair I don't know why so
couple of you guys like any hair color
it's kind of it's like a dark dark brown
and I don't know I like it so not to the
main point of this video
last summer I made up questions and
answers like tech videos or basically I
just asked you guys to ask me questions
and then I would answer them in another
video and that was kind of a long time
ago so I decided that I wanted to like
remake that video so basically under
today's video I just want you guys to
answer or not answer but type in any
question that you want me to answer down
in the comments below under this video
as long as first of all they're not
perverted or like inappropriate and
number two that they don't like give out
personal information and stuff like that
so as long as they follow follow under
those rules then those are all so but
before I let you guys comment below
asking me questions that you want to
know by myself I'm going to answer a
couple of today's video just because I
feel like some of these questions have
been asked like billions and millions of
times so I'm just kind of wanted to
sorry that was my email I just kind of
want to get them out of the way that so
that like I don't know you guys don't
have to ask them anymore so number one
is what is your ethnic and the city how
do you even say it like where a grant
come from I don't know I'm sorry I'm
like half retarded but I'm a hundred
percent polish and therefore both my
parents are 100% polish because a lot of
a lot of you guys ask me what my parents
are because obviously you can tell that
they have a really really strong accent
so yes they are from Ole Scott and I
wonder except polish so yeah that's
really asked and then also another thing
is Katya when we do a real tour and I
don't know yet I still have to
get one more like piece of furniture
because I just like need my room to be
like complete and then when it's
complete I'll do this video for you guys
um what else
also Claudia what state do you live in
I'm not gonna say you guys know oh no
I'm not going to tell you guys where I
live so don't ask those kind of
questions like that's the only thing
that you guys can know is that I live in
America yes what do I use in my videos
and I use iMovie o.9 which just came on
my macbook but I think you can buy it
separately I don't know I really don't
know but I mean it comes to Apple
computers what else are there questions
oh also when am I going to make could be
questions and answers video with my
mother Kevin because just like he
promised on that one video if we get a
thousand likes then he would do it and I
told him and I keep telling him and he's
being really stubborn and he doesn't
want to do it so that's basically the
reason why I haven't done that video
because he's being stubborn and he
doesn't want to do it so that's why I
haven't done that video with him yet so
another question is can you speak Polish
and yes I can I am fluent with both you
know English and polish and I'm learning
Spanish right now and also if you guys I
know I want to hear me say something
polish I'll say something a bullish
right now chest weight is Claudia II

this nutty sweater thing from from 21 so
there's another question and yeah that's
about it for really really asked like
questions and stuff like that so if you
guys have any really interesting
questions that you want to know from me
or want me to answer them then just
comment below in this video and I will
do I think my next next video will be

like you need questions that you guys
want me to know and that's about it so
