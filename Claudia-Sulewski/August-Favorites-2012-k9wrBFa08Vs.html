weird because it's actually 7am right
now so i might seem kind of tired as
well but i have literally had no time to
do anything because of school and tennis
music because i have tennis every single
day and then I'm games on the weekends
and I wanna hang out with my friends on
the weekends so I've been so busy so I
decided to film a video before school so
first off my first favorite is my tragus
piercing which is right there I actually
got this on Sunday and I'm obsessed with
it I think it looks so cool didn't
really hurt that bad yeah I hurt like
the first second I got Pierce but it
doesn't really hurt anymore unless I
like accidentally touch it or whatever
so last week I went to a benefit event
with lolufullyloaded here on YouTube and
I was hosted by the girls of Lincoln
Park it was really fun and I got three
things from there and I've been loving
them so I want to show you guys those
products and yeah so the first one is
the benefit in sprout pencil you guys
know that I ran out of my browser go go
kick from benefit and I got my makeup
done there and the lady used this on my
eyebrows and I love it so so much
because the product itself is very
creamy so there's a swatch of it this is
in the shade medium and the best part is
that it has a spoolie on the end I'm i
always use a spoolie to blend it out
afterwards it's really nice that it has
it right on there so it's really great
for like school and on the go and stuff
like that and then my next favorite is a
mascara oh my gosh it's the they're real
mascara I think it's like number one
miss care in the world or something like
that I'd only know but love love love
this mascara I've only been using it for
like a week but um it's so nice so it
looks like that there's like a little
spike ball at the end so it's great to
get into your inner corners and outer
corners the last one is the
Porefessional pro bomb I've been really
liking this it helps to minimize your
pores and you just apply this before you
put on any
dation and i really like it because it
makes my skin at very smooth even want
to have like acne it kind of smoothes
over and then on I put foundation on you
can't tell that I have any acne which is
really nice and also just like using
this even if I don't wear any makeup
just because I feel like it just makes
my face look butter it's very
lightweight and its oil free and it just
feels very like silky and stuff then my
next favorite is a nail polish and I'm
actually wearing it on my nails right
now it's just like a dark brown kind of
chocolate brown looking color and it's
from this brand right here I don't know
how to pronounce that but i received
this in my oddest glossybox and I've
been really liking it it's in the shade
tinct fall is coming and obviously this
is a really really great color for the
fall season my next favorite is a
skincare product and it is the clean
clear advantage acne spot treatment I
put this on right before i go to bed on
any of my pimples and even the packaging
said that one hundred percent who use
this product see a difference in the
first try and I am NOT surprised because
this has worked wonders for my face
literally like you put it on it is nor
Sibley getting better the next day then
you put on a second time and it's gone
like this is so amazing so yeah there's
actually a lot of product in this as
well because a little goes a long way so
this will be less to me for a very very
long time so now I have a couple of like
fashion favorites so my first favorites
for fashion our statement leggings I
have liked for them right here also I do
sometimes instagram my outfits of the
days so I'm going to show them right now
or like a little bit later on some of
the leggings to show you how you know I
styled them maybe I'll do like a
lookbook for statement leggings tell me
if you guys would want that so yeah the
first ones I have here to show you are
these which are my favorite they're just
like ombre leggings so they go light at
the bottom and these are from Topshop
and I post a photo of these on there so
you can see that right now then I have
these ones what you guys have seen their
like the stone wash leggings from
necessary clothing they're pretty subtle
but they still are very unique so I love
those and then I have two from
gojane.com the first ones might seem a
little bit crazy but they are Union Jack
leggings these are so cool the material
of them is really really awesome it's
like kind of like ripples I don't even
know how to explain it and there's like
little see-through kind of splits in
there but it feels really cool and these
are just sick like come on now those are
there just you're awesome and then the
next ones might be kind of hard to show
to you guys because it's black but they
are black and then down the sides they
have like a line of mesh going down your
leg if you can see that but then it also
crosses over like above the knees and
then down there at the shins these are
so awesome they're so like edgy looking
my next favorite are these steve madden
boots that i recently got at nordstrom
rack um well that with me unfold these
but the interesting thing about these
shoes is that originally all I mean oh
gosh it started chipping off since the
last time I wore them but all of these
spikes and all the just little metal
details except for the zipper because
you can't really cover that they all
used to be gold obviously you can see I
need to cover that up but I put black
nail polish all over them because i
think these boots look so much better
with black spikes but i've never seen
these before I didn't even see them on
the website and I had to have them so
yeah what I did was just covered all the
spikes with black nail polish to let it
match to more of my things because I
have a lot of purses with like silver
Harvard on them so I think they would
just match to a lot more if they're
black but that's kind of embarrassing
because there's a couple chips on here
but my mom was yelling at me she's like
why would you buy shoes that you
even like and that you're just going to
cover with nail polish like it's just
it's just going to be trippin off every
time you wear them and I mean yeah I
kind of chips off obviously you can tell
but I mean I have no problem with just
quickly going over with some black nail
polish because only like a couple arch
it but um yeah for the most part i mean
the nail polish stays on pretty well so
I mean whatever it's worth it so yeah I
have these I've been loving these boots
so much I've worn them with skirts with
shorts with leggings with everything
guys I've been obsessed with these so
got beads from steve madden so there's
those and then my next favorite is a
leather jacket that i also got and
nordstrom rack during the same time
while getting these boots so it's by the
brand and move up but like i said i got
it at nordstrom rack and it looks like
this so it's kind of like a dark dark
dark brown almost black leather and um
so yeah I kind of look simple you know
whatever but the cool thing about these
is that the sleeves actually come off
like they zipper off here i'll take one
off for you guys and you can turn it
into a vest which is the coolest thing
ever because it's like two and one hello
and um hold on let me just show you guys
so yeah I actually wore this as a best
on Sunday and it looked so freaking cool
so as you can see no two best and now
it's a jacket so this is so cool can't
wait to style this more often during the
fall time super great it's really really
nice and soft leather so love that okay
and then I also have one more favorite
and it is probably the weirdest what I'm
just warning guys right now the weirdest
favorites I have ever and will ever do
you guys are probably going to be like
what Claudia this is like okay I'm just
gonna show you guys it's a fabric
softener um yeah so one day my mom sent
me off to target and she was like okay
can you buy some like laundry detergent
a software and I was like yeah sure so I
was going through and this bottle looks
really pretty and it smelled really good
so I was like okay yeah I'll take this
if you guys are wondering what this is
called it's the ultra Downey infusions
citrus spice and this is in my favorites
because I am obsessed with this smell I
do my own laundry and what's it called I
normally don't like the softeners that
my mom gets I don't know why like it
makes your clothes smell so like citrusy
and fresh I wanted to mention this in
chase fear because maybe some of you
already live on your own and you do your
own laundry um or if you want to like
recommend something to your mom then try
this out it really really smells amazing
and i have been loving this a lot i wish
i could just like leave this is my room
cuz it's so pretty good alright i'm just
getting weird now i'm just going to stop
there but that is it for today's video
oh yeah also if you guys want to see me
get my tragus pierced i actually
uploaded a vlog on my second channel
which is also featuring my brother Kevin
um so yeah I will leave that video vlog
in the downbar so you can check out how
I reacted when they pierced this tragus
your thing and I will talk to you guys
very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
