August favorites and it is so sad to see
summer leave but I'm also very excited
for the fall season because I'm obsessed
with the dark flips and fashion and
everything but I have got quite a few
things to show you guys so I'm just
gonna get right into it so I'm going to
start out with my a beauty favorites so
first off I have been loving the lorac
to go Pro palette this is my first lorac
product ever and I was very very
impressed with it so it opens up kind of
like an accordion looking thing and it
looks like this so it's got four
different eyeshadows and then it has to
highlight colors which you can really
use on your face or eyes which is really
nice and then also you get two blushes
and a bronzer and I'm actually wearing
the eyeshadows on today as well as the
highlight I think it's great for
traveling and just on the go so I just
really like the packaging of his product
as well as the colors I just really am
enjoying these eyeshadow colors lately
my next favorite is my Mac blush in the
shade Prizm and I got this a long long
time ago but I stopped using it during
the warmer months but it's just like a
dark Bobby Brown color and I think it's
great for fallout so I've been starting
to wear it lately and keep in mind if
you do plan on purchasing this product
it is very sheer but it's also very
buildable so you can make it look very
subtle or you can create a very bold
cheek look with this blush so yeah I've
been using this quite frequently my next
favorite are these lip glosses right
here these are the bare minerals
marvelous Moxie lip glosses and the
pigmentation of these is incredible
they're also very smooth and silky so
first off I got this dark red lip gloss
which I actually wore to the Taylor
Swift concert while I was in LA
in the shade a game-changer the next one
I have is in the shade party starter
which is like a dark kind of Corley
colors and then lastly I have the shade
rebel which is like a dark mommy pink
and I used to always stay away from
these colors because I just never liked
dark pink lips on me but I've been
really really liking this lately which
is really weird for me but it's just
like a mature pink color so these lip
glosses have been very fun to play
around with lately I've actually only
got one last Beauty favorite I know it's
kind of pathetic but I do have other
favorites though don't you worry but my
last Beauty favourite is a nail polish
and this is the OPI nail lacquer in the
shade 999 okay fine
it's like a dark gray color but it has
like a hint of blue in it since fall is
on its way I've been wearing darker
colors right now so I'm actually wearing
this on my nails right now next up I've
got two hair related favourites the
first one is a curling iron and this is
the new me signature magic wand and I
think this is in the thirty two
millimeter and this is the biggest like
curling iron that I've ever owned I've
only owned like the thinner ones it just
creates a really nice loose and natural
waves which I've been wearing a lot
lately and one of the cool things about
this curler
is when you set it to whatever heat you
want to it's like it shows up as blue
first and then it shows how hot it's
getting and then when it turns to the
temperature that you set it to it turns
green so it lets you know when it's
ready so I thought that was just like a
cool little aspect of it but yeah I've
been using this a lot lately and I'm
going to be using this in a future hair
tutorial soon so watch out for that hair
tutorial and my next hair lady favorite
is kind of weird I don't even know what
it's called to be quite honest but it's
by the brand kiss and it is a heating
mats hair curling protector matte heat
protector I don't I don't know what you
do is you basically just rest all of
your heating styling products on here
to protect whatever is underneath it I
got this while I was at beautycon so
it's still pretty new but when I got
this I honestly I thought it was the
most pointless thing a burger I never
thought I would ever use it but I've
actually been using this every single
time I curl my hair because if you guys
can see all of my furniture is wooden I
also have wooden floors and I've
actually burned my floors and furniture
multiple times from curling my hair so
this has actually become so useful for
me I've just really been liking this so
I decided to mention it in today's video
so I've also got a few of fashion
favorites that I wanted to show you guys
I'm so first off I have two bags that I
got this month and I really have no
excuse as to why I bought these at the
same day during the same time because
they are very expensive bags but I paid
for these bags with my own money and I
know that they will last me for years
and years and years because there's such
nice quality and I am obsessed with them
I decide I'm gonna show both of them to
you guys because I love them equally and
I've been using them pretty much every
single day since I've gotten them so
first off I've got this Marc by Marc
Jacobs bag I don't know what this style
is called all I know is that this color
is cement it's like a topi light brown
color which is perfect especially for
like the fall season and winter and
stuff but I mean I think it really works
with any season so it just looks like
this it's like a medium sized bag it has
a long strap uh I just got my lipstick
on it um and then it also has shorter
straps too I've been obsessed with this
and then the other bag that I've been
using a lot lately is also from Marc by
Marc Jacobs and it looks like this once
again I don't know the title of the bag
I do know that it's in the smallest size
of the style but this is in the shade
root beer I really like this bag because
it has a main pocket right here as well
as like a small one in here but also the
flap is like its own pocket as well
which is so cool so it unzips here and
then it's like an extra pocket that goes
all the way down the bag
I think that's really cool you can keep
like your money and cards and stuff in
here and then like everything else in
here it just works so well with all of
my outfits and stuff since they are
neutral bags and I'm in love with these
bags
my mom was surprisingly okay when I
bought these she was with me and she
approved so you know next up I have two
shoes that I've been loving this month
and they're both from Steve Madden so
first off I've got these booties right
here I saw Maddie bred here on YouTube
wearing them I think during was it
generation Beauty I'm not sure what they
looked so freakin cute on her and when I
saw these in the store I was like hey I
really like these I want them to so I
got these they're like a taupey color
they've got cutouts and stuff and
they're beautiful my next favorite are
these wedges right here which are also
from Steve Madden so they just have a
dark chocolate wedge with a lighter
brown strap in the front and then a
thick black stripe at the top and I like
these because you can wear them with
fancier looks or casual looks so they're
very versatile and they match with a lot
of my things I also really like the
height of these I feel like this is the
highest I can go with heels before I
start looking like a hooker
so they give me less and lots of height
which is nice because I'm very short so
I've got those next up I've got a few
food favorites so the first one is an
ice cream and I'm going with this one
first because it is melting on me right
now
it is the Arctic zero of frozen desserts
ice cream I can only find these at Whole
Foods so I don't know where else note it
what oh my god are you are you doing one
of those like song things again listen
this is really sincere yeah for real
right now
what's funny is I'm actually filming a
video right now bye that was Hudson he
was filming for a video hi anyways my
favorite flavor is cookies and cream
and I just love this ice cream okay
there's hair everywhere right now but I
like these because they're actually very
very healthy for you as compared to
other ice creams this entire container
is only a hundred and fifty calories and
it really doesn't have that much sugar
or sodium or anything in it I've been
liking these a lot I got like three
different flavors in my freezer right
now but this one is by far my favorite
my next favorite is kind of weird but
it's apple sauce I've been loving apple
sauce I used to hate it as a child and
now I'm obsessed with it I just think
it's a great snack for when you're like
craving something and you're like not
that hungry these are the moths this is
the original apple sauce and this is the
summer strawberry apple sauce I've been
loving EPEL sauce
my last food favorite are two teas that
I've been drinking lately and since it's
starting to become fall not really but
you know fall is coming I decided to
switch over my teas to more fall tasting
teas so the first one is the yogi
caramel apple spice snap tea it's a good
treat in between meals and it's
naturally energizing this tea tastes so
good it tastes exactly like caramel
apple spice definitely recommend you
guys to try this tea because it is so so
so so good the next one that I've been
buying lately this is actually a very
old favorite of mine I used to always
drink these during the fall season and
this is the vanilla chai chai tea tea I
really suck at describing taste so I
really cannot explain it but I'm just
gonna say if you guys want to try out
teas that kind of taste fallish and
stuff then I recommend both of these
because they taste so good so now I'm
going to show you guys a few of my music
favorites and I have not planned this
out at all
so I'm just gonna go through what my
playlists and find what songs I've been
loving so the first one is ways to go by
group love
I've been really really liking that song
also I've been listening to a live by
Empire of the Sun it's more like upbeat
and stuff
so yeah that song just makes me very
happy when I listen to it because it's
so upbeat and stuff
my next favorite let's see what is my
next favorite I've been liking the world
at large by Modest Mouse a lot this is
it it's like a slower song my next song
favorite is clams Casino
I'm God instrumental I'll have it linked
in the downbar but it sounds like this
it's so good this is probably like my
number one favorite song of the month
I feel so awkward just like sitting here
listening to them yeah I really really
like that song as well so I guess that
is it for my August favorites I hope you
guys enjoyed it thumbs up this video if
you guys are decided for fall and if
you're not you can still thumbs up this
video if you want it but I will see you
guys for a new video very soon and yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
