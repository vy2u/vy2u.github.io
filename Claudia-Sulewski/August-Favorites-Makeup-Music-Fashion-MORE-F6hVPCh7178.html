channel it has been a hot second since
I've filmed a favorites video on my
channel and I love making these videos
because I love talking about things that
I love that's pretty much it for my
intro just want to express the
excitement for starters these sandals
right here these take the cake for
number one favorite of all time they are
so comfortable I purchase these from
Nasty Gal specifically the brand Jeffrey
Campbell it doesn't cut into your feet
it's super comfortable there's a tiny
little heel so you get a little bit of
height in and they just make every
single outfit so much cuter and a little
bit more fancy but you're basically
wearing slippers love them
geez couldn't express it any more two
cases I want to talk about laptop and
phone I guess we'll start off the phone
this case is from case to five this case
specifically is just so cute in door key
in my opinion because it's like it's my
little man I like it's got a little tux
it's very representative of my life
right now because I'm so busy with so
many different things going on that like
the last thing that I'm thinking about
is meeting a dude this is like the
closest thing to me having a man in my
life right now which is which is my work
my work phone the other case I want to
show you guys is actually my laptop
cover so underneath it it's actually a
sticker and then I got a clear plastic
case over yeah oh by the way this video
isn't sponsored by anyone so this brand
is called unique finds and I am obsessed
with them oh sorry I have been buying
laptop covers from them for so long you
guys always ask about that like the grid
one the black marble one I have a blue
marble one I'll soon we will bring it in
one of my newest video a lot of you guys
are counting about why I own two laptops
and guys this laptop is like seven years
old it literally only runs for like
thirty minutes without a charger the OH
the reason that I still have it is
because I like to use this to edit my
vlog footage it's literally the only
thing that I can still do on this thing
and then this I just like travel with
and do all my emails and whatever so
yeah this is a piece of poo okay like
this should not be in my life anymore
but you have same brands so much fun you
guys know I'm obsessed marble - even
more confirm that statement my next
favourite also is marble all over I yes
I have three marble suitcases this is
the smallest one to carry on these
suitcases are from Cal pack the company
actually gifted me these suitcases they
are so beautiful so thank you so much
and yeah I took this one to London with
me and it just makes traveling that much
more exciting and this literally has
become a decor piece normally it's right
there I'm gonna go put it right there
and you guys are gonna be like whoa yeah
that looks good keep it there we've got
one a hair product and I got this at
beautycon it is a dry shampoo
it's the Paul Mitchell express dry and
it's a spray by far greatest spray dry
shampoo I've ever tried I feel like a
lot of dry shampoos leave like a weird
feeling in your roots or sometimes weigh
them down this stuff is super
lightweight and it also makes your hair
lighter like it gives it volume and it
feels actually clean salon-quality this
is the stuff my next favorite is a
makeup brush which I feel like hasn't
happened and so long so this is an eye
makeup brush from Real Techniques and it
is in the number 200 for starters I love
the look of it I love how sleek it looks
so the thing that I love most about it
is the shape of it I don't own an eye
makeup brush this large I've always been
terrified of larger eyeshadow brushes
but man was I wrong because this is so
great for just an everyday I makeup
brush if you're just wanting to put on
one color all over your lid into the
crease blend it out BAM
I will often use this with bronzer I'll
just pop some bronzer onto my lid and
kind of spread it out yeah it's like a
miracle one step I shadow brush that
just handles it all next up we've got in
eyes shadow palettes it's by the brand
NARS and it is their a long hot summer
outlet when I opened it I was so excited
because it has your classic
taupey brown color for the crease and
then it has like a shimmery version of
that so you have a choice you've also
got a classic dark brown matte eye
shadow my favorite part about this
palette is the two bottom left shades
they're a little bit more Pinker and
orangie so you've got those kind of more
copper tone eye shadows that are really
fun to wear and yeah I'm just really
obsessed with every single eyeshadow in
this palette it's very rare for me to
actually use every single eyeshadow in
one palette but she did it my next
favorite is more so a category of
products I've got to to show you guys
but I feel like all of them kind of do
the same thing it is cleansing water I'm
so happy that I discovered this type of
product because I use this multiple
times every single day mm oh my hands
are the Garnier skin active cleansing
water and then the simple skin cleansing
water I'd love to use these when I want
to quickly give my face kind of a
refreshing clean but not actually
cleaning it often I will use these in
the morning if I'm too lazy to actually
deep clean my face because you deep
clean your face at night at least I do
and then you're sleeping in bed you're
not really going anywhere or you're not
really exposing your face to any dirt
but you still wake up kind of feeling
like you need to wash your face because
your natural oils and maybe your
sweating whatever so this is the perfect
kind of everyday mornin product you just
squirts them on a cotton round wipe it
around your face and you're good to go
also I love face masks and a lot of
peel-off masks leave random little like
residue and stuff and rather than having
to like splash your face and like blah
blah you can just take a Conrad
with this stuff wipe it right off comes
off in a second so great forgot what
else I put on my list I put down
kombucha it's a drink I feel like
everyone drinks it out here literally I
took this out of my garbage and it's
empty there's no cap um but I just
wanted to show you guys bottle this is
the raspberry lemon flavor if you guys
are curious yeah kombucha is awesome
it's naturally energizing live probiotic
whatever that does to your body I mean
it's on the front so I'm sure it's like
a good thing it's really great I like it
and it's fizzy so that's it for the
material favorites now I'm going to talk
about a few other things music TV shows
stuff like that so for starters TV shows
unreal that show is unreal
it's a scripted drama about what happens
behind the scenes when filming a show
like The Bachelor
they call it everlasting on their
specific TV show but it's so cool
because you see how the producers
manipulate all the contestants and the
women and the guy and you know you're
seeing all the behind the scenes with
the crew and the crater is what's still
the drama within the girls and it's just
it's insane it's so interesting to watch
yeah there's two seasons available of
that let's get to music Spotify you guys
can follow my Spotify if you want I'll
link it down below oh my gosh first
favorite song of the month actually just
came out not too long ago the Great
Divide by Rebecca Black specifically
crash Cove remix guys
you
what oh so so good Rebecca showed us
this song before it came out and we
blasted it in our kitchen on the ceiling
speakers and it was so good we're all
freaking out and so now that it's out
and everyone can hear it is so exciting
because damn that girl he's been working
so hard and I'm so excited to hear all
of her music so Rebecca if you're
watching this I'll be here waiting
honestly if you just go through my
summer 16 playlist pretty much
everything is there running with the
Wolves by Aurora so good
we saw a lighted Lollapalooza and she is
just the cutest thing ever she was
exuding so much positive energy it was
so contagious and it put us all in this
crazy amazing mood
we were like front row let's see xoxo

Lollapalooza and it was very very happy
moment ah it's just so good to bump into
