in August favorites video and I'm so
excited because I have a couple of
makeup products and beauty products to
show you guys but I also have a couple
of non beauty products so I'm just going
to get right into it with like the more
beauty related things and I'm sorry I
have been made a video in like two weeks
and that's because my schedule is like
really really hectic and crazy right now
and the only time to ever have time to
like record videos is probably on like
sundays and chases Saturday but my
schedule kind of got changed and stuff
so I was able to make videos so I'm
really excited for that okay so recently
I've been really getting into elf
products just because I've been kind of
ordering more things from that website
because I never really used to order
things from there and one of the things
that I actually really like is there i
think it's like from the essence line
it's the one dollar line and it is
they're tinted moisturizers and these
are only one dollar which is like crazy
because these are really really good for
one dollar so i think these have like
SPF yeah they have SPF 15 mm i have
three shades just because I like to kind
of like mix them and kind of like
formulate like the right shade so I have
this one which is the darkest one I have
but it's actually really not that dark
and these are pretty like trenzas into
so you can really like work with it
stuff like that so this one is in let's
see toffee I think yeah I'm not really
sure but yeah it's the darkest one then
I have this one which is in honey and
this is like kind of my shade and I
really like it so it's like my shade
kinda I don't know and then i have the
lighter one which is in apricot beige
there's actually a lot of shades but i
have these this one it's like way too
light for me so maybe i'll use this like
during the winter or something so I
through those and they're really really
great for like one dollar and they don't
have that much coverage but you just
want something to kind of like give your
face like an all-over just like nice
what's a call ah so these aren't really
that great for blemishes but it's really
nice to make your face look really nice
and like flawless stuff so I like those
okay so the next product is the elf
mineral infused face primer I'm not
really sure how much this is but this is
their face primer and I love this stuff
this stuff is so great this reminds me a
lot of the Smashbox like photo finish
face primer where it kind of squirts out
until like a clear gel and then as you
blended in it's like kind of like a
matte finish like powdery smooth feel I
don't even know what you would consider
this but it feels so smooth and nice and
this is like definitely a pretty good
dupe for that one obviously the Smashbox
one is probably better than this but
when it comes to like price ranges and
stuff this is definitely the butter by
so I really like this stuff i've been
using it every single day before what's
it called before school and before i put
on my makeup and stuff I don't think
this has any SPF in it though but I love
that so the last elf products that I've
been loving is their high definition
powder and I know that this is six
dollars which is still really
inexpensive and it's in clear and I
don't think they have any other shades
but you estimate it just has like a
little poofy thingy number puff I don't
only use in it but yeah that's just like
that has little sifter and i absolutely
love this stuff it gives you faithfully
nice like matte finish and obviously
it's translucent and i really like this
and i love it packaging too so also i
have been obsessed with the covergirl
LashBlast volume waterproof mascara I
mean I know you guys all know about this
but I'm a total newbie like to this
mascara like I just got it as you guys
saw like in my new hall and I love this
tub it's so good I finally understand
why everybody raves about this it's
seriously
oh my gosh it's so it's my favorite
mascara ever so highly okay so the next
product is my covergirl and Olay simply
ageless sculpting blush and this is a
cream blush it looks like this oh my god
I can't even explain how much I'm
obsessed and in love with this blush
this is like by far my number one most
favorite blush that I've ever used my
entire freaking world like in my entire
freaking life and oh my god you guys
just seriously have to go out by this
like I'm not even kidding this is like a
demand this is like I don't i'm not
giving you guys an option we have to go
and buy this so it looks like this and
obviously mine's kind of dirty but it
has like that really pretty like peachy
look to it so perfect for everyday i
seriously use this product every single
day and before i used it before i
started using it like with my fingers
and I tap it on and I guess it was like
okay or whatever but I realized when you
use a stippling brush like this like I
duo fiber brush and just kind of tap it
in there and then tap on your cheeks it
makes like the prettiest peachy like
cheek look color whatever you want to
call it in the entire world like I
cannot even like explain my love and
thoughts for this blush you just have to
go out and try it for yourself because
it is my favorite I love it so much so
go on by this you can get at Walgreens
or anywhere else but this is like my
life my love so go buy that so then also
recently I've been loving my urban decay
naked palette and this palette is pretty
popular so I'm sure you guys know how it
looks but I don't know if you just heard
that but that was my minor
okay anyways so it looks like this goes
to Mike late to darken the colors are so
pretty i'm definitely going to make like
an eye makeup tutorial revolving all
around this palette you know for like
school and stuff like that and my bangs
are really going because I got them cut
and they're really short sorry but this
is really really really pretty so
definitely buy this too it's like 40
bucks which is kind of expensive but it
is so worth it like I can't even explain
like you just need to go on by this do
so nuff said it's actually the last
booty product that i want to show you
guys is the browse at gogo palette
thingamajigger for your eyebrows from
benefit and you guys saw this in my hall
too but i love this stuff i've been
using it every single freaking day and I
think I'm just gonna keep repurchasing
it because i love how am I like eyebrows
look with this so it looks like this it
has like the gel part here and like two
powders there and I use the lighter one
and obviously i use a lot of bad okay
and then they have a little eyeliner and
i don't really use and then i also have
a little brush that I use and then
there's like two shades for highlighting
and tweezers and our leaders these
tweezers but i absolutely love love love
love love this product so i think it was
like thirty dollars i'm not really sure
but what's it called i love this stuff
it's so like cute compact and just like
throw in your purse or whatever and it
stays on all day tues so i really like
this and I'm probably just going to keep
buying it and I know that my mom wants
this so I'm like totes gonna buy for her
for like Christmas and yeah so I like
that ok so that is it for the beauty
products so now I'm going to get more
into the non- buttocks and i only have a
couple ok so first one is oh my god
skinny cow heavenly crisp candy bars you
do not understand how good these are I'm
just gonna eat one right now in front of
your guys
so those are so good so I got a box of
like six of them there's two different
kinds i think there's like the dream
cluster which i really want to try that
these are the little heavenly crisp
things and they're kind of like I don't
let me show you guys so they come in
little wrappings like this and it's
great for lunch or whatever now I'm just
going to eat one for you guys so that
you guys can be jealous and just watch
me pick out so this is how it looks and
this one got a little melted but oh my
god our heads out looks
hold on oh so good so um yeah definitely
try these out so freaking good I can't
wait to try the Dreaming clusters and
one bar is only like 110 calories which
is really not that bad so definitely try
this out there so friggin good so looks
like that so the next thing that I want
to show you guys is by glitzy glam key
chain holder thingamabob and I think
this thing is so too i recently got it
off glitzy glam and i purposely made it
to match my little wristlet thing from
victoria secret so looks like this I
just got the black one with the pink
bubblegum I think I'm letter and see
obviously I might also I hang my key
from here too but mikey likes as a
sports team on it so i don't want to
like give away where I live but I just
have a little hook thing and then my
keys on there but I'm covering it and
then I just kind of hook it on there but
this is so cute and it is seriously so
like what's a call it's so like usable I
don't know what's the word but I use
this all the time what I just like my
credit target or by grad to walgreens or
whatever and I don't want to take a
whole purse because maybe I'm just
wearing sweatpants and I don't have a
person that matches like my pajamas so
I'll just put this on my wrist and I
like bike or walk or whatever and it's
seriously the most like Oh what is it

word it's so like handy and perfect and
cute and girly it looks like that he was

yeah okay so the last like product type
of thing that I'm going to show you guys
is the meal liquid water enhancers and
these babies have like zero calories
zero grams of sugar like 0 total fat
like basically zero like everything
which is great and they also kind of
like
give like a you know flavored like a
color to your water and these are I've
tried three flavors I've tried these two
and then I also tried the red one which
i think is like what's it called it's
like fruit punch which is actually
pretty good too but these are so good
okay so this one is berry pomegranate
looks like that and it's purple you just
take it open up squeeze in your water
bottle shake it up whatever and this is
the other flavor that half which is
mango peach which tastes like ice-t like
mango SC and this is for suresies my
favorite favorite flavor so definitely
