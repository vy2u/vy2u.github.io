today I'm going to be filming at my
first two back to school video for this
year which makes me really sad to say
that because it's reminding me how fast
this summer flew by I seriously feel
like summer gets shorter and shorter
every single year but it's all good
because I have no good thing to say
earlier this morning I asked you guys to
tweet me any back-to-school questions
that you had with the hashtag ask
Claudia by the way if you're not
following me on Twitter my username is
at Claudius Liske
if you want to follow me but anyways I
feel like most of these kind of have to
do with high school and that's kind of
usually what people are nervous about so
I'm really excited to answer these and
hopefully they help you out a little bit
the first question asks how do you deal
with classes you are having trouble in I
feel like the first thing that a lot of
people mess up on is being afraid to ask
for help because that is not a bad thing
at all my advice to you would be to
create and establish a really good
relationship with your teacher because
if you show to your teacher that you
care about you know getting a good grade
and focusing in class and doing the best
that you can they will genuinely want
you to succeed in their class best
concealer to hide dark circles this
thing right here I have been using the
Maybelline age rewind brightening
concealer for probably two to three
years now and I am still completely
obsessed with it the next question asks
do you have any freshman advice and I
would have to say to not be afraid but
be excited because you are going to be
creating so many memories and learning a
lot of things throughout your four years
in high school I feel like as long as
you participate in the things that
actually interest you you'll be able to
find the friends that were meant for you
and you're just gonna be able to get
along with really well definitely go
into freshman year with open arms and
optimistic and open mindset because if
you shut yourself out from certain
things then you'll never be able to
discover that part of you or meet people
that you would have never met before
just be excited it's gonna be a fun time
I promise what is your favorite subject
I was always really into any type of
science class because I loved learning
about our earth and nature and all of
that it just really interests me and I
also really liked her class just because
I loved to paint and draw on clay and
all that do you have any studying advice
I'm gonna say what everyone says which
is study in advance and give yourself
time to give you guys a better
understanding think of your brain as
like a seed that you're trying to grow
for this test that sounds really strange
but just you're more likely to help that
seed grow and flourish and all that
stuff by watering it every single day
for a long amount of time versus
drowning it in water the night before
you want it to grow basically what I'm
trying to say is it is so much easier
for your brain to take in information
and memorize it when you put it into
smaller portions and you spread it out
because when you're dumping all of these
facts and all this info into your head
the night before a test of course you're
not gonna memorize it as well as you
would if you spread it out and it really
just comes down to self discipline and
knowing that you are going to do so much
better if you actually start studying in
advance where are you athletic in high
school and if yes then which sports now
I wouldn't say I was the most athletic
active girl growing up but I did play
tennis on my high school's tennis team I
really really enjoyed it I met a lot of
people through it it was a great form of
exercise and it was really fun
definitely try out for any sports that
you're interested in what do you love
about school so my favorite part about
school is definitely the social aspect
and I realize this more once I moved out
to
and I stopped going to public school
basically where I'm going with this is
that when you're in school you're
surrounded by a lot of people your age
that might not necessarily be in your
smaller friend group but your
acquaintances with everyone everyone
knows each other that was kind of one of
the things that I loved about high
school because I was very very you know
social and kind of out there in all of
my classes so whether you are in my
friend group or I just met you it didn't
matter I talked to you pretty much the
entire class I realized when I stopped
going to public school those social
interactions didn't really happen in my
life anymore because I'm out here in LA
and I'm pretty much seeing the same
people all the time unless we go out
somewhere or there's an event or a party
or something where it's a little bit
bigger but for the most part you're
pretty much seeing the same people every
single day so I definitely missed that
aspect of my high school life but that
would have to be my favorite how can I
feel motivated to do work this is
definitely one of the hardest things to
do throughout high school because you
have so many distractions going all
around you whether it's boys friends
girls whatever drama I think my best
piece of advice would be to imagine what
you will feel like once you finish all
of your work so let's say you're coming
home from school you know you have a lot
of homework automatically if you sit
down and you think about how you're
going to feel when you finish it because
you know that once you finish things in
advance you're gonna feel amazing
afterwards you're gonna feel on top of
the world if you finished everything
you're on top of your game and you
literally have the opportunity to do
that every single day no one is standing
there stopping you saying no you can't
do your work right now and you gotta
save it till midnight what I'm trying to
say is that your work ethic is what you
make it you are in control of it and you
have to remind yourself that the next
question
wanted to answer was heading deal with
dorama I really really don't understand
drama because I probably had the least
drama out of like anyone I knew I never
had boy drama I never got into fights
with girls I guess the reason why it was
because I always stayed out of it I feel
like whatever friend group you're in
also ties into this because if you find
yourself stuck in a bunch of drama with
your friends where they constantly talk
bad about each other behind each other's
backs
then maybe you just need to sit back and
realize that these might not be the
people that you should be friends with
because if they make you feel kind of on
your toes whenever you're around them or
like you can't say what's on your mind
or if you get nervous around them then
those are dead giveaways that those
people do not need to be in your life
you should be surrounded by people that
make you feel the best version of
yourself that make you feel happy and
truly support whatever you're into and
what you're interested in and all that
stuff I think once you find those people
you will realize how dumb and just
pointless drama is you don't need to
have it in your life it's like so much
better when you don't have it so my last
question for today's video is from your
experience with school what is the most
important thing that you have learned
and I thought this is a really good
question so I wanted to leave it at the
end whatever you're going through right
now whatever seems like the biggest deal
ever you will later realize that that
issue that seems so big is such a small
part of your life that you might
actually eventually just forget about it
your life is so long and you're gonna go
through so many phases and chapters and
high school is like this small compared
to your entire life you've got like
elementary school middle school high
school and then you got college and your
career and the family that you're gonna
build and the family that they're gonna
build and I think what I'm trying to say
is don't make a big deal out of the
things that you're going through right
now because at the end of the day
it's not gonna affect you in the long
run and if anything it's gonna stop you
from creating really good memories that
will help you grow as a person and you
will remember when you're older so all I
would say to not take things too
seriously just focus on your studies but
at the same time just have fun and
create really awesome memories because
high school is gonna be a really fun
part of your life if you let it be a fun
part so that's kind of a nutshell of my
advice for you guys about school I
really hope that I was able to help out
at least a few of you guys with today's
video and I love you guys so much and I
will talk to you later bye hey guys so
today's video is going to be my summer
morning routine so I'll be showing you
guys what I do from when I wake up to
when I leave the house so I normally
naturally wake up at around 9 a.m. and
the first</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
