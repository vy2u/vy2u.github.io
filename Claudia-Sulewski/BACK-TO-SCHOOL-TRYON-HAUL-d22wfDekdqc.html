you would think that I was double
fisting this grantee is just
coincidentally very very close to my
reach oh my god nope we are triple
fisting right here I swear this caffeine
addiction only just recently began it's
not a concern yet hey guys welcome back
to my channel so today's video is going
to be a back to school haul Claudia are
you going back to school no but that
doesn't mean that I can't go shopping
the point of this video is to give you
guys a little inspiration on maybe what
you want to have in your back-to-school
wardrobe things like that let's get into
it I guess I should start with Topshop
I'm gonna get the two accessories out of
the way and then go into the clothes but
I just got two pairs of earrings the
first are really cool because they have
those like back parts to them that flips
out onto the front and you look like
you're wearing some really cool
intricate earring you guys know what I'm
talking about and then also I wanted to
try these little ear cuff things I'm
excited it's just a nice little line of
diamonds very fancy
mama-mama I can't talk I'm filming a
video I didn't get too many clothes at
Topshop but the first two things that I
got are actually the same thing but in
different colors they are both denim
jackets and I love the fit of these
they're cropped they're a little more
fitted not very baggy boyfriend looking
so I think these would be great for
back-to-school the first one is just
your classic medium blue denim jacket
very cute it's got some distress on it
which is great and the next one I got is
just black which I have been looking for
a black denim jacket for such a long
time I wanted to find the perfect fit so
I'm so so happy with this jacket and I
can't wait to wear this around swinter
time because it does not get cold out
here your time will come soon jacket
next up I got this black little v-neck
tank top this my
be very school appropriate but it's
great for layering if you want to wear
it under kind of flowy shirts like I'm
doing with this lace bra and yeah I just
needed one of these then lastly I just
got this super simple dark gray hoodie
I love being comfortable in class so
this would definitely be an essential
for me for back-to-school next up I went
to adidas I quickly want to point out
how cute this bag is I feel like to the
normal eye this wouldn't be a very cute
bag because it's so simple but this my
eyes attract to this kind of stuff like
I want to display this in my room I'm
weird so I've got one thing from there
but I got these little one strap sandals
these are great for pretty much anyone
who likes to be comfy and just slip on
some sandals I already started wearing
them and I literally bought them
yesterday so I'm really happy about
those and then also I got one thing from
American Apparel these are just their
classic high-waisted shorts I wanted to
include these in the hall because the
cut of these although they're so short
they're definitely a little more modest
as far as high-waisted shorts go because
usually they're very cheeky and your
butt is pretty much hanging out but
these kind of have like that extra
right here that gives you more coverage
and stuff and it makes it a little more
tasteful they're wonderful yeah
I just went to like guy mode yeah
American pearl yeah oh my gosh it's
scary how deep my voice can go
that's not even Jesus hello my name is
Claudio hello my name is Claudio that is
scary I'm never doing that again
to tie in with the casual comfortable I
don't really care what I'm wearing by
that we have
going on here I got one thing from
champs which I might possibly be a men's
only store honestly that's the only
portion of the store that I care about
so I could be wrong I've been buying
sweatpants from chance for a few years
now because I love men's sweatpants so
much they are warmer more comfortable
they usually end up being cuter which
doesn't make any sense but it's just a
fact so I got these Nike sweatpants
they're like a nice light gray and they
go tighter on the bottom which I've been
really digging lately and I just really
like the stitching of it it's kind of
got like a drop crotch to it which makes
it look a little manly but these are
gonna be great if I am running around at
night I'm going to Ralph's or really
anywhere that sells food um
side note this zipper pocket right here
is huge when Jo and I saw these at the
storage it was like literally you could
fit your macbook in there it takes up
the entire thigh it's great if I want to
use my iPad as my cellphone for the day
these are the pants to wear it with I've
got two things that I wanted to show you
guys from Free People once again very
casual very comfy let's keep rolling
with it the first water looks like this
and I am so obsessed with this the
material is so stretchy and just
high-quality feeling you just feel so
soft and awesome inside of it those were
awful ways of describing this but yeah
it's really cute it's like a little
cropped hoodie this honestly is my
favorite hoodie in my closet right now
and I think it will be for a very long
time the second one is a more casual
long-sleeve shirt sweater type of thing
Free People sells a bunch of these and I
just love them they're super great with
leggings or you can even wear them over
top of like cut-off denim shorts next up
I of course had to stop by brandy
Melville
as brandy just has the most comfortable
clothes as far as comfortable clothes
what am I saying
I got a few things so let's let's knock
it out the first is this little grey hat
I thought it was cute I don't want to
put it on right now because it's gonna
ruin this thing love their hats they fit
really great I also got these little
frilly pj shorts I have a bunch of these
but I didn't have this color so you know
decided to add to the collection next up
I got some tank tops so once again these
are great for layering or if you live
someone with a hotter climate I got this
little muted army green v-neck top I
love this color so much right now and
yeah that's all I have to say about that
the next tank has a little striped
pattern on it I thought the cut of it
was really cute very feminine and simple
looking next up we've got this kind of
cropped PJ shirt type of thing I don't
know I really really like the cut of
their short sleeve shirts it's a nice
baby blue and it makes me feel like I'm
in eighth grade and the last thing that
I got from brandy are these baggy
boyfriend jeans I am so excited about
them these should not belong in this
hall because they are definitely not
school appropriate because of one reason
this is what the front looks like
they're just super light wash they've
got rips on the knees but the best part
and the non-school appropriate part of
these pants is the butt cut right here
it doesn't actually show your butt but
it's right beneath it and I am so
obsessed with this little trend thing
going on here I've seen a few stores do
before and I've been looking for the
perfect pair but it's like the perfect
amount of like whoo I'm a little edgy
and sexual but I'm also still kind of
you know classy about it because you're
not showing your actual butt so you see
me wearing these that's the kind of mood
I'm in in that day so the last store
that I went to was Nasty Gal my favorite
store in the entire world this is
getting really weird really fast I just
got to at different shirts so the first
one I
I'm really excited about because it's
this super soft and kind of flowy gray
shirts but I really like how open the
neckline is so I would definitely wear
it with like a bra like this or maybe
one of the tank tops that I showed you
guys yeah I got that and then the last
and final thing that I will be showing
you guys is something that I'm not
really sure about I don't know how much
I love it or how much I am confused
about it
so obviously dead giveaway to just buy
it right it is a turtleneck shirt I not
in a million years would ever think that
I would buy my own turtleneck shirt
because I used to think that they made
my face look chubby and that they were
just really unattractive but I saw this
kind of cranberry burgundy colored shirt
it's got no sleeves which is cool and
then it's got a really long turtleneck
if you wear a turtleneck school you can
just cover your face and shut everyone
out if you're not having fun escape a
little bit yeah in all seriousness I am
excited to try this out because it will
definitely be interesting for me to
incorporate into my looks so I'm very
excited about it so that is everything
for my back to school haul I hope you
