on the set of the commute we are
currently getting ready for shooting day
we're just so sad because it's over
my character is Emma she's got a little
bit of to to her if you stole my car I
swear to god I'll destroy you throughout
the series she definitely starts to open
up just for mine and her emotions and
she really grows as a character Emma's
key piece that she wears in every
episode is her blue corded choker and
necklace which I would 100% wear week
one of shooting the commute was my body
was not ready for that so I was really
sick coming into this the first two days
I sounded like a man I had no voice I
left Greta at Van Nuys Holmes SAT
forever we just had to roll with it
making a part of them with character
then I end up getting pink eye we think
I don't know but good bye being the last
week
super irritated the fingers my favorite
seem to change is at the school super
high platform which I later had to jump
off of at the edge of the team and it
was so scary I was doing like three
times and it's super fun thank you guys
for listening to all of my steps my
stories I'm super super excited to come
out
okay
