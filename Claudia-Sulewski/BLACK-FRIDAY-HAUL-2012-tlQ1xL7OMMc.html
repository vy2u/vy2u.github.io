apologize for my parents because the
lighting isn't very good right now
because I'm just using my two lamps from
my room and it is 11:40 p.m. right now
so I'm I'm a little bit tired and my
face and makeup and hair is just it's
not looking so hot right now but I
really wanted to film my Black Friday
haul for you guys because I just want to
put everything in my closet and just
enjoy it and look at it and just I don't
know I'm where I did want to mention
that my family like never goes Black
Friday shopping I don't know why so I
didn't go shopping at like 12:00 a.m. or
on Thanksgiving I know that a lot of
stores opened up like last night at
around 10 o'clock or something like that
but I didn't do any of that crazy Black
Friday shopping but I did go shopping
with my friend Jonna her mom and her
sister and we started shopping I think
around like 11 o'clock and it's 11:00 so
we've basically been shopping for 12
hours all day today and I'm very excited
about all the deals that I got and just
all the stuff that I got so I'm just I'm
really excited right now also I want to
mention that we did go to a couple
different stores as well as two
different malls so we've basically just
been driving around all day today so I'm
kind of exhausted but yeah so first off
we stopped by Ulta and these weren't
really on sale for anything crazy they
were on sale I forgot how much I paid
for these are still pretty expensive but
I've always wanted to try the crest 3d
white strips because I hate my teeth
they are not very white at all and I
just I really want to start wetting them
so I got the crest 3d white strips and
these are the professional effects one
and the whitening power is four so we
will do a review on these after I use a
couple or something or once I finished
the whole box I don't really know yet
but yeah I'm really excited to try these
out
and that is all that I got from that
sauce the next things that I purchased
were from the first mall that we went to
and I first got some stuff from American
Eagle Outfitters I'm not really sure
what they're Black Friday sale was but
they did have a certain amount of
percentage like taking off your entire
order or something like that I don't
really know but yes so first off I got
these jeans right here and I love these
so much when I try them on it was
literally just it was like heaven so
they look like this I don't know I never
thought I'd ever purchased like floral
jeans but um yeah I'm really excited for
these and they're just jeggings and
they're very very comfortable and they
fit perfectly so I got those and then
the last thing that I got from there
were these leggings right here and I
thought these were cute I love the
feeling of these because they are very
soft and they feel very thick and they
also have like a band at the top which
is also really nice so these seem like
very good quality next we stopped by
ever coming in fish slash Hollister
slash Billy Hicks I don't know they like
combined all the stores but um I just
got these Hollister jeans because I
really like the way that they fit me and
they're very comfortable so I just got
these and these are only like $14 so it
was a total steal they were on sale and
then I also got like a certain amount
discounted for my entire purchase so
this was an awesome deal I spent like
fourteen on these then I went to what
PacSun and I actually got two different
purchases from there from the two
different malls so I'll show you that
later but um at the first ma I just got
these jeans and I've always wanted to
print jeans and I just I don't know why
I never bought them but I finally did
and these were on sale for I think $18
so they were super inexpensive they're a
great deal and yeah I really like the
way that these fit me next up we went to
forever 21 and they were actually having
a lot of deals like I just I don't know
why but I do not think that forever 21
have like Black Friday sales going on
but they did and I don't really remember
them but I just remember that I got a
bunch of stuff this got it so um I got
some leggings and these are just gray
leggings or tights I think ya know
they're tights I also got some fuzzy
socks because I love their fuzzy saxon
you could never get enough of those so
yeah the first clothing item that I got
was this shirt right here and it's like
a chiffon kind of looking in the front
and it has the Eiffel Tower and it's
just so pretty and then it's great on
the back and I just I think this would
be great with just black leggings and
combat boots and just basic very simple
easy outfits then I also got this
flannel shirt right here and I loved the
colors of this shirt I thought it was so
unique and I've never seen a flannel
like this before so it has black and
gray and like teal and purple and yeah
that's pretty much it but this looks so
pretty when you just leave it opened up
with like leggings or something I don't
know and it's actually really thick too
so this was very very nice I also got
this shirt and this shirt was on sale
for only $6 I think on the receipt it
said it was like $3 or something I think
it was like taking an extra 50% off so
this was like a three dollar shirt which
is awesome because it's so cute it's
just a tank with a boob pocket and it
has a really cool tie-dye pattern going
on then I got this shirt which I've
actually been eyeing for a very long
time and I don't know why it's taking me
so long to buy it but I'm I'm literally
so
I bought this shirt so it looks like
this it also has that like chiffon kind
of material look going on like the first
shirt that I showed you guys but it
looks like this it's blue and it has
whatever like water and forests and
mountains and stuff and it's so pretty
it's really long so this will be great
with like ripped leggings and like
combat and that's pretty much why wear
every single day just hugging's but yeah
and that's just white on the back and I
this is like my most favorite piece that
I bought I was like everything today is
very good then I also bought a simple
gray sweater because I feel like you can
never have enough chunky sweaters and
this one's a little bit shorter because
most of mine are very long on the butt
so I can wear them with leggings but
these would be great for any like jeans
that I want to wear or something so very
simple but um it's very thick and very
soft so I was very impressed by that
sweater lastly I just got one necklace
and I don't really know why I bought it
don't know what I'm gonna wear it with
but it was cute and I feel like I need
to buy more necklaces like these because
I don't own any so it has black-ish
diamonds on it and i are they flowers no
they're not they're just different
shapes and I don't know I thought it was
pretty so I think this will go well for
the holiday season and whatnot so we'll
see if how I saw that why am I talking
so weird right now I don't know but that
is everything that I got at 3021 then we
went to a second mall and it was an
outdoor mall and I got some stuff to PEX
on and a boatload of stuff and Pat the
body works of course like no Hall is a
hall without better
so start with that first so first off I
got this small candle in the scent pink
tulip and this was 75% off so I spent
like two something on this I believe
that was an amazing deal so I had to
pick it up then I also bought five hand
sanitizers for five dollars and I always
want to buy these but then I don't I
don't know why because I'm never in the
mood and then I regret it so I finally
purchased five of them so I got them in
the scent sparkling pink champagne which
smells absolutely delicious I also got
vanilla bean and Noelle then I also got
berry twinkle and I got winter candy
apple I love this one
and I also got pink sugarplum I also got
a soap and I believe this one was 50%
off and this is the lemon sunshine slush
antibacterial gentle foaming hand soap
so really happy about that I just got a
few different candles and these are all
50% off which was awesome and I actually
didn't end up buying any three wick
candles I don't really like three whit
candles because I feel like they take
forever to a burn out and I just I I
would rather have the smaller candles in
just a bunch of different scents so I
can switch it up um so I just got a
bunch of those first off I got a candle
in the scent
pineapple mango and it basically just
smells like pineapples and mangoes
smells very good
I'm also got like summer scents because
those were the ones that were on sale
then I also got blackberry grapefruit
this one smells so good they was the
first time that I ever discovered this
scent so I got really excited because
it's not
good next up I got the wild strawberry
candle and it smells like wild
strawberries I just I'm not very good
describing these at all and then the
last one is lemon mint leaf and this one
just smells like lemons actually I can
smell them it now
and then lastly I just got three little
baby candles I thought these were so
cute so I got one in creamy pumpkin and
cinnamon not bread I don't even remember
buying this one but I remember liking
that one so I like her and then also I
got salted caramel so that is everything
that I bought abscessed embodiments so
last but not least I got a couple things
from texana again and they're just two
pairs of jeans the sound that was going
on at PacSun was buy one pair of jeans
and get another free so I definitely
want to take advantage of that first off
I got these black jeans right here and I
don't know if you will be able to tell
on camera but these are not just
ordinary black jeans they're like shiny
they kind of have like that like waxy
finish to them I guess you would call it
so when you wear them they kind of look
like you're wearing leather pants but
not in the same way I don't know it's
kind of hard to describe but these look
so cool on there like leathery and waxy
and shiny and just really cool I don't
know and then the other pair is pretty
basic but I do not own any light washed
ripped jeans that fit me perfectly and
these fit like a frickin charm so I was
so happy when I saw these these fresh
expensive they were like fifty dollars
so I ended up spending fifty dollars at
the store but that's basically like 25
dollars each which is not that bad so um
yeah I got these and they're just like
washed skinny jeans they're ripped but
they
they just they fit so nicely and I just
I had to buy them so that is everything
that I bought for Black Friday I'm very
very happy with all my purchases I wish
I had gone shopping at midnight and that
kind of stuff because I've never done
that before I'm such a newbie at this
but I mean I'm getting there at least I
did some Black Friday shopping during
the day so that is everything that I
bought I hope you guys enjoyed it I will
talk to you guys later and that's it bye
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
