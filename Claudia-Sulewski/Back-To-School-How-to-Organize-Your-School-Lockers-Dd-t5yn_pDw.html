um so love you guys have been asking me
to do the like back-to-school type of
videos on just like fashion and
organization and like notebooks and how
I study and all that stuff um so today
I'm going to be doing one of those
videos and I mean they're going to be
focusing on gym lockers and regular
school lockers and I will be making a
video on how I like about all my folders
and stuff I first have to buy my school
supplies and then I'll make a video
about it so right now I'm just gonna do
this um so first I'm gonna start out
with gym lockers and the lockers that we
have at our middle school because I'm
going to eighth grade I don't know if
all you guys knew that but our gym
lockers are like pretty tiny about that
big okay and you have a lock and you
like pull it down it opens up like this
you throw your stuff in and then you
close it and lock it so it's a really
small place to like keep organized and
we have like gym uniforms and stuff like
that and I remember that during seat
like flip-flops season so it's like fall
on spring I never wear a gym shoes it's
like either I wear Uggs or flip-flops to
school which is really bad for my feet
but I always had I remember I would
always have socks
flying everywhere in my gym locker so I
did figure out a little way to keep your
gym locker organized so I'm just gonna
get go ahead and get started on what you
should keep in your gym locker so of
course the first thing is your gym
uniform if you have one and so I'm not
going to show that because it shows my
school and my name on it so the second
thing is shoes and these are just Nike
Shox
I had these last year too you need of
course deodorant and this is the secret
platinum vanilla chai and if you guys
ever have been to Starbucks this smells
exactly like the start
including private you know it's amazing
and then you also because you know when
you're running and sweating and stuff
you gotta freshen up down there and also
you need body mists and I love body
mists because once you're done writing
and you smell stinky you can just
straight all over you and those are
great and then another thing that I do
recommend which actually I used but I
don't have it with me because we ran out
and then it's Febreze I remember last
year I had four raised in my lil gym
locker and all my friends be like all
you spray me you know and I would spray
like especially our gym shoes oh it's
right with Ray's the gym locker itself
smells so bad the girls gym locker so we
like run around the entire thing and I
just hold on to the thing and it like
spray but um I remember like we used to
do that it smells really funny and of
course like I'll sing for flip flop
season or whatever I never I have to
keep socks in my gym locker so of course
you need socks and of course I get like
you know like the five year old crazy
ones
and I realized a great way to organize
your socks if that makes any sense
because last year they were like all
over the place I don't know which ones
are clean which ones are dirty these
things right here
life savers oh my gosh so basically
these are just like little bags with
like holes in them so they're kind of
like mash or whatever and these are
really great to keep your socks in now
you can choose whether you want to keep
clean socks in here or dirty socks I
think since I'm - I can I can do that
but I think I'm just going to keep one
and I'm just gonna keep dirty socks in
here so I can like close it up and take
it home so that my mom can wash the
socks cuz I don't want to bring socks
home every single day so if you just
kind of keep them in here like your
dirty ones or your clean ones or
whatever it's super great I just think
it's easier way to organize your socks
you guys know what I mean but these are
I think it's a pretty good idea I'm
gonna be doing it so yeah you can only
do much with the gym lockers because
they're so small so now I'm
get on to the main entire Locker so in
middle school where we live the middle
school has the biggest Locker is because
elementary they're like this tiny middle
school they're like this big and there
are stalls me and then in high school
they're like split like half so you get
like a little one top or bottom
and I love decorating my locker it's so
much fun like I had posters and pictures
everywhere so magnets definitely great
make sure to decorate your locker during
the school year because well this site
is like getting all flat okay because
when you have a girly and pretty
environment that equals a happy
environment and that equals a happy
students so that's all right look at it
so first I'm gonna show you guys a
couple of tips and tricks on how to keep
your main locker organized so definitely
number one thing is these things these
are like little Locker shelves or
whatever I actually have two and I tried
using two and it just it's I didn't have
enough in my backpack so basically what
I do is I keep this on the bottom of my
locker and this is really oh my god I
totally recommend you guys doing this so
my books I used to keep on like on top
at the top shelf it was oh my god it was
annoying though because I never had room
for anything else or I would just like
lay them on top like this no definitely
a great thing that I know I'm gonna be
doing like next year is you put this on
the ground and you put your books
underneath it because it's like perfect
spacing and it kept me it's so organized
because I just need that all my books
are down there so I would go down pull
out whatever books I need because you
can see the side so you know what books
you want to grab and just shove them in
there so that's like your little book
area like damage or death here and then
on top I would like whatever drop my
backpack or whatever so definitely love
this book
shelves and Reina notebooks another
great thing that I love is this thing
this is like my ultimate locker station
area you know so of course you have the
mirror very important you know beyond
beauty start out look at yourself during
the day and this seems super great I
have no idea where I got this I'm sorry
you could probably get them at Target
the great thing is it has a bunch of
pockets so down here of course you need
some kind of chapstick some kind of lip
gloss and a teeny little some kind of
fragrance you know then I've got these
pockets so I've got headbands in here
for those days or just kind of put my
hair in a bun and like some bobby pins
making like see I've got regular hair
ties here and mini ones here and I've
got a mirror here and I've got two clips
I just got to clip my hair back for days
where it's like blah and then also
what's great is there was like this
little pocket right here and um I just
keep a comb in here so that's great I
don't really keep school supplies in my
locker unless it's a coloring stuff or
whatever because I carry around like a
huge I carried this thing around for my
pencil as my pencil case and I just kind
of keep everything in there so I'm
mainly just kind of have this station
area for like my hair and my face and
stuff so this is super great I love this
thing and what's great bot is it has
like a little hook thing but also it's
magnetic
right here so I stick this onto my door
so when I open up it's like oh hello
Claudia you know another thing is I know
a lot of girls have like whiteboards I
used to be one of those girls and I
thought that you know every day I like
write them a little like to-do list and
stuff but everyone sees it and you don't
only have time to doodle in your locker
during passing period time because we
have a pretty short passing period time
and everyone's talent you know so I
don't really think I think whiteboards
by the end of the year all my whiteboard
we'll be saying is like I love Elise
this is high or like Hadron I was here
you know I mean I guess it's you can
like girl if I your locker like that but
I don't don't try like writing in it
every single day because you're not
gonna have the time to do that but
another couple things that are great for
like storage areas I mean I'm not
storage like ways to store things in
your locker is this thing right here
super great you keep your girl
essentials here if you guys know what
I'm saying
and then you can keep like makeup in
here whatever if you're one of those
girls that likes to wear makeup to
school then you like the fresh another
one we could just take this thing to the
bathroom because if you have a period
perfect makeup perfect freshen up during
you know like in the bathroom whatever
just take this entire thing that's
perfect and also another thing that's
great for organizing is the same guy
Lancome and it just has a little Hough
so you can hook it on it's got like a
little mast right here and and our hair
this could keep school supplies or
makeup or whatever you want it zips up
it's great and all oh my god this is
gonna be way too long in the video so
I'm gonna see this later conf love you
have anything else that I missed I'm so
sorry but I have to do this under a
minute I'm gonna do video on my vlog
channel and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
