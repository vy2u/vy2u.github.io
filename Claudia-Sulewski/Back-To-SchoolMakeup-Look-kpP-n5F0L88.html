be featuring the August glam bag from
Ipsy so I'm gonna start out by grabbing
at the Michael Todd jojoba charcoal
gentle exfoliating facial scrub and this
scrub just helps to remove dead skin
cells impurities and toxins so I'm just
going to rub this in a circular motion
on my face and I know it looks a little
bit ridiculous I'm fully aware um but it
makes your skin feel very soft after
that I'm applying on my Noah natural
vanilla lip balm which is lightweight
but moisturizing at the same time and my
lips really need it right now because
they are very sunburned after that I'm
describing my benefit stay don't stray
and just applying it to my under eye
circles as well as my lids just to
cancel out any discoloration and then
I'm going to go in with a BB cream this
is the Pacifica alights multi mineral BB
cream which Prime's
hydrates and perfects all in the one and
although it is very lightweight it still
gives you a really nice coverage so I'm
just applying that on with a Beauty
Blender
after that I'm just going to grab my
favorite concealer which is from amazing
cosmetics
and I'm just going to cover up any
imperfections or acne that I have right
now because I've really been breaking
out and lastly for the face I'm just
going to grab my makeup forever powder
as well as my hoola bronzer and just
apply that onto my face like I normally
do now starting off with the eye shadow
I'm going to be using my Urban Decay
Naked palette and first using the shade
half-baked I'm going to lightly dust
this all over my lid after that I'm
gonna grab smog and just apply this into
my crease to deepen up the look and I'm
also going to apply this on my lower
lash line to kind of help even out the
eye makeup look now grabbing my mica
beauty a mineral eyeshadow in the shade
of bronze from my Ipsy glam bag I'm
going to apply this on the outer half of
my eyelids to kind of help warm up the
look since it does have that kind of
bronze reflex to it
lastly I'm just going to highlight my
upper brow bone with a lighter eyeshadow
now for eyeliner I'm going to be using a
liquid brown liner to keep it a little
bit more natural looking and I'm just
going to create a small wing for mascara
I'm using my pixie lash booster mascara
in blackest black and I'm just going to
apply this on my lower and upper lashes
for blush I'm using the city color cheek
stain in the shape pink and this just
adds the perfect flush for a
long-lasting and natural glow so I'm
just dotting that onto my cheeks and
blending it away last but not least I'm
using my NYX butter gloss in the shade
Eclair and I'm just going to apply this
all over my lips that is it for today's
video I hope you guys enjoyed it and
leave requests down below on what type
of back to school videos you guys would
like to see from me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
