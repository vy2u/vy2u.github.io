doing a back to school makeup haul and
I'm so excited for this because I have
so much stuff to show you guys but I
want to mention two things before I
start off number one
I got everything shown in this video
from two different websites everything
was bought online so I used eyes lips
face calm and I also bought from Ulta
calm and then the second thing that I
want to mention is I bought everything
with my own money I didn't get anything
for free I didn't use my mama's money I
didn't use my dad's money this is all
like things that I bought with my own
money so I just want to say that before
you guys think oh my god your parents
wallet because no I paid for all this my
parents would never pay for all this um
so I'm just going to get right into it
first I'm gonna start with the elf
products and I'm gonna have the links to
both their websites down in the downbar
um see goings just whatever check them
out and I got seven things from ELF so
let's just start it right away
so the first thing I got was a tinted
moisturizer with SPF in Africa beige and
it looks like that I started talking
about plus it's like $1 like come on you
know um
then I also got their shimmering facial
whip in lilac petal so this is kind of
like a highlighter type of thing so I
like that
but I also got one of their plumping lip
glazes and this is in babydoll and you
will see that some of the things that
show in this video is already opened up
just because I already want to try them
cuz I got all this stuff yesterday
so obviously this one was opened but
this isn't babies all and the clear one
feels so good on your lips it's all
tingly and stuff like that it also I got
one lipstick and let me tell you guys I
use this yesterday and this is probably
by far my favorite new lipstick in the
entire an entire freaking world and this
is their I think it's the mineral line
I'm really sure it was $5 this is in
natural nymph
and it is seriously the prettiest like
nude lipstick in the entire world it's
so opaque and
but let me swatch it for you guys not
gonna be able to see it really because
this lighting sucks it's right there
then also I got their wet gloss lash and
overall clear mascara I really just
wanted this for my eyebrows then I also
got their regular and waterproof mascara
duo just want to try it out it's like
double sided so I like that okay now the
last thing that I got from ELF was their
contouring blush and a bronzing powder
super cute first of all has a huge
mirror but then it just has a bronzer
and a blush and it's so pretty I just
love it and that's basically it that I
got for the what's it called
Ofcom so now I'm going to show you guys
what I got from Ulta and yeah that's
basically it okay so first I'm gonna
start up with the little samples I got
like three samples but I mean I don't
really think it matters not that so the
first thing that I got was the Urban
Decay Naked palette oh my gosh I've been
wanting this for so long and I finally
got it basically everybody knows how
this thing looks just looks like that
it's expensive too I was pretty
surprised but love this oh my gosh so
excited about that so then I got a
shampoo and conditioner because I was
running out and these are the john
frieda sheer blondes color renew tone
correcting shampoo and conditioner
number one it's purple my favorite color
and I needed a purple shampoo to kind of
tone down the blond highlights cuz I
just dyed my hair for the second time
like three days ago and I just heard
really good things about these so I got
them and they're really great I used
them this morning so I like that then I
also got the benefit brows of gogo
palettes just because you guys know that
I fill in my eyebrows because I really
like so I really want to try out
different things and I absolutely love
this I used it this morning it looks
like that it comes with basically
everything and I think it's so cute and
compact and little and I love it and
that's from benefit also I got the
benefit Benetint which I've been wanting
seriously for like two years now or
something and it just looks like this
it's like a lip and cheek stain you guys
all know about this but
so excited for that so that I got one
more thing from benefit and it's there
mister fighting mr. bright kit and I
definitely recommend getting this it's
like thirty six dollars and everything
in here is like seriously worth so much
more okay anyways well looks like this
when you open it on
okay well it looks like this when you
open it up and it has Girl Meets pearl
which I absolutely love they have the
posy tint which is also like a lip and
cheek stain they have high beam which is
like a highlighter and then they also
have erased paste concealer which I've
wanted for so long and it only comes in
medium so if you're light-skinned or
dark skin then this isn't really for you
but they have a medium consider that
comes with it and I absolutely adore
this I just love it so so so much so
looks like that then also I just got one
of these little blending sponges because
I've never tried them out and I'm really
excited to try it out so it was like
five dollars I got that then also I got
the car girl lash blast volume
waterproof mascara I've seen so many
people use this stuff so I finally
decide to buy myself and I'm so excited
back then I got three different
lipsticks the first one is from Rimmel
London and I absolutely love this
packaging because it's purple and I got
this in coral shimmer which looks like
that let me swatch it for you guys so
there's a swatch of it and as you can
see it's the darker one it's just a
really pretty shimmery coral I didn't I
don't really own any girl lipsticks so
that's why I decide to buy it so love
them then I got two Revlon lipsticks and
these are the color burst ones so the
first one is in petal which is a very
pretty like medium pink it's kind of
like a nudey pink I thought it was just
so cute it's great for just like a very
natural-looking lip and you can't really
see it because once again this lighting
sucks but it's right there and the other
one is from not from but it's in pink
sugar which is like a baby pink because
you guys know how much I love nude lips
so looks like that and this is actually
really sheer because I tried it out so
it's kind of disappointing on how sheer
it was it's actually right there but you
really can't see it because it's so
sharing so light but actually gives a
really nice kind of
like light tents here to your lips so I
like that then I got three cream blushes
because I've never actually tried clean
cream blushes before this so the first
one is from Maybelline and it's the
'true mousse blush and this is in rose
petal so it looks like this got a swatch
of it you can't even see it but it's
right there you can't even see it
it's actually really sure though I was
kind of surprised right and also I got
one of the NYX cream blushes and this is
in glow and this one is seriously so
pigmented it's like a hot pink it's so
pigmented honestly a little goes a long
way with this stuff the last blush I got
is one from covergirl and it's a funny
story about this I was actually stalking
Lauren Conrad because I don't think ice
know this but she's like my number one
role model and I'm just obsessed with
her and basically she made a post
answering questions and one time she
mentioned that this is like her favorite
everyday blush that she wears all the
time so of course I had to go out and
buy it myself and this is the covergirl
and Olay simply simply ageless sculpting
blush and this is in I think plush peach
and it's really cool because the top
spins off but then also the top of it
opens up with a little sponge like that
and then the actual product is like a
twisty offi and obviously I've used it
but it's so cute let me just show you
guys it so it's right there you can kind
of see it yeah it's just the perfect
like plush not plush but um the perfect
like peachy kind of blush so I really
like this it looks like that so then I
got one of the NYX is ultra coral mania
and these are just like little loose
eyeshadows and it was really really
cheap so looks like that just a very
pretty shimmery nude eyeshadow then I
got two more
and that's basically it so I got two NYX
jumbo eye shadow pencils because you
guys know I love these so the first one
I got is in yogurt it's a good all over
like the lid everyday type of face which
looks like that I kind of want to make
it big so you guys can see it but it
looks like that it's just a very
shimmery kind of pinky champagne color
so it looks like that then the second
one I got was an iced mocha and this was
just a very pretty kind of medium dark
brown so looks like that there you go so
that is basically it for my haul I hope
you guys enjoyed it and it kind of helps
you on maybe some things that you want
to buy for back-to-school but I really
love all these products and I'm just so
excited to put them in my makeup cart
right now and just kind of organize
everything um well that's basically it
for today's video and I'll talk to you
guys later
