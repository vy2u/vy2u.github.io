doing a back-to-school neutral eye
makeup look and I don't really have
anything else to say about it I'm just
gonna clip my hair back and well there's
like baby hairs flying everywhere
and sorry you guys have to be stuck with
this quality for a while but yeah let's
just get right into the tutorial so the
first thing you want to do is prime your
eyelids and I'm going to be using Nyx's
jumbo eye shadow pencil in milk and you
just want to apply this all over your
entire lid so you can go ahead and just
like dot around and make sure you blend
it out with your finger afterwards just
like that so now I'm gonna grab the
Coastal Scents 88 warm palette I love
this talent I love just like creating a
bunch of neutral looks with this palette
and just experimenting with it because
it comes all these gorgeous colors and I
totally recommend you guys to get this
so I'm gonna grab the Sigma SS 239 brush
which is just a flat shader brush and
I'm going to choose this color right
here it's just a light whoops it's just
a light skin color and I'm gonna pet
this all over my eyelid oh my god you
really cannot tell in this video I'm
sorry this quality is so bad
so now I'm going to choose this shade
right here in the top corner and this is
a little bit darker so this is just
gonna darken up the look just a little
bit so we're gonna take the same zyk
brush just get it in remember to always
tap off any excess and I'm gonna apply
this into the crease just to lightly
like deepen up the look inside the
crease I'm sorry you guys really can't
see like anything in this so I'm just
kind of applying it into the crease and
just bringing it down okay so I love
putting a dark like chocolatey brown in
the crease and bringing it up so I'm
gonna grab this Coastal Scents brush and
this is just their pink what is it
called this is just a crease brush so
I'm going to choose this dark brown
right here it's the third to the bottom
this one right here so I'm just gonna
tap that in there because this brush
really does pick up a lot and we're
gonna start putting that into the crease
and it's gonna look crazy at first I
promise you guys it's gonna look crazy
and you guys are gonna think that I'm
like a crazy person but when you blend
it all out it all like goes together and
it looks normal so
see it looks really dark this camera
isn't picking it up that much so I kind
of had to put more than usual just so
that you guys can sort of see somewhat
of the look but it kind of does look
crazy like okay so I'm done and you
don't even have to worry if they're not
perfectly even that's okay because now
we are going to choose the SS 224 brush
and this is just a big fluffy brush and
go ahead and first blend it all out in
the crease and then I'm just gonna
roughly blend it around the edges just
softening there look see how it already
just faded immediately like that
okay so that's how it's gonna end up
looking and all right you can't really
see it in this camera okay well anyways
um then next I'm going to choose any
highlight color for the brow bone and
the inner corner so really it doesn't
really matter what you choose I'm going
to go ahead and choose this one right
here it looks like it's white in the
camera but it's like a shimmery skin
tone but it's like a little light so I'm
gonna choose the SS to 7d whoops sorry
can't read this
275 brush and this is just an angled
brush tap that in there tap off the
excess and go ahead and just Pat that
right underneath your brow bone and then
you can just bring it down I'm gonna go
ahead and grab that big fluffy brush and
just blend these two together once again
Oh forgot to tip off exes that's why I
look so crazy it's okay I'll blend it
out just like that so now I'm going to
bring in that same color into my inner
corner and to do that job I'm going to
choose the SS 219 brush and this is just
like a really small pointed um brush and
I go ahead and just place it right in
the tear duct and you can even bring it
underneath to your lower lash line and
then bring it up just kind of fade it
out
okay so that is it for the eyeshadow so
that's how it's gonna look and now we're
gonna go ahead and do the eyeliner and
all I'm gonna do is just put a little
bit of gel eyeliner on my upper lash
line so I'm going to choose this Sigma
flat angled brush and this is actually
composed $0.02 I'm sorry and the Coastal
Scents gel liner a matte true black and
I'm just gonna lightly apply it onto my
upper lash line and sorry if it doesn't
turn out perfect I have like this really
small mirror and I can't really see what
I'm doing okay now I'm gonna go ahead
and curl my lashes and apply on my
favorite mascara and I'm just gonna be
using leg combs to finish seals high
definition mascara and just coat that
onto your upper lashes so after that you
can just apply on your favorite lip
gloss or lipstick or lip balm or
whatever and on my face all wearing as
bronzer and blush and that is it for
today's tutorial so that's how it looks
sorry the quality is so bad I really
wish my camera worked I'm gonna try to
get fixed as soon as possible so that's
it for today's video and I hope you guys
enjoy it enjoyed it so yeah I'll see you
guys tomorrow this video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
