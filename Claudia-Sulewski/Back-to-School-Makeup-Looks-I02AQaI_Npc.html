in a week I decide to make five I make
up looks and all of these looks are very
neutral and they're easy to do and
they're very very fast so they're great
to do before school
the main product that I'm going to be
featuring in today's video is this BH
Cosmetics eyeshadow palette and I really
like this palette because it has two
kind of levels to it so let me show you
guys it so you've got the first one I'm
just going to put it right on top so the
one on top fits right over the other one
and these colors are a little bit more
funkier and brighter and kind of bolder
and then you've got more kind of like
neutral and kind of colder colors on the
bottom and I'm going to be using this
palette for this entire video just
because I don't want to jump around
using different you know Mac products or
randomly at anna Stila eyeshadow because
it's kind of hard for everybody just
kind of to have the exact products that
I use so basically I'm just going to
feature every look and have it all
revolving around this one palette
because it's very inexpensive so
everyone can definitely afford it and
you can create the same necklace that I
have and you don't have to go and buy a
bunch of products from different
companies because I want to make you
know one look so I really love beach
cosmetics definitely check them out I'll
have the link so you know their website
the downbar and stuff like that so I'm
going to be revolving every single you
know look with this palette so yeah I'm
just going to get right into it these
are going to be really easy and really
neutral and that's up totally just drop
something you guys know that I drop
everything in all my videos so yeah I
keep on watching if you want to see what
tutorials I have for you guys
you
so first we want to start out by priming
your eyes I'm using Urban Decay's
eyeshadow primer potion and I'm just
blending that out with my fingers so
then you want to grab any eyeshadow that
matches your skin tone because you
really want this look to be natural so
we're just going to apply this all over
the lids now we're going to need a
darker eye shadow for the crease I'm
using this one and it's kind of like a
chestnut II like bronzy brown and I
really like how it looks on your eyelids
so I'm going to choose that with a big
fluffy brush and I'm just going to apply
this into the crease I really like this
eyeshadow because they'll help deepen up
your eyes and add more attention to them
and that's basically it for the
eyeshadow I told you guys this is going
to be really easy so now grab any white
eyeliner I chose one from Sephora
and you're just going to line your
waterline then grab a smaller brush and
any white eyeshadow and you're just
going to Pat that right over the
eyeliner so that it sets and stays for
the rest of the day you're also going to
bring it into your inner tear ducts just
to brighten up the eyes so of course now
you want to curl your lashes and apply
on your favorite mascara I'm using
falsies by Maybelline
once you're done with that that's
basically it so I really love this eye
makeup look because it's super natural
and makes your eyes a little bit bigger
and more awake
so now you're going to start out by
priming your eyes of course but this
time I'm going to get the lids and also
the lower lash line so now I'm going to
grab this peachy skin toned eyeshadow
and I'm going to apply this all over my
lids as the base so I'm just going to
Pat that right on there so now I'm going
to grab this bright orange eyeshadow
with a big fluffy brush and I'm going to
apply this into the crease do not add
too much because this is the background
color for the main crease color so I'm
just going to blend it out and make sure
that this is very soft
then with a crease brush I'm going to
choose this bright pinky red eye shadow
and I'm just going to apply this into
the crease this is going to deepen up
the look and make it look a little bit
more fierce then of course with a bigger
brush you want to blend everything out
so now I'm going to choose the same
exact eyeshadow use before except with
an angled brush and I'm just going to
line my lower lash line then I'm going
to grab some black eyeliner by my
waterline and I'm also going to lie on
my tight line so of course
curl your lashes and apply on your
favorite mascara
and now you're done I really love this
look because it's very warm but fierce
at the same time because of the red
eyeshadow
you
once you're done priming your eyes grab
any medium brown eyeshadow and just
apply that all over your lids
so now I'm going to choose this shimmery
chocolatey Brown type of eyeshadow and
I'm just going to apply this into the
crease now this is the point where you
can add more or less and I decided to
add a lot of it to have a dramatic
effect so now I'm going to grab an
angled brush and any white eyeshadow and
I'm just going to very softly highlight
my upper brow bone and then grabbing my
favorite black eyeliner I'm just going
to line the outer half of my waterline I
also chose to line the outer half of my
tight line and then you guys know the
drill
curl your lashes and apply on your
favorite mascara and that's basically it
I love this look because it's a little
bit more dramatic but obviously you can
see that it was really really fast to
make and very very simple
you
so now for this look I'm not going to be
using any eyeshadow but I'm going to be
using a concealer just to cover up the
veins so I used one from my BH Cosmetics
concealer palette and now I'm going to
grab my favorite gel eyeliner and this
one's from Wet n Wild and you guys know
that I love this stuff I always use it
and just with an angled brush I'm going
to create a thick line on my upper lash
line and I'm also going to wing it out
and I know that this can be a little bit
hard and take a little bit longer for
others so that's why I didn't include
any eye shadow on the top lid now take
any primer and you want to prime your
lower lash line because we're going to
be putting some eyeshadow on there so
this is the time where you can choose
your favorite color and for this
tutorial I decided to use this kind of
bright neon blueish teal eyeshadow and I
just patted that on my lower lash line
then of course you want to curl your
lashes and apply mascara for the fourth
time yeah I got pretty tired of this
making these tutorials in a row in one
day but that's basically it for this
look and it's really simple but also has
a really nice pop of color for all you
rebels out there who like to add a
little pop of color that's basically it
so now I'm going to grab any clear
mascara and this one is from covergirl
and I'm just going to apply this all
over my lashes
and now you're done with the tutorial I
decided to add this into the video
because I want to remind you guys that
natural beauty is the one that's most
important and you should never be afraid
to express it I just wanted to remind
you guys that you don't need make-up to
be beautiful because you are beautiful
everyone is inside and out I hope you
guys enjoyed today's video tell me what
