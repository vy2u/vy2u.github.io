a back-to-school supplies haul and I'm
really excited for this video just
because a lot of you guys have requested
me to do this because I did it last year
and there's a fly and I'm gonna kill it
I anyways um I did this last year and it
was a total hit I think it's like my
most viewed video and a lot of you guys
really really liked that video so I
decided that I'm gonna be doing it again
this year so I just came back from
Target sorry it's kind of really you
know in the summer time a lot of you
guys have already started school but I'm
starting at this Monday so I just got it
today from Target so once again I got
everything from Target so once again I
got everything from Target so don't ask
me where I got everything because
everything is from Target
ok so first I'll just start out with the
binders and favors and notebooks and
stuff like that and I don't know if you
guys know this about me but when I buy
things especially like school supplies
and stuff like that everything kind of
has to have a theme everything has to
match to each other or else I'm gonna go
crazy
I swear so last year my theme was kind
of like Barbie / Dora / Paul Frank
everything was like pink and bright
colored and I don't really want to do
that again this year so the thing for me
this year is everything's kind of like
gray or green or turquoise or blue or
black kind of like that okay so the
first thing is I got a little binder
thing this is like the heavy-duty one I
don't know but it's green I don't really
know what I'm gonna use this for maybe
I'll use it just to put on my homework
in it for like every single class and
things I need to study with or I might
just use this for all over just like one
class or one subject so I'm not really
sure but I always end up using or
needing one of these so I just got one
because I know I'm going to use it but I
don't know what I'm gonna use it for
okay so now for the folders definitely I
recommend you guys getting plastic
folders because in my opinion whenever I
use like paper folders which is what I
use last year they legit like got
destroyed after one month
because you know I'm a reckless kid so
everything runs up and stuff like that
and I absolutely love plastic folders so
I decided to get them this year and
instead like the five-star ones and I
love these because these have four
pockets so we have one two three four so
great for organizing you know your
papers and notes and stuff like that so
I got five of these so I got a green one
a navy blue one a black one and two to
twelve to turquoise ones so they look
like that or blue I don't really know
they look blue in this camera but yeah I
just got those okay so now for the
notebooks I absolutely love these
they're so cute and all the notebooks
that I got were 100% recycled which is
you know great
Go Green so the first one was my
favorite
it's grey and it just has a little city
on it and it's really cute they all have
great backs which is what I like also so
got that one then I also got this black
one that says I'm greater than you then
I got this green one which just looks
like a leaf
then I got this one which just has
flowers on it which is like you but I
don't like the red on it I wish it
didn't have red on it maybe I'll like
Sharpie it over cuz kind of bothers me
because I don't have anything red in
this like theme going here so yeah I'm
like that OCD I honestly think I'm gonna
like Sharpie over that red and then the
last notebook I got is this one which is
like cute because it has a little black
kitty with glasses and a bowtie so I
like that also I don't know why but I
can never really go through my school
year without some sort of planner to
help me you know stay organized and
stuff
so I got a college academic planner and
of course an S to match my theme so it
has green and grey stripes and I really
like this planner just because it has
because it has these kind of like dates
on it but then also it has like that
kind too so I like that way so now more
onto the funner things so definitely
recommend you guys to look in the
makeups
cosmetics aisle 4 a pencil case just
because for me at my target all the
pencil cases in the school supplies
aisles we're like really big and like
cheesy and I don't know I really didn't
like them so I definitely recommend
looking at cosmetics bags just because
they're probably gonna be a lot cuter
and stuff like that
so I got this one and this is originally
a makeup bag but I'm going to be using
it as a pencil case just looks like this
it's polka dotted and the inside just
looks like that so no I really like it
you know matches with my theme so
definitely recommend doing that because
I really do not like their school like
pencil cases I only like their makeup
bags so I got that also I'm a huge pen
lover I love writing in pens so I got a
bunch of black ballpoint pens these were
like the cheapest ones I could find so I
just you know grab those then also I got
these big pencil mechanical pencils
these are the only pencils I will ever
use this is my favorite brand and type
of pencil out there I cannot write with
regular pencils it drives me crazy I
don't know why I have to write
mechanical and these are the only brands
that I like as well and these are number
two pencils so yeah I got a bunch of
these then I also got these little
marker pens you know the ones that like
teachers used to correct with I always
wanted them and I never got them so I
finally got them this year and they're
really cute so had to get those then
also I got some pocket highlighter pens
now since I always always writing pens
and my notes and things like that
I hate scratching out when I you know
misspelled and stuff like that so I
decided to get two wideouts and these
are the little like whiteout tape things
so definitely need to get one of those
because last year I didn't have one and
it drives me crazy so I finally got one
so then also I got these jumbo paper
clips I don't know why but I like these
better just because I feel like they
kind of hold papers better and they can
hold a lot more papers together so I
really like them plus they're really big
and cute so I mean
come on so then also I got whole
reinforcements I think I don't know I
suck at everything but yeah so I
definitely definitely recommend you guys
getting these for example like if you're
getting if you're gonna get like a
binder and you're gonna put you know
sheets of paper in it for me my papers
always like rip out cuz the holes like
whatever rip and then you know like it's
just really annoying to deal with so I
definitely recommend getting these
they're just like little stickers that
you put around the holes of the paper if
they rip so that you know you can place
them back into your little binder so I
really like these and there's about 544
in there so that's good then I also got
these little neon dot stickers there's
like 300 here and also I think these
would be great just for labeling things
like for example for a certain test you
can put a sticker on like sheets that
you want to like review and look back on
certain tests and they're great for like
labeling and stuff like that so I got
these and these were like really really
cheap they're like a dollar then I also
recommend getting these little sticky
things a little like note tabs just
because you know if you're like studying
for like a history test or something
then you know you can always just kind
of like mark off what page you have to
read or like for notes or whatever I
don't know but I always end up wanting
to like use these so I got them and
they're just great for like kind of
organizing you know like your notes and
stuff like that okay so the last thing I
got and I know that it was like but not
that many things but the last thing I
got is actually a water bubble I've
always wanted one of these and there's
like a bunch of different sizes I think
there's the ready I'm not sure if this
is the middle one the largest one was
just like too big for me because I know
that I will hate you know carrying that
in my backpack just cuz it's so big and
bulky but I feel like I think this is
the medium-sized one but I feel like
it's the perfect like little size for
school and I think pretty much all you
guys know what this is because I know
that like Blair's obsessed with these
water bottles and basically it just like
filters as
drink which is great it's gonna help me
want to like drink more water because
it's so cute so I got one of those and
it's black so you know I guess it
matches my theme so basically that is it
for all of my little supply haul
organization stuff I don't know so yeah
that's basically it I hope you guys
enjoy this video I know it's really
requested so I was so excited to do it
and I'm so sad because now I'm done I
love doing these videos and I can only
do them once in your switches sucks but
yeah so I will see you guys for a new
video very soon and that's about it so I
will talk to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
