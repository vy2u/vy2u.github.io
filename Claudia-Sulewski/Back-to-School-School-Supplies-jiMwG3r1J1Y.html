doing my school supplies video which I
love doing these videos I don't really
know why but anyways I quickly want to
mention that everything that I'm going
to be showing in today's video is all
from Target and speaking of Target being
a clean and clear ambassador I get to
find out about different promotions and
deals going on that I can share with you
guys
so recently clean and clear and guerilla
which is an organization dedicated to
better the lives of young women in
impoverished countries have teamed up
with Target to offer you guys a special
in-store promotion which is going to be
lasting until August 31st so right now
if you stop by your nearest Target and
you buy any to clean and clear products
you will get this special edition girl
up tote bag I will also be having a
giveaway more related to this subject so
stay tuned to the end of this video if
you want to find out more about that but
now I'm just gonna get into what these
school supplies that I bought for this
year so for those of you who have been
watching me for a very long time then
you would know that especially when it
comes to school supplies I'm very very
OCD there has to be some sort of theme
going on and everything has to match so
this year's theme is basically cool
colors so everything is either black
blue green turquoise or white so it's
kind of the cooler tone colors kind of
similar to Leicester actually so yeah
everything had to match like literally
you will notice that everything matches
and I'm obsessive it I'm really happy so
first I'm gonna start with the boring
stuff like notebooks and binders and all
of that so first off I have some paper
then I bought three binders by the way I
don't have like a list of things that I
have to purchase I'm just going off of
what I use or needed from last year and
I just kind of bought whatever I wanted
to so I don't know it depends on you
know what school you go to some people
get those lists and some people don't so
I have three different binders the first
one is black and these are all one-inch
binders because I always find that you
never really end up needing a bigger one
is big let's just take up a lot of room
the next one I
is this really really pretty kind of
sky-blue color my lighting is really
weird right now because it was just
raining so I'm sorry about that
and also my cheeks are looking really
pink too I don't know why but yeah and
then my third binder is a darker blue
color it's more like a medium blue then
for my notebooks I got five notebooks
and these are like the cheapest ones
that I can find they're by the brand med
Meade I don't know how you pronounce
that but the first one looks like this
it's just black the next one is also
black and it's just straight the next
one is green it looks like that the
fourth one is also green and it's
striped and the last one is my favorite
it has that like zigzag pattern and it's
turquoise so those are all my notebooks
so now onto folders
I am completely obsessed with these
folders I used some last year and they
are so like durable they don't rip they
don't tear or anything like that they
don't break them I just got really dirty
that's why I bought new ones but these
are the 5 star 4 pocket folders these
are intense like let me just tell you
you open it up you have to and there's
another flap and you have two more and
then this one's kind of like a half way
pocket or I don't even know what's my
calls but I love these so I got a black
one I got five so I got three black ones
because I just love black and then also
I got these two this one's like a
highlighter lime green and then this one
is just like a dark turquoise but it
looks a blue on camera I'm sorry this
thing is really bad so done with the
boring stuff now let's get into it be
more fun stuff like pens and pencils so
first off I got one of these little
Locker like mirror organizational things
I had to get the really small one
because our lockers at my high school
are so thin hopefully this fits the door
I'm sure it will but yeah I got that of
course you know it's black it has to
match then for my pencil case I went
very simple this year it's just a black
pencil case and the pencil case is at
Target we're absolutely like discussing
they were all just very childish and
plastic and I didn't like any of them so
I
we recommend going to be cosmetics aisle
and looking through their makeup bags
and just watch ready
it was sesang even the inside matches
like honestly if the inside was like red
I don't know what I do with myself so
thank God it's like a teal color so it
matches perfectly it's very simple they
also came in different patterns as well
they have like polka dots and some
floral pattern but I was just too cool
for the patterns I just had to get the
point
so then next I got some black pens love
writing pens and I got these last year
we were fine then I also got four
highlighters these are the clicky ones
so I really like the use of a sharpie
brand then also I got some pencils and
I've been buying these pencils ever
since I can remember they're just the
big pencils and mechanical ones I'm
pretty sure like everyone buys these but
I hate regular pencils I only use
mechanical pencils so I always get those
the next thing I got are the Paper Mate
marker pens I definitely recommend
getting these I got them last year
actually the same color too
and I ended up using them so much for
notes if you like want to make your
title a different color something I
actually like taking notes of these as
well and they were really good for like
projects and um that kind of stuff I
don't know I just ended up using them
for a lot of things like grading and all
that so I definitely recommend getting
them but they're like the teacher pens
that teachers always used to grade so I
feel like we're using them I guess then
I also got some whiteout because I
rarely ever use pencils only if I need
to so I got the big whiteout tape
whiteout I don't like the the liquid one
I only like the tape ones and of course
they match they had like a pink and
purple one I think but you know I had to
get the green and blue ones thank God
they have something that matched to my
theme then if these are a little bit
more fun I just got them because I
thought they were cute and I always end
up buying cute things so first there are
these binder clips and they go perfectly
with my theme so I decided that I must
use them for something I don't really
what yet but you know those are cute so
the next thing is kind of pointless but
they were really cute and maybe I will
find a reason to use them but they are
filed bans you can put them over like
notebooks and folders and stuff to keep
things together they're just like really
big rubber bands and I just thought they
were really cute so I had to buy them
they were like three dollars but I mean
who knows maybe I'll use them for
something so they're literally just like
really big rubber bands that's kind of
cool maybe they can like keep my big
books together or something I I don't
know
next thing I got are they posted dermal
tabs I got these last year and they were
very very handy I mostly use them for
history because when you have a really
big book and you're trying to search
through what chapter you're on these are
great because you can just tab on
whatever you're like chapter you're on
or what you have for homework or
anything like that so I really really
really recommend getting these they are
so helpful and you end up using them a
lot then I also got a planner for my
homework and this is the Heather Bailey
weekly slash monthly planner looks like
this it's like a turquoise color the
strap is brown I kind of maybe man I
wish it was black but whatever so let me
just show you guys how it looks it looks
like that this is how the weekly planner
looks so it gives you a lot of room for
every day and then it just has every
month going down on the side and then
also at the beginning of each month
there's like a calendar which I don't
really use I just use the weekly part
but this is great for homework I got one
similar to this for last year and it was
very useful so got that so that
concludes my school supply video
