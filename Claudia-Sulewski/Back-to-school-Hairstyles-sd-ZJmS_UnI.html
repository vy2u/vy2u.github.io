doing a back to school videos and as
soon be hairstyles and I'm really
excited to do this but before I show you
guys all the hairstyles that I want to
show on today's video I want to mention
one thing and I know that it's really
hard to curl your hair in the morning
because it honestly takes me like 40
minutes to comb my hair and that's just
not enough time in the morning to do
that for school so basically the ways
that you can do it is you can use hot
rollers and you can actually sleep with
them on and then just kind of you know
take them off in the morning the way
that I use is I use these little like
material things that clip also if you
don't have these little thingies or hot
rollers you can always just put your
hair into two braids or three braids and
then you'll wake up with really nice
like wavy hair but of course we don't
want to hair curly constrain your hair
because it is doesn't take that long or
I can just do your natural hair so I
just want to show that so now I'm going
to show you guys how my hair looked in
the morning after using these and then I
will carry on with the hair cells
alright so this morning and this is how
my hair looked when I was sleeping but
I'm just gonna take everything down and
yeah we'll see how everything turned out
okay so obviously my hair is really
really like bouncy and curly and crazy
but don't worry I'm going to make it
look a little bit more normal
um but I really love this little like
technique or whatever because I used
absolutely no heat which is like the
greatest part because it's not like bad
for your hair or anything so now what
you're going to do is usually never come
and you're going to brush through your
hair this is gonna soften up those curls
that are freakin crazy
so you can just leave it plain like this
and there you go now you have a
hairstyle that looks like you took
forever to do but really didn't take
anything at all but so now I'm going to
be showing you guys all the different
hairstyles that I kind of came up with
and stuff like that for school so this
stuff wasn't really like a much needed
stuff but I just decided to work with
curly hair for this tutorial so yeah
let's just get right into this and of
course you can achieve all these look
with straight hair yes so let's get onto
the first hairstyle
okay so the first hairstyle as you can
tell is going to be really really easy I
do this all the time though it's super
easy right when you're out the door
basically what you're going to do is
you're going to just take your front
hairs or your bangs or whatever and
you're just going to take it and twist
it place the top of your head push up
like forward a little bit to create a
little bit of a poof and then just place
your bobby pin and there you go so now
you have your little little poof up on
top of your head and your bangs are
going to be out of your face so I always
like this because it's really simple but
it's still really cute so that's first
look
okay so as you can tell the second look
is also going to be really easy and I
promise this are going to be the last
ones that are really simple that
everyone knows but I just want to clued
in there because sometimes do legite
only have like one minute to do your
hair and these are really easy so the
second one is basically we're just going
to mini braid and we're going to pull it
back and whatever bangs back you could
also just pull it back with this if you
want to but whatever just going to split
this chunk into three pieces and you're
just going to do a regular braid
so now all you're gonna do is grab a
bobby pin and just pin it back like that
and that's also my little pieces are
sticking out because they're curly
this is also a really really easy look
and it's so really cute so that's it for
the second look
okay so now for the third look we're
going to be doing a braided headband
which is basically just making a braid
out of your hair and turning into
headbands and I feel that when I wear
this at school it kind of like loosens
up and it doesn't really hold my hair
back so I like to take a really thin
headband and use that as a base and then
I might put my hair over it so it looks
like it's a braided headband so
basically I'm just going to take this
pink rubber headband anything that's
really thin will work and we're just
gonna start out by putting that on our
heads okay so just like that sorry my
forehead is peeling so you can see I
have like spots all over it okay so you
have your little headband like that and
now we're gonna do is you're gonna grab
any long chunk from behind your ear I'm
gonna go about this much pull the rest
of my hair back so just gonna do braids
so once you get to the end I'm just
gonna tie this off with a clear elastic
this and I can pull all your hair back
what you're going to do is underneath
all your hair you're just gonna grab the
braid and just place it over the
headband like so and then you're just
gonna grab a bobby pin and just pin it
in place I'm just gonna tuck that behind
my ear like that
and then I'm also going to bobby pin to
the other side just so that it doesn't
you know like fall off the headband and
you don't want the headband to be
showing so so this is one of my favorite
hair styles just because it's so cute
you'll get a lot of compliments on it
and I think it looks very bohemian and
stuff and it's obviously really really
simple like I just showed you guys so I
love this hairstyle and it's really
quick so yeah let's get onto the other
one
okay so for the next look you're going
to start out by putting your hair in the
middle part okay so what you're going to
do is you're gonna grab your things or
just your front hair or anything you
don't have to have bangs to do this and
you're just going to create a
three-piece braid
okay so once I'm done I'm just gonna tie
it off with a clear elastic and then I'm
going to take the braid and just put
across my head but I'm gonna tuck it
underneath other pieces of hair so I'm
gonna like grab some hair and I'm gonna
bobby pin it underneath so you can't see
the bobby pin like that so now it looks
like the braid is kind of like hiding in
the hair so now I'm just going to do
that to the other side
okay so now you're done this is the look
that I actually did to my eighth grade
dance cuz a lot of you guys were asking
about that so basically just looks like
that it's really cute and simple so I
really like this one and that's
basically it it is really easy so let's
get on to the other one
I really love this next look because
it's kind of a great cute
you know hairstyle that will kind of
keep your head out of your face and
stuff like that so basically what you're
losing I grab a hair tie the furbling
one that matches your hair color just in
case if it peeks through and you're just
gonna put your hair into a low ponytail
you can pull your bangs into it as well
but I'm just gonna kind of leave them
out like that
then I'm going to grab my hair and just
kind of tug on it in the back just so
that it's a little bit more you know
loose and stuff like that
okay so regularly what people do is
they'll describe a chunk and just like a
wrap it around the hair time to not like
let it show through but what I'm going
to do is I'm actually going to grab a
piece and I'm going to turn it into a
braid and then I'm going to wrap the
braid around it
okay so first now I'm just going to tie
it off with a clear elastic I take the
braid and just wrap it around the hair
tight and then I'm just going to bobby
pin it in and that's how it's gonna look
so you just have a little braid wrapping
around the hair tie and I think it looks
really cute and but I really love how
the braid looks instead of just taking a
chunk of hair and then you can just pull
out a couple of pieces in the front like
I did right here and just kind of mess
around with your bangs and stuff and it
sorta looked really cute so it's just
kind of like a more glammed up side
ponytail I don't know so I really love
this look and it's really easy so onto
the next one
so now I'm going to show you guys a rope
braid and it's really fast and easy once
you get the hang of it because when you
first kind of start out it's a little
bit confusing you're like what am i
doing but once you kind of get the hang
of it it's actually really really easy
to do and I think it really looks cool
other than just you know doing a regular
braid or anything okay so if you want
you can include your bangs in here or
not I'm just I'm not going to I'm just
going to leave them out so make sure you
don't include them so basically we can
do is you're going to grab all of your
hair and just split it into two pieces
and what you want to do is twist them
around each other twice just to start it
and then we're going to do is you're
going to twist each piece individually
in the same direction so I'm gonna have
on both twisting this way so I'm going
to twist this one outwards I guess
they're in the same direction but
they're kind of opposites so I'm going
to spin this one outward okay I'm having
troubles here
okay so outward and then this one is
gonna go inward so as they're spinning
by themselves twist them around each
other and just keep making sure that
you're twisting the two pieces so once
you don't think you're just going to
grab a clear elastic and tie it off and
basically that's it so now you're done I
have like a bunch of layers and my hair
is kind of curly so didn't turn out as
well as I planned it to so yeah it kind
of looks messy but I don't know if you
can kind of see the fact that it's
supposed to make so this look is really
easy and it's a great way to just kind
of keep your hair out of your face just
like the other one and yes let's get on
to the nut
you
so one time in one of my videos I just
kind of threw my hair up in a bun and I
did really really fast and everyone's
like okay wait how did you do that
because I know that everyone has those
days before school where you're just
wearing you know like a t-shirt and
sweatpants and just throw your hair up
in a bun because you don't feel like
really getting ready I mean at least I
know I have those days so one of my
friends or family friends actually
taught me how to do this cool bun that
takes probably like five seconds to do
and I just want to show you guys how to
do it because I think it's really easy
grab the hair type on your right wrist
and then um throw your hair you know
throw your head upside down and grab
your hair and pretend like you're about
to put a ponytail in so let me just do
that okay so just like this I feel like
bend over okay
and we're gonna do is when the hair ties
on your right wrist you're gonna grab
your left hand pull it and then once
you're like halfway down your hair
you're gonna twist your wrist and cup
the bun with your hands and then the
hair tie is going to be on top of your
hand and you're just gonna take your
right hand and just pull it over and
you're done so it looks like this it's a
little bit messy because my hair is
curly but that's basically it it's
really really fast and easy
now once you have that you can just kind
of mess up a bit by grabbing some front
pieces and just kind of pulling them out
and that's basically it
I always do this one you know I'm just
kind to lazy I don't want my hair my
face or anything like that and it's
really really easy really fast and I
love it so yeah let's get on to the
final hairstyle that I have for you guys
this is gonna be the last hairstyle and
it's really really fast really easy
great for those days where you just
don't feel like doing anything to your
hair and you're having bad hair day or
anything like that
it's just putting in a thick headband
and I know you're thinking okay Claudia
why are you talking about how to put it
then and we all know how to do it but I
do it just a little bit differently so
basically the kind of headband so I'm
going to be showing in this little
tutorial is these little thick headbands
I love them because you can get them in
so many colors just kind of match into
your outfit and um what's it called so I
don't know I love them so I'm just gonna
use this bright blue one just because I
feel like it and pretty easy just you
know put in your hair okay so now you
got the headband in your hair and I know
this is a really bright and obnoxious
color but just ignore that I'll usually
wear like black ones or something but
now we're going to do is you take the
headband push it back and then push it
forward kind of so you create a little
bit of a poof right there just to give
more volume on the top of your head then
on the side right here we're just going
to pull our hairs little baby hairs
through also you can do is you can grab
a comb and like use that to help pull
them out but I'm just gonna use my
fingers but just like that I know it's
really really basic but you know it kind
of spices up a headband a little
but just by adding the proof and pulling
some hair through and stuff like that
but you know this is really easy on
those days where you don't feel like
doing anything you know because I have
those all the time so that's basically
it for all of my school hairstyles
I hope that you guys are gonna try out
some of them so if you do can recreate
any of the hairstyles that I've shown in
