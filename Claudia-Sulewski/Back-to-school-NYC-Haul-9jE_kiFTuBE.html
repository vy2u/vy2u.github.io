at my New York City Hall and I'm also
calling it my back to school haul just
because a lot of the clothes that I got
are like for fall time so I'm going to
be wearing them for school and stuff
like that and also keep in mind that
I've been saving for a very long time
for this trip because I rarely ever go
to New York so I want to make the most
of it so I did buy a lot of stuff but
I've been saving for a while for all
this stuff and that's really it so I'm
just gonna get right into it so first
I'm gonna show you what I got it Topshop
so first off I got this sweater it's
white and it has hot pink like quotation
marks on it so it looks really cute with
like leggings cuz it's like oversized
and it's really warm and this was on
sale for $30 and originally it was 72 so
I had to get that next I got this gray
sweater and this was only $13 it was
also on sale and it looks like this it's
just a great chunky sweater and it has
shorter sleeves and it's very warm and
cute it'll be great for the fall time
and then the last thing that I got from
Topshop were these leggings oh my gosh
I'm obsessed with these leggings they
were kind of a little more expensive
they're like $40 or something
at the top they're dark blue and as you
go down they get lighter and lighter so
they're like ombre leggings and of
course I have to get them because you
guys know that I'm obsessive ombre so
yeah I'm so so excited to wear these
then I got three things from brandy
melville the first thing is this
backpack right here obviously I'm not
gonna use it for school just because
it's really small but I'm definitely
gonna use it for like a purse so it's
like a grey acid-wash kind of Jean
looking backpack and it's very cute and
then I also got a navy blue t-shirt and
I'm sure you guys have seen these shirts
everywhere because everyone was like
obsessed with these at one point but
it's the
like skull back shirt so there was
cutouts on the back and it looks like a
skull and then it's kind of longer in
the back as well and that's just plain
in the front never got one of these
shirts so I finally decided to buy one
and the last thing I got from there are
these little hair ties right here I got
them and a bunch of different colors
actually gave my mom my green one but
they were a dollar each and they look
like this they're just like little
ribbons but they're very stretchy and
these are very good for your hair
because they prevents like breakage
because normally hair ties can easily
break your hair cuz your hair like knots
around it but it doesn't do that to
these and also they don't leave dents in
your hair as well and also they look
cuter on your wrist than regular ones a
bunch of other different places are
starting to sell these like Sephora and
Francesca's and that's all I know
but I'm sure you can find these
somewhere so those are really fun then
we also went to necessary clothing and
the necessary clothing in New York was
huge and like a basement and it was just
so overwhelming but yeah I got a bunch
of stuff from there so first off I got
this kind of off-white cream-colored
shirt and it has two pockets in the
front it's like a button-down shirt and
it's a little bit longer in the back and
just looks like that very cute to check
tuck into like high-waisted shorts or
just like jeans then I also got this
black belt it was like $3 or $4 and it's
just black and normal I didn't have a
black belt so that's why I got it then I
also got this chiffon like button-down
shirt and it kind of looks like it'd be
like a granny shirt yeah it looks really
bad on camera but no it actually looks
really cute with like jeans or whatever
but I've been eyeing this online for a
very long time so when I saw and try it
on I fell in love so yeah it looks
definitely like a granny shirt but I
promise it's cute and then the last
shirt that I got oh wait no anymore I
got this one which is similar to the
other one but it's just a mint green and
this one kind of looks big but it looks
very cute because it's like kind of a
sighs so I can just like roll up the
sleeves and then like tuck it in in the
front so that's gonna be really cute
with like jeans or something and then
the last year I got this was on sale for
like five dollars or something but it's
very simple where's the back okay so it
looks like this it's just a black shirt
and it has like a v-neck cut and it's
just lower in the back so this will be
great for leggings because I've been
obsessed with like statement leggings so
this would be a great shirt to wear them
because it covers your butt and it's
also very simple so you can wear like
statement leggings with that and then
also I got a pair of leggings from
necessary clothing and these are so cool
I don't really know how to describe the
pattern it's like it's not like acid
wash it's not like distress it's just
like kind of yeah I don't know just
that's how it looks so it's like a dark
grey legging and it's like that and also
what I really like about it is it has
this band at the top so you could like
fold it down if you want but yeah so
these were like 18 dollars I think so
then we also stopped by Amsterdam which
I've never heard of this store before
but we went in because it looked nice
and I got one sweatshirt or sweater from
there and I'm obsessed with this sweater
it's so cute so it's a knit sweater and
it's just like a creamy color and then
on the shoulder it's what's kind of
lower than the shoulders but on the
artist there's these little like cheetah
patches I guess with gold spikes going
down it and it is so so cute so it's on
both of the sleeves and um I think it's
so cute oh my gosh I am so excited to
wear this sweater so yeah obsessed with
that it was like it's like 40 dollars
but whatever it was worth it so then we
also went to this a jewelry store called
so good that's how it looks and the
entire store was 50% off so we're like
heck yep and I bought five things and I
already ripped off all beads hair
but all of them were between like ten to
twenty dollars so take 50% off all of
them were like five to ten dollars so
the first piece I got is this bracelet
right here it has like gold and silver
balls on it and I think it's so cute
then I got this bracelet which is black
and it has gold skulls on it and I
really like these because you can adjust
them by pulling the strings so it's
really easy to make it fit your wrist
and then also I got another bracelet
which is black and it just has a gold
cross with silver diamonds on it so and
this one is also adjustable which is
really nice
then I got two necklaces from so good
and they're actually the same necklace
just in different colors but the first
one okay so they're they look like this
they're just necklaces with like a
sideways cross on it so this one's gold
and it has silver diamonds on it and
then the other necklace I got oh my gosh
just want to so cute it has a black
chain with black diamonds so can you see
the diamonds I don't know but this one
looks so cute actually the three
bracelets I got look really good
together
that's why I bought them so that's what
I got from so good everything was 50%
off so it's a very good deal then we
also went to Urban Outfitters and I got
two things so first off I got this shirt
it looks like this it's very simple but
I love these types of shirts just to
wear with like skinny jeans and converse
to school so it's like a quarter length
or half way sleeve and then it's striped
it's black at the top and it's very good
quality it feels very soft so I'm really
excited to wear that and then also I got
a foam case and it looks like this ever
since like I can I've been obsessed them
so I just had to give this phone case
and actually me and Sui PDX are matching
so it will have the same case the other
thing I don't like is how its makes the
front of your phone very vulnerable
because it doesn't really cover it so
I'm gonna have to get like a really good
um like screen protector because mine
fell off but it's really cute it's like
$15
there's that then we also went to
Sephora and I originally wasn't planning
on buying anything but I ended up buying
three things but I actually wanted these
things really good so Oh first off I got
the Too Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer I
was actually meaning to buy this so I
lied but um you guys know that my first
one broke and I finally got around to
buying a new one so it looks like that
and I got it in chocolate which is the
darker color and it smells like
chocolate and it actually tastes like
chocolate too or it tastes like sugary
but don't ask why I know of it but um
yeah so I got that and then also I got
an urban decay eyeliner because I've
never owned a brown eyeliner and I
really want to get a good one and I love
the urban decay 24/7 glide-on eye
pencils so this one is in demolition so
I'm just gonna give you guys a swatch
I love how creamy and pigmented these
are so it's more on the darker side but
it doesn't have any shimmer to it it's
just a matte dark brown so I'm obsessed
with this I'm wearing it right now and
then the last thing I got is the Urban
Decay all nighter long-lasting makeup
setting spray I've been wanting to buy
this for a very very long time but I
couldn't choose between this one or the
like D slick one I think it's called for
like oil control but I ended up getting
this one because all the girls were
saying that this one's really good and
I've used it a couple times and I really
liked it and yeah I'm very very excited
for that I keep saying that for
everything I'm just I'm excited for
everything ok and then also they gave me
this sample from bareMinerals I don't
really use the company but I mean when I
was I'll try it out
alright so that's everything that I got
in New York but yesterday I actually
went shopping with Adriana because she
had to go and she was like dude do you
want to come with me and I was like yeah
sure so I ended up getting two things
yeah okay so the first thing I got from
H&amp;amp;M was actually a men
sweater I walked in and I was like oh my
god that's so cute and they drowned I
was like that's a men's sweater and I
was like dude I don't care I'm buying it
um so yeah it looks like this it's
actually pretty girly for a men's
sweater so it's just cream-colored and
it has like the front pocket like
hoodies do but then at the top it has
this really cute detailing it's like
jean that has the three buttons it has a
hood and it's just really warm I ended
up wearing it for the rest day because
it like matched with my outfit but I
think this will be really cute was just
like jeans and ogz to wear to school so
yeah kind of weird how some men's
sweatshirt but I mean whatever is cute
and then also I just got one shirt from
forever 21 it's this shirt right here
it's very long I got it in a size medium
and it's tied right there because that's
the way that I'm going to be styling it
when I was trying it on so I probably
wear this with like black leggings or
something but I like this shirt because
well first of all the design is really
cute because it has like these cool
little like rips and cutouts on the side
and also what I like is that it actually
has detailing on the back so it has
buttons going down and then also has
that same pattern I don't know if it's
just me but I feel like forever 21 is
always like to cheap to put a design on
the back of the shirt so it's really
cute on the front and then you flip over
on the back and it's just like plain and
I don't know why I just really hate that
so I was actually really surprised to
see that this was really cute on the
back as well so I had to buy it it was
like 22 dollars so it wasn't that bad
but it's gonna look really cute with
liking so I just talked to like a minute
about this shirt but that is it for my
haul I hope you guys enjoyed it and I'm
really excited to put everything in my
closet and organize everything I know
I'm so weird but that is it for today's
video hopefully it wasn't too long and
that's it so I will see you guys later
