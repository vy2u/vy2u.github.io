cold because I was sick for a little bit
so I might sound a little bit tired or
like weird or whatever but that's why so
not a while ago I went to Target and
bought my school supplies for school
because it's on its way so today I
decided to do sort of like a haul of
what I got but then again sort of like
organizational tips for you guys
and so remember that I'm not high school
yet so I still get like little like
school supplies it's like lists so it's
like I got coloring stuff too which
seems so childish
yeah I have to get that stuff because it
was like required um so first off I'm
just gonna go ahead with like my folders
and notebooks and stuff so first of all
this wasn't necessary but I love getting
binders and I think these classic ones
are the best because they have like
little pockets right here in the front
in the back the back I'm probably gonna
put my schedule because I don't really
remember it the first couple days but
then I think I memorize it and then the
front I could put like pictures make a
collage or whatever
of course it's pink I don't know why but
there's a lot of pink things for this
year but um basically I for every single
class I get a folder and a notebook for
each class and this binder isn't
specifically for any class this is
actually where I will like I will be
carrying this around everywhere with me
and in here I keep all of my folders so
let me show you guys that folders you
guys are gonna think I'm so childish so
of course Barbie you know okay I chose
this one for the front because it
matched the best but I have six folders
in here for math science social studies
la Spanish and health I think those are
the only ones ok well I've six in here
and they like recorded at six holders so
hi this one looks like it on the back
hello kitty of course Paul Frank another
Paul Franklin Tinkerbell and Dora okay I
know those seem like really childish
boulders but it's kind of like a jump
between off and my friends we all get
like the four year old like folders
because they're so cute so basically I
carry dis around everywhere me it's just
a binder and I have a notebook for every
class like notebooks you know so
basically I only like to carry my
folders in this little binder because I
don't want to carry all of my notebooks
because then I'm just going to be
dragging around a lot of weight that's
unnecessary and the reason why like I
used to just take one folder and one
notebook to class to each class and stop
by every passing period but what I
really like about this whole binder idea
is that let's say you had extra time in
one class then you can like work on your
homework and do you have like all of
your folders in here so you can go ahead
and go in like your social studies
folder and then pull on your homework
while you're in Spanish class like you
guys that I'm saying and it's just every
and just during the passing period I
would go ahead and maybe grab like two
notebooks for the next two classes or
that kind of stuff so yeah I've got six
folders in here one binder then I have
my notebooks and
I have five notebooks so I have these
one subject notebooks so one for science
LA math and social studies these are
really cute and they were like 50 cents
at Target and the folders were $1.00 at
Target which is great and these are just
one subject notebooks so those are for
like core classes then I have this
five-star notebook and look at that it's
like this things that color and this is
a three subject notebook and this is for
Spanish because we use it for each we
have like trimesters three so that's
like you know your subject notebook and
we keep it like that
so those are my notebooks then also we
were like required to get two graphing
papers and notebook paper and they just
asked us to keep this in our locker so
ready last year was I took a random
folder and just put these all in here I
just kept it in my locker then also I
just get some index cards and okay so
then there is also like coloring
supplies because I would like never
needs to turn the air but it's like
required or whatever so I like to keep I
don't carry mice like colors colors
supplies anywhere unless I need it so I
just keep it in an extra bag in my
locker and I have this pink like zebra
baggie and it just has scissors for us
like the little kid ones markers glue
coloring pencils and I think that's
about it and I just keep that in my
locker and the last thing is my pencil
case and I don't know if you guys saw
this but this is my pencil case it's
it's pretty big like it fits a lot of
stuff in it which is really great
the other thing I'm kind of mad about is
it doesn't move
that's okay anyways so I'm just gonna
show you guys what's in here so I've got
post-it notes these things are awesome
for like random notes that you can slip
into here for like tests to do to like
what projects are due then I've got my
calculator gosh everything's like pink
okay then I have then I bought like a
pack of pencils and a pack of pens and
what I like to do is I don't dump the
entire pack of pencils like I only take
a couple because I lose them all the
time so what I end up doing is all my
like extra supplies I put in like some
kind of little baggie or whatever and
this is just like a plastic bag and I'll
keep this at like the bottom of my
locker at the top so throughout the year
if I ever end up losing all my pencils I
refer back to this and I have fresh
brand-new pencils and then also I just
keep like a protractor and like that
kind of stuff in here and like my rulers
and extra postage notes and pens and
stuff like that so anyways back to my
pencil case I only have pencils in here
I have a bunch of just blue and black
heads I love writing in pens I do not
like pencils so all of my notes are
always in pen I'm I just have an eraser
oh and then I have a bunch of the a
bunch of whiteboard markers or Spanish
class because we like always use white
boards and analyze
it's funny so yeah and then also I just
got let's see like losing everything
today oh here we go I've just got two
highlighters and that's it that's in
here
not that much I would also have red pens
in here but I still have to buy those or
I think my friend is giving some but I
don't have those yet and also this is
not everything that I keep in my bag I
tried to keep it simple and just show
you guys what I carry oh and I forgot to
show you guys these do like all together
but um I just kind of want to keep it
simple for chase video just to show you
guys what school supplies I keep in my
little pencil case but by like the
second week of school I like the first
week of school I'll end up having like
lip gloss and like hand lotion in here
and like just a bunch of stuff because I
end up carrying this thing ends up being
like completely full by them like the
first week of school but that's
basically it so that's how I kind of
stay organized so if I walk around
classes I'm you should just bring this
this and then I'll take like what to do
both books in here and then I'll just
kind of put it on in there like that
close it I take it for like my next two
classes then I switch out the notebooks
so that's basically what I do and then I
also have like school books but I don't
have those yet because I'm not in school
yet but I was super excited about school
I don't know about you guys but I just
love going back to school having like
fresh new supplies and stuff like that
and I think I have like a lot of girly
stuff today oh and I got just got an
email but um a lot of pink things I
don't know why because last year I got a
bunch of like differently the green
issue blue things but where's my okay
well that's it for today's video I hope
this helps you guys somewhat and yeah
