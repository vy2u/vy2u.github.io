star and I'm here in New York City for
the mercedes-benz Fashion Week with
Maybelline and style hall so stay tuned
for my interview with maybelline's
makeup artist game I gave so excited to
be backstage with you I love to know
what was the inspiration behind the
makeup look that will be seeing at
tonight's show so this look was about
really beautiful clean skin a very nude
shiny lip with a super exaggerated
winged liner so I know that runaway
makeup can often be very dramatic so how
can one take inspiration from a makeup
look and kind of transform it into a
daily look okay really honestly the best
way to recreate the runway is to just
water down what you see in the runway
for instance with today's look it's
really exaggerated winged liner so for a
day look just make that liner slightly
less exaggerated maybe not so pulled out
and take off the lashes what do you
think is going to be the next biggest
trend in makeup and beauty I feel like
the biggest trend for beauty is gonna be
that winged liner but in any rainbow
assortment of color you are just such a
trend setter I try to be I try so thank
you so much for your time game I'll let
you get back to work it's gonna get back
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
