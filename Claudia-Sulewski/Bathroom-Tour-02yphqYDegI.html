guys have requested for me to do the
room tour and before I do my room tour I
wanted to eliminate a couple of the
things that I have to include like for
example I already did my closet tour and
now I want to do my bathroom tour so
that overall my room tour is gonna be
shorter so it won't be like too long if
you guys know I'm saying so today you
guys can see what I have inside my
bathroom and I think I'd go in pretty
full detail of it so keep watching if
you guys want to find out what's inside
of my bathroom alright so these two
doors are my closet as the most - you
guys know and then the door in the
middle a lot of you guys are asking what
that is and that's my bathroom so let's
just go inside it so first off for
lighting I have this like mini
chandelier and I have like these two on
side um so first when you look on your
right I'm just gonna go ahead and go
through this this is what you see so
starting from the top I have like this
little bathroom thing I don't know it's
like a picture and I have this big
circle mirror to lights and then I have
like these little braces like posters
that I got from my ortho a couple days
not a couple days go oh my god ah I got
my braces and I just kind of put them up
there then I have this sign and
our aim is to keep this bathroom clean
gentlemen your aim will help stand
closer it's shorter than you think
ladies please remain seated for the
entire performance it's funny and then
on to my little sink counter sorry
friends are coming deeper whatever it's
a warning dial and I'm like
but first off I've got like two of my
contacts and no I don't want context
these are actually non-prescriptive
color contacts and I'm going to be
making a video about these soon then I
have this little jar and this is
actually supposed to be a cookie jar and
I just keep hair products in there like
hair ties and bobby pins so pants and
ties our sink then I have some facial
products and then this is all like my
teeth whatever products so I've got like
toothbrush timer toothpaste mouthwash
like a case outlet light switches and
then I have this little like cabinet
area and my mom's friend actually or I
don't know if she's a friend but like
this Pinot she actually painted it by
hand which is really pretty and I really
like it and also have a garbage down
there I'm so first off in these like
middle cabinets I have this like metal
bin and I just keep my curlers and
straight nerves and hair dryers in here
and then I like take it out I'm using it
and then over here I got just like hair
products like volume booster mousse hair
spray and then I have like Windex and
rubbing all come back there and stuff so
that's how that looks and I'm going onto
this right side as you can see this fell
off which kind of sucks the stuff on the
other side too
but in here I don't really use the start
because I just have like mini like
little bags and like more to press
charges or whatever and then on this top
one is like another tooth drawer and it
just has like extra tooth bringing these
like different toothbrushes and floss
and stuff like that then on this side
I've got my hair brushes and hair combs
connects and in this one I've just got
like band-aids and like medicine and
like just random things and I don't
really use that one or that one like
ever then going onto
my left side like right when you walk in
I've got my toilet and then on top of my
toilet I have like bamboo and this
little vase thing marbles another plant
that I have no idea like what kind of
plane it is and a candle then I have a
window and I don't know if you could
tell obviously you can but my mom should
put this like sticker on and it's like
it like Frost's it makes the window look
like it's like frosted snow I'm can see
me um so that's cool and I have like
this little metal thing I'm a bob that I
got from like Marshalls
or something and it just has toilet
paper and magazines in it then I've just
a robe and my curtains to a shower so
this is my shower so up here I just have
a mirror oh and over here I've America
loops okay so you're out of mirror and I
just keep like a little low fuss I think
that's what you call it I don't know and
like soap and stuff like that and then
up there I usually have towels
I've towels there there and a face towel
right here but all my towels are in the
laundry room so don't have them at the
moment and then I have like a stone
shower or whatever like they're like
stone and there's like angels in it like
indents in the wall and then I have just
regular stuff like shaver body wash
coconut body wash shampoo conditioner
that good stuff and then I look down
here I just have a blue carpet is there
anything else oh yeah and my walls
they're like blue with like black not
black brown like streaks on them my mom
actually painted that I don't know I
really like it and yeah I think that's
it
all right so you guys just on my
bathroom tour and
I think it's just a regular bathroom you
know I just kind of have things that
everyone has in their bathroom but I
hope you guys enjoyed today's video I
