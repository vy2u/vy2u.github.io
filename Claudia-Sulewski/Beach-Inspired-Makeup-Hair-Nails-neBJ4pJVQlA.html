grabbing my favorite face primer from
benefit and just rubbing it all over my
face and blending it in with my fingers
this will ensure to keep my face makeup
staying on all day and not sweating off
after that I'm grabbing my favorite
concealer from amazing cosmetics and
covering up my under-eye circles as well
as any blemishes that I have I'm going
to be skipping in my foundation today
and going straight for sunscreen this is
the coulomb mineral face sunscreen with
SPF 20 it's also tinted so it will help
to cover up any red patches that you
have on your skin so I just apply with
my fingers and blend it out with a brush
and this product is made with natural
ingredients and it's great for wearing
every day and then after that I'm just
going to set my face with some powder
and apply on a little bit of bronzer
it's very important to prime your eyes
before you apply on any eyeshadow to
make sure that your eyeshadow stays on
all day then grabbing a light brown
eyeshadow I'm going to apply it into my
crease to use as a background shade
where all of the eyeshadows will be
blending into and I'm also going to
apply this on my lower lash line
now I'm going in with my BH Cosmetics
California collection eyeshadow palette
and grabbing the shade at Malibu with a
flat shader brush I'm going to apply
this all over my lids these eyeshadows
are highly pigmented and are perfect for
the summertime after that I'm grabbing
San Francisco with a crease brush and
I'm going to apply this on the outer
corners of my eyes as well as in my
crease make sure to blend everything out
now grabbing an eyeshadow that is
slightly lighter than my skin tone I'm
going to highlight my brow bone as well
as my inner crease going back to my BH
Cosmetics palette I'm grabbing the shade
Hollywood with an angled brush and apply
Masson my lower waterline now since I
have green eyes at contrast perfectly
with the purple and makes my eyes pop
for my upper lash line I'm going to be
using my benefit waterproof eyeliner and
just making a thin line on my upper lash
line and it was very hard to do this
with one hand while holding the mirror
so I didn't get much footage of them
doing it but you guys will see how it
turns out right now I also decided to
use my benefit waterproof mascara
because when it's really hot outside
it's very easy for mascara to run and
start melting down your face and we
don't want that
I wanted to go bright with my lip color
today so I'm using my pop pouty pop
crayon in the shade a coil crush and
this stuff is extra nourishing but it is
highly pigmented so it's perfect for the
summertime and it's also long-lasting so
you don't have to keep on applying it's
summertime so I'm going to take off my
dark depressing nail polish and I plan
something a little brighter so for my
nail polish I'm using at my nail tini
and nail polish in the shade at my tie
and it's kind of like a bright almost
Coralie red so it's super fun for
summertime so I just have to apply on
two coats to all of my nails
before I do anything to my hair I always
like to brush it to make sure that I
have no nuts today I'm going to be using
my hot tools a large clipless styling
wand so I'm just going to grab random
sections of hair and just start curling
them you can also vary the amount of
hair that you grab each time it to make
it look a little bit more natural
after I curl each side I like to brush
out the curls to separate them out
I'm gonna skip the hairspray and use my
healthy sexy hair Beach spray and this
stuff helps to nourish and protect and
heal hair from the damage of Sun and
heat so all I do is just spray it in my
hair and scrunch it out I want to show
you guys a before and after shot of what
we spray does to your hair so you can
see it just makes it look like you spent
your day at the beach and it just looks
a little bit more messy and kind of
natural looking so I love the way the
spray looks and since the bottle is so
small it's perfect to put into your
beach bag or purse or anywhere with you
we have one last step which is perfume
of course and I'm using the salt air
roll-on a perfume oil from Demeter and
this stuff is great for on-the-go
because it is so small so I just like to
roll it on my wrists as well as the back
of my neck
this roll-on oil is not too overpowering
and it smells very fresh so it's perfect
for the beach so this is my completed
look I hope you guys enjoyed it and I'll
talk to you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
