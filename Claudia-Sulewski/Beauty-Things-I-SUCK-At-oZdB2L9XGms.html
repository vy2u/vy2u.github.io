so recently it strawberry electric 48
tags me to do the beauty things that I
suck at tag and I really want to do this
because I feel like a lot of the times
Beauty girls are portrayed as being
perfect at hair and makeup in fashion
and all that stuff so I thought this
would be kind of a fun video to do and
you guys can see how many things I
actually suck at so I made a little list
on my get down notepad so I'm just
gonna start reading off first one is
winged eyeliner this for sure is the
number one thing that I suck at most I
could not perfect winged eyeliner for
the life of me either I will do really
really good on one eye and then I just I
can't do the other eye I can never make
it look perfectly symmetrical and
perfectly like aligned or I just try to
do like a really dramatic winged
eyeliner look and it just it doesn't
work out for either eyes it's not good
the next thing that I suck at has to do
with my nails now I'm a pretty good nail
painter I think when I paint my nails it
looks pretty good on both hands it's
pretty much like perfect I don't really
get messy or anything
but what I suck at is taking care of my
nails literally like I don't know why
but I just never care about how my nails
look and it's disgusting because here
like I will see them up and show you
guys what my nails look like right now
and it doesn't even bother me that's
like what scares me like I wish I was
one of those people that would paint
their nails like a few times every
single week and you know fix it up when
you get some chips or just take it off
and do new nail color but I I just I
don't care and it sucks because I wish I
did and every single time I do pin my
nails I always always mess them up
because I'm so impatient I hate waiting
for my nails to dry so I always just end
up painting them and then I just try to
blow dry them and then I do other things
and I always just somehow end up
smudging them at least like three nails
at least so it's just I just get really
frustrated with painting my nails so
that's why I my nails always look so so
so bad the next one which I feel like is
kind of common with things that beauty
girls suck at which is smoky eyes I
maybe I don't have the eye shape for it
or something but every single time I try
to achieve some sort of smoky eye I just
end up looking like a hooker like I'm
not even kidding
it'll just be way too high up or
something I just I can't get that like
pointed shape dude I mean like every
time I put dark colors in my crease I
just do like the soft kind of like a
round faded look I can never like do
like the whole tape thing and then like
you know do that and take the tape off
and have like that kind of you know can
i smoky eye look I can't do that the
next one is kind of pathetic because you
would think that I would be good at this
but I suck and doing other people's
makeup like normally beauty girls like
you know they'll make videos of like
doing everyone's makeup before dances
and stuff like that but I just I can't
do other people's makeup because you
know everyone has different eye shapes
I'm just so used to working on my eye
shape so when I try to do other people's
eyes I just I can't do it I feel like I
also just get really nervous because I
feel like they won't like it and then
that just makes me do worse so I just I
can't do other people's makeup No
so my next two things that I suck it
have to do with hair
the first one is braiding I can never
ever do French braids I know how to do
it I know like you take the pieces you
take one from this side and like
incorporate it into the braid like I
understand how to French braid but I
just can't do it because I I get to like
here and then at this point I can't see
what I'm doing I'll try to use like a
mirror behind me and then just at that
point my arms hurt I think that's the
problem my arms just gets so tired of
holding them up here that I just I can
never finish it and then I just get
really mad at myself and I'll try and
I've I have never ever finished or
completed a French braid like I've gone
the most I've gone is like halfway and
then I just quit so um and I can't
French braid other people Oh God
can't do that either the next thing that
I suck at that's related to hair is
teasing my hair and sometimes in videos
my hair will look kind of you know
volumous and stuff like that but
literally all I do is just like go like
this and then and then I start talking
but like when it comes to actually
teasing my hair for like going to hang
out and stuff I can't do it I don't know
why like I just I think it's my hair
because my hair is so flat and thin if I
try like taking a brush and like back
combing it it will just look super super
naughty a bunch of knots will get
tangled up here and it just it never
works out it just falls flat within like
10 minutes and then I just have a bunch
of knots that I have to brush out at the
end of the day so yeah like I've tried
using hair spray and all that but I just
I can't tease my hair and I hate it
because my hair is so flat so I have to
go like this literally for like all my
YouTube videos this is what I do I could
do this like well I'm sleeping coz I'm
so used to like going like that so the
next one doesn't really have to do with
hair or makeup but I feel like this one
is appropriate to put in this video and
this has to do with like fashion and
clothing
um I suck at keeping my closet clean
don't get me wrong I love cleaning my
closet I don't know why I just really
like having a very you know clean
organized closet where everything is you
know perfectly in place and stuff so I
usually clean my closet every weekends
like a deep clean make sure everything
is literally perfect
but when it comes to like everyday
during the week and stuff I cannot keep
my closet clean by the time it's the end
of the week right before I like have to
clean it it is a complete mess Hey
folding clothes I hate putting them on
hangers I just everything ends up on the
floor usually in my bathroom too cuz
when I'm like taking a shower and I just
like throw my clothes on the ground they
just kind of like a pile just starts
getting bigger and bigger every single
day and
just close our everywhere especially
when I'm trying to pick an outfit for
school because usually I choose my
outfits in the morning instead of the
night before so when I'm really late I'm
like freaking out pulling out all my
clothes so they just end up everywhere
in my entire room so that is one of the
biggest struggles in my life is keeping
my closet clean because it never ever
works so I have to do like a deep clean
and like really clean everything out
every week now the last beauty thing
that I suck at is self-tanner now I am
pretty good when it comes to putting
salt an ER like on my face and on my
body like my legs my arm my back I have
mastered the whole back thing like
putting lotion on the back I don't know
how I like somehow get it it works I
don't know but the thing that I suck at
when it comes to Saul tanner is my neck
and I don't know why that is the only
thing I problems and I specifically
chose this one to be my last one just
because in case you guys can see it
right now I didn't want it you want you
guys like stare at it throughout the
entire video I will seam up on my neck
in just a second so you guys can see cuz
it's kind of noticeable right now um but
for some reason like I'll put Tanglin on
and it will look fine you know it'll
look okay because I have the tangle
ocean that's super dark so you can see
it right away it's not like the white
one that turns orange the next day you
know so what I'm like putting it on like
it looks fine and then once this all
tanner dries it's just so Watchi like it
gets clumped in certain areas I think
it's because when I'm like moving my
head around and stuff and like your neck
has like you know like the creases I
guess I don't I don't really know um but
I just it never ever I've never put Tang
lotion on my neck before with it being
completely perfect the next day like it
just it doesn't happen for me um so now
I'm gonna zoom up and show you guys how
beautiful my neck 10 is hopefully you
guys can see that right there but I've
been trying to scrub this off all
morning and I just can't get rid of it
and I tried covering up and it just it
didn't work so
hmm yeah so you don't really notice it
from far away so you know we're all good
um but that is everything for my beauty
things I suck at tag I think my hair
just is so naughty right here um so yeah
I hope you guys enjoyed today's tag
video I had a lot of fun filming it for
you guys
and let me know what you guys suck at
you know let's just let's just talk
about all the beauty and fashion and
hair things that we suck it so I hope
you guys enjoyed today's video and I
will talk to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
