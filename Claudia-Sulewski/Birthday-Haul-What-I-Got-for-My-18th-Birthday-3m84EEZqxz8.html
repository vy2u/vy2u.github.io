it's been 12 days I think since I posted
a video so I apologize about that but
today I wanted to film my birthday haul
so I'm just gonna be showing you guys
the things that my family got me this
video might not be very entertaining but
it was very requested so I wanted to
film it for you guys and in case any of
you guys wondering if my birthday was on
February 19th and I turned 18 years old
so I'm officially Vega alright also
before I start showing you guys the
things that I got I also want to say
that I've been wanting some of these
things for a very long time so I was
very happy and yeah let's get into it
I'll start off with the biggest one at
which is a new suitcase the suitcase I
got is from the brand that has a red
square with a plus whatever that brand
is and it's a medium sized suitcase
because I have one of those big ones
that could fit like a dead body in it
and I also had like a smaller one but I
did not have a medium sized one for like
playlist live which is coming up next
month Curtis in general any like trips
and stuff so I really needed a medium
sized suitcase and this one is really
nice it's all black it's got the four
spinning wheels on the bottom so it's
everything I can ask for and I'm very
happy about it the next thing that I got
from my family are some Tory Burch
flip-flops because I don't own any like
regular rubber flip-flops and I'm going
to Florida two separate times next month
I'm going to the Marco Island from March
2nd to the 8th with my family so these
are gonna come in great use because like
I said I don't know any flip-flops and
also playlist live
so I just got the black simple rubbery
flip-flops that have the gold Tory Burch
sign in the middle on the top so they're
very simple but this is exactly what I
wanted so I'm very very happy about
these and
I love them so much I get excited about
the weirdest things guys the next
present that I got was a Polaroid camera
and I feel like everyone and their
mother has these nowadays and I didn't
have one so my mom bought me one from
Urban Outfitters but she bought it in
white and it's really pretty I already
used up a bunch for a birthday party
that I had a few nights ago so that was
really fun but I'm really really happy
about this and I'm very excited to start
taking my parts I definitely feel like I
got way too excited for this next gift
but I got socks
which is great because no one ever buys
socks so that when you get them you just
you appreciate them more so I got just
some simple like super low-cut socks
that you can wear it with like flats or
boots that have cutouts on them or
anything like that so I've got some
white ones and some skin colored ones
I'm stocked up on my socks I think my
mom used wax paper as issue paper any
last thing that I got for my birthday
from my family was definitely the most
special gift that I got this year and it
was from Tiffany &amp;amp; Co and I was not
expecting this at all when I saw the
little teal bag come into the room I got
really excited but for my 18th birthday
my family decided that they want to buy
me at my first diamond necklace so I'm
actually wearing it on my neck right now
it's a very just simple diamond necklace
on a silver chain but if any of you guys
are curious on the color wheel of
diamonds it is the J diamond and it's so
beautiful when it hits the Sun it just
sparkles so much and I'm so happy that I
have a necklace that I could wear every
single day because pretty much all the
necklaces I own are just very like well
BAM out there doesn't really match with
every single outfit I wear and since
this one is very plain and simple I will
be wearing it every single day they just
overdid it I
oh my gosh I love it so much so that is
everything that I got from my 18th
birthday from my family and I did get a
few things for my friends but I didn't
want to show that stuff because some of
them are in the process of like being
shipped over someone else is like in the
process of making my gift so it was just
kind of like all over the place so I
just want to show you guys what I got
from my family so once again I'm very
thankful for everything that I got
because I know that a lot of these
things are very expensive
they definitely bought me things that
will come into great use and it's just
like the things that you don't normally
buy for yourself so when you get them
you get all excited and stuff so that is
actually it for today's video I know it
was very short and not as exciting as
you probably hoped it would be but I
just want to film this video to get
something up just to say hi to you guys
because I missed you guys I feel like I
haven't done so long
so also be sure to leave video requests
in the downbar because I've been writing
out a list of future video ideas that I
want to do within the next few weeks
so be sure to comment down any requests
that you guys have down below also be
sure to give this video a big thumbs up
for me being a hashtag legal and I'll
talk to you all later bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
