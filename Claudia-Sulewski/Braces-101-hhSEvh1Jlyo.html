haven't made a video in forever I'm not
gonna really go ahead and see a bunch of
excuses because you know what I have
none okay um so many of you know that um
I got braces yeah um and basically a lot
of you have been asking Claudia do they
hurt I'm getting on like I'm scared like
how do you take care of them like how
did they put it on like all that junk so
today I'm going to be making a video
specially um for braces so for anyone
who's going to have braces this is the
video that you want to watch and if
you've already had them or you're not
going to have them then I don't think
this video is really going to come and
need to you but um yeah so basically the
first thing on to talk about is the
process of getting them on um honestly I
almost fell asleep when they were
putting it on me like it didn't hurt at
all but um what I definitely recommend
and what I did was half an hour before
the appointment I took two like real
stress not stress oops
like pain reliever pills um so that when
they put it on it won't hurt and a
little bit after it like it won't hurt
you know so you take it like about half
an hour before the appointment so that
you know the pill or the pills or
whatever you take the medicine like
really sets in starts working um and
basically all they do is like they open
up your mouth and lie like glue them on
and all that junk and um I got like uber
rubber bands cuz we get to get like the
little colorful ones but um yeah it's I
like legit almost fell asleep while they
were putting it on like I just think
that the process of getting them on it
doesn't really hurt because there's kind
of gluing it on you know just the days
after that is what it starts chart
because your teeth are not
used to that you know um so it doesn't
hurt like when you get them on the first
day like maybe like an hour later it
will start hurting for me well actually
a lot of people say like when they get
their braces it hurts for weeks like two
weeks it it kind of depends on what kind
of person you are um like it honestly
hurt for like three days there's
something at the most three days like to
the point where it's like I can't eat
anything hard because it will like hurt
like my back teeth mostly hurt um so
look at the most was three days I
remember like the second like the day
after that was the worst
you have no idea I was like oh I get her
without me doing anything that sucked
um it didn't hurt that much the first
day it just kind of hurt towards the end
and then the fell like the day after the
day after so like the third day or
whatever it started to go away which is
really nice and um also another thing is
I don't know because last time I got
braces that this didn't happen to me but
I don't know why it happened to me this
time basically what happens is because
you know obviously these are metal you
know um and they like even still
nowadays like when I talk it scrapes the
inside of like my cheeks and like my
lips which is really annoying and it
kind of hurts and I'm getting used to
now because after a while you're like
skin like gets you stone you won't feel
it so I definitely recommend putting on
wax especially if you have any sharp
edges they'll get you like low wax or
hold on actually got some
and I'll give me off
yeah hi
just come inside through the side door
making a video right now so when you
come in just like sit on my bed I know
John is coming mm-hmm
okay so they give me like this little
like thing with a bunch of stuff and
this is what wax I'm talking about it's
not like legit like wax for like what or
whatever but in its meant orthodontic
the donek wax and it just looks like
that I didn't have to use any but um
they're just like that and you just kind
of put it wherever like it's really
irritating you and I definitely
recommend that
asteroth Adonis feel like hey do you
have any waxed it's like really poking
me or whatever and I'm sure they're
gonna have some of those um I'm sure
sorry you're like totally hesitated
there all right so another question that
people ask me so yeah that was like the
process of it and that was like how it
hurts or just hurts if you cup the first
few a couple days and now I'm going to
talk about how to take care of them now
I brush my teeth twice a day I don't do
it three times like I don't I'm not one
of those people I just do it morning
night morning night and they actually
gave me a electric toothbrush that's
really amazing hi Joanna
and um so this is how it looks I think I
still have the box all right um I don't
have the box but it's an oral-b
toothbrush and it looks like this and
it's really awesome because I'm making a
braces video but um oh my god okay
that's little wet it totally just pour
it all over me
okay so this is like the little charging
station and it comes with four heads and
you get two of these which is like the
main one and two of these which are like
the mini ones
you just kind of have it in here the
toothbrush itself goes in here and
charges like that it has like a little
thing I'm about to tell you the battery
life and the great thing about this
toothbrush and what it really recommends
getting it for if you have braces
because it comes with a mini like little
timer that says the time when it's
exactly 1 o'clock right now and the
thing is watch this right when you turn
it on it starts um like showing that it
brushes and when you pause it it just
pauses and this thing goes all the way
around and after 2 minutes there's like
a little smiley face right there and
then also watch this this is for the
gums and that's like for polishing and
stuff and it just looks like that and
then once you like turn your toothbrush
off for a long time they'll switch back
to like the actual time and this back
comes off and you can the sticker comes
with it you can stick it on your mirror
or whatever and slide it on and then
slide it off so this is like really
really great um
so definitely recommend this toothbrush
the toothpaste that I use they also gave
me it was just like the crest ProHealth
night toothpaste and it looks like that
and they also gave me like the matching
um mouthwash and I thought this is like
for a night or whatever but I usually
just I don't really use this during
night time I use during the morning just
like to freshen up my breath for the
rest of the day but um
it's supposed to like cleaner mouth in
the morning so when you use it at
nighttime like you won't have that bad a
breath Sonia sleepovers that's pretty
great so yeah I really recommend taking
care of your teeth like as much as you
can't lean your braces because once you
get them off if you don't treat them
like how you're supposed to you will
regret it so much you'll have permanent
like white stains everywhere it will
look pretty um so just make sure that
you take care of them really well like
as if they were like a newborn baby um
they say like brush your teeth after
every single time you eat I eat a lot
during the day and that is I can't
imagine time to brush my teeth like 20
times a day so just at least do it twice
for two minutes or whatever and make
sure to floss I know dentists and
orthodontists always stress about how
much you have to floss but it's actually
pretty important and it's kind of messed
up having to like floss with braces but
um yeah just kind of to deal with it
it's really weird you have to like take
the floss and like get it through the
wire and then do it I don't like it but
um oops I got do it so I'm like dropping
everything in here
um but yeah that's all that that's
basically um everything I have to say
about braces like the process if it
hurts how to take care of them um and
yeah that's basically it so if you guys
have any more questions about braces
then just kind of below or you can
message me or whatever and anyone who
has braces even you can like help people
by commenting to them or whatever and
yeah so that's it for today's video I
hope this helps some of you guys they're
going to have braces or already have it
and I'll see you guys there bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
