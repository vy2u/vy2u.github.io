got my braces off last week and I was so
excited because I've had them on for a
good like two years so I was so ready to
get them off and I finally did and I'm
so happy
II um so today I'm going to be doing a
video all about kind of my braces
experience and just kind of me s
answering a bunch of your guys's
questions that you have been asking to
me about braces so I read I wrote down a
bunch of little stuff that I'm going to
talk about so I'm just going to get
right into it
um but yeah that's on my teeth but I'm
so happy okay
so first I'm going to share my story
with you guys before I got braces or any
of that stuff I had an expander which is
basically this little metal contraption
that is at the top of your mouth and
basically you turn this little key thing
every night and it's supposed to expand
your teeth I don't know I had that for
like a good couple months or year I
really don't remember
and then in fourth grade I got braces
for the first time so yes I did get
braces twice and I don't know why I'm a
big put braces on my teeth while I still
had my baby teeth which was not as my
idea I don't know why my orthodontist
did that I almost like think it was just
to get the money from us but I got them
on at fourth grade while I still had
some of my baby teeth in and I had them
on for like a year and a half I don't
remember but I had them on and then I
got them off because my baby teeth were
falling out and my adult teeth were
going in and then once all my adult
teeth grew in um they grew in all
crooked and I had this like vampire
tooth that was sticking out you guys
have probably seen it in a bunch of my
videos um and then yeah I got braces I
think it was in seventh grade I'm really
sure but I got braces on for the second
time and then I had them on for I think
two years and now I have them off and I
got them off last Wednesday so that's
kind of my story for you guys I did get
them on twice which really stinks so if
head braces for a good like four years
total if you didn't separate them but
yeah that is my story
so now let's talk about getting your
braces on in my opinion it doesn't hurt
at all it didn't take too long either
all they really did was clean up your
teeth a little bit put some glue on them
they put the little metal things on put
the wire through put on your rubber
bands and you're good the actual
procedure didn't take too long it didn't
hurt that bad so you shouldn't worry
about that but it does hurt that day and
for a couple days afterwards um so some
people it doesn't hurt but to a lot of
people it kills for me I don't really
remember I think it did hurt for a good
like two or three days after getting my
braces on just because your teeth aren't
used to it it also feels really weird
you kind of feel like your lips are like
sticking out more because you know you
have the braces coming your teeth so it
does kind of feel different and it will
hurt your teeth just because your teeth
obviously aren't used to it and the
braces are starting to move them around
so that will hurt for like a couple of
days my only advice will probably be is
just to eat a lot ice cream or anything
cold that's going to help the pain go
away and also if it really hurts that
bad then you can just take Advil or
anything like that I'd say for me my
teeth didn't hurt as much as the inside
of my cheeks hurt because like what
would happen is the braces like the
inside of my lips and just like my teeth
in general just set skin right there in
the inside of your mouth it wasn't used
to braces so the metal would scratch on
it you're talking or eating and stuff
and I have a bunch of scars like in the
inside of my cheeks because of my braces
like you can't see them but you can feel
them with your tongue and that's just
because sometimes there'd be a wire that
would poke it use every time you talk
you like feel it scratching so that's
what I hurt more for me when I first got
my braces than my actual teeth other
than that it's not too bad it just feels
really weird and you're just not going
to be used to it um so your teeth will
hurt for a couple days and you might
have some like pointing and kind of
irritation like in the inside of your
mouth but other than that the process of
getting them
on is very fast and simple and it's not
really that big of deal
so now I'm going to talk about the time
period between getting them on and
getting them off so for me braces really
didn't bother me you get used to them
and they just become a part of your
daily life the only thing that really
did bother me was um you know whenever I
would go to the ortho and they would
change up the wires sometimes they
wouldn't cut it short enough in the back
and he would you know like poke at my
cheeks but other than that um it wasn't
really too bad it's not like it hurt
every single day it really doesn't hurt
people so it's not really that big of a
deal you know the longer you have them
on the more you just get used to them
and it just just forget about it you
know the only other thing that I have
written down here is rubber bands and if
you have an underbite or an overbite or
if your jaw isn't like aligned or
whatever they will make you wear rubber
bands it's always different for everyone
um rubber bands are basically your
braces sometimes they'll have hooks on
them and they'll make you like hook on a
rubber band from like the top to bottom
or whatever on both sides one side it's
just kind of to help you like align your
jaw and fix your overbite or underbite
or whatever you have those hurt okay
they hurt for the first like couple days
but then once you keep wearing them it
doesn't get like bad at all when you're
ortho tells you you need to wear rubber
bands wear them because the more you
don't wear them the longer you're going
to have your braces on so if they tell
you you have to wear your rubber bands
all day every day except for when you
eat do it because um trust me like if
you want your braces off as soon as
possible you should listen to them I
never really had to wear rubber bands
that often only a couple times sometimes
it was only overnight and stuff and they
would hurt your teeth um like the first
couple days so I definitely recommend
taking some kind of pain reliever pills
rubber bands are only there to help you
and to help perfect your smile
so do not be a slacker when it comes to
those and wear them when you have to
wear them
so now I'm going to talk about taking
care of your braces and brushing your
teeth and kind of oral hygiene and stuff
like that so for me I would only brush
it my teeth twice a day which is normal
you know morning at night sometimes I
would brush it three times a day if you
come home after school and you're not
doing anything go brush your teeth it
will really help out also I've gotten
questions if it's okay to use the normal
toothbrush because some people think you
need to use those fancy high-tech like
mechanical toothbrushes no you don't I
did receive one from them a while back
but at one point like I was too lazy to
buy the little heads of the toothbrush
because they were expensive so I just
went back to using normal toothbrushes
and those worked fine for me it just it
doesn't really matter what toothbrush
you use just as long as you know you're
brushing your teeth for good at least
like what is it two minutes I don't know
but make sure you really brush your
teeth you don't just do it in ten
seconds and you're done with because
most likely you will not get all of the
plaque and gross junk in between your
teeth so make sure you brush your teeth
at least twice a day and if you can
three times is even better and also I
definitely recommend trying mouthwash if
you haven't just because you know your
braces get in the way from a bunch of
little areas on your teeth that you know
the bristles of the brush can't get in
between so since a mouthwash is liquid
it goes in every little crack and
crevices of your teeth mouthwash will
help kind of get take away the plaque
and all the germs and bacteria and stuff
in between the spots that can't really
reach with your toothbrush so definitely
mouthwash is a great way to keep your
teeth clean when you have braces on they
will give you a bunch of rules on what
you can and can't eat but personally I
didn't really follow them for example I
did chew gum I chew gum like every
single day and I've never had gum get
stuck in my braces or anything like that
um the only things that I would
recommend not eating is don't chew on
ice because a that's bad for your enamel
that's just bad for your teeth in
general but ice can
like dent the wire and hurt it just
because you know ice is really really
hard so don't bite ice because I know a
lot of people like to chew ice
what else I don't recommend biting into
apples so cut your apples into pieces
when you have when you want to eat them
just because that can break your brace
brackets off when you like bite into an
apple and also I think caramel just
really really chewy things Candy's fine
but I think caramel in my opinion like
can kind of mess up your braces so I
would never really eat caramel either
but as far as all the other rules it
doesn't really affect anything like I
never had any of my brackets or wires
dented or any of them come off or
anything like that I didn't really have
any problems with that so that is it for
taking care of your braces and brushing
your teeth and stuff like that I wasn't
too crazy young we brush them twice a
day just like a normal person and they
turned out fine so you know just make
sure that you're smart about and you're
not lazy with it so you'll be fine if
you follow those rules
so now let's talk about getting your
braces off so first I'm going to talk a
little bit about the procedure that they
do so what they do is they take a little
tool and they just kind of click
something I don't know what they do but
somehow they make the brackets pop off
well first off they take off your rubber
bands they take off
take out the wires and they pop off all
the brackets and then you have a bunch
of glue left on your teeth so then
they'll take I don't know if it was
metal I think it was metal entirely sure
but they take this like drill type of
thing that is really loud and they
basically scrape off the glue from you
know the surface of your teeth and then
they basically just buff out your teeth
rinse them with water and stuff like
that and then you are done with getting
your braces off so the process isn't too
long so I don't want to scare you guys
but okay so the first time when I had my
braces and I got them take it off it
didn't hurt whatsoever it was super
quick you know they took him off took
off the glue it was fine um didn't hurt
one bit but for some reason after
getting them off the second time it
hurts so bad and I don't want to scare
you guys but I don't want to lie to you
guys you know like taking them off for
like it kind of hurt when they snapped
off the brackets I didn't hurt that bad
but when they pull out that drill and
they started shaving away the glue I
don't know why maybe because it was the
second time my teeth had become more
sensitive but it hurt really really bad
because I feel like they were wearing
away like my teeth um I could the s and
them I'm like dude like are you like
chipping my teeth hurt so bad they're
like no no we're just getting glove but
for some reason it hurts so bad the
second time I was sitting there like
cringing because the drilling noise just
hurt my ears and I'm just I was just
sitting there like ah I don't know why
it hurt it was such a bad experience the
second time than it was the first time I
don't know why I don't want to scare you
guys I'm sorry that if I'm scaring guys
um I don't know why maybe my teeth are
really sensitive but it was just it
really did hurt for me the second time
um which is weird because it didn't hurt
all the first time but then when they
buffed your teeth and clean it that
didn't hurt or anything it was just the
drill like hurt my teeth I don't know
why so once you officially have your
braces off it didn't hurt at all they've
actually felt really cool because your
teeth felt really kind of slimy and
smooth and like really big too because
you know you weren't used to it and I
don't know it just feels really cool and
I used to love like licking my teeth now
like now I'm used to it but it felt
really cool and they didn't hurt at all
so that was good
so I just tweeted you guys if you have
any questions for me so now I'm just
going to be answering any questions that
you guys have tweeted to me I'll try to
answer at least a couple of them and
also I'm just going to answer some
frequently asked questions that I get so
the first one is what color rubber bands
do you normally get / which ones look
the best for me I don't know why I never
changed it I always got light blue for
some reason I thought like blue always
looked the best on me at least I tried
navy blue I tried pink
I tried green and teal and all that
stuff of some reason I mean I used to
try them when I was younger but I always
went back to light blue so I definitely
recommend getting like blue I don't know
why I thought it looked the prettiest I
don't know why I just always got like
blue is it hard to brush your teeth with
braces not really you just have to make
sure that you have to brush like kind of
tilted above the bracket and below the
bracket not like forward like you would
normally because that's not really going
to do too much um and you just get used
to it I don't know it's not only that
hard
the next question is were you scared
that you might get the teeny little
squares on your teeth yes I was
terrified that I would get those stains
on my teeth because my braces but I
didn't get them so as long as you take
good care of your teeth you brush in the
least twice a day you'll be fine because
I don't have them and just as long as
you take good care of them at least
decent care for them then I'm sure you
will be fine what's the best thing to do
if I want to whiten my teeth when I get
them off you can always try a crest
strips like whitening crest strips I
hear the 3d professional effects ones
are really good I actually tried a
sample of those not a while ago like a
few days ago because I had a sample from
Ulta and they didn't hurt my teeth at
all I don't know if they affected it
just because it was one time but you can
always try those or you can also
professionally get them done but I don't
want to do that just because I'm scared
it's going to be super sensitive on my
teeth because that's like a very strong
like percentage of like bleach so I
don't want to do that but you can always
try like whitening toothpastes and
whitening strips and just
stuff like that that you can find at the
drugstore why do people say it feels
slimy after braces are off does it
really yes it does I think it's just
because when they buff them out and just
clean them really well you're used to
feeling kind of like rigid metal braces
and once you get it off and you feel
like your real teeth they just feel
really smooth and slimy and I don't know
why that they just do and the feeling is
really cool so Oh No
so all the other questions that I'm
seeing from Twitter have all been
answered within this video so I'm just
going to stop here and end this video
before it gets too long I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and tell me what you
guys think about my teeth and that's it
okay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
