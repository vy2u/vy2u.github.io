for you guys what's up guys welcome back
to my channel
today's video is going to be a little
more casual just like last week's video
which by the way I quickly want to thank
you guys for your incredible feedback
you guys left these sweetest messages in
the entire world and it genuinely made
me so so happy I read through every
single one of them and you guys are just
freaking awesome but today's video is
also going to be pretty casual because I
don't have much time this week and so
apologies on that but I'm also excited
because I've only filmed this type of
video once before I'll have it linked
down below but it's basically going to
be a get ready with me but a little more
casual and chatty I'm going to be
talking through what I'm doing versus
chopping it up and adding in voiceover
and music and all that stuff I just
realized I didn't set my makeup so we're
gonna do that right now but that's so
out of order that's okay let's get into
it base for the face need to put
something on your face before you start
filling up your pores with makeup lately
I've been skipping primers and just
using lotion on my face I'm really
obsessed with the Clinique dramatically
different moisturizing lotion I was
supposed to get the gel Claudia I've
really been in love with the Clinique
dramatically different moisturizing gel
I like the lotion but only at nighttime
because I find that the gel just soaks
up into my skin a lot quicker and I
don't really want to wait for the lotion
to kind of sink in before doing my
makeup so this is a lot faster and I
like to mix this with some of the st.
Tropez self tan classic bronzing face
lotion I do this just to maintain some
sort of color in my skin because I like
to self tan a few pumps of the lotion a
few pumps of a self-tanner mix it
together you're ready to go so yeah
putting it all over my face like the
ears go will past the jawline guys look
at my mug
it's so cute I've also got some
blueberries off to the side so that's
the setup right now thanks Fred
foundation I've talked about this
foundation a million gajillion time
I'm still obsessed with it it's the make
up for ever ultra HD foundation stick
and I'm in the shade 125 I would say so
going in with my Beauty Blender I'm just
going to start blending everything in I
swear to god this stuff is like an
eraser it's so weird the second you
start blending it in everything just
disappears as of lately my skin has been
super clear I haven't really had too
many breakouts but normally I would go
in with the makeup forever concealer
palette you guys will notice that I use
a lot of makeup forever products this
video is not sponsored anyway yeah I
really like this concealer palette it is
the shade number one it's their
camouflage cream palettes I love all of
the shades I usually end up using all of
them but I'm going to use the second one
and just add a little bit under my eyes
to kind of cancel out my dark circles
but that's pretty much all I'm going to
do for concealer once I finished up with
all my cream products I'm going in and
setting my face with the Laura Mercier
translucent powder this stuff is
incredible this is probably my third
time purchasing this and it lasts a very
long time so I'm going in with the same
Beauty Blender that I've been using and
because I'm lazy and I'm just dipping a
little bit in there and I'm going to set
underneath my eyes I'm not totally
obsessed with the whole baking trend
that has been on YouTube for a while
sometimes I think it's a little too
intense and if you leave it on for too
long then you just look super washed out
and flash photography but I do like
having it on my under eyes just for a
little bit because it definitely helps
to like lock everything in so once I do
that I kind of use the rest and Pat it
on my forehead I'll go like a little on
my chin and then using a larger face
brush I'm just gonna go in and use that
powder I was under my eyes and just kind
of blend it and now for my favorite and
in my opinion the most crucial part
about doing makeup is the eyebrows it
changes everything it's the number one
thing that um I always have done
normally I use the benefit browsing
palette in shade number 5 because I have
pretty dark hair but lately I've been
using the makeup forever Pro sculpting
brow palette and guys
I am pretty damn impressed because this
little thing has so many different
shades and options I've only used this
thing twice so it's still super new to
me but so far I am loving it
one time I discovered this eyebrow brush
on set it is the Anastacio number 7 and
I'm so obsessed with it I love that it's
small it's got a spoolie and the angled
brush is just incredible for filling in
eyebrows so that is what I like to use
I'm just gonna go to town I usually
start off more towards the front at the
bottom and just kind of go in small
strokes you cannot rush this our
Halloween costume videos still a thing
like do you guys want to see that kind
of stuff this year but yeah last year I
had a lot of fun with my costume I made
this like deer makeup and I made little
like homemade antlers and more like a
cute dress with boots and stuff and I
got a lot of requests from you guys
asking if I could do a tutorial it was
already too late by then so if you guys
want me to do a tutorial on this look
right here let me know because I would
have so much fun recreating it for you
guys I thought it was so cute I've been
using this bronzer for so so long
because I love the shade of it I love
that there's no sparkles and also this
one in particular let's give it a little
zoom up real quick how cool is that
it says Claudia's who love shout out to
you benefit I feel really special every
time I use this so I'm just gonna go in
and contour my cheekbones my temples a
little bit down here and then go from
there
favorite chopstick in the entire world
the Nivea lip butter and cocoa butter
kiss oh my gosh I kind of feel like
having a little bit of fun with my eye
makeup usually I keep it very very
classic and neutral and I'll just throw
in like a topi brown or bronzey color
into my crease but I want to try out
this palette yet again another makeup
forever palette but this came in with
the eyebrow palette so that's why I'm
just really excited about these this is
our new 9 artist shadow palette and so
there are a lot of fall colors in here
so beautiful look at that bluey green
should I mess with that one are we gonna
get that freaky should we I might do it
I'm gonna start off with this lighter
gray toned Brown and I'm just gonna
throw that into my crease to start with
a nice gradual blending shadow I don't
know what the term is but it helps
everything else kind of blend in and
look a little more natural let's peel
this plastic off this is my first time
using this palette by the way I really
like that I do I'm a little scared I'm
not gonna lie alright we're gonna dip
into this greenish blue one
and just see what happens I'll saw where
my start
yo this is so pretty I'm excited now so
I'm just blending this in to the
previous shade oh yeah yeah I'm into
this I don't want to bring this all the
way in I think I'm gonna mess with this
gray color right here and add some on to
the outer half of my lid so we're going
to tap some of that on there and we're
gonna blend that I'm also going to take
some of that same gray and add that to
my lower lash line then also pop in some
of that blue green as well yeah I'm
definitely adding a little more of this
green in there I'm going to throw in a
little bit of this lighter shade it's
like a very very light nude tone and I'm
just gonna add it on the inside of my
eye right here and just blend it super
well and I'm just doing this to kind of
highlight this area and break apart the
dark colors now I'm going to highlight
my brow bone so I'm gonna refer back to
this smaller palette and just use the
little highlighter in here and I'm just
gonna go in right at the bottom
extremely close and kind of start
drawing a line I may have mentioned this
in a video before I'm not sure but I've
been Jesus it's another freaking pickup
from a product guys I swear this videos
and sponsored by them but I'm obsessed
with their Pro sculpting duo so you've
got a contouring shade and a highlight
shade so I never use this bottom half
for contouring because I feel that it's
a little too glittery for me although
I've been really loving it for blush
because it just gives you a very bronze
goddess II looking shine to your face
I'm going to go in and tone this down a
little bit I really like using this
highlighter it makes you super shiny and
glow like crazy but I have been obsessed
with a different highlighter lately I
don't think I've heard of anyone talk
about this on YouTube so that's kind of
exciting but it's by the brand thrive
Cosmetics and it is a cream highlighter
it definitely has more of a powder
finish to it it's not too sticky on your
face or anything and I definitely think
it's OK to apply on top of powder
products but on one end of the product
you've got the highlighter and I have
the shade joy which is so beautiful
it's on the Pinker side but it's got
like some gold in it I think and then on
the other side you've got a little brush
and you can actually take this brush off
if you want to like dab it into the
product and then kind of dab it on but I
like to use my fingers and then I'm just
gonna Pat it onto the tops of my
cheekbones ah it's so pretty it's such a
subtle shine but definitely is still
there I feel like it's not too much
it's not too little it's right in the
middle that rhymed I just realized I
didn't really talk about anything
besides the products in this video is
that how these videos usually go though
I feel like this might be interesting me
just talking about the products I have
no idea but I also like to dab it on my
Cupid's bow super important spot it just
makes your lips look a little more plump
and then tip it a nose I avoid the
bridge of the nose because then it just
looks a little a little too much maybe a
little on the chin I can dab some up
here because I'm feeling crazy almost
forgot the mascara I'm going to quickly
curl my lashes this is the tweezerman
eyelash curl for mascara I'm using the
benefit - they're real mascara this is
my second favorite one I'm obsessed with
their roller lash one but I want to
finish this before I start using a new
bottle the other one aah-ha
oh my god quick side story I sliced my
thumb the other day trying to open a
package and like it sliced all the way
down my nail off to the side and I just
put a lot of pressure on it okay weekend
weekend
oh yeah okay lastly we've got the lips
and almost but lately I haven't really
been wearing very many lip products I
usually just stop after chapstick for
the sake of this video I'll throw on a
little bit of this NYX butter gloss in
the shade fortune cookie it's just like
a new lip gloss I feel like it just
makes them a little bit lighter but yeah
let's let's take the hair down full
reveal okay I'm gonna get in a little
closer for you guys here's a closer look
at the makeup if you guys want to see I
just realize I skipped eyeliner today I
guess I wasn't feeling it I'm actually
super into this look I'm really feeling
it I really really like the I makeup
palette that I used today so I'm excited
to try out all these different shades oh
yeah let me know if you guys enjoyed
this casual video I'm so sorry that I've
been making videos that are all sit down
and easy to edit and stuff like that for
the past few weeks I've just been
traveling back and forth from New Mexico
