Rebecca all right I went amended really
early

something Nino annoyingly that will
happen where you'd hear something going
on up I know I'm coming since we're
coming from Ohio day the wind break is
sound like I thought someone was killing
a dog yeah I started imagining to myself
like what if I'm getting hurt like what
if this is happening if this is

dog this is a lady Lee this is a lady
