back to my channel we are so comfy cozy
on the couch right now and we've got
lovely camera assistant Liana in the
house you guys have been asking for a
tour of my place for so long I've lived
here for nearly a year and I'm finally
finishing up with the decorating and
final pieces this video is going to be
focusing on my closet tour how I
organize my clothing accessories shoes
all those things follow me let's go on
upstairs and go do this let's go do it
let's go it loaded if you I have this
little rack that I got from Ikea it's a
very simple stainless steel I just have
smells like my little backpacks and
everyday bags on here with a denim
jacket we've got this section over here
which faces my bed and basically I got
these they're technically all
bookshelves like you jump up into the
wall they're supposed to be floating but
I got these off of Craigslist which I'm
super Bravo because I got a great deal
on them I use them as storage for pretty
much like my everyday boots and then
also a bunch of my speakers that I
enjoyed wearing and then you can wear
this way this dresser I got from West
Elm obviously buy everything from like
Western and cb2
that's what you guys are going to be
hearing those stuff starting at the top
left drawer we've got PJ's shirts I like
to roll them because it's easier to see
them stack them all that stuff obviously
these drawers get a lot messier than
what you guys were seeing in the middle
drawer we've got a few more shirts some
little PJs shorts those are the
designated pj drawers and then the rest
are basically workout clothes so these
bottom two drawers have all of my
leggings from like my black casual ones
that i'll travel into my life
I'll work out in in this middle drawer
we have workout tops and then in this
top door we've got my sports bras so
yeah
casual things I feel like this is when
the lighting in the video starts to get
a little sketchy because we don't have
natural lighting especially when to go
into the main closet but in between my
closet and my bathroom we've got this
little middle area which I was so
excited about when I first moved here
because it's so cute so I guess I'll
start up here I have mostly sunglasses a
few hats thank you never where we always
like I've never seen you or not and I
was like that is right but I have them
here just in case I don't know what if I
go through a phase you never know you
know what that's a lie I've won these
set pools I've worn these at pools and
then up top I put all of my little
zipper compartments and travel baggies
and stuff for toiletries we've got a
nice little marble top counter with some
more drawers so up here obviously I have
all my jewelry which is great because
it's right in between like where I'm
getting dressed and where I'm like
brushing my teeth and stuff so it's a
great kind of like last stop I got most
of these like little black felt things
yeah all of them actually from Michael's
apart from the necklace rack which is
from Umbra and it's great because I have
a lot of like long necklaces and stuff
moving on over to the actual closet so
if you guys have been watching me since
my last place or if you've seen my
previous closet or I was accustomed to a
lot of space I became very used to
having a very absurd amount of closet
space that no one needs to have it was
unreal this one's definitely smaller
than that one but I feel like I've done
a really great job at utilizing all the
space that I have and really kind of
like organizing it in a way that works
for me so I guess we'll start with a
door this is kind of like the newest
piece in my closet organization I don't
really know what to put in here yet but
I just know eventually there will be
things that need to be in here so at the
moment I just have oh I didn't even go
down here let's backtrack back here
we've got a bunch of purses almost
forgot about that but anyways so
the clutch up here randomly but I need
to figure out what to put in here love
having the hamper down here because
although I do have my main larger hamper
in my bathroom this one's really nice
when I'm just like being out changing I
see a shirt that's dirty I throw it in
here so now giving you guys a full look
into the closet as you can see it's
pretty filled up but there is definitely
kind of a system we have going on here
as far as like what came with this unit
or like this closet already the things
that I added are mostly on this wall as
well as these like separate bins which I
have two of there's one like farther
down up top as you can see I just have a
bunch of bins these first two are
overflowing with swimsuits so that's
where I have those I just chuck them
down go through threw out anything in
there it there's no way to like organize
swimsuits any other way I've got some
shoes up there that I still need to try
on wearing stuff and then all across
here we've mostly got like packing cubes
little like dust bags from purses kind
of like those random things that you
feel like you should just own and not
throw out so then starting here
obviously I still have a lot of open
space I eventually might get like some
more bins to have or something but right
now I don't have anything to fill it up
with which is great because you know
she's filling up quick you know what I
mean so this is nice but up here we've
got my skirts I used to hang them but I
don't really wear skirts that often so I
found that it's easier just to fold them
up here so I've got like my denim skirts
here and the more material athletic
colorful ones to the right right here
this is like such a pointless track and
Lyanna made fun of me boy these are just
two tops that I'm too lazy to like hang
on hangers so I'm just laying them here
but I'd wear tube tops a lot here we've
got some of like my nicer sweatshirts
and zip up sweatshirts you guys will see
that I fold my hoodies but here we have
you know like your knit sweater it's
your classic zip up so I don't really
have too many so I found this was like a
good little corner for them I got this
little organizer thing from the
Container Store that's where I got this
thing as well everything organizational
wise I pretty much get from the
Container Store I keep my socks in here
because it's easy to reach for and just
dump them in here underwear in this one
bra let's and bras and then
intimate items going across this way
here we have all my this what are you
doing here sir as you can see all of my
shirts are here I do color code I know
that sounds insane
some people might think it's hard to
maintain but it actually isn't I used to
try to like separate them by types of
clothing like having like bra let's crop
tops sleeveless short sleeve long sleeve
and that was just too hard color is so
much easier - I guess categorize and be
able to like pick out basically I just
have an assortment of crop tops tank
tops body suits short sleeve shirts
stuff like that my blouses and kind of
baggy or bigger long sleeve shirts we've
got some flannels back here so here we
just kind of have like the thicker
pieces then moving on down here this is
one of my favorites little categories
because I love a good jacket these are
kind of like my lighter jackets I'll
show you guys my coat closet downstairs
that has like the thicker ones but these
are kind of the fun ones that I like to
pull out when I'm going out and stuff as
you guys can see I have the same a
little organizer back here as well but
basically here I've just got all of my
shorts because I like to just kind of
throw them in here and then down here
I've just got some like knee-high boots
and stockings and tights we've got this
metal shoe rack also from Container
Store I believe yes I've got kind of
like my fancier shoes here that I'm not
really reaching me fancier shoes um well
like the ones that I'm not grabbing for
as much as the ones out there little
wedges little platforms heels all those
things and yeah this is great visually
pleasing this is pretty new to my closet
as well I got this around the same time
I got the door thing I decided to have
my jeans kind of folded I used to hang
them over hangers and hang them like
that I realized that I just got lazy
with hanging and it just really wasn't
working out I find this to be so much
easier these are all separate shelves
that I also got from Container Store and
they're stackable so it's not like going
anywhere it's pretty secure down here
we've got some more sneakers that I
don't reach for normally but I have them
just in case and so I
also using that little area right there
moving on to this back wall I have a
little brown box right there back from
when I first moved here I just never
unboxed it but basically I have all of
my skiing tires of snow pants winter
coats scarves gloves skiing goggles all
those things up here we've got a duffel
bag or this is actually a gym bag from
Lululemon I like to use this to travel a
lot I'm constantly grabbing this I just
kind of don't there I'm sweating it's
like hi and I'm talking a lot okay good
morning up here we've got some eggs
honestly never really wear those unless
I'm traveling somewhere cold then this
top rack also similar to the jeans isn't
always this perfectly folded because I
mean it's the same thing with like just
like fully so if hansen hoodies
literally wear a human I could list 20
things I'd rather be doing than folding
up hoodies you know what I mean but as
you guys can see I just throw all my
hoodies and sweatpants up here this back
section over here kind of has more of
like my fancier pieces for starters I
bought this little belt hanger best
decision of my life
I don't even know what I was doing with
my belts before I got this but I think
this was also the container store and
basically it's just a hanger it's got a
bunch of little hooks and you just hang
all of the belts on it next to that I've
got all my pants that aren't jeans so
these I'm fine with hanging because I'm
not wearing them as much as my jeans
full pants to go out in some pants to
you know pop around in love a pop love a
bot love a good pop I don't really have
an organization process here I just kind
of throw whenever I get any pieces but
this is where I keep like my dresses my
fancier pieces all my like little
sundresses and stuff and yeah it just
continues all the way to the wall and
that is how it organized this closet
downstairs I have this coat closet that
is like immediately to my right when you
I'm sorry together air conditioning the
event things right there and it's real
of um I didn't really like prep this for
video of clothing irons it's called hot
iron flat no that's for your hair uh
yeah a click yeah why are we why is this
a clothing yeah a clothing iron and iron
and I need an iron every time we say
iron can you put a picture of your iron
smoko is a screen but yeah I mostly keep
a lot of bickering jackets here we've
got you know the crazy fur jackets of
course well I meant um boxing never get
rid of it because when you move taking a
big computer it's like hard it's not you
should just do that I'm just done so I'm
just dragging video and seeing me

closet or I hope you guys enjoyed it
