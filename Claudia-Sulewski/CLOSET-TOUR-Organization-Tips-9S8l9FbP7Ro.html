be doing a closet tour somebody showing
you guys how I like to organize all of
my clothes and choose a little bit of my
jewelry as well and while I show you
guys around my closet I'm also going to
be talking about the different tips and
techniques that I like to store
different ways to kind of optimize the
space that you have while making it look
cute at the same time I love organizing
and cleaning things I don't know why but
it just gives me joy so I am very
excited to film this video for you guys
so when you walk into my half of the
apartment you go into this little
hallway so you could see a little bit of
my room and I've got two closets on both
sides of the little hallway on the right
side is the larger walk-in closet I'm so
thankful to have a walk-in closet
because it's the perfect amount of space
for all the clothes that I have and then
on the left side of the mini hallway
you've got a smaller one that's good for
linens and other end of things but I
also turned it into a clothing closet so
we're going to start off with what is in
the larger closet because that is where
the majority of my clothes are for
starters the hangers that I use are
those black velvet like fuzzy thin
hangers I don't know why but I cannot
have different colored hangers I like to
have all my angers the same color
because I just think it looks neat and
it looks nice and sleek and classic
they're super thin as well so they help
to save a lot of space and also the
shirts don't slip off because they kind
of grip onto the fuzz
so I 100% recommend getting those
hangers I hang a lot of my clothes so I
have all my flannels and shirts wrappers
and dresses that is pretty much all the
things that I love to hang so starting
on the left side I have all my flannels
and kind
longer sleeve shirts I don't have a lot
with me here in California but that is
where I keep them on the left side and
then also you guys may notice that I
like to organize my tops by the length
of them because I do keep a few things
underneath my shirts on the shelf I
don't really do it by color or anything
I just kind of throw the shirts in after
I use them in wherever they you know
would fit with my length pattern I don't
know I'm trying to say you guys known a
frenzy so that's kind of the way that
I've been hanging all of my shirts and
flannels and it's been going pretty well
I've been enjoying it and it's pretty
easy to maintain so I like what I've
been doing there and then also you guys
will notice that at the top of my closet
I have kind of like white wire metal
shelving and that was actually already
in the closet when I moved in so on top
there I've got two baskets on the top
left the one on the most left is where
all my bathing suits are I brought a lot
of bathing suits with me next to it I've
got a bin and that's where I keep all of
my sports bras sports shorts and any
tank tops I like to work out and so
basically any workout clothing it's
super easy for me to just take the bin
down and throw the stuff in there and
then prop it up top so I really like
storing those two categories up there
then when you move to the right I've got
random boxes and shoe boxes those are
kind of miscellaneous things but I just
needed a place to keep them and then on
the right side I've got all my sweaters
and this isn't like the best way to
organize my sweaters because it kind of
does get a little irritating to have to
constantly fold them and keep them neat
size I honestly couldn't find any other
way to store them and I thought that you
know I
might as well just use that top shelf so
then underneath my flannels and shirts
I've got this little cube system that's
going on I think it has eight bins if I
am correct I actually got that little
cube system from Ikea it's made out of
white wood and then the white bins I
actually got from Target so they're just
simple white cloth bins I think they
match perfectly with my room but I love
having bins in my closet because it is
so easy to just throw things in and out
take them out and it keeps everything
clean looking that's like the best part
I kind of section them off with
different things so better you guys have
a closet that would fit that type of
cube system that I definitely recommend
it because bins are so easy to just keep
up with I'll go of my cube system I've
got some space to keep things on top
right below my crop tops one bin is for
my black white and nude socks and then
the one to the right has more crazier
colored socks fuzzy socks things that I
like to wear around the house so now I'm
moving to the right side of that same
closet I keep all of my dresses and
rompers hanging on the left side I've
got more of my t-shirt dresses that are
a little bit more casual then it kind of
fades in to just my normal shorter
dresses and then in the front I've got
my rompers I tend to reach for that rack
a lot actually because I really love
wearing dresses or robbers because it's
just such an easy outfit so I like to
have those at easy access and then
underneath that I actually got a little
shoe rack and I got from Target it was
super inexpensive I think about like 20
dollars it's been really easy to keep up
with the shoe rack and having it
organized and I also think that it just
fits perfectly right underneath my
dresses so I don't know what I'm gonna
do once I buy more shoes because that is
obviously going to eventually happen but
as of right now I am pretty satisfied
with the mini shoe rack now to the right
of that
it might look like I got a white garbage
can
which okay it actually is a garbage can
but I use it as a hamper because I found
that it was just the perfect size and it
fit perfectly right to near the door on
the side of the closet the last thing
that I can think about mentioning in
that specific closet would have to be
the hook on the wall and next to the
light switch I actually love these hooks
so much I have them all over my
apartment and so easy because you just
stick them onto the wall with this
sticker that it comes with and you can
hook them on anything in that closet I
like to store my little backpack I think
it looks cute there so I love love love
those hooks that is a huge tip that I
have for you guys it really optimizes
the amount of space that you have in
your closet so that is it for the first
closet that I have in my room here then
when you go across the mini little
hallway I've got a smaller closet and
the first thing you see when you open
the door is once again a hook I have it
on the inside of the door and that's
what I like to keep one of my most to
use satchels it's just a simple black
quilted bag from forever 21 yeah I just
really like having it there now actually
going into the closet I've got a wooden
shelf that was arty in there when I'm in
at the top and that's where I like to
keep my extra clean towels as well as
fresh sheets based towels
extra pillowcases things like that then
as you look down this is the closet
where I keep most of my pants and
bottoms actually all of them I got this
crate system from the Container Store
and I know it's not the prettiest but I
love it so so much it is so easy to kind
of separate and organize my bottoms and
it was also so inexpensive I think each
crate was about four dollars and nine
or something like that so the top bin
has all of my kind of material loose
comfy short so it's why it's not so
perfectly folded then underneath that
I've got all my denim shorts and I just
fold them in half and place them on top
of each other it's like the perfect size
underneath that I've gotten more shorts
but these are more colorful shorts that
I don't normally grab for any two bins
below that I have all of my longer jeans
so blue jeans black jeans gray white and
then the bottom bin has my overalls and
I think some longer like patterned pants
so that is how I like to organize my
bottoms and I really really love these
crates yes they look cheesy in their
plastic but hey they're white so I was
already content with that and they just
make organizing so much easier also you
guys might notice that the crate system
is not as long as the closet so of
course I have to do something on the
right and left side if you look to the
right
I've got yet again another hook and I
like to keep my one beach towel I
brought one beach towel here in
California because I don't go to the
pool or Beach too often but I do like to
go maybe once a week or something like
that so I like having one towel because
it's really easy to just keep track of
it and wash it once I'm done using it
and I just found that that was a perfect
place to store it then to the left side
of that little closet I've got my tripod
just because I don't really like leaving
out on my room because it's black it's
ugly so I just fold it up and I put it
in that corner the last thing that I
want to show you guys was the mirror
that I have right next to my two closet
doors and this is not just a mirror it's
not any mirror it's actually a special
mirror because it opens up to expose the
wall behind it so
got this mirror from Ikea and I have no
idea that this mirror was capable of
doing that when I purchased it because
it was just stuck on the wall in the
store behind the mirror I took smaller
adhesive little hooks I'm telling guys
I'm obsessed with these hooks I got
these little clear ones from Target and
I just aligned a bunch of them in a
perfect line on top of each other and
that is how I store all my necklaces and
guys if you have a wall that you could
do this to I totally recommend it
because I no longer have to worry about
having necklaces all tangled up into
bunches because they're all neatly being
hooked on the little hooks and it's just
so cute and I love it so much and no one
ever expects it so whenever I show
someone they're like oh that's such a
cool idea and it totally saved so much a
space as well and then also you guys
will see that on the door I have a few
smaller hooks which I like to hook my
like most worn rings to because it's
really easy to just take the ring off
the hook
and put it onto my fingers so that is
how I store some of my jewelry the rest
of mine I keep in a smaller jewelry box
that's actually in my room over to my
right over there but that is actually it
for today's video I hope you guys
enjoyed it and all you guys got some
inspiration on how you could you know
reorganize your closet I just find this
stuff to be really fun I don't know why
and just keeping my closet clean it's
like such an important thing to me so I
hope you guys enjoyed today's video
thumbs up if you did and I will see you
guys for a new video this Friday not
sure if you guys noticed but I've been
trying to follow a uploading schedule
I'm not committing to anything but
lately I've been trying to upload every
Tuesday and Friday and it's really been
working out and I really like Tuesday
and Fridays so I'm trying to keep up
with it but I will see you guys this
Friday and that is it for today's video
I totally said that like three times
