back to my channel also hi sir first I'm
clapping in it this is so many segments
you've got exciting this is many brag hi
we recently went shopping and we decided
we wanted to show you guys what we got
so this is actually a two-part haul if
you guys want to watch the other part we
will link it down below
okay the first link I mean let's just
get ready Yatta I think we each have
nine items so this is like a cookie
vault
yeah this is a half you know it was much
needed I was like kind of going to like
a balloon I call it I was like oh a
style funk I was going but I'm getting
out of it I'm like easing out of it we
went to free people and I got two things
from there first off the necklace that
I'm wearing right now so Coachella and
over there is suede barn which is very
in right now and then I also like how
there's like multiple trophy yeah so
looks like you're wearing like sixty and
then also I got this cool little choker
it's like really thick and it's got like
silver hardware a little black leather
panel panels straps on the back what I'm
going to call it also I probably will
wear this for Coachella because it's
very intense but I love it it looks
really good on I I mean obviously I went
to people too because who we were
together but I thought this is this like
scandalous to show I don't really care I
mean I I would say that we're all women
here but like I know that there's men
watching
yeah you know I got a bra it doesn't
have padding but has underwire it's got
like double little straps right here I
like almost yeah notice that it's a nice
mom yeah it's like a reunion love I love
it it's so comfortable when I tried on I
was like oh this is so nice it does look
like a bra but it still gives you that
nice support because you know I didn't
realize that like when you
have larger boobs bra let's are like
kind of a struggle I brought lots I just
like popping out us a little bit and so
I realized I know you got some fish I
had that problem as we're going with
this whole bralette theme of I might as
well show the two that I got I got two
from Urban Outfitters they're actually
the same but in different colors so this
one you actually already oh yeah I own
this I love it I told her she needed it
guys
she's so cute I think this is kind of
scandalous because there's like lace
over the nipples but like when you wear
it it doesn't look as wet samus's I
would think it looks so dainty and so
funny then it's so true I really like
the nude mesh on it as well and then I
got the same brought in this little
lilac color so cute I think I might need
to go back and get seems like it you
need to know jealous so like Valentine's
Day I ordered this one online we did go
too nasty up and I got this online I got
some some I like to wear animals
basically I wouldn't completely oh it's
from Nasty Gal
it's like this white red bathing suit
like looking top it doesn't have any
clasp in the back which I actually like
this no one can come by and like you
know dry and I'm looking or anything
it's just I love my material up
it's like ran into it really nice like
this jsut through wacky weather and then
just white bottoms they are like kind of
cheeky but you know I love a good
cheeky bathing suit bottoms how it bums
out baby this one this was kind of
boring but you know it's a thing
sticking with the whole trend Outfitters
theme I also got this old shirt but I
really liked it because of the very
small detail on the shoulder it looks
you know it looks like a baby onesie
it does yeah it looks like
when I put it on it looks very like
youthful and kind of baby doll and I was
like yeah well I feel very girly in this
but like overlaps and kind of Criss
crosses on both sides yeah and I thought
that was just such a cool random little
detail based I shirt yeah 55 I also went
to Urban Outfitters I got one little
thing I probably should have showed it
before this I guess it doesn't really
matter I got some earrings I always seem
to lose mine and right now I have like
four piercings in each year I believe
and I'm pretty sure I have like two in
this year and like maybe
I really am one in this year I don't
have one it's like the double piercing -
it's not - the third myself my hairs
think that there's low so I was like I
need to get some earrings to fill my
ears I mean they're hypoallergenic but
they're probably just sterling silver so
they might turn mate yours a little
green but they'll be good for a little I
mean thing is you're gonna lose them
yeah exactly it's like that from nasty
yo I got a flannel this one's a little
different that the other flannels that I
own because it's lighter it physically
shirt oh yeah yeah it's not like thick
clay it's not thick and it's also
cropped Oh like this would be really
countable I like mom jeans where they're
like high-waisted break their like tight
you know what I mean Flynn thank you
like a good plan I got this a nasty
y'all it's a phone case from Sonics and
it's like a little star clear case but
it also has sort of like a pink tint I
have like the base gray phone and it
makes it look like it's the rose gold
one oh that's foolish yeah it's cute I
like stars blog so I was like I think I
need it
next up I got some Jesus yes yes there
can use jeans
they're from Topshop and I thought these
are really cool because they're like a
really nice olive green type of color
these are the Genie genes which are by
far my favorite jeans means I'm wearing
them they are so confident it fits so
well and I feel like they're really good
a lot of people's bodies this is like a
lot of regional always say that very
nice high waisted but they're not like
too high-waisted yeah they go probably
like right at the belly riot at the Buy
button yeah speaking of jeans I got the
time get me the same I got these from
All Saints and they were on sale and
they're I would say they're like
low-rise and they have a nice cut
they're not like boyfriend jeans they're
a little bit more like slim I really
likes them on there called the slim boys
is the style slim fit mid rise straight
legs so from brandy melville I got a
skirt and it's cute so cute I'm gonna
see that button-up square it with
pockets and stuff and it just fits
really well so I thought that'd be cute
to wear you out
like the springtime stuff like that I
was a brandy melville also I mean we
went shopping together so we went to
this seems like you're entering all of
them like something I also it's we're
gonna do know this book book like
obviously I got this striped little like
button-up shirt I thought it would be
nice I love stripes I have a lot of
stripe things it has a nice collar it's
a really nice length it's not like never
long but it's not crop it's like perfect
I got some overalls from brandy melville
also and these are the same green color
that Claudia's jeans were a nice like
skinny fit I would say um what were
these right yeah they're tight oh that's
good this doesn't have like that little
school you know a little like front
pocket
that's around your phone yeah that's
what I love about little girls but it
does have you know those two guys
pockets here we just buy and some back
pockets which is good and go again
they're soft and a good price also from
brandy melville I got this bralette
which is cool because it's I feel like
it's like a hybrid of a sports bra and a
bralette like it's that comfortable and
I feel like if you wore something
high-waisted yeah okay so it looks like
this in striped it's so comfortable
is it I'm in love and then the back is
really cool too it kind of like goes
down and it's just great I got this
shirt from Urban Outfitters and it's
like stretchy it's nice and in fact it's
ain't brown what no this isn't very gray
and brown mixed together it looks a
little purple also like dark dark purple
yeah I thought that's what color wasn't
I pulled it out Brown but it looks
really really nice and it fits really
well and it stops I like it oh that's
that that's it it flew by because we
just like breeze through that I think
