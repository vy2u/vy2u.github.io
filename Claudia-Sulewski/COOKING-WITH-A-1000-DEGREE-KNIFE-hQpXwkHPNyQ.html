Oh what up guys welcome back to my
channel
I think it's fair to say the 1000 degree
nice video has been well over played
very overrated everyone has done it all
since on this video but you guys I am
just so curious and I genuinely and
human being want to experience this
because these videos look so satisfied
we are going to be doing to 1000 degree
knife challenge except we're going to
throw in a little twist and I'm going to
try cooking with a 1000 degree knife
well I'm going to do it I'm so excited
got my blowtorch safety gloves two
different hive I feel like I should
prepare a bowl of water just in case
anything touches plain chocolate water
check our first meal a day is very
appropriate a chicken Caesar salad this
is terrifying I really should have got
an assistant for this this is taking a
lot longer than I thought one here we go
really interesting the sizzle nice wood
burning I can smell it
step one is to cut up your lettuce now
we're going to add the futures si-jess
see that glowing yeah oh my god
yo no it's really heavy this is not a
good idea
pour on your dressing hmm
think about this this is what I guess
interesting obviously with every Caesar
salad you with some grilled chicken so
we've got some rush oh we're just going
to season it up a little bit I've got
some poultry seasoning this one I
genuinely have hope for I really feel
like we'll be able to cook the chicken
did it cook the chicken whoa it kind of
did yeah if I like pull it down right
that's the place to chicken if I've ever
seen one
let's swap those in there we cook it up
in here we cook it open yet that
obviously so it works amazing next up
we've got Parmesan cheese and crouton
really want you boys off all right well
are we ever to you yeah me okay glass
will not leave we of course have to add
the futon I'm actually really scared the
melted plastic I think she's ready oh
wow oh my god oh my god that was so
weird
oh wow that's get up Oh God let's throw
some of these bad boys in there this
salad looks so tasty I was going to wait
to eat it afterwards
following our Caesar salad of course we
need some dessert today I have prepared
to make some ice cream cookie sandwiches
so we've got some cookie dough hot fudge
to like drizzle on top I guess and some
ice cream in freezer and what I was
trying to see is this a knife is going
to bake the cookie yeah let's do this
ooh oh my god oh my god it'll work oh
it's so smoky I need it oh my god okay
honestly oh wow that's a lot of smoke
look so he did not make it all all you
need is to cooking you know if we can
make that happen I would be very happy
baking cookies
- and we're baking we're baking in place
our cookies on the plate that works
wonderfully if you ask me oh man we're
going to add some chocolate to these
cookies obviously I'm not actually going
to open the chocolate syrup let's burn
my Bruins my arms getting tired honestly
here we go woo yeah pour her on boom oh
I hate this video doing a nice little
spread this smells awful next up we've
got some almond dream vanilla ice cream
throw in between our partially cut first
cookies whoa look at all City fine yay
alright we've got her ice creams but
close I'll get cookie number one ice
cream Patti hooking number two Oh
doesn't that was good like I would try
this if I could consume propane but I'm
just assuming that's not actually
healthy for me so there we have it guys
today I talk to you how to not cook a
single salad and a cookie sandwich with
a 1000 degree all right you guys that is
it for today's video I semi enjoyed
making it honestly this video is really
terrifying to film when you're home
alone and don't have any other
assistants or pupils watching on fire so
yeah I don't really recommend doing it
if you guys want me to try out any other
challenges whether it be random like
this or make ups and comment them down
below because I think they're ones fun
to do I will see you guys for a new
video next week I am so freaking stuff I
cannot wait for you guys to see it and
yeah I love you guys so much bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
