in front of the camera and just talked
to you guys so I have filmed this intro
four times welcome back to my channel
today we are in my office it's super
cloudy outside so I know the lighting
would be changing without the video and
that happened in the last one and I'm so
annoyed that while editing so we are in
a controlled environment today we've got
artificial lighting it's great it's not
going anywhere we're good it's like I'm
taking my job seriously what today's
video is going to be a favourites
obsessions type video we're gonna be
talking about fashion beauty health
music life style random things like that
if you're new to my channel then be sure
to subscribe if you want to continue
watching and also hit that Bell
notification button coz the subscription
box and YouTube is just like a little
shady these days you know you don't
really know if you're like gonna see
it's just so shady
aside from that let's get into the video
we're gonna start off with beauty we
need to talk about this eyeshadow
because I've definitely mentioned it in
lots of videos I've probably tweeted
about it for some reason this is like
the one single shadow that I get asked
about all the time I'm wearing it right
now and I wore it in one of my more
recent videos and everyone was asking
what it was this is a single shadow from
Topshop it is in the shade changeling I
assume it's still available I definitely
seen it online basically it's just a
super pigmented damp shadow that has the
prettiest color to it it's sparkly but
it's super fine so it kind of gives your
eyes like this wet look I like to call
it my mermaid eye shadow it just makes
your eyes just look so cool in different
Lighting's
and yeah it reminds me of like the tail
of a mermaid next up I wanted to talk
about the glossy a cloud paints in dusk
I've definitely used this and like my
most recent tutorial or something and
basically it's just a super liquidy
cream blush just tap it on your cheeks I
love the color of it I love when blushes
have that sort of peach undertone to
them and I love it it's so easy to blend
going in theme with blush I also wanted
to talk about the color pop Ava Gutowski
collaboration I
have all the pallets and I'm obsessed
with that but I wanted to talk about the
myrrh wow we've got a scene today this
is called the mermaid Glo vase - oh and
I'm obsessed with the blush in this
compact the blush is beautiful it
honestly reminds me a bunch of the dusk
one that I just brought up so this does
not surprise me at all but also I really
really like the highlighter it's such a
pretty golden color next up we've got a
lip gloss I've never really been a huge
lipgloss fan I think sometimes they're
just too sticky and chunky Banaras has
figured it out I don't know what it is
about this like formula this is the
shade vida loca and I don't know like
what line this is from but it just it
looks like this there's no writing on it
I mean it's so pretty it's not too
pigmented which is what I like about it
so it phase and wears really nicely and
this has kind of become like an everyday
live product for me that I always have
in my purse next up I wanted to talk
about this sunscreen because now that
it's getting warmer outside the UV rays
are getting stronger I've also been on a
bunch of trips lately that have just
required being outdoors a lot more than
I usually am sunscreen is so important I
recently went to Bora Bora as you guys
saw and the UV rays out there were like
11 12 or something I was wearing SPF
every single day I wasn't burning I
wasn't getting tan I was a little bummed
out about that the second-to-last day
stuff and I were going jet skiing for
the second time and he was like super
cloudy and gloomy so we didn't think
about it and we're like you know what
like everyone else on this trip is like
either getting some sort of color burnt
tam whatever
nothing's happened to us like let's
let's not wear sunscreen for like the
two hours that were gonna be jet skiing
today biggest mistake of my life I wore
as half of my body but I didn't on my
face which led to me burning my face
entirely it peeled twice of course this
was like a week after once I was home I
was literally just like watching and we
and just peeling my entire face off it
was really disgusting the everyone
thought I had freckles unfortunately no
they were sunspots because now they're
gone I understand that's a good sign
because a lot of people are getting
concerned saying that I should go to a
skin doctor and I do plan on doing that
because in general I have a lot of
freckles that I should be checking up on
basically I learned my lesson and I'm
never doing that ever again because it's
just not worth it but I wanted to talk
about this sunscreen because it is so so
good
it is the unseen sunscreen
broad-spectrum SPF 40 from super goop
the consistency of this stuff is insane
it feels just like any other makeup
primer when I think of sunscreen I think
of white pasty greasy like doesn't sink
into your skin it just sits on there but
this one is like super creamy
it's mattifying it's so silky it melts
into your skin and they recommend using
this as like a primer before you put on
your makeup this is amazing I think
everyone should have this like in their
cars or and just bathrooms everything
next up we've got a skin care product
this is the Tula op1 fusion oil-free gel
cream in general I have been so obsessed
with tula i love their i mean honestly
I've been using all of it this is the
newest one that I've been diving into
the way to I'll describe it to me was
it's basically like a giant glass of
water for your face and I could not
agree more it is so lightweight and so
like I don't even I don't understand it
like it literally feels like you're
putting water on your skin but you
obviously know there's so much more in
here than just water if I'm not wearing
makeup which is most of the days then
this is something that I'll just apply
on every few hours just to give my like
skin that hydrating boost great great
brands I have got one more makeup
favorites and they are concealers these
are the Laura Mercier flawless fusion
ultra long wear concealers I actually
found that I really really like
contouring with them with the darker
shade this is 5n and because it's got
like the little doe foot applicator I
just draw it on my cheekbones forehead
temples whatever and then blend it in
with
Beautyblender sponge great for
contouring and then of course obviously
as a concealer it's also great and this
stuff just makes your skin look so like
I know that wasn't a great description
but it really makes it Wallace well this
fusion and the title I also want to talk
about a hair product because I have been
I've been all about hair recently which
is really it's never really been like my
thing I definitely got into a phase
where I didn't really care what sort of
like shampoo conditioner products I was
using in my hair I kind of just used
whatever I have but I wanted to talk
about this deep conditioning mask in
general if you guys follow me on
Instagram then you'll see I've been
raving about Bree oh gee oh but I am so
so obsessed their products are so
natural and good for your hair and
there's no sulfates no silicones no
parabens when I secure hair mask I think
oh you're supposed to use that like once
a week but I'm like too lazy to actually
do it but they recommend using this as
your regular conditioner which like
completely rocked my world and just
changed everything and it also actually
recommends that you use it from root to
tip which I was always scared to do like
I always thought like oh no no no you're
like you're not supposed to do that to
your roots but they actually recommend
it it changed everything I'm being so
dramatic about this but seriously next
up we've got some fashion related things
I only have like three things to show
you guys because in general I'm going
through a phase right now I'm calling it
my funky phase I'm really enjoying just
kind of wearing everything and anything
I almost love like not matching hence it
starts matching if that makes sense but
okay I want to talk about these shoes
these are actually really simple but
they become such a staple in my wardrobe
they are the Puma basket it's a basket
on a shoe but they're just like high
platform sneakers
superga platform sneakers became like
super in last year but I feel like these
are kind of just like a different
version of that I love how they're shiny
so you can really like play them up I
wear these with maxi dresses skirts or
short dresses regular outfits love the
gold detailing on like the little shoes
and the writing and stuff and yeah
that's always asking me about them so I
wanted to show that I wanted to show you
guys two purses the first one is a
little backpack I've definitely been
showing this off it's this tiny little
Kenzo backpack and it's like a light
blue gray with maroon and it's got a
little tire on the front and I'm
obsessed with the silver hardware and
like the athletic straps because you can
also unclip these and just use one and
clip them here and make it like a little
purse that sits at the front it
surprisingly kind of matches with like
almost everything I wear which you would
just like what like this is just so
random you know the next piece I'm gonna
show is basically like the smaller purse
version of that same level of funky and
color but just kind of different and
looks a little nice too I just recently
got this so it's a little newer in my
life but it is this little tiny bag from
YSL so it was a little more expensive I
got it at an outlet mall so definitely
got a huge discount on it but I love the
little tassel with the little silver key
chain that says why I sell an inch of
zips open I just like love the collars
on the front I think it's so cute and
funky I was with Lauren when I bought
this and she was like dude if you don't
want to have color you can just flip it
over and just have it like a simple
black little bag which is so true next
up I've got two food health related
things and then afterwards I've got a
few like music favorites whatever the
first thing is viral proteins matcha
collagen I've definitely been talking
about this quite a bit and I'm not being
paid to say this or anything I'm
literally obsessed with this brand I'm
obsessed with this product specifically
I've been drinking it every single day
in general collagen is great for you
it's great for your hair your skin your
joints your nails it's powdered collagen
but it's there matcha flavor they have
so many different types I've always been
a huge matcha fan I have so many like
matcha powders in my cabinet but the
reason why I'm so obsessed with this is
because the way that it's like designed
formulated whatever powdered up you can
put this in any cold or hot beverage
because formerly with matcha it's got to
be hot water and you need that special
little whisk or some sort to like break
it all down but this stuff mixes so well
into any
quit so half the time I'm throwing this
into water adding ice adding milk and
you have ice matcha latte without having
to like make it hot and then prepare
cold if that makes sense I've literally
shaken them into water bottles and added
like a little bit of stevia and it's
just a game changer the last
food-related thing I want to bring up is
a protein powder that I'm obsessed with
I prefer plant protein and for a while I
have been using the plant fusion vanilla
flavored protein I ran out of my big tub
of it so I want to try out a different
brand and this is the Vega protein and
greens vanilla flavored it kind of
tastes like cookies and cream but like
without the cookies part like just the
cream part but like that specific taste
it is so good we're on the last leg the
only random favorite that I wanted to
bring up outside of music is a podcast
that I've been obsessed with Dax Shepard
came out with a podcast called aren't
are expert with Dec Shepard each episode
he brings on a different guest another
actor or a musician
another talk-show host like Jimmy Kimmel
was on it Ellen DeGeneres Kristen Bell
love her the first episode that I
watched was I think the first one with
Ashton Kutcher and I'm obsessed I think
I just had a stroke right now that is
what the initial appeal was I love that
his podcasts are two hours each because
you really just feel like a fly on the
wall you learn a lot of things just like
along the way - I'm really getting a lot
of advice for like parenting obviously
I'm very young so I don't need that in
my life right now but it's interesting
to hear because he talks about like
being a dad and like being in this
industry and whatever and eventually
that's gonna be me and so it's cool to
kind of like hear the different things
that he's screwed up with and also
succeed adapt whatever I've talked about
enough we're done now let's get into
music favorites the first one I want to
bring up was an album in general it's
super old and I've definitely like
listened to a bunch but for some reason
this
I've just been on such a kick and I've
been listening through like the entire
album and it is so beautiful it is so
good it is called the mistress from
yellow ostrich I'll give you guys a few
little snippets of their songs it's a
little slower but the build-up is so so
pretty
so good hold on is probably like my
favorite one it's so good that album is
like a very specific mood and theme when
you're in that mood it is the best thing
ever so it's by alt-j is dead crush
salute remix I remember the first time I
heard the drop I was like you gotta bump
this in the car you know this is kind of
just become like an anthem for me and I
think every female who's watching this
video right now needs this song in her
life because hey it is it's funny but
it's so like empowering
it's called truth hurts by my soul is oh
I don't know how to pronounce that
anyways it is so good it's such a Bop
too like blasting this in a car amazing
this song is a little funky it's a
little weird it might not be everyone's
taste but I personally enjoy it my
friend Braden showed it to me it's
called it's only sex by car seat
headrest next up I want to show you guys
televised by honey
this song is cool because it changes
like rhythm and speed and so it feels
like literally four different songs in
one song it's so cool it's it's really
good
I will link my Spotify profile down
below because all these songs are kind
of spread out everywhere honestly my
2018 playlist is like a little messy but
there's like you know something some
good playlists in there yeah that is it
for my favorites video I hope you guys
enjoyed it and I feel like this one was
a long one but that's okay once again if
