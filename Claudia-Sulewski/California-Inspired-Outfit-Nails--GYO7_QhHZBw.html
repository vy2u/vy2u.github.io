nail tutorial and it's going to be a
little bit different because normally I
like to create now tutorials that are
inspired by different trends let me go
turn that off so rude anyways most of my
tutorials are inspired by different
seasons trends collars things like that
but today I'm going to be doing
something a little bit different and I'm
going to be creating a tutorial that is
inspired by a location today's tutorial
is inspired by Los Angeles California so
these nails are super beachy and summer
inspired which is perfect for this time
of year I think it's so fun and bright
and colorful and I think it replicates
that California vibe perfectly after you
guys watch the tutorial I'm going to
show you an outfit that is also inspired
by these nails and Susie Callie live so
let's get started with the tutorial I'm
starting off by using my Sally Hansen
complete salon manicure polish in the
shade barracuda and I'm just applying it
to all of my nails apply on as many
coats as you need to get an opaque color
and this blue is such a pretty sky blue
that is perfect for this tutorial after
that i'm using my Sally Hansen I
Hartnell or white striper to create
stripes on the ring finger and the thumb
you can draw your lines out as thick or
as thin as you want but using a striper
like this rather than a normal nail
polish will give you more control and a
cleaner look
to create the sun i will be using my
complete salon manicure polish in the
shade of golden rule and the iheart nail
art tool kit using the dotting tool from
the kit I'm creating a large circle on
the top corner of my ring finger then
I'm just dragging out lines to create
the Sun with the smaller brush and that
is how my son turned out for our next
assign i'm going to using the sally
hansen i heart nail art black pen and
i'm going to be creating glasses on my
thumb if you ask me there is no better
way to represent california then a pair
of sunglasses and a sparkling golden sun
if you're having troubles drawing out
these sunglasses you can always use
google images as a reference or you can
just follow along with my video then to
finish off the nails always use a top
coat for example the complete salon
manicure cleared for takeoff polish and
once you do that you are completely
finished so I Hansen is currently
hosting their I heart nail art contest
where you can enter your nail art look
for a chance to win five hundred dollars
and a trip to New York City to compete
in the grand finale for a prize of two
thousand dollars all the information on
that will be in the downbar now to match
with my nails here is my outfit
for starters I'm wearing this loose
fitted a light blue tank top and threw
on an open it cardigan to fight off the
wind for bottoms I'm wearing some light
wash denim shorts and light blue
sneakers for these shoes the stripe
material matches perfectly with the nail
art my gold jewelry also complements the
Golden Sun on my ring finger and that's
it for my cute and comfy Los Angeles
California inspired outfit so I hope you
guys enjoyed today's video and I'll talk
to you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
