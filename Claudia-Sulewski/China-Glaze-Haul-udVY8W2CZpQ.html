doing a pretty exciting haul for you
guys today and it is from a nail polish
website that's called I think it's like
maybe a calm I don't know it's something
it's something like a TA or something
like that I don't know but I'll leave
the description I mean I'll leave the
link in the downbar so that you guys can
check out that website and basically
it's just an online nail polish website
that it's most popular for some China
Glaze nail polishes and the coolest
thing about that website is they only
sell trying those nail polishes for two
dollars and eighty-eight cents that is
like insane compared to how much you
have to pay like at bolta or something
that's crazy so first I'm just I start
out with packaging and stuff well I
ordered it I think Sunday night and it
came Wednesday night which is today
which is not bad at all but it was in a
box and it had like little wrapping I
mean bubble wrap and then the packaging
is actually really cute it comes in like
packs of three and it looks like that it
says try glaze and like there's like a
little window so you can see the nail
clashes and most of these I have not
opened yet so basically it's kind of
like a first reaction type of thing so
yeah I'm just going to go ahead
let's get right into it so hold up let
me start off with that first box
okay so every single thing that God was
confront lays and there's also like
little newspaper in their tubes that
they don't I don't know it's I mean like
hit each other or whatever okay so this
is the first color and this is recycle
and I think this is like from like the
eco friendly like collection or whatever
and I'm actually wearing it on my nails
right now this is like though one of the
two that I like pulled out or whatever
but um it's a really pretty color and I
think it's very interesting like how
awesome is that it's like a matte or
creamy like legit gray eye nail polish
which i think is really cute and
actually matches like my cardigan from
Joyce ek so that's kind of cool
um but I think it's a really really
really pretty color and it's very
interesting you know you don't see
people with like green ales a lot of
times so the next color is secret
periwinkle and it looks like this
super-dee-duper pretty love it now that
I have a new camera I'm like so happy
that I can actually show you guys and
like they'll focus so yeah very cute
periwinkle color um this one I'm really
excited for and this is fairy dust and
you can't wear it by itself it's why I
guess you can but it's just like
sparkles so when you put it on it just
like like I could put it over my
granddad posh and it'll look like fairy
dust those just sprinkled on my nails
cuz I saw pictures from Google Images
and able to breathe through the pretty
and I think this was like I don't know
if it was nevermind okay I think I don't
know but one of the nail polishes I got
was definitely like $3 but maybe it was
this one
I don't know but super Freddie I really
liked it
oh wait there you go okay there's that
so those are the first three for my haul
okay
let's go into the next ones cool paper
okay so the first one is selections the
fourth but whatever this is wagon trail
and I chose like I told my mom before I
got these and we're looking at them and
she just really wanted one real quick so
my mom chose this one because she wanted
like a deep copper nail polish color and
I think this one is like really
interesting you can't really see in the
video but it's like a chocolate brown
with like gold sparkles in it I think
it's really cool it's definitely really
interesting she has it on her nails
right now and it's very cute I mean it
looks really good I mean so yeah there's
that
that's wagon trail then this is
flip-flop fantasy and oh my god this
thing is like neon pink like it doesn't
look nearly as neon as it does in the
camera compared to like real life like
I'm not even kidding you guys it like
doesn't get brighter than this I mean
you guys like can't even tell but really
pretty filler like it so the next one is
first-class ticket and I really like
dark colors for the winter and once
again lighting isn't really showing too
great of the actual color but when I saw
on the website it reminds me a lot of
OPI ink by OPI and that is like my
number one favorite nail Fache from OPI
I'm actually gonna go get it really
close on
okay so here's OPI ink and obviously
there's like a lot more sparkles in this
but from what I saw in pictures of
Google Images this one reminds me a lot
of it because it's like a deep purple
and then it has like pink and blue
sparkles in it which is exactly what OPI
Inc has but I think this one is a lot
more sparkly we can compare them but I
mean you can see the similarity so yeah
that was first-class ticket
okay so if the last three pairs of now
Pasha's that I got were second porno
okay so the first one is and this is
like the first thing that I put on my
little into my little cart I was so
excited to get this one and this one is
refreshment and it's just like a very
creamy pest le Minh teal I'm not lying
but like green color I'm so excited to
wear this color because I've seen a lot
of people get this nail polish and I had
to get it for myself because I think
it's really cute and it's another one of
those colors that's very different so I
liked that next one is a great pop and
it looks like this it's just a very
matte and creamy dark purple which I
really like because I don't have one of
those basic colors like purples
because any Purple's I actually have are
all sparkly and I think this one is
really interesting because it's like a
matte finish or whatever so love that
and the last nail polish I got which
also I'm very excited about is peachy
keen and once again it's another one of
those past daily cream colors and it's
just like a Melanie orange and I've been
wanting like a melon colored nail polish
for a very very long time so this is
peachy keen love it and yes so that now
pops
includes my fall from China Glaze so
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this quick
little haul of the nine nail polishes
that I got definitely recommend you guys
to check out that website that I got
these from I mean it's an amazing deal
so I mean I don't think I'm ever going
to by trying to go
polishes from the actual store because
this was like more than like half off
okay yes so that's it for today's haul
and I'll see you guys for another video
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
