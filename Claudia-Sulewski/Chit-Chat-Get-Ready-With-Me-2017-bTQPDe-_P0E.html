yes this is wallpaper that I spent three
hours putting up on my wall if you guys
like see what my place is starting to
look like and how it's coming together
then be sure to follow my blog channel
because I have been blogging multiple
times every single week so I'll have
that link down below but yeah I'm slowly
you know figuring out what setups I want
to have for my main channel videos and I
really like this background so hopefully
it's not like too distracting or
anything today's video is going to be a
chitchat get ready with me because I'm
only films like one of these I'm also
really excited because a lot of the
products that I'm using today I've never
personally used before we're going to
keep it super chilled their voiceovers
no added anything we'll sit back relax
grab a snack maybe get ready with this
video I don't know I'm going to tie my
face twice today I'm feeling crazy I'm
going to start off with a spray first
I'm going to use the tarts I will love
tart stuffing from me as well as warm
air CA and then a few other companies
but I'm using its hearts Ready Set
radiant
spray and I'm just gonna benefit if go
this smells really good it smells like
jasmine green tea also you guys might
notice that my eyelashes work a little
longer I just recently got eyelash
extensions for like the second time of
my life basically I'm in the middle of
shooting a movie right now and so I
wanted to just have longer lashes and I
was freaking obsessed
it makes me actually not want to wear
makeup because actually like I don't
need to I have to show you guys this is
so funny so I'm obsessed the Real
Techniques blending sponges but it's
their face and body blender and it's so
big oh this one is so big and I kind of
like want to try to use it for my face
because it might actually like make it
an easier and quicker draw I don't know
now going to use a foundation primer
I've used this like years ago before
high school I think and I never really
use it enough to like have an opinion on
it I don't know
I don't know I'm using alarm arrastia
foundation so I was like you know what
let's use this primer yeah I honestly
never really put my face anyways I just
used like Clinique dramatically
different moisturizing gel it's so
lightweight oh my god wait I'm running
into this maybe it's like the time of
year but lately my face has been getting
really oily throughout the day and the
stuff is oil free so I am all about it
the way we forgot to mention this but I
woke up this morning with like a weird
dry spot on my neck and then I spent on
self-tanner and now it looks like a
hickey so I just want to like make a
statement and say that this is not a
hickey the foundation that I'm using
today is the warmer see a flawless
fusion ultra long wear foundation it's
the shade 3c one in doing it I don't
want to be dramatic but personally this
is a very monumental moment because I
never not use makeup forever on my face
this is so weird
this is basically turning into a full
face the first concussion because I'm
literally also using like all new
brushes from Real Techniques they're one
of my favorite brush brands also shout
out to the pixie woo Bells jingling oh
I'm going to use the expert face brush
and just start putting that on my face
okay i straight up I feel like I'm
filming a reactions video right now
because this is so foreign to me oh my
god it's like such a different
experience okay wait I really and I
really like this just straight away I
can tell it has like a pretty matte but
slightly dewy finish like it's not too
shiny and it's like super full coverage
to kind of already mentioned it in the
intro but I would obsessed with vlogging
and for those of you who are keeping up
with the vlogs and commenting and stuff
I like overwhelmed with the amount of
feedback that I'm getting from you guys
and it's also positive and it makes me
very happy
also as previously mentioned I am
currently shooting my first feature ever
for Elizabeth one of my best friends is
also in it and right now she's been
shooting a bunch of her stuff because it
all depends on like what set is built in
a location and all that stuff the next
week is pretty chill for me but after
that they're going to build
mindset and I'm going to have all my
stuff oh yeah all that is being filmed
over most of July I'm going to cover up
this little spot that looks like a
hickey not a hickey also this freakin
brush man so good okay I forgot to put
something in oh yeah I wanted to mix the
tarts radiance drops because I hear so
many things about them I forgot to put
them in the thing I can't just like put
on my face now so I guess we'll save
that for another day
now I'm going to use the laura mercier
secret camouflage concealer palette I'm
just going to use a little under my eyes
oh yeah what's up I'm filming uh let me
get ready to chat video
just going to use this giant thing to
blend I guess now we're going to do a
little cream contouring it's probably
one of my favorite stuff honestly this
is the one makeup for everything that
I'm going to use because I'm obsessed
with their pro scooping palace they're
on brer contour is like the prettiest
topi cool tone Brown and I just love it
for contouring I'm going to grab a
little bit on the sculpting brush oh
yeah I hate having a pimple right where
you contour and put a lot of products in
I always add a little bit at the top
here because I have a giant forehead
whatever we can do to make that look
kind of smaller fun fact I was actually
a huge insecurity of mine when I was
younger because I think I just like
always had a giant forehead and then as
I grew older I like grew into my
forehead that sounds so strange but
growing up it was just even more
noticeable and it was like one of my
biggest insecurities and now it still is
but not that also like work with what
you got who cares
shade in that double chin ah that's
another thing and then I always bring it
down a little bit to neck here oh I'm
going to go in with my favorite setting
powder ever it works out comes from
warmer shade but it is there translucent
loose setting powder but I'm going to go
away
okay well usually I use a beauty blender
but all I brought down was this huge
thing I think I'm going to do a little
bit of baking under the cheek just a
little bit
I guess I'll I'll do that with this
thing okay
they're so uneven oh my god oh my god up
so they said knock it is not going to
work
I need use the brush there we go and
then in a few minutes I'm just going to
blend everything out because I don't
want to have too much powder on my face
well that's clicking on my face a little
bit I'm going to finish up my eyebrows
I'm obsessed with the makeup for over
Pro sculpting a brow palette I've been
using this for I think over a year now
and I really like the two darker shades
especially since I just dyed my hair
black so I'm just going to start my red
little now I'm going to go in with this
powder brush and just blend out this
powder that was sitting on my cheeks I
guess it's time I switch over to eyes
probably sure that eyes first and I can
do anything that crazy we're going to
start working on the eyes we're up close
and personal now for eyeshadow I'm using
the tarte list in bloom palette this is
from Tarte it is so gorgeous
I've already started on this eye but I'm
basically just blending smarty-pants
into my crease to kind of get a
transition base color going so I'm just
dabbing it in there I'm so sloppy and
like not professional with my eyeshadow
I just like we're multi very easy to
please in my camp
this looks great also like on a normal
day I'd be done now looking good I think
I'm going to add a little bit on my
lower lash line too so I'm just
flattening the brush with my fingers
because I'm too lazy to change it what
to do what to do I'm gonna grab the
funny girl and apply this to my lids yes
that's what we're gonna do it's kind of
like a
shimmery gold whoa okay I'm going to try
to stay close to the inner corner with
this one because it's a little lighter
than I thought it would be I'm going to
go in with this shade right here it's
firecracker shimmery just like the
previous one but it's like a dark brown
let's see what happens
whew guys these freaking eyelashes are
really hard to ignore I'm like going oh
no I'm getting fallout now we're good
really what am i doing right now I don't
even understand on the outside I'm going
to start to bring this up and out to
give my eyes a bit of a cat eye shape
but continuing to kind of blend it in
towards the center yes I am about that
I'm going to go ahead and do the same
thing on the other eye whoa I am really
really happy with it so far I take this
dark brown right here it's called
activist I'm going to put the smallest
amount into my crease we're getting
risky here also this color I'm bringing
it down onto the lashline start off and
also using it to create that cat eye
they're really about this brush right
now it is the Real Techniques precision
smudge brush Oh even just sounds nice
I'm going to go in with that darkest
shade again and just smudge it onto my
lower lash line
and then I'm also going in and
connecting the bottom to the top and
that kind of helps to make sure that
like I'm doing the same thing on both
eyes this is very quickly becoming a
smokey eye almost empty eyes I'm going
to go in with my favorite mascara which
is the benefit roller lash you're not
allowed to put mascara on your extension
so I'm just going to put it on the
bottom I think I'm gonna be using two
different bronzers today because one is
a little bit more shimmery in-betweener
for my bronzer and blush I use a Tarte
Park ass princess bronzer if you like a
lot of people talk about this I
personally never tried it I'm excited
I'm going to use this on my forehead I'm
gonna cheeks all that stuff because it
has a bit of a shimmer to it but it
sounds crazy the other one
just going to go in whoa I'm going to
try out this other bronzer why not this
is from Becca it's the Sun like bronzer
this one is a lot darker and a lot more
sparkly and I've never used so many
symbols care so let's do it oh okay that
starts I seriously feel like I'm only
using Laura Mercier and now all using is
tart but I have this blush and
highlighter combo them so excited about
its the exposed blush and the exposed
time later I got this is one of their
more popular blushes right I feel like I
always hear about exposed donning so
pretty I love it I really don't know how
much is going to come off so I'm going
to definitely aggressively tap off any
excess oh oh he's so nice oh my gosh I'm
gonna go with the highlighter this is so
pretty
ice watch it with my finger it is so
buttery so pigmented like oh this press
right here iconic what is it the setting
brush I use it for under my eyes but
also I'm going to use it for the
highlighter I'm going to go a little bit
up here and bring it around let's see on
the tip and pull it up a little here
last but not least what course have to
do the lip I'm using a card from bite
this is their amuse-bouche a liquefied
lip probably butchered that looses the
shade caramelized and I never tried it
on my lips but I splash it on my hand
and I kind of minded me of exposed from
the Kylie lip kit and I really really
like that color it's like a little bit
more oranjee on me I love it it's stuff
smells so good fish off of course going
to use some setting spray I'm so excited
because I actually get to wear this top
