every day but they're so good that was
my oh I kind of wish the amount of
people that tell me to listen I wish I
could oh my god we are filming a mukbang
oh I'm so hungry I'm so ready so excited
we also have a three-course meal so
we've got some rice balls for that I
feel like you should just yeah
definitely should be on the appetizer we
have these brown rice balls type
situation we've got our little hot oh we
got like this oh my god we got the same
thing we got the same thing
okay got it and then we also have a
dessert we've got with what's that one
this is a raw sugar free heat yourself
key lime pie hahaha we've got a raw
gooey brownie situation happening over
here and that's what it looks like okay
we can see it can you see it can I come
on one of your trips now it's hard it's
such a pretty color it really isn't that
okay really good you know
I don't think it's going to be okay the
first one actually didn't make it to my
house because I made it to the floor and
broke so the human being I am I put it
back all right
I'm really excited for you to try this
rice ball because this is your first
time I'm losing my vCard to the rice
ball that was like it hit my tongue and
it was a gong what is in those it's soft
on the inside too crunchy on the outside
it's like teriyaki yourself oh my god I
don't know but it's so sticky I can't
even apart you don't think about so this
is my personal living alone right and I
always have this fear that I'm gonna
like faint or pass out or like trip on
the stairs but no one's gonna be here to
realize it or like call the police whoa
I mean I think about this probably like
every other day if I lived alone I would
absolutely think about your honor ink
goes like my stairs do you imagine if I
just like a downstairs
I would crack my head open and literally
no one would know
I have fallen and I can't get up the
iconic like video of an ambulance
driving down the most suburban street
yeah it's like a necklace a necklace
that has a button on it I swear to God
after this video my mom's gonna call me
and be like Claudio she really
considered a life where I'm on your side
yeah oh my god that was put up yes thank
God you love one of two people who watch
it
we stayed like on the ground so like
they had this they bought like all of
these acres and go morning and night
safari for three hours each we're
driving and all the sudden we like pass
a giraffe every was like oh there's a
giraffe like it was that's absurd
it was so cool because it wasn't like
one of those safaris where the animals
like come up and they're used to humans
the guys are just like wild like they're
doing their thing there's no cell
service it was the greatest day of my
life
oh also we're filming a video on your
channel yes what are we doing we are
telling each other what to say to
strangers because I interview strangers
and I have a series where I take my
friends and we tell each other what to
say or do to strangers them I'm so
scared
everybody always is so scared of them
like when we're done everyone's like
it's so funny because like who kissed
you will never that's so true you will
never you'll never see those people
again if you do it's like kind of a
funny like oh my god we're in my video
once the cameras on you're kind of
fearless and you just do it you're in I
mean like I think like my survival like
instincts are just gonna kick it and be
like yeah yeah you're gonna thrive yeah
you really well I really think you well
it's like low pressure low yeah I
watched all the tannin I was like oh I
mean I watched all of that one that one
was absurd not what was probably in my
most fun video yeah chickens a little
dry today I was thinking this see how
you like it I was like the sticky rice
meatballs give it to him leave him that
yelp review go in
yeah I will eat this for free what's the
first thing I used to be really into if
I wrote my college essay on my bucket
list Wow I don't know big deal I wanted
to get a kiss from Hilary Duff on the
cheek because she was my first ever like
crush I did that oh my god I was gonna
say how close were you did that
happening I did it she liked because she
wrote a book she had book signing so I
went and I was like it's on my bucket
list yeah I was that kid at the meet up
who was like a kiss on the cheek it
really was like so innocent and cute
everything I'm about to say is just so
standard skydiving are like seeing the
Northern Light yeah but like who doesn't
want to see like exactly don't look why
is that bad it's true or like doing is
gravity plane I want to do that so bad
I think about those probably three times
a week all the time I think about zero
gravity plans all the time I don't care
about going to space
I remember just let me float for a
little bit yep the planes that like go
up and down yep
oh wow yeah I feel like I just have to
bring this up because it's just so pop
in it's so relevant it's so hip with the
team's morale I don't care about yeah me
and Laurel I've been sitting there in
front of that stupid video that says
vote in bad handwriting trying to hear
Laurel I have a question oh my god let's
go the handwriting on your insta stories
how do you do it

stencil work from Michael's craft store
I try and do it I said bad mojo oh my
god I will like try writing I know don't
you write like happy Saturday and it
looks flawless and I said I write have a
Saturday and but it starts off strong
and then it's like is that your heart
rate wait what is that this has been
something I've literally been getting to
ask you so long oh my god I would
actually be honored you just gotta like
go with it there's no see I do that well

what should we write I'll just go let's
do happy Friday no what pen do you pick
you do oh no no no you pick the fat
marker and you do it really small and
like maybe let's find like a lavender
pink bitch I keep track what font do I
use the typewriter font I mean that's a
little sloppy but
like see this is what it looks like when
I try writing but that's me going for it
we do side by side I'm gonna say why
just might look like that what I'm over
this
did you see how Stefan posted this photo
saying using a potato jar yeah I'm so
over this oh hi this is party us a--

pants have seams on them top three
online stores to shop out at the moment

and all its women's only but Reformation

I'm going through a wonderful unit face
what is that unit unit you know like you
and I have you can spell in it you can
put into crossword I still don't know
wait are you serious I'm Instagram or
like the internet do dance cram I'll do
the website divide and conquer
truly oh my god how am I not known about
this this is blowing my mind
wonderful basics yeah oh my God why have
I not known of you know I know I'm
literally following them right now okay
so I've just been sleeping under a rock
yeah yeah this is so I'm so glad we're
filming this just for ya we're covering
a lot of time so much right now I don't
know how it's pronounced it's either
essence or sense mmm two S's and then en
sce.com
it's like yes yeah so sense but okay
wait so they read we resell it's
basically like an online Barney's but
with more brands I
everywhere and oh this is wonderful yeah
and it's free shipping for things over
two hundred dollars two-day shipping
it's so nice oh wow that's when you
can't move your body I think so I mean
like I see I don't know the difference
between sleep paralysis and me just not
wanting to get out of bed but apparently
you know when you're having sleep
paralysis but I'm like really you wake
up in the middle of night I think you're
able to look but does your body still
see for your mind is it I think that's
what it is weird so I guess I would know
if I yeah
do you ever lucid dream or have you ever
that's where you can like control your
dreams and shoes that happens okay same
here growing up I just remember always
being able to at least when I wake up in
the morning and then like go back to bed
then I definitely could miss a dream oh
I taught myself to continue a dream
weren't enough just going on the play
button and picking back them right off
literally honest especially when you're
having like a wonderful trip oh yeah
when you're like sleeping like I can't
do it as much anymore but when I was
younger my dreams were crazy okay can I
tell you my first dream about Justin
Bieber my first time with Justin
honestly I don't think there are very
many Justin dreams following this one
because I but I just needed to make that
clear I'm not like clear if I could
choose he's gonna be my dream number one
I remember it was like in middle school
or something and me and him we the dream
took place on a giant chessboard made
out of wood and so I remember we were
like running from something
and we're like hiding behind the pieces
because they were giant chess pieces
like me like Harry yeah bigger and
everyone was wood and we're like running
so I'm how we ended up
my elementary school but all the
hallways the floors were dug out into
trenches like mud trenches we were like
in a war but it was happening in school
and we were just like ducking and
running two trenches together this was
me middle school is that creepy
whoa I just like slept up my question
something like Donald War I know why
you're a therapist no you have something
that's a drunk story I think my last
drunk experience I put up on my YouTube
channels of story time because it was
your birthday party all I remember is
that night walking into your apartment
for the pregame yep screaming I want to
black out tonight-- went straight for
the tequila the COS amigo stuck put it
in a cup halfway up and just started
drinking I was swinging from all the
rocks and the guy was like you have to
get down nicely look how cool I love it
can you take a picture he's like you
have to get down oh my god that was neat
Alexis she's like it's my trick I do it
every time try it giant Emily and I were
out standing on the speaker's swinging
and then I left my father to her drivers
well I blacked out and then was walking
all around on the rocks like that like
around it like I got french fries at
some restaurant nearby I went to a gas
station Wow
didn't realize any of this until I
looked at my bank statement but the
pre-game like most definitely became
like the main events it was yeah I mean
I've never had that many people in this
apartment I had anxiety for you about it
was important next morning was discuss I
cannot even been you know what really
like dalla was the pinata
there was confetti everywhere and the
pinata is filled with condoms
yeah many bottles of alcohol yes I have
never hit the floor harder that when I
saw that pinata first okay I was like
elbowing people out of the way I was
like just you know when you get drunk
and like everything's kind of a
competition yeah I mean it was live I
was like oh god mom I mean like I it was
like truly the world was ending and I
was getting everything
I could to survive there's a video I'm
gonna put on the screen of Drew he
filmed me like smashing the pinata and
you just see his little fingers that was
such a good pinata right before we left
to go to the bar club whatever I just
remember like standing up on these two
chairs knows what I said I was like
everyone that's in this room right now
that means that you have given so much
love and whatever into my life and I'm
like saying oh that was such a good
drunk oh my god in that everyone is like
chug chug chug somebody gave you a
bottle rose' and so I started chugging
the rosacea really started chugging
course sometime in middle school I had
the biggest key lime pie face really I
don't know why cuz it's such a weird
it's definitely a weird dessert and this
we're gonna get so many comments about
how this doesn't look like no it looks
like a really the most like Los Angeles
yeah we're aware of the comment you're
leaving I mean listen the number one
ingredient is avocado crustose looks
like it's barely holding on oh oh it's
really like moosie yeah there's a big
it's like a lot of lime like that slime
Wow
but it's good it is a lot of life and
it's not like sweet lime either it's
just it's like sour straight-up line
like this is really sour it's falling
apart
who isn't y'all the crust is so good oh
my god it's like soft 1 out of 10 what
are you reading this I'm gonna write it
like an eight it's really good besides
the fact that it just tastes like I'm
biting into a lion I'm gonna use yeah
I'm gonna give it a 7 for that reason
they get taste like a vodka soda
yes vodka side of a boy I think this
might be my last favor I follow
alright let's transfer me more more
texture happening yeah hi hi House
higher I loved it hated it love devil
that was a rollercoaster I was like this
is good oh I hate this yeah you know
what it is is it the chocolate no just
tastes like cacao so it's the healthy
sort of chocolate I was expecting a
different type of chocolate I was kind
of expecting it right this is healthy
because it was like at erawan yeah it's
definitely better than the vodka soda
that's a cake Wow
