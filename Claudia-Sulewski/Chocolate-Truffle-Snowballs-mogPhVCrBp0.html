brownie mix and dry measuring cup I'm
using one from Betty Crocker and it's
just their fudge brownies and all you're
gonna do is just measure one and a half
cups of the brownie mix so after that
you just want to pour in two tablespoons
of oil
then you're gonna add in two tablespoons
of water so now as you can see I'm just
kind of mixing it up a little bit so for
the last ingredient you're going to be
adding in Mayo yes you heard that right
we're gonna be using Mayo just because
we're not gonna be baking this recipe so
you do not want to use raw eggs because
you can get salmonella poisoning and all
that stuff so we're replacing Mayo with
eggs and that is because mayonnaise
actually contains eggs in them but it's
safe to eat raw so yeah you're just
gonna put in two teaspoons of this do
not put in two tablespoons that would be
disgusting and don't worry you don't
taste it at all it's just replacing the
egg so once you are done with that
you're just going to mix it all up until
it turns into kind of a thicker
consistency
so once that dough is ready you're gonna
take any cookie pan and put on some wax
paper over it
and I'm just gonna be rolling the dough
into small little circles or spheres or
whatever but you can make them whatever
size you want I did it kind of like an
inch thick I guess I kind of made them
small but yeah you can make them as big
as you want
once you are done with that you're gonna
place it in the freezer for a couple of
hours or I definitely suggest overnight
so on to the next day I'm going to start
out by just preparing the coconut so I'm
just gonna pour it out on a random
plates as you can see there's a bunch of
little clumps and you don't want that so
I'm just separating it all by hand so
that when you roll the little truffles
on the coconut it doesn't get all clumpy
and stuff all right so now it is time to
prepare the chocolate so the first thing
you need is some kind of cup or mug or
anything that you will melt it in also
here are two examples of chocolate they
can use this one from Toll House or tall
house whatever you call it or there's
this one from Baker's and this is the
one that I'm gonna be using I definitely
recommend it because it's really good
and they come in little cubes so just
kind of throw them into the cup and
we're gonna be microwaving these now the
way that I did it was I first put it in
for 30 seconds and then I mixed it and
then I put it for ten more and mixed it
and ten more and mix it so I just kept
doing it for ten seconds until it kind
of reached the consistency that I wanted
it to so yeah make sure you do not over
boil it because that would be bad so
just keep checking it frequently so once
your chocolate is all melted set that
aside and pull out your frozen little
balls and the best way that I like to do
this is dip it in there with a spoon and
kind of roll it around to cover it with
the chocolate then I'm going to kind of
pick it up stick a toothpick into the
ball and then place it on to the coconut
and just kind of start rolling it around
and patting the coconut on the little
truffle it's super important to do this
fast so as you keep doing more and more
you kind of get the hang of it and
you'll get a lot better
so the first tries that I did it kind of
didn't really work out but as I kept
doing it I got better at it
so once you've got all the little balls
I'm just going to put them on a plate as
you can see here and I like to put them
in the fridge for at least 10 minutes
just to kind of let the chocolate harden
so that you know the dough is nice and
kind of safe in there so after ten
minutes I'm going to place them on my
little display plates to kind of make it
pretty and stuff and yeah so just like
watch that so these are super cute
little treats that you can bring to a
party I'm actually bringing them for
tonight but I definitely recommend to
keep them in the refrigerator when
you're not serving them to keep them
cold and fresh and I don't think they
last for that long probably a couple
days just from my common sense so yeah
just make sure to serve them probably
the day you make them so I hope you guys
enjoyed it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
