going to be doing a Christmas haul
because seriously almost all of you guys
requested to do this and I wasn't
planning on doing it at all but I kind
of realized how much you guys want to
see this so I just decided to do it so
today I'm just gonna show you guys what
I got for Christmas and first I want to
start out by saying that I know on my
vlog Channel I made a video saying that
I wasn't really asking for anything for
Christmas which is true because I got my
video camera recently and I just kind of
thought okay well that's my Christmas
present so I didn't really ask for
anything else but um so I didn't like
know I was gonna get anything else but I
was kind of surprised because I did get
some other things on Christmas and Santa
surprised me so just want to say that
because so many girls are retweeting me
and you guys were like okay yeah I
thought you weren't getting anything
else for Christmas and no it's just that
an aspirant Elsa so everything that I
got was kind of like unexpected so the
first thing I just want to show you guys
two things that I got at Walgreens um
few girls always want to see new things
that I buy so I just kind of decided to
include it in here so first off I just
got some brown of bobby pins because I
use these all the time and I have to get
some and then also I got the Loreal
voluminous million lashes um my mascara
was running out and it was getting old
so I have to get a new one and I've
heard some pretty good stuff about this
one so I just decided to get it okay so
basically every single year me and my
best friends we have a Christmas party
my friend Neil a host of Christmas party
and it's basically what we do is we play
The Secret Santa game and that's
basically where you put all of your
names on little
and then everyone chooses a name and
basically you're a secret santa to that
person that you picked so everybody
receives one gift and everybody gives
one and my secret santa was Elise so I
wanna trade a dress that she got me I
absolutely love what she got me so thank
you so much Lise
um so the first thing is this is kind of
a thing that she made for everyone but
it's a little homemade ornament and
Cheryl I heart BBS 2010 Elise and I just
want to show you guys that so yeah I
think he was like you she made it match
my room and she said I heart BBS and
that like describes me okay so I thought
that's cute so then she got me two
things from Sephora so the first thing
she got me was the Urban Decay eyeshadow
primer potion and I was so so so so
excited when I got this because I
seriously think I was like the only girl
on YouTube that didn't have this so I'm
really happy that I finally got one of
my own so I got that and also I got this
which this is gonna be very very useful
and I'm very happy about it and this is
just a daily makeup brush cleanser and
basically what you do is you just spray
it on your brushes and wipe them on
towel so it's kind of like spot cleaning
and I think this is really useful
because I do makeup on other people like
I do makeup by my mom I've done makeup
on girls for homecoming and stuff like
that so that's why this is great so you
can just like wash your brushes if
you're going to use your own brushes on
them so this was really really cute and
last thing I got from her was a zip-up
sweatshirt from Victoria's Secret I
don't have any pink things so I was
really happy about that and it's just a
zip up and then the back looks like this
so yeah I really really love it because
it's like that really soft material on
the inside and you just want to like
sleep in it it's so cozy so that's what
I got from our little secret santa party
so just want to incorporate that into
this video because it's kind of related
so now I'm gonna show you guys what I
got
actually for Christmas and once again I
didn't really ask for this stuff but my
parents did know some things that I've
been like thinking of getting or wanting
and stuff like that so the first thing
that I got which you guys probably
notice in the back is this lamp right
here and you guys knew that I want to
get this and that it was unlike my
little sorry it was on my little
checklist for things that I need to get
from our room still so here's the box
but it's just the like re style damask
floor lamp from Target and it was really
easy to put together I put it together
by myself and yeah I really really liked
it so I got that and I was super happy
about that
I got some every party bitch jeans
because I my mom knew that I have to get
more jeans and I really really like
these like I used to be in love with
like dark skinny jeans then I forgot how
much I love like light blue jeans and
these are like super ripped off and
stuff wait so yeah they look like that
and they're just white skinny jeans so I
really really like those nice they still
smartest or I love a love this amount of
like every party
so then also I got these two and I've
been wanting this for a long time and I
don't know why I ever bought them but
they are the Burt's Bees shampoo and
conditioner you guys know that I'm
obsessed with Burt's Bees I really
really love that company so this is just
the pomegranate and soy conditioner and
the shampoo and these are very
volumizing that's what they say so yeah
kind of need that cuz my hair is pretty
thin so yeah really happy about that
so that also I got some things from
Victoria's Secret first off I got a bra
and it's just like grey and then like
pink on the inside so also another thing
I got were yoga pants and I was so happy
because I've been wanting these for a
while because these are like the
comfiest things in the whole world so I
just got once with the dark purple strap
and on the back it just says pink in
like that jersey mesh pattern so it
looks like that and they're just black
and if you guys have never tried yoga
pants for Victoria gray you have to put
some on there the comfiest things ever I
love them so I got those and then also
my brother Marcin he gave me a Best Buy
gift card so thank you so much Marcin so
the last thing that I got was just some
money for my dad and I actually spent
that money yesterday and I bought myself
a carpet or a rug for my room from
Target calm and it still hasn't come
into the mail yet I didn't know if I
should wait to make this haul until I
got the carpet but you girls said
whatever I don't want to wait for this
video so I just decided to do it without
it but it turned out to be exactly like
the money that I got for Christmas
ended up being exactly the amount I
needed for the rug that I want for my
room so I was really really happy about
that it was like destiny and yeah so I'd
say that's kind of like a part of my
Christmas present too because it's I
bought that rug with the money that I
got for Christmas
um so yeah that's about it for my
Christmas haul you guys know that I'm
not trying to brag here or anything
you guys might have thought that I got a
lot this year and sneakers and I think
that I barely got any things so I don't
know but I'm really thankful for what I
got and that's it that's all I got for
Christmas so I'll talk to you guys for
another video and I'll see you guys
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
