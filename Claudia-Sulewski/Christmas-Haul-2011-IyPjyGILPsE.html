Christmas for those of you who celebrate
Christmas and if you don't then happy
holidays and I'm actually in my robe
right now so I'm super like warm and
cozy right now uh-huh
and yeah today I'm going to be doing my
Christmas haul and I'm super excited to
do it because I did last year and I got
such great feedback from it and it was
super requested to do it this year again
so that's what I'm doing here today and
also I just want to quickly mention that
you know I'm not trying to brag or show
off anything that I got or anything like
that I'm super grateful for everything
that I got today was probably one of the
best Christmases ever I didn't expect a
lot of things that I got so I was super
grateful for that so yeah I'm trying to
keep this intro short and sweet and
simple and to the point so let's get on
with the Christmas haul okay so the
first thing is I got a card and this was
for my dad it looks like this and it
makes really cute sound so he just gave
me some money and then the first actual
present that I got is a little Fievel at
juicy perfume because I've been wanting
this for so long
I love the smell of this and I never
bought it for myself so I asked for it
this year and I got a little cute
perfume so yeah oh my gosh it smells so
good I'm so so so so happy for this so
next I got two boxes from Victoria's
Secret and I was just like oh my
goodness okay so the first thing I
actually asked for it and it was a
pajama set from Victoria Secret you know
like the silk kind kind of but yeah I
got exactly the one that I wanted
so this is the top part looks like this
it's just kind of like I think it's made
out of polyester but it feels like that
silky kind of satin material and then
also you get the matching pants with it
so it looks like this and then there's
just cuffs at the bottom and I was
wearing these around this morning and
stuff but I took them off and just put
on a robe for this video so that I could
show you it so I got that oh my gosh I
was so excited to wear it so the next
box from Victoria's Secret
oh my goodness I wasn't expecting this
at all but I actually got the Victoria's
Secret Fashion Show
NYC 2011 robe oh my goodness when I saw
this I like freaked out because I did
not expect this at all like I thought it
was sold out everywhere because it's
like limited edition this is actually
the robe that all the models wore behind
stage I think and it's just a hot pink
robe and that same material as the
pajama pants
it's just oh so pretty and then in the
front as BS and oh my gosh I love it so
much so that's what I got from Santa
from Victoria's Secret
then from my brother Marcin I got a
shirt from him from All Saints and this
is how it looks
tada
looks like that it's super cute I love
kind of like that boxy shape to it that
you can just wear with like skinny jeans
and it has like wording on here and
stuff like that
and I like it a lot isn't that really
cute tissue paper I didn't know that I
thought that was like you but yeah
thanks Merson so much for this shirt
he's probably not gonna end up watching
this video but yeah I love it a lot so
there's that so then the last thing that
I got from Christmas is this little bag
right here that says mostly nice
just a - looks like that and I just got
random little stuff so the first thing
is hairspray and I've actually not had
hairspray for a long time because I ran
out and I never bought a new one so it
was kind of like perfect timing and this
is from the Michael I think it's Oh Oh
rope Brant I don't really know how to
pronounce that but it looks like this
and I actually have the shampoo and
conditioner for this brand the it's like
madness moisture shampoo and conditioner
or something and it comes in a really
cool bottle and I actually like it a lot
so I'm super excited to try this out
because I've had really good like
experience with that company so far yeah
so the next thing that bag is a
microfiber Harrods turban and I've
always wanted to try one of these it
just basically like a hair wrap before
you know you have one hair next I got an
eye mask and I've actually been wanting
one for a really really long time now
and this is the Bucky ultra light sleep
mask it comes like this and this is
seriously the cutest and funniest thing
ever does this not look like a bra for
your eyes like a bra for your face many
my family were laughing about that but
this is like the coolest thing ever
because it has like a little ziplock not
simple velcro right here and then on the
inside it has like kind of like an
indent where your eyes are so you can
actually open your eyes while you're
wearing it and it won't your eyelashes
won't touch or anything and that's
probably the best thing about this
because I hate eye masks that force your
eyelids down I don't know why and also
you know if you forget to wash off your
eye makeup this won't get dirty because
it doesn't touch your eyes it just like
cups them I guess I don't know like a
bra but love this so much then did the
last three things that came in is bad
our makeup remover wipes and pads stuff
like that and I was actually really
really happy about this there's buzz
okay because I've always run out of
makeup remover oh my gosh
all the time so I'm super excited for
that so I just got two of these little
wipes and then also these this is like
my favorite makeup remover ever they
just come in little okay well it's not
random they just come in little like
cotton pads like that and I'll obsessed
with these I love them so much so yeah I
haven't gotten these in a really really
long time so excited to get back into
using these so that is it for my
Christmas haul so you guys might think
that it wasn't a lot or some of you guys
might think that it was a lot but I'm
just really really grateful for
everything and I did not expect to get
um you know all stuff that I didn't ask
for and I only asked for the perfume the
pyjama SAP and also I wanted a blender
but I didn't get a blender which is all
good because I have money to like go buy
a blender now so I'm just gonna go buy
my own blender but yeah so make a video
response or comment below what you guys
got for Christmas I would love to know
