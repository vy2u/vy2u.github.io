very excited about today's video because
I'm participating and encouraging you
guys to join a campaign that will help
our environment and yes we are talking
about clothes in order to reduce the
environmental impact that the fashion
industry has we have to limit the amount
of waste that we're making as well as
save the natural resources found in the
actual fabric itself I could not believe
it when I first read this but saving one
single t-shirt saves two thousand and
100 liters of water this is when your
ears should start picking up because
every single person can make such a
difference to this planet so I probably
want to cover what's world recycle week
is basically from April 18th to the 24th
all H&amp;amp;M stores will be partaking in a
new global campaign called world recycle
week so within that time period you can
head to any of your nearest hmm stores
and drop off any of the clothes or
garments that you no longer want 99% of
the clothes collected will be a reward
reused and recycled I personally think
this is such a good idea for such a huge
company to be part taking in so the
second they asked me to spread the news
and work on this with you guys
i 100% want to be involved now i know
that going through your closets and
trying to organize everything out can be
very overwhelming and you kind of don't
know where to start so today i want to
give you guys a few tips on how you can
organize your closets and clean out the
things that you don't need and you could
possibly don't string rollers like a
week or in general throughout the year
boop-boop-boop plus clean out tips by
claudia tip number one is to start on
one side and continue in one direction
so if you have a flat closet that just
goes in one line start to the left make
your way to the right if you have more
of a walk-in closet start in one spot
and work clockwise my second step is to
go through every single piece in your
closet and mentally categorize them
under keep not in season or unsure and
if you have to physically throw them
into huge piles that also always works
after that I would recommend to take a
quick break and clear your thoughts
because you've been looking at so many
pieces of clothing it's
to wait about 20 minutes nothing too
crazy and come back with a fresh
approach in mindset after that is time
to go through all of the three
individual piles that made so start off
by organizing all of the clothes that
you've put in your key pile and throw
them back into your closet place you're
not in season items somewhere in storage
where it's easy to reach but you don't
necessarily need it at this time of year
and then afterwards it is time to tackle
the not sure pile of clothing they can
get very stressful and overwhelming
trying to get rid of clothing because
you attach so many memories to certain
pieces and you don't want to let go
because it's a feeling of nostalgia what
I'm personally going through this
process I like to ask myself specific
questions to every single individual
piece for starters is a damage does it
have any rips stains tears things like
that when was the last time you actually
wore that clothing item would you
actually wear it today and most
importantly when you look at that
clothing item does it bring you
happiness does it make you smile are you
happy to have it in your closet usually
by the time I've asked myself those
questions I can decide whether I want to
keep the clothing item or not in
correlation to the world recycle week
campaign I decided that I'm going to
film a rehaul for you guys which is
basically where I show you guys a few
pieces that I have personally decided to
get rid of and donate to help the
environment also this may give you guys
some inspiration or ideas of what you
can donate so first starters if you got
any socks that have lost their companion
their other half you can totally donate
them I don't even remember the last time
I wore this fuzzy sock and the reason
why is because I can't find the other
one this skirt was such a trusty skirt
back in the day it's just a long striped
maxi skirt and you probably can't tell
from this far away
but there's just a lot of limp balls
rolled up on it and I just have worn
this in so long because I have just worn
it so many times and so I think it's
time to pass it on
so this next one I am definitely guilty
for and I feel like a lot of you guys
can also relate to this issue but I have
a lot of just the same pieces in general
multiples of the same shirt and I
usually end up wearing the one shirt
that is actually my favorite out of all
of those same shirts just a simple white
v-neck I own so many of these and I
don't need to I would rather this shirt
find its second home where it actually
gets to be used and doesn't just sit in
my closet and collect dust
I am totally also guilty for this as
well but I own a lot of clothes that are
just super old and don't even fit me
anymore
I always tell myself off one day you're
gonna squeeze back into those jeans but
I never did these are super old just
skinny light wash gray jeans and it is
time to let him go guys I feel like I am
losing weight off of my shoulders right
now another great category to go through
is all of the rams and t-shirts that you
have this is just a shirt from my
driver's ed class way back when I was
like 15 years old why is it still here
with me today I must have thought this
was a cute memory or something but I
don't wear this I don't I don't need it
in my life I'm sure I have ten other
gift shop t-shirts just thrown in there
that I can still get rid of so that is
it for today's rehaul and advice video
hopefully you guys enjoyed it and
hopefully some of you feel motivated to
go and donate some of your unwanted
clothes to any H&amp;amp;M store from April 18th
to the 24th I know today's video is
pretty shorts but I think it's important
to talk about this stuff every so often
and remind people that even just
recycling one t-shirt does so much to
maintain and help our environment so
yeah hopefully you guys enjoyed today's
video and I'll see you guys for a new
one next week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
