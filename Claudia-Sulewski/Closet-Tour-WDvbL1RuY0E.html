two most requested videos our room tour
and tour of my closet so today I'm going
to be doing one of those and I'm going
to be doing my closet tour slash
organizational just you know the way I
organize my clothes and stuff and I
decided to separate these two so that my
room term won't be too long and I will
be doing my room tour soon hopefully but
first I just gotta like organize it and
stuff like that but um I decided to
separate them because I finished
cleaning my closet and like I finished
with that so I decided to just do that
anyway and I didn't want my room tour to
be too long like over ten minutes cuz
you know I'm not partner so I just
decided to separate them so I hope you
guys enjoy my little closet tour and yes
so keep watching alright so this is my
closet and it's actually two closets
unlike both sides but what I did was I
kept the doors open so it looks like one
huge closet and like when you walk in it
looks like a walk-in closet here let me
just show you guys so you walk in it
basically feels like a walk-in closet
and then you close the door behind you
and you're in like this little area and
then up top here I have my light and
then I have like two paintings that I
painted so first let me start on these
two front doors so first off on this
door I have just all my sunglasses then
on that door I have this little like
circle hook thing and I just keep my
belts like fold it over it and yeah then
on these two doors here I just have this
like white shirt type of thing with this
wooden necklace and then here I just
have a random tank top
so this is the first closet this is the
one on the right side so up here I have
right so actually up there I have just a
bunch of boxes of like old clothes and
like my dance shoes and just random kind
of things from the past then over here I
have my shirts so I've long-sleeve and
most of mine are like tucked away boxes
since it's summertime so I only have a
couple of long sleeves than I've short
sleeves and then I have tank tops and
I've a lot of tank tops and then extra
hangers then down there I have like most
of my hoodies and jackets and not
jackets but like sweaters and like zip
up sweaters and just a random FedEx box
um so that's like shirts and sweaters so
that's like my top drawer sorta then
when you turn around you've got this
closet and it might look a little crazy
but I actually know where everything is
so down there is just like a backpack so
there's nothing special down there but
right here I have like this little bar
and I just have skirts that are like nan
jean skirts and I just kind of hang them
down there then I have this little bin
right here and in the first little
drawer I have just plain t-shirts and
tank tops that don't really have any
wording on them so I have some v-necks
and just like random t-shirts that I
don't want to like hang up or whatever
then in this second drawer I have tank
tops and then I have big t-shirts so or
like any like pajama t-shirt then in
there it's sort of like my personal
drawer so I've got personal things in
there so I'm not going to open it and
then down here I have pj pants so i have
like long pants and shorts just pants
that i wouldn't wear in public but i
would wear it to bed so then going up
onto this first like a little shelf
thingamajig i have material pants that I
like to lounge around in I'm a huge
sweats girl so I have mainly a lot from
Victoria's Secret like I have the same
pants in different colors like
it's getting ridiculous but um I love
these kind of pants they're so
comfortable and Victoria Secret is like
my favorite brand then over here I have
my two babies these are both of my juicy
daydreamers and I don't really hang
these like my other purses because I
feel like after a while they kind of
lose their shape and like the bottom
droops down it's really weird so I like
to lay them on this rack like I said
after this one because it's old but this
is my new one that's how they look pink
and brown and then black and like neon
and stuff then going up you have this
mini shelf and I've just got some jean
shorts and like material shorts just I
like to fold all my shorts up here so
it's easy to go for them then up there I
have just long jeans that I don't know I
don't really use during summertime and
then up here I have this bin of just
like fun stuff like long socks and
leggings and all that stuff and then up
there I just have boxes and more purses
that I don't really use and then I have
this bar right here and it droops down
so I've got like pants and dresses and
like Sun dresses and more skirts and
more dresses just kind of maybe like
more fancier stuff kind of like more
dressy things and yeah that's it for my
closet tour so that's that side and now
let me turn around and that's that side
now we're gonna go out of my closet see
this is how my closet is supposed to
look when I close all of my drawers so
it looks like that now
so there's closet one in closet two then
when you go around here I also have this
little like station type of thing and I
have to keep most of my like purses and
like accessories in here so first I have
this like beige material bin
and I just like to keep like fancy
sandals and flats and flip-flops in my
like crazy like black and colorful
Condors that are like crazy and just
shoes that I like don't wear everyday
then over here I have my cowboy boots
that I love so much and then I have this
thing now I have no idea where I bought
this I mean where my parents bought this
I just found it in my basement and I
decided to take it up into my room but
my mom shops a lot at like antique
places and antique markets and stores
and stuff like that so you could
probably find something similar to this
so I've just got this like bangle kind
of just hanging put that up there so I
have this juicy bag you've guys seen
this before if you saw my older videos
it's like cute and summery and I also
have this juicy bag and it's just
chocolate brown and blue then I keep
just two headbands on here they're like
more fancier I've got some fancier belts
over here I have another juicy bag this
is like a smaller one then I have a gap
bag which I actually love taking it
around because it's very casual and then
I have no idea what about this this is
like a hand-me-down from like my mom or
something but I don't know worried about
that it's just a gray bag then up here I
just have like sleeping masks and a
bigger headbands and then over here
sounds like an egg wallet just some
rings and like necklaces just random -
really that maybe I like to wear more
often and then I have my director hat
and you can see my mirror so that's it
for that little thing and then that's
