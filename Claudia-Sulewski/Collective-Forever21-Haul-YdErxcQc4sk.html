a collective haul from forever 21 and
this is the stuff that I have button
within the past month and a half to two
months so yeah I've got quite a bit of
things to show you guys so I don't
really want to bore you with the long
intro but also I'm sorry that the
lighting is really blue the settings on
my camera are just being really weird
it's a it's either I'm blue like this
I'm really Orange and I decided that I
don't want to look like a bus so I just
went with the blue settings and yeah so
everything in this video mentioned is
going to be from forever 21
hence collective forever 21 haul but
yeah let's just get right into it so the
first thing that I'm going to be showing
you guys is this robe and it's just a
white fluffy robe that I'm completely in
love with and I got this before
Christmas so I didn't even know that was
getting another rope but I needed a new
one you either way so it's just really
fluffy I like you a lot because it has
pockets on both sides but also it has a
hood on the back which is really awesome
and this rope was only 18 dollars like
1850 or something so next I only got one
pair of pants and they look like this
they're black sparkly sequency shorts
super cute I'm thinking of bringing them
for New Year's not really sure but these
were 2280 and I just looked like that
then I just got one dress and I'm
absolutely in love with this dress it's
so cute it looks like this is just coral
and white striped it's kind of like a
ready coral but it's very nice and
fitting to the body it has it really
nice like appropriate length so this is
definitely the type of dress that I
would wear to school and also the
sleeves have like I like 1/4 to 1/2
length sleeves so it looks very cute I
wish I got this some more colors cuz I'm
so obsessed with it but yeah it just
looks like that and this dress was only
twelve fifty which is an amazing deal
alright so next I'm going to be showing
you guys all the shirts that I got and I
got a lot of shirts which I'm very happy
about so the first one is this
right here it is navy blue and it just
has kind of that cool pattern on it and
the sleeves have that little button that
kind of buttons at the side so they're
kind of like halfway length sleeves in
this shirt I think was like 15 bucks on
our leisure and as I show you guys the
shirts you will notice how many simple
shirts I got but I'm kind of going
through a phase right now or just like
really plain shirts with just like
skinny jeans so the next one is this
black shirt and it is a button-down
shirt and then also has half voice
halfway length sleeves again like the
other one and it just looks like that it
looks kind of weird on camera but it's
really cute in person and so this shirt
I think was like 15 dollars as well so
then I ended up getting the same exact
shirt in a different color as well
because I really like it but this one is
in a light gray so you can kind of see
it better it has pockets and just
buttons and then it has the same kind of
sleeves that like button at the sides so
I like it a lot
so then I got this shirt and this was
from Heritage which is like the same
thing as forever 21 because it's like by
the same people and it looks like this
it's just very simple it's a white shirt
and it kind of has the whole quarter
length sleeves pretty much every shirt I
got has like the halfway length sleeves
but it looks like this black sleeves
it's really simple and nice I think this
was like $11 an hour Lee sure I'm sorry
the next shirt is this blue one right
here and it kinda looks like a grandma
or grandpa shirt but it's really pretty
it kind of looks like a cardigan but
these buttons don't undo so it's like a
shirt but I like it a lot because it
goes really long in the back and really
short in the front so it looks really
pretty I've already worn this a couple
times with like jeans and then also I
got the same exact shirt in a different
color I know I'm so weird but this is
more of like a tan kind of light brown
color and I like this one a lot it will
match with a lot of stuff so I decided
to go with it and also I really like the
material of this shirt this was really
well made so next I just got a white
tank top from forever 21 I don't know I
needed one that was just plain and white
and stuff
I just got one and this was probably
like 280 I think I don't know but
they're tank tops and just plain shirts
are really cheap so it's nice so then
the last couple of shirts are all
Phoenix so the first one is just regular
white v-neck and this is in medium and I
wanted a medium because I wanted kind of
like a looser one that's a little bit
more loose fitting I could tuck it into
like my jeans or something or tuck into
a belt I don't know but yeah I just want
to get kind of a looser one but then I
also got another white one and this is a
small one so it's a little bit more
fitting so yeah I like weight Phoenix a
lot so that's why I got them in two
different sizes and then the last shirt
I got was another v-neck but this is
kind of like a charcoal grey color it's
not really picking up on camera just
because the lighting is really weird but
this shirt was only 480 so I'm guessing
that's how much together once more - but
it just looks like this and this is a
small so I don't know I like it a lot
just very nice kind of sophisticated
dark grey color well I honestly feel
like I flew through that I know my holes
aren't usually so so long but I'm trying
to speed this one up a bit because I
know that some of you hate really long
videos so the next couple things that
might be showing you guys are all
accessories which is probably my
favorite part of this haul so the first
thing are these boots right here and
yeah they look like this they're just
like black combat boots I guess but they
sit down the side there are only $40
which is super amazing for boots and
they also have four on the inside so you
can fold it down like this if you want
or you can just leave it up like that so
I love these oh my gosh I cannot wait to
wear these when I get back to school so
I got those only $40 so then also I got
a bunch of underwear but I'm not going
to show you guys that because that's
just that's weird and then also I got
these fuzzy socks that are pink with
like white polka dots on them but
they're dirty right now so I couldn't
show you guys how they look but also
yesterday I got two different socks and
these are kind of longer ones
so the first look like this and they
were 380 and they're just kind of this
creamy brown color
I got these because first of all they're
really thick and nice and warm and also
they're long so that I can scrunch them
and kind of peek them out of my boots
because I don't have any long socks and
I want sucks to do that so that also I
got these gray socks which are also
really long and these are also 380 so
then also I got a belt and I bought this
online and I had no idea what size I was
for belts but thank goodness I got the
perfect size so it looks like this in
the front it has just kind of like a
chestnut brown leather in the front and
then on the back it just has black and
white striped pattern and they're also
really stretchy so I think it's perfect
cuz it will fit a lot of people and this
belt was only five dollars and eighty
cents that is like really really cheap
for a belt so I was super excited when I
saw this online so then I only got one
pair of Julie yeah I haven't gotten a
lot in a while but I got these earrings
right here so they look like this and
they're just studs and I kind of nudie
it's like a nudey pink color and there's
just a bunch of roses and I think
they're so cute it was like 280 I
believe or like three dollars or
something on my leisure so I've only got
two more things to show you guys and
they are both purses so the first one is
this white one right here I got it
online and it's kind of like a creamy
off-white I'm sorry I'm gonna go close
my window so anyways umm it looks like
this it has really pretty gold detailing
I wanted it because I don't have a purse
that has gold detailing on it
and it looks like this it has zippers
kind of in the front that go vertically
the inside just looks like that and it
just looks like that I'm really excited
to start using it it has a regular strap
like this but then it also has a longer
one so you can kind of carry it
crisscross or you could just carry it on
your shoulder
so yeah this was I think either $29 or
$20 it was like twenty to thirty dollars
I don't know
then the last person I got is
my favorite and it's this little satchel
right here and it just looks like this I
don't know why but it kind of reminds me
of Chanel
so this strap is not adjustable but
that's okay it looks like this it's kind
of like golds and braided looking like
that and it just opens up like that and
this purse was $22.80
so practically 23 bucks which is a
pretty good deal if you ask me and I
like it a lot it's really cute I think
you'll match to a lot of stuff since
it's a nude color and I just really
wanted a nude bag so I think this was
kind of like the perfect thing okay so
that is it for today's collective haul I
hope you guys enjoyed it kind of well if
you guys want me to do more hauls so if
