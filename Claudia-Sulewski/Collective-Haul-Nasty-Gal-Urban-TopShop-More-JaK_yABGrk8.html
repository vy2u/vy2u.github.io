a collective haul and I have done quite
a bit of shopping this summer I
definitely did not buy all this within
like one time period this was kind of
over the past two months ish I'm gonna
start off by showing you guys what I've
gotten from Nasty Gal comm which is one
of my favorite clothing websites so
first off this is probably my most
favorite piece out of like everything
that I've gotten it's this white dress
right here
so it's a short flowy sleeveless dress
and it has kind of like a sweetheart
neckline and then also you can see here
it has like a floral crochet kind of
strip going underneath the bust area
that goes all the way around and it is
just so pretty I'm probably gonna wear
it at VidCon because I'm just so excited
and it just next up I got this top right
here and it's just black and white and
it has like geometric patterns on it and
I really like the back because it's
zippered and it also has like faux
leather going down the zipper so I
thought that was a really nice touch and
I don't know it's kind of different but
I thought it'd be really cute with like
white shorts or something next up I got
this black bralette type of thing and it
might be hard to see but it's like
crossed in the front and then there's
like kind of little slits on the sides
but you can't really see them when
you're wearing it but it's just like a
little crop top thing it looks so weird
when it's not on but it's really cute
and it looks really cute with circle
skirts or any high-waisted skirts so I
thought it was just a nice kind of basic
piece to have in my wardrobe next up I
got this striped sweater and it reminded
me a lot of brandy melville because it's
very lightweight it's very soft and I
really like wearing it at nighttime when
it gets colder so yeah I like this a lot
I just realized everything I bought from
Nasty Gal was either white or black all
the comments are gonna be like Claudia
why don't you wear color I'm sorry next
up I got this white striped crop top and
I really liked it because if you can see
it's actually
see through so this looks really cute
with like a bando underneath I also wore
this over like my bright purple bando
bathing suit as like a cover up shirt
and it looked so adorable and then
lastly I got this white spaghetti strap
top it's got like a V cut and it also
has a really cute crochet like lacing at
the bottom and I thought you'd look
really cute with like maxi skirts and
stuff next up I got a few things from
Urban Outfitters and recently I went to
the best sale ever it was like 50% off
these sale items it literally could not
have gotten any better like I'm pretty
sure we're in the store for three hours
I would say um so the first stop I got
looks like this and this actually wasn't
on sale it was like $44 which is really
expensive in my opinion but it was just
so cute I couldn't like not buy it so
the back has I don't know if you guys
can see but it has like little holes in
it and then the front just has this
really really pretty like metallic
design on it I just think it's adorable
next up I got these high-waisted shorts
and I've been eyeing these for a very
very long time but I just never felt
like buying them when I was at the store
but these were marked down to $20 and
with the extra 50% off these are only
$10 how amazing is that honestly and
they fit so perfectly I'm so happy with
these shorts it went from being 54
dollars to $10 Lee amazes me then I also
got these high-waisted shorts and I only
paid $15 for these so I was really
excited about that and I just have a
really pretty like rose pattern on the
sides in like a cream color and they're
just a light wash next up I got this
floral romper which looks so adorable
it's like an olive green color and it
just has roses on it and it's very
pretty it's just very flattering on and
it's the perfect piece for summer
can you guys hear that movie
I'm so sorry can you turn it down I'm
filming a video thank you
I also got this long-sleeve brown
t-shirt for only five dollars it's just
very casual and comfy and soft so I
thought it would be really cute with
just jeans or leggings on a very casual
day next up I bought a few things from
go Jane comm so first off I got these
all black sneakers right here and I've
always wanted to try out like all black
sneakers but I was always scared because
I didn't know if they would look good on
me or not but I'm pretty sure that these
were only like ten to 12 dollars so they
were super inexpensive so I just decided
hey why not and buy them and I'm still
working on it I wore them once and they
looked really cute but I don't know I
don't know how I feel about these yet
but so far I like them so then I also
got three pairs of shorts because I love
love love their shorts they fit me so
well so the first pair it looks like
this they're just acid wash so they're
super crazy and they're high-waisted
these are all high-waisted my next pair
is just all black because I actually did
not own any black shorts and I feel like
these are kind of like a staple piece so
had to get those then the last pair
looks like this
they're just bleach dip dyed ombre
whatever you want to call this and I
think these are adorable next up I have
two things from American Apparel so
first off I have these shorts right here
kind of crazy but I thought they were so
pretty they're kind of like a tropical
floral design with some penguins or not
penguins flamingos on them and I thought
they were just so fun and colorful and I
also got this chunky sweater which may
look kind of weird on camera but it's
just it's very plain but it's just it's
so cozy and thick and I love it I
weren't like two days ago because it's
kind of colder right now I don't know
why I don't like it but I wore this with
leggings and I absolutely love it
because it's like gray on the inside so
I like roll up the sleeves a little bit
and I don't know something about it it's
so plain but for some reason I love it
next up I got a few pieces from icing
which is a jewelry store and a few weeks
ago I went to the opening of the icing
on State Street in Chicago and I was
very impressed with the store because
they've recently kind of remade their
whole look I seems to be very similar to
Claire's I mean then by the same company
except they were kind of like the same
store but recently they have decided to
kind of revamp icing and direct it more
towards kind of like an older audience
so I was very very impressed with
everything in the store so I just want
to show you a few the things that I
picked out so first off I got this
bracelet right here it's a little brown
wrap bracelets and I love wearing red
bracelets so much I wear them every
single day
and this one just has a cross and
infinity sign as well as a braid so I
thought this would go really well with
all of my jewelry then I also got this
long necklace which is knotted hello
there you go it just has a really cute
white triangle stone but I think it's so
cute and it's definitely gonna work with
a lot of my pieces next up I got this
gold ring with a white stone in the
middle and it's very simple but I love
wearing rings so much and I don't know I
just thought this one was really cute
even though it's really simple I was
very excited for this right next up I
got this set of twisty ties it came with
three of them a black gray and white one
and I really wanted to get these because
they're made of lace all the twisty ties
that I own are made out of like this
stretchy ribbon material and I've never
seen twisty ties that were made out of
lace but it's still stretchy so I don't
know I just thought it looked really
cool and I'm excited to wear it because
I just think it looks really cute on
your wrist lastly I got these glasses
right here they kind of look like the
Ray Ban style of glasses but these have
a floral pattern on the side both on the
inside and outside so I thought these
were very cute for the summertime to
help spice up an alpha
because usually when outfits are very
bland and neutral you guys would know
that so this is a great way to kind of
add like a pop of color so they look
like this
even just like having them on your head
it looks so pretty next up I have a few
things from Topshop which is one of my
favorite clothing stores ever and one of
the times when I went there they were
having an awesome sale so a lot of this
stuff I got for a very good price so for
example I got all of these tanks on sale
I think for like five dollars each or
ten I think it was five I'm not sure but
it was like a really really good price
so they're all the same like style and
cut but they're all just different
patterns so this one is just striped it
reminded me of Miley Cyrus I don't know
why I just feel like she would wear
something like this so I got this one
and then I also got a black one with
white polka dots I thought this was so
cute and then also I got this one which
is kind of crazy I don't even know how
to explain it but it looks like that and
this one actually looks so cool with
like jean shorts just looks very nice I
also got this dress
it's a ha it looks like this it's a
cream-colored
short flowy dress and it just has little
crocheted cutouts on the sides and I
just thought it was very pretty and
girly I love these kind of dresses
actually a duck's here on YouTube she
was like Claudia that is you and a dress
you need to buy that and I was like wow
you were so right so I bought it because
it's beautiful but I also got another
dress and let me just say I am in love
with this dress um I've already worn it
to the icing opening that I was talking
about earlier so I I don't know what I'm
gonna wear it next because it's such a
bold dress so like people will remember
me in it so that makes me so sad because
I want to wear it again somewhere I'm
sure I'll find another place to wear it
but oh my god it's so pretty it looks
like this
to do so it's white and black striped
and then it has these blue and lime
green flowers going all around it and
it's just the cuts and everything is
just it's so perfect it has like a very
high neckline it's sleeveless and then
it has these cutouts right here on the
side that just I don't know it just it
looks so good on and like I could stare
at this dress all day I'm just obsessed
with it
so my last store is a brandy Melville I
have actually bought in so much brandy
melville I think I've done like three
separate orders this summer and each
order was like insanely large so I'm not
going to show like everything that I've
gotten because that would just be really
sad and pathetic and that would just
have to be like a whole video on its own
so I just decided to pull a few pieces
that I've really been liking / I just
think is really cute so I want to show
you guys so here are just a few of the
pieces that I've gotten it's I'm a sick
obsession it's not okay the first item I
want to show you guys wear these pants
right here and I've already worn them a
few times and I always get compliments
when I wear them because they are
seriously the sickest pants ever so
they're black and they're just super
long and super flowy as you can see so
it kind of looks like you're wearing a
maxi skirt when you wear them since
these are super long I like to wear them
high-waisted with a really cute like
crop top or bralette thing and it just
it looks so cute that I also got this
striped maxi skirt and I love wearing
this oh my gosh I've already worn it
like three times but it has a slit that
goes pretty far up down the side but it
also has a dress or not a dress it has
like a shorter skirt underneath yeah
there you go I also recently bought
these shorts they're just black and
flowy
sometimes I'll wear these as pajamas or
sometimes I will actually wear these out
of the house when I'm just like lounging
around like watching movies and my
friends or something so they're like
kind of see-through so like just don't
wear like bright underwear with these
and you'll be good so they're very cute
though I've actually worn like a really
cute outfits with these shorts so I like
those I also got a lot of their graphic
t-shirts so for example I got this one
which I wore in one of my recent videos
it's from brandy melville a lot of you
guys asked that question so that's where
I got that and then also this shirt
right here I'm sure you guys have seen
it before
it just says thug life and also I've
been loving I think it's pronounced Jada
dress I don't know but I love the brandy
melville Jaina dress I have this one
it's like a navy blue floral pattern and
it just has a low back and it's just
very short and flowy and it's just it's
so perfect for the beach and for the
summertime
this one is my most recent favorite it
looks like this it's like a topi light
brown color and I've been obsessed with
this one I also have fun a lot of their
jewelry it's kind of a sick obsession
like all of these bracelets and all
these rings except for this one this
one's from Topshop and then I have a few
that I haven't opened yet so I've just
got random like bracelets and rings and
whatnot I don't know their jewelry is
super inexpensive so I really like it
that actually concludes my haul I hope
you guys still look at me the same you
don't judge me for my shopping addiction
because my mom definitely does every
time a package comes in the mail I just
feel so frowned upon because my mom is
just like really Claudia again I'm like
yeah
oh I also got this sweater recently from
Ronnie model
