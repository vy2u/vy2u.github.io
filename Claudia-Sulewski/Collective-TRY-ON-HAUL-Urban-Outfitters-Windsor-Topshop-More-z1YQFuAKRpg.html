what is up you guys welcome back to my
channel it has been quite a while since
I made one of these videos today we are
doing a collection all I want to mention
that this might possibly be the last
video that I filmed in this bedroom ever
what yeah I've tweeted about this I
haven't really talked about it though
but um our lease is ending in this house
and I already have my own place I've
said least she's ready to go and I'm
moving in like four five days plus yeah
so get ready for those moving blog
enough rambling let's get into it
I'm going to start off with the beauty
related products get them all on the way
the first thing that I wanted to haul
are these bad boys right here I'm not
really entertaining I don't want to
purposely expose myself to UV rays and
just sit there and bake and so I like to
tell him and I've been using the same
champagne mousse for years now I love
that stuff I don't know why he's never
caught my eye but I've been using me
greatly
they're the say trippy bronzing mist oh
my goodness bees are a game changer it's
literally like giving yourself spray tan
at home also if you watch one of my best
friends Lauren Elizabeth she talked
about this body trick in one of her life
videos about being glowy she talks about
this like leg glowing trick and I got
everything so it works on me I purchased
the Becca shimmering skin perfecter
which is a liquid highlighter and this
is the shade of taupe ah I'm probably
butchering that but anyways you blended
with your lotion and you put it all over
you like and then you take the champagne
pop highlighter which I don't know why
it's taken me this long to buy this
highlighter because it is so beautiful
I'm wearing it on my face right now and
so what you do is you dab it in there
and just draw a mag down your leg and it
makes them look super shimmery and glowy
and I love it and I feel like there is
going to be a great trick for the
summertime so I want to talk about those
and then I have one more beauty products
that I want to talk about I have been
such a whore with skin serums and face
oil and just like every single type of
oil my bathroom looks like a skincare
product like chemistry lab I've got all
these like little bottles
little freaking droppers and I mix oils
with serums that I put them on my face I
recently got this one from fresh and I'm
obsessed with it it smells so relaxing
it is their Seabury moisturizing face
oil so all I do is go in with my regular
serum and then I take two drops of this
add that into it put it on before and do
my moisturizer and it has been
incredible getting into the clothing
portion a let's do this I wish I had a
bag to be like yeah but we don't it's
okay but I just found a way to add that
in anyways let's move on I'm going to
start off with the jeans because I
purchased a few that I feel very
passionate about and a lot of you guys
have been asking me on instagram where
they're from so first off we've got
these legs Bermuda cut shorts basically
they're fitted they're ripped up I got
these from Urban Outfitters and I
fricking love them was just like a
simple t-shirt and sneakers and it's
easy the butt looks great I love this
style
these next pair of jeans I have worn so
much and I think I've owned these for
about two weeks now oh my god I am
obsessed these are like the weirdest cut
pants I've ever worn but they're not
that weird but like like lemmings like
these are also from Urban Outfitters
it's the same brand it's called a gold I
think basically they're super distressed
pants they've got like a wide straight
cut at the bottom but they're kind of
like like they don't go all the
way to your ankle so they kind of
weirdly cut high but it also is kind of
a look so when you wear like heeled
sandals or just simple black straps
field sandals with them it looks so good
but you can also just wear converse
anyways I've been wearing these jeans
with so many different outfits lately
and they just fit so well and I'm just
I'm so happy the last pair is from
Topshop and I want to show these because
I love the top portion of them so
they're high-waisted but they've got
like a little fringe action going on
right here a little frayed so these are
going to look super cute with crop tops
where you want to actually show the
waistline they cut a little shorter so
you got the same kind of fraying at the
end and they're just super cute I'm
going to jump to jewelry real quick I
have been so obsessed with
dainty little jewelry because I'm the
type of person that like I would do a
very long phase of wearing like more
statement clothes and just like cooler
things but then I would keep it very
simple with jewelry or just not wear any
jewelry and now instead of going through
the opposite fan where I wear super
simple pieces like literally this is
just like a prop tube top but then I've
drawn a jacket and a bunch of rings and
dinky little like silver necklaces and
I'm actually wearing earrings because I
like ever used to wear earrings my
favorite place to get chokers and dainty
necklaces like this little pendant one
right here I'll have a close-up on it
but I freaking love like little diamond
necklaces like this that hang a little
lower and then stacking them with simple
chokers and stuff I get all these from
the brands are gentle Bubo I think
that's nice man said I hope I'm not
between that every single style comes in
either gold or silver so depending on
what type of person you are you got it
all so that I highly highly appreciate
and then I just have like a bunch of
rings and stuff and I mostly get those
from like Nordstrom going along with
just things that I've been wearing
lately I've been loving like little
straighter cross tube tops and tank tops
so I want to show this one from
Reformation I actually haven't worn this
one yet but it's so cute it looks like
this the little straps tie at the top
and it's just very fitted it has a very
cute girly fit to it and then similar to
that I bought this little romper
jumpsuit jumpsuit and a bunch of you
guys wondering where this is from and
it's from Reformation as well but it
just goes cuber long and flared at the
ends and I just love how the top fit
it's a little corset part right here you
can loosen or tighten so if you're going
out to dinner and you need to loosen up
those strings you're covered hi we
appreciate that yeah it's I really
really like Reformation pieces because
they're very flattering they're very
girly but they're so structured and
simple and mature I will also I I hope
you guys can hear Dexter but he's going
crazy today I am a huge fan of leotards
one pieces whatever you
call them this one I recently just got
from urban I love it it's so simple like
I feel so lame putting this up but like
I'm so excited about it because it is
simple but it's read so it's got some
texture and it just goes straight across
and since it's like a one-piece then
it's just going to tuck in really well
with like the jeans that I showed you
guys or like whatever this is a really
cool top it's also from Urban Outfitters
it's a little more dainty and bralette
esque but I think if I wear with the
right pants then I can make it look like
a shirt it's like a dusty pale pink and
it's got like the little hooks in the
front I don't know it's just adorable I
love that color for this time of year
this is a little top it's also from
urban I just freaking love getting like
simple pieces from them they're super
affordable and just cute I just love the
fit of it and I love that it kind of has
like a more modern side to it so yeah
we've got two jackets because it
actually does get cold here at night
time and you can actually get away with
wearing jackets this one I've been
getting a bunch of questions on it's a
bomber jacket from the brand love and
harmony
it just has patches all over I've been
wanting a green a bomber jacket like
this for so long but every single one
that I've seen at like Topshop and urban
well just too like poofy and then also I
found this jacket from Topshop it is so
frickin cute the fit of it is so
flattering it's like a little bit crop
but not too crossed and my favorite part
is at the end of the sleeves they both
have like little buckles around them and
so I thought that was like a really cute
detail I'm all about it I'm going to
jump to shoes real quick I just got
these heels from Windsor store online
and they're so cute they're so
comfortable I haven't worn them yet but
I'd like worn them around my room but
I'm all about like sandals like heeled
sandals that have a little strap at the
top and just you know like a very very
simple kind of gentle vibe but I loved
like the satin material and pattern on
these I think it's
perfect little spice and flare and so
these are looks super cute with like
jeans and you know one of these like
tanks that I'm showing you guys and yeah
these are damn damn cute I don't know
how we just got to the last category
because I feel like that flew by but all
I have are just some swimsuits to show
you guys the first pair I have already
worn and oh my god I just frickin love
it it's from the brand show me your
muumuu it's such a flattering piece okay
so clearly you're like what is going on
basically I'm gonna do this over my
jacket oh my god I look nude you go
across and then you tie it like this
this is hilarious it's just very cute
it's very flattering I love the color
and the pattern the bottoms are just the
same pattern and they're super
flattering the next one is from Urban
Outfitters and it's pretty cool it's a
little risque because it's very low-cut
but you can like pin it up as high as
you want anyways it's a black one piece
and it's ribbed it's super thick it
feels nice and I just really liked a
little v-neck down here I think it gave
a nice little like edge to it the last
bathing suit I want to show you guys is
actually very very simple but honestly
there's something about just like a
simple black one-piece bathing suit that
you can have like jean shorts over if
you're going to the beach or you want to
throw like a top on or a jacket I just
want to talk about this one because it's
very flattering and sometimes it's hard
to find just simple bathing suits like
this so I got this one from Reformation
I'm a size small and it is just the most
perfect little black bathing suit and it
just has like a straight cross cut super
simple it's super effective real good
stuff so I hope you guys enjoyed today's
collective haul I'm like slowly starting
to get back into buying clothes and
keeping up with that because I went
through this weird phase where I just
didn't shop for like five months which
for me is like a long time but that's
probably just normal so expect another
haul soon I feel like I'm going to start
getting more into that and then also
yeah I'm moving next week so I'm going
to be doing a bunch of moving vlogs and
my mom will also be in town for like
seven days
so I'm going to see if I can film
something with her maybe like mom does
my voiceover or server series with her
or something I don't know I'm personally
just very excited to be in a new
environment with a fresh clean space
that is my own and I feel like you know
it's time it's gonna it feels good
alright you guys I will see you for a
new video next week and I love you very
much
