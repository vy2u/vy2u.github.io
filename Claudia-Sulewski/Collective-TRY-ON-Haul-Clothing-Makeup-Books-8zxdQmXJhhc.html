channel today's video is going to be a
collective haul we've got clothing and
accessories and makeup and books
recently I accumulated a lot of things
from boohoo boohoo calm I'm sure you
guys are very familiar with them and I
don't need to make the introduction
basically they just have really fun
pieces that are on trend but they are
affordable
aka everyone is happy great for
back-to-school this is me trying to like
incorporate a back-to-school video and
it's just like no like I'm so not in
school hope you guys like the stuff that
I picked out maybe it'll inspire you for
some of your back-to-school outfits
before we get started I wanted to
mention that I teamed up with boo boo to
make this video but also we are giving
you guys a 50% off romo code 50% off not
15 5-0
my promo code is Claudia 50 I'll have
all the info and links and everything
down in the downbar as well as all the
pieces that I'll be showing you guys so
that it's super easy to find it you
don't need to like search a little bit
let's get into it shall we
starting off am I mentioned what I'm
wearing right now because I know how
many have questions on it so this is the
first piece that I got from booboo
mustard-yellow
is one of my favorite colors to wear
it's actually one piece but it gives you
like a two-piece romper vibe very into
it makes it very easy to complete an
outfit next up I got a pair of pants and
I've been wanting pants like these for
so long so they are all black and they
have got the white stripes on the sides
with the buttons that go all the way at
the top you want to go crazy
you only want two buttons three all the
way whatever you want you can totally
make this like an outing look for sure
the next thing that I want to show you
guys is probably my favorite that I'll
be showing you today I don't even know
why but like this I am so excited out
okay
it's a white crewneck and then on the
bottom we've got this little black panel
and it says we're in town but I just
love the fit of it the cut of it it's so
comfy so it's gonna be a really great
transition from like summer to fall
piece anyways I'm obsessed and oh yeah
we got some more mustard yellow slash
gold in there so very happy with that I
got to bodysuits
this is
first one I was immediately drawn to the
color it's like a topi brownie warm tone
rosy color who then can zip it down in
the front here so if you want to wear
like a cute little bra let or something
underneath and show that off or is it
all the way up next up I've got another
bodysuit for you guys it's gonna be hard
showing it cuz like it's a lot of that
movement a striped obviously black and
white and then the arms do this cross
thing where it crosses over and it's
over the shoulder you guys will see the
Tryon clip the material is really thick
and so which is kind of like you know
and it like mix it all like knives next
up I got two more casual t-shirts love
me some graphic tees so this one is
black and it says girl gang on it and
cursive but what I really liked is that
you've got little like pearls on it
how.what it's so cute it's like black
and cool it intense but then you look up
and you're like are those pearls those
are pearls I'm gonna wear it with so
many different jeans and jean shorts and
stuff next up I have another t-shirt and
this one is white and I thought it was
funny
no chance so it's just an all white
t-shirt and it says no chance in this
like bubbly font but there are sequins
on it I'm into like these little details
I love taking like comfortable casual
pieces and just like trying to get by
wearing it like out as like a fancy
thing like yeah throw a jacket on there
alright okay this next piece is a little
fancier we're gonna dull t-shirt it's
like a button-up shirt and it's lightly
striped but like the pattern changes
halfway down these kind of shirts I like
either like tucking one-sided or tucking
it all in or even like having it open
you can do a lot of fun about shirts
which is very convenient the next thing
that I want to show you guys is actually
a two-piece so they come together but
you've got these little black flowy
shorts and then the top is so cute I've
seen this everywhere but I've always
felt like I can't pull it off I don't
know I don't like this is like pretty
girly for me I mean I know I just really
what am I saying I'm excited about this
though it's one of those like off the
shoulder tops within a Tyson
right there's like a little thing going
on over there yeah there's just like
little ties and everything that I'm
getting just makes me want to go on
vacation and it's it's I'm not going
anywhere I love how these come into
super pieces because you can then wear
them with other stuff too you don't have
to wear them together next up I got two
little slide on slipper shoes type
things very very excited about these
little slippers I think they're so cute
I'm so excited to wear these these are
going to go perfectly with my wardrobe
and yeah I just love the colors of the
little flowers on them and the gold
details we're getting into gold it's a
thing lastly I want to show you guys
these sandals and I've never owned like
fancy sandals like this all my slide ons
are like rubber athletic meant for
post-workout slides so they're just all
white and they have two straps I would
definitely wear these with like an
outfit that I'm wearing right now so
those are all the pieces that I picked
up from boohoo want any of them all be
down there so excited about them I've
got a few other things I have a purse
I bought this like a few weeks ago but I
haven't talked about it there's a little
more expensive
it's from Chloe but it's like this
little brown bag before this I did not
own a brown bag which is insane I feel
like you that's like an essential what
was like doing I like literally this
right here is an outfit this is what I'm
wearing today I just love this size and
the fact that it's crossbody the gold oh
my goodness this like it's like is if it
was planned I want to show you guys a
few beauty products and I've had these
for a little bit so I've been able to
like test them out the first one is a
foundation that I've been meaning to get
for so freakin long so Giorgio Armani
luminous silk foundation I've heard so
many people talk about this there's a
video that I'm going to be using this in
I'm filming it actually later today
we'll see which one goes up sooner but
yeah I'm excited and I really really
like this foundation the next product I
want to show you guys has to do with
self-tanning because I always get
questions on that and that's also video
that I'm going to film soon it's the
better bod bronze and contour by torque
right by Tarte it's like this pigmented
kind of lotion thing but it like soaks
in right away
and it just bronzes your entire body
really good for pictures events stuff
like that the last makeup product I want
to talk about I don't know how to
pronounce this brand is it you are you
are a Jew wha what I'm just gonna stop
myself there but it's a highlighter and
it is there pH skinny-dip powder
highlighter so yeah the shade is called
skinny dip and it's just a beautiful
light gold I really really like gold
toned highlighters I think it works the
best with like my skin tone this one
actually runs me a lot of champagne pop
Rebecca oh it's it's buttery
it's soft it's milky lastly I wanted to
haul two books for you guys first one is
not so much a book but more so like a
diary type thing that you ready it's the
five minute journal I talked about this
in my vlog channel but basically it's a
five minute journal that you write in
every single morning and night if okis
eyes on the stuff that you're grateful
for and what would make today great
daily affirmations and like how could I
made today even better I've been using
this for about six days so I'm still
pretty new with it but honestly I hope I
go through this entire thing and
continue to buy them because it has
helped me become so much more present
and appreciative of all the moments that
are happening and I'm not really once
like writing Diaries and like dear diary
this happened blah blah because I can
never keep up with it with something
like this it's not as much of a
commitment and so I think it's cool it's
nice yeah the next one is an actual book
that I'm reading I'm about like halfway
through also I'm really done because I
lost the paper cover like this is the
actual book it says vows it's finally
Singh aka a super woman here on YouTube
basically in the beginning of this book
she describes what a boss means to her I
feel like I can't say boss it's false
but yeah every single chapter talks
about like a different lesson that she's
learned through life experiences and
just kind of like relatable things that
you can apply to your life like all
around being a good human being
she really covers so much through this
highly recommend loving this book and I
can't
to finish it so yeah I want to talk that
I guess that's it for today's video that
went by so much faster than I wanted it
to if you guys enjoyed today's video be
sure to give it a thumbs up and

of your day and I'll talk to you soon
