thrifting or whatever video and this is
just a brown dress from H&amp;amp;M what did I
take a finger yeah i'm just using it
pants
because I ran out of but it has a really
pretty golden detailing on the shoulders
and then it's kind of loose it doesn't
really have a shape to it but I love
matching like a gold belt to it and it's
really cute so I like that also I got
this dress which I am currently obsessed
with and this is from the brand's
imaginary voyage and its like this blue
spaghetti strap dress it's really loose
here and then goes tight here and has
pockets and what's it called I wore this
yesterday and it's so cute because i
have like I don't know what it is but I
have this brown belt that I put right
here and then I have like these brown
sandals that I put on with it too and it
looks so cute I just love the color so
love that I've really been into like
dresses more recently then I also got
this dress we're just kind of a bright
color and it looks like it'd be really
really cheesy but it's actually really
cute way to put it on so bright neon
pink yeah um but it looks like yeah okay
looks like this and I don't know if you
can see that but I like crosses over in
the front like that and then it has like
this little tight band right here i
really like dresses that have that type
and and then it's kind of loose on the
bottom I don't really like dresses that
are tight on the bottom anymore because
I still of those everything like the
ones where it's like a tight band and
that it's loose on the bottom this dress
looks like you wouldn't be that cute but
it's cute it looks like from the camera
it kind of looks like something you'd
buy from like wet seal or like justice
or something but um no it's actually
it's really cute and this is brand-new
because the tags are still on it oh and
I didn't see how much you cost well this
was like six dollars and then the other
two dresses were like twelve dollars
yeah please classes kind of expensive
for sure and then these shorts I think
we're like ten dollars or something okay
anyways um also I bought my mom a shirt
she wanted me to buy it for her I'm just
going to clued it in here
isn't probably gonna end up wearing it
and this shirt was ten bucks it's just
like a very loose shirt with stripes on
it it's kind of like a v-neck right
there I don't know it's cute 6k jeans or
something you know so there's that and
then um this dress it's like my favorite
dress in the whole world it's so pretty
when you put it on oh my god I'm so
excited show you guys like in a fashion
video sometime or something this dress
was eight dollars and it's originally
from Angie whatever that is or Angie or
something it looks like you'd be not
cute but oh my god it's so cute when you
put it on trust me it's cute okay so
it's like this and its really cute
because in the front it kind of like
house like a v-neck kind of I'd love the
pattern and then the sleeves are kind of
like quarter length that keeps on going
and then at the bottom it has like that
tight band that I was telling you guys
before about and then it's kind of loose
and it's so cute oh my gosh it probably
looks so weird on camera but it looks so
pretty on with some like gladiator
flip-flops and like some a bunch of like
bracelets and stuff like that and then
like wavy hair oh my gosh I just love
this dress I suspect I say how much it
costed I can't find the chair now it was
eight dollars i think i already said
back if ever then i also got this this
plaid kind of shirt just because i
always always always wanted like a plaid
shirt but i never got one and this one I
think oh yeah this is from straw it's
originally from charlotte russe and it's
just a blue like what's it called plaid
shirt like button up shirt and has like
quarter length sleeves that are already
buttoned up and stuff and this is really
cute like jean shorts or like some
ripped like skinny jeans or something I
don't know but love it and then the last
three things I have are jeans and I got
the
today they are so cute let me show you
guys them okay so the first one is from
big Vegas studio I don't even know these
are just plain jeans so it looks like
this and they're not really skinny
they're like that straight cut which I
absolutely love because it kind of like
fun jumbles up like on the bottom so
it's really cute with like flats or
something but they just look like that
they're kind of washed by the Navy and
then that head butt looks they're really
really cute though and they really
flattered like my like sheep I guess you
can say um then also i got these and
these are from it says 21 denim is
zephan forever 21 or is that something
else I feel like it's supposed to be
from frozen water but not sure but
they're just like I think they're
jugging so yeah I'm pretty sure and
they're like dark jeans and then they're
a little bit ripped and then I think
these are skinny jeans actually i'm not
sure but they're really cute and they're
really nice and tight so I like them and
these are from London gene and they're
just look like that and these are really
really skinny jeans like these are
really tight um really realize I yeah so
that's basically it oh and then also I
got some like black hot havaianas
flip-flops that are right there but I
don't like you're like doing them but
they weren't used okay they were brand
new because you can tell by the bottom
like the bottom stole the sticker on it
you can see that it wasn't worn down or
anything like that so don't worry don't
go home me saying oh my god you just
bought someone's used shoes because I
don't know in my opinion this kinda
gross but um know their new flip-flops
so it's all good no worries um that's
basically it for my collective haul

wasn't too long but that's basically it
for today's video and I hope you guys
