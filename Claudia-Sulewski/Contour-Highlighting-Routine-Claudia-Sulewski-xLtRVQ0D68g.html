that way did not just be your bat myself
hello everybody and welcome back today's
video is going to be my contouring a
slash highlighting routine I've been
really obsessed with keeping everything
on my face very simple as far as eye
makeup and lip colors so I've been
having a lot of fun playing around with
different highlighters and contouring
techniques yeah if you guys want to see
how I like to contour and highlight my
face then I keep on watching for
foundation I am using the Make Up For
Ever Ultra HD stick foundation in the
shade 123 and applying that all over and
then I'm going in with their camouflage
concealer palette in the shade number
one and just highlighting underneath my
eyes and covering any blemishes that I
have I didn't really have too many while
filming this so I skipped that step but
this is where I go in to cover up the
under-eye circles and then after that we
move on to contouring I swear this video
is not sponsored by makeup forever but
I'm just genuinely very obsessed with
their face products so this is their pro
sculpting palette in the shade 20 and
using it the darkest contour shade I'm
applying it to my cheekbones my jawline
you guys will see me bring it down to my
neck and I will usually target it with a
smaller brush and then go in with a
bigger one which you out well now it's
not in the frame but I use a smaller one
and then I blend it out with the bigger
brush I've been really obsessed with
cream contouring lately because I find
that the color just melts into your skin
and really blends with the foundation
underneath and also it tends to stay on
a lot longer once you lock it in place
with a face powder so I basically just
continue to work with the products
between the two different palettes and
going in with a contouring and
highlighting until I'm pleased with the
results this next step might be my
favorites but now we are moving on to
powder highlighter this is from Becca
and
the shade at moonstone and lately I have
been applying my highlighter onto like
cream products and then applying on the
powder and I think it just gives it a
more subtle highlight it's not too
overwhelming and also it lasts a lot
longer for me now it is time to set
everything I normally like to use the
Laura Mercier translucent powder but
today I wanted to show you guys two
different powders so I just use this
around my eyes and under-eye circles
because it really helps to brighten up
that area but the other product I've
been obsessed with is the Ultra HD
pressed powder it's really convenient
for traveling because powder isn't just
flying everywhere so as you can see it
takes away all of the shine oh so
quickly and yeah I'll just apply this
all over my face and as you can see the
contour and the highlight stay
completely put and you can still see
them through the powder so after setting
all of that I like to go in with one
final bronze I'm using my benefit hoola
bronzer and kind of roughly buffing out
and bronzing my face so I'll apply to my
eyelids if I'm not wearing any eyeshadow
that day and then I'm just applying it
back on my cheeks but not as precise as
I did the first time around and just
kind of blending all that down to give
myself some color and a little bit of
you know that sunkissed look and then
lastly we need to apply on some blush
I'm using peaches by Mac of course I'm
obsessed with this color I use it all
year round and I'm just patting that on
the high points of my cheeks on most
days I'll just throw in some mascara and
call it a day but that is what I like to
do to highlight and contour my face
so that is it for today's video I hope
you guys enjoyed it and if you try out
this tutorial or any of these products

my Twitter is at Claudius loose key as
well as my Instagram and all that stuff
