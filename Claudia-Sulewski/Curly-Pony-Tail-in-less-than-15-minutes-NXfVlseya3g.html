tutorial for you guys and it is this hot
ponytail with all of these curls if you
can see them I don't know if you can see
them they're all curly and stuff and so
you guys might think that this took a
long time but honestly at the most like
15 minutes and this is definitely a
school hair tutorial so you can do this
before school and I've actually done
this to school also um so that's why I
wanted to create it for you guys because
I know you can't really curl your hair
before school unless you wake up like
two hours earlier so yeah I'm gonna
teach you guys how to do this quick hair
tutorial that you can definitely do
before school I really like it because
it's kind of like it's not like just
curly hair that's down and it's not just
straight ponytail it's a curly ponytail
which I really like the look of because
it looks very fun and bouncy and fresh
and yes if you guys want to find out how
I created this cute little ponytail then
keep on watching okay so this is the
first step and obviously you guys can
tell that I just took a shower and
basically I just combed my hair with a
wide tooth comb make sure you do not
brush your hair with a regular brush or
a brush like this because you can damage
and break your hair because no it's not
as in wet and very bad so use combs if
you don't have a wide tooth comb release
using our one but anyways just the first
step is really do whatever you do to
your hair or a while that's why
and just like comb it out or whatever so
there's no notes no why just said that
no weird accent bands my hair is like
partially wet like it's just starting to
dry and it's actually that time right
now so I'm about to go to bed so this is
what I'm doing it right now and
basically what you're going to do is the
first thing that you want to do is
because this isn't everyday look like
basically saying that you can do this
before school I have to put my hair in a
bun so that it's at least a little bit
like a wavy so when the ponytail turns
out it's gonna be at least a little bit
wavy so I don't have to crawl every
piece otherwise I'd be spending an hour
doing my hair before school and I wanted
to do that okay because I don't have
that kind of time so that's why I do
like a bottom before I go to bed so I'm
not going to do my regular messy buns
I'm gonna do like a tight bun that will
last when I sleep and yeah let me back
up and we'll really get my hair curly so
just have a regular ponytail there's a
mirror here so it's like it's really
tight and I like is - I did was I took
it and I like like folded it like that
if you guys know I'm saying whatever I
don't know why don't you take a clip and
clip my back here yeah
um again I'm gonna go to bed so that's
all for the first step just make a tight
bun at the top of your head
let's go to sleep so I'll see you guys
tomorrow morning
alright everyone sorry for kind of the
weird setup I don't know it's just
because I have a man from me and I like
a random gland in front of me too but um
yeah this is the best I can get right
now to do my hair so anyways it's
morning now and I slept in my little bun
and it's a lot more looser now you know
since I slept in it um so yeah this is
gonna be the next step so go ahead and
take out any clips that you have okay so
now you see like all these crazy curls
and it's kind of like that messy curly
look which I really like so kind of
crazy so now I'm gonna do is just put my
hair into a very tight high ponytail you
can make it like perfectly in the middle
in the back I don't like doing that out
of putting it high kind of on an angle
um but just however you like wearing
your pom tails you can do it over but I
like having it right here and kind of
off to the side and I'm going to choose
the left side this time because last
time I did this I chose the right side
make sure it's really really tight look
back and I'm going to go ahead and add a
clip randomly in here
if you have any baby like flyways or any
like carrots that welcome to ponytail
just take some I don't know some right
to move so I'm just using this
volumizing bone styler I mean it works
whatever and you can just place it on
your hair and let all the little baby
hairs stick back on your head
I'm gonna take some this will just like
perfect my ponytail a lot more don't
forget the side where the other ponytail
is and then if you have any extra in
your hand you can just go ahead and
scrunch your hair I mean what is there's
more volume to it okay so now it's time
for the curling iron I already got one
heated up and this is like an ancients
con air curler I think this thing is
like so old it doesn't even have and you
like measuring adjustments or doesn't
even tell me when it's ready I'm just
kind of have to feel it if it's hot and
it's not really hot so yeah some con air
I don't know this is is this like a half
inch or a one-inch I don't know I think
it's half inch so if you guys know
comment below but it's really skinny and
small which is what I really like
because I just like how the curls turn
out in my hair so now this is the part
where you kind of get creative you can
choose whatever type of curls you want
so what you can do is you can wrap your
hair around it like the way Taylor stood
girls are here or you can actually use
the little clamp and like make like that
so I'm just gonna do random ones I'm
gonna do both styles so basically what
you do is you know you're going to be
doing this style before school so you
kinda have to work fast but I mean
you're not gonna have to curl every
single piece of hair you're just gonna
curl random pieces
okay so i start out by curling like this
so i'm going to go ahead and wait okay
so i'm gonna go ahead and let go and
we've got that curl and i can barely see
it because it's all messy go ahead and
do this he's here I'm gonna wrap it
let it drop see this one little crap yes
so now just can go ahead and curl a
bunch of random pieces in my hair and
I'll get back to you guys
all right so I completed my little
curling process with my ancient curler
and I don't know you guys can see that I
have like random little curls everywhere
and I think it looks absolutely adorable
I love this like oh my gosh and I just
love the way that my ponytail is like
super highs up okay so the next step is
just make sure to keep your curls in so
if you want these curls class all day
you gotta put some kind of hairspray on
them and I'm using the Pantene medium
thick hair style hair spray looks like
next I'm going to go ahead and shake it
up and just drench this ponytail
Thursday you can also get like the top
of your head to back
okay
all right after a while as ran but yeah
now it's going to last all day and it's
super cute and bouncy and curly and
that's it for today's tutorial hope you
guys like this every day not every day
but like school hairstyle look because I
think it definitely looks like you did
something to your hair but it actually
takes at the most like 15 minutes to
clear on scat that's it for today's
video I'll see you guys for another one
