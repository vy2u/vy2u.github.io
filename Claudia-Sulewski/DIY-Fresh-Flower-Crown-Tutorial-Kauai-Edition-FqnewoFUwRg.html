special one as I had so much fun filming
this with my friends and when traffic in
quite it's so cute a few weeks ago I
posted the first part with today you'll
be seeing the second and last edition to
it let's through time travel back into
Hawaii on day two of my quiet venture I
met with my friend and local guide
Chelsea fly for a little hangout on the
beach honestly there's nothing better
than a morning in Hawaii as we were
talking about what we should do with our
day I had an inspiration being
surrounded by such tropical flowers like
larrya passion flower hibiscus we
decided to visit the local botanical
garden and meet up with these flower con
artists innovations are grounds after
some exploring and flower picking
Chelsea and I are this beautiful
Botanical Garden with Alanna who's a
flower crown lay expert artist and
you're going to teach us how to make
flower crowns we have this collection of
beautiful tropical flowers from the
island I noticed that you brought us a
show yeah I used to guide for these all
the time did you find never found a
sunrise and they're only found aren't
they only found in anyway I prepped you
guys some bases you know thank you
so we have this twine wrap floral wire
and we have ribbon tied to the end so
that way it's adjustable
and then kind of floral tape so I like
to use floral tape because it's tacky so
we're going to make like an arm's length
yeah so we're going to start from one
end of our wire and we're going to lay
flowers down until we get to the other
end wrap just a couple of times so this
is where we start we're going to choose
some leaves or whatever you want to
start with I usually like to start with
a couple little firms is there like a
direction that we should be laying yes
so when we're starting you do the stem
side facing towards you and then the
tops of the leaves of the flowers facing
away from you and I usually like to wrap
it two times at least what flower are
you starting on I'm starting off with
the Cimmerian this is it smells overview
when they're designing your flower crown
you want to think about if you have a
couple main flowers like we have the
hibiscus plumeria and then we have other
things that go in between so you want to
thank okay where do I want my hibiscus
maybe more like over the ear yeah just
really relaxing it's like meditating
yeah and you're basically just making
little arrangements as you go along the
wire we go further end so when you're
prepping your flower I like to recommend
doing an inch to two inches at least for
the stem that when you're wrapping your
flower tape around it it has something
to grab oh my gosh I think it's so
creative listen so I'm gonna yeah
thinking of putting on this type of you
I love it yeah and I'm not that yellow
so in Hawaii we call these lake polo
which means head laying there's
different styles of misting headlands in
way we make flower crowns all year and
it's been a part of Hawaiian culture I
mean forever for thousands of years you
know a good time to give people flower
crowns are on the birthday graduations
you know to celebrate anything actually
that's so good yeah you guys are doing
great
I'm having so much fun thank you for all
you're doing we're picking it I love
Union arts-and-crafts Hawaii edition
