about making this video also today it's
going to be kind of like a Christmas
holiday gift idea video it's not really
talking about what type of gifts you can
get a girl or a guy but I'm just gonna
be talking or showing you guys how do
you make something really really unique
and homemade that you can give out for
the holidays and that is how to make
your own soaps so basically today I'm
going to be showing you guys how to make
little homemade soaps so I've got this
little yellow circle flower one this was
like vanilla and I've got this light
blue one that says handmade and it's
like a square this feels like cucumber
love cucumber melon yeah so I'm going to
teach you guys how to make these cute
little soaps for the holidays so keep on
watching if you guys want to find out
how to make these so these soaps are a
really cute idea to give out to your
friends and family and like little
stocking presents or whatever
so today I'm going to show you guys how
to make them and I actually recorded
myself making them so I think that's
really fun but I'm also going to show
you right now the things that you need
so the first thing that you actually
need is the clear glycerin soap or
whatever it's called I have two times
it's just saying that you can get
everything at any local craft store like
Michaels and you just kind of local
craft store I mean you can find so many
things on home making soap things you
know from the cents to the colors to the
molds to the actual soaps all that junk
you can just get a crowd source if you
guys are wondering so I have two types
of soaps so I've got this left of the
pot party clear growth glycerin soap and
it looks like this and I have you so
much of this like in sixth grade I used
to make a bunch of these and then like
the next school and I've only got this
much left of the clear stuff so if you
want to make any clear translucent soap
like this that's how it's going to turn
out this stuff is unscented and of
course it's bubbly it's the excess so
it's like the key ingredient so then
also I have this Shia Shai butter soap
and it looks like this
and this is actually the white one and
you guys can see how much I've used to
this stuff like I love making soaps and
I actually prefer this a lot more this
one makes the soap all opaque and also
this one is really nice because this one
actually has like a moisturizer so
you're actually moisturizing your hands
when you're using the soap that you fade
it so I have some first off you need
these kind of glycerin soap in the box
so next you need little molds and this
is like where it becomes really fun to
obviously make the soaps so I've got
this very basic simple square one that's
one that says natural handmade which is
the one that I use today whoops then I
also have this one which is really cute
and elegant it just it just has some
pretty flower detailing and then this is
my favorite it has like a leaf like a
square of Daisy a circle one that I used
today I this one this one's just like
favorite and step so you need the soap
the molds and also you need the cents
and you can get these impactors for
packages of 1/2 it all depends um but
basically they look like this and I
don't have the packaging but they say
like soap cents
I don't know it says something it's all
like in the soap section you know so
I've got apple vanilla light rose I
think it's yeah and cucumber melon so I
have those and they're like little
droppers and then of course to make your
soap fun you need some kind of colors so
I've got turquoise blue
orange yellow purple pink green I'm just
a bunch of colors and these come in
different variety of packages and things
like that so those are always really
really fun and the that's like the main
things that you need and the last things
that you need that you can find around
the house are second are a top that
smoke microwavable or like a little bowl
like I'm using this little bowl thing I
don't know it's called you need a knife
to actually cut the glycerin you know
just a standard knife I don't know if
you need help with cutting I just
recommend you know pet being your
parents to help you if you guys are
still really young and you can't handle
knives or they're like scary for you I
don't know just any basic cutting knife
and it also needs something to mix the
soap with while it's melted and I just
have this little shish kebab stick so
yeah all right now I'm going to teach
you guys how to create these little
soaps and the steps so keep on watching
start out by choosing the mold that you
are going to use and the type of soap
that you're going to use and I'm going
to be using the clear one for this soap
and basically what you want to do is
just using your knife if you need any
help with parents and go ahead but
you're basically just going to cut the
soap into little pieces and try to fit
them in the mold that you want to use
and this is just kind of estimating
about how much soap that you're going to
have to melt so I think I did a pretty
good job filling up my little molds with
the unmelted soap so now I'm going to
dump that into my little microwavable
cup and I'm going to melt it in a
microwave for about 15-20 - 10 seconds
it really depends on how much soap you
are actually melting but you'll note
that it is completely boiled and hot
once it starts bubbling up so you want
to make sure you watch it while it's in
the microwave but before you melt
anything you want to set everything up
because it dries up really fast so you
need some kinds of scent for the soap
because obviously soap has scents and
I'm using vanilla for this one and also
you need some kind of color and I'm
going to be using a yellow so just have
everything out
and go ahead and microwave it so now
that mine's already melted I am starting
to dip all my colors and scents into the
soap and you want to do this really fast
and you could put as much color or as
much scent as you want of course it all
depends on how much you're using but I'm
going to go ahead and pour it into my
mold
so now it's time for the next soap so
I'm going to be using the other glycerin
soap which is the opaque one mmm and I'm
going to be using that mold once again
just cut your soap into a bunch of
pieces and try to fit them evenly into
the mold and of course it does not have
to be perfect so just kind of try your
best on how much soap you want to put
into your little molds so yeah I think I
had enough so that's as best as I can
get it so yeah now you're gonna dump all
that into your little cup or
microwavable bowl and make sure you
prepare all of your stuff so I'm going
to be using a blue dye and a cucumber
melon scent so make sure to leave those
out before you are melting your soap and
also make sure you have your little
shish kebab stick to clean your soap so
I went ahead and microwaves it for a
couple seconds and so now you guys can
watch me mix in the scent and also the
dye so I'm just mixing that in there
make sure you do this very quickly and
also a really cool thing you can do is
make a tie-dye soap so you can mix it
only just a little bit so it kind of
looks swirly and then just pour it
straight into the molds and it has like
that swirly effect but I just mixed it
all the way so now go ahead and just
pour it into your mold and let it dry
for about you know 40 - 20 seconds make
sure you scrape everything out and yeah
that's about it for that soap alright so
now that you have you guys saw me make
two soaps so once you've waited about 20
to 40 minutes it all depends on you know
how big yourself is it's gonna be in
here has to be room temperature and make
sure it's on like a level surface you
don't want it to like dry crooked um so
look like this and you just have to pop
it out I already pop this one out so it
falls really easily but it's kind of
hard to pop out like the first time I
tried popping it out I seriously thought
that it was like stuck in there but you
really have to like push your thumbs and
eventually it comes out to these super
adorable adorable adorable little soaps
and I love them you can package them
give them to friends and family and
stuff like that there's also a lot of
cool things that you can put in your
soaps like for example for like
exfoliators you can put like little like
oatmeal like oatmeal what's it called
just like like regular oatmeal grain
things in your soap to like exfoliate
and stuff like that or you can put like
one time I made like a purple soap and I
put like lavender like flowers inside
the soap it looks really really gorgeous
so you can really get creative with that
also I got this thing which was
specially made for soaps and it's like a
gold glitter and basically it just goes
in your soap and it's like the prettiest
thing ever like I seriously wish I can
use this as an eyeshadow it's so
beautiful and yeah you put that in
yourself while it's my thing and stuff
like that so umm definitely love this
idea I think you guys should totally
like go to Michael's and try to sell
yourselves it's really fun to do like
with your siblings and stuff like that
like I've done it I think with my mom um
and I've made some for my parents and my
dad and things like that I don't know
but yeah it's super super fun to make
over the holiday it's definitely like
the thought that counts with these
because you know it's like that you made
these soaps by yourself this you know a
really really cute idea and if you guys
are wondering the scope things is
actually my mom's I mean like I steal
her clothes all the time and I know you
guys are gonna ask me where I got this
from so well that I'm gonna take it off
I actually have a hard time debating on
what I want to wear for some of us all
these really cute like coats and jackets
and I chose this one but it's by 11
this I don't know but the tag looks like
that so you guys are wondering and it's
like the cutest thing ever and I love
this um so yeah okay also another thing
