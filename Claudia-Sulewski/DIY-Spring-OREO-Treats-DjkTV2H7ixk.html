channel oh my god it has been so long
and i apologize i don't think i've
uploaded a video in like two weeks which
is just two weeks in case of you guys
don't follow me on instagram or twitter
then you wouldn't know that i actually
went on a cruise for a week with megan
ranks here on youtube don't worry our
films a bunch of videos and vlogs and
stuff so those will be coming so that
kind of explains my sudden disappearance
but don't worry guys I'm back the videos
are coming i did not die today i wanted
to do an Easter inspired video so I'm
going to be showing you guys to really
easy DIY snacks that are super easy and
fast to recreate and of course they both
contain Oreos one of my favorite cookies
in the entire world I hope you guys
enjoy it today's video and let's get
into today's video I'm miss filming I
love you guys okay let's go by for the
first recipe you're going to need some
Oreos chocolate pudding any type of
orange frosting a clear plastic bag and
clear cups so we're going to start off
by separating the Oreo cookies from
there filling
once you are done with the first step
you're going to throw your cookies into
your plastic bag because we are going to
start mashing them up and I don't
recommend using your hand I definitely
recommend using something else like a
spoon I figured that out later on but
we're just going to mash them up because
the Orioles are going to represent the
dirt in our cups so once you don't that
just put it aside because we are going
to make our orange frosting so what I
did was I just bought some white
frosting and orange food coloring and
just mix it up but by them there you go
you
once I finished mixing it all up I
bought one of those fancy piping sets
where you get the tips and everything
and I'm just going to start by placing
my icing into one of the bags
you
once you've got that ready to go we're
going to place that aside and grab our
cups pudding and mashed up Oreos so for
the dirt I decided I want to create like
a layered effect so I start off by
applying not applying putting some of
the pudding into the cups then after
that I'm going in with a layer of the
Oreo then once again be pudding I love
pudding
and lastly we're going to dump some more
Oreo crumbs on the top
all right now it's time to create our
fake carrot tops so all I'm doing is
grabbing the orange icing and piping on
three medium size circle the dome things
and in the cup I did three you can do
more if you want
to create these stems for the carrot saw
did was grab a strawberry and use its
leaves to put on top of the icing
obviously you don't have to eat this you
can take them out before you eat it but
I think it gives a nice little touch and
it really makes the icing look like
little carrots
now it is time to create our little
chicken Oreo thingamabob errs so for
this recipe you're going to need some
Oreos of course white chocolate that
same orange icing yellow food coloring
any type of chocolate for the eyes and
pretzel sticks so first off we are going
to grab the white chocolate and crack it
into a bowl because we're going to have
to melt it in the microwave
once that is all melted add in your
yellow food coloring and mix it up
now I'm dipping my Oreos into the melted
chocolate completely covering them and
placing them onto wax paper so that they
can easily come off once they cool down
now would be a great time to give our
little chickens summer legs so what I'm
doing is cracking off little pieces of
the pretzels and sticking them in at the
bottom of the Oreo now that the
chocolate has hardened I'm going in with
the orange icing and creaks and now I'm
going in with the chocolate pudding and
creating</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
