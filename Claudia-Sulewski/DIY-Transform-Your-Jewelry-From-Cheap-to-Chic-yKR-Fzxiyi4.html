for you guys and I will admit that this
is probably the most easiest and
simplest DIY video that has ever been
created but I personally really really
love how my jewelry pieces turned out
and I mean it came in really good use
for me so hopefully this video will help
out some of you guys as well as far as
the title goes I'm in no way trying to
say that colorful jewelry looks cheap
and silver jewelry looks chic but I
really couldn't think of another title
and this one just sounded cute and
catchy so that's why I used it before I
show you guys how to transform your
jewelry pieces I quickly want to show
them to you guys in full detail because
I really really do love how they turned
out and I think they will match so much
more to my clothes now because before
they were just so bright and colorful
that I really couldn't wear them with
anything I may have purposely bought
some of these especially for this video
but that's okay because I love them now
so by far my favorite piece is this
necklace right here and everything is
from forever 21 because their jewelry is
just so inexpensive so I love messing
with them and making them my own so I
love how this one turned out I think it
looks so great with this shirt I'm also
wearing the ring that I personalized and
I think it looks so cool with the
diamonds on the edges and the middle
kind of looks like a metal stone so it
kind of gives it that edgy vibe lastly I
transformed these earrings and I love
how they look now before they were just
way too colorful for me so I think this
turned out really great on the earrings
if you guys want to find out how I
transformed my jewellery from cheap to
chic then keep on watching
you're first going to need some silver
shiny tape and I believe this is called
foil tape correct me if I'm wrong but
you're also going to need scissors and
some sort of sharp object like a safety
pin a needle or a little tack to help
rip the tape and you'll see why we need
that so first what we're going to do is
cut some of the tape off and kind of
roughly measure up how much we're going
to need for our jewelry piece then
you're going to peel off the tape and
stick it right on to the surface that
you want to cover using your thumb you
just want to start smoothing out the
tape over your jewelry and I like to
start from the middle and go outwards
since mine had a bunch of edges it was
kind of hard to get all the little
cracks out but I think it looks kind of
cool actually so once you're done with
that you just want to take your nail and
kind of start pressing into the edges
where you're going to rip off the tape
once you've done that take your sharp
object and start to cut the tape along
the edge that you want to rip it off and
trust me this will make your life so
much easier because once you're done
with this you could just rip it right
off
make sure to take your time and be
patient with it so now I'm just ripping
off the side
so beautiful so now we're going to take
a topcoat and apply this all over the
tape just to secure it and make it look
more shiny and prevent it from getting
scratched or ripped so I'm just doing
that all over and once you're done with
that you just want to make sure you let
the ring completely dry so I hope you
guys enjoyed today's video and as you
saw this DIY was very very easy but I
think it just looks so cool and a lot of
you guys might be thinking well Claudia
why don't you just put nail polish on
your jewelry like silver nail polish
that is so much easier and faster but I
feel like there's just so many videos
out there show you guys how to put nail
polish on your jewelry so I really
wanted to kind of step out of the box
and try something different and I also
think that this method using the tape
turns out a lot more different looking
because it kind of looks like metal tell
me if you guys agree with me but it kind
of looks like it's metal so I thought it
looked a little bit more edgy and unique
and stuff and you can't really recreate
this effect with Meowth polish so that's
why I thought that this video would come
in handy for you guys so once again I
hope you guys enjoyed it and that is it
for today's video bye lights camera
action today I have a DIY video where
drilling what oh man in my last video
like half my hair was behind my shoulder
so it looked like this you guys are like
Claudia your haircut is so uneven don't
worry guys it is even there you go there
is oh my god that keeps showing
this chair is so squeaky and it bothers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
