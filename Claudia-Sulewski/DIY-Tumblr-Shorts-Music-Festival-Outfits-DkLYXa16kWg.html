DIY tutorial and a mini lookbook
combined into one and this is actually
my first ever like musical festival
themed video that I've ever created on
my channel which is really exciting
so in today's video I'm going to be
taking it simple light blue shorts like
these and show you guys how you can
customize them and to make them your own
so the shorts that I'll be using in
today's video are from Levi's I love
this color of denim because it's perfect
for the springtime they're super light
and bright and it would be really fun to
kind of mess around with and make them
my own before we get started I quickly
wanted to thank device for sending me
these shorts and letting me mess around
with them clearly I haven't done it yet
so fingers crossed they turn out cute
let's get into the DIY and find out what
I do with these I'm excited so let's
begin with these supplies I'm using my
Levi's 501 denim shorts in the shade
slash if you're wanting to distress your
jeans
I recommend other sandpaper scissors or
tweezers different materials and fabrics
are super fun to cut out and place on
your shorts so my two examples are lace
and black denim you can also attach on
different studs beads whatever you're
into I had a few studs and lastly of
course you need some sort of adhesive I
used glue for today's video
I'm starting off by tearing up the edges
of my shorts to give them a more
distressed look and I'm just doing that
by pulling out strands with my tweezers
you can also create the classic ripped
effect too by cutting two horizontal
lines and pulling out the vertical
strands with your tweezers leaving only
behind the white horizontal strings I
decided to create this effect a few
times on the front of my shorts after
that I just cleaned it off with a lint
roller now it's time for the fun part so
I'm grabbing it the black denim that I
just bought at a craft store and I'm
eyeballing the shape that I need to cut
out to cover the top front pocket my
method may not be most efficient but I
basically just laid the material on the
desired location and was cutting as I
was going once you cut out your shape it
is time to either glue or sew it on I'm
a little bit lazy so I just use it glue
but it stayed on very well and it was
super quick so I just applied to the
jeans and pressed it on after that I did
the same exact thing on the other side
except I avoided the little penny pocket
or whatever its purposes I don't know
once you're done gluing always be sure
to cut these sides off or any strands
that are hanging out to make it look all
clean and party looking now for the back
I'm doing the same exact process except
I'm doing it on the butt pockets and I
decided that I didn't want to cover the
entire pocket but rather just that
bottom half area so it was a little more
difficult to get the exact shape down
but it turned out really cute in the end
and for the other side I placed my
cutout on to some more material and used
it as a guideline to save myself lots of
time and lots of patience and lots of
effort and once you're done with that
just grab your glue or sewing supplies
and put it on
with the last of my black material I
covered the top panels on the back and
glucose on now for the studs I like to
keep things pretty simple so I just
applied on some little square studs on
the back Levi's tag of my jeans I think
it gives a cute little personal touch
without being too wha-bam in your face
so that's all I did to the back and then
to the front
I placed four more of the same square
studs onto the tops and bottoms of the
little belt loops if you're using glue
like I did then be sure to let your
jeans either dry overnight or a few
hours and you are done so let's get into
how I would style my new customized
shorts
to start off my outfit I wore a simple
white shirt and knotted it to show off
the studs on my shorts I threw on this
floral jacket to balance out the plain
white t-shirt and I just wore some
simple black heeled boots
for my second outfit I wore a black
leotard to really show off the shorts
and I kept everything black as far as
accessories and jewelry go to keep up
with the theme
if you're interested in finding out
where a certain item is from I will have
all of the details about my outfits in
the description box so that is it for
today's DIY / mini lookbook video I hope
