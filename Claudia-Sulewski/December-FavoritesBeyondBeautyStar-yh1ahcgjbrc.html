going to do this video because it's
already pretty late in the month of
January but I have so many exciting
things to share with you guys so I
decided to film this video anyways
today's products are very very random I
think I have about three makeup related
products sorry and can we please
appreciate the fact that the background
music playing right now is titled
relaxing elevator music just picture it
do you sometimes the ukulele music gets
little old we gotta spice it up here on
beyondbeautystar so I'm gonna stop
rambling let's do this my first favorite
for the month of December was my benefit
Porefessional Agent Zero shine which is
one of their newest products and it's
really cool and different so that's why
I was very fascinated with it as you can
see here at the bottom unscrews to a
little brush and then the top comes off
like this with a little sifter if you
pour the product in the cap and then
just use the brush that it comes with
and what you do with this is you just
spot it on any places on your face that
tend to get very oily so for me it would
be my t-zone and a little bit on my chin
maybe and this product really really
works it definitely absorbs all the oils
on your face and keeps them off
throughout the day and I really haven't
tried out this product to its fullest
potential just because my skin tends to
get very dry during the wintertime but
it still gets a little bit oily so this
will be really great once of extra
starts getting hotter outside so for the
spring and summertime but overall I
really like the whole concept of this
idea it is like the next blotting paper
revolution I love it it's really good
next up I have to make up brush
favorites the first one is the Sigma
tapered face f25 and I've owned a tulip
brush before but it just got really old
and used up so it's basically circular
now so I almost forgot what it feels
like to use one of these brushes so when
I recently got this in one of the newer
collections I know this brush comes in a
collection so i'll be sure to link that
in the downbar but i forgot how much i
love these kind of brushes that are
shaped like this
I personally use this for face powder
because i really like i'll just swipes
on my face i don't know it's really soft
but you can definitely use this for
blush highlight bronzer pretty much
anything with the way that it's shaped
so it's kind of like an all-purpose
makeup brush so i always use one of
these when i'm switching up the use for
face powder bronzer etc and the second
brush that I've been really liking is
also from Sigma surprise this is the
soft a blender concealer f64 brush and I
like this because it has a similar shape
to the first one that I showed you guys
but this one is meant for liquid
products so this is really great for
using with concealer and i really like
it underneath the eyes around the nose
and any other spots that I want to
conceal on my face so this brush has
been really fun to use I apologize if I
don't have enough energy in this video
or if i seemed tired but i just got over
the stomach flu and this morning i woke
up really sick feeling and just gross
feeling so i apologize about that
anyways my next favorites would have to
be the new clean and clear and nights
relaxing all-in-one cleansing wipes and
I've always loved their original
cleansing wipes I'll use them all the
time they're really great was taking off
makeup but they recently came out with
this new night relaxing collection and
they have a cleanser and these makeup
wipes and I really really like these
I've been using them pretty much every
single night if not a night ever since I
got them they contain sea minerals and
seek help extract and I really like the
smell of these as well it's just a very
calming very fresh but subtle scent to
them so it's really nice to use before
bedtime as the packaging is just so
pretty of course totally dreamy in so
I've been really really liking these
makeup wipes they've definitely been my
favorite so far that actually sums up
all of my makeup related favorites
wasn't kidding when I said I didn't have
much but my next favorite is the bath
and bodyworks sleep lavender vanilla
pillow mist and basically what you do
with this is you can spray your pillows
or blankets or whatever before you go to
bed time and it's supposed to help you
kind of relax and fall asleep faster
and I have been obsessed with available
I have been obsessed with this I use it
every single night now before I go to
bed and I don't like to spread my pillow
just because I don't want it to break
out my face I haven't really noticed any
sign of breakouts but that's because I
usually avoid spraying my pillows I
normally just spray like the blankets
that are on top and kind of just around
my pillows because I have throw pillows
and stuff but I really liked the
lavender vanilla scent it smells really
good so I definitely recommend you guys
trying some sort of sleeping spray
because it just changes the way that you
look at sleeping I promise you my next
favorite would have to be these black
heeled boots from H&amp;amp;M and i got these a
while back but i'm pretty sure you guys
can still pick these up if you're
interested i just saw them at hmmm like
last weekend and the reason why i love
these shoes is because they are so so
comfortable they're all rubber on the
bottom so they do not make that clicking
noise when you walk and they just have a
really good grip and they're just super
comfortable inside and out I'm just
obsessed these and I wear them pretty
much every single day and I also like
how simple they are i'm sorry that
they're little dirty but as you can see
on these sides they have these little
parts right here that has this stretchy
materials so it's super easy to slip
these on and off real quick and I just
have only good things to say about these
shoes and they obviously go of
everything because they're just all
black oops my next favorite is a little
bit random but it's from urban
outfitters and it is this white little
tree root looking thing I don't know
what it's actually called but what you
do with it is you take the little cap
off and you can plug this into whatever
device you like to listen music off of
or watch movies or whatever so your
iPhone computer ipod ipad whatever you
want and what it does is it gives you
the option to share your music with
three other headphones so this is really
great if you want to listen to music
together with your friends or watch a
movie on one computer so this came in a
lot of use when I visited Aspen hot
brilliance here on YouTube a few weeks
ago because we would be sitting next to
each other editing videos and if we ever
wanted to share like a moment or I don't
know whatever if we want to show each
other music and stuff we just plucked
our headphones into here and we would
take it out and just switch this thing
in between computers so it's just really
convenient and I love it you can hang it
on a keychain and since this thing comes
to no use when you're alone it inspires
me to hang out with more people and
actually see my friends now speaking of
Aspen I quickly want to share with you
all my favorites video that is on
YouTube right now and if you guys are
subscribed to hot brilliance then I'm
sure you've already seen it but if not i
will link it down below and it is
Aspen's boyfriend tag i definitely
recommend you guys watching it and
checking it out especially if you enjoy
funny videos with really hot boyfriend's
in it so i will leave that link down
below it is just a fabulous video it's
perfection and it will be down there
next up I've got a few food-related
favorites because I love eating so my
first favorite would have to be these
organic sliced mangos and these are just
dried mangoes I've tried freeze dried
mangos before and I used to like them
but the taste just got really old really
fast and I also don't really like the
consistency of freeze dried fruit it's
just very chalky and dry to me but I
have been loving dried mangos they're
just very like chewy and you have to
like rip them to eat them so they're
really fun to eat I don't know I just
really love these I always grab them if
I'm sort of hungry and just want a snack
and they are super sweet so the only
ingredient in here are organic mangoes
so they're obviously super healthy for
you and they're just delicious so you
guys have never tried driving goes
before you need to go do that my next
favorite would have to be the young
earth organics vitamin c drops in citrus
grove that was a mouthful so they look
like this they're just little hard
candies that you can suck on and what's
cool about these is they contain a
vitamin C which you should be taking
every single day and five of these is
equivalent to two hundred percent of
your daily intake for vitamin C so
that's really great they also have no
fat in them or sodium or cholesterol and
they're free of a bunch of different
allergies like nut free soy free wheat
free dairy free I don't have to worry
about that but i just want to mention
that they're also organic vegan no
artificial dyes natural flavors I mean a
hundred percent natural flavors real
fruit like whatever I mean I can keep on
going it's like a list so I just really
really enjoy these I love the flavors on
them especially the lemon one I love
like lemon flavored candies and stuff
and they're super good so I love sucking
on these whenever I just want something
sweeter but I won't feel guilty about it
plus I'll begin in my vitamin C on which
is great so really like these i get both
of these from whole foods if you guys
are wondering my next your favorites I
do not have with me they're downstairs
in the kitchen but they are two
different cooking ish supplies so of
course you guys all saw this coming if
you watch my second channel but one of
my biggest favorites of December one of
course have to be my juicer and i think
i got it from the magic bullet company i
think it's called the magic juicer I
don't really know but I'll have it
somewhere written on the screen but I am
obsessed with juicing and I don't do it
because I want to be so LA or I don't
even know I guess it's like kind of a
thing to juice right now I feel like a
lot of people are doing it but I have
just been in love with you saying
because it makes you feel so good inside
like you really cannot explain how juice
makes you feel until you drink it and
it's all you talk about like I always
recommend it to friends and stuff and
people send me photos of them like
trying deuces and stuff even you guys as
well I get tweets all the time and it
makes me so excited press juice just
gives you so much energy and makes you
feel so alive in a wake I'm like getting
energized and excited just from talking
about it because I want to like go make
some right now but I really really
definitely recommend you guys to try out
juicing or at least buy some pressed
juice from any grocery
stores around you because it makes you
feel so good and I just can't explain it
but yeah that would definitely have to
be one of my favorites for the month of
December the next one which is also
downstairs but I'll have a little video
clip of it running right now actually
and I don't know what it's called I got
it from amazon for super cheap I think
it's like a vegetable spiral cutter or
something I personally just use it for
zucchini what you do is you stick the
fruit in and you just twist it and it
cuts the zucchini into spirals so this
makes a great substitute for pasta or
spaghetti's any of those karbi things so
I have been obsessed with spaghetti
zucchini lately you can pour on tomato
sauce with it or you can definitely make
some sort of stir fry with it which is
what I love doing really any type of
stir fry style sauce and then just throw
it on a pan and saute it and that also
tastes really good so I've been having
so much fun trying out different recipes
and stuff with these zucchini styled
noodles here comes the Claudia the
cleaner with another favorite my next
favorite would have to be this mop thing
whatever you want to call it and I
wanted to talk about this real quick
because it is such a great invention and
for me having hardwood floors in my
house for some reason we just get so
much dirt like under our bed on the
floors everywhere and I used to always
just vacuum which is the biggest pain in
the entire world I hate vacuuming it but
i recently got this from target and what
it is it's like a mop thing that has
this little trigger by the handle and
what that trigger does is it shoots
water out of the front right here which
stores in here so you can definitely put
in some soap or whenever you want to use
any type of cleaner inside here I just
use water because it's easy to fill up
in my sink and it's just so cool because
you spray it and then you can use this
double-sided mop I don't want to show
you guys the other side because it's
really dirty but here's the nice and
pretty clean side for the video um but
you can just use both sides and flip it
so use one side wet the other to dry off
and it's great because it just picks up
any like hair
you have on the ground or dust or
whatever and it's just a very easy
alternative to vacuuming or taking a mop
and whatever who does that these days
get one of these so this has definitely
kind of Wow okay i'm gonna put this down
but that has definitely saved so much
time and you know back pains and no
kidding but it takes a lot of time using
that so this favorites video is just all
over the place I feel like I should have
mentioned this while I was talking about
my shoes because it's another clothing
related article but cares whatever and
they would have to be beanies I was
never really a hat person I don't know
why I just always felt like I looked
kind of odd in them because my hair is
just really flat and I don't know but I
have been really obsessed with two hats
in particular of course I can't find my
favorite one at the moment but its this
black just really fuzzy beanie that I
got from forever 21 I wore it in one of
my vlogmas videos and a lot of you guys
were asking me where I got that hat so I
got it from forever 21 but I also got
this one from forever 21 as well and I
like this one because it's bright red so
this was really nice to wear around the
Christmas time because it's so jolly and
festive and yeah I feel like I still
look kind of weird wearing hats but
figuring it is like negative 15 degrees
outside in Chicago I kind of need to
wear hats nowadays yeah yesterday there
was like a negative 40 degree wind chill
or something crazy like that so this is
kind of like a Nessus this is kind of
like a necessity for me at the moment so
I've been really liking hats recently
and I spent at least I wanted to mention
my favorite channel of the moment and
I'm totally going to self-promote myself
right now but ever since I've been doing
a vlog mess on my second channel which
is where you vlog every single day until
christmas I just really gotten into
uploading on my second channel and you
guys are giving me such incredible
feedback on my vlogs which make me so
happy and I really think it's a great
way for you guys to kind of meet the
rest of my family
numbers and kind of how my life is and
my personality and stuff because you
know you guys don't really get to see my
personality and you know all of that
through look books &amp;amp; tutorials and
voiceovers and stuff so it's definitely
a really great way to interact with you
guys and stuff so any of you guys are
wondering i will still be vlogging a ton
in 2014 because i just loved doing
vlogmas so much so i'll be sure to link
my second channel at the end of this
video as well as in the description box
if you guys want to check it out i
already uploaded two logs from this year
so i love logging it's really fun that
sounded really fake but i promise i
really love logging for you guys it's
really fun so that is it for today's
video I apologize for looking like a
hobo with this whole whatever I don't
even know my hair hair just looks messy
everything I'm sorry I just have you
know still getting over that stomach flu
actually I am but I'm gonna stop talking
now and just end up to this video but I
hope you guys enjoyed it and I will see
you guys for a new video very soon Wow
