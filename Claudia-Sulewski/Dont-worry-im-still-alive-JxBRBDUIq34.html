haven't made a video it's so long it has
obviously been like weeks and I'm so
sorry for that I don't even know why
like I don't even I don't even know why
I've been making videos lately it's not
like I have like really good excuse or
anything like during the weekends I feel
like lately I've been just like hanging
out with a lot of people during the
weekends when weekend's have been kind
of crazy and then during the weekdays I
guess I'm just like too lazy to film but
it was just so bad I don't know but I'm
so sorry I'm like the worst youtuber in
the entire world I miss you guys so much
and lately I just it's not just the fact
I haven't been making videos maybe I
also haven't been like checking my
emails lately or checking like my
Twitter and Facebook Fanpage and all
that stuff and I I don't even know why I
think part of the reason is because my
computer is like slowly dying like
comment below and tell me if this is
happening to your computer if you have
like a MacBook or any type of like Apple
computer and - like 2 years old now and
is your computer like slowly dying
because mine is like every single time I
turn it on after like 2 minutes the
whole thing freezes and I have to like
shut it down and then you know turn it
back on and then it keeps freezing and I
keep having to restart it and like all
this stuff and I don't even know why so
because of that because I can my
computer is like basically broken I
don't really like go on it is soft in
and I guess that's kind of the reason
why I haven't been really like on
Twitter and all that kind of stuff
because it's just so annoying going on
the computer cuz I get so mad at it
because it's like it doesn't work I
don't know so then also editing videos
is really annoying because every single
two minutes it freezes shut it down turn
it back on continue editing free
back down it is so so annoying so come
well this happens to your like Apple
computer as well because it is still
annoying and I honestly want to get a
new like computer like I'm gonna get a
desktop computer but I'm like positive
that my dad won't let me like buy myself
one because he's gonna he probably
doesn't believe that my laptop doesn't
even work so whatever I don't know um
but yeah today I decided that I'm just
gonna do a vlog just because I haven't
made a video in so long that I just
wanted to put a vlog on here so just
kind of talk to you guys and catch up on
things on some things and you know cuz
I've missed you guys so so so so so much
and like I don't even know why I'm
making videos I'm so like disappointed
in myself
so yes I I was thinking about putting
this wok on my second channel but then I
was like no like this gotta be our main
channel so yeah mmm anything new was
meaning it not really um thank you for
twenty four thousand subscribers oh my
god I think I just changed it like today
you're mister I don't know um and yeah
okay so first off let me try to think of
what I want to say cuz I have no idea
what I'm gonna say oh oh I got you okay
I can't even talk right now
um okay so this is kind of one of the
main things that I wanted to talk about
today's video and this is me asking you
guys a question and I mean it like to me
it's like really important because it's
kind of a big big thing okay it's are
really dark okay no oh okay um this is
kind of like a big deal for me and I'm
like so confused I had no idea what to
do so I just decided that I'm going to
ask few girls and guys in a video ok so
you guys are not gonna lose I tweeted
about it so some people were totally
agreed and some people did not at all
okay basically I'm going through this
like little like little midlife crisis
right now basically I want to go blonde
yeah I want to dye my hair blonde mm-hmm
I know I'm the stupidest person in the
entire world because Matt a while ago I
just like dyed my hair almost jet-black
it's so so dark and I want to cook fond
I'm pretty ridiculous I know I'm going
to show you guys a picture of like how I
want my hair to be if I cook for long
kind of like that or like that kinda
yeah just like a bunch of like different
like highlights so blonde all over the
place and like different like shades of
and stuff I would never ever just bleach
my entire head like honestly that is
like one of the worst things you could
ever do so I've never do that even if I
have our dico blonde all I would do is
like first start out by getting caramel
highlights everywhere and then just like
wait a couple weeks and then slowly get
like lighter highlights over and just go
lighter light lighter to the point where
it's just kind of like different blonde
shades like all over in my hair if you
guys am saying so basically I want you
guys to come below and tell me what you
guys think I should do don't tell me
that it's that I'm going to do how much
my hair a lot because I know that like
legit I've like research this and I know
that it is really bad for my hair it's
totally just like go blonde and all that
stuff so I mean that's not really the
reason why this is stopping me like I
really don't care about that because I
never really ever used heat to my hair
like I never straighten it like this is
my natural hair I never blow dryer I
always like let it air dry and stuff
like that so it's not like my hair is
damaged at all because I try to like
take care of it as fast as I can by like
not using Heath ever so yeah the only
thing that's stopping me is just that I
like my dark hair like I don't know this
is a problem and I just I mean I think I
was look fine as a blonde I because my
hair at one point was like almost blonde
is really light because my
hair color is like a light brown and I
was almost blown at one point and so I
don't really think that is also another
reason why I wouldn't dye my hair blonde
it's not because I don't think I would
look good in blonde hair because like
for example when I did my hair really
dark a lot of people were like oh my god
don't do it you're gonna look horrible
keep go blonde go light her hair and
stuff like that and then I don't my hair
and bam I work in you know I'm not gonna
like know everything um but I mean it
didn't turn out like bad or anything you
know so I think I just kind of have that
that like look where I can just kind of
do whatever like blonder Brown so that's
not really why the reason that it's like
I'm hesitant about it is like that a
frayed that it'll look bad that's not
the reason I think during it the reason
is I just don't know if I want to stay
dark or blonde like I don't know I think
I'm gonna go blonde like over the summer
I'm just gonna slowly do it like I'm
gonna do the lemon trick with the Sun
and just kind of slowly slowly be going
blonde but like for now I'm not gonna do
anything to my hair like I'm gonna wait
till the summer
all right here's like a better picture I
like it like that yeah just a couple of
what you guys would think I should do
should I keep it or go blonder I don't
even know mm-hmm I know I'm gonna damage
your hair so much but I don't really
think about that oh sorry I just I don't
know
and also another reason is I just hate
filling in my eyebrows every single day
because when I go something and that's
gonna sting is gonna like wash off and
stuff like that so that's also like a
big issue I hate hate hate hate hate
filling in my eyebrows and it sucks
because like obviously you have to make
it like match my hair and that's what
really sucks so if I was blonde I
wouldn't have to do that so yeah that's
one of the big things that I want to
talk about today because obviously I
want year guys input on it and thoughts
about it because obviously you're gonna
have to be looking at my hair every
single
and yeah that's that I'm not naming one
is not hot today it's just like asking
you guys what you think and stuff like
that
and what else I don't know there's
really nothing new with my life how are
you guys like how are you feeling stuff
like that I'm so sorry dude making
videos Oh another thing I want to
mention is I know that I haven't made
tutorials in a really long time
but I really want to do them so
basically on my Facebook fan page which
I will link it will be the first link in
the downbar I want you guys to send me
photos of a celebrity's like hair style
or makeup look or something like that
and if you want me to like recreate that
look because I don't really have any
like fresh ideas on like tutorials and
stuff like that so just leave some
pictures on my Facebook fan page of like
maybe looks that you would want me to
recreate and I would love to do them so
that's what I hope you guys will do I
already have a couple of ideas in my
head and stuff like that or announced
tutorials I don't know just least one
requests on my Facebook fan page because
I like to go on there and that's
basically it so you see how long this
videos 9 minutes that's pretty long so
I'm gonna go for now but I will
definitely make a video soon do not
think that I'm gone or anything I didn't
die I'm sorry that I so am ia also make
sure to subscribe to my second channel
which is beyond Beauty star TV I decided
that I'm going to be doing a lot more
vlogs in there because I kind of like
neglected that channel and this channel
so I'm going to try and do a lot lot lot
more vlogs than that one so if there is
not many on here then go on there
because there's gonna be a lot on there
there I mean so I'll talk to you guys
for another video and
very soon and that's about it so yeah
