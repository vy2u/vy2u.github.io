yeah super Beauty here on YouTube and
today we created a new ish tag we looked
online and there were a few things kind
of similar to it but we're kind of doing
something a little bit different I'm not
sure if anyone has actually done like
exactly this kind of video I don't think
so
there's like ones like bitch yeah just
abusing her like basically we just put a
bunch of youtubers in here I threw in a
bunch she did so you don't really know
what we chose but we're just gonna be
choosing through here and then we have
some markers and paper and basically
we're going to choose out of the bowl
and we're not going to show each other
what we got we're going to have to draw
the youtubers on paper and then the
other person has to guess who each room
also we only get one try to guess who
the other person drew and if we get it
right then we get to keep the drawings
and then at the end we'll see like how
many we count it up and we'll see who
won the challenge I like actually
nervous like Lauren is it Laura no I
like I thought it was a pizza so you're
saying that Lauren who likes to eat no
she has a dress it says something about
people we talked about okay okay she's
holding something come on
let's just show what you have to go far
here would you be able to guess who that
ad you you're not getting the hint oh
you're right angles
does someone strawberry electric that's
a strawberry it's like a little bees and
those this looks like a frickin pizza
okay okay oh gosh oh here better than a
stick
Oh God okay that's a really big back out
yes okay he has he doesn't have this
long of a neck but I don't know why I
just did that
is that Casper no okay cause he looks
good Oh Joey is it Joey
yes because like the hair he kind of has
like hair that causes yes like okay yeah
kids they had some like I'm gonna draw
like okay he's the Shaytards
Shh are it's all up okay I can't think
of any other way to draw him like that's
him okay no this is this is unfair see
I'm not gonna get the point draw like a
hint like is he holding something what
does he do on YouTube any crime I don't
even and what doesn't he do
why is his beard so sparse looking
because he has a sparse appearing like
this is can you guys guess who this is
yeah that's probably not yeah hoo hoo
later like does he like purposely not
shave his beard I don't know it's just
kind of like he has a little bit of
sometimes a little bit of it what kind
of dirty
is it Shane Dawson yeah scruffy okay
okay okay I'm sorry that literally oh my
god this is such a good drawing that's
like talking let me draw an environment
it looks like he's underwater underwater
oh oh my god this is like so afraid ah
someone from California okay okay wait
um you don't sing okay I know I'm Hannah
and I quit wait honestly you have
someone singing on a row no this is a
row what does not look like a road
there's a beach this is the setting this
is the exact setting perfect you've got
the person talking with a microphone in
someone videotaping them in that setting
on the being insane Kassem G nice try it
was pepper he does that it's got like
that crazy hair no and you should have
done a collar like a little chain some
skinny jeans it's stuck okay so I guess
those are bets
what is that is that a person can we
just show right let's just smash this is
on you're driving yes this way do I know
this youtuber oh my god yes I don't know
how you haven't gotten this that's all
I'll give you honestly I would have

like I always drawn them with their
mouths open
