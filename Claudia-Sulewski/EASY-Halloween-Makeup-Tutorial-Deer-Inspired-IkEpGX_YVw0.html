show you guys how to create this deer
inspired makeup so easy I did it last
year for Halloween and I got a bunch of
requests on it so I'm starting off with
my regular face makeup and then adding
bronzer onto my eyelids to sort of
darken them up and I'm also adding it on
the lower lash line then I'm grabbing
the lorac Pro mega 3 palette which is
incredible I'm using this bronzy
shimmery color and adding that to the
outer half of my eyes and kind of
dragging it in for a little more
dimension the eye liner might be my
favorite part of this makeup but to make
my life a little easier I'm creating my
wing with some black eyeshadow and an
angled brush and then over that I'm
going in with a very fine liquid
eyeliner so you're going to drag it all
the way into your inner tear-duct and
create a little triangle shape and
filling that in I think it looks so cool
and just make sure to match them up make
sure they're even on both sides and then
after that I'm just adding some black
eyeshadow onto my lower lash line to
balance everything out next up I'm using
my Urban Decay white eye pencil and I'm
adding that into the inner tear ducts of
my eyes as well as underneath my wings
and I find that this really makes your
eyes stand out and pop and of course to
make sure that lasts all night just set
it with some white eyeshadow of course
curl your eyelashes and throw on some
mascara I'm using roller lash by Benefit
time for the nose I'm using my benefit
gel liner that pushes out and basically
you just start drawing the nose and kind
of you know go easy at first you can
bring it up and yeah just kind of figure
out the shape that you like also get up
in those nostrils make it look real
after that I'm using that same white
eyeliner
and creating dots on my forehead all the
way out to the ends of my brows and then
also I did the same thing right
underneath my eyes you'll see that right
now and I'm just kind of randomly
placing them on my cheekbones I forgot
to set them until later so we'll see
that later but now I am throwing on my
lipstick I'm wearing bites and it's the
shade blondie it is such a pretty nude
it's a little more Brown toned so I'm
just applying that to my lips and then
here we go
Claudia remembers to set her little
spots for the antlers I just wore these
same pair that I made from last year but
they're basically just made out of pipe
cleaners wrapped with Garten tape and
then I hot-glued some roses onto a
headband it was very easy but that is it
for today's quick makeup tutorial I hope
you guys enjoyed it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
