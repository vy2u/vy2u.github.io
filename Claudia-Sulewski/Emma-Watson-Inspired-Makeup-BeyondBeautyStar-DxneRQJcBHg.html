guys how to recreate this makeup look
worn by the beautiful Emma Watson I'm
starting out by priming my face with the
benefit Porefessional primer after that
I'm covering up all my imperfections
with the Neutrogena skin clearing
oil-free foundation Emma Watson has no
dark circles but I do so I'm using my
instant age rewind eraser to cover up my
under-eye circles
after that I'm just setting my face
makeup with my Maybelline fit me pressed
powder
taking my pixie beauty bronzer in the
shade of summertime I'm blending at the
product down my neck and also contouring
my face including my jawline my
cheekbones and my temples to moisturize
my lips I'm using my em cosmetics pillow
plush lip balm starting out with the
first eyeshadow I'm taking the Urban
Decay's sin and just applying it all
over my lids
after that I'm darkening up my crease by
using Urban Decay's eyeshadow in the
shade naked and just fluffing it in with
a big Brush to add in a hint of gold I'm
taking half baked and applying that into
my crease as well
to add more depth into the look I'm
taking urban decay's smog and applying
this into my crease as well make sure
you blend everything out after that I'm
going in with a darker gray eyeshadow
and applying this into the outer V of my
eyes to brighten up the look I'm going
back in with that first eyeshadow and
just applying it more into the inner
half of my eyes rather than using
eyeliner I'm taking a black eyeshadow
and just patting it onto the outer half
of my upper lash line and it's just
gonna give a really smoked out and soft
effect to add in that pop of silver
I'm taking my star luxe gem eye pencil
and just adding that to my lower lash
line after that I'm setting the eyeliner
with my beige cosmetics galaxy chic
baked eyeshadow in the shade which is a
really pretty silvery color then I'm
just going to clean up my look with a
nude eyeshadow and just applying it on
my brow bone underneath my eyes and my
inner tear-duct I'm finishing off my
eyes by applying on my favorite mascara
to my upper and lower lashes
here is a close-up of my eye makeup
compared to a mas M us cheeks were super
rosy so I'm going in with my bare
minerals blush in the shade the French
kiss for lips I'm starting off with a be
a bombshell lip crayon in the shade
shameless and these lip crayons are
super creamy and long-lasting and are
super easy to apply on Emma also had a
hint of orange in her lips so I'm taking
the Tarte lipstick in the shade fierce
and just patting it on the center of my
lips to get Emma Watson's flawless skin
I prepped it by using my glam glow youth
mud exfoliator which you just rub into
your skin and you leave it on for 10
minutes and it helps to tighten up your
pores and exfoliate your dead skin cells
so you can do that before you do any of
your makeup to brighten up your face</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
