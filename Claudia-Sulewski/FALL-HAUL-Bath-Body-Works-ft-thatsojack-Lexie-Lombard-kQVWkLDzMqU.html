and please look at the camera uh yeah
we're filming we're rolling now hey guys
I am with Jack uh and oh yeah we did
today we were going to be showing you
guys what we bought excited but first
but before we get into the hall I
quickly want to mention that this past
weekend I attended the Teen Vogue young
Hollywood party and I actually got to
host the red carpet for Teen Vogue and
interview all the celebrities over there
I just want to let you guys know that
that video is up on Teen Vogue's YouTube
channel so I will be linking it down
there and I am so happy with how it
turned out it was so amazing and it's
just awesome so you guys want to check
it out see who I talked to you on the
red carpet you can watch it down there
but let's get into this home now oh yeah
Abby first I don't remember buying this
every time I go shopping they were
actually having a sale with these mason
jar candles it was like 4/20 my buck for
real
be set pumpkin apple let's just what is
our approach in the moment around love
it taking me back to Connecticut yeah I
know I like that a lot
yeah it's a really nice spot beside
we're planning it tonight okay so the
next apartment smell the cloudy I are
gonna be enjoying with Jack is Hot
Buttered Rum I did not smell this one
it's very strong it's very buttery
okay go ahead it smells like a kitchen
mix it with another say I'm only vanilla
it would really really sweet honey give
me like a teak wood or something yeah
well I already lit this candle but it's
another amazing jar the liner slipped
into the wind snow slopes
it smells like kind of wintery snowy
snow I like the clean smells for my room
for my command that looks after the
colors way yeah I felt like for me
personally yeah little selection was
just very limited because I have a white
room and I really just wanted a white
candle and we just they really didn't
have any way I know
choices there it's the one that I chose
the next time I got it is autumn sky so
Lindsey and Megan have this their
apartment in the second I smelled it I
played the initial thought in my head
was wow this smells like Jack because
this is what he smells like my like a
Gucci cologne any time I'm not with Jack
I could just light this candle and I'll
feel like I'm with you you know so it's
like
that's very true it is probably never
gonna happen
all right the next little bit so my
second one on the two for 20 I went for
it
the vanilla snowflake because I needed a
white candle it's not been already smart
I like to my second mason jar candle is
mahogany teak wood it is not white but
you know I took a risk to the chance
it's because of the cologne smell that
it gives off it definitely smells like
Hollister now a combi but I do enjoy
that because it's kind of rare to find
that in a candle scent I love this once
I have a candle enthusiast but mainly
it's a manly what do candles that I got
are green apple orchard I was not
present for many of these decisions so
this is a surprise for me as well it
smells great so it does smell pretty
good fresh it's a nice break from the
fall yeah the last cattle that I got is
leaves and honestly surprised that these
two don't know what it smells like
because leaves is like the beauty good
here not a beauty but it's the beauty
guru candle like everyone it was
obsessed with it last year to try to
guess what it smells like I think it's
gonna smell a lot like my cologne kind
of ones like a very much oh you're going
eerie I was like oh no I want you're
sick serious I know so well let me get
my
the aroma is going to smell musky but it
smells like like a mixture of like
spices and love it's like I know it's
bad when it's lit though I can see this
100 really good when it's like Lexie all
right take it away the first one is my
favorite night bomb and that's their
name not mine I wanted wow talk about a
product it's called my favorite night
like that so that's so you know it quick
to say yeah quite a bold name they got
there it's an 8 hour overnight recovery
I've yet to use it but I'm looking for a
lip balm with SPF bill pellets for
submission thick can I go a little you
always get a little devil I mean I guess
I'll dabble with it I'm gonna feel the
same very fact it's an 8 hour overnight
recovery recovery sorry so do you put
this on before bed I feel really glossy
right now me too
oh man it's so bossy what do you married
there I want to end off my little haul
for you guys or unlike my end with
getting kind of sensual with you so this
is my blackcurrant vanilla body lotion
in it you know put a little love in the
air it's a blackcurrant absolute as far
as height and sexuality well vanilla
absolute is soothing Wow night is going
to get ready I mean I for the night I'm
happy great candle lit I know that small
sexual I just didn't
average cream did I say this was a halt
this is actually a first impressions
video oh this is nice
it's very nice it's all life its
language life it is so it's so key I got
two different room sprays so I got the
scent leaves which we just smelled I
mean you can't you can't really smell it
but you know just pretend that no it's
not exactly and then I also got
marshmallow fireside which smells so
good here let me just spray it yeah oh
yeah oh yeah wait wait wait
it does not smell like so my final item
which is also a room spray is also
mahogany teak wood like the candle that
I have very manly very Abercrombie and
fetch my room basically just smells like
a clothing store yeah the next thing
that I got was a fragrance refill for
the car freshener and once yeah this
book thank you lady thank you but this
is in the center it escape you won't be
able to smell it it's basically just a
very tropical scent it kind of smells
like a mix of like a pina colada and
sunscreen I also recently got one of
those like Wallflower things that you
plug into your wall and I ran on as the
scent that I was using it so I found
this one and this is smoked berries and
incense
it's something really really sweet
favori desecrated you see no the candle
smell really good I think it's the fact
that it's so potent in this form that
you have to wait until it's in the world
you know the last five things that I got
are all hand sanitizers because they're
having a deal five four five I feel like
that's like yearly like it's all year or
five four five that's always the bad
yeah okay well you but I wanted them for
all my purses so this one is sick over
here so actually it's great that I
bought these the first one is dazzling
diamond and it's probably pretty like
sparkles in it does this help you here
is doing like analyze the sparkles the
next one I got is pure paradise it's a
nice blue color no sparkles this time
it's so funny leaving that you're just
talking the next one is pear I love the
smell of pear actually kind of taste
wrong
if I'm like this the second to last one
is California dreamin I figured you know
we live in California and be appropriate
to buy this one yeah gotta choose as the
fifth I don't really know I don't really
smell it anymore I've lost weight
that one might smell kind of good it
doesn't smell as strong as the others or
my nose is just I can't get it straight
over one - is everyone last but not
least this is the last one this is
vanilla berry sorbet and like it was
no I'm sorry you caught me be really
slow though so I think this is where we
end up today's video thank you to Jack
and Lexie for baby give a big thumbs up
if you guys want to see these cases
there's one more like I look at of you
guys were always together and that's
about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
