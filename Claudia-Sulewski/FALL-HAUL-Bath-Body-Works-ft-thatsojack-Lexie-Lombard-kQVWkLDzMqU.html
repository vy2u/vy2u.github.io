and please look at the camera hi hi yeah
we're filming we're rolling now hey guys
i am with jack oh yeah and Lexi oh yeah
we did oh yeah we did today we're going
to be showing you guys what we bought
but excited but first ah but before we
get into the hall I quickly want to
mention that this past weekend i
attended the Teen Vogue young Hollywood
party and I actually got to host the red
carpet for Teen Vogue and interview all
the suburbs over there I just want to
let you guys know that that video is up
on Teen Vogue's youtube channel so i
will be linking down there and i'm so
happy with how it turned out it was so
amazing and it's just awesome so you
guys want to check it out see who I
talked to you on the red carpet you can
watch it down there but let's get into
this whole now be first I don't remember
buying this classic me every time I got
shopping they were actually having a
sale with these mason jar candles it was
like 24 20 maybach for realistic super
fussy said pumpkin Apple let's just what
is our apartment in the mall at around
oh yeah I love it it take me back to
Connecticut yeah I know I like that a
lot yeah it's a really nice website
we're planning it tonight America okay
so the next apartment smell the cloudy
and I are going to be enjoying with jack
is hot buttered rum I did not smell this
one it's very strong it's very buttery
okay what in Teddy smells like a kitchen
mix it with another say emilynoel it
would compromise
really really sweet and it gave me like
a teak wood or something yeah yeah get
really into it we do like travel
enthusiast candle rienner melt the wax
and put it oh that's a game changer
shape well I suddenly already lit
this candle but it's another mason jar
um I hope the later slipped into the
whigs snow slopes it smells like kind of
wintry snowy smell like the clean smell
to my room for my god what she really
wanted also liked them and it looks
after the colors wife awesome feel I
felt like for me personally yeah what
else election are just very limited
because i have a white room and I really
just wanted a white candle and we just
they really didn't have any way I know
choices it's the one that I chose I
honestly the next time I got it is
autumn sky no one guy got autumn sky so
Lindsey and Megan have this their
apartment in the second I smelled it I
play the initial thought in my head was
wow this smells like Jack because this
literally smells like my like a gucci
cologne anytime I'm not with Jack I
could just light this candle and I'll
feel like I'm with you you know so it's
like well yours oh that's very true it's
probably never gonna happen alright
that's gonna be a little bit Christmas
raises so my second one on the 24 20 I
went for it the Vanilla's snowflake
because i needed a white candle it's not
the baby already smell like it i like
the vanilla nice the headaches i think
it was a winner
the vanilla so my second mason jar
candle is mahogany teak wood it is not
white but um you know I took a risk to
the chance it's because of the cologne
smell that it gives off it definitely
smells like hollister and abercrombie
but I do enjoy that because it's kind of
rare to find that in a candle scent I
love this one size of candle enthusiasts
mainly it's a manly man it's an amicable
life is good plastic handles that I got
our green apple orchard I was not
present for many of these decisions so
this is a surprise for me as well it
smells great so it does smell pretty
good it's fresh yeah it's a nice break
from all the fall yeah we're buying I
wouldn't you know like oh yeah yeah the
last cattle that I got is leaves and
honestly surprised that these two don't
know what it smells like because leaves
is like the beauty or not a beauty guru
but it's the beauty guru candle like
everyone it was obsessed with it last
year to try to guess what it smells like
I thought it's gonna smell a lot like
Michael own kind of bones like a very
much how are you going to serious I was
like I would smell like leaves oh no I
want your sis serious I know so well let
me get my candle enthusiast since going
on it I smell the aroma is going to
smell musky but cold oh I don't think we
need to go complicate I think it smells
like on like a mixture of like spices
and love it's to feel like I know it
sounds bad when it's lit though okay I
can see this one oh really good when
it's like Lexie all right take it away
the first one is my favorite night balm
and that's their name not mine I wanted
Wow be talking about a product so gets
called my favorite nightfall literally
nothing widens like that so that's so
you know like quick to say
my favorite lip balm yeah quite a bold
name they got there it's an eight hour
overnight recovery I've yet to use it
but I'm looking for a lip balm with SPF
I feel pellets for sedation thick can I
get a little you always get a little
devil oh you dappled I mean I guess I'll
dabble with it is our let your I'm gonna
feel the same very fact it's an eight
hour overnight recovery recovery
recovery i would sorry so do you put
this on before bed mmm I feel really
glossy right now me too oh man it's so
bossy would you marry there I want to
end off my little haul for you guys I'm
like Mayan with getting kind of sensual
with you oh so this is my black currant
vanilla body lotion in it you know put a
little love in the air to black card
absolutely as far as height and
sexuality Walton vanilla absolute is
soothing Wow night is going to get ready
I mean I the sunshine before the night
it has been great candle lit I'm so good
I don't know that like things cuz that's
more essential cream I just didn't want
an average cream did I say this was a
haul this is actually a first
impressions video mine oh this is nice
it's very nice it's all over there it's
like it's like it's like it is so it's
all good so it's silky
it's very hot Oh y'all you're the vice I
got two different room sprays so I got
the scent leaves which we just smelled I
mean you can't you can't really smell it
but you know just pretend that you
install the kiss exactly and then i also
got marshmallow fireside which smells so
good here let me just spray it oh yeah
oh yeah oh yeah wait okay oh wait wait
wait no I was just you're like oh this
is really good that's what and in our
living room this will look great it does
not smudge marshall mathers eyes but yes
so my final item which is also a room
spray is also mahogany teak wood like
the candle that I have very manly very
Abercrombie and fetch my room basically
just smells like a clothing store yeah
the next thing that I got was a
fragrance refill for the car freshener
and you weren't yes book thank you thank
you but this is in the scent Caribbean
escape you won't be able to smell it
it's basically just a very tropical
scent it kind of smells like a mix of
like pina colada and sunscreen I also
recently got one of those like
Wallflower things that you plug into
your wall and I ran on is the set that I
was using it so I found this one and
this is smoked berries and incense yes
it's something really really sweet fairy
dust cranberry juice no the candle smell
really good I think it's the fact that
it's so potent in this form that you
have to wait until it's in the world you
know the last five things that I got are
all hand sanitizers because they're
having a deal 545 I think that's like
yearly like it's all year or 545 that's
always the back yeah it's over
that's great and I'm on my back
okay well I wanted them for all my
purses so this one is sick over here so
actually it's great that i bought these
first one is dazzling diamond and it's
probably pretty like sparkles in it is
this happy to hear you're like analyze
the sparkles you know I think only IV
desert next one I got is pure paradise
it's a nice blue color no sparkles this
time it's so funny thinking that you're
just talking I handsome I know this is
solely be sanitized my hands the next
one is pair I love the smell of hair
actually kind of too strong if I was the
name now I like this the second to last
one is California dreamin I figured you
know we live in California and be
appropriate to buy this one yeah I gotta
choose as the fifth I don't really know
I drunk so much that I can't really
smell it anymore I've lost weight that
one might smell kind of good it doesn't
smell as strong as the others or my nose
is just I can't get it straight over 1
minus several last but not least this is
the last one guy this is vanilla berry
sorbet like ever smell typical means no
I'm sorry you caught me baby really slow
so I think this is where we end up

Lexie for babies I do you a big thumbs
up if you guys want to see these guys
