today's video is going to be a fall
lookbook where I show you guys four at
different outfits but before we get into
that I quickly wanted to mention that
this video was made in collaboration
with a video that I made for Maybelline
I will have it right up here if you guys
want to check it out but basically I go
on a little shopping adventure at
Walmart to pick up some of my favorite
Maybelline lipsticks I am going to be
creating four different fashion looks
that are inspired by a certain lip color
so the first one is one of the color
sensational Vivid's lipstick and this is
in the shade pink pop which is the
brightest bubblegum hot pink I've ever
seen next up we've got one of my
all-time favorite lipsticks from them
and this is in the shade of cinnamon so
it's kind of like a nudey brown color
definitely on the deeper side but this
one has a satin finish the third one is
one of their color sensational matte
lipsticks so it's not going to have any
shine to it and this one is in the shade
divine wine which is a super deep dark
brick red perfect for the fall time so
definitely had to include this one any
last one is also a matte lipstick and
this is in the shade ravishing rose and
it's really pretty because it's still
very pink but it's got more of like a
darker Mavi tint to it so those are the
four lipsticks that I will be basing all
of my outfits off of and let's get into
the lookbook for the first look I wanted
to keep it very simple to have all the
attention on the lips so I'm just
wearing a black simple dress with black
booties
since the lip color and my second look
is a lot more casual I decided to do the
same with my outfit so I'm just wearing
a classic Claudia outfit so nice moto
jeans a t-shirt a jacket very simple but
definitely great for any type of
occasion look number three has got to be
my favorite look because I feel like a
dark red lip just gives you a really
mature vibe so I really wanted this
outfit to be a little more high-fashion
I just feel like a really savvy like
businesswoman in this outfit I don't
know I love it
my last and final look definitely has a
girlier vibe but it's still pretty
casual so I thought that went really
well with the light pink lips so I'm
just wearing these really cute flowy
shorts with leotard and kind of making
it more casual with the denim jacket
you
so that is it for my fall lookbook I
hope you guys enjoyed it make sure to
check out the video that I created with
Walmart and Maybelline it turned out
really cute so we'll have it linked down
below and at the end of this video but
that is it I will see you guys for a new
video next week and I love you guys bye
today I'm looking for some new lip
colors with all of the options there is
absolutely no excuse to wear the same
lipstick every day
so let's go shopping</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
