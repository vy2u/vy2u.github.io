fashion haul I just quickly wanted to
mention that I ended my tennis season
today which is sad but it's also good
because I finally have time to film
videos again so I'm officially back on
YouTube I have a lot of stuff to show
you guys I'm pretty sure this is the
biggest haul that I've ever done all
stuff is on my bed so I'm just gonna get
right into it because I don't want it to
be too long okay so the first things
that I recently got or these boots right
here and these are from Schumann's and
they're just black they have buckles on
the side and they're travel pretty I
will be filming an outfit of the day
with these very soon so stay tuned for
that video so the next couple of items
I'm going to be showing you are all from
chick Nova calm and I'll have their link
in the downbar but they have recently
become one of my favorite websites they
are literally like land of sweaters I'm
obsessed with all their chunky knit
sweaters so I did buy a couple of things
from them so first starting out I got
these little leggings shorts and
obviously I wouldn't wear these as
shorts but they go halfway down my thigh
or maybe a little bit less and they have
lace on the bottom and these are great
for if you are if it's kind of warmer
outside you can wear these with like a
really long chunky sweater that covers
your butt obviously and then you could
just wear boots with it so I got these
because I think that they will work very
well with different outfits then I also
got these leggings right here and I've
been wanting these for so long they're
like the kendall Jenner leggings so
they're just black and then on the front
they have all these rips so you can see
that they starve up pretty high on this
leg and then they go pretty much all the
way to the bottom so the third thing
that I got from chicken OVA or it might
be pronounced chic Nova I'm not really
sure but whatever so the next piece that
I got was very like risky and daring for
me because I never ever thought that I
would buy these type of pants I thought
they were so ugly but when I saw them on
the website they actually looked really
cute and they are MC Hammer pants but
they're a little bit more of
relaxed version so they're black and
then at the top they just have a little
you know strings to make knots and they
have really baggy pockets on the side
and then it just gets tired on the
bottom but they're still kind of loose
at the bottom they're not like
completely like legging tight so that's
what I like about them they're a little
bit more subtle but I'm not really sure
how I'm gonna style these yet but I'm
really really excited for these they
actually look really nice on so I've two
sweaters to show you guys the first one
is this grey kind of cardigan style
sweater and I like the material of it
because they're like little loops which
is kind of interesting and different and
then they just have buttons going down
so this will be very easy to match with
different outfits also a lot of their
things on the website are one size fits
all which is actually awesome because
you know when you're online shopping
it's just one less thing you have to
worry about choosing the right size so
the next sweater that I got is this
bright yellow one that my lighting is
being really Orange and weird but this
is literally like bright bumblebee
yellow it just looks like this it's your
basic like Nick sweater and the yellow
one was on sale so that's why I wanted
to try this one to see if I like the
sizing and I really like it so it comes
in different colors and I think I might
purchase a couple of different colors
there the last thing that I got from
their website was this black purse right
here and it's very small and simple but
it just spoke to me when I saw it online
so I think it is very unique because
it's more of like a square purse so on
the back it has a zipper pocket and then
on the sides and also has pockets right
here that close and at the top it has
just a little handle so you can hold it
it opens up like this which I think it's
just so cute it's like a little square
inside so I love this purse it's gonna
go with a lot of my things obviously
because it's black so next I bought a
bunch of stuff from a brandy Melville
because they are one of my most favorite
stores
if not the most favorite so first I'm
just going to show you guys some shirts
that I got so this one is like a brown
kind of tan color and it looks very
simple in the front and then in the back
it goes really low so it's gonna look
really cute with a bando then I also got
this shirt which may seem kind of short
but it looks so pretty with like
high-waisted skirts high-waisted shorts
and all that good stuff so it looks like
this if it looks really small it's kind
of more of like a bralette shirt thing
but it's spaghetti straps it's pink and
floral
it's very flowy and then also I got this
basic white t-shirt and it just says la
with bones on it so it's just really
comfy and casual next I got this shirt
which is pretty simple but it's like a
pink kind of burnt brown color I thought
it's really interesting and the back
goes really really low so I think that's
very cute and then I also got this tank
top if you guys cannot tell I kind of
went insane on brandy melville because I
don't know many of their things so I
kind of went on like a mini shopping
spree on their website but I got this
one which is white and it's cropped and
has a black elephant on it and I'm
obsessed with this I already wore it
because I loved it so much and then I
got one last shirt and then I have two
other things but or no three so it looks
like this it's just a black crop top and
it says NYC with bones so it's kind of
like the same theme as the white shirt
and then I got three wow that was weird
does that anyways I got three other
things I got two skirts and the first
one is just the simple black just flowy
skirt and I feel like this is just an
essential that you need and I do not own
any black skirts so I bought that and
then I also got another skirt and I'm so
excited for this this is my first maxi
skirt so it's very simple as well it's
just a medium gray color
it's a maxi skirt and I can't wait to
wear it like tight at the bottom the
last thing I got I've been wanting for a
very very long time and I'm so excited
to wear this it looks like this it's
just a very very long knit cardigan it
just has a hood and a long sleeve and
it's very very cute so next I have a
bunch of stuff from go Jane calm which
has also been one of my most favorite
stores lately so first I'm just going to
show you guys some sunglasses that I got
because their sunglasses are really
really nice and unique but they're also
really inexpensive they're like five
dollars each so the first pair looks
like this they're very very different
but you know we'll see how that goes
then I also got these which I'm obsessed
with monkeys and then the last pair are
a little bit more not really out there
but these are cute as well then I also
got a purse from there it's more of like
a clutch it's kind of bigger than I
thought it would be in person but it
looks like this it's a black clutch with
a crossbody strap and I love it because
it has gold spikes on both ends then I
also bought a white dress that I
actually worked for homecoming so if you
guys have not seen that video then I
will link it down below but it's
actually dirty right now so I don't have
it with me but that is the dress then I
also got this dress which oh my gosh it
is so pretty the dress is a light pink
and it has a really pretty floral
pattern on it and then also on the
shoulders it has gold like circles on it
studying or whatever and it also has
these really cute small cutouts on the
front and on the back so I thought this
was very unique and I don't know what
I'm gonna wear it to but you know it's
always good to have back of dresses for
you know different events and stuff so
you guys know how I am with my crazy
statement leggings so of course I picks
them up so this pair is very similar to
the ones I showed you before except
these have cutouts on the sides and
serve the front and these are all even
cutouts too they're not like all
different
so I got those and then also I got this
pair which is so cool I'm so excited to
wear these so at the top they're just
black and they kinda like shorts and
then they have like this tan mesh on
your thigh and then it goes down to a
black with gold circles on it and it is
so pretty I'm very very excited to wear
these leggings and then next these are
pretty crazy I don't know I mean what
else we'll see how they work out but
there are white leggings and they switch
off from opaque to mesh so because
they're pretty crazy next up I got a
couple of shirts from go Jane and I have
recently been obsessed with fitted
cropped t-shirts so I already own a
couple of them but I got a couple more
because I'm obsessed with them so this
one is kind of wrinkly is already more
it but it's just tan and it's cropped
and it's tight and it looks beautiful so
there's that and then I also got a white
and black one but these are a little bit
different because they are off the
shoulder and they have a very subtle
like sweetheart neckline so they look
like that and they look very very pretty
on so I just got that in whites and
black next up I got this shirt that has
open shoulders to it and it's just white
and it has a gray cross on the front so
it's pretty simple but I think it's very
cute and then I also got this bra light
which I'm so excited to wear because I
don't know I've never seen anything like
it
so the front of it says drama and the
back says Queen and it has like this
kind of stone wash look to it and I
think it's gonna look really cute with
those shirts that I bought that have
like the open back and stuff so the last
thing I got from go Jane wear shorts and
I know that
obviously can't wear them during the
fall time but I just have to have them
because they were very cute
so they I'm sorry this is getting all
tangled okay so they look like this
they're just light blue denim shorts but
they are overall shorts so I think these
are going to be very fun to wear and I'm
planning on having them hang down like
next to my thighs like that instead of
having the straps on I think it's gonna
look very cute so I got those so then I
got two dresses from Nasty Gal calm and
they were both on sale so they were
around like 20 bucks each so you know I
had to get them the first one looks like
this though it's just white and for some
reason it has like black fuzzies on it
so try to ignore that if you can see it
but it has like this zigzag kind of line
pattern going on and it also has cutouts
on the sides and at the top it's just
like a tan skin colored mesh so love
this dress it's very cute and also the
back is all mesh so I probably have to
wear like a sticky bra with it but I
think this dress is very cute and then
the next one is pretty unique I don't
know but um the top looks like this so
it has a very high neckline and it's all
just a rainbow sequins and then it's
black and then at the bottom it has like
the sequins on the sides as well so I
think it's very interesting and
different and yeah so I got that then I
also got a bunch of stuff from forever
21 and I haven't shopped at forever 21
in such a long time but I decided to
give it another shot and I was actually
really really impressed with their
clothes I bought two pairs of leggings
and the first ones I've been really
loving so they're just black high
waisted leggings but they have some
details on the front they've got like
little fake pockets but I really really
like these because they are super thick
and super warm and they're not
see-through at all so it's not like
legging material but they're still
stretchy and they
look like leggings so those are super
great and then I also got these which
are of course crazy statement leggings
because I'm just a weird person and I
just really like my crazy leggings so
these are gray and black and they just
have stars and stripes going down on
each leg and these are sick they're
awesome then I got a couple of sweaters
and I was very impressed with their
sweaters oh my goodness so the first one
it looks like this it's just black in it
but on the shoulders it has two cutouts
if you can see that all right there you
go so you can see the one flap so it has
two cutouts on the shoulders so really
like that one then I also just got a
plain black knit sweater because I did
not own a plain black one and I feel
like this is just one of those essential
pieces that you need and a quick tip if
you want to buy sweaters that are a
little bit more loose fitting and
oversized definitely recommend looking
in the plus-size section this is in the
size 1x so it fits very nice and just
baggy on knees and then the next sweater
I got um I kind of thought it was cheesy
but I really liked it so I got it but
it's gray and it says love and pink and
black so it's pretty long and it's
really nice this looks so cute with like
black leggings and black combat boots I
actually wore earlier this week and then
the last sweater that I got from forever
21 was actually sweater dress and it's
just a thick cream color it has like two
little buttons at the top and it's also
quarter sleeve so it's just a knit dress
and this will be very cute to wear with
god I don't even know yet some kind of
boots and something else I don't all
figure it out but I thought this was
very cute next up I got a skirt and it's
just a teal high-waisted like pleated
skirt I've never owned a skirt like this
it's very cute I love the color so I got
that and I also got this lace tank which
is very cute I was actually really
surprised to see that forever 21
it sells shirts like these I don't know
why but it's like doesn't this look like
something that you buy it like Urban
Outfitters or like Free People or
something but it's lace all the way
around which is great because sometimes
they just make the back so the shirts
really plain so this chart is obviously
very well made so I was very proud to
buy that from forever21 then I just got
some randoms so I just got this gray
like knit hat thing and this is actually
from the men's section oh and I still
got my brother-in v-neck for no reason
but he liked it and then also I got
these socks which are just white and
they're long socks so these will be
great to tuck into boots and like slouch
them and then I also got some fuzzy
socks because I love ferritin ones fuzzy
socks they're only like four dollars and
they are super fuzzy the last three
things that I want to show you guys are
from a bath and Bodyworks and they're
not fall fashion related but they are
fall related so I felt like they fit
well in this video so I got three little
candles the first one is pumpkin caramel
latte and this one I think it's new
actually I'm not really sure but it
smells well again and then also I got
apple crumble which is like for sure one
of my favorites it's tied between this
and leaves but I really love both of
them and then I also got of course
leaves which I'm burning right now and I
also want to show you guys this candle
holder because I'm obsessed with it I
think it looks so pretty this is the
first one I've ever bought and it just
has leaves going all around it and it
matches with my room because it's silver
um so really really happy I got it my
mom was like why did you buy that but
you know it's it's cute you just gotta
buy it
I also really like the top of it because
it's uneven from all the leaves so I
feel like it just kind of gives it that
extra I don't know I just I don't know
it just looks good so that is it for my
fall fashion haul I'm so sorry that it
was so long but I'm very very
for all this stuff because I love
clothes and I am obsessed so I hope you
guys enjoyed today's video and I will
talk to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
