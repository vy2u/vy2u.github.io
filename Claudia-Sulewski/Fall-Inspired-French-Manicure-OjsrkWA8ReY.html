grabbing any nude nail polish and this
one is from sally hansen and you're just
going to apply this all over your nails
once you're done with that grab any
brown nail polish and i'm using this
trend of glaze one and all you're going
to do is create a french tip on the end
of your nails so once you've given your
nails some time to dry you're going to
start out by grabbing a yellow orange
and red nail polish and you're also
going to need some kind of dotting tool
or anything like that and I'm just going
to be using a toothpick so starting off
with the red I'm just going to dot it on
any hard surface like always and now
you're just going to start drawing on it
be leaves and I just want to say that it
doesn't have to be perfect at all as you
can tell that mine kind of sucks but no
one really cares so yeah you don't have
to make it perfect
so now I'm going to grab an orange nail
polish and this is peachy keen by China
Glaze and I'm just going to start
drawing more leaves and these kind of
have different shapes on trying to like
spice it up you know so yeah so lastly
i'm just going to be taking a yellow
nail polish and just finishing up with
the leaves
so once you're done with the leaves it
should look a little something like this
so next you're going to grab a white
nail polish i'm using this art deco one
and you're just going to start drawing
white lines in the lease just to give a
little bit more detail and of course you
do not have to be perfect at this at all
once you're done it should look a little
something like this and once you put
your nails dry just apply on your
favorite top coat and you're done so
obviously this tutorial is really fast
and easy and I hope you guys enjoyed it
