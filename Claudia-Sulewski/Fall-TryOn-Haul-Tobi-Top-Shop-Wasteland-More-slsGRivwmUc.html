today's video is going to be a try on
haul where I show you guys a bunch of
things that I purchased and then I show
you how they look when I wear them I
would definitely recommend grabbing a
snack possibly a beverage with you
because this video is about to get real
long because as always I just I bought a
lot I bought a lot I'm going to start
off with the things that I got from
Topshop and I only have four things not
very many so I got two pairs of shoes
the first pair looks like this and I
love these so much they're just little
slip-on sneakers and they have this
really cool black and white like reptile
prints black faux leather on the sides
and I know I'm just really really
obsessed with these they meant a lot but
they're still kind of unique and spunky
in their own way I also purchased some
fancier heels these are so beautiful
they look like this they're all black
leather and I just really like all of
like the little straps that you can see
all across the shoe yeah I thought these
are just really killer shoes that would
be perfect for nighttime
next up I got one skirt and I've already
worn this skirt like three times I think
because I just I'm so obsessed with the
color but it looks like this it's just a
simple kind of like a line shaped skirt
but it has a little V in the front as
you can see the zipper goes across the
front it's got pockets I just really
really love this color it reminds me of
the walls in my olds room throwback to
my old room the last thing that I got
from Topshop is kind of crazy and whack
and I never thought I would buy
something like this until I saw it in
the store and tried it on I also will
probably never wear this NLA figuring
that it will never get this cold but I
can definitely wear this in New York if
I go anytime soon or to Chicago when I
visit home but it is this super fluffy
fake fur coat and it looks insane I know
but it's so cute on it's just very like
Sex in the City Serena van der Woodsen
as
I don't know absolutely the shape of
this and I've always wanted just a
really fancy fur coat like this two days
ago I went shopping with my friends on
Melrose and if you guys live in this
area then you would know they're just a
bunch of different shops and boutiques
that you can check out so I bought a ton
of things and one of the first stores
that I went to was wasteland the first
thing that I got were these boots and
these were new they were not thrifted
because they did have a section of newer
shoes where you can choose like what
size you want and stuff like that these
are my new favorite shoes I've been
looking for combat boots that were
healed for the longest time and these
are like exactly what I envisioned they
zip up on the inside and they've just
got a chunky heel to them I'm just very
very happy with these shoes and they're
going to be like my go-to for this
season
yay I also got two lighter jackets the
first one looks like this it's like that
sporty chic style so it's got stripes on
the bottom a little bit right here in
the front and on the sleeves this is
from the brand v and I just thought it
was so cute it'll be so adorable at
night time I also got a UNIF leather
jacket that looks like this in the front
it's got like little rounded studs it's
a little bit ripped up and the back has
a cat on it I'm not quite sure if I want
to cover this yet though because it is
kind of crazy for me I really like the
like cheetah print right here but I
might take just like a black denim piece
of material and just stitch it over so
that it's just like a black bag or even
just possibly like a denim that would
match this color but as for right now
I'm just going to wear the cat a few
times and then probably just get it up
switching it out just to make it a
little bit more simple and stuff next up
I got this dark grey sweater I just
really liked the sleeves on this it kind
of looks like it's flipped inside out
because it's like that fuzzy looking
material but I thought that was a really
cool detail so I just thought this was a
really cute gray sweater for default
time next up I got a little pair of
floral shorts and I bought these to wear
underneath like short dresses
I just really liked the white lace on
the bottom of these and of course the
pattern is super super adorable and yeah
these are kind of summery but I think I
can work these well into the full time
and by the way these are by the brand
Audrey next up I got this black leather
skirt and this has got to be one of my
favorite purchases I've already warned
out and I got a lot of compliments on it
it's from the brand come with two M's
and I love this skirt because it has
shorts like attached underneath you guys
probably not going to see that but like
the blue skirt that I showed you guys
earlier it has a zipper that goes down
the front which I think looks really
cool and then zippers on the side love
it this skirts so much it's so awesome
for nighttime I've also really been into
leotards lately I think they look so
good when you wear jeans or like shorts
over them so the first one that I got is
from the brand rehab and it's just
pretty simple it zips on the back and I
like this one because it just dips
really low on the sides so when you're
wearing like jean shorts with it it just
looks so cool because it's super tight
on the front of the back but then it's
like open on the sides and then the
second one that I got is also from rehab
this one is a little bit more detailed
it's completely mesh except you've got
little like stitched on flowers that
kind of cover your boobs and go all the
way down to the bottom so this is a
really unique and kind of feminine
leotard and I think it looks really cool
so I'm excited to wear this with like
black jeans and a cool bra light
underneath or something like that so I'm
really really excited about those
leotards I got two little grey cropped
tops the first one kind of looks like a
little sweater crop top it's by the
brands cotton candy it just has a
rounded neckline in the front and then
in the back it dips down to AV and I
wore this with the leather skirt one
night and it looked so cool so I really
really like this top and the cut of it
then I've got this one this is just a
dark gray and it's a v-neck super cute
this is by the brand cotton candy as
well next up I got this light gray
cardigan and this one goes super long
this is my first time getting one of
those longer cardigans so I'm really
really excited to style this one but
it's just really light and thin and
flowy it's got pockets and it just goes
super far down the legs so I thought
this was a really unique piece and this
is by the brand honey lunch nope honey
punch
I cannot read cursive sometimes sorry
next up I got two addresses the first
one it looks like this it's that same
material as that other crop top but this
is kind of like a dusty rose dark pink
color I think this looks so cool with
like the black boots that I showed you
guys and maybe like a black leather
jacket for a nighttime look that's a
little bit more girlier this is also
from the brand cotton candy I got it
from wasteland
and I just love it I love it so much the
last thing that I purchased on that day
was this dress type thing I think it's
like a dress so to mix of black and
white thread so it has that
salt-and-pepper effect and it dips down
a really really low on the sides but
then also on the bottom it slits up
really high so that's why I didn't
really know if I should call this a
dress it's just kind of like a slip that
you throw over a crop top and like a
pair of shorts or something like that so
it's just kind of a fun piece to throw
over a little outfit and just kind of
make it look cool I don't know I'm
excited to style this lastly I bought a
bunch of things from Toby comm and
they're one of my go-to stores when I'm
online shopping so I got a lot of things
I'm actually gonna leave my like invite

them at all any of you guys can make

is awesome so if you guys want to check
out Toby comm you can click on the link
down there and when you sign up with
your Facebook account then you get 50%

incredibly amazing I remember like the
first time I had my first purchase I
probably spent like $1,000 worth of
clothes but only had to pay five hundred
so it is just like unbelievably amazing
so if you guys want to check them out
I'll have them down there but once again
they have no idea that I am making this
video for them or anything like that oh
yeah let's get in with what I got from
Toby the first thing I got was this
light pink crop top I really liked the
whole caged effect that it has on the
top actually almost wore this for
today's video but then I decided against
it but it's so so cute I just love the
color and I think this will be really
fun to wear next up I got this black
dress it has the same kind of caged
thing at the top it's just perfect for
any type of event or nighttime event or
something like that if I'm going out so
I thought this would be a really nice
just little black dress to add my little
black collection I also got this white
skirt it's pretty simple it also has
like a little I would show you guys the
back oops but it looks like this in the
front there you go it has a little fold
on the side but then on the other side
it's super cool because it has these
little cutouts right here so it's like
super edgy and risque and I think it'll
be really great to wear at nighttime
with other cute tops and stuff next up I
got BA what the next thing I got was
this shirt it's black mesh and it has
these beautiful white flowers across it
on the front and the back and I just
really like like see-through shirts
because you can wear really cool like
black bra lights underneath and looks
super awesome and cool and I think this
will look really cute with just some
black jeans or you know things like that
okay
this has got to be like my favorite
thing that I got from Toby this time
around I'm obsessed with it it is this
black like chunky casual ish sweater but
the shape of it is just absolutely
beautiful it'll be kind of hard to show
you guys but it's a super long and huge
oversized sweater and it zips up all the
way to the hood it's got pockets and I
just think this will look so cool with
any outfit underneath it it's perfect
for a night time to kind of throw over
like shorts and a crop top or even a
dress next up I got a simpler shirt this
is just a black kind of flowy shirt that
has little pockets on the boobies and a
little collar it's kind of fancier but I
thought this would be a really kind of
cute casual looking shirt the next shirt
I got is kind of crazy I don't really
know how I'm gonna wear it yet but it is
an all black mesh long-sleeve shirt
probably gonna wear others some really
crazy we're all led underneath it with
like a high-waisted skirt or I think
yeah that would be really cute or even
just like a cool tank top underneath but
you can really do a lot with mesh shirts
like this so yeah I got that shirt and
then the last and final thing that I got
from Toby and the last and final thing
that I got in today's video would have
to be this cropped sweater and if this
pattern looks familiar I actually have a
circle skirt from Nasty Gal that is this
exact like material and color and
pattern and everything I already tried
them together and they look super weird
but I think this would look really cute
with some like high-waisted skinny jeans
or even just like some shorts or
something but it is just a high-neck
sweater with longer sleeves and I just
thought it was super funky and cool so
that is so that is everything that I
recently purchased I hope you guys enjoy
today's try on haul I had so much fun
filming it for you guys
and now I'm just super excited to throw
all this stuff into my closet and put
them in their place and stuff which by
the way if you guys want to find out
what my closet looks like I will link it

talking all about how I like to organize
everything in my closet it's kind of
like a closet tour it's a super great
video if you haven't seen it you're
really missing out on life I don't know
why I didn't watch it you should watch

really annoying now so we're gonna push
that away and I'm going to end off
today's video so give this video a
