going to be showing you guys how I take
one look and transform it from daytime
to nighttime this video is actually
inspired by at my recent trip to New
York where I got to attend Fashion Week
with Maybelline and the trip was
incredible from going to see the shows
and seeing what people were wearing on
the runway to seeing different things
backstage it was just really fun I loved
it every time I'm in the city I always
like to look at the different things
that people are wearing and just pull
inspiration from their outfits and I
actually noticed that this year a lot of
people were throwing in daytime clothing
articles and incorporating them into
their nighttime outfit so that's kind of
where I got the inspiration to take very
simple outfits and turn it from daytime
to nighttime along with outfit I'm gonna
show you guys a daytime makeup look as
well as what I would do to transform
that look into a more nighttime
appropriate makeup look for the daytime
I like to keep my makeup pretty simple
and fresh looking but I always remember
to start off by priming my face today
I'm using my Maybelline at baby skin
instant pore eraser and just applying
that all over to brighten up my face I
like to use my instant age rewind
concealer in the shade brightener and
apply that on my under eye circles
I like to keep my makeup a very neutral
for the daytime but I always remember to
apply on a little bit of color onto my
face with some pink blush
for my daytime look I decided to throw
on a chunky light gray sweater to keep
the look comfy and warm I also added a
few mixed metals accessories to kind of
girly up the outfits and make it a
little bit fancier looking to finish off
the outfits I threw on some plain black
flats that are perfect to wear
throughout the day so now let's
transform our look from daytime to
nighttime so starting off with the
makeup I am going to completely
transform my look with only using one
palette this is the Maybelline expert
wear quad in the shade electric blue so
I'm starting off by grabbing at the
black eyeshadow and applying it into the
outer half of my eyes as well as into
the crease to add in a pop of color I am
throwing on it the light purple shade
and applying it onto my lid then
grabbing at the dark blue and applying
it into the outer half of my eyes as
well as in the crease this makeup look
goes perfectly with Maybelline's trend
of the month which is rock goddess so
after that I'm just applying on some of
the dark and purple eyeshadow onto my
lower lash line to help transform my
makeup from day to night I'm darkening
my lips with my Maybelline Color
sensational in the shade is cinnamon and
that is it for the nighttime makeup so I
was able to completely change the look
with only two products so now onto the
outfit rather than wearing the shirt
normally I decided to unbutton it and
throw on a tight black tank top
underneath to add a little bit more
layering and also a few on a black
leather jacket of course I'm wearing the
same a black high-waisted jeans and I
kept the jewelry very minimalistic and
sleek looking I love adding height to my
nighttime outfits so I threw on these
high platform black booties and that is
the completed look for next time
so that is it for today's video I hope
you guys enjoyed it to let me know a
which makeup look and which outfit you
guys liked the most and I will see you
guys for a new video next week bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
