with Connie's and Ellie Evans my super
movie I will leave their channels and
downbar and all three of us made videos
on each of our channels so I will make
sure to leave those in the downbar but
for my video we decided to create a
fault AK because who doesn't love a new
tab write love tag and it is called to
be fall in love tag so I guess we'll
just get started I get this is so basic
and everybody could say this but I
really like a good writing food I think
I don't know I think it is very like
flattering on everybody and it's just
like the epitome of fall so I just have
to say that I would have to say like
statement jackets like I've been really
obsessed with like bomber jackets like
the girly ones and then like I've been
obsessively Free People jackets as well
just the ones of like the designs on
them and stuff my favorite fall trend
has been the chunky sweaters over
dresses or skirts I really like that
like yeah come in yeah I'm like big and
comfortable but like girly on the bottom
I'm really like that look or I really
like the trend of monochromatic players
like gran-gran gray or like black and
black just really really chic looking
but super homeless uncomfortable
my favorite fall beauty product and I'm
someone where like I wear red lipstick
every single day of the year every
moment I wake up it's the first thing I
put on I love it and I'm for those your
teeth anything bad happens in life I'm
like just put on red lipstick and it's
gonna be okay so this is a Ruby woo from
Mac it's very velvety looking on your
lips it like looks like it's velvet on
your lips I don't know I love it and
it's really pretty and everyone else
that sees it on me seems to love it too
so my products is the buxom lipstick and
it's like in a stick form and this is in
the shade Shanghai and it's just like a
kind of cranberry whiney murder mandarin
is very violent looking without lip
color it's just very convenient cuz it's
in stick form so it's easy to apply it's
really pretty
my favorite is a lip stain I really like
these products because I'm lazy
so I put it on once if I might looks
like hours and my precious dato and it's
this super dark orange bright orange is
my favorite in summer this isn't like a
Thanksgiving pumpkin II kind of look and
this is orange by boat Ephraim should
say I don't love it and wearing it right
now we want to get but it's like perfect
for fall yeah early I am Starbucks and
those are really good but I really like
from Teavana I don't have the exact name
of it but I like tell - Claudia - down
below or something but it's a loose tea
and it's like a salted caramel cocoa tea
new - right the cocoa caramel tea there
we go it is heaven
with you my fall drink would have to be
the yogi tea I've just recently tried
this yet and it's so good it is the
caramel apple spice snack tea and it's
just really good it just tastes like
fall in a cup okay well I'm gonna go
like common girl like now your neighbors
like in the world and I'm gonna take
pumpkin spice lattes who would have
guessed you can't get through a fall
time without someone saying pumpkin
spice lattes it's so far it's been warm
since so I'm getting bites pumpkin spice
but I'm still doing like a chocolate oh
my god it's really oh look at 1:00
tomorrow it's so good apparently this
was supposed to be a candle but when I
thought since I thought perfume so this
is from Victoria's Secret and it's sexy
little things new are smells that's
really good it smells so good so high I
bought this what a travel because the
glass bottle is obviously really
breakable and I didn't want it to leak
everywhere so like you know I'm upset it
smells so good and then I guess it was a
big candle I like Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
leaves basic I'm gonna be a total like
common white girl with this one what is
it mahogany teak do I love it so much
it's almost exactly like Abercrombie and
it's just like kind of said like that I
really love the espresso candle - oh my
goodness it smells like coffee in your
house I love that scent but if I do pick
up curfew maybe Marc Jacobs Daisy it's
always my yeah false scent but I have a
lot of bad memories with the perfume
that's the food when I free fall in like
I'm gonna get rid of and I get some new
perfume Carmen I always have been
memories with it so I don't know what
that's those from me
okay Wow
I feel like I'm gonna insult a lot of
people when I say this right now so it's
like no offense to any particular person
but I have never been a fan of the whole
I'll tie the plaid shirt around your
waist thing I don't think it's
flattering at all I don't I don't know
maybe if you're like I don't like it I'm
sorry I totally did that dream like she
didn't do that in one of my videos I
think the trend that I hate which I mean
I kind of did it last year but now I'm
like completely over it and they don't
have to be patterned leggings like I
don't know if they're like subtle that's
different but like the crazy ones I just
I don't know like the same like just
stop trying to make sure it's happen
around your waist Gretchen like they're
never ever gonna were just done with it
like they're not happening
I really want to be boo from Monsters
Inc but like not like the little kid I
want to let's boot ever but I'm gonna be
like boo when they dressed her up as a
monster so like I full-on want to wear
like a giant purple sack with like fate
eyes coming off shove over my hand I
think would be I just like monster
saying sigh so are you gonna like make
that at home
oh yeah you bet you I wanna lie that
this is gonna sound so weird but I
recently got like this one dress it's a
watermelon dress it's cool though it's
like a bodycon dress without any
costumes though you just made out
exactly and it's like green at the
bottom and then it's like it has like
white and then it's like pink and it has
like polka dots it looks really cute on
I showed it in like a hall a long long
time ago but it just I'm gonna be a
watermelon I think I've done this for a
lot of years I did a DIY on at my
channel last year and my go-to is always
a Tiffany's box if I don't have anything
that I'm like dying to be like the
easiest costume to making it so cute
there's you know whenever dressing a
take me spot so girly last year I was
toddlers in tiaras and then I got a hot
mask you I mean it was crazy and that I
would love to the pink Power Rangers I
did go to like my party so I like
costumes were like differently
and we didn't plan something yeah did
involve honestly okay so since I guess
it's like fall right now right yeah okay
so I'm the type of person where I will
play one song over and over and over
again until I can't listen to any more
song killers meet you somewhere along
filler so the song I've been listening
to right now is called waiting all night
yeah I really like it I would have to
say alright for I have an artist Lorde
she's like my love yeah yeah I love
everything by her so I have like all her
songs and also I showed this is my
favorites video but I really like a ways
to go by group love
it has a slow beginning - like five
songs like I'd like five times that
around cute listening to you and it's
like I like Katy Perry war right now
which is embarrassing because I think
they overplayed them so much and like -
yeah - I know a
right now I'm like low-key diggin Katy
Perry born and I like safe and sound a
lot - let me - oh my god yes I saw that
song had just become like on their like
top charts of iTunes okay I listened to
that song literally a century ago like
when the like Hunger Games sing first
but I just no I don't understand why it
suddenly became was it on a show or
something like Wyatt in hopes it becomes
a lot like the radios you started
playing it all the way you say I may
tell you it right I was thinking of a
completely different song that's called
safe and sound cuz you gotta just
started singing it right what I'm
thinking of like like a party safe and
sound
so thinking of like this tailor so so
the dance I was thinking about
oppressing Paul no no like to the
playing in a car and like you have to
get out the car like I will sit and wait
for the song and finish because that's
so good I have this like trap remix of
that Ricky Ricardo song which is the
songs going to link but there's like
this 2 minute just like Larry Maher who
are they and you're driving it's the
best song ever well cats oh my gosh I
love snake thats so much they're so good
or coconut Eminem's do the guys have
coffee crunch I know no I've never liked
coffee crunches I think it's a chocolate
bar and it's like a coffee chocolate ok
and I loved those I thought I was good I
might have to say Almond Joy I love that
okay so I don't let that I love it it's
an almond love almonds coconut obsessive
coconut covered in chocolate says so
much about mouth you're like see that's
the thing I love it because like back in
the day when my friends and I would like
you to serve line up your I know I
wanted them so I good okay give them to
me like I will take them off I mean
I guess I just candy I wish you will get
about cupcakes because I'd rather have
that but if I had to pick like a candy
bar I like mr. Goodbar yeah that's
really good and no one ever gives it out
anymore it's hard to find yeah but I
didn't love that so much favorite so
that is it for our
and so be sure to check out the other
