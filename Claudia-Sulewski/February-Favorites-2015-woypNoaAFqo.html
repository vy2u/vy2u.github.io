in today's video I'm going to be talking
about the things that I loved and
obsessed over in February before we get
started I quickly want to reflect on the
past month February was an amazing month
it's my birthday month I turned 19 years
old on the 19th
so golden birthday I feel like it was a
very busy month but it was also filled
with a lot of memories yeah that's a
good time just the Greek on top before I
get started I don't have very many
beauty products to talk about I feel
like this is becoming a reoccurring
issue in all my favorites videos but I
totally buy you makeup very often so the
favorites that have collected on my bed
are very random but I'm excited to talk
about them so hopefully you guys are
excited to find out what they are so the
first and only Beauty related product is
self-tanner and this is a foaming tanner
so you guys know how much I love st.
Tropez is so great but this month I
decided to try out a different one
because I used to just use the original
one so this is the self tan this is the
wrong bottle okay this is very
embarrassing I got the dark one and
haven't opened it yet I'm planning on
using this a little bit later when I'm
you know tanner so this is my favorite
lately I'll be using these self 10
Express so basically it gives you the
same amount of darkness as the original
one but this one develops a lot quicker
I am definitely gonna start buying this
one from now on because it gives the
same exact look except a lot faster and
I usually apply on self-tanner like the
day of needing it so chiz like that on
my behalf because I really should be
doing it another time but you know
sometimes we forget or always that's me
next up I've gotten one hair product and
this is the L'Oreal no dry it's quick
dry primer spray so you spray this in
your hair before you blow-dry it
obviously and basically what it does is
it protects your hair from the heat and
I
in general just makes my hair feel very
soft and shiny that kind of stuff my
eyes stuck together that was really
weird
this stuff is good I usually don't use a
lot of products in my hair so this is
kind of like a really exciting awesome
thing to be talking about because I
never ever do this ever let's just take
a moment real quick great so that was
pretty much the extent of my normal
favourites that you know you guys would
be expecting to see you know it's just
gonna get really random and strange so
my next favorite is this cap right here
so obviously this is just a mason jar
and this is just clear soap but recently
I was in Michaels buying some fabricant
supplies and I found this little cap
that you can twist on to any mason
company you know cuffs jars whatever
because they all have the same size and
it's so freaking cute because you can
just put anything you want in here
I really like silver things I also we
like clear things it obviously matches
with my room so I've been really really
loving this you can purchase this at any
you know Michael's craft store that's
the only place that I've seen it my next
favorite is also from Michaels and it is
fake flowers I actually have owned Bank
white flowers for a very long time
they're sitting on my desk right now we
should probably just go get them I think
they're so pretty I've had this for
probably over a year now and I just
really liked the look of it it looks
really classy again obviously they don't
die because they're not alive last time
I was in my
I decided I wanted to pick up more
because I love the look of them so I got
these they're obviously a little bit
smaller so you know spicing it up wild
I wanted to bring this up because it's
just a really easy and cheap way to make
and look like you care about nature that
sounded really bad next favorite for the
month of February it would have to be my
floss picks okay so these are why these
are the oral-b
complete floss picks the packaging is
absolutely just adorable that's
definitely what caught me you guys have
never seen floss picks before there
there's little plastic contraptions that
have a string of floss attached and it
makes it really easy to floss your teeth
since I've gotten these I have been
flossing my teeth every single day which
obviously is very healthy for your gums
and keeping your mouth overall healthy
and clean and yeah they're super minty I
love them I only have great things to
say I recommend my next monthly favorite
has to do with cooking so here's where
we transition into the food section of
today's video my first favorite would
have to be this little chopping machine
and I have had this for a while I
actually had this back when I lived in
Chicago and I took it with me because I
knew that I would be using it I'm not
sure if ever talked about it but it is
by the grand oxo and basically you just
put whatever you want in here that you
want to be shot and
so it's cool because it has a squiggly
blade that rotates so it just roughly
chops everything in to be fine and small
pieces I love using this for salads and
something else that I'm about to mention
it's cute it saves you time and it just
makes your life more exciting
so my next food favorites would have to
be crepes I have been making so many
crepes lately it's probably really
unhealthy company I've been eating way
back when I was down here my mom taught
me and really a simple crepe recipe and
recently I remembered about it and I've
kind of been making it like almost every
single day since then you only need
three ingredients one egg sometimes two
depends on the size a cup of flour and a
cup of milk that is it it is so easy to
remember and basically all you do is
just combine all the ingredients
together and you just support onto the
pant and spread it out in a big circle
and there you go you have a crepe I love
adding banana slices and strawberries
into my crepes so that is what I use
this chopper for I love to just throw in
you know a few strawberries chop them up
real good throw them into my crepes
sometimes I add in a little bit of
chocolate hazelnut butter or sprinkle
some powdered sugar my next favorite is
my Christmas present from my family
which I just recently received like
about a week ago that way to go anymore
and that would have to be my Vitamix
blender I have been wanting this blender
for the longest time because it is so
dang good it is so powerful efficient
fast you get that little rod to really
help you you know stir your smoothies or
whatever you're blending it is a really
expensive blender but it is such an
awesome gift guys and I am
happy that I have it in my life we've
been using it like crazy so that would
definitely have to be one of my
favorites for the month of February my
next favorite is a TV show and it would
have to be on tirage I know that I'm
very very late on this but recently
Jonah convinced me to start the season
with him I can't really say that I am
now an entourage expert because I'm only
on season 1 but from what I've seen so
far it is an awesome show and I continue
to think about it every single day and I
want to watch more episodes so that is
what I'm going to be doing all of March
probably won't even take all March
because we will finish them so much
faster than that and that concludes
