video because I got so rambley at one
point I just had enough and deleted all
the footage off my camera here's for
take number two hi everyone today I'm
going to be doing my February favorites
I turned 18 had a fabulous month it was
really great but it went by way too fast
so Eddy okay why am i holding this
anyways we're just gonna get started
with today's video numero uno is my NYX
two-timer eyeliner I've been using this
thing literally every single day this
month unless I didn't wear makeup that
day but it is a double-ended eyeliner
from NYX
so the first side has a skinny felt tip
liner which is my favorite side because
I love using this for my upper lash line
to create a wing and the other side just
has a simple black eyeliner that rolls
up and down I really love this product
it's very pigmented it doesn't smudge it
lasts all day so if you guys are in
search for a new eyeliner I recommend
this one it's great my next favorite is
a concealer and it is the Neutrogena
skin clearing blemish concealer it's
also got micro clear technology in it
it's you guys wondering no but I really
like this concealer I'm in the shade 10
which is light and I just really like
the packaging of it it's very simple to
use I just dot it wherever I need to on
my face which currently is pretty much
my entire face and then just blows it
out with my fingers so I pretty much
take this wherever I go since it is so
easy to like apply on real quick so I've
been really liking it my next of beauty
related favourites is the first aid
beauty skin rescue purifying a mask it
draws out toxins while taking out
impurities and excess oils it leaves
your skin feeling smooth balanced and
clear so all you have to do is just
apply on a very thin amount to your skin
and then you peel it off after 20
minutes and peeling it off is literally
the greatest thing ever it's one of
those things where when you do it you
just feel so content doing it okay I'm
gonna try to think of like a similar
example you know every single time
have like bubble wrap paper and you just
have to pop the bubbles because you just
get excited and it feels good popping
them that's what it feels like peeling
this mask off like when you do it as
you're peeling it you're just like oh
yeah I'm peeling it this is great and
then once it's all gone you're like I
want to keep peeling can I put it on my
whole body please but I really like this
it makes my skin feeling very like clean
and smooth I use it about once a week or
like every other week my next favorite
is a deodorant and this is the secret
clear gel scent expressions durand and
this is in the scent ooh la la lavender
and I wanted to talk about this real
quick because I have always been a user
of like the white solid stick deodorants
so this is the first time I've ever
tried one of the clear gel ones and oh
my god it is so much better than the
white stick ones first starters it
doesn't leave like white marks on any of
your clothes it also dries really fast I
don't know why it took me so long to buy
this but I'm really happy that I did I
regret not buying it earlier because it
is really great my next favorite is also
a product that I regret not buying
earlier and it is the OPI drip dry can
you see it Who am I and what you do with
this magical little bottle is right
after you paint your nails you just
apply on one to two drops on each of
your nails and it instantly dries them
it is so great guys I feel like I've
mentioned this before but I hate
painting my nails so much because I
always seem to mess them up like right
after I paint them so this product just
makes my life a little bit more easier
because it gives it like 60 seconds to
dry and then you can like do things with
your nails so this product is really
nice and I'm really glad that I bought
it because gosh it has definitely made
my life better I'm sorry you guys
notice that I have been flipping my hair
constantly throughout this video I just
don't know what to do with it that's it
we're putting it up I feel like a bunch
of weight has just been lifted from my
shoulders
by the way itself plug if you guys want
to find out how I made this 3 second bun
then it click on the video in the
description or right here maybe I'll put
it here if I'm not too lazy we're
getting off track anyways back to the
favorites video my next favorite is the
tie to go instant stain remover and I
have been using this product for my
blanket it's what Claudia I thought this
was made for clothes yes it is but you
can also use it on your blanket and I
have an all-white blanket so it seems to
always be getting dirty and this product
makes my life a lot easier I don't know
what exactly is making my blanket dirty
because every single day I find new
stains on it that are like pink green
blue purple every single color of the
freaking rainbow and I don't know what
it is but this product right here seems
to always take care of it don't worry
you guys I wash my blanket but it's very
delicate so you're like supposed to get
it dry-cleaned but I don't anyways but
yeah all you do is just take the cap off
and you press down on the pen and as you
press down the product releases from the
tube inside and it magically takes care
of all your stains next up I've got a
little duo as my favorite the first one
is a new favorite tea of mine and this
is the yogi raspberry passion perfect
energy tea and if you guys watch one of
my older favorites videos like during
the fall time I was really really
obsessed with the perfect energy I think
it's called like vanilla spice tea and I
still am but I was talking about how
much energy that tea gives me and how it
just gives me like a really like happy
energetic feeling and I didn't even know
and I didn't even know that they and
oh my god and I didn't even know that
they make these teas and different
flavors so yeah they make the raspberry
passion one and this one tastes really
good it basically just tastes like
raspberry just talk okay if you guys
can't tell I'm on caffeine right now
like I'm so hyper anyways
so I've been drinking this pretty much
every single morning this month and to
go along with this tea I have a
favourite mug of the month and I got
this one from Target it's white I really
like this mug because I find that it is
the perfect size for me I love drinking
like a lot of tea in the morning and I
really hate cups that are wide but
shorts like I like tall skinny ones a
lot more so this one is perfect and it's
so pretty and it also matches with my
room because it's white so that's why I
like it a lot as well I don't know it's
cute though right right or nah you guys
are gonna comment like clutter you're so
weird right now
I'm sorry I apologize the next day right
that I want to show you guys I actually
got this morning technically that I
didn't get this in February but that's
okay we're gonna pretend and it is this
blanket right here which one of my best
friends Adriana we have been best
friends literally since birth oh yeah
she made me this customized like collage
blanket for my 18th birthday and it is
the cutest thing ever I was Tanya I was
like these are the type of things that
you keep until like you're 80 years old
and I just love it so much so it's just
got our entire life on it
so if you're watching this Adriana thank
you I really love it and I really love
you my next favorite is a pair of
glasses that I got from forever 21 and
they look like this if you guys can't
tell these are like the reflective style
glasses so you can't see through them
and they're really cool because they're
black but they've got kind of like a I
can't tell if it's orange or gold but it
has like a Goldy orange look to them I
don't know so I actually bought these
glasses for a look for less show that I
have on awesomeness which I'll talk
about in a second but I got these for an
outfit that I want to recreate of Kylie
Jenner's
and I have actually been wearing these
like crazy ever since then because I
really like them you can't see my eyes
so it makes it all mysterious and stuff
and I just keep them in the car to drive
with them on so I really like them
they're really comfortable and they're
super inexpensive so my next favorite is
my show on awesomeness TV and I'm not
sure if I have announced this on my
channel yet but yes I have my own show
on awesomeness TV which is so much fun
so far two episodes have been posted
live which I will link in the
description box the first and second but
basically it is a look for less show
where I take different celebrities
outfits and recreate them with items
that are a lot lot more inexpensive than
the ones that the celebrities wear but
so far it's been so much fun and any of
you guys that have been watching them so
far seem to really like it and I just
love it so much so I will be linking
that in the downbar also be sure to
subscribe to awesomenesstv oh yeah I am
having so much fun with that show so I
just wanted to let you guys know if you
want to watch it got that yes yes yes oh
my next favorite is an app where's my
iPad found it I'm not too sure if I've
talked about it before I feel like I
have because I've had it for a while I
just recently rediscovered it but it is
called smoothies and it's by the brand
whole living I think that's what it says
on the icon but it looks like this and
basically you can just slide it back and
forth to the different categories and it
basically just gives you a whole bunch
of different smoothie recipes and I am
obsessed with smoothies I drink them
pretty much every single day so this app
is really fun to look there you get a
lot of like different ideas and when you
click on one it just gives you the
ingredients on one side you can click on
the nutrition facts and just how to
create it and stuff and you can favorite
them or go like this it's just a really
nice fancy app for smoothies and I quite
enjoy it my next favorite would have to
be a TV show and this might be kind of
pathetic but I decided to restart the
entire Gossip Girl series this month
for last month technically I forgot how
much I loved the show so when I watched
it a second time okay first off now that
I know who Gossip Girl is I love seeing
all like the sell hints that they drop
it's literally so obvious when you watch
a second time like I don't understand
how I didn't like guessed it already but
it's really fun watching it when you
know who Gossip Girl is and just being
able to relive all the Chuck and Blair
moments I just have so many feelings for
those two human beings and it's a really
great show so if you guys have never
seen Gossip Girl I don't know what
you're doing you need to watch it it's
all on Netflix
my next favorite would have to be the
microphone that I am using right now and
it is the rode shotgun microphone I
actually purchased my first one back in
March and I only used it like a few
times I didn't really know if I liked it
yet and somehow it just miraculously
disappeared and I couldn't find it for
like five months or something like that
but I recently decided to repurchase it
because I looked back on my old videos
where I used the microphone and they
sound so much better
so I repurchased it and I'm so happy
that I did I've been using it in a few
of my like past couple videos and it
seriously just makes such a big
difference everything is so clear and
all the background noise is just muted
out so I really definitely recommend
getting a microphone for those of you
who want to like up up your game with
the whole quality of your audio and
lastly I wanted to share my music
favorites because you guys always ask me
to do it let's see what I have I've been
loving this fun
I've been liking really weird music this
month I'm just gonna warn you guys my
first favorite is on the weirder side
but I'm really really obsessed with it
especially the beginning of the song it
just sounds so cool and different I've
never heard a song that sounds anything
like this song so I definitely want to
share it with you guys but it is called
saga by Basement Jaxx yeah
yeah so I've really been liking that
song because it's very different and
just it's exciting um I don't I haven't
really prepared for this so I'm just
looking through but I really like got
your number by nadya oh so I've been
really liking that one it just has a
very like catwalk vibe to it you know
what I'm talking about I like sour
cherry by The Kills yeah so I mean I've
really just been liking like the Gossip
Girl soundtrack ooh
hold up earthquake by Lebrun I heard
this song on the radio one time and I
just I liked it for some reason so I've
been liking this song
let me just spectra
so yeah that has been a very fun pumpup
song to listen to so that is it for
today's video I hope you guys enjoyed it
be sure to check out my new look for
Less show on awesomeness TV which I will
link down there as well as my newest
video I worked really hard on it so I'll
see you guys for a new video very soon
