entire video but when I looked back at
it it was like 23 minutes long and that
was just way too long I was just talking
way too much so that's why i decided
that i'm just going to rerecord it right
now because it was just editing would
have been a total pain so today i'm
going to be doing my februari favorites
and this was my birthday mom so of
course I had a lot of fun and I'm
officially 16 which is so crazy so that
is all that I had to say and now we're
just going to get right into my
favorites so first I'm just going to
start out with face products I've been
loving the mac mineralized skin finish
natural myosin medium plus which is the
perfect color for me and I've been using
this like crazy it's like starting to
get flat now as you can see lately my
skin has been very good to me so this is
all I need to wear when it comes to
foundation so I haven't been wearing any
liquid foundation lately all i've been
wearing is this and this gives the
perfect amount of coverage for me i've
been wearing this like everyday and then
also i've been really loving this mac
beauty powder from the Vera collection I
think you can still buy this I'm pretty
sure yeah but it looks like this and
it's called Sunday afternoon where I
like to do is these two um like pink
colors I use as a blush and then
underneath they have this shimmery kind
of very light pink color and I use that
as a highlight so I love how this is
kind of all together so you can use the
blush and the highlight and you know
it's just all in one little compact
product so I like that a lot I've been
using this a lot lately and it's it's so
pretty i love the color my next favorite
is a brush and this is the Sedona lace I
think it's called tulip brush but it's F
it's the FBO 3 brush and there's hair
stuck on it cute okay oh my god this son
just got really bright but what does the
son of us do that like goes dark and
then it goes like anyways but I've been
loving this brush for highlighting my
face I am just in love with highlight my
face like it's just I do it every day
and this is a great brush for it just
because the pointed tip is perfect to
you know get it into the product and
then just
bit across your cheek bones and your
nose and wherever else you like tile
your face so I've just been loving this
and this brush is from the vortex
collection which I will be doing a
review on the collection very soon and
this was my favorite out of all the
brushes so I decided to include in this
video next I've just got to I makeup
products and they're both eyeliners the
first one is the sheer cover gel
eyeliner and this is in cafe mocha it
just looks like this and I love it
because I don't have very many brown eye
liners and I really really like the look
of broad eyeliners it looks a little
more natural and not as you know like
will they are my guess and I've been
loving this color and super creamy I
would swatch it but it's eyeliner and it
would just get all over the place but
it's very nice it stays on all day and I
think it's very small and cute so my
next favorite eyeliner is the Urban
Decay 24-7 glide on eye pencil and this
isn't perversion I got this in like a
pack of four other eyeliners so I don't
think you can buy this individually
because I never see it anywhere which
makes me really upset because I love
this eyeliner so much I already swatched
it because this is the second time i'm
recording this video but it's just your
perfect really really pigmented matte
black color my next to favorites are
both lip products so the first one is
the lush bubble gum lip scrub I'm pretty
sure everyone has like raved about this
and I'm just really late on it but it
looks like that and I just drop some but
I love the smell of it I love the taste
of it and I just love it i've been using
it everyday it makes your lips very soft
and nice feeling not chapped or anything
but the next lip products that i've been
loving is the mac tender tone in a
purring why am i show you guys the top
but it looks like this when you open it
and i got this from one of my friends
for my birthday and this color is
perfect for the spring and summer
because it's your perfect kind of neon
orange it's more neon than it looks in
the camera but it's like a neon peachy
orange and it looks so pretty when you
put it over like new lipstick or just
your natural lips and it smells really
really good and yeah I just love that my
next favorite product is a soap from
lush and
it is the soap in sexy peel and it looks
like this and we just drop the paper but
it looks like this here's a little
pieces that I haven't used yet oh my god
I keep dropping stuff but I've lost this
smell of this it smells exactly like
lemon starburst um and oh my god i have
like hair remember uh-huh it's so strong
and it's so like citrusy smelling that
it like wakes you up and it makes you
feel really clean and refreshed and
that's why i love it it just really
wakes me up in the morning it smells so
good I cannot describe how good the
smells and it's just it's perfect for me
so yeah my next product is a hair
product and this is the derm organic
leavin shine therapy I got this at an
event in new york and i think january
but i've been loving this a lot it's
just basically a leave in spray to give
your hair some shine and it really does
make your hair shy like it makes your
hair look beautiful um definitely don't
recommend like spraying it up here
because it'll make your hair look really
greasy but i've been loving just spring
this on the ends of my hair because
obviously my hair goes through a lot of
hair coloring and my hair is very dead
at the bottom so this helps kind of give
my hair and more shiny healthy look to
it so that's why i've been liking this i
just spray it really quickly on my ends
and i'm good to go so that's been really
nice for my hair so that is it for all
my makeup and kind of hair products now
i'm just going to get onto more fashion
and food and random stuff like that so
first of all for fashion i've been
loving bandos and i haven't really had
the chance to wear like any of them yet
just because it's still cold outside but
I've been buying them lately because I'm
just getting ready for the warm weather
and especially summer so these I've been
really liking I haven't had a chance to
wear them of course um but these are
from urban outfitters they're just laced
bandos so pretty and i think i'm just so
excited to start wearing them and then
also i have these kind of stretchy
bandos as well these are super neon and
you guys are probably
me and claudia when would you ever wear
those they don't look for any on camera
but in real life they're like what BAM
highlighter and I actually wore these
for my birthday party because my
birthday party was like a black light
party I just got a white shirt from
michaels and I wrote bday girl and it's
a a muscle tee so basically it's just
cut out on the side like that and I
would show you guys the back but it says
a bunch of stuff on it because people
were writing on my shirt with
highlighters because it like load in the
black light and I have like some last
names on here so that's what I'm not
going to show you but nobody signed it
on the front there's just random spots
on it but yeah I just wore this and this
underneath and I just swore like black
leggings and like tall heights high
socks with like neon stripes and it
looked so sick I it was so awesome but
yeah so those are those and then also
another favorite of mine were these
boots I've been loving shoes lately I
really really like my sperrys and Thomas
but I feel like you guys already saw
them in my most recent haul so that's
why I decided to show you guys these
because you haven't seen them yet but I
got these shoes pretty recently from
nordstrom rack and they look like this
wait for it these were $25 when I saw
that I was like what $25 they're from
the brand Robert and so originally I
think they're like 60 bucks but they
were priced down to 25 and it just has
brown mother right here obviously it's
fake and then it has like what would you
consider this I kind of sweater II um
knit material right here yeah so it
looks like that and then there's little
buckle and I love these I think they're
so cute I've just been obsessed with
these I love them yeah and then my other
favorite is kind of weird but I love
wearing a baggy sweatpants you know like
the boyfriend style pants um I'm
actually wearing my favorites right now
they're just black and normal they just
have strings and they have pockets but I
mainly just want to talk about wearing
got these from because originally I
to get all of my sub hands from
Victoria's Secret okay I love our yoga
pants but their sweat pants are really
really bad quality compared to the ones
that I'm wearing right now so for
example let me show you these I got
these from a trade secret they were like
fifty dollars okay so thin not not very
warm and then on the bottom as you can
see they don't stitch it right here to
like seal it off or anything you just
kind of leave it cut and after a while
it just doesn't look very new and it
doesn't really look very good either and
these are so expensive and the pins down
that I'm wearing right now and actually
guy pants and they're from champs and I
don't know if you guys have that where
you live but um chance is basically like
a okay it's basically like an athletic
store for like guy clothing so these are
guy pants and I would show you them but
they have like a team on the bottom so
that's so I'm not going to show you them
but the bottoms are like really nice
because they're all stitched and they're
very very comfortable and thick they
have really nice pockets they're cozy
and warm and they're just so much more
better quality than like victoria secret
um definitely check them out I'm a size
small and you can just get like your
state's team or whatever but yeah I've
been loving those and then my other
favorites these are kind of random but
I've been oh I got makeup on it so I've
been loving animal phone cases i know
i'm just so childish but i have three of
them right now and you look like this
I've gone owl which is on my phone right
now a turtle and a penguin and I got
these from ebay for like four dollars
five dollars super inexpensive but I've
been loving them so they're just silicon
and they're just they're so cute so I
like that just like to put it in today's
video and then for music my favorite
song has been a call me maybe I love the
music video that justin bieber and
selena gomez and ashley tisdale all did
and then whoever else was in the video i
don't really know anyone else but they
made a music video to call me maybe and
it was like the cutest thing ever so
I've just been loving that song I'm
I get on repeat like every single days
and like doing my makeup as I'm cleaning
my room like I love that song so my next
favorites are food favorites and the
first one our apples and peanut butter
together they're like the perfect snack
for just after school or if like you're
not doing anything and it's also super
healthy which is really great and me and
beauty baby 44 we're like obsessing
about them over Twitter we're just like
tweeting each other about it but they're
really good so shout-out to her um and
also I have like this little cutting
thing for apples and you like push down
on it makes like the perfect little
slices I just I love it I'm gonna go so
i'll talk to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
