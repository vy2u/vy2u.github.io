sparkly Barbie XO and I decided to come
together and compete for a first
impressions contest it's just going to
be a friendly little competition between
the three of us
comparing on how we apply the balletto
HD airbrush makeup system for the first
time so I did want to think balletto for
providing these airbrush systems for us
as well as helping us make this happen
so I applied this on for the first time
yesterday morning and of course I filmed
myself doing it so if you guys would
like to see how I use this airbrush
system for the first time just keep on
watching hopefully you guys will find it
somewhat entertaining amusing it's my
first time okay just been watching
absolutely no makeup on right now all I
did was wash my face and a plant a
moisturizer so let's just get started so
first off you get a CD and some
instructions which I briefly skimmed
through so that I somewhat knew what I
was doing this is my first time trying
out like an airbrush system so I'm very
excited to see how this turns out it
might be a complete fail or it might
turn out really good I also got a bunch
of different colors to try out you know
to see which one's like match my skin
and stuff I've got those and of course
we've got the machine itself which comes
in this box too dude
I almost dropped it that would have not
been good so when you open it up it
looks like this machine itself is
actually a lot smaller than I thought it
would be so I like that the airbrush
holder sticks on the side like that so
that you can just place it in so that
goes in right here
oh it's fun
hello oh my god I was not expecting that
okay as you can see here there's an on
button and then you can choose the
different modes so there's low medium
and high this is high low medium they
can turn off I've got a bunch of
different colors to choose from so I'm
going to take the lightest one I have
which is latte and we're gonna attempt
to conceal my under eye circles
alright we're doing this okay you also
want to shake up the makeup got that
rhymes before you use it so I'm gonna
put in two drops of latte this is so
cool okay so we're gonna put on low I'm
trying to get like just a red area right
here oh my god it's like cold it feels
so you can see it's like covering up
this is so cool
I'm like seriously amazed right now
so when it sprays on your face it feels
very like cool and refreshing why is it
taking me this long to try this like I
am loving this I'm gonna try Sienna
watch it you just watch it be really
dark
oh my lord may need to practice a little
bit okay it seriously Claudia judging by
the looks of my neck I don't think I'm
gonna win this competition I'm having so
much fun right now
I'm gonna go in with a little bit more
of Lotte and just kind of like I don't
even know I probably don't need anymore
but it's just so fun I want to keep
doing it
so I'm officially done with the
foundation part and personally I am very
happy with how it turns out I may have
gone a little bit too dark but it's
overall I think it looks really good it
covered up all of my like imperfections
I had a few right here and on my cheeks
and stuff so a plus for that next up
we're doing a blush which I'm kind of
terrified I feel like it's either gonna
make it or break it I don't know we'll
see but one of the things that I wanted
to mention is when I first applied the
makeup and let it dry which I mean it
ends up drying like five seconds but I
noticed right away that leaves your skin
feeling a very soft and almost like a
powder finish which I like because like
normally foundations make your skin feel
very you know like dewy and kind of like
almost sticky in a way so you have to
set it with powder and I noticed right
away that you don't have to set this
with powder coz it already feels like
soft and stuff so it just feels so soft
and I touch my face but now I'm going to
do the blush I'm kind of scared to do it
for blush we do it on the medium setting
and I'm taking the shade antique rose so
I'm just gonna put in like two drops of
this I'm really nervous for this okay
what is this
Oh God Oh God no I messed up I dunno see
I knew this is gonna happen guys
all right this cheek this cheek turned
out pretty good though look at that
we're going to try this cheek one more
time okay I'm just going to be done with
the blush so now I'm going to attempt to
do my eyeshadow with a darker shade so
I'm going to be using nutmeg oh gosh
wish me luck
so this is what my eyeshadow turned out
like and I honestly think I did pretty
good just like a nice little bronze in
the crease overall it was very very fun
to use it was the foundation and could
see they were very easy the blush need
to work a bit and also the eyeshadow
wasn't that bad as well I really just
want to wipe off all my makeup and just
do it again because it was that fun but
let me know how you guys think I did in
the comments below I think I did a
pretty good job for my first time
besides this cheek right here it's a
little messed up that's why I'm covering
it with my hair after importing that
footage onto my computer I realized what
an actual poor job I did but I must say
that it is very easy to get the hang of
because I did use it today for my
foundation and it was a lot easier so if
you suck as badly as I did for the first
time don't worry have hope because it
gets easier so that is how I applied the
balletto HD airbrush makeup system I
really really do like this stuff if you
guys would like to try out this airbrush
system then I will have their links in
the downbar and I just think it's a very
fun product it's very different from
just applying on foundation and I also
like this because it's very clean and
sanitary so if you apply makeup on to
others then it's just really easy
because the product never touches your
face you're just spraying it on so I
think it's great for any special
occasions like parties and I don't know
events weddings all that stuff so I just
think it's very very fun and just the
fact that you can buy different shades
and then kind of mix your own shade and
stuff like that so yeah I'll have their
link in a Darbar if you guys like to try
it out and I will also have the links to
the other girls videos so I'll have that
down there and I'm actually very curious
as to see how they did their first time
I don't know if it's possible to do any
worse than I did but I guess you'll see
it so make sure
comment down below and tell me how you
guys think I did also if any of you guys
end up trying out the balletto airbrush
system then definitely leave a video
response down below try it for your
first time because I would love to watch
your guys's first impressions and stuff
so that is it for today's video make
sure to check out the other girls videos
down below and I love to talk to you
guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
