talking about my workout routine and I
get questions all the time on how I stay
in shape and how I stay healthy and
active and all that stuff so today I'm
finally doing the video and I'm really
excited to do this video actually so
let's just get right into it
I have four different sources of
exercising so I'm just gonna go through
them right now real quickly
the first one is tennis the second one
is yoga the third one is running out
like outside during my free time
the last one is workouts in my room so
let's go back to the first one so yeah
my first source of exercising is tennis
and during the tennis season which was
like the beginning of the school year it
lasted for like a month and a half I'm
not really sure but back when the tennis
season was still going on
I had tennis every single day for like I
think he was like two hours or two and a
half or something so that's all I did
because it took every single day and
sometimes on the weekends so that was
like my source of exercising so once the
tennis season ended I wanted to make
sure that I kept you know staying active
and working out every single day so
basically now that the season is over
I still do tennis practice every
Thursday are you tennis for one hour so
I just do tennis once a week and that's
just gonna help me you know maintain my
tennis skills um so yeah now getting
into what I do nowadays once the season
is over so on Thursdays I have tennis
practice for one hour and that's usually
it for the day that's like my only
workout for Thursday's that I also
decided to start doing yoga which leads
me to my second source of exercising and
my friend Kate actually encouraged me to
start doing yoga and I don't just like
do it in my room or anything I actually
go to a yoga studio like I have a
membership there it's really close by my
house and I do that twice a week I went
the like when I first started doing yoga
I was obsessed with it I would literally
do it like every single day but or not
like every other day but it is pretty
expensive and pricey so that's why I
only do it twice a week now
I do it on Mondays and Wednesdays and a
my yoga studio there's a bunch of
different classes you can do there's
like yoga sculpt hot yoga like core
power and what else is there like core
power restore like handle it I don't
know there's like a bunch of different
classes you can take and my favorite is
yoga sculpt because it is the best
workout ever I promise you guys like if
you ever try a yoga sculpt class you
will have never sweat that much before
in your entire life we use weight so
you're like working your muscles and
there's a bunch of squats and push-ups
and there's some cardio as well and they
play awesome music and it's just great
so I'm obsessed with yoga so yes I do
yoga on Mondays and Wednesdays and then
on Thursdays I have tennis practice also
I will be doing a what's in my yoga bag
slash workout bag video very soon
because I got this like MooMoo lemon
workout bag and I'm obsessed with it so
I'll definitely be doing a what's in my
yoga bag video very soon so onto my
third source of exercising and that
would have to be just running outside
during my free time so usually I will do
this on Tuesdays because I don't do
anything on Tuesdays and then on Fridays
I'll do it a little bit after school and
then sometimes on the weekends but a lot
of the times I just take the weekends
off because you know I'm like hanging
out with friends and stuff but I try to
do it on like Tuesdays Fridays and like
Sundays so when it comes to going
outside and working out alone I'm not
really too strict or crazy about
anything I don't have to run for a
certain amount of time or distance or
anything but I do run like year-round so
even if it's cold outside just throw on
a jacket and like some yoga pants and
you'll be good and it always changes up
so for example if I'm feeling really
lazy one day I'll just go out for a walk
for like 25 minutes or sometimes I'm
feeling really good so I'll like go for
a run or a jog and I also asked my mom
to do it with me all the time like I
actually went for a walk slash jog with
my mom and yeah we're doing like cute
little like skips and walking backwards
to work our butts
butt kicks and high knees and all that
stuff so I'm always switching it up on
my walks slash run slash jogs I don't
know it's always different every single
time but all I do is just throw my
sneakers and I just run through the
blocks around my neighborhood and I
really love it because it's a great way
to like relieve stress and kind of get
your mind off of things if you're
feeling really angry or sad or I don't
know whatever so onto my last source of
exercising and that would have to be
many little workouts in my room I do
these whenever I feel like it so I don't
really have any schedule when it comes
to this but I try to do it like every
single night I pretty much do do it like
every single day but you know I always
forget sometimes and what I do is I just
lay out my yoga mat on my floor in my
room
you know just do crunches and push-ups
and like leg lifts and all that stuff
planks whatever sometimes I like repeat
some of this stuff that I learned in
yoga so that also changes up all the
time I'll do like different types of
crunches like I'll lift my legs up and
raise them and then lower them and raise
them or I'll do like backwards crunches
or what else do I do I'll do like
jumping jacks I don't know I just do a
bunch of different little like workouts
and stuff so that is everything that I
do to stay in shape and you know stay
active and lately I've been loving what
I'm doing it's never a pain to go to
yoga because I'm obsessed with yoga so
much so that's like the main reason I
want to do this video is to introduce
you guys to yoga if you've never tried
it because it literally it's just it's
so much fun it doesn't even feel like a
workout but when you like leave the
class you just feel so good because your
whole body is like dripping sweat and it
just it feels so good so that is it for
my workout routine that is ever
that I do and I'm sorry my phone keeps
going off but I'm yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed today's video I would like to
know what you guys do to stay active and
stuff like that so leave that in the
downbar and for any of you yoga lovers
out there you know we can talk about our
love for yoga because it's the best and
that's it so I hope you guys enjoyed
today's video also I have one more quick
question I actually bought a mini fridge
for my room a couple weeks ago so it's
down there you can see and I was
wondering if you guys would want me to
do like a what's in my mini fridge type
of video and in that video I kind of
talked about why I got it and stuff like
that so if that sounds interesting at
all then leave it down below if you guys
want to see that okay
