today's get ready with me video is
sponsored by Universal because they
actually invited me to attend a
masquerade ball and screening of the new
fifty shades darker movie and I'm so so
excited the first one's incredible if
you guys haven't seen the trailer for it
you need to go watch it the movie is
coming out in theatres February 10th
sense it is a masquerade ball I wanted
my makeup to be inspired by the masks
that Anastasia wore in the movie this is
what it looks like it's very silvery and
whimsical you'll see how I pull the
silver into my eyeshadow but also kept
it dark yeah keep on watching if you
want to find out how I could this makeup
look as well as my loose curls and then
afterwards I am bringing you guys along
for the night to show you guys what goes
down as well as should you guys be
completed luck with my outfit and
everything so let's get into it starting
off with foundation you guys already
know my favorite I like to use the Make
Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation and
right now I am mixing the shades 120 and
125 so I'm just going in with a
foundation brush and then blending
everything in with my Real Techniques
Diamond sponge I'm using my benefit play
sticks for contouring and a little bit
of concealing so right now I'm using the
shade spin-the-bottle and applying it
underneath my eyes blending that in with
my ring finger to warm up the product
and then afterwards I'm grabbing the
shade jumprope and I'm going to go in
and contour my face and blend that out
with a sponge so I like to target
underneath my pretty much non-existent
cheekbone flesh nobody has to know and
then also on to my temples and forehead
I kind of have a large forehead so I
like to you know mcdowell volkmar to set
my face I'm using my one and only true
love Laura Mercier translucent powder so
I'm going underneath my contour and just
quickly setting that and then also I
never really show this set to you guys
but every single time I use a face brush
and I make a brush I
always always spray it with some
antibacterial makeup brush cleanser and
kind of wipe it on a towel and then yeah
I'm blending all of the powder into my
face now time for the eyes I like to
start off with my eyebrows to help frame
my face and give me some direction when
applying on eyeshadow so you guys
already know what I do I use powder
products and now going in with this
smaller palette I'm using this light
taupey brown and throwing it into my
crease as a transition color it will
help to keep everything very gradual and
blended so not going too crazy with that
but just throwing that in there
literally throwing the eyes now I'm not
throwing anything onto my face that I'm
using this last palette and grabbing a
darker grey that's Matt I am doing why
do I keep seeing were throwing like it's
so aggressive I'm definitely just
packing that's it the shadow into my
crease and kind of on the outer half of
my eyes and blending it in a ton we want
this to be gradual and well blended in
and then grabbing a slightly darker
shadow that has a little bit of shimmer
into it I'm just placing that I'm using
different vocabulary onto the second
half of my eyelids and blending that as
well
and then grabbing a smaller brush I am
starting to drag out the same exact
shadow into a slight wing I've been
really obsessed with making wings out of
eyeshadow I think it's super soft and
easier to handle and then to balance
everything out so I'm grabbing that same
shadow and applying it to my lower lash
line wow that was the longest voiceover
in my entire life oh my god and we're
still going and afterwards I'm taking a
silver eyeshadow and packing it on to
the inner half of my lids and this is
where I kind of pulled inspiration from
the masks because I wanted to add silver
in some also throwing that into the
inner tear ducts of my eyes I am
definitely going all out and wearing
some fake eyelashes tonight but in
preparation of that I still like to curl
my eyelashes and apply mascara because
otherwise you can kind of
the separation between your real and
fake lashes so wow that mascara is
drying I am quickly skipping over to the
bronzing part of my eye makeup tutorial
so I'm just quickly contouring
everything and now I'm moving on to the
fake eyelashes I really like the natural
ones from ardell so I just applied them
with a tweezer and it's not the easiest
thing for me to do you can see me
struggling but eventually we got there
for blush I'm using my Maybelline master
highlight
highlighting blush in the shade and nude
and then to actually highlight my face
I'm using this pro light fusion powder
and it's for makeup forever it's very
glowy very pretty I'm being very boring
and very unoriginal with my lip color
you guys know how much I love lip
products that basically look like the
actual shade of my lips but a little bit
better one of those you know so yeah
this liquid lipstick is amazing and I'm
obsessed with it I'll have all the
product links in the description box as
well so if you're interested in anything
but that is everything for the makeup so
now moving on to the hair and
fortunately I actually had second date
curls in so all I did was brush out my
hair to get out any tangles and then I
went in with the same hair curler that I
used the other night basically starting
halfway curling up and then dragging in
more just because I have longer hair so
it's a little more effective for me it's
also very satisfying and fun to do and
as you can see I kind of switch off
between going outwards and inwards this
helps to really keep all your curls
seperated sometimes they all kind of
become one and then it doesn't really
you know look how you want it to and
then as hairspray I'm using this
texturizing spray from or BAE it's
amazing it smells so good it's so light
and as you can see it just as immediate
texture into your hair but keeping it
very airy and breezy
but I'm finished with my makeup and hair
it's time to go to my outfit I'm not
going to imagine coming up there so
let's go to the ball and screening and
review the final look we are quickly

shades darker my son alone so what's
going to you guys I just got off the
