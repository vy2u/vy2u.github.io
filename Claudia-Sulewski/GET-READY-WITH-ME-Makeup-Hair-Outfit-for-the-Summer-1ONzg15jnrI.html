channel today we're doing a summertime
get ready with me we're talking all the
steps the night before how I get my legs
to be smooth and silky for the
summertime as well as my makeup how I do
my hair now that it's a lot shorter than
it used to be as well as a little fun
summer outfit that I would just throw on
if you liked this video and if you are
excited for summer be sure to give it a
thumbs up and if you need my channel
then be sure to subscribe and join the
family and hit that bow notification so
that you know when I upload videos
without further ado let's get into the
videos we're gonna jump back to the
night before so that I can show you guys
what I do to get super smooth and silky
skin that lasts up to four weeks because
we don't want to deal with prickly likes
you know we're trying to show them off
today I am working with broad you guys
know how much I love their products
we've built such a wonderful partnership
for the past year and tonight I'm using
the braun silk-épil 7 which is
waterproof and that is why I'm drawing a
bath because why not do this in the bath
you know what I mean this epilator has
40 tweezer Close Grip technology so you
can remove hair that is as small as a
grain of sand it follows the contour of
your body it with the pivoting head it
also stimulates and massages your skin
as you go depending on your preference
you can up elite shave or trim by just
switching the attachments it comes with
or my favorites the bikini trimmer
that's super easy and safe to use around
sensitive areas if you guys want to try
it for yourselves you can purchase on
Amazon or just click the link in my bio
I will have everything down there
let's move on to the makeup so after I
put on some chapstick I like to put on a
little bit of primer for my foundation
this is the Laura Mercier SPF 30 primer
so it's gonna help me to protect my skin
from the Sun for foundation I'm using
two different types of products for
coverage as well as a liquid
highlighters so for starters Make Up For
Ever Ultra HD of course and I've been
loving the glossy a perfecting skin tint
I use the shade medium and then that
third product is the Marc Jacobs fantasy
dewdrops liquid highlighter so that's
going to help to make my face look a
very glowy and dewy and youthful and I
love mixing it into my foundation for
concealer I'm using the Laura Mercier
flawless fusion ultra long wear
concealer I'm in the shade 2w and I'm
applying it to my highlighting points as
well as under my eyes and then I also
took a darker shade and use that as a
cream contour I love using like darker
concealers and I'm using the same
concealer but in the shade 5n
I honestly talk about this so much and I
always use it but it's the glossy a
cloud paint in the shade dusk and I'm
just tapping it onto the apples of my
cheeks as my blush using liquid or cream
blush products really help the color to
melt into your skin and look super
flushed and natural then of course I
have to set my face so I'm just using a
translucent powder and brushing that all
over with a big powder brush
next stop you got to fill in at the
eyebrows I'm using my benefit brow
Zing's palette and today I decided to
use the powder you guys know how to do
this
just use light strokes and a light hand
and eventually just get the shape that
you want
I don't know this literally takes me
forever so like when I finish my brows
I'm celebrating because I hate it
today's eye look is going to be a very
very warm
the first palette I'm using is the Urban
Decay Naked petit heat palette and I'm
grabbing that super bright orange in the
middle and applying it into my crease
and really dragging it out to just warm
up the whole area and then also putting
that same color onto my lower lash line
jumping over to a different palette I'm
using kind of a darker burnt pink shade
and applying that all over my lids and
then going in with kind of like a light
pale pink and tapping that right in the
center to brighten up the eyes and blend
everything out and the last color that
I'm using in my eyes is this really
really pretty like going to orange
glittery color and really happy putting
that on my heavily putting that on my
lower lash line as well as my upper lash
line and just making sure everything is
blended out and then of course you gotta
finish off your eyes by curling lashes
and applying on some mascara I'm using
my milk makeup mascara and I love it
also I'm such a liar because we're not
done I forgot to highlight my brow bone
so I'm just using a very pale pink and
placing that there as well as a little
bit in the inner corners of my eyes for
highlighter I wanted to test out a new
product newer for me at least I usually
gravitate towards kind of gold in the
highlighters I love when they have that
gold shimmer and this one is gorgeous it
is the addiction face illuminator and
while putting my highlighter on I
realized oh my god Claudia you forgot a
step how dare you I forgot powdered
bronzer you guys I'm such a mess today
so we're just gonna pretend that didn't
happen and go back in and
a little bit of powdered bronzer it's
fine it's all gonna be fine and yeah I
like to like do like a double contour
because I did have the cream contour
earlier but I feel like the powder just
really warms up the face and then of
course gotta put on some lipstick I'm
using this Anasazi lipstick in a shade
Hollywood I think it's so so pretty and
peachy and it matches the eyes perfectly
to finish everything off I'm using my
Urban Decay setting spray and I'm sure
wrench my face in it I coat it fully and
that is the eye makeup look so now
moving on to the hair it is so simple
and easy
Wow I love having short hair so I'm just
starting off by giving myself kind of a
loose messy middle part I don't care
that much to give my roots a little bit
texture I'm using my living proof dry
shampoo spraying that in kind of shaking
it out with my finger to make sure you
don't see any of that residue or powder
and then what I'm doing is super super
simple I'm taking a straightener and I'm
basically just curling the bottom like
third of my hair and flipping it up so
that the ends of my hair just has a
little more of like a polish flicked up
look and I kind of love how like
innocent it makes my hair look and yeah
I have pretty straight hair so I don't
have to go all the way down and I mean
that's really it and then just finishing
it off with a little bit of weight
texturizing spray and just kind of
shaking that through to make sure that
the little curled ends stay throughout
the day that rhymed and that is all that
I did to my hair just kind of play her
down with it
we're done cool great moving on
last but not least we have the outfits
and this one is super super casual but I
thought it'd be kind of a great
representation of like what I would be
wearing running around in the summertime
because we all run around in the
summertime Joey
but um yeah I've got these like fun
little vintage shorts from Reformation a
good graphic tee I love some good kind
of funky gold necklaces and then of
course got to finish the look off with
some converse I've been loving the
platform converse they're just so fun
little belt you're good to go we're done
thank you so much for watching today's
video I hope you guys enjoyed it and I
will see you next week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
