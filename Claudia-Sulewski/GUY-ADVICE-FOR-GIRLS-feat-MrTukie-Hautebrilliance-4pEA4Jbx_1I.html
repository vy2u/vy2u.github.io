hot brilliancy on YouTube and Hudson mr2
key today we are going to be doing a guy
advice for girls video so me and Aspen
are gonna be taking turns asking cut
some questions and get to hear his
opinions alright so I'm going to start
off with the first question
so Hudson would you rather why would you
rather have a girl make the first move
like kissing wise or do you think it's
the guys it's always the guys like oh
yeah job to do it my answer is that all
the time I think the guy should be doing
it for the most part but every once in a
while it's like cute if a girl kind of
kisses a guy alright if you're dating
like if you have I got like that thing
with the girl then I mean the guy should
probably be making the move but like if
you're dating it's like cute if you're
like doing something and then the girl
just like this is you yeah I think like
the initial first kiss obviously the
first time the guy's gotta make the move
I mean it depends what the relationship
is that like if you have a good
relationship it's probably like a good
idea to kiss a guy every now and then so
they feel loved yeah yeah my first
question
do you like when a girl texts you first
or do you think the guys at experts well
it depends like if you don't like a girl
and she texts you first thing that's
annoying because you don't want to text
you but then it's like you really like a
girl it's like nice to wake up and then
be like hey it just shows that they want
to talk to you cuz sometimes guys
especially because girls don't ever show
their feelings
they're like unsure of how you feel so
if you text them first that's kind of
like a alright I think she's at least
interested in me because she's texting
me first unless it's like a pity text
but would you rather just stay home and
like watch a movie on the couch or
something and do something very chill or
do you like to actually like go out to
movies and stuff I think personally I
just like to be home it's like a comfort
zone for me you know what I mean yeah
like I don't like going out I just
thought it'd be more fun to be like in
your room that's
it's awkward moon in the movie theater
it's like and it's like more like
personal I feel like yeah it's like an
open letter and like hit like be
yourselves like if you want to talk
during the movie you can you're not like
force with me yeah like you can you have
more freedom to do whatever you want you
could be watching we're gonna be okay
well let's go look at something on the
computer
yeah but if your makeup for my stepping
question how do you feel about when a
girl like tweets about you or stuffed
with you know it is this negative or
positive or both either way do you like
tweet about you in general like if you
like everything like is it like ah this
guy's such a dick or is it like oh this
guy's steamy well you could be like yeah
I think it's weird I don't know I just
feel like some tweets are just pointless
like you don't have to share that with
anyone
I've ranted about this in a video before
I just don't like selfies and no one
knows who you're talking about and it
just makes things complicated
crush on you you think she's talking
about him and then he asks you know home
come here so thing and then it's awkward
you like talking about and then you're
just like well that's what food was
about me
oops you know it's on subtweet do you
like it when girls like play around and
tease you hit you I'm sore oh no I don't
like it I mean not like how would you
like if a guy like a playful like like
Oh game is like you're like like you do
like a flirty thing and then they're
like oh she's touching me this is
awesome but then it or it's like what
the hell is still touching me don't hit
a Hudson you want just don't like when
people touch me so it's like when you
hit me makes me really uncomfortable
just why I'm like not crazy about this
setup
see there's nowhere to go for my
question what is the right like time or
when you start like giving presents well
first of all you have to be dating and I
would say around like after six months
like it's your birthday or Christmas
I'll go with asking things like if you
if you ask a girl other than a month
later it's their birthday things have to
get her a good but if you ask a girl out
and there's no like significant event
yeah for the next like six months like
don't be like hey we last four months
here's a necklace like you just just
wait do you like it when girls like
dress up and like wear makeup and like
want to look good in front of you or
like do you still like it when like
girls can just like we're literally
Nicole through look homeless and like
hang out with you if you like used to
seeing a girl all the time and you guys
like car if you have a like so dress up
and then you're like hanging out and
then she not wearing makeup and you're
like sorry I guess a modest amount of
makeup is always the best way to go
because guys don't really like that
surprise factor of like whoa let's go
extremely different without makeup if
you're going out like it's alright to
get like put some makeup on and wear a
nice outfit for like I don't think you
have to dress to the nines if you're
gonna hang out some cows likey I just
like to wear comfy clothes it's like all
about confidence if they feel confident
then they'll kind of like rub off yeah
but like if you like someone you're not
gonna be like oh yeah if she didn't make
an exam like dawn get out of my house
you'll be like our date like this is Jo
yeah why would you like how would you go
about meeting their family and
anytime I've ever taken a girl home
whenever I like I'm interested in a girl
I always take them home like the first
time we were hanging out and they always
meet my family and that's just cause
like a close family but like I'm always
really nervous to meet their family you
have to be still intimidating because
especially since I'm a guy and it's
everyone it's like the dads like little
girl you know like you don't to be like
yeah you know like it's like a big deal
to me parents anymore I don't think it's
so casual I mean it's like one thing if
you're like hey like let's go out to
like a dinner with my family that sound
like much but like just to like bring
them like you're gonna go hang out on
your room and you just like walking
you're like the family room like hey
this is like Claudia and welcome yeah
then you say hey and then you go up to
your room and then you phone videos in
your room yeah or you car phone videos
okay okay my question is how do you feel
about like once you have a girlfriend do
you think it's important to be like good
friends with her friends like do you
like hair to like be friends with her
friends are like no opposite to her
being friends with your friends you have
to have like a good balance like what
like especially like if you have a
friend that like starts dating girl then
you never see them again it's really
annoying have you ever had that yeah
I've had plenty of friends like that so
like if I were to ever date a girl I
would make sure that like I'm at least
like friendly with her friend glue glue
and like she's like friendly with mine
hi girl thing I love you and like who
who should get staffers it's hard to say
me because like obviously every person's
experience is different I believe in
true love so I think there's like one
person that you'll love him like so
there's a difference between loving
someone being in love with someone yeah
you could be man across friends with
someone in like date soul and have like
a really good relationship and be like I
love you but then it's you're not like
in love like the person you're in love
with is like
ride-or-die so it's like I just feel
like some people say that and like if
that gets you going like go for it but
like is it like freak you out if four
girls like oh I gonna meet you but like
you can tell they say
like they're like like if you've known
the person for a while my god I Love You
Man it's like different but if you're
like you just are caught you ago and
they're like I love you but what if you
like each other but they're like oh I
just have to tell you something or like
you're like making out and they're like
no what do you think is like the right
time to say I love you okay if you think
you do like go ahead and say just be
careful I do you rate like yeah that's
something you sit her down you say
asking Claudia I have to tell you
something and you look them in the eye
and you say I love you Claudia I love
Kassadin and then they'll be like yeah
but you have to know it's right it has
to I feel like you would like hint that
if you like like if you're texting at
least between like I love and then like
you or like I love you yeah like if it's
like say if you don't put the eyes it's
like a whole different day there's like
those people that are like no big I love
you'll be like - love you - and then the
dead but the I but people like noticing
they freak out so that is it for today's
video be sure to check out askin and
Hudson's channels we're going to be
filming a bunch of videos for their
channels so yeah that will be all down
there and thumbs up this video if you
guys enjoyed it I love you guys whoa you
just said I love
I just know in the comments if you love
her - how you feel about that is do you
guys love me with the you or why it's
like it could be a you to be high oh I
don't know I think it was too soon how
easy is to say I too soon
all right Snagit camera but I don't want
to hit the camera cuz I would be like
boom it would fall back all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
