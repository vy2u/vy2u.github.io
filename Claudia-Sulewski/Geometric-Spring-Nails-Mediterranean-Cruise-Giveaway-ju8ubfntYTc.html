I'm going to start out by applying on
some hand cream and this is the lace on
today Boucher dry skin hand cream it has
20% shea butter and it's also non greasy
so they actually have it in a smaller
size as well which as you can see I have
it completely damaged it but I'm just
going to apply some on to my hands and
they are actually having a really
awesome giveaways so stay tuned till the
end of the video to find out more about
that so now first we're going to grab a
few pastel springy and nail polishes I
chose a purple one a pink one a yellow
and a green and we're gonna first start
out by just painting all of our nails
with one base color and I kind of
alternated between the polishes so
that's how my nails turned out once your
nails are fully dried you want to start
creating at your geometric nail design
and I'm just grabbing a different nail
polish color and just covering the tips
of my nails but kind of on an angle and
you can always use tape for this I
didn't have any so I just decided to
freehand it but you want to try to get
them to be as perfect and straight as
possible so I definitely do recommend
using tape
now you can definitely stop with one
layer like you can see here but I
decided to add one more layer of color
so I'm basically now going the opposite
direction and painting the other tip of
my nail with a third color and this part
was kind of hard so you probably will
get it all over you but it's okay
because you can clean it up afterwards
as you can see I kind of get it
everywhere
so these are how my nails turned out and
obviously they're not perfectly straight
but honestly who really cares so as long
as they're somewhat straight and it
turns out okay so now on to the fun part
which are these nail striping little
tape things I found them at PAX on four
literally like a dollar and they're the
coolest things ever they're basically
little tape strips that you put on your
nails and then you can just cut them
they come in different colors and I
decided to go with the goals because I
thought it kind of stood out and looks
really pretty against the pastel nail
polishes so all you want to do is just
lay it across the line where the two
colors meet and then you just Pat it
down so that it sticks here now and then
you can just cut it to finish off our
nail look I'm going to be using Essie
stop go and just applying one coat to
all of my nails
this will help from the tape falling off
and obviously your nails from chipping
I wanted to quickly talk about the crazy
giveaway that license is having right
now it is a 10-day cruise of the eastern
Mediterranean at four to passengers and
it's awesome you get to visit a bunch of
different places and the cruise also
includes a round-trip flights to Rome
Italy
so I mean you might as well try out for
it all you really have to do is just
click on the link in the downbar and a
winner will be chosen at random so if
you want to figure out all the details
it will all be on the website so I'll
have all the links down there so that
you can check it out thanks so much for
watching and I will see you guys later
