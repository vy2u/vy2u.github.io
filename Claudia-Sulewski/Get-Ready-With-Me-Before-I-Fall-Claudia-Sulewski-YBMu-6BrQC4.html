directed by a female it starts for
strong female characters and it's also
based on a railroad reference really and
it's also based on a best-selling novel

little well one is that one front action
through another hero was here in front
the other pulled back nice loose curls
and
kind of like glowy a nice like just like
bronzing dr.pepper thing that would be
nice like maybe like being like a wing

yeah it could be like a super simple I
don't know if he able to do wing with
like black shadow so it's not too
intense or something I want you like

example of a color not to be basic but I
really liked exposed by the Kylie you
