why brother Jim what your you little
sneaky man didn't dig into my grave
hey guys welcome back to my channel we
are in a slightly different location
today because we're trying out something
new I've never done this before and I
got really excited about it rather than
filming silent clips of me getting ready
with voiceovers on top I decided to film
a more casual video where I can still
talk to you guys and talk about the
entire process of getting ready but also
about other random things I'm gonna stop
talking now if you guys want to figure
out how I created this look right here
then keep on watching
alright if it sounds like we're filming
something very suggestive I have never
done this before I'm really excited side
note we've got Jim McDonald over here on
the bed behind you guys I don't really
have a plan for today's look but we're
just gonna see where this goes before
foundation I like to do something to
prime my face lately I've been obsessed
with the clinic dramatically different
moisturizing lotion I swear to god this
lotion is it's clearing out my skin and
also taking away redness so I just
applied two pumps of this and I mix it
in with the Saint Tropez self tan
classic face lotion to add a little bit
of color on to my face to match my body
now time for foundation I've been using
this foundation for definitely over a
year now I'd like to apply it with this
little spongy Beauty Blender and they
came out with a new color one I'm just
so smart because the pink ones always
end up looking so gross and dirty so I
was very happy about that what you doing
currently snapping you honestly you oh
wow yeah and I want to talk about really
difficult
Oh time down below if you're going to
Coachella because I am going for the
first time this year
MC I'm so excited Oh
what was that that's a tray next up I'm
going to use the Maybelline age rewind
dark circles eraser I always go back to
it it's really good
so applying it under the eyes I'm going
to add a little bit right here as well
oh yeah and then I'm just going in and
blending with this once again what is
your favorite show oh oh my gosh
okay what is it called Zsa jim-jim a
schoolgirl guys you need to see it it's
like an Australian TV show I think yeah
by the way I look like such a ghost
right now I promise what would I put
this in second by the way I am using the
laura mercier translucent powder and
impressing that on my face with this
sponge but anyways how do you explain
the amazingness of that show basically a
girl who goes to private school and she
just absolutely ridiculous and she's
played by a guy so it's just like extra
funny
yeah she's played by like a middle-aged
man and all her best friends are like
really hot young teenage girls and no
one acknowledges the fact that she's
literally a man um and it's really funny
it's good I've only seen one episode so
I don't know if I can say that's my new
favorite show but uh I highly recommend
for some good laughs giggles I use my
lightest foundation today and I think I
should have gone with a slightly darker
one but that's all good we're going to
fix that right now with some cool a
benefit bronzer so I'm gonna go in and
start contouring my cheeks what's the
first thing you do when you wake up and
the last thing you do before bed oh I
like that question but the first thing I
do when I wake up is read my text
message from Drew because every single
no texts each other Jim Jimmy Bob Jimmy
John's Junu Charo what about the Jim
Jimmy Kimmel really the first thing we
both did it is because we've been going
to the gym every morning which is a
super fun the last thing I do before I
go to bed once again I do something on
my phone whether it's like texting
someone good night or just checking all
of my social media for the day
say that's your answer - yeah how sad is
that it's sad but it's like we have to
keep like yeah it's like our job you
know like we have to keep up with stuff
would you like to tell us about your
first kiss story Claudia oh this is like
such a classic question he'll be
nameless which what should his name be
Daryl Daryl it was in eighth grade I
would say by the way guys filling in the
brows with my benefit browsing palette
and I'm using the gel first but anyways
after school my friend group and one of
our like guy friend groups we used to
always go to the park and play it was
time to say goodbye after all of us
playing at the park and like the girls
were doing on one side the boys were
standing on the other side and we're
going in to say goodbye and I remember
significantly struggling between should
I kiss him first and then hug him or are
you supposed to hug and kiss what do you
think Joe how old were you it's great
definitely hug that's what I thought
right no no no so we start going in to
say the goodbyes and Claudia is starting
to go in for the hug Daryl is trying to
go for the kiss so it kind of weird like
swooping motion goes where it looked
like I dodged his face or something and
then we awkwardly hug because he thought
he just got shut down I remember kind of
pulling back and being like wait and
then I kissed him and then that was it
that's some steamy stuff right there
isn't it very sensual very romantic what
about your first kids true my first kiss
was with a girl
now she planted it on me oh I was
definitely nervous to make the first
move so I'm kind of glad that it
happened that way it was good it was
this like a Packard was there I like oh
no there was definitely some tongue
involved whoa what your first kiss was
like a lady sold well right oh wow
nothing nah
yeah but like wasn't early either so
like I was definitely you know trying to
try to get the tongue in there Wow
straight drew that's a concept was
straight drew like a player straight
through did get the girls I will say
that she didn't I'm the biggest moves in
my grades oh well done thing well done
your burrito another question is which
trip you taking with Logan so far has
been your favorite oh so far Logan and I
have had three trips
that's like tough to answer because
they're all so different like I feel
like Logan and I do a lot of adventurous
things which is great it's so awesome
finding people in your life that
encourage you to like get out and do
things render than yeah exactly
adventure and do things rather than
thinking that's been like kind of like a
common motto that I've been saying in my
head lately is stop thinking about it
and just do it but I feel like each trip
was kind of very specific and different
on its own and obviously the more you
hang out someone the more you kind of
get to know them I don't have an answer
guys lately I've been using the Urban
Decay Gwen Stefani palette I've honestly
been using it almost every single day I
really really like the colors we're
going to be playing with this puppy
tonight guys I'm gonna go in with
Harajuku which is like a light taupey
brown and applied that to the queries
what are we doing tonight true we are
going out baby don't know where but
we're going out we're gonna leave the
house we're gonna leave the house maybe
take a venture to the grocery store in
these girls action is it the zoo zoo at
11 p.m. go record a song oh there's this
one Museum here called the death Museum
have you heard of it
no I'm really looking up and do you want
to go kind of okay how does like does
that not intrigue you I'm definitely
intrigued but I'm also concerned we're
gonna grab pop it's kind of like a rose
gold Goldy shimmery color and throw that
on I love the gold this is everything to
me
oh this is kind of more of a pink oh I
love rose gold well if all your videos
got deleted and you could only redeem
one back which video would you say oh I
already know my nighttime routine the
one that I filmed where different things
happen
right yeah that one yeah I'll link it
down below guys that is honestly my
proudest video because I love the
concept I love the way I filmed it the
music was awesome shoutout to Corby what
to do now
okay I'm gonna grab a slightly darker
brown and just kind of pop that in there
does anyone else kind of cringe and
people say like pop that in there like
I'm gonna pop some blush on my cheeks
that doesn't make me cringe no no I want
to pop this into my crease uh she has a
little cringy packing packing that's a
good one guys
stop asking questions about look at what
you're you little sneaky man drew
tweeted off my iPad and he's tweeting
let's see drew is such a hunk I love
that boy you made it too easy you know
I'm sorry I didn't realize we were like
16 again we're gonna add this little
burp pink glittery ball is eye shadow um
we're gonna put it on the out path where
would you like to live when you settle
down get married and have kids I feel
like I want to stay closer to the
western side of our country
up above California our little to the
right like somewhere more on this side
sorry mom and dad but I don't want to
raise kids in LA that's the one thing
that I know I'm going back in with this
medium brown eye shadow and applying it
to my lower lashes currently sure where
do you want to live I agree I don't live
like in LA but I definitely want to live
on the west coast
yeah um maybe like San Francisco really
that's what I was thinking like
somewhere up there yeah yeah somewhere a
little bit more
nor legally when I grew up I need a lake
house
I need jet skis tubes about tubes all
the above
like honestly so my best summer memories
me too how would the eyes looking what
do you think we're really good you're
serving great guys
oh thanks lately I've been really into
using black eye shadow as a substitute
for eyeliner I just feel like I have
more control it's softer it's not as
harsh so I'm just grabbing this little
angled brush and tapping it into the
black eyeshadow diam Claudia back ends
again with that eye shadow eyeliner oh
I'm sorry
he got a lifetime of vannes
like you know and the rest of his life
is that too big of a wine from back here
yeah it's a little crazy but like we're
going to the zoo I also like to bring
down the black eyeshadow I have a
question for you guys
I recently lightened my hair and right
now it's kind of more of like a light
brown I would say I don't know if I
would have a lighter darker the blonde
is such a look oh yeah do you think you
look more natural and like really into
dark hair be like oh yeah yeah great
with that yeah but like the light is
just like it's a fun little change it's
like a it's like it's almost summer it's
spring right now I'm lighting stuff up
like this is true yeah and I think
because I've already got my hair done
and I'm kind of already on that path I'd
rather do it now then reverse and then
do it later you know I'm just so just
for your hair so that's that's yeah fry
up rat a rat about my favorite mascara
is actually not the one that I'm using
today because I ran out of it it's the
benefit roller lash but this is my next
favorite it's their their real mascara
we're gonna go in and plan some mascara
benefit has the cutest packaging
yeah can we talk about what my mirror is
sitting under right now it's a giant
hoola box and inside they sent out all
their newest like hula bronzing products
which I will mention in my next
favorites video because they're so
awesome
oh my chapstick it's all the way over
there
but oh my god oh I found the chapstick
yes
my favorite video it is so good we
re-enacted it in San Francisco my gosh
uh-huh that for the lips I'm going to
try out a different and new product it
is the NYX lingerie lipstick it's like a
liquid lipstick so it dries matte on
your lips I have two colors and how to
figure out which one I want to use the
shade that I'm going to use is bedtime
flirt such sensual names called lingerie
I wonder what the other ones called
push-up oh yeah these are all sexual I
wish I had them all on me right now but
bedtime flirt is today's choice oh yeah
this one's good yeah lately I've been
all about the liquid to matte lipsticks
I feel like they stay on really well
I prefer matte lips over it glossy I'm
gonna go in and finish my brows because
I didn't really add on any powder it's
so sad that I'm literally not even
leaving this bedroom after this like
really fun too I feel like I should
honestly just keep that in yeah nicely
not going anywhere we're almost done
here ladies and gents um I'm gonna go in
with a blush that I actually haven't
used in quite a bit but I used to love
this stuff it's the Maybelline master
highlight highlighting blush this is in
the shade nude by the way just adding a
little bit of that lastly I'm going to
go in with my Mac mineralize skinfinish
natural in the shade soft and gentle and
just very lightly highlight my face I
don't want to put too much on because
the blush is already very highlighting
but I'm gonna add a bit to my nose above
my lip honestly let's let's chuck it
onto that brow bone let's pop it on
there yeah pack it what else can we call
packet smudge it smudge it pop and
mirror
