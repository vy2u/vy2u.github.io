face primer not really sure why I didn't
record that but I'm going in with the
NYX BB cream and my makeup sponge and
just dabbing that all over then I'm
going in with my Neutrogena skin
clearing concealer and just applying it
under my eyes and on any imperfections
and just blending that out with a
concealer brush after that I'm setting
my entire face with my benefit hello
flawless powder now I am just contouring
my face a little bit with my Kula
bronzer and a contouring brush
for blush I'm using rocket or which is
one of my favorite blushes to use
because I feel like it goes well with
every single makeup look and after that
I'm just highlighting my face with my
mac mineralize skinfinish in the shade
soft and gentle
next up is brow time my favorite time
because I love filling in my eyebrows
I'm using the Browse agogo palette and
just filling in my eyebrows
as you can see here
after that I'm going in with a highlight
pencil and just applying it underneath
my brows and blending that out with a
concealer brush
now to prime my eyes I'm using the la
girl pro primer and just blending that
out with my fingers
for today's eye makeup look I'm only
going to be using eyeshadows from the
Urban Decay Naked basics palette so I'm
starting off by applying on a very light
color all over my lids then going in
with a topi Brown in my crease and I'm
also going to be grabbing that same
shadow and applying that into the lower
lash line
I'm then going in with the lightest
color and applying it into my inner
tear-duct as well as my brow bone
eyeliner time I am using the NYX
two-timer eyeliner which is my favorite
at the moment and just creating a small
wing on my upper lash line
I'm then switching over to the other
side and grabbing the pencil liner to
line my lower lash line
using my NYX more to love mascara I'm
applying it to my upper and lower lashes
and that is it for the eye makeup look
now for the lips I'm grabbing one of my
favorite lipsticks in the entire world
and it is diva by Mac I've been really
obsessed with the dark and glossy lips
lately so I'm finishing off the lips
with my NYX butter gloss in the shade
devil's food cake and guys always
remember to use the finger trick to
ensure that you will not get any
lipstick on your teeth for hair I kept
it pretty simple that night but I went
in with my straightener and just curled
the bottoms of my hair and as you can
see I'm alternating from going inwards
and outwards to kind of keep it more
messy looking and natural looking I'm
then giving my hair a little bit of
volume by teasing it and spraying in
some volumizing dry shampoo
and now for the outfit starting off with
these shirts I'm wearing this white
cut-up shirt that I di wide myself with
a black lace bra from Victoria's Secret
underneath but for my coat I'm wearing
the statement coat from ago Jane calm my
black crossbody bag is from forever 21
and I kept the outfit comfy and casual
by just wearing some black leggings and
lastly for these shoes I'm wearing these
super cute booties from at Nasty Gal so
that is it for my getting ready video I
hope you guys enjoyed it and I will see
you guys for a new video very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
