your bags hey guys so for today's get
ready with me I will be focusing on
looking cute but also comfortable I also
wanted to thank Hanes for partnering
with me to create this video now without
further ado let's start off with the
makeup I'm dotting on my everyday
foundation and just blending that in
with a sponge
lately I've been contouring my face with
cream products and I find that it gives
you a lot more control so I'm just using
a darker foundation stick and blending
that in with a brush
now I'm doing the exact opposite and
highlighting the high points of my face
with a lighter concealer and then of
course I'm blending that out as well
to lock in and set my makeup I'm using a
translucent powder and just dusting it
all over my face
now for the eyebrows I'm grabbing a brow
pencil that's dark brown and I'm going
in and just filling in and creating a
shape for my eyebrows and then after
that I like to go in with a dark brown
powder and go over them to help darken
the brows and match them with my dark
hair color
today's eye makeup look is going to be
super simple because that's just the way
that I like to keep it but I'm using a
lighter pink and creating a cat eye
shape on the outer half of my eyes and
this is going to act as kind of the
bottom base for the darker color that
we're going to use so now grabbing
pretty much the same color but in a
darker shade I'm doing the same thing
and gradually kind of bringing it in so
you get a nice little cat eye kind of
look and then I'm also bringing that
down into the lower lash line for
eyeliner I'm using a dark brown gel
liner and creating a dramatic wing and
then also bringing that down onto the
lower lash line
to finish off the eyes I'm applying on
some black mascara to my upper and lower
lashes
to warm up my face a little bit I'm
going in with a bronzer and kind of
recontouring but giving it a softer look
and blend that down my neck as well
then to finish off the cheeks I'm
applying on a peachy blush to the tops
of my cheekbones tops that sounds so
weird and then for the lips I'm applying
on this liquid lipstick and I love the
whole brown lip color trend I think it
looks so cute for this time of year
before we get into the outfit portion I
quickly want to talk about what I'm
wearing underneath la la I'm wearing a
comfort flex fit bra from Hanes and I
love how stretchy and soft it is making
it extremely comfortable to wear they're
uniquely designed to shape and fit you
perfectly you got the full coverage
Hanes just knows what they're doing so
if you guys are looking for a new bra
they come in super easy to fit sizes
small medium and large yes it is that
simple but now let's get into the outfit
details so starting off with the jacket
I'm just wearing this chestnut brown
suede jacket really helps to kind of tie
in the whole fall theme as well as the
army green skirt it's got a really
pretty a-line shape that makes the
outfit look a little more fancier and
then the shirt is super simple it's just
a black v-neck and then lastly it we've
got the black over the knee boots which
are actually a lot more comfortable than
they seem to be so overall from the bra
to the boots it's a pretty comfortable
outfit like I would definitely wear this
every day if I could so that is it for
today's video thank you to Hanes for
partnering with me to complete this look
I am so obsessed with it and I will see
you guys for a new video very soon I
love you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
