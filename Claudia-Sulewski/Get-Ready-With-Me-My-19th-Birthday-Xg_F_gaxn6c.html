and foundation I'm grabbing my
Maybelline age rewind concealer and
applying it to the highlighting points
of my face after I blend everything out
I'm using my Tarte Amazonian clay powder
and setting my face
next up I'm using my benefit hoola
bronzer to contour my cheekbones jawline
and temples
to fill in my eyebrows I'm just using my
benefit to browsing palette in the shade
dark I never forget to prime my eyes
before applying on any shadow so I'm
using it the NARS lid primer and
blending it in with my fingers
with my lorac Pro to go palette I'm
grabbing the shade shell and applying it
all over my lids and my brow bone
to darken up the crease I'm using the
shade cafe and blending it in with a
bullet Villa a big fluffy brush I'm also
bringing down that same shadow into my
lower lash line after that I'm using
chai and applying it into the outer V
and outer half of my eyes whatever you
want to call it and blending that in as
well lastly I'm using the shade at Pearl
and applying that into the inner corner
of my eyes to open them up next up is a
liquid liner of course I'm using Kat Von
D's it's my favorite and I'm just
creating a small wing and bringing it
down onto my lower lash line to finish
off the eyes I'm applying on mascara to
my upper and lower lashes
for bronzer i am using benefits
coralista and applying it to the tops of
my cheeks then I'm using my favorite
highlighter from Mac which is soft and
gentle and applying that on the
highlighting points of my face then to
finish off the lips I'm just applying on
some lip balm because I didn't really
feel like wearing any color on my lips
today
as per usual I'm keeping the hairstyle
pretty simple all I'm doing is putting
my hair in half and curling it with my
straightener and basically the way you
do that is you just put the air into the
straightener you make a circle around
itself I'm so bad at explaining this
there are so many tours on YouTube
though but I really like doing it
because it's really fast and it leaves
you with really nice soft looking curls
so after that I just grab my hairspray
and scrunch it in
totally found my face now let's get into
my birthday outfit which by the way if
you are looking for any of the details
they will all be in the description box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
