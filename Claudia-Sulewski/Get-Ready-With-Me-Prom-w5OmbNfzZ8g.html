face and if you guys are interested in
any of the products that I'm using in
today's video I will have the complete
list in the down bar so after that I'm
just going in with my foundation and
Beauty Blender
next up I'm using my favorite concealer
to conceal my under eye circles as well
as highlight any parts of my face
after that I'm going in with a liquid
highlight dabbing it on the tops of my
cheekbones as well as my nose chin
Cupid's bow forehead
all that good stuff and just blending it
in now I'm just setting all my face
makeup with my favorite powder at the
moment
I'm also contouring my face with a
little bit of bronzer
before starting my eye makeup i always
like to fill in my eyebrows when going
to school dances it's always a good idea
to prime your eyes before any eye shadow
so that the colors stay on all night to
start the look off I'm darkening up the
crease with Urban Decay's teased
eyeshadow next up I'm placing Verve on
my lid using the eyeshadow pistol I'm
applying it into my crease to give a
little bit more depth into the eye
makeup
I'm also dragging it down into my lower
lashline
the last I shadow I'll be using is Urban
Decay's snakebite and I'm just applying
that into the outer corners of my eye
April Fool's that isn't the last
eyeshadow actually the last one is booty
call and I'm using that to apply into
the inner corners of my eyes as well as
on my brow bone so after that I'm going
in with a liquid liner and just creating
a small wing to open up my eyes I'm
using a skin toned eyeliner to place on
my waterline I struggle hardcore with
applying on false eyelashes so I did not
even bother filming that portion but
once I finally put them on I'm just
using my favorite mascara and applying
it to my upper and lower lashes for
cheeks I'm applying on my benefit rocket
or blush
I stuck with a light pink lipstick for
my lips and that is it for the makeup I
was running late and wanted to film my
outfit so for the hair all I did was
curl my entire head and twist back to
pieces in the front that is it for
today's video I hope you guys enjoyed it
and I will see you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
