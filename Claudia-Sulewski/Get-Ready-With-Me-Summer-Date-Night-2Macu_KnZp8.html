intro so today's video is going to be a
get ready with me at video date edition
so I'm gonna be showing you guys how to
create my date look for my date I know
how would you guys enjoy watching my get
ready with me videos so be sure to LIKE
this video if you're excited let's try
to get this video to 20,000 likes I've
never asked for likes before so I don't
know the appropriate number to ask for
but I feel like 20,000 is a pretty good
goal so let's see if we can get this
video to 20,000 within like the first
two days or something this is a mission
guys but although I just could we wanted
to thank Maybelline and Walmart for
working with me to create this video for
you guys now I'm gonna stop talking and
get back into the video this is me like
closing the intro on with the rest of
the video I'm starting off with my
makeup and using my Maybelline brow
precise pencil now as you can see I
already have my face makeup on from
earlier in the day so I am just filling
in my eyebrows to create a bolder and
more defined look
I'm also blending everything out with
the spooly on the other side so now
going into the eye shadow I'm going to
be using my chai latte quad and using
the crease color to apply onto my lid
and blending that into the crease to
kind of introduce our smoky eye for the
night to really darken up the look I'm
using new liner shadow and applying it
to the outer half of my eyes as well as
really high up into the crease and of
course blending that all out now I'm
using a thinner brush to use that same
shadow and apply it onto my lower lash
line
to add a little bit of color I'm dipping
my fingers into the lid shade and
tapping that on the center of my eyes
then I'm highlighting my inner corners
and brow bone with the base eyeshadow
now of course I have to play on some
liquid eyeliner so I've been loving my
master precise liquid liner from
Maybelline and I couldn't seem to get
this shot and focus apparently but just
create some winged eyeliner and then
lastly I'm going in with some mascara
this is the colossal volume Express and
it's gonna really help to add a bunch of
volume to my lashes which is perfect for
the night time I'm adding a little bit
of color and pink to my cheeks by using
my Mac blush in the shade desert rose to
finish off the makeup I wanted to add a
pop of color to the lips so I'm using my
Mac lipstick in the shade up up the amp
once I finished applying on lipstick I
have completed my makeup so now I'm
moving on to the hair portion I am being
very unoriginal and doing what I do best
which is just curl my hair so I'm
starting off by brushing out my hair and
applying on some spray-on dry shampoo to
add in that extra volume
when curling my hair I usually like to
split off the two sections and then
splitting that into top and bottom
sections and now I'm just going in and
wrapping my hair around my hot tools
curling wand to finish it off I'm
shaking out my curls and applying in
some hairspray mine is from big sexy
hair alright ladies we are two-thirds of
the way there now moving on to the
outfits I decided to dress a little bit
more fancy today so I'm wearing a black
dress from Topshop I've got a really
cool statement jacket from cameo and
lastly some Topshop booties
before I hand out today's video I
quickly wanted to thank Maybelline and
Walmart for working with me to create
this video for you guys and also we
actually filmed a really cool video on
Megan's channel where basically I teach
you guys how to shop the wall at Walmart
I'll have it right here it was very
interesting filming that because the
call time was from like 9:30 p.m. to
like 6 a.m. because obviously if you're
filming in a very popular general store
and there will be lots of people there
so that was definitely one of the more
interesting shoots I've ever done I
think everyone was just super tired and
delusional during all that but somehow
the video turned out really cute so I
only get on the screen for you guys
right here but also in general if you
want to check out any Bailey's content I
believe their channel right over here
but that is there for today's video I
hope you guys enjoyed it bye Twitter and
Instagram are over to the left I also
have a snapchat you can add me the
username is just clogging loose key and
of course subscribe to my channel for
more videos and I'll see you guys next
time bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
