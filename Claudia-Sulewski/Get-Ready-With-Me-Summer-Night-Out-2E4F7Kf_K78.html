fit me foundation to take away any
discoloration in my face
next up I'm using their Dream Lumi touch
concealer and applying it onto my dark
circles to brighten up my eyes
after that I'm using the matching face
powder to set my face makeup for bronzer
I'll be using the Maybelline master
bronze bronzing powder and it's great
for contouring because it has a matte
finish for today's eyeshadow look I'm
going to be using the mutes palette from
Maybelline so I'm starting off by
grabbing at the skin toned eyeshadow and
applying that all over my lid I'm then
darkening up the crease just a little
bit by using it the taupe eyeshadow from
the same palette I'm also dragging that
same taupe eyeshadow down into my lower
lashline Maybelline's trend for the
month is pattern place so I decided to
kind of spice things up with my eyeliner
and make it look a little different so
I'm using it their master precise liquid
eyeliner and I'm creating a wing but
also dragging the wing into my crease
and it was really hard to do this and
film it at the same time so I didn't get
too much footage of it but I really like
how it turned out
the eyeliner is a bit harsh so I'm going
in with these same palette and grabbing
a darker brown eyeshadow and applying
that into my crease as well as above the
eyeliner and this really helps to kind
of blend things out and make it look a
little less crazy in my opinion and then
I'm going in with the first eyeshadow
and just applying on another layer
to finish off the eye makeup I am using
my Maybelline big eyes mascara and
applying it to my upper and lower lashes
for the lipstick I'm using one of my
color sensational in the shade nude lust
four cheeks I'm using one of my all-time
favorite products at the moment which is
the Maybelline master highlight
highlighting blush so I just apply it to
the tops of my cheeks and it gives a
super cute dewy and rosy glow
now for the hair all I did was grab a
large curling wand and just loosely curl
all my hair then I went in with a hair
spray and quickly scrunch some in
for my nighttime outfit I'm wearing a
boxy striped shirt that I got from
Topshop then paired with that I wore
this wrapped zippered leather skirt that
has really cool geometric stitching on
the front and then for shoes I just kept
it cute but comfy with these chunky
heels from Topshop this video was the
first installment for my partnership
with Maybelline so check out Maybelline
City for all of their trends there will
be a new one every single month so I
hope you guys enjoyed seeing and I will
talk to you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
