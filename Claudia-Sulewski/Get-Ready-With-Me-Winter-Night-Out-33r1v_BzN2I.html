day that I uploaded happy Friday
it is currently at 7:00 p.m. right now
and tonight I'm actually going out to
dinner it's gonna be a fancy little
thing so I'm not gonna be wearing but
I'm currently wearing so today I decided
that I wanted to show you guys how I got
ready but before we get into that yo
girl is thirsty for caffeine not boys I
still don't really know exactly what I'm
gonna be wearing but I have an idea
luckily I already have makeup on my face
so I'm gonna have to do is just slap on
some darker eyeshadow and call it a day
there is nothing in here I don't know
why I'm looking in here I'm such a big
adult let's go just my outfit starting
off with bottoms I'm thinking of wearing
at this blue skirt you guys have seen
this before
it's from Topshop it's got like a zipper
in the front and I just really like the
coat of it
I actually really like pairing fancier
things with more casual pieces so this
may seem kind of weird but I'm gonna
take my black brandy melville a sweater
and tuck it in with this skirt it's just
a simple long sleeved dinner black
sweater and since it gets chilly at
night time here in LA I'm going to throw
over this black coat with my outfit so
this my coat is really cute I love the
shape of it this leaves our leather and
the rest of it is just like black
material and it's a really fancy cut so
it's really gonna play up the outfit I
actually got this jacket from hope look
calm if you guys don't know what
HauteLook is it's a site where they have
limited time flash sale events where
star experts will choose designer brands
for up to 75% off for you to purchase so
you can pretty much get anything your
heart desires on that website obviously
clothing but you can also get jewelry or
bags for beauty so you can pretty much
find anything on their membership is
completely free you also get free
shipping if you spend over $100 and you
get a 90 day return policy so overall
it's just a really beautiful website if
you guys are interested in checking it
out I will have the link to hautelook in
the description of this video so going
back to the outfit to this code is from
the brand Members Only but like I said
again I got it from hope look for shoes
I'm thinking of wearing these from
Topshop their little black keeled
booties and I love how they have little
stripes criss-crossing on top of them
and I think they're just perfect for
nighttime and to finish off look the bag
that I will be using it for tonight it
looks like this
so obviously it's more of like a
statement clutch the entire bag is
beaded with black beads and then on the
front you've got stones of gray and
turquoise and blue and I actually got
this bag as well from HauteLook the
actual brand is Mary Frances and yeah I
think this will go perfectly with my
outfit so to change up my makeup I was
thinking of using it via Naked 3 palette
nooner shade to be exact and just to
apply a little bit of it into the crease
to kind of darken on my eyes and prepare
it for the darker color that I'm gonna
put in the outer v of my eyes then
grabbing my naked 2 palette I'm going to
be using the shade pistol and applying
that into the outer v of my eyes and
this is going to make the overall look
darker and appropriate for nighttime I
was a little lazy today and didn't use
any eyeliner so
going with my cat Fonzie a liquid
eyeliner and apply it to my upper lash
line to create a small way I also really
like to have a bold and long looking
lashes for night time like so I'm gonna
go in with my NYX but Duncan Duncan
mascara and just a cloud a second coat
of mascara to of my upper and lower
lashes I wasn't really wearing getting
the products today just a little bit of
lip balm so I'm gonna take a lipstick
that is very similar to it lip color but
a little bit darker and this is the
matte lipstick in the shade oh it is so
pretty
and lastly I'm going to re modify my
face using the powder that I've
currently been obsessing with this is
the Tarte Amazonian clay full coverage
airbrush foundation it's just a powder
foundation and I would apply this to the
center of my face where I tend to get
most oily and that is all I want to do
my makeup tonight so let's go do
something with this over here this needs
to be done normally when I go out I like
to curl my hair and just let it fall
into loose waves so that is exactly what
I am doing tonight to comb my hair I
like to use my hot tools medium curling
wand it's already hot if you don't
believe me if you've never seen a video
of someone cutting their hair before
which I highly doubt this is how you do
it
take care wrap hair around the barrel
hold it wait it out do a squat then drop
the hair keep it in your palm do another
squad and ready for the cheesy editing
you're not ready you're not ready and to
finish off I'll usually spray in some
hairspray this is big sexy hair from
sexy hair it makes your hair super sexy
is
I want the world in my hands by hate the
beach
