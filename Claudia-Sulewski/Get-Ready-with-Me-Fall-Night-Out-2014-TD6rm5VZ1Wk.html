your face to finish what you started the
record spins down the alley late night
hey guys today's video is going to be a
getting ready with me video yeah so I'm
starting off by using my dream Lumi
concealer and applying it on any spots
that I'd like to highlight my face which
is pretty much everywhere and I just
blend that out with my Beauty Blender
once I was done with that I just set my
face with my mac mineralize skinfinish
natural in the shade and medium-plus
next up I must fill in at the brows and
if you guys want to find out what
products I used to fill in my eyebrows
then I will have my routine it linked
down below
I also can never forget bronzer so I am
using my all-time favorite benefit hoola
bronzer and just lightly contouring my
face and bringing it down to my neck
now it is time to decorate our eyeballs
I could not have phrased that any more
weirdly but I'm starting off by prepping
my lids with some primer for tonight's
look I wanted to use a shadows that were
very fall festive so this is my
Maybelline expert wear quad in the shade
autumn coppers and I'm starting off by
grabbing the human literally what was
that I'm using it the shade called base
and applying it all over my lids then
I'm grabbing it the crease shade and
wouldn't you know it I'm applying it
into my crease
to smoke everything out I'm using a
beeline er shade and applying it onto
the outer corner of my eyes and into the
lower lashline of course remember to
blend to everything out you do not want
any harsh lines that is a big no-no I've
got a lot of time to say random things
right now I don't know
blend it out
I honestly couldn't tell you when was
the last time I did my makeup without
doing my winged eyeliner so I'm doing
just that then I'm finishing off my eyes
with my Tarte mascara
Maybelline's chen for the month was a
mix and mats
so I played that trend in with my lips
by using the new color sensational
creamy mattes
in the shade divine wine it's like a
dark burgundy red beautiful plum color
I'm just completely obsessed with it and
it's perfect for the fall time and then
I left my hair natural because it was
wet from my shower and I didn't be like
doing anything to it so now let's get on
to the outfits
mobalage la luna brie less threat this
threat they're gonna vote developers
picture
so tell Gillette aroma
thank you so much for watching and be
sure to check out Maybelline City in the
downbar bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
