my channel in today's video I'm going to
show you guys what I do to get I'm ready
and wind down for the night no matter
what time I come home if I know I'll be
relaxing then my makeup has got to go
I have partnered up with simple skincare
to help me make up for my makeup so
we'll be taking out all the bad stuff
and putting in the good stuff that will
instantly rehydrate my face
we shall tackle the tougher area first
to the eyeballs I'm using symbols
two-part formula eye makeup remover and
putting a few drops on a cotton round
and guys this stuff takes off your
makeup so easily you don't have to
harshly rub your eyes and it also takes
off waterproof makeup
to take off the rest of my face makeup
I'm using the new simple cleansing oil
and just massaging that into my skin
this stuff is really ideal for sensitive
skin because it's such a delicate
process and once you've finished up with
that all you have to do is rinse off
your face with warm water you're left
with clean hydrated and soft skin with
no greasy oily feeling but nobody likes
that after I take care of my skin it is
now time for don't at all the food yeah
I have my priorities straight okay I've
been making this snack obsessively for
the past few weeks but it involves some
toasted bread some almond butter I like
to throw on some toasted coconut for
like a little crunch and then on top I
just slice some banana some days I feel
extra fancy and I decide hey let's throw
some honey on there it's so good and
then paired with that I'm drinking some
peach detox tea
at this point I like to bring my tea up
with me and work on my computer also
everyone please acknowledge this artsy
flower shot so great
anyways I'll usually work on emails or a
lot YouTube videos brainstorm things
like that it's usually boring stuff like
emails tonight I decided I wanted to
treat myself or I guess my hair because
I'm gonna do a hair mask I feel like
people are always talking about face
masks but we cannot forget about our
hair people I'm using my way hair masks
they come in little packets and you just
massage it into your hair targeting
mostly on the ends but if you guys don't
own any hair masks if you're not you can
totally just use your conditioner and
put that in for a longer period of time
or you could make your own using coconut
oil avocados honestly the options are
kind of endless so I've got about 10 or
15 minutes to kill and the greatest
piece of advice I could give you guys
towards having a motivating and
productive day is making a to-do list
the night before
I'm always waking up Spacey and confused
so having a general guideline of what I
want my day to look like really helps to
get things that movin and groovin now
I'm just rinsing off my hair mask and
this shot cracks me up because I was
shooting water everywhere without
realizing it oh what a goofball and
after that I just brushed my teeth
flossed them did that whole shebang now
that I finished getting unready
I can chill out for the rest of the day
depending on what time it is so whether
I end up watching a movie with my
roommates or I just have some alone time
most satisfying feeling to me is being
able to relax knowing that I finished
all of my daily tasks that's why my
first step in my routine is to always
take off my makeup simple allows me to
make up for any of the makeup I wear
during my day by taking out the bad and
putting the good back in which is the
perfect way to end the
