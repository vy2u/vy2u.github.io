hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today I'm going to be doing a little a
collaboration with aspen hopper islands
here on YouTube so like this video for
hashtag class then because we're the
best ship ever asthma and I are going to
be recreating looks from Teen Vogue
cover stars so aspen is going to be
doing a little bit of fashion in her
video and i'm going to be creating a
Lawrence hair and makeup for her cover
look also if you guys haven't seen at
Teen Vogue the cover yet with Lord then
I'll be sure to leave a little
annotation here so you guys can check it
out watch it and subscribe of course
because it's amazing so other than that
let's just get right into the tutorial
I'm starting off the makeup look with my
Neutrogena skin clearing foundation and
just stabbing that on with my Beauty
Blender to cover up those dark circles
i'm going in with my Maybelline instant
age rewind concealer and applying that
underneath my eyes and blending that all
in
to cover up any other little
imperfections I'm going in with my
revlon stick concealer and just stabbing
that on and of course blend everything
out you guys know the drill to set all
of your face makeup grab any of your
favorite face powders and apply that on
with a big fluffy brush to give my face
a little shape and contour I'm going in
with my benefit hoola bronzer and just
shadowing any areas that I want to
contour on my face
now it's time for the eyebrows I'm going
in with my benefit browser go go kit and
filling in my eyebrows to kind of
replicate Lords so as you can see Lords
eyebrows are super dark but they don't
have a very high arch to them to prime
my eyelids i'm using my mix i pencil in
the shade french fries and just applying
that on my lids I'm then blending out
this product with a clean eyeshadow
brush lastly i'm using this pencil to
line my lower lash line as well to prep
for the other shadows so today i'm going
to be using the lorac pro to go palette
and I'm first grabbing the shade chai
and applying this all over my lids
I'm also blending out the edges to keep
the look soft but keeping the shadow
pretty low on the eyelid next up I'm
using the eye shadow mink and applying
this on my lower lashline and blending
that out
to highlight my brow bone I'm going in
with a light nude eyeshadow and dabbing
it on with a small dome brush
Lord also highlighted her inner tear
duct so I am using the pearl shadow from
the palette and dabbing that on that
same she also brightened up rise by
using a white eyeliner so i'm using my
tart inner rim liner and just lining my
eyes this method will really help to
open up your eyes making them appear a
lot bigger lastly just apply on your
favorite mascara to your upper and lower
lashes and the eye makeup is done
Lord rocked a peachy blush in her cover
looks so i'm using my mac blush in the
shade peaches
I'm also highlighting my face with my
Mac MSF in the shade soft and gentle
to replicate Lords lip color I'm using
my Neutrogena color stick and applying
it to my lips that is it for Lords
makeup looks so now let's move on to the
hair I'm starting off by splitting my
hair into two sections and just putting
the top half up and out of the way to
curl my hair I'm going to be using a
bubble style curling wands because I
feel that it gives my hair the bounciest
curls
I'm making sure to grab one to two inch
sections and having every piece curl
away from my face once I finished with
the bottom half I'm going through with
my fingers and quickly brushing them out
to loosen up the curls then I'm just
pinning it back and letting down the top
half just like before i'm curling
one-inch sections of hair away from my
face before applying on any product i'm
giving my hair one last run through with
my fingers then i'm going in with my
sexy hairspray clay and just spring that
on to the bottom half of my hair while
stretching it in
and that is it for my recreation of
Lords bouncy and curly hair it did not
take a long time at all it was super
quick and easy that is it for today is a
makeup and hair tutorial I really hope
