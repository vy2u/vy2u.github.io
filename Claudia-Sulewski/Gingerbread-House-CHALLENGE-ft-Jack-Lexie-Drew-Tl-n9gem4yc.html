I'm going to do this hey guys so in
today's video I have a few youtubers
with me we've got Jack in the kitchen we
got Lexie over the left we got drew to
be was enough left the most left and me
so today we're going to be doing a
Christmas holiday challenge as you guys
can see basically we're going to have 20
minutes on the clock to create the most
coolest and swagga sh houses ever and
then again you guys will vote who made
it equalist house I guess we should just
start getting ready
it's not going to be given to where do
you begin
imagine elections autumn ejections no
let's just say I think usually gets an
erection like a lot going on I'm over
pretty over all fiance
Oh anyways the nipple oh oh I don't even
realize you have to stick it yeah oh my
god I know this is hard this is her oh
you have to stick it onto the ground I
didn't need my icing step 1 meat icing
all that why
yo guys I have to hold up just saying
balls
this is way too difficult how are kids
supposed to do this with the help of an
adult you know it probably says 18 or so
around here so what is the bottom of the
roof there's like a random like line I
don't know I need to look at the box
Oh you break it something's up you're
ready to suck it
I'm not breaking mine I think you're
supposed to oh oh oh
yeah guys make some eye contact with the
viewers every so often
oh sorry just keep them in mind should I
got this super glue oh my things are
coming out anymore I'm worried for you I
can be a few moments later pressure is
definitely like a factor oh my god yes
oh yeah I remember she had her system
what was their system
Lex me tell us about your system Jenny I
think the line wow you have the same
system going on here few inches late
hill so we have finished our gingerbread
houses top table we got here okay all
right
my favorite flavor is chocolate so I
wanted to incorporate chocolate
oh we have it's a nice chocolate layered
a group with some rice krispies we have
to write a quo so my favorite quote of
2014 is Sukkot so you know I just went
outside of Annapolis also we have on the
back drew rolls just in case you guys
didn't know yeah it's pretty simple but
I think it's cute
Carrie Ann Inaba sex oh wait what and I
am Goodman 7-o right now Julianne huh
7/7 I mean honestly yeah yeah I'm gonna
get terrible rates room after she the
missus left a lot thank you it was a
really great custom time those rice
krispies looks like there's like haha
alright alright I think you did a great
and neat job knowing I will say the red
I say looks a little bloody all over the
Christmas show so can we get that in
slow motion as we actually got that info
Martha
I think the Hat roofing is like many
girls Jason Seifer it's like a
pre-planned neighborhood house where
like they're nice-looking don't get me
wrong but they lock back that character
that so this is my house I work very
hard on it in the front you see at the
garland with the little red dots
can you around
the Christmas festivities I want people
to know that I know what mama says but
I'm young but like don't eat me I'm
trying to stay here on the back you can
come to my party I got a white pool with
a little bit of colors and here in
Lexi's world it doesn't snow white it
snows colorful so the snow on the roof
is multi-coloured carry ethanol bo7 Len
Goodman 7.5 Juliet huh 8
I've been putting the numbers up I'm
just embracing my tan we appreciate the
little roof so pop the windows I feel
like you definitely innovated the Oreos
in a very creative way
definitely nice touch that's why I got
the higher point yeah Oh are some videos
where you could have done a bit of your
job don't know and I'm alright the human
race I am a little confused about the
circle red door it kind of looks like a
little dog door and if I could fit
through that so my gingerbread house is
the ultimate party house so when you
look in the front you've got a sign that
says turn up everyone's having a great
time no one is ever sad in this house it
says ginger X and that is a reference to
Project X because this is the project X
version of a gingerbread house the other
side has some a dollar signs because we
have free money inside and some notes
because we're comes to the king so great
tunes in the house you've got a Jacuzzi
over to the left we have a little
barbecue with some patties
there and we've also got a little
playpen of some balls if anyone wants to
dive in there and have a great time
Carrie Ann Inaba 8 Len Goodman 8 Joseph
9 yes I would like to comment on the
precision okay everything looks really
neat organized there's a barbecue
there's nothing I'm not eating anything
less than an eye with you Adam America
there's so much detail and I really
really give you credit for that so why
did I get the age oh wow sorry it looks
very cute like you're saying there's our
money sides and notes everywhere and it
says sure enough I would be looking for
more of an impact phone I think that
some of the designs were just unrelated
and more uniform I like things very my
house is just a house stuff that I was
working with also I decided to go with
the roof writing technique and I wrote
yes because yes this is my house so I
had the sprinkles on the side of my roof
which I love because I love sprinkles
and added like nice pop on both sides
everything about house is very
symmetrical carry on contra 6 thanks lad
good man 7 thank you
7 just taking this personally but
yourself
I ain't give you a 5 wow that's just
because I need to say
I think it's the low score Beauty do
feel as though it lacks a lot of
creativity you know the sides don't have
anything going on in them I feel like if
this house was in a movie it would
definitely be one of those props that
was part of the background the
characters would not be living in it
like not in the extras I don't know what
this really describes you like I
wouldn't yes that's Jack Palace is a
gingerbread house we were using icing
and sprinkles
however when we're just focusing on the
point wasn't making a gingerbread house
you did that I feel like the colors
aren't very Christmasy it's more eastery
to me
the cards are Christmasy right that's
what I like about your crime do we have
a deeper issue your guys first once you
take it out thank you guys so much for
watching if you guys might just be doing
and be sure to give a thumbs up and
comment down below who do you guys think

now before you guys go I quickly wanted
to talk about one more thing
earlier this month I filmed a really
really cool project with the I love
makeup channel here on YouTube the video
turned out really goofy and funny and it
basically shows how Bobby Brown helps me
with an emergency Beauty crisis not to
give anything away but I end up getting
a little wet from a car splashing me
