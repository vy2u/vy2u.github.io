find out about the rules for the good
way
everyone okay so first off I just want
to quickly say something that doesn't
really have to do with this video but
happy new years because i didn't really
wish you guys on video i hope you guys
had an awesome new year's eve and i hope
that this year is going to be really
great for all of you guys and I'm really
excited and also i want to mention that
yesterday i did upload a video of just
like a slideshow of my best like 2010
memories and i just had like a bunch of
photos and like music playing and i had
to remove it for like many different
little reasons but um I did upload all
the photos to my blog so if you want to
see those but they're kind of small like
you see all the photos but they're kind
of like really really tiny so you don't
get like all the detail but you kind of
can get it just stuff like what that
video is about so I'm sorry about
tooling that but i'll have my blog in
the downbar not blog yeah my blog whoa
what the heck ok so now to the main
topic about today's video and today is
going to be your view so um basically
the main topic of this video is going to
be about skin care now before I say
anything you guys probably think ok
Claudia well you have like perfect skin
I never saw up and blow on your face and
that is not true because I'm very like
well right now I barely have I don't
have like any acne but I'm always like
at least this much far away for you guys
so you guys can't really see everything
that's going on here um so yeah I did
have acne I mostly get acne like I
caught my sunburn so like you know how
people say this is like your t-zone I
call it sunburn so I'm like where you at
son Bert which is like at the top of
your cheeks and like your nose like
right here that's where I get acne and
then also sometimes again I'm like up
here on my hairline and then on my chin
and then I don't really get any on my
maid forehead like not me I mean milla
my forehead um so basically today I want
to talk to you guys about an awesome
product that i've been using on my face
lately sorry it's a good down little um
and it's basically it's called the xeno
heat treat and this stuff is seriously a
miracle
I'm like in love with this stuff I'm
asking to tell you guys why okay so yes
the company did contact me but you guys
know I don't lie in my videos alright so
when they contacted me I I was like
really really excited because you know I
never really thought of an acne like
treat system with using heat like I've
never even thought about that like I
thought about the clarisonic I've never
thought about like using heat for your
face so of course I was like oh my god I
gotta try this and tell you guys like my
opinions on this stuff because I never
really tried anything like that before
so I sort of excited so first off
there's two products that you get in the
little box so first off you get um this
treatment right here which I'm going to
talk more into detail later and then
also you get the little heat system that
vibrates and it heats up so basically
what they say on the box is for the
treatment they say that it destroys
ninety-nine point nine percent of acne
bacteria in one hour when you have it on
your face it also helps prevent future
breakouts and it also unclogs your pores
and just penetrates them and it's also
very hydrating so it's gentle on your
skin too so that's a big claim that the
treatment actually does and also for the
device right here so it actually has
like this massaging action that's what
they call it that optimizes results it
also has a very gentle and soothing heat
and it's one hundred percent natural so
yeah this is what you get these are like
the main tea products that you use so
now I'm going to talk about kind of like
how you use them okay so first off you
wash your entire face so I do this I do
this every single day before I go to bed
I don't use this in the morning i use it
at night time and i'm going to tell you
guys why so the first thing that you
have to do is I really really like how
simple this is um and you don't really
need like water or anything to do this
but first off of course you have to wash
your face and I've been using this for
so long and it's the Burt's Bees soap
bark and I
I pronounce this camel mile I don't know
but you guys always kill me with that
because I'm Nadia say it but it's the
deep cleansing cream so first off I just
wash my face with this cleanser right
here and then I clearly drown my face
with a towel and that is when you start
to use yours you know he treats you have
to make sure that your face is
completely washed off with dirt and
makeup and oil and it's completely dry
and then you use these problems so then
you take this Zeno heat-treat blemish
prevention treatment and this is the
stuff that kills ninety-nine point nine
percent bacteria it comes like in a
little bottle like this it's really cute
um and basically here let me show you
guys it comes out like that and like a
little tube thing basically what you do
is you just take some on your fingertips
and you spread it out on your entire
face and you just leave like a thin
layer on your face and you guys know
that I don't get acne everywhere I just
kind of get in random areas so I don't
really put it like all over my forehead
because I don't really have acne on my
forehead so um basically what I'm trying
to say is that anyone can use this all
types of skin types too so if you have a
lot of acne all over your face you can
put this all on your face but if you're
someone like me that only has spots acne
you can just put them in those little
spots so I'll put it all over my cheeks
and like this like bottom half of my
face and then I won't really use it on
my top half sometimes if I have acne on
my hairline then I'll use it just to
kind of save up some of the product so
basically what you do is you just put a
thin layer on your face and then you go
to this thing and this thing is so so so
cute it's like palm size you can put in
your pocket butter know why you would um
but basically you turn off this little
button and I already turned it on and it
starts vibrating so I don't know if you
guys can hear that okay well yeah so
basically when you okay I just turned it
off but um you turn it on with this
little button and it starts vibrating in
this little circle right here starts
heating up and it gets pretty hot it's
not like too hot or like hurts your skin
or irritates it or anything but it gets
kind of like
warm hot but not you know burning hot
and basically we do is you just smooth
it all over your entire skin and what I
like to do is if I have like a big
pimple somewhere or is it somewhere then
I'll leave it on that pimple for like a
minute or something like I'll leave it
on their supposed to especially on my
nose because I get a lot of acne on my
nose so I kind of focused it a lot in my
nose but basically all you do is you
just massage it all over your entire
skin and you can stop it whenever you
want to but also I'm not really I okay I
have no idea one but after a couple
minutes or like a min or something it
automatically shuts off by itself just
so that you know it doesn't like stay on
the entire night if you forgot to turn
it off or anything like that so after a
couple minutes it like turns off by
itself but you can just click it back on
if you want to keep on using it and you
can keep on using it um and I really
really like this because this thing
feels like a facial at home like when I
first use this I was seriously amazed
because when you put it like on your
face it's like it's really hot and it
just feels like you're like at a spa or
like you're getting a facial and it
feels so good that's why i love using
this every single day because not only
is it helping and caring your acne but
it also feels like you're getting a
facial and your face just feels amazing
and like fresh after using it so
definitely love love love this you just
need to double a batteries of this and
what's really nice that they actually
come with batteries in the little box
thing like you guys can't release it but
it comes with two double A batteries
which is what I really really like
because it kind of shows that you know
they do you know put a low offer it into
the packaging and stuff like that
because some some kind of things that
really need batteries don't come with
batteries and it's kind of like an oven
to go out and buy some so it's really
good that they actually include some of
the packaging but let me go back to this
blemish treatment stuff the only thing
that I'm going to say about this is this
doesn't bother me personally but it
might bother others is that the solution
to this is very watery it's like a
watery kind of oily like substance
and we put on your face it kind of feels
like a little bit like oily or whatever
and that might bother some people
especially if you think okay well I have
oily skin why would I put oily stuff on
my face trust me once you're done using
this thing because this is what you keep
on um massaging this into your face once
what ah once this is absorbed into your
skin so your face doesn't feel oily once
you're done using it but when you apply
it on it kind of feels like it so you
might be thinking like okay well I've
oily skin why am i adding oil or oil but
it really doesn't bother me because
whenever I run out of like makeup wipes
I always use like baby oil to wash off
my like makeup or whatever and I'm like
really really used to it so it doesn't
bother me at all and a little goes a
long way with this stuff I just kind of
keep it laying right next to my sink and
use that every night so overall i give
this like a 5 out of 5 stars i can
definitely tell a difference i'm not
even kidding like the first time I used
it I thought I saw like I could have
sworn I saw like a difference already
but um I don't know it feels just like
my mind or something cuz I don't even
know if I can believe myself but I legit
thought that like it did work after the
first time I don't know like it feels
like my mind or something or maybe it
actually did but I didn't want to tell
you guys that cuz you guys to be like
okay she's so lying it's not gonna work
after the first time but i'm not even
kidding i seriously think it did but um
definitely within like a week you'll
definitely see like a clear like
difference by like a landside that's why
i really like these and also i think my
favorite part about this acne I'm system
stuff is you don't have to change your
everyday face routine because of this
you don't have to change it because you
can still use the sink cleanser the same
moisturizer toner or whatever you can
use the same exact stuff and just add
this into your everyday face routine
which is really what I really really
liked because I didn't want this to go
all the way stand like not use this
anymore so it's just kind of like an
additional thing you do to your face
just to perfect it and get that
me out of there so that's probably like
my favorite part about this for like how
it looks and stuff like that definitely
like five out of five I think it looks
very like slick and kind of futuristic I
don't know i really really love this
product though and i'm going to leave
the description not just description
well i'm going to leave the link to the
website where you guys can purchase this
online and i'm going to leave it in the
downbar don bar that's going to be like
the first link that you'll see so you
could just click there and go and get
your own see no cuz this is so cute i
don't know like all my friends already
know about it I'm like oh I like I
already told all my friends about the
xeno know like it's so cute and I'm like
that's awesome i like showed him i was
like super excited when I got it and I
still AM every single time I use it I've
been using it for a while now I've been
using it for a couple of weeks so
seriously I definitely like one hundred
and fifty percent encourage you guys to
go out and try the xeno if you haven't
already it works for all skin types you
can use it for dry skin oily skin
sensitive combination or doesn't even
matter how much acne you have on your
face this thing will work and that's
what I love about it so it's very
reliable so so far I've been loving it
um I think I'm like that much down I
don't know but um I still got a lot left
in this and i'm pretty sure that once i
run out of this treatment right here i'm
probably going to go ahead and buy
myself a new one which is also what i
really like i didn't mention is that
when you get this you know heat treat
and you know you're loving it this runs
out you can go ahead and buy you don't
have to buy completely news you know you
can just buy an extra one of these by
itself which is really awesome and I
think the pricing for these things is
perfect it's really awesome so I really
like that and it's now another exciting
