talking about glossybox and some of you
may know what I'm talking about and some
of you may not it's a monthly
subscription website where basically
they send you a box every single month
of just different products so it's a
great way to try out different things
that normally you wouldn't reach for and
stuff like that it's very similar to
rich box and my glam my glam bag
whatever it's called I really know but
it's sort of like that and glossybox was
super popular in the UK and I think
Australia or something like that they
recently started doing it in the United
States as well so it's kind of exciting
and today I'm going to be unboxing a
glossy box so first of all the box
itself this is how you get it when they
send it out to you it's super cute it
says glossy backs on the front but it
also says my dress so I don't want to
show you guys that and then when you
open it up it looks like this so you
have another box in there I received
this box a couple days ago so I was too
anxious to wait and see what's in here
so I have already looked inside and kind
of messed up with all the wrapping and
stuff because the packaging is really
cute but I haven't really tried anything
else I mean any of the products or
anything like that so this is basically
like an unboxing video I guess so when
you open up the box they actually wrote
me a little card so that was on top Oh
in the inside of the box is really cute
too looks like that and then in the
front they had like a little ribbon and
then a sticker and tissue paper and then
also inside it has the little black
papers I don't know it looks cute and
then also they give you a card which
looks like this and then on the back it
says all the products that are in the
box and it talks briefly about them so
yeah let's just get into the first one
so the first item in this box is the
amore Pacific moisture bound refreshing
hydrogel and I'm guessing this is a
sample size because it's really small
but it looks
this and when you open it you can see
the product in there it's like a light
green e blue color on the card it says
that it's a hydrating gel moisturizer
that leaves your skin feeling bright and
refreshed notice your complexion visibly
improve giving you confidence and a
natural glow I like the smell of is to
it just smells very clean and refreshing
so the next item in here is the burberry
a beauty lip mist natural sheer lipstick
and this is the packaging and this is in
copper number 202 when you open it up it
looks like this it's very cute sleek
packaging and when you open it up look
at how cute this is it is like a mini
little lipstick I don't you guys can see
that but it has a really cute little
pattern on the side too I know I always
seem to notice those little teeny
details but it's super cute so I'm just
going to give you guys a quick swatch of
it it's a lot darker in the tube than it
is on my hand it's a lot more like sheer
and lighter once you actually use it so
yeah this might be a little bit too dark
for me I'm not sure because you guys
know how much I love light lips like
this for me is like dark I'm wearing
like kind of corlee lip stay but I don't
know if this turns out to be a little
bit too dark for me then it just give it
to my mom because she likes darker
colors but yeah it looks like that and
then on the card it says that it's a
creamy lipstick that offers a hint of
natural sheer cover leaving your lips
moisture and dewy the perfect present
for the perfect pout so that is the
burberry Beauty lip mist natural sheer
lipstick so next up we have the Marvis
whitening toothpaste which is actually
funny because I just ran out of the
current one that I'm using now which is
from burt's bees and I actually really
like it but I like just ran out so this
is like perfect timing um yeah but it
looks like this it's just a whitening
toothpaste nothing really special bond I
guess I
on the card it says make the most of
your spine and smile with a whitening
toothpaste dripping and cool mint
freshness all while protecting against
UK tartar and plaque so yeah so next up
we have the I think it's pronounced Fido
Jabba um intense hydrating mask for dry
hair which is perfect for me because my
hair is very dead and dry on the ends
because I have bleached my hair so many
times and I've always accepted try out
you conditioners and like hydrating hair
products so yeah this is the packaging
of it you take it out it looks like this
indulge and luxury and aroma with a
conditioning treatment that moisturizes
and detangle strands without weighing
hair down nourish revive and delight so
it looks like this and let's smell it oh
my gosh it's really really minty oops I
just squeeze some out but I'm actually
excited to use this because I normally
don't buy minty like smelling hair
products so this is going to be
different for me because usually i
purchase like kind of fruity and like
tropical sense so this is going to be
different I've said to use it if you
guys want my feedback on it maybe I'll
like tweet about it or write a post
about or something so we'll see how this
works hopefully it does because my hair
is just it needs as much moisture as it
can get so the next product in here is a
so yeah nail polish and it's from the
summer 2012 beach and surf collection
and this is in the shade Arizona I am so
excited to start using this nail polish
because tangerine and orange is super in
this summer and this is just the perfect
neon like tangerine orange color haven't
used it yet but I will be putting it on
my toes probably tonight because I'm so
excited to use this um and yeah I've
never heard of this brand so I'll see
how much I liked it and if it's you know
good and stuff and yet this is probably
my favorite thing out of this whole box
because
love nail polish and I've been looking
for a nice orange color this is like
perfect um and yeah oh also they gave me
a little brush from GlossyBox so I just
put that in there too and that is if
that's in the box so I hope you guys
enjoyed today's video and comment below
if you guys want me to give you guys
some feedback on any of these products
if you do want to like purchase them or
if you're interested in them so that is
it for today's video I hope you guys
enjoyed it and yeah that is it okay hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
