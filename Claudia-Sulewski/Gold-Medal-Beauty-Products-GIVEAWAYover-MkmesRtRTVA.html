coming up today I'm going to be showing
you guys my gold medal of beauty
products which is basically all the
products that I have always loved and
the ones that I think should earn a gold
medal and also I don't know if you guys
know this about me but I am a clean and
clear ambassador and clean and clear
were actually the ones who came up with
this awesome video idea so along with
showing you guys all my favorite
products I'm also going to be doing a
giveaway for this video so if you want
to find out more about the giveaway how
to enter in all that stuff just watch
the end of this video because I'm going
to be talking about it at the end so
other than that I'm just going to get
right into it because I've got a lot of
stuff to show you guys so first I must
start out with my gold medal facial
cleansers and I actually have to because
one of them I use at nighttime and the
other i use in the morning so the one
that I use at nighttime is the Burt's
Bees natural acne solutions I've talked
about this numerous times it really
helps with my acne and it takes off make
up really nicely so that's why I use it
at night time and then the one that I've
used in the morning is actually the
clean and clear morning burst for fruit
infusions hydrating cleanser it's oil
free it also has little strawberry seeds
in it so it kind of exfoliates your face
and it smells so good it smells exactly
like summer so it reminds me of just
like vacation in the summertime and I
think it's really pretty too those are
my gold metal facial cleansers so my
gold metal face moisturizer is the
Burt's Bees sensitive daily moisturizing
cream I'm I'm just not going to talk
about it because you guys know how much
I love this um so yeah you guys probably
have heard me talk about that my gold
metal foundation is the l'oreal true
match foundation which looks like this
and i'm in the shade and three natural
buff this is my second bottle the color
of this shade matches my skin tone
perfectly it is the perfect color for my
skin so that's why I love it so much and
actually really like it so that would
have to be my favorite foundation my
next favorite face product is the mac
mineralize skinfinish natural and I'm in
the shade medium plus i always put this
on my face whether i'm wearing
foundation or not it has actually some
pretty nice coverage to it and this is
my second one of these i love it so much
i use it pretty much every single day my
golds metal blush would have to be the
fret boy blush by the bomb it is the
bomb I'm sorry that was really cheesy
but it looks like this I love the
packaging first off and I really like it
because it's peachy but pinky at the
same time so it's really nice for the
summer and spring and just like the
warmer season so I'm actually wearing a
little bit of it today but yeah I've
been really liking this blush I've been
wearing it all the time my gold smile
bronzer would have to be the too faced
chocolate soleil bronzer this is my
mom's because might actually broke and
I've been waiting to finish up all my
other bronzers before I buy a new one
because I want to like use up the ones
already have and i just finished them so
next time I go to support i'm definitely
going to repurchase it it smells so good
it's matt it's just a really nice color
so this would definitely have to earn a
gold medal in my be so that is it for my
gold smile face products the next one is
for my eyebrows and I've actually made a
video entirely on this product it's the
benefit browse of go go brow and I
shaping kit I love this so much I use
every single day to fill in my eyebrows
and I am clearly running out of it I
really only use that but I really really
like it so I'm probably going to
repurchase it soon and I just like how
small and compact it is it's great for
traveling so then I have three gold
medal I products the first one has got
to be the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer
potion mine is so beat up an old and I'm
almost finished with it whatever i'm
wearing eyeshadow i always put it on
because it makes it last all day my next
favorite is the covergirl LashBlast
waterproof mascara i bought in like 30
these really are waterproof so it's
great if you're going to someone's like
house and you want to wear a little bit
of mascara if you're going to the pool
or the beach or something and you want
to wear mascara then it's really great
because it doesn't smudge and my last I
makeup product is of course the naked
I'm going to Kate naked palette and
specifically my favorite eyeshadow is
buck which is right there love putting
it in my crease and yeah just enough
said everyone loves this product so then
I have two golds metal lip products the
first one is my iOS chapstick this thing
is so disgustingly like dirty on the
outside and you can see how far I've
gone into it but I wear this everyday
before I put on any other lip product
and its really nice it smells really
nice as well and then my golds metal
lipstick would have to be the mac
lipstick in myth um if you guys ever see
me with new lips which is basically
every single video I'm wearing this
lipstick what I do with it is I don't
just put it on because that looks really
like too much what I have to do is just
dab it on really really lightly so I
don't really have too much on my lips
and it just looks like that it's matt
and its really really nice so definitely
going to have to repurchase this once I
run out so then I have three different
gold medal nail polish pics the first
one is the SE mad about you top coat
which looks like this I love putting
this on basically every single color
especially black it just spices it up
and just looks really cool so I really
like that my next one is the sally
hansen complete salon manicure nail
polish and this is in cafe owl lot a lot
it looks like that though and it's just
a creamy tan color I love it it like is
basically my skin color so I really like
how it looks matches to everything then
my last one is the SE lilac is omnia
polish it just looks like this it's a
pastel violet color and Purple's my
favorite colors so I love wearing this
on my nails my goals metal perfume would
have to be the viva la juicy perfume for
sure this is my second bottle of this
perfume it's so pretty it smells so good
and it's basically like all I have to
say about it just smells amazing if you
haven't tried this you need to go buy it
because you are going to fall in love
and I wear it like every single day
along with the taylor swift wonderstruck
perfume i just like switch off but love
that Michael it's my old body products
would have to be the sun labs tanning
lotion it smells like cherries it's
really nice it gives a really really
nice tan doesn't make you look orange at
all and I'm really low on it so I'm
going to have to rebuy a new one very
soon but definitely try this out I only
have one gold metal hair product and it
is the Aussie three minute miracle deep
conditioner honestly my mom and I have
gone through like five bottles of this
stuff we both loved it so much I love
how it just squeezes out from the bottom
and it smells so good and it makes my
hair really really soft and shiny
feeling and yeah love this so much so
last but not least my favorite gold
metal brushes would obviously have to be
Sigma brushes everybody loves these
they're honestly very very good quality
brush is very comparable to mac brushes
so I've heard I don't own any mac
brushes because I think they're really
expensive but these are a great
alternative I love the little um like
thing they come with it's great for
traveling and these are just a couple of
my sigma brushes that i have but i will
have the Sigma website link down below
just in case if you guys want to try
them out I'll have that down below and
that concludes all of my gold metal
beauty products so now on to the fun
