sorry that my butt is kind of unmade in
the back but um I just got back from
shopping so of course I wanted to make a
Hollinger guess what I got and total I
think I got like 11 things I don't know
but yeah so I'm just gonna get right
into it so the first thing I got was
from Abercrombie this is just like the
kids one just because everybody but it
doesn't really like have anything and
this is really simple but I got a light
gray v-neck long-sleeve shirt because I
barely have any long-sleeve shirts I
probably have like three total I don't
know why but I was never really a big
fan of like long-sleeve shirts and it's
just gray and then it says you know
Abercrombie on the sleeve and it's
really simple but it's like you and this
is an extra extra large well I'm an
extra large in Abercrombie and it was
originally 17 woah 1590 but the store
was having like a 50% off deal so I got
it for like seven bucks so next we
stopped by Aeropostale and I just got
two things I'm
do not shop at air castle but the only
thing that I really love from there is
like their bathing suits but I also love
their camisoles or camis or undershirts
or whatever you want to call them just
because they fit like really nice and
stuff and I got two striped ones and how
much were they these were like I paid
like three or four dollars for them but
they were originally 1699 so it was
really good deals like for three or four
bucks I got these two so white with grey
stripes and Grandpa white stripes so
next I step by the Troy secret and we
got I got like a little coupon thing or
whatever you want to call it like a
little card thing and it was $10 off any
bra so I got a bra and this is the
pattern it's just white with like gray
zebra stripes and then also we got three
dogs with any purchase and mine's like
light pink and has words all over it so
it's really cute so yeah overall I just
spent like 10 bucks on that girl this
was like an amazing deal because
sometimes bras up in Troy seeker are
like $50 so then also we went to forever
anyone got some stuff so first off I got
these sunglasses they're great which I
never ever see us like never seen it
great
sunglasses before so I really liked
these and they were only 150 so then
also I just got some makeup remover
wipes because I completely ran out and
these were only like 280 and they had
rose lungs and keep color but I just
kept cucumber and there's like 30
tissues in here so it's pretty good and
then also I got two fake eyelashes but
these are not for me these are actually
for my mom because she's going out to
like a party today and she asked me to
get her some but these were like really
cheap they were like 280 and the forever
21 brand is like her favorite I don't
know I don't want these any false
eyelashes
and then the last thing Phillips
forever21 that I got was black leggings
because originally I blogged about this
but originally I really wanted black
leggings from Victoria's Secret like the
yoga leggings I don't know why I just
really really wanted them but they
didn't have any extra smalls even in
like some of the patterns that I didn't
personally like they only had like extra
larges but at forever 21 they had long
black just simple leggings and these
were like $4 it was really cheap and
what I really like about these is
they're really long and they stretch and
when I actually put them on they like
crunch or scrunch at the bottom so I
know that I'll be able to fit in them
for a long time and also like I'll know
that they'll always like fit in my uggs
because I hate like if I wear leggings
if I just wear like leggings and like a
hoodie for just like a simple outfit or
something
I hate when your leggings like ride up
and you can see your skin like you can
see your leg and then your uggs don't
like math shop do you know I'm saying
like these are really long so you can
always like tuck them into your uggs I
don't know if you if that made any sense
at all but um these were oh for 50 so I
guess they were like 5 bucks but yeah
that's last thing that I got from
forever 21 so then also we went to like
the forever 21 purely store and I guess
it's called for love 21 I know but I
just got two things from here so first
off I got these really cute sandals and
these were 10 80s so these were about 10
bucks and I'm a size 7 and you want to
know I don't know why we would want to
know that but I thought they were really
cute because I have I don't have any
sandals that go across like this and I
thought these are really cute so I got
the brown ones and then one of my
friends got the black ones so I think
these are really cute and then also the
last thing that I
there so the last thing that I got we're
just earrings because I seriously have
like maybe one pair of stud earrings and
I can't like match them to every outfit
so I just want to get a pack of like
little stud earrings that I can wear
every single day and the first off these
were 280 and they look like this I liked
it because they had like a bigger
variety I thought that there were two
missing in the middle but none of the
packs that had these didn't have
earrings in there so I didn't put
anything in there I mean there weren't
any in there but you just have pearls
hearts bows little birds and like
anchors so I thought it was really cute
I'm probably gonna end up wearing like
the bows the most I'm guessing I don't
know but um I thought those were really
cute and yeah that is all that I bought
I got really awesome deals on like
everything that I got so it was
definitely like a good feeling like you
know sometimes when you buy stuff and
it's like cost really expensive
sometimes I feel really guilty buying it
but I feel very happy and set aside
right now so I'm gonna get it and yeah
this day was pretty awesome oh and I
also forgot that for lunch we actually
went to panik's for us to eat and I just
want to show you guys my fortune cookie
um little nothing because I thought it
was really cute and immediately I
thought of YouTube when I got this and
it says nothing can keep you from
reaching your goals so yeah that is my
fall for today
sorry I haven't made a video in a while
my next video is gonna be really fun
because I'm gonna start recording it
soon and I'm really excited for that one
