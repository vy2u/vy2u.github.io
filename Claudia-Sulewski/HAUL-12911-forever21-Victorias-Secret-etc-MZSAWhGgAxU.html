sorry that my bed is kind of unmade in
the back but um I just got back from
shopping so of course I wanted to make a
Hollinger guess what I got and total i
think i got like 11 things i don't know
um but yeah so i'm just going to get
right into it so the first thing i got
was from Abercrombie this is just like
the kids one just because ever going but
didn't really like have anything and
this is really simple but I got a light
grey v neck long sleeve shirt because I
barely have any long sleeve shirts I
probably have like three total I don't
know why but I was never really a big
fan of like long sleeve shirts um and
it's just gray and then it says you know
Abercrombie I'm sleeve and its really
simple but it's like you and this is an
extra-extra-large will I'm an extra
large in abercrombie and it was
originally 17 whoa 1590 but the store
was having like a fifty percent off
deals so I got it for like seven bucks
so next I was staffed by aeropostale and
I just got two things I normally do not
shop at your apostle but the only thing
that I really love from there is like
their bathing suits but i also love
their camisoles or camis or under shirts
or whatever you want to call them just
because they fit like really nice and
stuff and I got two striped ones and how
much were they these were like i paid
like three or four dollars for them but
they were originally 1699 so it was
really good deals like for three or four
bucks i got these two so white with grey
stripes and grey white stripes so next I
step by Troy secret and we got I got
like a little
coupon thing or whatever you want to
call it like a little card thing and it
was ten dollars off any bra so I got a
bra and this is the pattern it's just
white with like gray zebra stripes and
then also we got free dogs with any
purchase and mines like light pink and
has words all over it so it's really
cute so yeah overall I just spent like
10 bucks on that girl this was like an
amazing deal because sometimes bras up
into our secret like fifty dollars so
then also we went to forever 21 and I
got some stuff so first off I got these
sunglasses that are great which I never
ever see us like never seen it great
sunglasses before so i really liked
these and they were only 150 so that
also i just got some makeup remover
wipes because I completely ran out and
these were only like 280 and they had
rose ones and keep coming back to step
cucumber and there's like 30 tissues in
here so it's pretty good and then also I
got to fake eyelashes but these are not
for me these are actually for my mom
because she's going out to like a party
today and she asked me to get her son
but these were like really cheap they
were like 280 and the forever 21 brand
is like her favorite I don't know I
don't work based on a false eyelashes
and then the last thing from forever 21
that I got was black leggings because
originally um I blogged about this but
originally I really wanted black
leggings from Victoria's Secret like the
yoga leggings I don't know why I just
really really wanted them but they
didn't have any extra smalls even in
like some of the patterns that I didn't
personally like they only had like extra
larges but at forever 21 they had long
black just simple leggings and these
were like four dollars it was really
cheap and what I really like about these
is they're really long and they stretch
and when I actually put them on they
like crunch or scrunch at the bottom so
I know that I'll be able to
in them for a long time and also like
I'll know that they'll always like fit
in my uggs because I hate like if I wear
leggings if I just wear like leggings
and like a hoodie for just like a simple
outfit or something I hate when your
leggings like ride up and you can see
your skin like you can see your leg and
then your uggs don't like matchup do you
know I'm saying like these are really
long so you can always like tuck them
into your odds I don't know if that made
any sense at all but um these were 0 for
50 so guess they were like five bucks
but yeah that's last thing that I got
from forever 21 so then also we went to
like the forever 21 Julie store and I
guess it's called for love 21 I don't
know but I describe two things from here
so first off I got these really cute
sandals and these were 1080 so these
were about 10 bucks and I'm a size seven
if and you want to know I don't know why
we would want to know that um but that I
thought they were really cute because I
have I don't have any sandals that go
across like this and I thought these
really really cute so I got the brown
ones and then one of my friends got the
black ones so I think these are really
cute and then also the last thing that I
got well
hey there so the last thing that I got
were just earrings because I seriously
have like maybe one pair of stud
earrings and I can't like match them to
every outfit so I just want to get a
pack of like little stud earrings that i
can wear every single day and um first
off these were 280 and they look like
this I liked it because they had like a
bigger variety I thought that there were
two missing in the middle but none of
the packs that had these didn't have
earrings in there so I didn't put
anything in there I mean there weren't
any in there but you just have pearls
hearts bows little birds and like
anchors so i thought those really cute
i'm probably going to end up wearing
like the bows the most I'm guessing I
don't know but um I thought this really
cute and yeah that is all that I bought
I got really awesome deals on like
everything that I got so it was
definitely like a good feeling like um
you know sometimes when you buy stuff
and it's like cost really expensive
sometimes I feel really guilty buying it
but I feel very happy and set aside
right now so I'm a good and yeah this
day was pretty awesome oh and I also
forgot that for lunch we actually went
to panik's for us to eat and I just want
to show you guys my fortune cookie a
little nothing because I thought it was
really cute and immediately I thought of
YouTube when I got this and it says
nothing can keep you from reaching your
goals so yeah that is my fault for today
um sorry I haven't made a video in a
while my next video is gonna be really
fun because i'm going to start recording
it soon and i'm really excited for that
one but other than that i will see you
