videos lately but things have just been
kind of crazy I just came back from
Hawaii on Monday which was so fun I
stayed in Kauai for an entire week so it
was beautiful I loved it I mean I wasn't
really able to film or upload any videos
so I'm sorry about that but I did flog
on the trip so if you guys want to check
out any of those vlogs then I'll be
uploading them on my second channel
which I will have down there so today
I'm going to be doing my haul from
Hawaii and it's basically a brandy
melville haul because I only got one
thing that's not from brandy melville um
so I'll just get started with that so we
wanted to Macy's because we just felt
like it yeah I found this shirt from
rebellious one and I don't know I
thought it was cute it's kind of like
ombre and it just says locals only and I
thought it was a cute like lounging
around shirt that I could just wear what
I'm lazy and everything else I got was
from brandy melville so the first item
that I purchased which I'm most excited
for
are these camo like jeggings I've been
wanting army like printed pants for such
a long time and these fit beautifully
they're one size fits all but they're
very stretchy and very comfortable so
these are just awesome I also got this
hoodie and it's kind of like a grayish
greenish color but I really liked it
because it was really thick so it just
has like white strings and it's just
very basic but I don't know I thought it
was cute you know cute color so then I
just got to abandon such I'm also very
pumped about the first one it looks like
this I feel like everyone owns this one
on YouTube but it's just simple and
black on the front kind of has a
sweetheart neckline and then on the back
it's striped or ribbed or however you
call this trench and the second one I
got is floral it's like a dark teal
color with purple flowers and I thought
it was very cute for the springtime then
I got two scarves from brandy melville
and I love their scarves because they're
not too thick and they're also not too
thin they're like perfect
so I got this black one first off and
then I also got this cream one and they
are circle scars so I got those two and
then also I got this white shirt because
I don't really have a loose kind of
see-through white t-shirt like this so I
thought this would be great for layering
or just throwing over a swimsuit or
something I don't know I just got a lot
of kind of simple staple items the next
item I got is the same exact shirt
except it's in this like taupey brown
color and this one has pocket the next
clothing item I got was this white tank
right here and it's super cropped so I
will probably be wearing this over the
summer time maybe to the beach with
high-waisted shorts or something
obviously not school but yeah I got that
and then also I got their leggings oh my
gosh I was so surprised when I saw these
I always want to buy them online but I
wasn't really sure about the quality
these babies fit so nicely and they are
so thick these are literally the
thickest leggings I have ever like felt
in my life I'm so excited to wear them
next up I got this white muscle tee and
I really liked the picture on the front
I thought it was very cute and the arm
holes are super big and open I kind of
bought this to wear is like a like a bib
and then the last thing I got was this
shirt and it just says I love you to the
moon and back and it's like a kind of
dusty brown color I thought it's very
cool but it's also a muscle tee and I
actually bought this for my cousin Daria
so um yeah I really really like this I
kind of wish I bought it myself with
yeah I got that for my cousin and that
is everything that I got from brandy
melville five minutes before I was ready
to film my video my mom came in and she
surprised me with a present and
I was not expecting this at all but if
you guys follow me on my second channel
you would know that I recently decided
that I want to kind of change up my room
and make it more simple and elegant
looking kind of more classy so I'm
getting rid of this print right here and
I'm just gonna make things more simple
like I said before so I've been wanting
a bedspread for the longest time because
I technically don't even have like a
bedspread it's just like a blanket um
but I just never got around to buying
one and my mom found one in anthropology
and she said it was on a crazy crazy
sale I think she got it for like 75
dollars and is originally like over 200
or something um so I definitely was not
expecting this so I'm very excited it's
like white and roughly fluffy and I'm
really excited to open it up literally
got this like five minutes ago but this
is from the Catalina collection it's the
twin quilt if you guys are wondering so
I have no idea what this looks like so
I'm very excited to open it up but this
is everything from my Hawaii haul I hope
you guys enjoyed it it was basically
like a brandy melville haul but yeah I
was really excited to go there because
I've never been to the one in Hawaii and
I just I had so much fun in my trip but
that is it for today's video I hope you
guys enjoyed it and I will talk to you
guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
