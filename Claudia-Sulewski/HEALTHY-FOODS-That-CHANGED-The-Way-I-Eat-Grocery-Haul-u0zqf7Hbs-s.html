as I was grocery carting through Trader
Joe's yesterday I realized how
passionate I feel about food I have
specific foods that I like to buy every
single time I go and a lot of healthy
foods that kind of change the way I eat
so essentially this is going to be a
grocery haul slash foods that I really
just enjoy eating I'm gonna start by
showing you guys the foods that I buy
almost every single time I go so they're
kind of like my staples first one is
almond milk if you guys have not tried
almond milk I highly highly suggest I
recommend doing it because it tastes so
good it's so light on your stomach
versus dairy
it also has 50% more calcium I've been
drinking this stuff for about four years
now I would say and honestly I haven't
bought in normal milk since next up
we've got bananas and yes I buy at least
two bushels of bananas every single time
I go because I find that I go through
these so quick I like to eat them raw
over different foods like smoothie bowls
cereals stuff like that but also I love
freezing them and putting them into my
smoothies or creating banana ice cream
which is where you just freeze bananas
and you make ice cream out of it and it
tastes incredible next up I always like
to buy some organic sweet potatoes I
make these for dinner at least four
times every week I really like stew
potatoes I cut them into wedges and just
make huge french fries and eat them with
different sauces for bread I liked by
the Ezekiel low-sodium bread and it's a
sprouted whole-grain bread guys stay
away from white bread it's not good for
you try to go with whole-grain and bread
that just looks darker with nuts and all
that stuff is most likely more
for you and I just really enjoy this one
this has been a recent obsession with
mine and I think I got Lexi on board as
well
Lexi that I really enjoy eating cereal
and a few weeks ago I decided to try out
the high-fiber cereal does this not
scream most boring
grandma cereal in the entire world like
it doesn't even look appetizing on the
front and I'm actually so obsessed with
it its high fiber at low fat low sodium
low sugar all that stuff I like to eat
this with almond milk and then I also
like to sprinkle on some organic coconut
sugar to kind of sweeten the cereal but
this stuff is actually so good I don't
know why but it's super crunchy and I
eat it all the time throughout the day
next up we've got some avocados these
have already been opened up
avocados work great in every single
recipe I'm not even kidding thrown into
salads your pasta throw it onto some
toast you can do so many things with
avocados and they have really good
healthy fats so all about it I also
always like to pick up some baby spinach
I usually buy two packs when I go
because I run through this stuff so
quickly I kid you not I like to pack
half of this bag into one smoothie and
the reason why is because there's so
much nutritional content obviously it's
spinach but it also has no taste
you can literally add as much spinach as
you want and it will not affect the
taste of your smoothies or smoothie
bowls or whatever you end up using it in
your tongue isn't acquired to the taste
of kale because it has a little more of
a bitter taste then seriously go it
spinach you don't even taste it and it's
great for you so I always buy a ton of
that lately you guys know that I
loving rice cauliflower I mentioned it
in a favorites video but basically it's
just prepackaged cauliflower that's
grounded up for you so that you can just
saute it and make a little rice mixture
let's add it with veggies and then throw
on a sauce which I will get into right
now this is the sweet chilli sauce from
Trader Joe's obviously all this stuff is
from Trader Joe's but this stuff is
incredible we run through these bottles
so quick in our house because everyone
loves them and there is no fat there's
zero fat in this which is great I try to
stay away from products that have a lot
of fat calories out of the total amount
of calories because brain blast calories
are actually not that bad for you it's
the fuel and energy that your body needs
to burn and use up you should be
watching what is within those calories
like the fat to sodium stuff like that
also I had to repurchase an extra bottle
of ketchup because we're running out and
I'm obsessed with their organic ketchup
it tastes so different and so much
better than your regular like Heinz
ketchup that you find in any other
grocery store it just tastes more real
you can tell that there are no random
chemicals in there I don't know once you
go organic you just you can't go back to
Haynes Heinz Heinz that's a grounds
alright I only bought two types of
frozen I am the first one is this
organic tropical fruit blend
I bought two bags of these because this
is my favorite fruit mixture that Trader
Joe's sells there's bananas pineapple
mangoes and strawberries in there so I
love throwing this into my smoothies and
then also this is a newer product but
it's their semi dried apricots and you
can store them in the freezer or I think
the fridge after opening but I or the
fruit stays mushy like it doesn't freeze
and get all hard so it's a really great
snack you just kind of want to pick some
out of the freezer and eat it also I
picked up some peanut butter and jam
start up with the jam actually and this
I bought from Ralph's which is just a
generic grocery store out here I'm not
even gonna try to pronounce that I will
have a close-up of it but when you are
buying food at the grocery store look at
the ingredients list because if it
contains an entire paragraph essay of
things that you just have never even
heard of it is most likely not that good
for you
whatever is at the top of that list is
what that product mostly contains and I
really like this jam because there are
only three ingredients in here it's just
wild blueberries apple juice and Peston
pectin I don't know I know that is used
to just help it stay fresh for the point
is I like how there are no added sugars
into here back that there's only three
ingredients in here makes me feel very
confident in eating it and knowing that
I'm not putting random chemicals into my
body this peanut butter I've actually
never tried before I usually just like
to buy almond butter that just contains
almonds no saw no oil and none of that
stuff but I saw this and it kind of
intrigued me so I decided no not let's
do it and it's basically a peanut butter
flavored spread so it has different
things in here like defatted peanut
flour yeah I don't know it tastes pretty
good oh shoot it has 85 percent less fat
than peanut butter itself yeah got those
too I got an onion that's so exciting
and then also I like to buy some sort of
berry usually to throw into my smoothies
or snack whatever I decided to get some
strawberries because you're having a
really great deal so there you go so
that is it for my grocery haul slash
foods that I really enjoy eating
throughout the week and yeah let me know
if you guys like this style video if you
want me to do more food recipe videos
stuff like that because I feel like I
don't tap into this stuff as much as I
am actually interested in it in real
life but yeah if you guys
this video then give it a big thumbs up
and I will see you guys next week for a
new video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
