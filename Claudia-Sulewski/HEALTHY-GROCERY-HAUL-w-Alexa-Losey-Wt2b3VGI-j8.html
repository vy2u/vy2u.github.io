for some reason it just tastes so good
like feel that cold can do you know what
I mean oh wow this is the best coconut
water there isn't it's so good it beats
every other looks better cuz it's like
not a plastic bottle yeah my first
beverage is this protein shake from a
pray probably never heard of this
they're brand new you've talked about
them but I've never tried them and I'm
so intrigued is this one that I've
already opened I want you to try it
just like insanely good but it's a vegan
protein shake this is make cacao which
is my favorite I don't really like most
vegan
to shapes and this one is like really
good and it's marble and matches the
house oh this is so cute it's the best
isn't that not amazing oh my god these
ingredients are really really good yeah
can you only get this online I've seen a
couple places it's like my boxing gym
sells them which is really random order
them online because they're that good
those are well next up I've got a bar to
talk about and I've become obsessed with
these I'm so excited for you to try this
one because this flavor is unreal so
these are called
this bar saves lives not only do they
taste amazing but what the company does
is also incredible basically every
single bar that you buy that sounds like
a sponsor this whole video isn't
sponsored I'm actually just like oh my
gosh when you buy one of these bars then
in return this bar saves lives feeds a
child in need and so they have these
little like nutrition dense life-saving
it's they're called like Plumpy'nut and
so basically every single bar that you
buy they are making those little
nutrition packs for kids in need of all
of me yeah all around exactly and this
is so good
okay so you guys don't answer to rice
krispies yeah it's delicious
so this flavor Madagascar vanilla
almonds and honey I recently went to one
of their events and Kristen Bell was
like all of you moms out there if you
let this sit in your car and heat up a
little bit it tastes like a warm turkey
basketry and it literally does they sell
these at harvest Starbucks so this isn't
the best thing
when you're like on the road yeah if you
see them at Starbucks highly recommend
but you can also get them to help yes so
I'm very excited bout this this too you
can also get at Starbucks so this is my
favorite might get that at Starbucks yes
they sell these at Starbucks now so just
amazing this is looks like blood right
yeah this is amazing there's 14 grams of
protein well my favorite is the almond
butter so these are just the perfect
parts they're really really really good
I feel like I gotta talk about these yes
all right every single game night every
single girls night you don't know I will
give full credit to Lauren Elizabeth for
bringing these into all of our lives
honestly this simple Mills farmhouse
cheddar almond flour crackers these are
basically healthy cheez-its
there's barely any ingredients like that
is the number one in it you should be
looking at and the order that they're in
as well not in seed flour blends tapioca
cassava which is like a type of root I
believe right organic cheddar cheese
organic sunflower oil sea salt onion
garlic rosemary and whatever for like
flavors and that's it they are so good
for you know crazy chemicals they taste
like cheez-its but like a little bit
more on the burnt side and I'm like I'm
a burrito Brianna love that stuff so
it's like it's a little overly toasted
these are out of this world aren't they
insane
okay my turn yields this is my favorite
snack of all time it's very full it is
cherry and when I saw these in Whole
Foods I freaked out was a Claudia I love
cherry I love wearing cherry print I
love my cherry
mmm-hmm I really want to talk about
these tortillas because they are oh
there it is sweet Finn pokey we're gonna
be talking about some chips from the
station Breanna ladies on the back I
know I know it says embarrassing family
photo and that's like the family who
started the company yeah so cute my
friend Camille she's a huge health nut
and she's obsessed with this brand si si
they have really good chips that allow
she's gonna bring up they just make like
grain free products and these are two
different types of tortillas they're
incredible I need you to try just one
right now I'm really excited about this
brand there's four ingredients in this
this is amazing does it taste like a
crepe put some banana slices in there
some cinnamon I've actually like I've
put coconut oil on these cinnamon a
little bit of coconut sugar toast it up
a little bit it's so good yeah these are
amazing mm-hmm this one is the cassava
and Chia tortillas so it's got a little
more grit to it it's not as sweet so
this one's really good for like you
actually want to make like a tortilla
with veggies and chicken City and I
exactly like those with this - oh wow
that is a great concept as well we have
like a limitless idea so this is the
siete Greentree tortilla chips
ingredients are pretty transparent you
got the cute family on the back I have
my bag this is closed bag I oh my god
I've eat me so much of the bag it's
embarrassing anyone they're so amazing
unfortunately our favorite flavor was
not in stock because that is how
everyone know that not too late these
are the wine ones made with avocado oil
but the nacho flavor is on real and
clearly the rest of los angeles agrees
because there were not there was none
i'm going to talk about all the milks
it's the Khalifa farms
toasted coconut coconut almond milk lend
and in general this is my favorite brand
for coconut milk because it's so so
creamy and the rich flavor worked so
well with like everything that I use
milk for delicious wonderful but what I
mix that with is this which this is
honestly kind of hard to find I buy a
lot of memories
yeah it's the true cacao Mutulu Valley
Naturals protein powder this is what
Erewhon uses in all their smoothies
I bought that there and they make the
most amazing Smitty's try some of it
later to mix it with that it's like to
die for I throw in like some almond
butter
I love chopped liver protein I'm going
through these right now literally if you
guys wanna watch my last video what I
eat in a day I show you guys how I make
my little chocolate proteins minis um
another beverage because I told you
we've got lots of beverages we got a
Space Mountain
I love sparkling water it's so great I
love like having people over and doing
dinners or whatever and I feel like
sparkling water is such a cute like Oh
would you like a pear or like a like
we're done you roommates and you still
offer me on the Kroy oh it's time I come
here exactly I'm going through a phase
right now
I'm sorry Lacroix I love you but I'm
taking a pause on you real quick the
Perrier sparkling natural mineral water
is so good every single flavors
delicious I'm sure you guys peach which
is my favorite one this is also really
nice to make like light cocktails with
yes absolutely
you've said it like uncle Tito's a
little bit that cost me goes align my
leaves we're ready for summer I tried to
pick bars that are easier to find
because like I already feel bad drying
in the apprai guys gotta get online this
is the Omega chocolate mint and this
tastes like Girl Scout Pitman's like I
want you to know I know and it's not bad
that get smoothie I keep those ones in
my cards they don't melt too bad I know
like where have they been on your life
whoa I know it's my grass-fed whey
protein bar that's the only thing is its
whey protein so I'm not crazy about that
but if that's something that doesn't
bother you
I've got one more snacky tightening and
in the other two or in different
categories good bikes raw organic vegan
coconut brownie bites there's barely
anything in these it's just coconut
flakes cocoa powder maple syrup coconut
oil Himalayan pink salt and vanilla
powder they're so good you could
honestly make weeks at home I'm just
gonna go through all these really quick
no I'll do the veggies okay there you go
yeah I always have broccoli and carrots
in my fridge because I like to just
roast chicken and then roast some
veggies so these are kind of the easiest
thing to just throw on the pan with the
veggies so some olive oil on it but some
seasoning on so these are always there
and then I also get these to dip in my
Thomas great oh that I purpose I've
never tried this hummus before but the
reason why yeah the reason why I picked
it up is because Thomas has a lot of oil
in it it's usually like the second
ingredient and people always say like
try to find hummus that's oil-free and
this one I know oil-free original hummus
let's take a little dipper wonderful
amazing snack it's not overpowering got
a nice little like kind of spice to it
medjool dates tell them tell them what
you do go so is my hack that I turned
you on to I basically cut up the dates I
picked them throw the seed out and then
I replace it with almond butter and you
put them in the freezer and you take
them out and it's literally a Snickers
bar you guys it's insane people call
them nature's caramel yes so true it has
like it like a caramel a rich my
favorite snack I love bringing them to
parties and then you can also put
walnuts in them and big men Lauren does
that I can take one more thing I have
one more thing - oh my god that's so
burger the rebels key and I planted a
lot of things just like good student Lee
I just realized we got the same brand
cuz yeah I mean when she is my favorite
I've never tried this one but I'm
obsessed with that one I've been
drinking this flavor of tea for probably
like four years now so good and I love
tea and like a tea connoisseur if you
ask anybody I had like a pantry full of
tea and I always keep on relying this
ones it's white tea with fragrant
rosebuds literally it's so calming it's
the best and literally tastes like roses
but like in a good way
this is the first time I'm getting this
tea but it's also new me
and they have like a line of teas that
they had like one word to describe all
of them and I chose presents because the
flavors sounded really good but it's
mellow and cooling bamboo leaves meat
fresh mint and lemon grass mmm doesn't
that sound like a good time
sounds like a really good oh my gosh
that smells so relaxing this is one of
my eyes this smells like my deep breathe
roll-on oil that I put on my neck when I
go to bed I would be really good for
like when you're with your crystals yeah
and you're like giving them a bath
outside and do it in the moonlight in
the foam in of mine all right you guys I
