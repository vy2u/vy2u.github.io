school video are you guys excited to be
going back to school let me know down
below
I have no opinion cuz I'm not going back
to school but I'm really excited about
this one because it is a DIY and I'm so
happy with how it turned out as you guys
know I'm not really the type of youtuber
to film DIYs and make them crazy
colorful and all that stuff because
that's just not me but I decided to
bring together the DIY concept and kind
of make it my own and I'm so happy with
it today I will be showing you guys how
I created this little DIY organizational
planning board it's so cute
oh my god I'm so happy with it so it's
basically a daily and weekly planner to
help schedule out your life and make
sure that you are on top of things the
best part about this is that you can
erase whatever you wrote because you can
use dry erase markers on it if you guys
want to see how I created this little
DIY planner then keep on watching the
first thing you'll be needing is any
glass photo frame whatever size and
color you want some scrapbook paper and
really any decorative supplies that you
want like letters and papers and
stickers motivational stickers all that
stuff washi tape I got mine from
Michaels and the first thing you want to
do is to take the photo frame out of its
packaging and we're going to be using
one of the pieces of paper that came
with the frame as our foundation so I'm
just matching up my white brick
scrapbook paper to use as the background
for my planner at the top of my page I
wanted to write a little motivational
message so using some black larger
letters I'm writing make today count and
then on the bottom left hand corner I
wanted to leave a space for my daily
to-do list the things that I want to do
on a daily basis and then on the right
side I'm making my weekly calendar so
using these really pretty gold letters
I'm writing out the days of the week and
then with this honeycombed patterned
scrapbook paper I'm using it to make
little panels to kind of help organize
all of the days and that's what I will
essentially be writing on top
of so I'm just measuring out the perfect
width and length so that they're all the
same size because I'm very particular
that making sure that it all looks
perfect
and I'm just taping that down next to
all of the days I'm all about some
cheesy quotes inspirational stuff bring
it on I love all of it and of course as
you can see I'm cutting out all of the
black and neutral tone ones because I
want everything to match perfectly but
right now I'm just kind of figuring out
where I want to place everything that'd
be permanent I also found these really
really cute gold stickers and these
little arrows so I'm placing those next
to all the days of the week for really
no purpose just besides looking cute and
then after that I am just placing on all
the letters for the week days
so as you can see here I'm just sticking
everything on making it permanent to
giving them a place and a purpose in
life and then also on that little golden
sticker page I found these little check
marks and I thought they would be cute
to kind of help organize where I want to
put all my daily tasks next two and then
after that I just pop it into the frame
and bam you have yourself a dry erase
board daily weekly planner and I'm so
obsessed with it so that is it for
today's video if you guys make anything
similar to this please tweet me a
picture because I would love to see how
they turned out also if you're not
already I love using Twitter Instagram
and snapchat Instagram is probably my
favorite I'm pretty proud of my feed
right now if you guys want to follow me
or salento I will have all of my links
down below and stuff like that yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed today's video and
I'll see you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
