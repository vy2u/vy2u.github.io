half the summer and unfortunately I lost
a lot of my videos and definitely one of
the most of my one of the most favorite
of mine videos that I lost was how to
organize your closet because that that
was really cute and funny and a lot of
you guys like that one and yesterday I
was just kind of searching through my
computer trying to find things or
whatever just cleaning it kinda and I
found the old videos of me and Adriana
cleaning my closet and dumping all the
clothes out and it's just the whole
process of us doing my closet or
whatever so I'm actually going to make
an updated version of this video so
today I'm going to teach you guys how to
organize your own closet and you'll
notice that in the videos of me cleaning
my actual closet I look very young
because I did that last year so just
letting you guys know so yeah now we're
just gonna get right into it because I
have no idea how long this video is
gonna be so I hope you enjoy and I hope
this helps you guys okay
so for step number one and this is like
the funnest step to me at least
you basically have to dump everything
out of your closet where to the point
where there's nothing in your closet
dump it on your bed dump it on the floor
I don't really care just make your
closets empty if that makes any sense so
yeah that's the first step so go ahead
and just watch that as mean Ajanta clean
up with how's it
all right so you guys just watched up
everyone so now it's time for step
number two and that is to create like
put your clothes into three piles and
it's going to be the first one is going
to be keep which means obviously you're
going to keep your clothes put it back
in your closet so the next little pile
would be tossed and that is obviously
either if your clothes are too small on
you or the colors washed out and you
just kind of want to throw them away or
give them away so that's gonna be the
toss pile and then third little category
pile thing is store which means maybe if
you have something that's too small you
but it's kind of a big memory for you
maybe you want to keep it and like a bin
somewhere or even if you have a really
small closet and you can't fit all your
clothes you can actually store your
clothes by seasons so for example during
summer you'd store all your jackets and
jeans and stuff and then during the
winter you store your shorts and tank
tops or whatever I'll see how we're
going to go ahead and swatch me do that
so when I actually recorded this I
really did not have anything that I want
to toss or store but I just wanted to
show you guys a quick example on how you
would do this process so what I did was
just create three piles and I laid them
on my bed but of course you can always
just put them in boxes or bins or
anything like that
okay so the third and final step which
is I'm with your stuff so it's kind of
easy is putting all of your clothes back
into your closet so whatever was in the
air little keep pile go ahead and put in
your closet and if you want to put your
store pile in there too you can and
there's many ways that you can organize
your closets for example I mean the most
main key for organizing your closet it
kind of depends on how your closet looks
like if it's just a bar where you hang
stuff for example my closets have bars
and have like level like benches too so
I can just kind of like spice it up by
folding some things and hanging other
things but really there's hundreds of
ways to organize your closet you can do
from point where when you have to hang
everything it can be like tank tops and
then the two-inch shirts and then
t-shirts and then long sleeves or you
can do bicolor too so you can do like
all your retro eggs here all your
oranges here like do it rainbow or
whatever so just be creative with it I
merely recommend is just to do whatever
works best for you to help you choose
your outfits in the morning and it's
just where you can find your stuff
easiest what I like to do is in one of
my closets I actually fold my shirts and
my too much shirts and then I fold my
pants and then in my other closet I'll
keep my jackets on the bottom bar thing
and then on the top I'll have like tank
tops from short sleeve shirts to long
sleeve shirts if that makes any sense
but yes so basically that's the last
step is to organize and put everything
back into your closet so go ahead and
watch that and yeah so just keep
watching
all right so before I enter this video I
quickly just want to show you guys how I
organize my vide on my video my closet
so there's closet a in closet B so first
I'm going to show you Class B and then
that's my bathroom if you guys some
wondering suppressed and you open this
up this is how it looks it looks like
really messy but it's actually not okay
so here I just have some like fancier
tank tops then I have like thinner
shirts and then I have like some
t-shirts that I didn't want to fold and
then I have like fancier shirts and
long-sleeve shirts right there and then
over there I've got all of my jackets or
hoodies and stuff like that and then
there I just have a band of like pajamas
and like personal stuff and socks and
things like that and then I just keep
like random stuff at the bottom so
that's how it looks and I just have
boxes up there and glasses right there
and yeah that's it for that closet and
they're just keep my X backpack there
and then this is the other closet which
is my favorite so up there I just have
like socks no like leggings and scarves
and stuff like that I just have shorts
up there over here
I fold all of my like t-shirts from
Victoria Secret and like ever comi and
like those kind of t-shirts and then
here I have like two inch sleeve shirts
right here all folded then right here I
just have one of my sweaters that
doesn't fit on a hanger because the cut
is too wide and then down here I just
have like some material pants I fold my
jeans over here then I have like this
little bar and I just Hank my skirts
down here and then right here I just
have like all my summer dresses
and dresses that I sometimes like don't
wear or whatever and then up there I
decide like purses or whatever and then
I've got a hook right here in which I
have a necklace on oh no and over here
I've got this little finger circle thing
and I basically just fold my belts over
that and yes so that's a quick little
closet tour just to show you guys a good
idea and how you can organize your
closets so yeah that's basically it I
hope you guys enjoy this video but I
just I want to give away to somebody or
like today we're happy
No oh my god
