hey guys welcome back to my channel
today I'm filming a very special video
and hopefully very exciting for you guys
I didn't really plan it out so I really
know what I'm gonna say but I feel like
it's going to get a little cheesy so the
day that I'm filming this on is actually
February 18th but you guys are gonna see
this on my birthday which is tomorrow
February 19th
this is kind of the first birthday where
I'm slowly realizing that I'm growing up
I'm turning to money tomorrow that is so
weird to think that I'm entering a new
decade and I just have no idea what the
20's are gonna have in store for me I'm
so excited I'm really really excited to
be turning 20 obviously it's kind of sad
too because I'm not a teen anymore
so I don't really know if birthday
giveaways aren't a thing and usually you
don't give people things on your
birthday but I really really really
wanted to make this video for you guys
because for the past few weeks I've just
been thinking about where my life is
going and really happy I'm I'm so happy
and so so so much of it is because of
you guys like I don't even think you
guys realize how much you impact my life
but almost every single thing and person
in my life was brought to me through
YouTube and you guys there are no words
that I could say to express my
gratefulness to you guys and how
appreciative I am of your support it's
insane I don't know I I love you guys
very much right now I'm just in this
spot with my channel in my vlog channel
and just in general in life where I feel
like I'm exactly where I need to be I am
doing the things that I want to be doing
I'm spending time with the people that I
want to be spending with and it just
feels so good I seriously feel like
everything is just aligned so perfectly
and yeah so I wanted to make this video
just kind of thanking you guys for
sticking around for this long and
hopefully for much longer I don't plan
on quitting YouTube for a very long time
so I really just want to sit down
and have you guys hear these words
because I think this all the time but I
don't get very many opportunities to
express it without being overly cheesy
or annoying and yeah I picked out a few
things to give away to you guys because
they're just fun little gifts and I
think whoever wins these will really
appreciate them and so I don't know
giveaways are fun so my 20th birthday
giveaway is going to be a three-part
video covering in my Instagram my
Twitter and a youtube winner so we're
gonna start off with Instagram the prize
is a MacBook Pro this is the 13-inch you
can do a lot of stuff on this bad boy so
whoever wins it I hope that you use it
very well and you just enjoy the heck
out of it
so that is surprise for the Instagram
giveaway since all these prizes are
supposed to be for you guys my viewers
the first rule is you have to be
following me on Instagram my handle is
just at Claudius loose key this specific
way is going to be very casual all that
I want you to do is to be an active
member on my Instagram so like my
pictures comments whatever thoughts you
have stuff like that I'll be choosing a
winner on March 1st
now Simon Oates spamming me the same
comment 100 times is not going to make
you win I genuinely just want you guys
to interact with me on my Instagram
platform so if I see that you're
commenting like I love you like 300
times I mean hey I love you 300 times as
well but I'm probably not gonna choose
one that's just like copying and pasting
the same comment a bunch of heart is in
each photo I just want to choose someone
that leaves a really nice comments or
maybe I'll start recognizing your
username commenting on my photos and
liking my stuff so yeah just be active
on my Instagram you know be Cho I'll be
reading all of your guys's comments and
randomly just choosing a person on March
1st so there's one prize for the Twitter
giveaway and it is an iPad pro and I
decided to get the gold one because I've
actually never seen a gold one and I
feel like it would look very cool fan
my awesome have a little personal
message and scribed on the back so when
you get it you'll be able to read it
so yeah the Twitter giveaway winner will
be winning this iPad pro and you only
have to do two things to enter into this
giveaway the first one is obviously to
follow my Twitter and the second one is
to retweet my giveaway tweet I will have
the exact link to that tweet in the
downbar so all you have to do is just
retweet it that is it there are going to
be no hashtags that you need a tweet you
don't even have to tweet out to me all
you have to do is follow me and retweet
that exact tweet the reason why tweeting
me a bunch and spamming me in my
mentions will not get you a higher
chance in winning is because the way
that I'm going to choose the winner is
copying the URL of my tweets that you
guys are going to retweet and I'm going
to put that URL into a random generator
because there's a website that can do
this and when I put that in there it's
going to sift through all of the
retweets that have been made on that
tweet and it'll randomly select a
username so once that username is
randomly selected I will click on that
Twitter and make sure that they're
following me and that the retweeted
tweet is still on their page and that is
how the winner is going to be selected
it's very fair it's very random I will
probably also be snapchatting or
documenting the process of me doing it
so that you guys can see that it is
randomly selected it just makes it very
fair and gotta love websites that can
randomly generate usernames for the
YouTube winner I decided to stick with
my roots and creates a giant beauty
little gift set for you guys right now I
just having a random bin but I'll have
everything wrapped up in a cute box with
tissue paper and stuff like that but um
