to my channel hope you've been well
today's video is going to be a
collective haul we've got clothing we've
got beauty products home products
candles as per usual it's a lot of stuff
so get comfy grab a snack I'm sure
you've never heard of youtubers say that
one before so I've got a lot of stuff
from Lewis Lewis calm everytime I'm
having a shopping binge where I'm just
on multiple sites looking at different
things they are up there they're on that
checklist making sure I'm going through
what's in stock so a few weeks ago when
they hit me up and they were like you
want to collaborate with the haul I was
like oh I mean yeah so I'm really
excited to show this stuff and of course
I'll link everything down below if you
guys want to check them out the first
item that I got is this simple body con
a black dress and I've been seeing this
styled dress everywhere so many
celebrities are wearing it it's very
on-trend that's one of the things that I
love about Lewis it's affordable stuff
and it's on trend so I can always count
on them having what I'm looking for and
this is something that I've been trying
to get my hands on next up I got a
little white tank top it's flowy and
silky and has little buttons going down
the center I thought this was a really
cute basic piece that's definitely on
the fancier side you can tuck it into
stuff wear it under jackets the awesome
thing about this shirt is when you get
it you also get a matching little
necklace choker thing that you can tie
around your neck which is great because
you can either wear them together or you
can wear them separately next up I've
got a little bodysuit leotard thing it's
all black and it has the choker style at
the top but it's connected and it has
the most flattering deep V cuts it's not
too low it's not too high it's very
fitting to your body so you don't have
to wear a bra with it I know it's
sometimes hard with this kind of stuff
so I am positive this is cool
to be it staying in my closet for a long
time continuing on with the basic pieces
you guys know how I am so this shirt is
similar to the first piece that I showed
you guys because it has that straight
across cut I actually wore this shirt
for the past two days yesterday and and
the day before I did it's got a silkier
fabric to it like the white one and it's
flowy but so far I have worn this by
tucking it into mom jeans i snapchatted
it and a bunch of you guys were like
where is that phone I want to jump over
to shoes real quick because I purchased
these heels and I'm so excited to find a
reason to wear them do I dare say more
should I just just pose with it
I feel like Carrie Bradshaw it on these
heels or something the color is so
pretty it's like a baby pink champagne
and I love the giant buckle right here
on the thicker strap I know they're also
sold in a few different colors and I was
having troubles choosing but that color
sold me next up we have got this
jumpsuit I have never owned a piece like
this before as far as the shape goes but
it is all black it's got a floral
pattern super cute and the legs are
wider and they cut just below the knee
really interested to see how I end up
wearing this but it's definitely a
bolder piece for me
I'm excited we've got a dress it's silky
like a blush toned pink peachy color
very difficult to show you guys what it
looks like but obviously I'll have
tryout shots but the shape of this dress
is what caught my eye you've got a
little leg action going out I love a
good leg that sticks out step out with
that leg and the last piece I wanted to
show you guys is a maxi dress and it is
so girly I'm excited it's white and it
has a bunch pink flowers all over it and
it's also off the shoulder so it's
really cute but yeah I really love it
super flowy girly all that good stuff
next up I want to show you guys a few
things that I purchased from Nasty Gal
another one of my go to stores classic
the first thing I purchase were a pair
of jeans
and I'm so so happy about these and
happy that I discovered this collection
of theirs it's called afterparty
I know exactly what size fits me it fits
me perfectly I can always count on it
and that's something that is really hard
to find because I feel like jeans always
fit differently but anyways they're just
your classic mom style jeans and the
cool part about these jeans is that the
butt pockets don't exist but you've kind
of got like a little died action going
on next up we've got a smaller piece and
it always gets tangled but when it's
untangled it's beautiful we got it guys
it is a layered gold necklace and yeah
this one sits very beautifully I'll try
to find the link for it for you guys I
like it because it's small it's dainty
looking it's not too costumey looking
sometimes they just look kind of
overwhelming if you know what I'm
talking about and it's just great it's
just lovely
I also got this pajama shirt but I'm not
going to wear it as a pajama shirt this
shirt is mint we're outside of your
house on the website I saw the model
wearing this shirt with it a little
button-down tucked into some light
washed mom jeans some black boots and I
thought Dejan that girl looks so good I
want to wear that and then here we are
I'm holding in my hands the last thing I
want to show you guys was a little
backpack that I got it's like a dark
pair we cool gray color it's got suede
fabric cute little love it so that's it
for the clothing portion of this haul
all very exciting things now we're going
to get into candles I got some candles
from Anthropologie because they have
greatest smelling candles in the entire
world I'm gonna start off with a big boy
this candle is very close to my heart
I have probably repurchases candle at
least a few dozen times in my life
because this was always a go-to candle
for my mom so this smell of his candle
reminds me of home we used to always get
for Christmas I don't even know how to
explain it it has a slight tropical
smell but it's still like feminine and
just fancy smelling I don't know how to
explain it but it always comes in the
same packaging
fragrance candle bujji perfume is that
with cold and then I wanted to try two
different ones also the packaging's are
so cute we've got this shorter chubbier
one it's still wide and it has three
wicks in it ah yes there we go this one
definitely smells more perfume II
definitely reminds me of the smell of
like a bath bomb or bath salts so very
relaxing and just girly reminding me of
roses I'm really trying here guys I suck
at just coming smells
lastly we got a little baby one and her
is this the same candle it has the same
lid and it says Makar on it as well
but it smells different okay what is
this one it doesn't say I wish I could
tell you guys kind of smells like a
blend of the first two that I showed you
guys amazing candles are such a great
invention next up I want to show you
guys a few things that I purchased from
Sephora starting off with a hair product
I saw my friend Rebecca talk about this
in one of her favorites videos it's the
way texturizing hairspray not gonna lie
I have been using this since purchasing
it it just sprays out like that
essentially it's like an everyday spray
to kind of give your hair a little bit
of texture but it's very lightweight
which I love so it's great for very fine
hair that doesn't really have a lot
going on aka my hair next up I got a
bunch of eye masks coz hi I'm pretty
stocked up with face masks those are
also great I got some of the boscia
sake brightening hydrogel eye masks I've
used these multiple times and I really
love them they stick on grades they feel
great and I also like how they come in
individual packages I also want to try
this Sephora brand of I mas I've never
tried these before but the worker
pointed them out a relaxing and
refreshing green tea eye mask and anti
fatigue and energizing pomegranate
I'm asked perfecting and brightening
pearl-like they're just it all sounds so
peeling and then the last thing I
purchased was a little fan brush I
thought this one would be nice I forgot
to put highlight on tonight
wow what a bummer okay anyways I think
this would be really great for you know
the cheekbones the nose Cupid's bow all
that stuff so I want to get a nice
little fan brush that just about wraps
up everything that I want to show you
