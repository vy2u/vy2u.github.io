very long break before we get started
with today's haul I quickly want to
mention a few couple things for starters
if you're not subscribed to my second
channel which is my blog channel you are
missing out on a ton of content because
although I haven't really been uploading
as much on my main channel I've been
uploading like crazy on my vlog channel
and also I am participating in vlogmas
of course it's my fourth year in a row
doing it which is so crazy to think
about if you guys don't know vlogmas
it's basically where you log your day
every single day from December 1st to
the 25th either way so much content is
going to be pooped out from me that is
not the word that I should be using
right now uh also before we get started
I would like to mention that I'm very
sick right now the only reason I have
any sort of the energy is because I just
had a 20 minute nap and I took a shot of
dayquil so let's get this rolling before
I start dying down again so as you guys
know Black Friday and Cyber Monday just
passed by and of course I had to take
advantage of the deals I'm gonna start
off with Toby because I'm most excited
about this purchase it just came in the
mail today the first thing that I got
was this super cool velvet blazer super
outside of my regular style but it's
like a emerald green dark green velvet
so I can't wait to wear like all black
underneath this and make this like the
statement piece and of course with the
holiday season coming up I thought this
would be a perfect time to purchase this
so yeah Anto be calm everything was like
at least 50% off which is crazy the next
thing I got is this skirt and I'm so
excited to wear this one as well I have
a similar one from Reformation where it
has like this side slit right here I
thought this was cool because it has the
zipper so it has a nice little edgy
detail right there and it's just super
fitting it's a little bit longer and
it's got that little sexy slip on the
side slit slit slit slit I also got two
of the same crop top because I really
liked me structure and shape of these so
I'll show you this red one first you've
got a super cool like strap design in
the front yeah I think it's gonna look
super cool with chokers and
type of jacket over top so I purchased
this in a dark red as well as a white
next up I got a bunch of stuff from
forever 21 which is so weird to say
because I haven't shopped there in a
very very long time I would say at least
like two years or something I don't know
what sparked the interest again but one
day I just randomly went on their site
just to check it out see what's you know
what's going on and I was very
pleasantly surprised a lot of their web
exclusives are so so cool-looking and
the quality is great you can strike gold
on their website so obviously when Black
Friday Cyber Monday weekend came along I
had to take advantage of it and I got a
lot of things for starters I got this
cropped hoodie it reminds me of the Puma
one you've got like the crisscross
string detail in the front super long
oversize sleeves and the stripes on the
bottom sporty edgy all of that stuff I'm
definitely gonna wear it out a bunch of
times and then afterwards I'll probably
just wear it to workout classes and
stuff because it's such a casual and
comfy fit I'm just going to show you
guys the hoodies first because I'm
really obsessed with all of them so next
up we've got this black one which I
actually cut super short and then I
thought the sleeves were super cool so
they're a little bit longer as well and
then yeah they have like silver rings
and black thread kind of going through
on both sleeves and I think it's such a
cute and simple detail next up we've got
yet again another black hoodie except
this one is more of like a hoodie dress
so I will definitely be wearing this as
a dress with maybe some fishnet tights
and like boots that go like over the
knee but it's basically just a super
long black hoodie and then right on the
front right here you've got this like
little rubber label that says bad habits
the next hoodie is a lighter fit and
it's light gray I chopped this one short
as well but what I love about it is the
bell bottom sleeves they go super wide
and large at the bottom and I just think
it looks so cool and you've got like a
little hood and yeah so so so cute next
up I want to show you guys two pairs of
heels that I purchased from them quick
back story one time I was in a meeting
with my team and
I noticed that my manager Claire was
wearing the cutest heels ever I asked
her where they were from and she was
like forever 21 and I was like no way
can I try them on I tried them on they
were very comfortable they fit very well
and I ended up buying them in two
different colors also because I
purchased these on Cyber Monday they
were only twenty dollars each which is
insane loving life I've also been
finding a lot of cute crop tops and body
suits off of forever 21 it's a little
crop top and it's velvet and sheer it's
a super pretty like topi lavender gray
color I don't even know but I'm obsessed
with like the straight-across cut this
one's a little crazier you definitely
have to wear a bra underneath this one
but it's a bodysuit and it's just nude
it's got all these different panels
going on and stuff and I think this will
be super cute with black high-waisted
trousers or jeans or pants or whatever
you want to wear with them also found
this top it's just a simple black
t-shirt but on the back you've got some
little crisscross see detailing going on
I thought this is cool because a lot of
shirts have the crisscross going on in
front I like how this was on the back
because it's kind of like business in
the front party in the back
whoa I purchased a few other like simple
tank tops that kind of go cross like
this in black and nude and stuff but I
figured I wouldn't bore you guys with
those lastly I got two sports bras from
them and both of these are so cute this
first one I am so so pleased with it's
gray and it's got these little cutouts
on the side right here let me tell you
my tits have never looked better in a
sports bra damn flattering bra so to be
a role model I'm trying it I'm insane
the second sports bra looks like this
it's so cool you've got like a light
peachy pink regular sports bra
underneath and then this black mesh one
that overlaps and kind of cuts higher
this one is super sick I love the colors
next up we've got Urban Outfitters the
first top that I will show you guys is
this sheer one I don't even know how to
explain the material it's like mesh but
shiny it's black but silver I just
thought it'd be really pretty for the
holiday season
and just to be able to wear really cool
stuff underneath whether it's cool bra
lights or tank tops I also got this
little tank top which i think is so cute
the whole corset look has been a huge
trend so this is kind of a subtle play
on that because you've got like the
metal wires within the fabric but it's
not like a full-on corset like you've
got the stretchiness in the back so
you're definitely not being squeezed in
it's very comfortable I love how the
straps go wider at the top oh my gosh
it's just so dainty and so pretty and
I'm really excited to figure out how I'm
gonna wear this one also the color is
gorgeous I don't even know what you'd
call this next up we've got a chunky
cardigan it's looking kind of blue on
camera it is a little blue it's like a
light grey blue I don't know it's just
an open cardigan
that's super chunky it's got little
pockets on the sides definitely gonna be
a staple piece for me this winter it's
so warm it's not itchy the one that I'm
wearing right now is also Urban
Outfitters it's super long and it's got
pockets and it's very warm I of course
had to follow my beauty lifestyle guru
duties and purchase some candles on Bath
&amp;amp; Body Works because everyone does that
I got one two three four five six seven
eight candles but I want to show you
guys just a few of them to talk about
some of my favorite scents my all-time
favorite from the store has got to be
champagne toast
it only comes out during the holidays
and it smells so good
glittering champagne wild berries and
tangerine zest I don't even know how to
explain it but it's damn good if there's
one candle this is the one I also
purchased fresh balsam so this will be a
great winter candle that I can continue
to burn after Christmas as well the jar
is so pretty it's like a frosty white we
don't have real Christmas tree so this
will this will have to do sparkling
icicles has been a classic for me as
well I used to buy my brother this
candle Kevin because he loves candles
and it definitely has a cologne smell to
it but not as intense as the mahogany
teak wood one that one just gives me a
headache after burning for 10 minutes
this one is a little more subtle and a
little less musky I would say
I decided to pick up stress relief this
one is eucalyptus spearmint so you can
assume what this one smells like winter
Oh smells so great um Wow so those are
all things that I placed out before me I
was really enjoying filming this always
happens you guys want to follow me along

great holiday season so far and i'm very
excited to see you guys for any video
