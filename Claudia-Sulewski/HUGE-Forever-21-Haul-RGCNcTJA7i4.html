you know saying anything about today's
video I just quickly want to say that
yesterday I like just got sick and today
I feel like total crap
like Mike's my throat hurts and I've
runny nose my head hurts and I'm
probably supposed to be in bed sleeping
right now but I decided to make a video
for all of you guys because I know that
you guys are gonna really enjoy this
video so today I'm going to be doing a
haul from forever 21 and everything I
bought was from online and oh my god I
love online shopping now I don't know I
just feel like it's so much more better
than actual shopping because a lot of
things online there's like a lot more
things online because you know the
cutest stuff are always sold out in the
stores so I'm definitely gonna like
online shop more than I do normally now
so before also before I show you guys
anything I just want to say that I did
pay for all this stuff
well actually I used my dad's credit
card so you pay online but then in real
life I gave him my money so it's like as
if I paid for it you know so yeah
basically I'm just gonna get right into
it I got clothes and Julie and I'm super
super excited to show you guys I'm like
going crazy right now like I just got
the stuff like half an hour ago so I'm
just gonna get right into it and start
off with the clothes so first I'm gonna
start out with these shirts so a lot of
the things before I show you guys a lot
of the things that I got have a lot of
like detailing in them I got a lot of
like feather things and just like kind
of like a bohemian like kind of Indian
like type of style I don't know like it
has a lot of patterns and stuff if you
guys I'm saying if I'm not making any
sense I'm sorry so this is the first
shirt and it's just all black and it has
a caller right here and it has this
gorgeous gorgeous detailing and pattern
that looks like that and this shirt was
1280 so looks like that so the next
shirt also has really really gorgeous
detailing it has really pretty beads
right here in the front
I think alike that it also has a collar
and it's just black and loose and I got
a lot of tank tops because that's what I
need I don't have like any tank tops for
the summer and this shirt was in 1980 it
looks like that so this shirt is like
kind of simple but I just needed one of
these it's just a white flowy tank top
and it has really pretty like lacy
detailing on the front and on the back I
just fell in love with the back when I
saw it online so I had to get it
definitely simple so it's like the
perfect shirt to add in so kind of like
really long like statement Julie so I
really like that one the next shirt is
this one right here and it's like a
bright orange --red and oh that shirt
was sorry 1380 okay so this shirt back
to this one it has a really cool like
straps right here it kind of looks like
like a braided
material or whatever and then it also
has really pretty like stitching or like
a really pretty pattern as you guys can
see a lot of things I got have like
really pretty like patterns to them
stuff and this shirt was 1780 it's like
that so the next shirt and I think this
is yeah this is the last shirt that I
got and it's just a spaghetti strap it's
like a white it's kind of like like
see-through like the material so I'm
gonna have to put like some kind of
undershirt underneath it but it looks
like this and it has really really
pretty detailing and
and stuff like that and just looks like
that's really flowy long and I love it
and this was 1980 sorry okay anyways
then next I got like one of their nutty
sweater things I have one of them it has
like Minnie Mouse on it or something but
this one's just really plain and black
and it says create peace on it and I
just fell in love with this right when I
saw it I love they're like ripped and
nitty things cuz it's like ripped at the
top and this is really cute for like one
of those cold summer nights was just
like white shorts or something so next
up I'm really really excited about this
item and I've never had these before and
let me just say I felt like so so lucky
because I've never tried shorts at
forever 21 like I never even knew that
like that I couldn't even fit in them so
I was really surprised so I got these
white shorts and these are actually
high-waisted shorts and I was so excited
to get these so obviously they're
highway said they look like this and I
think this is size 24 I'm not sure but I
totally guessed online and they're think
perfectly fit makes us so happy about
these and these were 1380 alright so
this is the last clothing item that I
got and I'm so so happy and excited
about this one and it is my first ever
romper and the belt is just like falling
off right now so I don't care enough
okay
so it's just a strapless romper and it
looks like that and then it goes down
into little shorts and then it has this
really pretty like chocolate brown like
thin belt that's that you can like loop
or attach on to it and the belt came
with it and I can take it off and like
use it for other things too and it's
just kind of jumbled up right now when I
tried this and it fits really nicely and
I really like it so I really want to
make like a half of the day with this
wrapper and
trapper was 2280 and also I quickly just
want to show you guys the perfect shoes
that match with this so much but they're
high heels so I mean I don't know when
the heck I'm ever gonna wear these and
they're my mom's prada heels and they
look like this well actually they're
like wedges and they match so much with
like the belt and I don't know it just
looks really really good and I was just
walking around and it's just so cute
so I got this and I'm really happy about
it okay so that was the last of all the
clothing that I got and now I'm going to
talk about the journey that I got and I
didn't buy it it was online I don't know
what just like came in the bag hmm
and I got a lot of jewelry so okay okay
so first thing is this necklace right
here this necklace was six stars and
eighty cents and it's just the gold
chain and ready for this isn't that
gorgeous sorry I have nail polish on my
finger okay so I don't know why it kinda
reminds me of like one of those dream
catchers or whatever they're called so
it just has like rocks and charms and
it's like a circle and absolutely love
it I love long necklaces a lot of things
I got have feathers on them just warning
you guys okay so next up I got this
necklace right here and this was also
six hours and 80 cents and it's just a
silver chain and then it has a really
pretty turquoise rock I love love these
kind of like rock necklaces like this
with like the turquoise rock and it has
like a silver frame on it and I love it
and it's really long and it's big so
yeah okay
so next I got these earrings and they're
obviously hot pink and these were 380
and they look like this so it's just hot
pink feathers and it has turquoise beads
like that so that's how they look so
love those
mm-hmm so this is the next necklace and
it's really long and actually here I
want me to show you it's like material
and it's kind of like a navy blue and
then it stops right here with a knot and
it has the rest of the necklace right
here and it's so freakin gorgeous looks
like that has peacock feathers and just
a bunch of different beads and stuff and
I'm in love with this necklace so much
it's so pretty and this necklace was
five dollars and 80 cents so next up I
just have some more earrings I got a lot
earrings so I got those feather ones I
also got these which were three dollars
and eighty cents and they're just kind
of simple like circle earrings with a
really pretty like pattern in the middle
I feel like these can match to
everything so that's why I chose them
and I think they're so cute so next up I
got just some simple hoops these are in
cream but the girls white on camera
they're kind of more like prettier
person so they look like that it's gonna
even focus okay don't focus and these
were only 150 so these are really cheap
they're just loose next I got these
little studs and I'm completely in love
with these and these were also 150 they
look like that oh my god why is on my
camera focusing okay I don't know why I
think the setting is being really weird
and it's not focusing but um yeah they
look like that so the next earrings look
like this and they're just metal like
teardrop shaped earrings and they just
have a bunch of colors on them and of
course it's not gonna focus on them if I
go close but they look like that as
these were only 280 so are the lewickis
okay so I bought one more thing and this
is probably what I'm most
excited for like I'm so so so happy with
it ants it is a purse and guys okay so
it looks like this wait so it looks like
this it's like a bag just kind of like
distress like leather bag obviously not
real leather I'm guessing I don't know
it's kind of like black or navy they
described US Navy I'm a website but it's
kind of more black which I really like
it and this is called I think it's like
the front pocket bag shoulder bag I
don't know but um I really really like
it cuz there's so many like pockets on
this thing like right here in the front
you've got a pocket in the zipper pocket
right there and then you have a big
front one right here and then in the
back it has a zipper here too also the
back itself it has like that going in
there and there's pockets inside there
and I really really like this bag
because it is it over the shoulder bag
so it kind of looks like that
you can't really see it that looks like
that and it's super super cute I
absolutely ever in love with it I
definitely have been liking shoulder
bags a lot more because I'm so used to
my juicy daydreamers that I just kind of
wanted something different and this is
perfect so if I don't want to over the
shoulder I can just carry it like this
too and it's just I don't know I'm in
love with this bag and it was thirty two
dollars and eighty cents and definitely
well worth it I'm so happy I got this
bad and also I want to show you one more
person I also got that I mentioned in a
video but it was on my second channel
and not all you guys know about my
second channel which is beyond Beauty
start TV and it is this little bag right
here I always wanted an
over-the-shoulder a cute little brown
bag so this one goes you know it's like
a crossbody bag that's what I'm trying
to say
they're both crossbody bags and this one
I got in Florida and like a surf shop so
sorry I don't know where you can find
this but it looks like this it's like a
dark dark chocolate brown almost black
and is really pretty detailing and then
it's really basic in the inside it just
looks like that and I am in love with
these two bags they're like my favorite
in the entire world
