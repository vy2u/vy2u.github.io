back home for the holidays
and of course I could not miss out on
the opportunity to film in my altar room
before we get started with today's video
I want you to pause this right now and
comment down below when was the last
time you guys saw a lush haul because I
feel like lush haul videos were the
absolute shiz like two years ago
everyone would make them everyone would
watch them I was obsessed with them and
now no one makes them anymore so that's
what I'm doing here today except for the
twist after every single product and
show you guys I am going to give you
guys a fact about myself in relation to
either the title of the product the
color the smell is something like that
figured it would just make the video
more interesting I haven't planned out
any of these facts so we're just gonna
get the ball rolling here and get
started so here's my very obnoxiously
large bag also I bought a lot of things
because I will be splitting at most of
these with my brothers because we all
really love taking baths so this kind of
would be an excessive amount for one
human being but we're all splitting it
because that's what families do families
share the first product I got is the
company at bubble bar if you guys don't
know what those are basically you just
crumble it into little pieces and let it
run underneath your water and it'll just
make your bath all bubbly and colorful
and smell nice and stuff so you can
definitely use this more than once
it smells so good it's pink and white
and it smells exactly like bubblegum
speaking of this bolivars mine like
bubblegum one time I was in music class
and this was right after I watched the
first Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
movie I had bubbled out in my mouth and
I must have felt too nervous to go stand
up and throw it in the trash can so I
decided to put the bubble gum behind my
ear and worry about it later that
resulted in the gum sticking all up in
my hair and I ended up having to get a
haircut that was like about this long
this short I got one last bubble bar and
this is the bright side one it's so
awesome it looks like a little fire
casserole and it smells really citrusy
like really fresh
so speaking of this bulbar spying super
citrusy my favorite citrus fruit our
tangerines next up I got this large I
wouldn't break anything by doing that
this large tube cylinder thing of a
bunch of bath bombs I got a lot of bath
bombs guys that's like one of my
favorite things to go there this one is
called great balls of bicarb
honestly that does not make them sound
appealing at all the first one looks
like this this is the sex bomb bath bomb
speaking of my sex bomb bath bomb I
would say back in like first grade my
best friend and I would give nicknames
to different boys that we would like and
I remember like one of my crushes
nickname was sex monkey that boy has
never and will never find out about his
nickname the next bath bomb in here is
pink it's got little moons and stars on
it's really cute this is the Twilight
bath bomb and it smells very like
lavender II speaking of this Twilight
bath bomb Twilight the movie is not one
of my favorite movies that was an awful
fact about me all right
next up we've got this white bath bomb
what is this white bath bomb this is the
Dragons egg bath bomb it looks like
there's like little colors inside of it
so I'm really excited to use this one
ooh smells very orange e and kind of
tangy it's a lemon sherbert scented bath
bomb okay yeah I see that
speaking of my dragons egg bath bomb oh
I love dragon towels as a child one of
my top favorite shows there we go back
in time dragon time but it's not
it is just never-ending the next one
that came in here is called big blue
bath bomb and there's already stuff
poking out of it so this is really
intriguing oh I'm like breathing in
these fumes this stuff has seaweed and
sea salt in it so it's very like ocean
smelling definitely on the fresher side
speaking of this blue bath bomb that now
they look at it kinda reminds me of like
a giant eyeball bear with me I don't
know where I'm going with this in fifth
grade
or was it sixth grade I was really upset
I never got to dissect a cow's eyeball
and I always wanted to do that we're
almost to the bottom kids hold on a
second you have to turn on the music
it's freaking loud innocence yeah hi
guys
happy Thanksgiving to all my children
this is my mom Giada love you guys sorry
I don't have friends like you know in my
heart are you hitting on me right now
yeah girl with no name can I have your
number
bus patty e bus went in here is called a
bow bath bath bomb it's supposed to
brighten your mood and soften your skin
it's got fresh avocado and olive oil in
it doesn't really smell like avocado or
olive oil but I'll take it
speaking of my aloe bath bath bomb it
reminds me of guacamole and I really
love guacamole sent it for the weird
cylinder tube thing but wait there is
more
of course there is more I got some more
bath bombs the next one I got looks like
this it is called Lord of misrule this
one definitely is a little more on the
spicier side so it's kind of got like a
little kick to it
speaking of my Lord of misrule bath balm
which is green and has colors in it it's
reminding me of guacamole again next up
we've got this little periwinkle purpley
a bath bomb
oh my god this is not a good video to
film when you're sick this one is
honestly one of my favorite sons it's
called the BlackBerry and it just smells
very very ish and sweet speaking of my
blackberry bath bomb I always wanted a
blackberry cell phone as a child but my
father never let me buy one I've had a
RZR and an MV touch and then I went
straight to the iPhone cult there's a
serious question do any of you guys have
BlackBerry's / do they still even sell
them let me know because I'm like
genuinely curious or sidekicks - man
those those are the best
the last bath bomb that I got looks like
this and this one is called piss tea
toasty bath bomb it's a white heart it's
actually really cute it's got real roses
in the inside of it and it's the only
way I can explain the scent of this one
is roses it's just very like sweet and
romantic and innocent smelling speaking
of my rose scented bath bomb my favorite
rose color is white my parents know
where it's at actually every time I come
home they have white roses on my desk
which is awesome that is it for my lush
haul video if you guys enjoyed it then
