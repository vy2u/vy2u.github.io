today I'm going to be doing a very large
spring haul because I recently bought a
lot of clothes and a few other random
things and I don't know what you guys
love watching hauls I love making them
it's a win-win situation so let's get
started so first off I bought three
different things from wasteland which is
kind of like a high-end thrift store but
they also sell a few newer pieces the
first thing that I got is this black
jacket that I have been so obsessed with
it's by the brand cheap Monday and it
kind of has like a bomber shape to it
it's just black it's got zippers for the
pockets and these little strings on the
bottom for some reason I just really
love the shape of this jacket I think it
looks so cool it matches it with so many
of my outfits and it's also the perfect
like thickness for the LA weather next
up I got a B it's hard and I actually
love wearing these under shorts and
jeans because they're super tight and
they just look really good and slimming
on you so this one is my brand somedays
lovin I absolutely love it the pattern
and colors to this piece it's got like
dark teal and some bright purple and I
loved it it's also cross in the back
which is super fun and I'm so excited to
wear this and lastly I have a pair of
jeans and these are by the brand make
pink which is one of my all-time
favorite stores so they look like this
they're light wash and the bottoms are
really cool because it has this white
mesh panel and then it ends off with the
Jean next up I made an order on Nasty
Gal calm the first thing that I got was
this gray sweater and I am so in love
with this as you can see in the front
it's got like this little twisted knot
type of detail going on the model the
site was wearing this with a skirt and
it is the perfect sweater to wear over
any type of skirt obviously any type of
pants as well but I absolutely love the
shape and cut of this
and I'll be wearing this a bunch next up
I got this little crop top I thought it
was really cute and fun it's very preppy
so it's just navy blue it's got stripes
on the bottom and the top and I just
really loved these types of crop tops in
general I love the shape of it in the
cut I also got this little black crop
top and I love the material of it it
kind of is like a satin finish to it so
it's a little fancier looking and I
definitely have a lot of bottoms that
will match with this because it's pretty
simple but I feel like for any nighttime
outfit or any kind of fancier occasion I
could totally wear this just a great
shirt tone next up I got another shirt
and this one's really cool because the
material is really really thick and I
didn't realize it's gonna be like this
when I ordered it but I was pleasantly
surprised so it's not really like a
sweater material but it's also not like
a shirt I really don't know how to
explain it it's definitely got some
weight to it it's a little bit heavier
but I just love striped shirts in
general and this one just really caught
my eye so I decided hey let's add you
into the cards I have one last item from
Nasty Gal that I wanted to show you guys
and I actually got this a while back but
I feel like I never talked about it
and it's definitely one of my favorite
dresses that I've gotten from there but
it's simple gray dress and it's kind of
like a cotton shirt on top and then it
has a little wrap skirt attached to it
and I just really like the shape of this
I remember one time I wore this dress
and Jack and Drew commented on it and
they were like you look like a hot mom
in that I mean I'll take it who doesn't
want to be a hot mom next up I have two
shirts from a random websites the first
one is this floral black crop top from
misguided calm which is one of my
favorite websites I love the front of it
because it's got this kind of floral
material over it and love of love tops
like this so looks like that next up I
got this top from go Jane calm
and I just thought this shirt screamed
springtime obviously because the bright
colors in the floral I really like the
kind of teardrop shaped
mesh that it has on it I just thought it
was like a fun little blue shirt that
could you know really spice up my day
next up I got a few things from hmm
and I don't prompt there it's one of the
stores that I usually just walk by and
don't really go into but every time I do
walk in I am always so pleasantly
surprised with the stuff that they have
because HTM is located like a really
sophisticated cool store where you can
get really cool pieces for really cheap
so I got two pairs of shoes I love their
shoes they're so comfortable so cheap
and they're also really cute so first
off I got these these kind of look like
the Steve Madden ones or vans or
whatever I don't know but they're just
black and they have like a faux reptile
kind of pattern to them I thought they
were really cool so I got these they
were like $24 at most and then also I
got these white sneakers and I actually
recently wore these on a shoot and I
wanted them so bad because they were so
cute so I literally picked them up the
next day but I love the little tan like
panel that they have back here as well
as on the tongue of the shoe and they're
just super cute they're a little bit
more on the preppy side which I love and
the material is nice too they kind of
have like a leather finish to them and
then lastly I got this little bomber
jacket it's black and white and floral I
really like the shape of this and I feel
like it'll be a really fun piece to
throw on to any plain and simple outfit
next up I went to brandy Melville and
actually won there this morning so this
stuff is extra new the first thing that
I got was this little keychain because
it's my favorite emoji I knew I needed
it in my life so it's just a little
purple devil rubber emoji keychain I
think it's so adorable and once I
finished filming this video I'm going to
put it onto my
because it's just so you know I bought a
lot of sweaters and hoodies which you'd
think I wouldn't really need living out
here but it does get chilly at nighttime
and I was also in need of new kind of
comfy more loungewear so I got kind of
two of the same hoodies but also not
really the first one it looks like this
it's gray and it just says New York at
University and I just love the cut of
this it's cropped and it just looks so
cute it is so soft on the inside and
then I got a very similar one but it
says USA on it and it's the same cut I
also got this a gray or zip up sweater
oh okay let's fix this it's the same
material as the other ones so it's
really thick and soft but it just has
little white strings here and it sips I
also got two shirts but these are a
little boring we just got a plain a
black one and this black and white
striped one I just love the material
their shirts so brandy melville is like
my go-to place for really just basic
simple shirts and dresses and things
like that and then I got one last thing
which is this skort and I've missed
another one from Topshop but it has
yellow and green on it and I like this
one because it's just black and white so
it'll definitely match with a bunch so
those are all the clothes that I
recently purchased and I'm so excited to
wear all of them but I have one last
thing that I want to haul for you guys
actually there are multiple things but
they're kind of relevant to each other
so it's like one thing it is a new peri
haunting suitcase okay if you guys are
gonna think of so ridiculous I know that
my energy level is about to shoot
through the roof because I get so
excited talking about this fun fact I
love organizing and just being organized
and having things in order and also I've
never owned a carry-on suitcases dust I
never owned a carry-on suitcase before I
would always use really big like duffel
bags purses backpacks things like that
but recently I was watching Ingrid's
video on
she packs and she mentioned the brand
Eagle Creek I went on the site and I
absolutely fell in love and ended up
spending like lots and lots of money on
their website so now I am here to talk
about them this is not sponsored by the
way I am genuinely excited about this so
start off with a suitcase which isn't
very cute but I like having black things
because they don't get dirty and I like
when they're just simple and you know
black and simple it looks like this
honestly now that I'm looking at it it
looks pretty boyish but I don't care
it's got a lot of compartments in it and
stuff so first off I got the packet
system like folding thing basically what
this does is it helps you fold your
shirts and stack them on top of each
other so they're not all wrinkly so it
comes with this board that you use to
have fold your shirt and then you like
stack them on top of each other and then
you've got the flats that go over it is
freaking revolutionary guys I am so
pumped about this I have these little
shoe container pouches to separate your
shoes from your clothes because you
don't want your clothes to get dirty
from them of course it's waterproof and
all that stuff and it just helps to keep
your stuff all clean and organized I am
so excited for my next trip I'm so
excited to pack next up I got some
silicone bottles these are 2 ounces so I
can take them on the carry-on and then
lastly I got these two little cube
things I believe this is the full size
clean vers dirty like cute honestly I
don't know basically it's a folding cube
where you can fold all your stuff in so
I got the full-size one and I also got
me half sizes
guys I am just so excited you don't
understand it's a great day so ending
off on that weird note that is all for
