thumbnail will see last night to chart
no rap shirt ah I just repeated hey guys
welcome back to my channel like 10 times
because I haven't sat down and film like
this in what feels like forever number
one I would like to give a shout out to
a web series on awesomeness TV called
the commute starring Claudius Kooskia
and Stefan Argus if you guys haven't
seen it you seriously should because it
is the cutest thing ever and the writers
and directors Lindsey and Dane just did
such an amazing job with it and they
were so fun to work with and I also now
have the pleasure of forcing Stefan to
hang out with me all the time which is
really great if you guys want to check
out that series I will link it down
below and secondly I wanted to mention
that I'm filming with a new camera and
I'm trying out autofocus for the first
time and at least four years I usually
do manual because I hate the sound but
hopefully you guys don't hear the sound
of the lens turning crossing my fingers
but we shall see other than that let's
jump into this whole I'm really excited
to be filming this video because a lot
of these pieces are super girly and a
little more classy the first - I'm
calling my big girl dresses because this
is the first time I've ever ordered from
Reformation and if you guys are familiar
with that brand you would know that it's
a little more on the price of your side
but I have some really cute things so I
got two so they're both silk dresses the
first one is a really really pretty
peachy color
it's basically a spaghetti strapped silk
dress with little draping and necklines
and it's so cute I am so obsessed with
this style right now the second dress I
purchased is this all white one so it
has kind of a boxy or fit to it and the
neckline just goes straight across and
I'm so excited to wear this over top
graphic tees that might sound really
weird but it looks really really cute it
helps to wear this dress in a more
casual setting so I'll definitely be
getting a ton of wear
this dress now on to a nasty gal in my
favorite stores the first piece I want
to show you guys is a dress and it looks
like this it's a white maxi dress with
pale pink flowers on it and it's cool
because it's kind of cut like a robe so
it crosses in the front with two strings
and I actually wore this dress to
beautycon LA this year and I got a ton
of compliments and questions on it so I
will throw in some photos of what it
looks like but I love how girly and
sophisticated it looks so I'm excited to
wear this more often to fancier brunches
or whatever life throws at me we'll see
this next piece is a little more
interesting at first I didn't like it
but then I tried it on and I was like
hmm I could probably do something with
this so it's a shirt except it crops
normally in the front and then it kind
of goes longer in the back and it ties
so following the whole feminine vibe
I've also been loving a lot of lace
especially this neckline as well how it
goes straight across with the lace I
feel like everything that I'm showing is
so similar but after this piece I
promise okay just kidding there are
definitely more things that are lacy and
dressy this dress is from Nasty Gal it's
black and it has more of a chiffon
fabric to it so it's a little more
casual than silk but still kind of on
the dressier side and this is gonna look
so cool with shirts underneath it even
like this plain white t-shirt will look
so cool like a choker and heels so yeah
I really love the fit of it and it's
just going to be a staple little black
dress now we're switching things up a
little bit still from Nasty Gal but I
purchased some pants I actually got
these yesterday and I already wore them
last night because they're so smooth and
soft and silky but they're basically
these army green jogger pants so they go
tighter at the bottom yeah I really like
the color
great great pair of pants next up I've
got two leotards to show you guys
leotards are also something that I've
been obsessed with this summer because
it's so easy to just throw it on throw
skirt on or some shorts so the first one
is a little more simple it's a light
gray rant leotard but in the front
you've got the
little zipper that zips down I think
it's a cute simple detail that's a
little unexpected so that was cool the
other one is a little more crazy but
it's got diagonal stripes going in
opposite directions and the back is
really cool too because there's a lot of
little straps and it cuts low and yeah
definitely a fun shirt going back to the
girly things whoo I wanted to show you
guys to bra let's that I purchased from
Urban Outfitters maybe two months ago
but I feel like they're always for sale
the first one which is my favorite nope
I bought these so long ago I wore this
on Easter okay
so irrelevant to you guys I don't know
why that matters but it's a pale pink
nudish bralette and it's got little
black detailing and flowers and I think
it's so dainty and so cute also very
comfortable I loved it so much that I
wanted to buy the complete opposite of
it which is black and they're so cute I
wear these all the time so highly
recommend I bought this shirt a while
back but I also wanted to show it to you
guys also from Urban Outfitters and I
really really really like the style of
the shirt because you can do so much
with it obviously the entire thing is
mesh and see-through so you can mix and
match what bra lets you wear underneath
or you can wear like a spaghetti you
know tank top pick it up if you're into
showing your bra moving on to Free
People
I got wouldn't you know it more lace to
silky things I have no excuse the first
thing is this dress I kind of got this a
while ago and I've worn it a few times
but it's
burgundy maroonish I don't know but it's
so cute and it's got lace at the top
it's got more v-neck this has been super
fun and then also I got this top which
side no side note this purple is my
favorite color in the entire world it's
like a bluey gray lavender muted I
really like this because it's cropped
and I've never seen like a silk crop top
before and the back is cute too because
it's got lace and buttons going down
she's cute
I forgot to show you guys some
accessories that I got in ask two gals
so we're gonna backtrack real quick I
got a bunch of chokers because I saw
these on line two the longest time and I
knew that I would eventually go to the
store and buy them so yesterday I kind
of finished and bought a lot so the
first one looks like this it is a cobalt
blue suede choker
I love how thick it is and the color is
so cool next up we've got this smaller
choker it's made out of black cord and
there's a little bow in the middle so
this is definitely on the girlier side
this one is probably one of my favorites
I've seen a bunch of youtubers buy this
but it's a thicker black choker and it's
made out of mesh so it kind of gives you
that extra detail and then the last one
I purchased is kind of lame and boring
but I liked the thickness of it I wanted
to show you guys two pairs of shoes that
I recently purchased these I got from
Nasty Gal I have been on the hunt for
black high-heeled booties that cut
higher than your ankle for the longest
time ever this is the first pair that I
actually found that looks really good on
my legs and they're just really
comfortable as well so they're black and
leather and cute and that's pretty much
a lot to say about them crosswalk check
them out and then my second pair of
shoes I bought from Jeffrey Campbell but
I got them online at free people they
look like this they're chestnut brown
and the fun thing about them is you get
this long thick string and you can base
you can do so much with this string let
me just say okay the two ways I like to
wear these is by crossing them up my leg
and kind of spacing out the crosses
which looks kind of seductive in a way
so you've got to make sure you're like
wearing it right or just wrapping it at
the bottom of your ankle and kind of
having a thicker strap I love love the
look of that at VidCon I wore those
shoes with this dress I need angels to
be singing behind me right this dress
changed my life
that's really dramatic but very accurate
I bought this dress from Topshop it's
denim and the thing that I love about it
most is how well it
my body when you find pieces that
flatter your body really well you just
never if I could wear this dress every
single day I would it's just the perfect
summer dress that is still casual you
can still dress it up honestly really
really great I've got two more things to
show you guys and they're both t-shirts
that I purchased from the shop on
Melrose which is a like boutique store
out here in LA but this fashion trend
has been going on for a while so I'm
sure you can find shirts similar to this
all over the place but then look love
this I feel like you can't really see
that well the first one I got is
all-black and basically the shirt just
has a huge deep v-neck with strings
tying across and then the second one
that I got is the same exact thing
except it's a graphic tee of a band
called disturbed have I listened to
their songs before no I just think the
shirt looked really really cool so I
purchased it these shirts have been so
much fun to wear out with my friends
when we're just shenanigan
shanigan doing things that the crazy
teens do but yeah that's it for today's
summer try on haul I hope you guys
enjoyed it I always love making these
videos follow me on Instagram and
Twitter and snapchat those are like my
top three that I like to use I of course
always have them live down low I have a
vlog channel which I need to get back
into that it's been like a few weeks and
now I am definitely just dragging this
video on because I don't want it to end
because filming is fun clods
let's end this I will see you guys for a
new video next week and I love you all
