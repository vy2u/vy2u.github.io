all I have to say let's get into the
hall first up I've got one item from
unit this was actually my first time
like purchasing online on their website
very eye-opening can't believe that was
my first time doing it it was a very ha
moment and I want to show you guys these
jeans because I am obsessed with them
I'm not sure what they call them on the
site but they are basically just super
super baggy thick kind of wide legged I
love the stripes on the sides as well as
this like little loop thing going on I
think these are just such a fun like
statement piece on their own so you can
just pair it with like a really really
simple bodysuit or tank top or whatever
and some sort of sneakers there you go
you got a look next up I want to show
you guys three pieces from a brand
called realisation it completely the
opposite of what I just showed you guys
these are super super girly and they're
all dresses so excited to wear them
during the springtime the first one
looks like this I posted an Instagram in
this dress and a bunch of you guys were
like where is that fYI I tagged pretty
much everything I wear so you can always
just click on the photo but anyways it's
a super cute little spaghetti strap
dress I love the straight-across cut
it's my favorites and then the cherries
are just freakin adorable so I'm really
really obsessed with this little dress
realization is super famous for their
little like flowy wrap dresses
not two of those this one is all black
with white stars on it and it's
long-sleeved you just tie it across your
body super feminine super flowy very
flattering very excited lots of very is
kind of a similar clothing article I got
a wrap dress that is like the prettiest
shade of purple but it's just a floral
short sleeved dress I definitely need a
higher net because looking back on the
Tryon clip you can tell it's all like
wrinkly and stuff but once you iron it
it looks so good I would literally wear
this dress with like Air Force Ones and
just make it super casual round of
applause wonderful dresses next up we've
got Windsor store this one's a honker we
got a lot of things I've been getting
pieces from them for years they always
have stuff that's on trend it's always
super affordable so I love being able to
also share them with you guys because

have everything linked down below also

20% off is a very large chunk let's get
into what we got first up I got a pair
of sunglasses and I'm obsessed they're
so cute they're super super EXTREME cat
eyes but have kind of that athletic vibe
to them I feel like I'm always seeing
these everywhere a Plus super happy
about this next up we've got another
accessory um this is the cutest backpack
I have ever laid my eyes on it's just
the prettiest like rosy dusty pink all
super fuzzy and soft with black and gold
hardware and I think this is so cute I
mean this is the type of backpack that I
would just wear with like sweats to go
to the movies and sneak your snacks into
I just feel like me and this backpack
are gonna have a lot of adventures
together
super comfortable fits a bunch I am like
too excited about this that it's like a
little weird
we got another fuzzy thing I've been
seeing these sorts of sweaters of
we're definitely on UNIF hence get this
one because it's so much more affordable
but I got this cute little cropped
sweater that has little buttons on the
front and you can wear it normal you can
do off the shoulder I just think this
whole like fuzzy vibe is so fun and so
cute I would literally just wear these
with like some high-waisted jeans and
call that an outfit next up I got this
super cute little like wrap style top
this choice was a little inspired by the
dresses that I just showed you guys
because it has that same vibe crosses in
the front cute little cinching at the
waist the back is open oh it's so
feminine but it still has like a mature
aspect to it which is why I like it kind
of in the same realm of like style and
pieces I also got this little shirts
same kind of like wrap style it goes
across you tie around I think the red
color is beautiful and it really stands
out and pops this will be great for the
springtime makes me want to go on
vacation cuz it kind of reminds me of a
Hawaiian shirt adorable next up I got a
little dress
I guess not little because it's actually
pretty long it's like a MIDI dress so it
goes past your knees but above your
ankles the reason why I picked this out
is because I loved the rib material the
whole thing is just like very thick and
caught me would this be cotton I don't
know I feel like this would just look so
cute I keep saying everything would
sneak her this clearly I'm going through
a phase but I think this would be such a
look with just like some sneakers the
material in pattern just makes it super
casual obviously you're wearing a
freaking dress so you're gonna look cute
next up I got another dress and this one
gives me lots of like Kim K vibes not
only the color but the shape fit
everything it's also another MIDI dress
I just think it's so flattering I love
the little like detail in lining that's
happening up at the tips we love a good
tip enhancer it doesn't really make your
boobs look bigger by any means but it's
just a cute detail you know definitely
I'm excited to play around with this and
to make it casual next up I got some
basic pieces which are essential to your
closet
Windsor store is like queen of basics
it's affordable but it's on trend
they're comfy so the first thing that I
got was this little nude body suits I
have a black one and a white one that I
wear all the time like way too much it
was about time that I got a cute little
nude one it's got little string straps
and this material is so what's soft also
I got these two and I've I don't know
why I've never thought to purchase this
but it just makes so much sense they're
body suits that are like basically
t-shirts like short sleeve t-shirts so I
got a white one as well as a black one
and this is gonna be really great when
I'm wearing like super like tight pants
that are high-waisted with a belt and I
want to have a shirt tucked in because
you know if you have a shirt that has a
lot of material you're like shoving it
in there and then it's just like no like
you want something that sucks you in I
also got this cute little white crop top
that just has a little like bungee
stringy stretchy straps but it's just
like a little little cotton crop top
like I would wear that with like
something like this sweater I'm going
through a very casual phase it's fine
lastly I wanted to show you guys this
little belt because I think it's so cute
hair with some nice vintage jeans it's
got like a black kind of suede feel to
it and little silver stars on it so I'm
excited to have this around my waist to
do a little thing well that and be a
little rock star at the way so I don't
know what I'm saying anymore once again
if you guys want any of those pieces I
will have the direct links in the below
bar so that you don't have to like
search them through we've got some more
things carrying on these can we just
well I need to talk about this real
quick I've been wanting these van
slip-on like checkerboard shoes for so
long and I don't know why it's taken me
this long to purchase them I feel like
everyone should own these in their
closet they work so so well with casual
like outfits they're just such a cool
touch like you wear these with sweats
and all the
sudden it's a look I I love I'm living
my best life very happy about those next
up I got a few pieces from a from a frm
I think that's how you pronounce it a
from there pieces are so good I think
it's safe to say that these pants are
the most flattering the most comfortable
the coolest pants I own I have ever
owned in my entire life I wore these for
New Year's Eve I've worn them out I
think I've worn these like five times
since getting them and I've owned them
for less than a month and for me that's
like that's a lot they look like this at
the top they've got little zipper
pockets crisscross stitching going up in
the middle and that's how you tighten
them they also have like a little button
they are super super tight and fitting
and then they go wide at the bottom we
all know how much I love wide legged
pants they are so flattering it takes a
lot for me to wear skinny jeans now I'm
not kidding really really obsessed with
these highly recommend I also decided to
get the matching jacket with these
because I found out about this brand
through wearing like one of their suits
to my vs. premiere carpet thing I
borrowed it from Alexa Lowe see everyone
was like oh my god what is it and I was
like I don't know and then I figured it
out and I was like wow anyways love that
little set as well but I decided to get
the jacket version of the pants so
that's one day I will wear these
together and it'll be such a fire outfit
and because I'm so obsessed I also got
the same pants in red but these are also
striped and wide legged and super like
high-waisted and cute and okay we're
gonna stop talking about these now whoa
it just got really dark so much better
damn I'm fist I hope it wasn't dark for
that long I just want to show you guys
these two shirts from our um I I love
their pieces so much they are definitely
an investment it's very expensive but
the quality is like nothing else they're
so thick and they are seriously going to
last for so many years I have this one
like super super cropped kind of top
thing that's nude that I wear all the
time and you guys
always ask where it's from I'll show you
guys some photos I got the black version
of it because I figured I would wear
this a ton yes guys this is a shirt this
is a shirt it won't look inappropriate
if you wear it the right way I think it
also helps that I basically have no
boobs too because then it just you know
there's not much to cover up kind of
similar to that actually but just a
little bit longer I also got this little
cream crop top and yeah they're just
they just fit so snug and I love them so
I wanted to show these to you guys but
yeah it's just a simple little things
that's just a little longer than the
other one that is it for my collective

guys liked the most the vans shoes and
the fuzzy backpack are like competing
for my personal favorite but I hope you
