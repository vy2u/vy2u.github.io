summon animal more than physically
satisfy me cuz I'm falling above
synchronicity in hey guys so today I'm
going to be doing a hair tutorial on
this look right here which I'm so
excited to show you guys because I
absolutely love this look I think it's
great for this summer
it looks very beachy and you can make it
as messy looking as you wants and I'm
just obsessed with it so yeah as you can
see it's just two different fishtail
braids kind of intertwined together and
combined into one so if you guys want to
figure out how to create this look then
keep on watching so first you want to
start out by grabbing any brush or comb
and you just want to brush out your hair
to make sure that there are no knots in
it because you do not want knotty hair
for this tutorial so once you're done
brushing your hair you're gonna want to
choose what side you want your braid on
and I'm gonna want it on my right side
so I'm just gonna take all my hair and
put it to this side now if you have
shorter hair in the front like I do
they're kind of like overgrown bangs I'm
gonna actually take these away because
I'm not going to be incorporating these
in the braids so what I'm gonna do is
just grab a bobby pin and pin these back
so that we can worry about them once
we're done with the braid so just like
that so for this hairstyle you're going
to be making two different fishtail
braids one's gonna be smaller than the
other so we're gonna start out by doing
the small one which is going to be in
the front right here so you're just
gonna grab about this much hair and then
leave the rest for the bigger braids and
you're just gonna start fishtailing it
if you guys still know how to fishtail
all you do is just split the chunk in
half and then you take a little piece
from one side and cross it over and add
it to the other side then you take
another piece from the other side cross
it over and you just keep doing that if
this is kind of confusing you can always
just go on a different YouTube video and
check out how to do that
so I'm just gonna continue doing this
so I just finished with my first
fishtail braid and I just tied it off
with a little elastic and if any of you
guys have had braces and you have any
extra of those rubber bands for your
braces and you can always use these for
your hair too so don't throw them out
you can save them and use them for your
hair that's what I did today so I just
tied this one off and now we're just
gonna leave this one for now and just
start working on the other one so you're
just gonna grab all of the rest of your
hair and just make a fishtail with this
as well
all right so I just finished with the
second one and I tied it off so now I've
got my two braids and next we're gonna
do is get the bigger one and start
stretching it out and just kind of
making it appear bigger so what I'm
doing is just very carefully tugging at
the braid and kind of loosening it up
and making it look a little bit more
messy and undone so now as you can see
the bigger one is a little bit more
wider and a little bit Messier looking
so now we're gonna do is combine these
two braids together so I just zoomed you
guys up a little bit so that it will be
easier to see what we're gonna do is
we're going to be taking the smaller one
and basically intertwining it through
the bigger one so what I'm going to do
is at the top of the big braid we're
gonna create a little hole and you're
just gonna take this smaller braid and
push it through the hole into the back
then what I'm going to do is create
another hole a little bit lower and I'm
going to push the smaller braid again
through the bigger braid then I'm gonna
give it a little bit of space in the
middle so that you can see the braid in
the front and I'm going to create one
last hole towards the bottom push the
braid through and then I'm just going to
put on another elastic to keep these
together so that the smaller one doesn't
slip through the bigger one so I'm just
tying these two together so now once you
have the two braids put together we're
going to mess with the smaller one
because it looks a little bit too
perfect so I'm just gonna start
stretching out this one as well so once
you finish that you are done with your
braid and now I'm just gonna be working
with my smaller bangs that I originally
pushed back and all going to be doing is
just
curling them so I've been heating this
little curler right here this thing is
so old I think it's either one inch or
half an inch I'm pretty sure it's a one
inch curling iron it is so old it's like
broken the clamp fell off but I'm gonna
be using it as a wand and I'm just gonna
start grabbing these pieces and curling
them away from my face now I'm just
gonna curl these
so once I am done curling all these
pieces I'm just going to be pulling some
of these back with some bobby pins so
now you are completely finished with
your braids and instead of using a
hairspray to keep everything in place
I'm going to be using the bumble and
bumble surf spray which looks like this
and it just kind of gives your hair it
beats you look and it'll hold everything
together so I'm just gonna spray this
pretty much everywhere on the braid and
on the curled pieces so this is the
finished look and I hope you guys
enjoyed today's video I'll talk to you
guys very soon for another one and
that's it bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
