make sure you have no knots
also never forget to use a heat
protector to keep the heat from damaging
your hair
for this tutorial you're going to have
to part your hair down the middle
to curl my hair i'm using my large
clipless curling iron from Hot Tools on
the medium setting and I'm just going to
curl the bottom portions of my hair I
also want my curls to be softer so I'm
only going to leave it on for one second
once i'm done curling
you
also make sure you're curling your hair
away from your face
rather than brushing out our curls we're
just going to separate them with our
fingers because we want this look to
look PC but not too perfect
instead of using a hairspray I'm going
to use my beach spray and just spray
this in at the bottom and scrunch it out
to start your braided headpiece all
you're going to do is grab a small
section in the front of your head so as
you can see I took about that much and
you're just going to start making a
normal braid all the way down to the end
once you've reached the end of your
braid it just tie it off with a clear
elastic choose a side section that is
similar to the one that you just did and
start braiding away from your face
once again it just type your braid once
you're done
now that you've done at the middle and
side braid you're just going to do the
same exact thing on the other side
once you've got your three braids you're
just going to twist them together pull
out the elastics and tie them together
with one
to cover up the air tie you can grab a
little clip flower like this I got mine
from forever 21 and you can just cover
it up
the last step is to grab your favorite
hair spray and just spray down the
braids to ensure that there are no
flyways
and you are now finished with the look
it is very very simple as you can see
but it's also very unique</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
