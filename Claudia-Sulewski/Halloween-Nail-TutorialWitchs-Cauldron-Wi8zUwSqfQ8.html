i'm using essie's licorice depending on
its thickness you're going to apply on
two to three coats on all of your nails
except for your ring finger and your
thumb because on these two fingers were
only going to apply on one coat to make
sure that our design doesn't end up
getting too thick
after you've let your nails completely
dry you're going to need a white nail
polish and a cosmetic sponge to create
the smoke on our nails so all you're
going to do is just apply it on to the
top half of both of your nails
going back in with that same black nail
polish you are just going to paint the
bottom half of both of your nails to
create the witch's cauldron
once you're done at your nails should
look a little something like this then
after that you're going to need a lime
green nail polish I'm using innocent by
sinful colors and using any nail art
tool or a toothpick you're going to
start creating a line at the top of the
black this color is going to represent
whatever is in the cauldron so you can
definitely change it up but I thought
that the lime green looked really good
so I just did that to both of my nails
after that you want to grab any gray
nail polish i'm using china glazes
recycle and using a toothpick i'm just
going to create some details on the
coldren to make it look more realistic
so i'm starting out by drawing two
horizontal lines underneath the green
one i'm also creating a handle on the
cauldron by creating a circle underneath
the second line
so mine turned out like this now after
that I'm going to grab a nail art pen
and I got this one from sally hansen in
the shade black and we're going to use
this to outline the smoke on our nails
so I'm just creating little squiggles
about three on each nail and then I'm
going to shade in at the background
black
you
I definitely recommend using a nail art
pen because it makes it so much easier
to create the smoke so after that you're
just going to need an orange and yellow
nail polish to create the flames on your
nail so starting out with the orange I'm
going to create some flames on the tip
of my ring finger and then going in with
the yellow I'm just going to apply some
on top to make it look more realistic
and kind of detailed so that is how that
finger turned out once you've completed
that you can clean up your nails by
dipping a q-tip into nail-polish remover
and just cleaning up anywhere around the
nail that you got nail polish
and last but not least just grab your
favorite top coat mine is from OPI and
I'm just applying on a few coats to
every single nail that is it first day's
video I hope you guys enjoyed it and
I'll see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
