return a pair of shoes so since I was at
the mall I did do a little bit of
shopping but I really do love what I got
so I wanted to haul it for you guys and
you guys seem to really like my health
videos hopefully so that's why I decided
that I wanted to film a haul video today
so starting off with H&amp;amp;M I just got one
thing and I've been wanting a fur vest
for the longest time ever but I never
seemed to find like the perfect one but
when I saw this vest I completely fell
in love it was 30 4.95 and it's like a
cream white fast fur vest it's very soft
and nice and I love it so much I think
I'm gonna get a brown one too at one
point but I don't know I'm just really
picky about fur vests so I was really
happy that I found this at H&amp;amp;M then I
got a bunch of clothing from forever 21
the first thing that I got from there is
this military jacket and this is like
the cutest jacket I've ever seen it I
like freaked out when I saw but it's
like this army green in color so it kind
of has like that military style it also
sent just a little bit at the waist so
it looks really really nice on I also
really love the black faux leather
sleeves on here that is a super big
trend right now and this jacket was 39
AV then I got this great t-shirt with a
pocket on the side and it's kind of like
a faded see-through grey I thought it'd
be really nice just staple piece to wear
with a bunch of different things you
know a scarf or lei or whatever and I
don't know how much this was because I
already took off the tag but it wasn't
that expensive
and then the next shirt I got I really
liked um it looks like this it's a white
shirt and then it just has army green
tie-dye on the sides and it also has
like a bronze zipper on the back so I
thought that was a really nice touch
so whoops yeah that's what this one
looks like and it was 1480 then I also
got this little cream crochet skirt
and obviously I will be wearing this for
a very long time but it was $22 and it
fit really nicely so I've always wanted
like some sort of cream skirt or cream
shorts I don't know it's like a pretty
big trend last year but yeah I thought
this is really cute and I'm very excited
to wear that over the summertime the
next shirt that I got reminds me a lot
of American Apparel it's like this
little gray crop top and it has a very
high neckline almost like a turtleneck
like a little baby one and I thought it
was just so cute you can wear this with
so many things because it's so simple so
for example I wear this with like
high-waisted jeans shorts and no you
could throw on necklace or put on like a
light scarf or something so I think this
shirt will be very fun to style with
just because you know you can use it in
so many different ways and then the next
shirt that I got from forever 21 it was
this black and red like plaid flannel
and I actually got this for a video that
I want to film later on this year
probably during the summer time because
you guys will see but I want your guys's
opinion because on the back I don't know
if you can see this but there are like
sequins on some of the squares and I'm
not really sure if I'm loving that so
comment below and tell me if you guys
think I should like cut those off
because easily I can just like cut off
the extra thread that they're on so I
don't know if I like it but it's it's
not on the entire shirt it's just on the
back and kind of on the shoulders but
it's just your basic red flannel the
last thing I got from forever 21 was
this light wash button-up denim shirt
and I love this I wore it last night and
I've been looking for like a light
washed denim button-up shirt for the
longest time and I don't know I just I
never loved any of the ones that I saw
but when I saw this one I freaked out it
was like the only one on the rack and
I'm pretty sure it's a large oh no it's
a medium but it fits so nicely it has
like the long sleeves that like button
up right here it has pockets and it's
from the life in progress line which I
really
the clothing from that collection
because they're always really nice
quality and I don't know I just like it
the last story I went to was American
Apparel and I just got a few things so
the first two are very basic but
strangely enough I've been wanting this
for like the longest time
it's basically a white shirt but it's
super long so it's like a dress and I
love it because it's so like baggy this
would be perfect with like an open up
flannel and just like converse or
something I think this is so cute for
the summertime it's literally just like
an extra-long white tea so I'm so
excited to wear any sense of dress and
stuff like that so I got that and then I
also got this little crop top because
you know you can never have too many
crop tops from the summertime it's just
white and has a pocket and I'm pretty
sure Miley Cyrus own sister as well
because I stalk her life because I'm
obsessed with her um
style so yeah she owns his shirt so I
felt really cool oh by the way this
shirt was $26 then I also got this black
beanie it's really nice quality I think
it was like 20 bucks but it's very thick
and warm and it's not itchy or anything
so I was happy about that
and then also I got like free pantyhose
because I spent over like a certain
price I guess I don't know and they had
they had these and then they also had
the same ones with like the same crane
except in brown so I just chose the
black and white ones but if you look
closely they're just like little squares
and I mean I'm not like obsessed with it
but I don't know maybe I'll wear them
one time the workers there also asked me
if I wanted to sign up for their mailing
list and if I did I would get a free
nail polish so of course I did it and
they had a bunch of different colors and
I chose this one because I don't really
have any nail polish like this and it
actually matches my shirt I didn't mean
to do that but it's like a muddy light
brown grey color I thought it was so
pretty and I've actually been wanting a
nail polish like this for the longest
time
I feel like everything that I've gotten
in this hall I've just been saying oh
I've been wanting this for a long time
I've been wanting this for a long time
but really like I've been wanting this
nail polish for a long time so I'm
really happy about it my nails are super
chippy and gross right now so I'm
probably going to wash it off and put
this nail polish on so that is
everything that I've got I hope you guys
enjoyed today's haul video and I will
see you guys for a new one very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
