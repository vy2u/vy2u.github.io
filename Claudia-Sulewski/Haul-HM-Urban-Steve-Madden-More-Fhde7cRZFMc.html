with my friend Bianca and I got a bunch
of requests on Twitter to film a haul
video so that is what I'm doing today
also i quickly wanted to comment about
the shirt that I'm wearing right now it
says I heart instagram which I do so my
username is claudia's life just in case
if you want to follow me but I am
obsessed with instagram and also I want
to leave the website link down below
just in case of any of you are
interested in checking it out also I
want to apologize for the very crappy
lighting because it is very dark outside
right now and it's making me look very
gross but i really want to film this
hall for you guys so yeah let's just get
right into it so the first thing that i
picked up today were these Steve men in
black troopas and you guys are probably
thinking um Claude you bought black
steve madden boots like a month ago but
those have spikes on them and i really
wanted a pair that we're just very basic
and simple and would go with everything
so that's why I picked these up I've
always wanted them so decided to buy
them today then we also stopped by hmmm
and I got two things the first clothing
item I got were these skinny jeans right
here and they are just light and acid
washed and I thought they were very cute
and I've never owned jeans like this
before so I got really excited when I
saw those then I also got this tank
right here and it was on sale for seven
dollars and it's just black and then it
fades into a tribal print and it also
has like that muscle tee kind of cut I
really like that so I had to get this
shirt then we also stopped by american
eagle and i just got some black jeans
because i do not own any black jeans so
I just got these and they're just aging
so nothing very exciting the next store
we went to was urban outfitters I only
got one thing so I was very proud of
myself but I got this spray dry shampoo
and I've never tried dry shampoo in a
spray form so I'm very excited to use
this and I got the brown one because my
hair is brown up there that rhymed
so everything else I'm going to be
showing you is from forever 21 so
starting out I got three of their tank
tops and i love these synced up so much
these are the v-neck shaped ones so i
got a light gray one a dark gray and a
skin color so I kind of freaked out when
I saw those then I also got this gray
cardigan shawl thing I don't even know
but ok this is kind of confusing but it
looks like this in the front and at the
bottom it has kind of like a black and
white tribal prints but it doesn't have
sleeves it just has like slits and then
you put this over the front I don't know
it's very confusing but you put your arm
underneath and it's just I don't know it
looks really pretty on so i just bought
it next up i got this brown tank which
is simple on the front and then on the
back it has a lower like rise to it so
that was very cute and then also i got
another one of those like muscle tee
shirts so this one's great and it just
has Wiz khlifa on the front and I
already know how I'm gonna style this
and I'm very excited for it so I got
that and then the last two things I got
from forever 21 were workout items so
first off I got this cheetah print
sports bra which is pretty obnoxious and
cheesy but I don't know I thought it was
pretty cute so I got that and then also
I got these like capri leggings and
they're just gray and they have like
pink stripes on the side so they're very
comfortable and that concludes
everything that I got from forever 21
the last thing that I got today is just
a little bit inappropriate but I just
decided to show you guys anyways and I
got these for my mom because it's
somewhat of an inside joke so yeah they
are Queenie linguine pastas so got those
for her so that concludes my hall today
I hope you guys enjoyed it and I will
talk to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
