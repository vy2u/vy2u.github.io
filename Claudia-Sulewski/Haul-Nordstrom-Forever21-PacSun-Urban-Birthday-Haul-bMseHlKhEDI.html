with my friends and I had a lot of fun
but I also bought a lot of stuff so
today's video is going to be really
really long also stay tuned to the end
of this video because I'm going to be
showing you guys a quick little birthday
haul because I only got one thing for my
birthday and I didn't really want to
make a separate video just showing one
thing so I'm just gonna show you guys
that at the end of this video and yeah
that's really it so first I'm gonna
start out with it I got at Nordstrom I
just got two pairs of shoes so the first
ones I got were Sperrys these are like
$70 super expensive but I definitely
know that these are going to be lasting
a really long time so these are the ones
that I got I don't really know what
they're called but they have this
pattern right here I just liked these
just because I think these are like the
most normal kind of original looking
ones I didn't really want anything too
crazy or anything like that so yeah they
just look like that and I'm so excited
to start wearing these during springtime
in the summer and oh my gosh so the next
pair of shoes that I got were sometimes
and these are just the dark grey ones
and I know you guys are probably
confused because I bought some from New
York City but the thing is when I bought
them in New York City there was only
like one pair that was my size and the
ones that I bought had like a white
smudge on it I think it was like from
lotion or something like I honestly
don't know but when I originally bought
them I thought that I'd easily be able
to like rub it off or wash it off with
some water or something
and it was not coming off so I just
decided to return them and buy new ones
cuz it was just really annoying and I'm
like OCD like that so I just bought the
same shoes this free bottom I'm like a
7.5 of these and these were like um $40
or 50 somewhere around there so yeah I
just got that from Nordstrom so then I
bought a bunch of stuff from forever 21
because I had a bunch of gift cards for
my sweet 16 so yeah I got a lot of
for the summertime so the first shirt
looks like this it's just like a flowy
kind of crochet looking top and I
actually saw this exact shirt on Windsor
and they didn't have my size and then
when I saw it at forever 21 I was like
oh my god it's destiny so I like freaked
out but this shirt was $24 or 2480
so that was kind of expensive that was
the most expensive thing I got but it
looks like that so cute can't wait to
wear this over like Bandos or over my
swimsuit like at the beach or something
and then the next shirt I got was I
basically got like all like crop tops
and like summer tops and stuff but the
next shirt looks like this it's just
dark grey
am I talking about oh it's like a navy
blue color and it has a little boob
pocket right there and then it's propped
but then I also have long it also has
long sleeves so I like that too and it
was $10 so yeah so the next shirt I got
looks like this and it's just a plain
white shirt but then it has little black
mesh stripes so it's actually
see-through and I'm gonna wear it a
black bando under this shirt but if I
think it looks really cool how it's like
mesh stripes and this shirt was $15 so
then also I got this neon kind of
striped shirt and I'm in love with this
I don't know why but it looks like this
it looks really small but it's like it
looks so like old-fashioned and kind of
like retro looking I don't I don't know
what you would consider this but it like
looks like old-fashioned so it looks
like that's Bund up and obviously I like
button it down a little bit because it's
a little too high and it's cropped and
then it has a really cute little like
tie right here in the front and it just
looks adorable when you put it on it's
it's so cute I can't wait it's like wear
this with them shorts and stuff during
the summer and this shirt was $11 then
the last shirt is really really similar
it's just this kind of orange coral
shirt and it has like little yellow
splotches on it I don't really know but
on the front it has that little tie
going on
like the other one and this shirt was
$15 so that is all that I got from
forever 21 total I spent like I think it
was like $70 I don't know I feel like
forever 21 is inexpensive but when you
go there you end up spending so much
money because you just get so much and
like it ends up got so much money but I
don't know if that's just me but yeah
then I also went to pet son and I just
bought two shirts so the first one I got
looks like this it's cream-colored so in
the front it's just very simple has
little buttons but then the back oh my
gosh the back is so pretty it has like a
little cutout and then it's also like
lacy oh my gosh so cute this shirt was
$20 and it's also kind of cropped not
really I don't know it's just very like
flowy and then also this one is oh my
gosh it's adorable
so it looks like this and this one's
obviously cropped but I wear a bando
under this because it has really kind of
long like sleeves I'm not really sleeves
but like you know straps and this shirt
how much was it it was 20 bucks as well
but the cool thing about this shirt and
it actually sent it on like the little
sticker this is reversible not by like
inside and outside but you can have the
little frillies on the front or you can
have them on the back and I find that it
looks a lot cuter in the back so like
the front is more simple and then the
back has little frilly whatever you want
to call them but yeah I love this shirt
so much I love the colors it's so bright
and I'm really excited to wear that and
then also is this the last thing yeah
this is the last thing so then also I
just got two more things from Urban
Outfitters and I just wanted to get some
lace Bandos and they're Bandos are
awesome I did not know I like just
discovered them but they look like this
okay the first one is skin colored and I
would wear a bra under this under this
because it's really like thin and yeah
so I just wear like a strapless bra
under this but it's just skin colored
it's all lacy
it's so cute these Bandos were 14
dollars which is actually
that bad I don't know but yes I got that
one which is kid card and then also I
got the same one in a dark gray and I'm
thinking about buying the black one too
because they had a black one but I was
kind of hesitant because I have a black
commando but it's like a simple one it's
not a lacy one but I don't know I like
the lacy one too I don't know but yeah
so I got dark gray as well so that is
all that I got from the mall today and
now I'm just going to quickly show you
guys what I got for my sweet 16 and my
present was my first and very own way
Vuitton bag I was so excited when I saw
this I was just like I don't know like I
I really just can't like describe my
love for this bag like it is my baby
like oh my gosh I don't know but yeah so
it looks like this and I know that these
purses are really really expensive and
it was very generous of my parents to
buy me this for my sweet 16 and I'm so
thankful for it like I'm honestly going
to be using this back for the rest of my
life because these bags are such good
quality they're so durable and they
basically match to everything and they
will never be on a style too so I was so
so so so happy and thankful for you know
getting this and also I've been wanting
like a Louboutin bag my basically ever
since I turned like six years old just
because I've kind of been like living
around Louboutin for a very long time
because my mom loves this brand so much
like she's really got it all like she's
got like the whole duffle bag you know
for traveling she's got like her own
purse she I'm pretty sure she has like
limits on shoes and like other little
purses so I've always wanted my own
Louboutin and I remember ever since I
was like six years old my mom was like
okay once you turn 16 I will buy you
your very own you know firstly Vuitton
bag so we've been saying that for a very
very long time and the day has come so I
finally got one and oh my gosh I just I
love it so much so this is what it looks
like so onto the details on this bag I
got the speedy 30 with the shoulder
strap you can get it without
the shoulder strap but I got it with it
just because your arms do get really
tired after holding the bag for a very
long time so it's nice to have the kind
of the option of wearing it over your
shoulder and plus I'm like I'm totally
more of like a shoulder bag type of girl
so that's why I like that a lot and you
can also unclip it and just put it in
your purse if you just want to hold it
that's what I did I first started out
like this morning I use these and then
my arm got tired so I put on the straps
looks like that has the little lock and
all that stuff and oh my gosh I don't
know I just I love it so much so this is
all that I got for my birthday and this
is all I wanted because this is like a
crazy crazy present so that is it that I
got for my birthday other than that I
just had a sweet 16 on Saturday which
was like super fun it was like a
blacklight whiteout highlighter party
where everyone wears white and I
switched all the lightbulbs to black
lights and everyone just wore neon and
white and weird I don't know it was
really fun so yeah that is it that day
and that's it for my haul and I hope you
guys enjoyed today's video and I will
talk to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
