with my friends and I had a lot of fun
but i also bought a lot of stuff so
today's video is going to be really
really long also stay tuned to the end
of this video because i'm going to be
showing you guys a quick little birthday
haul because i only got one thing for my
birthday and I didn't really want to
make a separate video just showing one
thing so I'm just going to show you guys
that at the end of this video um and
yeah that's really it so first I'm gonna
start out with it I got at nordstrom I
just got two pairs of shoes so the first
ones i got wear sperrys these are like
seventy dollars super expensive but I
definitely know that these are going to
be lasting a really long time so these
are the ones that I got I don't really
know what they're called but they have
this pattern right here um I just liked
these just because I think these are
like the most normal kind of original
looking ones I didn't really want
anything too crazy or anything like that
so yeah they just look like that and I'm
so excited to start wearing these during
the springtime in the summer and oh my
gosh so the next pair of shoes that I
got were sometimes and these are just
the dark gray ones and I know you guys
are probably confused because I bought
some from New York City but the thing is
when I bought them in New York City
there was only like one pair that was my
size and the ones that i bought had like
a white smudge on it i think it was like
from lotion or something like I honestly
don't know but when I originally bought
them I thought that I'd easily be able
to like rub it off or wash it off with
some water or something and it was not
coming off so I just decided to return
them and buy new ones cuz it was just
really annoying and I'm like OCD like
that so i just bought the same shoes
this free bottom I'm like a 7.5 of these
and these were like um forty dollars or
50 somewhere around there so yeah I just
got that from nordstrom so then I bought
a bunch of stuff from forever 21 because
I had a bunch of gift cards for my sweet
16 so yeah I got a lot of shirts for the
summer
so the first shirt looks like this it's
just like a flowy kind of crochet
looking top and I actually saw this
exact shirt on Windsor and they didn't
have my size and then when I saw it at
forever 21 I was like oh my god it's
destiny so I like freaked out but this
shirt was twenty-four dollars or 2480 so
that was kind of expensive that was the
most expensive thing I got but it looks
like that so cute can't wait to wear
this over like bandos or over my
swimsuit like at the beach or something
and then the next should I got was i
basically got like all like crop tops
and like summer tops and stuff but the
next shirt looks like this it's just
dark grey what I talking about oh it's
like a navy blue color and it has a
little boob pocket right there and then
it's propped but then also have long it
also has long sleeves so I like that too
and it was ten dollars so yeah so the
next shirt I got looks like this and
it's just a plain white shirt but then
it has little black mesh stripes so it's
actually see through and I'm gonna wear
a black bandeau under this shirt but if
I think it looks really cool how it's
like mesh stripes and this shirt was
fifteen dollars so then also I got this
neon kind of striped shirt and I'm in
love with this I don't know why but it
looks like this it looks really small
but it's like it looks so like
old-fashioned and kind of like retro
looking i don't i don't know what you
would consider this but it like looks
like old-fashioned so looks like dad's
bunned up and obviously i like button it
down a little bit because it's a little
too high and it's cropped and then it
has a really cute little like tie right
here in the front and it just looks
adorable when you put it on its it's so
cute I can't wait it's like wear this
with them shorts and stuff during the
summer and this shirt was $11 then the
last shirt is really really similar it's
just this kind of orange coral shirt and
it has like little yellow splotches on
it I don't really know but on the front
it has that little tie
going on again like the other one and
this shirt was fifteen dollars so that
is all that I got from forever 21
totalized spent like I think it was like
seventy dollars at it all I feel like
forever 21 is inexpensive but when you
go there you end up spending so much
money because you just get so much and
like I don't suppose so much money but I
don't know if that's just me but yeah
then I also went to pet son and i just
bought two shirts so the first one i got
looks like this it's cream-colored so in
the front it's just very simple has
little buttons but then the back oh my
gosh the back is so pretty it has like a
little cutout and then it's also like
lacy oh my gosh so cute this shirt was
twenty dollars and it's also kind of
cropped not really I don't know it's
just very like flowy and then also this
one is oh my gosh it's adorable so it
looks like this and this one's obviously
cropped but I wear a bandeau under this
because it has really kind of long like
sleeves I'm not really sleeves but like
you know straps and this shirt um how
much was it it was twenty bucks as well
but the cool thing about this shirt and
it actually sent it on like the little
sticker this is reversible not by like
inside and outside but you can have the
little frillies on the front or you
could have them on the back and I find
that it looks a lot cuter in the back so
like the front is more simple than the
back has little frilly whatever you want
to call them but yeah I love the shirts
so much i love the colors it's so bright
and i'm really excited to wear that and
then also is this the last thing yeah
this is the last thing so then also i
just got two more things from urban
outfitters and i just wanted to get some
lace bandos and their windows are
awesome I did not know I like just
discovered them but they look like this
okay the first one is skin colored and I
would wear a bra under this under this
because it's really like thin and yeah
so I just wear like a strapless bra
under this but it's just skin colored
it's all lacy it's so cute these bandos
were fourteen dollars which is actually
not that bad I don't know but yes I got
that one which is Kim colored and then
also I got the same one in a dark gray
and I'm thinking about buying the black
one too because they had a black one but
I was kind of hesitant because I have a
black bandeau but it's like a simple one
it's not a lacy one but i don't know i
like the lacy 12 i don't know but yeah
so I got dark gray as well so that is
all that I got from the mall today and
now I'm just going to quickly show you
guys what I got for my sweet 16 and my
present was my first and very own way
vuitton bag I was so excited when I saw
this I was just like I don't know like I
really just can't like describe my love
for this bag like it is my baby like oh
my gosh I don't know but yeah so it
looks like this and I know that these
purses are really really expensive and
it was very generous of my parents to
buy me this for my sweet 16 and I'm so
thankful for it like I'm honestly going
to be using this back for the rest of my
life because these bags are such good
quality they're so durable and they
basically match to everything and they
will never be on a style too so I was so
so so so happy and thankful for you know
getting this and also um I've been
wanting like a Louboutin bag my
basically ever since I turned like six
years old just because I've kind of been
like living around louboutin for a very
long time because my mom loves this
brand so much like she's really got it
all like she's got like the hole duffel
bag you know for traveling she's got
like her own purse she I'm pretty sure
she has like louboutin shoes and like
other little purses so I've always
wanted my own Lobaton and I remember
ever since I was like six years old my
mom was like okay once you turn 16 I
will buy you your very own you know
firstly vuitton bag so we've been saying
that for a very very long time and the
day has come so i finally got one and oh
my gosh i just i love it so much so this
is what it looks like so on to the
details of this bag I got the speedy 30
with the shoulder strap you can get it
without
shoulder strap but I got it with it just
because your arms do get really tired
after holding the bag for a very long
time so it's nice to have the kind of
the option of wearing it over your
shoulder and plus I'm like I'm totally
more of like a shoulder bag type of
girls so that's why I like that a lot
and you can also unclip it and just put
in your purse if you just want to hold
it that's what I did I first started out
like this morning I use these and then
my arm got tired so I put on the straps
looks like that has the little lock and
all that stuff and oh my gosh I don't
know I just I love it so much so this is
all that I got for my birthday and this
is all I wanted because this is like a
crazy crazy present so that is it that
um I got for my birthday other than that
I just had a sweet 16 on Saturday which
was like super fun it was like a black
light white out highlighter party where
everyone wears white and I switched all
the light bulbs to black lights and
everyone just Ward neon and white weird
I don't know it was really fun so yeah
that is it that I got from a birthday
and that's it for my hall and I hope you
guys enjoyed today's video and I will
talk to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
