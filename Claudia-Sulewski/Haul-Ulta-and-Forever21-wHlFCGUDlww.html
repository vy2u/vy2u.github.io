and I guess this is kind of like a
collective haul which i think is when
you just make a haul about things that
you bought at random times kind of
recently at different places I think
that's why the collective pause I'm not
really sure it's so comfortable but it
actually is because I'm not really sure
if that's right but if it is then that's
what I'm doing today I'm just gonna show
you guys couple things that I've been
recently buying just like at different
times but I haven't showed you guys yet
so first I'm gonna start out with some
beauty products definitely me and my mom
have been loving these things right here
so what these things are is they are the
L'Oreal I think it's infallible lip
color I guess I don't know but they look
like this and I got through them oh and
by the way if you're ordering ones on my
nails it's by OPI and it's in the like
Shrek collection I think it's the blue
one I don't know it's really called
because I painted them at my cousin's
house but yeah I've got three of them
like me and my mom can share them so the
first one is this really bright red one
and this is Beyonce red of course I
don't wear this one but basically what
is what it is it's a color and then it's
a lip balm and this stuff legit stays on
the entire day and you could only get it
off by music an oil-based product like
cleanser or by scrubbing it off with
your toothbrush and it looks like that
and it basically just like stings your
lips and it legit doesn't come off and
then this side is just like a bomb so
I've got this hot red one I've got this
more neutral brown one this is kind of
dark so I can't really wear it either
but this is Linda's beige so it looks
like that and then this one I got
yesterday which is in azalea it's easy
al EA and it looks like this I mean
right there it's kind of like a light
pink and I wore today and I don't have
it on my lips right now but um this is
the two colors so I like wearing this
one because some young I have to have
like a light color but definitely been
loving these these are super cool you
guys check them out so those are the
first three products another thing is
just this icebreakers Sowers tropical
chapstick I don't know my cousin gave it
to me and it tastes so good I love these
kind of chap sticks the ones that like
taste or smell like candy or whatever
I'm a total sucker for those um another
thing that I got recently is in China
best China Glaze nail polish in
jitterbug and it looks like this it's
like it's like not even a silver but
it's like a dark grey with silver
sparkles in it it's really pretty it's
s'more darker than lighter and yeah I
really like it so that's in jitterbug
and yes so that's for the makeup stuff
not really that much told you guys but
yesterday yes yesterday I went to
forever 21 and I bought a couple of
shirts and like one dress or whatever so
I'm gonna show you guys those and I'm
also gonna show you guys how I look in
it so yes the first thing that I got
which is not clothing it's an accessory
are these bows I'm actually wearing one
right now so if you can see that it's
like the silver sequins toe and then
this is the black sequins bow on because
me my friends like wearing bows in our
hair it's like a thing we have and these
were I have no idea I think these were
like 250 some around 2 or 3 dollars
which is really an expansion which is
nice so now the first shirt that I got
is this one right here and it says wilds
child and it's gray white striped and
it's very loose-fitting and
looks like that and this one was $17 so
I'm gonna go ahead and put this on for
you guys for you guys to see how I look
in it so I don't know I'm just kind of
twisting it up a little bit so I'll be
right back okay so this is how it looks
and once again I told you guys that it's
very like loose fitting or whatever so
yeah that's how it looks on me it's very
very loose and also it could be one of
those shirts where you kind of like pull
down one a year um
shoulders or whatever so yeah that's how
I look in this shirt okay so the next
shirt that I got from forever 21 is this
one right here and it's gray and it's
tight on the bottom and it has like
lines of gray sequences or whatever it's
called and this was $17 again and it's
like a halfway shirt or whatever so I'm
gonna go ahead and try this on for you
guys so I'll be back okay so this is how
it looks on me it's once again another
one of those term loose shirts but it's
tight at the bottom and it has like a
circle cut and the sleeves go of that
long so I just kind of roll them up so
let me just get close in you guys so
that's how it looks in the back and yes
that's how the kibitz shirt okay so the
last shirt that I got looks like this
one they're all like the same style I
just realized
so it's gray and it has this really
beautiful detailing on the front right
here and it's loose and it's tight at
the bottom and it's half way again and
this shirt was $22.80 so that's how it
looks so I'm gonna go ahead and try that
on for you guys all right so this is how
the last shirt looks so once again it's
loose and it's time the bottom and it
goes halfway like that and
let me show you behind ya and it's
really pretty detailing right here I
really like it so I have one more
clothing item which is this dress right
here which is my favorite thing that I
got it has this really pretty like metal
detailing on both of the shoulders it's
loose and then it's like tight at the
bottom so I'm going to go ahead and try
this on okay so this is the dress and I
really really like it it's had a short
but you can like kind of play with it
make it longer shorter wherever you want
and that's how it looks so once again
right here it has like this really
pretty ruffles right here on the bottom
and then it's kind of normal here and
then of course the beautiful right here
shoulder detailing whatever decorations
but yes that's the dress I really like
it I like how like the sleeves are very
short I mean not short like loose and
long so yeah that's it for clubbing and
I have two over two other things that
are really really random to show you
guys and they're both ugly dolls so I
got one to put on my keychain and I
forgot their names are I don't know but
this is like a blue one with the long
ears and I'm gonna clip it to my
keychain because it's adorable
and then because I'm actually doing this
one and it's durable it's pink so I'm
just gonna put out my bed or whatever
and yeah I really like these dogs dolls
I don't really think they're ugly but
that's what they're called so yeah that
is it for today's haul slash showing you
guys how I look in them I don't know but
yeah I hope you guys enjoy this video
and sorry I've rarely ever made calls
it's honestly because I don't really get
that much stuff like all this stuff that
like all the clothes and everything I
stuffed my own money and now I'm
completely broke so yeah I'll see you
guys for another video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
