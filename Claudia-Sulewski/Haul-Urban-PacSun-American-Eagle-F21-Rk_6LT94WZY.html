doing a haul video and I went shopping
with my friends yesterday so I picked up
a couple of things plus I haven't made a
haul in a pretty long time so I decided
why not film it so yeah the main reason
that I went shopping yesterday was
because I wanted to pick up an outfit
for this concert that I'm going to in
August and it's basically a concert that
is all day long it's outdoors there's a
bunch of different bands and it's just
going to be really fun so I'm just gonna
show you guys a couple other things that
I bought for that day umm which are both
from Urban Outfitters so the first thing
that I got yesterday were these shorts
and I actually Instagram to different
shorts asking you guys which one I
should get and I chose these so these
are just high-waisted and they're super
crazy I am obsessed with these I love
them so much they were $54 which kind of
sucks that's really expensive in my
opinion but whatever they were worth it
so they just look like that I love them
so much and they're at least and you
guys know how I love my high-waisted
shorts to go along with these shorts I
got a fanny pack yes a fanny pack I used
to think they were so ugly and so out of
style until I saw this baby online I
think this thing is so cute so basically
it's just a black leather pump we fake
leather fanny pack with silver studs and
detailing on the front and then is just
playing with the zipper on the back I
mainly wanted a fanny pack so that I
don't have to carry on a purse for the
concert but this looks so cute when you
put at the side of your hip and then you
like wear it as a belt underneath the
little you know things where you put
your belt on so I'm gonna be wearing
this with these shorts it looks really
really cute together it might look kind
of weird but no it looks really good so
yeah this fanny pack was $29 so it was
kind of expensive to it but that's okay
it was worth it then I stopped by
American Eagle and got two things so
first off I got these sandals which I
really like them because they're just
brown and leather and I thought they
would pretty much match to everything's
I definitely need a new flip-flops so
happy that I got these and these were
$24 then I got used sunglasses and these
were $15 and let me just show you how to
look so they look like this they have a
gold Ram and brown shades and then also
has a brown detailing right here and
they look like this when I put them on I
don't know I really like them so yeah I
got those so then we also stopped by
PacSun and I picked up one shirt and it
looks like this I love it so much it's
black on the back and then on the front
it just has a gold kind of skeleton
ribcage on the front I think it looks so
edgy and I'm so excited to style this
shirt I also really like it because it's
really long it's kind of high-low but
this shirt looks really good if you tuck
it into high-waisted shorts or if you
tie a knot in the front kind of made me
off to the side a little bit and yeah I
thought that was really cute this shirt
was twenty dollars so then lastly I got
a couple shirts from forever 21 so the
first one is very simple it's just a
gray tank very simple I don't know
there's five dollars I need one of these
so I got that and then the next shirt is
a t-shirt that looks like this it's
really weird looking but I don't know
why kind of I kind of liked it looks
like that it just has a bunch of people
on it it's kind of cropped and skin
colored I like the colors and then also
I got this tank I like it because it's
really high on the neckline and then
it's kind of lower by your armpits and I
cannot read the top of this so there
that's what it says I just saw the
lettering is really cute this shirt was
$10 oh and then this shirt was $13 so
yeah there's that one and then my last
shirt that I got is black it kind of
reminds me of the other one but it's
black his white lettering and it's
as where for art thou I don't even know
what that means but I just thought the
print looked really cute so yeah that is
all that I got yesterday that is it for
today's video I hope you guys enjoyed it
and I'm also currently vlogging my day
today and that video will most likely be
up on my second channel before this one
so I will have that linked down here
that will be the first link down below

doing today then you can check out that
link down there and that's it for my
haul so I hope you guys enjoyed it
