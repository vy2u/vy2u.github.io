doing kind of a haul sesh review type of
video so I got to use that review intro
today and everything that I'm going to
be talking about in today's video is
from bhcosmetics I absolutely love this
company and I know that a lot of people
read about this stuff all the time and
they recently said me a couple of their
things that they asked me to if you want
so I'm going to be giving you guys my
review on these things okay so first
thing that I want to talk about is the
88 color tropical shimmer palette and
looks like this it has a very kind of
nice shiny finish to it and this is how
it looks when you open it up the colors
of these are so pretty so you have
really really kind of bright tropical
colors here and then they have more
neutral colors here which I'm in love
with so as you can see kind of this
whole section right here and like up
here too it just has really really
pretty kind of Browns and gold dish
Browns and oh my gosh I'm just obsessed
with like this little section right here
I'm actually wearing eye makeup from
this palette right now so I'm just going
to swatch you guys my favorite colors
through the first one is this one right
here and it looks like that all these
cars are really shimmery and talgi and I
love it so that's actually what i'm
wearing underneath on my lower lashline
also i love this one right here this one
is actually in my crease right now it's
so pretty also i really love putting
bright colors on my lower lashline like
halfway down right on the bottom and my
favorite color to do that with is purple
i don't really know why and they have
such a pretty purple here oh my goodness
let me just show you guys look at that
isn't that crazy I love it so much oh my
goodness that's probably my three
favorite colors in this palette I don't
know but yeah so the next thing I'm
going to be talking about is their 10
color palettes professional blush
palette I hear people talk about this
all the time and
I just want to try it out for myself so
much not so much so badly and this is
what you get when you open it up I
absolutely maybe I should put it this
way i love it so much my favorite color
at the moment is probably this one right
here it's a light very light pink but
has a slight purple to it or at least it
shows up on my face a little bit more
purpley which is what I love because I
don't have any purple kind of toned
blushes so I've been loving that also i
really like these ones right here on the
end i don't know why but they're just
really neutral and it's kind of very
soft looking and that's where i really
like as well so I've been really going
for those two and they're just so
pigmented like let me show you guys how
pigmented this one is yeah that's crazy
it's like hot hot hot pink this is
probably my most liked palette that I've
ever used from this company is just so
good so definitely check this out so the
next thing I'm going to be talking about
is the bhcosmetics bronzer that they
have and this is called a tanning powder
and this is in matte bronze this is I've
been obsessing over this I've been using
this every single day when you open up
it just has a mirror and then it looks
like that so when you look at it really
really really closely you can kind of
see little teeny sparkles in it but when
you put on your face it's completely met
this actually reminds me a lot of the
too faced chocolate soleil bronzer that
I've been using for about like a year
now I think I don't know I'm obsessed
with that bronzer but i recently cracked
it while i was trying to use it in the
girls locker room during some unit and I
was so upset I didn't cry because I was
in front of people but I was I was that
upset because that was my favorite
bronzer and I was so happy when I you
know kind of found out that this bronzer
is so similar to it so that's I think
this is a great dupe for it I love like
contouring with this on the sides of my
faces and stuff and I've just been using
this like crazy I'm gonna hit pan on
this in like two weeks I swear that's
how much i love bronzer so next I'm
going to be talking about to gel
eyeliners so the first one is
frost looks like this when you open it
up it's a very light kind of golden a
champagne e type of color I don't really
know how to describe it as you can see
it's right there it's so rich and creamy
and it blends so nicely as you can see
so what I like using this for is I like
kind of highlighting and brightening up
my eye by applying it in my inner
corners or my inner tear duct and I just
apply this and then just kind of set it
with some kind of eyeshadow that matches
to it and it just immediately just kind
of changes your whole look so I like
that a lot so the next gel eyeliner i
have is in paradise so it looks like
this it doesn't have any shimmer in it
it's just matt and of course it's really
really creamy and it blends nicely just
like the other one and let me just give
you guys a swatch of it so it looks like
that now as you guys can see this color
is so bright it just like go Bam's in
your face and I actually don't like that
just because I don't really know what to
use this for I tried putting on my eyes
it was just way too bright way to just
not neutral for me um so this is
probably my most or least favorite
products out of the bunch but yeah I
mean I love the quality and all that
stuff but i think that color is just
unneeded you're not really going to be
using this color unless for like
halloween or something like that but
yeah i just i don't really have any use
for it so i don't really like that shade
is just it's crazy like you can't put
that on your eye and like you know pull
it off naturally so i don't really like
that so the next four things are their
brushes oh my goodness i'm in love with
these they're so soft and they look so
kind of sleek and classic and oh my gosh
I just love them okay so the first one
is the powder brush and it looks like
this and it's just you know
basic standard brush and what I like
about it is unlike my Sigma SS 150 which
is just very kind of big and circle and
fat I guess this one is very kind of
sleek and thin as you can see from the
side and I like this a lot better
because this one you're kind of just
using the loose powder and your kind of
circling it on your face and I don't
really like doing that I don't know why
but this one when you kind of Deb in
your loose powder this is the type of
brush that kind of helps to like tap or
dab the the product on or just kind of
swipe it on very nicely and softly and I
love doing that you can also use this as
a blush brush if you want as well
because it works too so I think I like
using as a powder like a translucent
powder brush instead but I've been using
it everyday and I think this brush has
replaced to this brush so I like that a
lot next is the all over brush and sorry
just shook the camera but this is
probably my favorite brush out of the
all four looks like this it's just very
kind of short and chubby this is
definitely a really unique brush never
had one like this before I love using
this for contouring oh my goodness I
like using it for like the temples it
kind of the sides my face I also i just
use this this is like my basic bronzing
brush that i use i kind of work it in
the spots that i like to put my bronzer
in and then I just kind of buff it and
blend it out with a bigger brush so I
like that a lot so next is the blending
brush which just looks like this it's
your average you know blending brush
that you can use I use it today in my
crease and what I like about this is
actually it's pretty big as you can see
so I've never had a brush like this
that's really big so it's really great
to give kind of really soft and natural
looking you know I looks so that's what
I like about this a lot also if you want
since it's so big in my opinion I guess
I don't know but you can also use this
to kind of lightly dust over some
highlight on your face like on your nose
and like on your cheek bones and stuff
like that and like on your chin I guess
then this is also great for like your
powder hi
in my opinion as well just because it's
actually a pretty big brush so I like
that a lot it's very soft and nice and
it doesn't you know tug on your eye when
you're blending it all in so yeah so
last one is the fun eyeliner brush sorry
i was reading off a paper but it just
looks like this it's just a very small
small small small brush I don't like
using this for gel eyeliner on the top
just because I prefer angled brushes
instead they give kind of a you know
thinner line but what I like using this
brush for is the inner tear duct this
thing is like a magical baby for that I
don't know what magical baby supposed to
mean but that's what came in my head so
that's what I decided to say but what I
like using this is dipping it into this
gel and putting on taking some eyeshadow
packing it also i use this today for my
lower lash line I just you know packed
up packed on some I shout out and just
kind of dabbed it on there so I like
that a lot I think everybody needs their
basic standard you know little brush
like this that you know goes a long way
because you can use this for so many
different things so this was great so
that is it for today's hall / review
type of video I hope you guys enjoyed it
and that's basically it so stay tuned
for my next video which is I'm just
really excited to put it so thank you
