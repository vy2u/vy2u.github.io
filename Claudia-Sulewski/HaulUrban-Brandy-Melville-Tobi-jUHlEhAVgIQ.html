advance that my hair is just not having
it today but it's okay because you guys
don't judge me most of you problem
solved
so today I have a haul video for you
guys I'm going to be showing you guys
things that I bought before I was in New
York while I was in New York as well as
things that I picked up yesterday so
it's gonna be kind of like a collective
haul so first I'm gonna start out by
showing you guys what I got for New York
and everything I got was from my
boyfriend Toby calm the first dress that
I got looks like this it is black and
white striped and it's short and long
sleeved and the reason that I got this
dress is because I love how the back
looks so it's got a super open back and
I just thought this would look really
cute with like a black lace bra and like
a tan back so I got this for the
summertime the second dress I got is a
very girly for what I normally buy but I
don't know I thought it'd be fun to
style it looks like this it's like a
minty seafoam color with crochet over it
and it goes all the way to the bottom
the last dress I got is so sick this is
like definitely won't have the coolest
dresses that I've ever owned it's like a
dark grey stone washed kind of colored
and it is a two-piece dress which is
super in this season so the two pieces
kind of connects with buttons and I
don't know I just thought it would look
so cool and grungy and all that junk so
I got that then I also got this ring
which looks like a double ring but it's
only one and it also came with a smaller
ring that goes like up here but I
dropped it and someone stepped on it so
now it's all squished and wrong looking
so now I just have this one which is
really sad but it's okay I also got this
one which is just a silver sideways
cross and
and also I got a pair of earrings and a
necklace the earrings are actually
really weird I don't I don't even know
why I bought these I just thought they
were cool-looking they basically just
look like safety pins and it's really
all there is to them then lastly I got
this gold chain necklace with a black
sideways cross on it and I think it's
very very pretty I've worn it a lot and
I've gotten a lot of compliments on it
as well now let's get on with what I
bought in New York and we were super
super busy that weekend so I really only
got to buy things from one store which
of course was brandy melville typical
beauty guru but yeah I got a lot of
things and I'm really really obsessed
with them so first off I got two
headbands they're both the same just in
different colors gray and black and I
really like wearing these around my
bonds or like twisting them into my buns
I don't know how to explain it but yeah
I really like these and that I also got
two skirts the first one looks like this
I actually wore it to IMATS it's
high-waisted and it's grey and it's
little but cute then I also got this
floral skirt and it's just navy blue
with white flowers and you guys have
seen this in my last video next up I got
a pair of high-waisted shorts and they
look like this this sizing is very weird
and I know that a lot of you guys were
asking me what size I am in these so I
got them in a size of 38 if that helps
I'm normally like a 24 25 and like
normal sizing yeah they look like this I
really like how they look with tights
and I just very excited to wear these I
also got a jean jacket which I ended up
wearing to the meetup on Sunday
it's got rose gold detailing and it's
just your basic jean jacket and I didn't
have one so that's why I got it next up
I got a dress which I also wore on the
Meetup it's short sleeved and it's black
and I really like it because the back is
so pretty it has like a little cross
kind of thing going on and it's got a
little cutout right here I don't know if
you guys can see that but it's super
flattering it looks really nice and it
kind of goes out on the bottom lastly I
got two cardigans and I think they're
called the Carolina cardigans I'm not
really sure but I got one in darker gray
as well as this oatmeal brown color they
just look like this they're very simple
but they go with many many things so
that's why I decided to buy them in two
different colors so that is everything
that I got from New York as you can tell
I didn't really buy much but yesterday I
went to an urban outfitters outlet and
everything was already discounted by a
lot and they're also having like 30% off
the whole store or something like that
so I did get a bunch of things the first
item I purchased was this tank right
here it's like a grayish army green
color and I thought it would be a nice
staple piece for the summer then I also
got this black like graphic t-shirt it
looks like that
next up I got this black flowy tank and
I thought it was very fancy and classic
looking so I think this will go with
many you know like skirts and fancier
pants and stuff for the springtime
next up I got a dress which I'm so
excited to wear I have no idea what I'm
gonna wear it to but I'm sure I will
find something so this is what the top
looks like it's I don't know how to
describe the pattern but it looks like
this then going down the dress it
actually cuts off diagonally so it's
super short on one side and then it goes
really long on the other so it looks so
so cool on and I am in love with it it
is beautiful next up I got these stripes
jeans which my friends were totally
judging me when I first picked them up
but I promise you they look super cool
when you actually wear them so they're
white and then they have dark grey
stripes and then on the insides
they have like black stripes going down
so don't really know what I'm gonna wear
these with but they look really really
cool on and they also make your legs
look longer and skinnier because of the
stride
lastly I got tuna tees and they are
actually the same exact style except
they are different colors and have
different designs on the front so the
first one looks like this it's light
gray and it says the Rolling Stones with
the lips and the tongue and what drew me
into these Nidhi's were the ripped like
sleeves and neck line so you can see
that right there over here as well as
the bottom so I don't know I just
thought it looked really cool I'm also
really weird about sizing because I
bought this in a size large because I
know I'll be wearing it with black
leggings so I wanted something that
would kind of you know cover up my butt
and I don't know I just thought it'd
look really cute oversized and then the
second one I got I got in a size small
because I know I won't be wearing these
with black leggings because it's black
so this one says Guns and Roses and it
looks like that it also has the ripping
on the neckline and on the bottom and
stuff so that is actually everything
that I bought I hope you guys enjoyed
today's haul video let me know if the
audio sounds any different because I'm
actually using a shotgun mic right now
and this is my first time trying it out
so hopefully it hopefully it worked
crossing my fingers so I will see you
guys in a new video very soon and head
is it bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
