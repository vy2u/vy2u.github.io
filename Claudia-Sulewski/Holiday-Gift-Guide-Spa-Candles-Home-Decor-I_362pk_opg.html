sound a little sick it's because I am
the holiday season isn't perfect here
today I'm gonna be giving you guys a
holiday gift guide on different ideas
and products that you can gift to your
friends and family
most of these are more catered towards
women like your mom's sister best
girlfriends but some of these are also
co-ed I love creating like a basket of
goodies with different stuff in it
because I think it makes like the
opening process more fun and so I just
wanted to bring that up and I kind of
use this as inspiration for this video
so just getting any sort of like wicker
baskets you could do a cute like tote or
stocking and just having like three or
four things in there for them to pull
out I think makes it really cute and you
can make them themed um speaking of
themes when shopping for gifts the two
categories that I tend to usually go for
are either like spa Beauty health kind
of relaxation stuff or stuff for your
home like home decor and different
little fun pieces and so those are kind
of the two categories that we're gonna
be talking about let's get into it I was
really proud of this idea because I
think it's so cute and I've never seen
anyone do this before but basically I
made a little book of masks I feel like
everyone enjoys a good face mask it's
not always the thing that everyone likes
to buy for themselves because it's
definitely not something that you like
need in your life at this point masking
is like a recreational hobby so
basically all I did was get this little
binder from Target and I found these
cute little plastic slips and yeah I
basically just have a bunch of masks
from different stores a lot of these are
from online you can honestly get them
anywhere and so I just slipped a mask
into every single little divider whoever
you give this to can just go through the
little book and pick one out I also made
it cute on the front by adding like a
little North Pole nametag thing and a
bow and stuff and so this is the first
thing that I want to show you guys
carrying into the same theme the next
thing that I
was this is the Braun epple 9 skin spa
epilator you guys know that I've been
working closely with Braun to try out
their different products and epilating
has become such a guilty pleasure of
mine that I love freakin doing and also
it's just like I never have to worry
about razor cuts anymore I also don't
have to stress about having prickly legs
like two days later it really changes
the game this is the second edition of
my four-part video series with them the
first one being my self tanner teen
which I still get so many questions on
I'll have that link down below if you
want to check it out I wanted to bring
this one up because I feel like this is
totally the type of thing that like not
everyone always wants like splurge on
something that's really really nice so I
think this would be a very thoughtful
gift for anyone close in your life I
wanted to include this specific version
because this one is kind of like the bad
boy it does everything and more so
obviously you have the Appalachian
feature which is basically pulling at
your hairs from the root way better than
waxing because it can pull hairs that
are three times shorter than wax can
you're left with smooth skin for up to
like four weeks with this I love
personally using this all over my legs
this model is the fastest it's the most
precise epilator you can detach the head
and you've got other things as well
let's talk about those things it comes
with two different exfoliating brush
heads and so you can put these on
basically they help to take off the dead
skin cells
it's scrubbing your skin clean by
exfoliating and also it's reducing
ingrown hair which is not a fun thing no
no you also have the deep massage pad
which you can use weekly once a week
whenever which basically helps to
stimulate blood circulation and it
leaves your skin feeling softer and
smoother it's also waterproof so you can
totally use this in the shower or in the
bath and then lastly you also get a
little shaver trimmer head you guys can
get this on Amazon of course I'll have
it linked down below you guys can check
it all out info down there I genuinely
think this is a very thoughtful gift to
give because it's very useful and I feel
like not everyone wants to splurge on
products for themselves and so this one
definitely goes unnoticed to wrap up
this category I was thinking of
different things like bath bombs and low
and perfumes and stuff like that but I
feel like those are pretty basic
standard ideas so I actually thought of
another one that goes with this and I'm
obsessed with these talk about them all
the time but I love oil diffusers these
are sold everywhere different sizes
different colors different shapes I
think these are one of the most relaxing
things ever you basically just put in
water and you drop in any essential oil
and just let it fill up your room and I
also think that this is something that
no one would really think to buy for
themselves just to give you guys some
ideas lavender is a great oil that I
feel like everyone likes and it's very
calming and then peppermint it's a very
cooling one I feel like that one goes in
the theme with the holiday season next
up we've got some homie things home
decor kind of stuff like that the first
one is such an obvious one but it is
such a people pleaser any sort of
candles I'm obsessed with Anthropologie
candles I think they just look beautiful
they have a great like high-quality
elegance to them and they always smell
so good too so just even throwing a bow
on top and then putting it into a basket
or bag this one is spiced cider is
actually a personal candle because I'm
obsessed with this smell but I just
think it's so pretty no one can have too
many candles my next gift idea is a
little Christmas treat jar this one I
had a lot of fun with I just added a
bunch of little fun treats I got this
giant glass jar and I filled up the
bottom with is it white like Garland is
that what it's called just like to fill
it up and make it look cute I just
bought different types of cookies of
course you can make homemade cookies
which i think is even cuter and then I
also threw in some large and mini candy
canes some little like marshmallow
treats for hot cocoa I added a bow on
top and a little name tag I think this
is so pretty because the jar can
obviously be used for so many things
after everything's been eaten but also
it's just such a pretty little display
that anyone can have like sitting on
their kitchen counter the last and final
idea that I have was making like a
little coffee table kids these days with
Instagram and everyone wanting
everything aesthetically pleasing you
can never go wrong with cute coffee
table stuff so I think coffee table
books are always a great gift
once again it's
just something that not a lot of people
find for themselves I really really like
this one it is in company of women the
book is just so pretty and it's female
empowering and so having a book like
that and then also I've got this little
fresh life spray that smells so good
when you spray it like on your couch and
in the air and then also a little
coasters too
I've got these little mismatched stone
colored posters I'll link them down
below but they have gold lining and I
think there's so pretty so those are a
few other things that I like to look for
when I am a holiday shopping for my
friends and family I hope this video
inspired some of you guys for your
Christmas shopping and be sure to leave
a comment down below letting me know
what you like to give people because I
love giving gifts and I love hearing
