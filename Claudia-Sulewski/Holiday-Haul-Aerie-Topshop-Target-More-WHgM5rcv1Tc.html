holiday-themed tall these are just a
couple things that i've recently gotten
to kind of help put me in the spirit and
when i think of the holiday season and
just christmas in general the colors
that pop in my mind are white grey
silver and anything that sparkly or
shimmery like green and red don't really
remind me of Christmas it's more just
like the gray and silver colors so let's
just get started um the first things
that I want to show you are my new
pillows and some of you actually saw
them in one of my most recent videos and
caught on to it but yeah I got new
pillows and they look like these I
recently decided that I kind of want to
change up my room a little bit i want to
take out the damask theme and just kind
of make my room more like chic and
simple looking so i got these three
pillows right here and they are all from
Target so first off I have this white
one which is all sparkly looking because
of the beads and I think it's so pretty
oh my gosh I love target pillows next up
I have this one and this is actually
from their holiday collection so you can
still probably purchase it right now but
it just has such pretty detailing on it
and the last pillow is just this gray
furry fuzzy pillow since the pillows are
all very unique and different I feel
like they kind of complement each other
because of liked the different textures
and stuff so next up I want to show you
guys some stuff that I got from aerie
and also I have some stuff that I bought
for my friends but I want to show you
guys so a couple weeks ago ere he
actually reached out to me and they
wanted to introduce me to their new
holiday collection line and their
holiday collection is all about sparkles
and shimmer and shiny things which was
perfect because that is exactly what
reminds me of the holiday season so they
ended up sending me to gift cards want
to spend for myself and the other for my
friends so I decided to take three of my
girlfriend's to go shopping and we just
we bought some stuff so first I'm just
going to start off with what I bought
for myself so I got these yoga
leggings right here and I think these
are so cute because they have a sparkly
greyish silver band yeah I've actually
already worn these a couple times and
they are very very comfortable next up I
got this little ball of hair ties and
there's silver and sparkly and they're
super cute and this was on sale for six
dollars so i just i had to buy it and
plus i literally lose all my hair ties
so i was very happy to get that so next
up i got a couple of twisty ties from
area i was so excited to see that they
sell these because all the twisty ties
that I own are officially lost I can't
find any of them or except for like one
of them so i was very happy to buy these
and there's great ones and silver and
blue ones so i thought these were very
very cute and yeah I got that next up I
got for bras I'm the first one I'm
actually wearing right now but it's just
a regular um like skin color bra and
it's very comfortable i literally wear
like every single day no that's why but
I wear it all the time and then i also
got three of their sports bras please
don't really have anything to do with
the holiday collection but i love their
sports bras they are so comfortable i
got this one right here oh and by the
way they were having like a buy one bra
get the other one for ten dollars i'm
pretty sure it's still going on right
now so that's why i bought four but yeah
this is the first one it's hot hot pink
it has a really pretty lace detail on
the front and the back and they also
have little pockets inside right here so
you can store like your key or I mean I
don't know what else you could put in
there like your gym membership card or
something I don't know so yeah I got
that one and then I also just got to
simpler ones I got a white one and a
black one because I freaking love these
so then I got three pairs of underwear
from their holiday collection the first
one looks like this it's just great and
it like scratches up on the butt which I
heard makes your butt look nice so you
know so it's good and I love the lace on
the edges right here and the little
sparkles and I just I think it's very
cute and then I also got to thongs
because
I'm a thong person they don't give you
the underwear line when you're wearing
like leggings or yoga pants or anything
like that so the first one it looks like
this it's gray and it has little sequins
on it a little bow on the back and then
I just got the same exact one except in
skin colored so looks like that and then
the last thing that I bought for myself
a dairy we're just black yoga pants and
they had a black band and I've been
wanting just regular old black band yoga
pants for the longest time because all I
own are those crazy bright colored like
pink ones so i was very happy to see
that they just had very simple black
ones because you know if the band is
showing and you're wearing something and
if you want it's like matching stuff
then it matches to everything I'm so now
I'm going to show you some of the stuff
that I bought my friends and I just let
three of my friends but their gift card
however they wanted to so I don't know
what what is for who or anything I just
let him choose whatever they wanted to
and they were really really excited so
I've got three bras right here this is
it very excited but the first one is
actually very cute it's black and it has
a really pretty like cheetah print
design on it and then it has lace on the
sides are no mush I'm sorry and then
these are the same bra except in
different colors oh this is the one that
I have perfect snow on their way right
now and it has a little cross in the
middle and it's just skin colored and
then the last one is just black and it
has the same thing middle and then also
I don't know about this but um so I got
the airy shimmer perfume I think this is
from the holiday line right shimmer I'm
guessing um but I wish I could open it
up and show you guys not show you but
tell you guys how it smells but um I
mean if they chose it then I'm sure it
smells nice and then lastly there are
two head hands and these are so cute I
actually wish I got some for myself now
that I look at them but they look like
this the first one is so cute dang it i
wish i bought this one
it has looking really pretty twisted
kind of wrap around look and it has
little diamonds on it and it's like a
tan color and then the other one is this
purple or navy blue I don't know my
lighting is weird are now so I can't
really tell but it looks like that and
then I don't know if you guys can pick
that up but it has like a sparkly
crochet to it so this is very pretty and
that is everything that I got from aerie
for myself and my friends so next up I
want to show you guys a top that i got
from Topshop and it looks like this it
has no sleeves and it has like this
little seam right here it looks very
cute and it's a little peplum top I
think it's so cute it'll go with so much
can you see it there you go it's very
simple but girly and cute and this is
the first peplum top that I ever owned
and it's grey so it totally reminds me
of the holiday time the next thing that
I want to show you guys was this candle
right here from Bath and Body Works and
I actually got this a while ago except
I've been waiting to let it I lit it
once but I want to burn like all my fall
scented candles first and then go
through this so this one oh I just like
smelled it it smells so good literally
smells like someone's baking cookies and
I am getting so yeah this is in the
scent Mary cookie and it is by far my
most favorite Christmas scented candle
um the next thing that I wanted to show
you guys is this OPI nail polish that
I'm actually wearing on my nails right
now and it is in the shade your royal
shyness and it's just a silver nail
polish with a bunch of little shimmers
and sparkles in it and I like this nail
polish because it's very opaque you can
just put on two top coats and you're
good to go so that's really nice last
item that I want to show you guys was
something that my mom recently got me
and I was so surprised and I'm just I'm
very very happy about them so they are
Juicy Couture gloves and I don't own
like any gloves except for these target
ones that are like striped and black but
these are
the nicest like prettiest gloves I've
ever seen they're like a dark charcoal
color and the actual glove part is this
really really nice soft leather I don't
know if it's real or not but looks like
that and the thumb and the index finger
are cut off so that you can you know
text and play on your iPhone's and stuff
in your touchscreen phones and then at
the top it has kind of like a sweater
knit material and it's so nice because
you can like scrunch it and make it a
look all cute and it's also very warm so
yeah I was very very thankful for these
and I'm so excited to style them for the
winter time when I'm you know going
downtown to shop or whatnot so I was
really happy about those and there's
everything from my hall definitely
brought me into the holiday spirit you
can just recording this video so comment
below if like silver and sparkly things

time I don't know why I don't know where
