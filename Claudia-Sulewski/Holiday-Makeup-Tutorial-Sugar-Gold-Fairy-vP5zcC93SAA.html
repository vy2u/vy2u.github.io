using it the masterpiece seven layers
all-in-one makeup set and this is from
Shanee cosmetics this set has a magnetic
closure and it has four eyeshadow
palettes it also has a lip palate
concealer palette and face palette so
now grabbing the concealer palette and
choosing the green corrector I'm just
going to apply that to any red patches
on my face to cancel it out
using a concealer that matches my skin
tone I'm just covering up any
imperfections then I'm grabbing my Mac
mineralize skinfinish natural and
applying this all over my face to set in
the concealer and add in a little bit
more coverage
after that I'm grabbing my favorite
bronzer from toothpaste and contouring
my face to slim it and add in a little
bit of color
now it's time to prime your eyes I'm
just using Urban Decay's primer potion
and blending that in pulling out the
fourth eyeshadow palette I'm choosing
this shimmery white grey eyeshadow and
applying this into the inner half of my
eyes from the same palette I'm choosing
this yellowish gold color and petting
this on the outer half of my eyelids I'm
also blending this up and over my crease
next I'm grabbing a darker gold
eyeshadow and applying this into my
crease this eyeshadow will be a great
transition to the next one we're going
to be using
after that you want to grab a goldish
bronze eyeshadow and apply this into the
crease to deepen up the look
I'm also priming my lower lashline and
applying the same eyeshadow that I used
before make sure to blend everything out
to keep it look soft I decided to take
the eyeshadow and place more into my
crease to make the look more dramatic
then going back to that first eyeshadow
we're just applying it to the inner
corners and bringing it into the inner
tear-duct
this will help to open up and brighten
your eyes if you want to use black
eyeshadow for your eyeliner all you have
to do is grab some sort of setting spray
and just spray it into the cap now
taking your eyeliner brush just dip it
in there and dip it into your eye shadow
so now your eye shadow is going to be
more like liquid eyeliner and you can
apply it to your upper lash line I'm
also bringing this eye shadow down to my
waterline
after that I'm using my favorite mascara
from benefits and applying this to my
lower and upper lashes
next I'm pulling out the first eyeshadow
palette and choosing this white matte
eyeshadow to highlight my upper brow
bone and I'm also going to drag it down
to my inner corners
for blush I'm using Mac's prism and it's
very subtle in lights which is what I
like I'm just applying that to my
cheekbones using a bright lip liner I
just line my lips and fill them in
then using Revlon's color bursts
lipgloss and cheers I just spy that
right over the lipliner I love this lip
gloss because it's bright red but it has
a little bit of pink in it and it's
super moisturizing and shiny
