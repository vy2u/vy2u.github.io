you can see we're not in my room today
we're actually in my living room I
started decorating the Christmas tree
today so it's super jolly and festive in
here
but in today's video I'm gonna be
showing you guys how to recreate the
look that I have on my face right now so
the face makeup is just really kind of
fresh and dewy looking the eye makeup is
super shimmery it's kind of like a
subtle smokey eye that's perfect for any
Paulo day party and of course I finished
off the look with a bright red lip so if
you guys want to find out how to create
this makeup look then keep on watching
let's get this tutorial started so I'm
starting off by using at my favorite
foundation from Make Up For Ever it's
the HD foundation and I am just dotting
it around my face and blending it out
with my Beauty Blender
this foundation captures really well on
video and photos so it's the perfect
makeup to wear to any holiday parties or
anywhere that you know you'll be getting
photographed so next up I'm using my
Maybelline instant age rewind eraser in
the shade brightener this is literally
like maybe the fifth bottle but I
purchased because I am so obsessed with
this stuff basically I just apply it to
any highlight points on my face and I
definitely go a little overboard but
that's alright and then I blend
everything out and it just brightens my
entire face then to set all of that I'm
using my Mac mineralize skinfinish
natural and medium plus and dabbing that
on my face then of course just contour
your face with any bronzer that you have
on hand
to start off the eyeshadow I'm using my
Maybelline Color tattoo 24-hour
eyeshadow in the shade at Sun washed sky
which is like a really pretty light blue
shimmery color and I'm just using my
concealer brush to apply it and blend up
with my fingers this cream eyeshadow
gives a really pretty like cool tinted
undertone to the rest of your eyes so
I'm also applying that on to my lower
lash line for the eyeshadow I'll be
using my nudes palette from Maybelline
so I am first dipping my brush into the
first color which is kind of like a
light nude eyeshadow and it looks really
pretty over the blue because it kind of
warms up the look but you can still see
the blue underneath
after that I'm dipping my flat shader
brush into the color right next to it
which is kind of like a muted taupey
color and I'm applying this right into
the crease and dragging it down into my
outer V so this is gonna kind of darken
up the look and add a little bit of
depth to it
the last color that I'll be using is the
one all the way to the right and it's
like a chocolatey dark brown color and
I'm just applying that in the outer V of
my eye and blending it out with a big
fluffy brush now of course you got to
throw on some liquid eyeliner so I am
using my Kat Von D ink liner in the
shade trooper and I'm just creating a
very thin line on my upper lash line to
kind of clean up the look and then I'm
applying on some mascara to my bottom
and top lashes throw on some subtle
neutral blush and we are almost done
with our holiday tutorial the last thing
we need is obviously some red lipstick
today I'm using my color sensational
lipstick in the shade and Scarlett I
totally talked about this in my holiday
in winter must-haves video because I
have just been absolutely obsessed with
this color I think it is so perfect for
the holiday time so I couldn't help but
use it again in another video
but I'm just applying it to both of my
lips obviously because putting it on one
would be kind of weird also Maybelline's
trend for the month is rebel Reds
so that is it for today's holiday makeup
