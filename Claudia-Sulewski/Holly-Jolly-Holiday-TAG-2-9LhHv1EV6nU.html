those of you who celebrate Christmas and
today I'm going to be doing the holly
jolly holiday tag to this tag was
created by strawberryelectric 48 and
beauty baby 44 and they take me to do it
so I really want to do it um and I'm
just a little bit late on this I'm
pretty sure today's like the last
acceptable day to upload this tag
figuring that it's Christmas Eve I
really want to do it so I just I'm doing
it um there are 15 questions and I'm
just going to give her it into it so the
first one is do you start your christmas
shopping are like friday or do you wait
until the last minute neither because
this year i mean i never liked used to
shop on black friday i mean this year i
did but i didn't really buy any
christmas gifts i mainly just bought
stuff for myself um but i also don't
wait till the last minute i'm like in
between number two asks if you could be
in any christmas movie what would it be
i would definitely want to live in
Whoville from how the grinch stole
christmas not the character like the
cartoon version but the real people
version of Jim Carrey I think the town
is so cute and colorful and everyone's
so happy and I think it would just be
really fun to like be a who and like
live in Whoville um number three is
which do you like better Christmas Eve
or Christmas Day definitely Christmas
Eve because we do more like festive
things like we have dinner with our
cousins and family members and the food
is always amazing my mom cooks like a
huge honey ham every year and it's so
good the christmas day like we open our
presents but we pretty much don't do
anything else christmas day so
definitely christmas eve number four is
when does your family put up your
christmas tree and who decorates it this
always varies sometimes we put it up
really early and there are times like
this year when we put it up literally
like three days ago I don't even know we
are really late this year but um yeah so
that was kind of sad and Starling my mom
decorates it sometimes I help but this
year I didn't really help I put up like
one ornament so you know that's how much
I contributed to that number five is
white lights or colored lights um
definitely white lights I feel like
they're more just classic
can simple we have white lights on her
house on our trees everything I just the
colored lights hmm I don't know number
six asks are you guilty of picking at
your presence or do you like the
surprise I definitely like the surprise
I don't I don't know why someone would
want to peek at their gifts because then
they have to fake like a surprised face
when they open it and if I did that that
would be so obvious I'd like open
something that I already know I got I'd
be like oh thanks like I knew you're
getting you that so no I like this
surprise a lot better number seven would
you rather live in a gingerbread house
or in Santa's workshop Santa's workshop
definitely um I think it'd be really fun
I I from all the movies I've seen it
looks like a cute and happy place tell
us your Christmas Eve traditions we
don't have any traditions my family so
lame um sometimes for the most part we
have all of our cousins come to my house
we just eat all the kids go upstairs and
play and stuff and there's there's
really no tradition at all is the just
that's it I don't know I mean we have a
fun time number nine asks if you could
be under the mistletoe with anyone who
would it be not Justin Bieber no oh no
number 10 what tops your tree um this
changes up I feel like we had a star one
year maybe not we normally either have
an angel or we have this weird like
fairy thing I mean it's cool I'm like we
have it on our tree this year but it's
like it's like a fairy thing and I don't
know why that would be on the top of our
tree but I mean I don't know my mom just
puts it up there I mean it looks good
but I just I don't know number 11 can
you name the 12 days of Christmas oh
gosh ok so there's five golden rings
something with a pear tree partridge in
a pear tree that's what it is um dunno I
feel like there's the word leaping
somewhere in there
clearly I can't so I'm just going to go
on to the next question I'm number 12 is
have you ever gone Christmas caroling no
I haven't is it fun have any of you guys
done it comment down below um number 3
and do you count down to christmas if so
how many days are left well um I
somewhat count for Christmas I don't
have like a nap or anything but um
there's one day left one night so ya
doing this on Christmas Eve II although
what are some foods and treats you can
count on having every holiday season um
there's the honey ham that we always eat
and just like any polish desserts or
like sweets cuz you know like my whole
family is a hundred percent polish so we
like have that then we have all that
gross polish food that I don't eat so I
like really just eat like a bunch of ham
um what else I mean gingerbread men
sometimes hot cocoa I don't know we
really just don't have like any
traditions at all it's it's kind of sad
polish food that's my answer the last
question is how has Christmas kept its
magic for you as you've grown older I
think that is such a cute question um I
think just all the activities that you
know you do for the holiday season like
ice skating um you know going into the
city if you live near a city and
shopping or my friends and I like to
look at like the zoo lights at the zoo
and just drinking hot cocoa and tea by
the fireplace lighting candles every
night I'm just like all those little
things kind of help put me in the mood
and have the magic in the air so that's
it for today's tag I hope you guys
enjoyed it once again Merry Christmas
for those of you who celebrate it and
stay tuned for a Christmas haul tomorrow
because I'm pretty sure I'm going to be
filming one so i'll talk to you guys
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
