the holly jolly holiday tag and I was
tagged by sweet Beauty ex to do it so
thanks girl for tagging me and also you
guys might notice that I put my
Christmas tree up last night and I know
it looks super weird it looks like
something from Whoville or like it came
out of like a dr. Seuss book or
something cuz it's like really tall and
it's not the top but you know what I
like it so yeah I decided to kind of
kick off my holiday videos with this tag
because I thought it was really cute and
fun so I just decided to start out with
this one so the first one is what's your
favorite Christmas movie oh my gosh I
have so many of them how this How the
Grinch Stole Christmas but the people
version that people version is really
good with like Jim Carrey also the
holiday Love Actually a Christmas story
all the home alone movies those are
super funny I don't know I can't really
think of all them but I love Christmas
movies they're super fun so the next one
is are you on the naughty list or the
nice list
I'm on the naughty list show us an
embarrassing Christmas card photo we
know you have one okay I actually don't
have one because my family does not take
Christmas card photos but I definitely
will insert some photos of maybe me
during the Christmas time if I do find
any if I don't sorry but yeah we don't
really take Christmas card photos so the
next question is have you ever had a
white Christmas yes I have one basically
every year it smells a lot where I live
and I love snow so I'm not really
complaining where do I spend my holidays
and I never ever go on vacation during
the holidays we're either at cousin's
house or like a relative's house or
family friend's house or our house so it
kind of like switches around B usually
on Christmas Eve we're like at my house
but then we always go to like Christmas
parties that like family friends houses
and stuff so yeah we usually stay home
for the holidays play or sang at your
favorite Christmas song
yeah that's definitely my favorite
Christmas song the next question is do
you open any presents on Christmas Eve
no maybe occasionally once in a blue
moon I'll like open one but we usually
stick to opening only presents on
Christmas morning can you name all
Santa's reindeer um no but I will try um
comment Blitzen
Rudolph Cupid blip there's like Blitzen
and glitzen I don't know Comet
yeah that's all about I know I'm not too
good with that stuff what holiday
tradition are you looking forward to
most this year probably putting up my
tree and stuff like that I guess I don't
really know we haven't put up our tree
yet and I love like helping my mom with
all the ornaments and stuff because as
you guys have seen last year our
Christmas trees get pretty crazy we are
like huge huge ornament collectors like
yeah I will leave the video of my
Christmas tree tour in the downbar and
you guys can see how crazy our ornaments
get so love doing that for sure
is there a Christmas tree real or fake
it's always real every single day every
single day
every year it's just been a tradition
like that we've never owned a fake one
so we just stick to the real ones
hands-down what is your all-time
favorite holiday food and holiday sweets
tree first sure my favorite holiday food
is my mom's honey ham she bakes this
like huge honey ham and you just like
cut slices out of it and eat it and it's
so good oh my goodness and my favorite
hot a sweet treat I don't really
one I guess candy canes and hot
chocolate I'm a huge hot chocolate
person so that doesn't like how does a
sweet treat but kind of does in my world
I don't know be honest do you like
giving gifts or receiving gifts better
um definitely love receiving gifts I
mean come on who doesn't but I also
really love giving gifts to just because
number one I love kind of like shopping
for the person being like who I want to
throw like this but definitely like my
favorite part about giving gifts is
wrapping it because I don't know why I
love wrapping gifts like I love like
putting all the um I love like in boxes
and then putting like the paper what's
it called
wrapping paper putting the wrapper paper
wrapping paper on the box cuz I can't
lie I'm pretty good at that and then
like just like all bows and like tissue
paper I don't know I love I like
wrapping gifts so if that was one of the
options it would definitely be a
wrapping gifts that's what I like the
best
show us your tackiest Christmas attire
um I don't really have one I'm sorry I
tried to be Christmassy by wearing a red
shirt but that's the closest you're
gonna get with me wearing something
Christmas related what would be your
dream place to visit for the holiday
season um probably I feel like Colorado
would be really awesome because I love
like being in the snow on like skiing
like snowboarding and all that stuff so
that'd be fun because I always want to
go skiing in Colorado so I think that'd
be cool during the holidays otherwise I
was just wanna be home because I love
being home for the holidays does your
family have a special holiday recipe you
like to help make no I mean I always
help my mom out with dinner and stuff
like that like all like cut the
vegetables for her and stuff but we
don't really have like any family
recipes I guess I don't know are you a
pro present rapper or do you fail
miserably okay this is kind of like
going back to like the whole gift
question
I'm definitely a pro president rapper
I'm just I'm so good at it
not gonna lie most memorable holiday
moments definitely would have to be
Christmas morning of course every single
year I always remember just like waking
up really
and you know waking up all my brother is
like guys guys wake up and then you know
like wake up my parents but yeah I like
I love like waking up really early and
just like seeing all the friends there
what made you realize the truth about
Santa it would probably have to be when
one time my brother and I were just kind
of like I think someone told me and then
I was like hmm if that's really true
like I'm just going to find my presence
and I ended up finding like my Christmas
presents like a month before Christmas
like behind the couch or like behind my
mom's headboard like in her bed I don't
know I like found the presents like a
couple weeks earlier and I was just like
wow really mom like he couldn't hide it
anywhere like more secretive so that is
how I found out the truth about Santa it
was kind of sad like you know what
happens do you make new year's
resolutions do you stick to them yes I
do but I don't stick to them
like I always make new year's traditions
like only drink water eat really healthy
work out you know like this many times a
week like I I make a lot of new
resolutions and I don't stick to them
not good at all at that probably stick
to them for like two months tops and
then I like forget about it which is
kind of bad what makes the holidays
special for you it would definitely have
to be like just like being with your
friends and family and stuff I love it
you know just like going back to all
those traditions that you do over here
like we always go to our like family
friends house and I'm always excited for
that holiday party and I don't know I
just love it and everybody's just so
happy it's such a like happy time with
the year which is really cute and stuff
and you know of course like those like
little special things that kind of make
it even better just like the holiday
music and like hot cocoa and like you
know going out of the town like with my
bus runs you know doing different like
holiday related stuff is really fun for
me so I think that's what just kind of
makes it special you know like all those
like little things that just kind of
bring you into the spirit and like stuff
like that that's what kind of makes me
like really just like happy about
Christmas
so yeah that is it for the tag I wish I
was longer because that was really
 and I'll have the questions down
there and I'll have everything else down
there so just check it out and I hope
you guys enjoy this video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
