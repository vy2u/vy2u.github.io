sharing with you guys my favorite pasta
salad recipe and it is called the lemon
vinaigrette pasta salad for this recipe
you're going to need some spinach and
arugula also you're going to need spicy
brown mustard salt pepper and olive oil
I also love adding these baby Tomatoes
and of course a lemon you're also gonna
need some feta cheese I really like the
tomato and basil feta cheese from Athena
you will also be needing some chicken
and when my mom likes to do is she just
buys baked chicken and she peels off the
skin and just rips the pieces apart and
lastly you're going to need some sort of
pasta and we like to buy the bowtie
pasta because it's fun to eat and it
looks cute
start out by boiling a pot of water and
once it's ready to go you can just add
in your pasta so while that's cooking
you can start making your lemon
vinaigrette now to prepare this all you
need is some sort of cup or a little
bowl and a whisk to mix it so now what
we're doing is we're just grabbing the
lemon and putting in a little bit of
lemon zest then we're going to cut the
lemon in half and start to squeeze out
all the juice and told everyone thinks
that he's cool once you're finished with
that just pour that into the little bowl
or cup now you can add in your mustard
and the measurements don't have to be
exactly perfect or anything it's really
up to your liking but we put in about a
tablespoon or a tablespoon to have so
it's really just personal preference
then you want to add in your olive oil
and once again we don't really have any
exact measurements I guess we put in
around 1/4 of a cup in the mix I'm not
really sure but you just want to pour
that in and mix it then we are adding in
the pepper and salt
so how's the chicken all you want to do
is grab a couple of pieces and shove
them up once you've done that just place
your chicken into the bowl and we
probably put in about three cups of the
chicken I'm guessing but of course it is
up to you once you're done with that
just add in your little baby tomatoes or
grape tomatoes whatever they're called
and we're just tossing it in the bowl to
mix it up a little bit and then once
you're done with that you want to take
your spinach and arugula and just start
chopping that up into smaller pieces as
well and you just want to add that into
the bowl next up you want to grab your
feta cheese and just pour a little bit
in there or a lot of it and that's
pretty much it so hopefully by now your
pasta is ready and once it is you just
want to lightly drain it out and pour it
right into the bowl the hot pasta will
help to moist and soft in the green
leaves so make sure that you mix it up
well Mainstreet
I said myself beside upon that shallow
muddy Ridge
I asked him why he comes the last step
is to pour your lemon vinaigrette on to
your pasta salad and mix it up one last
time so this is all you have to do now
you are completely finished with the
recipe and this stuff is amazing I'm
telling you guys you can eat it when
it's warm or you can eat it when it's
cold which is what I like to do so you
can store this in the fridge for a
couple of days it will probably be gone
the next day because it's so good but
yeah it will probably last a couple of
days so I hope you guys enjoyed today's
video and I will talk to you guys later
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
