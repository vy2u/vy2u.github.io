bit shorter with my hair and I decided
that I was going to film it because
strangely I got it many many requests on
how I like to cut my hair so I decided
why not film it and I don't want you
guys to take this video very seriously
because literally when I cut my hair
like you guys will see I do it so
unprofessionally I just I literally just
like cut it so this video is gonna be
more about kind of how I do it how I
like to cut my hair um so it's not
really any serious tutorial or anything
so I apologize for the lighting because
it is crazy washing me out but before
you start cutting your hair you want to
prepare yourself physically I like to
wear a shirt that contrasts with my hair
color so what my hair is very light on
the bottoms so I like to wear just any
you know old black shirt but if you have
dark hair then I recommend wearing like
a white one wear shorts because when you
wear long pants your hair literally gets
all over them and it's just so annoying
so you might as well wear shorts I like
to use two different types of scissors
the first kind are just your regular you
know old cutting scissors these are from
the brand tweezerman I love them because
they're super sharp and they just they
get the job done so um I like to use
these when I like to cut you know big
lengths off of my hair but when I'm
trimming my hair I like to use thinning
scissors and last time I mentioned this
in one of my videos I got so much hate
because people are saying that you're
not supposed to trim with these that it
you know breaks your hair leave split
ends well I don't know I think these
work great for me because um when you
cut your hair with thinning scissors
they don't cut every single piece off it
just cuts off a little bit so I like to
kind of make a cut and then I just go
farther and farther down my hair and it
kind of makes more like gradual um you
know cut so it's not very clean and
distinct and all that stuff so I mean
that's what I use it for and when I cut
my hair and I look at my ends after
cutting them with the
I don't have any split ends it cuts my
hair fine so I love using these it makes
it impossible to mess up on your hair
with these so I mean they work for me
whatever also I do want to mention that
today I'm only trimming my hair because
I pretty much am happy with my length I
just want it a little bit shorter so I
will not be using these scissors because
I don't want to take off too much length
I'm just going to be using these um but
you know I figured I might as well film
this because this is such a requested
video before I start cutting my hair I
like to split it in a middle part
because that's normally how I wear my
hair especially when it's curly and I
also don't section off my hair like top
and bottom because my hair is so thin so
I don't really have to then I just like
to brush my hair because obviously you
don't want any nuts in your hair I do
not cut my hair in any like professional
way like I really don't know what I'm
doing I'm just kind of cutting it I'm
just being honest with you guys like I
just I just kind of go for it so I guess
the first thing that I do is I comb out
my hair and I look at the like line of
my hair at the bottom and I just kind of
go from there first
so what I do is literally just cut you
also want to ask yourself on what kind
of cut you want whether you want
straight across or V or you or something
I do a very very light V it's basically
like my hair is cut straight across but
not like perfectly straight so I like to
have it kind of like a u if you see
these awkward little pieces right here
that was from when I decided that I want
to cut myself bangs never again so I'm
just letting those grow out I normally
just kind of leave them alone and just
work with the hair on the bottom so
that's why these pieces are like
awkwardly short in the front I basically
just go from one side to the other and
just trim my hair it's really nothing
that crazy
so hopefully you can see the shape that
I like to go for it's just like a little
baby you so now this is the part where
I've just do whatever I want to do with
my hair and once I'm done kind of
getting that shape down um so I'm just
gonna start out by giving myself some
little baby layers so I just take piece
from the top and I literally just like
cut them like I there's no like specific
thing that I do I just I just Rim them
so that is all that I do when I cut my
hair I'm probably going to keep trimming
a little bit but I feel like this video
cannot get any more boring than it
already has so I'm going to stop
recording but that's all that I do I
really just cut my little shape at the
bottom and then I just take random
pieces and just kind of go with it and
cut it here is a closer look at my
little amateur layers um but this is how
my hair normally turns out so that is it
for today's video hopefully you guys
found it somewhat informative but that
is how I cut my hair nothing really
crazy so um yeah I will see you guys to
her new video very soon and that is it
bye Claudia what my leg I just cut my
hair like a five-year-old
that's so crazy for a while now everyone
brought your place okay I just dropped
something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
