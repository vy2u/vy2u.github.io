as previously mentioned in one of my
newer videos I'm going to be going it to
Florida from March 2nd to March 8th I'm
so freaking excited but I decided to
take this opportunity to create a mini
series for you guys so it's gonna be
called Spring Break with Claudia where
I'm just going to be creating videos for
you guys that are related to the beach
and vacation and all that stuff
and I thought this was the perfect
timing because I know that a lot of
people have spring break in the month of
March I'm pretty sure everyone does
right so I thought it was the perfect
timing since I am going on vacation a
little earlier than all of you so that
you guys can actually watch these videos
and kind of prepare yourself for Spring
Break so these videos will all be
available for you guys to watch before
you actually go to kick off this mini
series I decided that I want to film
eight how I pack my suitcase video so
I'm going to be showing you guys how I
like to pack for vacation as well as
what I'm packing for Florida this year
and that is all that I want to say in
today's intro let's get into it
the first thing that I like to do when I
pack a vacation is make my bed so I have
a nice clean and spacious area to lay
out all the things because I like to
kind of organize everything and see
everything in front of me before I
actually put it into my suitcase so what
I like to do is just make my bed so it's
all nice and pretty and stuff also it's
really great coming home to a really
clean and nice bed you just feel very
like happy and relaxed next up I just
start laying out different articles of
clothing on my bed and I like to keep
them in categories so I'll pile up all
my shorts in one spot my tank tops and
the other so I just like to keep things
in categories just so that everything is
organized I know exactly what I'm
bringing but once I have everything
piled up together then I just make sure
that I have everything that I need to
and I start putting it into the suitcase
so now let's
get into what I'm actually bringing to
Florida with me okay so I've pretty much
laid everything out am i bad that I'm
bringing to Florida with me as you can
see I pretty much have everything in
categories it kind of got a little
clustered as I went it was a little more
organized but I tried to fit everything
onto my bed so I am going to Florida for
seven days so that's why I'm breaking
kind of a lot of stuff but this really
isn't that much I don't know the only
thing that I'm missing from this pile
are my electronics and the things that
I'm going to be bringing on my carry-on
as well as my makeup and makeup brushes
so I guess I'm just going to start over
here I've got some like muscle t-shirts
and random shirts here I've got some
spaghetti straps shirts here as well as
some crop tops then going over here I've
got some simpler just t-shirts kind of
loose-fitting stuff here's like a
crochet top then over here so far I'm
just bringing one nutty and I'm also
bringing a flannel I'm not really sure
if I'm going to bring any more sweaters
I have to check what the weather is
going to be like but so far I've got
those two then this pile over here all
my shorts so I'm just bringing some
high-waisted shorts and some low-rise
shorts so not too many but just a few of
those then over here oh I need to get a
sports bra okay yeah I have like two
workouts shirts a pair of sweatpants and
then I need to pack a sports bra and
shorts and also I'm going to be wearing
like workout leggings on the plane so
I've got that stuff and for working out
I'm bringing these because my mom and I
are going to want to go on walks every
morning and stuff then over here I've
got um why did I close this when I knew
I was only gonna have one hand available
I don't know hold on hold on here's the
jewelry I'm bringing I'm not bringing a
lot because we're pretty much just gonna
be like chilling on the beach every
single day reading books and stuff we're
not going to be really going out
anywhere so I have a few like necklaces
in here and then I just have my rings so
I'm not really going too crazy with the
jewelry I am bringing
just bobby pins hair ties hair clips
stuff like that then going to this
little pink and orange polkadot case
it's a little dirty because I always use
this for my toiletries but I'm breaking
some dry shampoo with me a moisturizer
toothpaste white nail polish black nail
polish facial cleanser and then also
I've got my deodorant perfume some Crest
Whitestrips a brush toothbrush razor and
a spot treatment then over here in the
middle I've got some makeup wipes
because I tend to get very lazy on
vacation so I already know I'm going to
be needing like the whole pack of these
and these things I don't know if I'm
going to be packing them I think I might
be taking these with me in that moisture
yet this is just a case for all my
memory cards and stuff what's cool is it
like locks but then I'm also bringing my
Polaroid camera and I got like a 50 set
for taking pictures then coming over on
this side I'm just bringing two dresses
I don't I don't really know if I want to
bring any more I've just got two Sun
dresses to wear we're like a swimsuit
I'm bringing a lot of rappers because
rompers are definitely like one of my
favorite outfits to wear on vacation
just because it's so easy to just throw
on and you don't have to worry about the
top and bottom so I'm bringing this one
from Elle laughs it's like one of my
favorite rappers it's ombre and it's so
so pretty it looks really pretty the tan
I've got a similar one that's an all
white lacy looking black one a floral
one from Urban Outfitters and a baby
pink one up from brandy melville I've
also got some bras and underwear over
there then let's make our way over here
I'm bringing a lot of swimsuits with me
because I'm going to be doing a video
that has to do with swimsuits for this
series so I'm bringing a bunch of those
I decided I'm only going to bring two
smaller bags I will probably be carrying
a bigger one on the plane but I'm going
to be packing these two because they're
my most used purses so we've got this
black chained and quilted one from
forever 21 and this brown one is from
Marc by Marc Jacobs and that's
everything that I have right now so I'm
going to show you guys a clip of me
pecking all this and I'm also going to
show you guys when I'm bringing on the
plane with me
also I quickly wanted to show you guys
the suitcase that I'm going to be
bringing with me and this is the one
that I got for my birthday
it's from Swiss Army thank you to all of
you who comes it about that because I
was not sure before but it's just a
medium sized Rolly suitcase and
hopefully everything fits in here I
think it will though okay let's pack
this I was about to say the B word okay
bye
so update I've pretty much packed
everything into my bag I'm not going to
close it all the way though because I
still have to brush my teeth and stuff
since my toothbrush and toothpaste isn't
there but I want to show you guys what
I'm bringing on the plane with me so
this is going to be my carry-on bag it's
just a Lululemon yoga bag I use this all
the time because it's so great it has so
many pockets on the inside and outside
and it's the perfect size so in here I'm
going to try my best to fit this stuff
and my computer and computer chargers so
I'm going to put my laptop in here along
with my youtube planner and my everyday
lifestyle planner I'm also going to put
my hairbrush in one of these outside
pockets and the two bags then in this
little bag right here I've got two extra
lenses and a microphone and the memory
cards and then also I have two charters
for my blog camera and ruble so that's
the stuff that I'm going to be putting
in this duffle bag and then I'm also
going to be bringing this bag with me to
keep under the sea in front of me so in
here oh gosh this is probably not all
going to fit maybe I'll put this in here
but I've got this little pouch that has
like a few lip products mirror
headphones just stuff that I like to
bring on the airplane with me my
polaroid I also bought divergent a few
days ago I've never read this book
before so I'm going to try to read this
entire book throughout the week plus
we're not going to be doing it very many
exciting things I don't know what we're
going to doing but I thought a book
would be nice to bring with me I've also
got my wallet and then also I packed my
makeup I'm not really bringing a lot
it's pretty much all like 50% lip
products and then also my brushes so
that is probably everything that I'm
going to bring that is my entire packing
journey so once I pack this up I will be
done
so that is it for today's video I hope
you guys enjoyed it um and that is
everything that I'm packing for Florida
