collabs is a book featuring yours truly
oh yes Solinsky and a bunch of other
youtubers 24 other people from the
internet all who wrote true stories
about themselves about their lives so
the book comes out on April 25th and
we're doing something about honesty
today to kind of talk about it oh
there's going to be a lot of honesty in
today's video since we're having a
slumber party I thought why not go be
stereotypical row and have a pillow
fight the whole thing okay
hey does yes true did you have the they
do have the pillow fight so so another
we are going to be asking each other
very personal intrusive and basic
question and if we decide to not answer
that question
then I'll read it back to the face with
a pillow so I have a question I want to
ask could you name all of your roommates
in the order that you like them the most
to the least you're gonna have to hit me
I can't do that really rope uh-huh yes
no I'm not there's no way I'm doing that
he's moving a lamp out of the way right
now okay are you ready uh yeah okay a
couple years you have failed and worked
with a ton of youtubers who was the
hardest youtuber to work with okay total
pain in the butt hopefully total pain
but what do you mean because there been
every day been obtained
it could be like their team was really
hard to work with they were late or you
know it doesn't have to be like oh they
were necessarily the rudest person go
ahead answer that one no I'm not Mansell
I didn't know it was about ugly since
it's soft I'm gonna do it face oh good
that's great thank you why did I do that
okay Oh
full name one youtuber that people don't
know you either dated or hooked up with
I literally can't how many are you
thinking about right now how many are
there that Vieira doesn't know they
might eat it three three okay guys you
have to comment down below who you think
the three I got is so funny like I
didn't know am saying though is that any
one of them now thank you

your least favorite thing about me at
least everything about you just excuse
it like annoys you she always does that
no I will say that out of all of my
YouTube friends you are always like the
most gracious with your time you always
respond fast anybody else like your
fantastic like I'm not even like
secretly stinking I know I know you're
like searching for an answer but we need
an answer how do you I'm 21
that's probably it is like I would love
to like go on like double dates with you
and like I got your thing with like less
you more and everybody even though you
guys are mature is they have different
lifestyle so my idea of a date would be
like 6:00 p.m. you are probably follow
getting all ready for a date at that
point this is like vemos boring and has
stirred in the world like hey the reason
I don't like you is you're not orange
how much money did you make on your last
brandy oh it's kinda Galicia nuff yeah
who cares man I I got I got I got it the
last thing that I got paid for I'm not
going to say like how small or how big
it was like it could run under anything
well it doesn't matter like it whatever
it was
fat cake okay five thousand dollars for
something something we get overpaid for
everything but yeah like youtubers get
paid a lot of money which is why you see
them with like cars that they shouldn't
be driving when they're very a fifteen
and a half years old all right Papa
Molly I'm sweating I got it you
obviously know what everyone has written
in this book what's in here right your
publisher told you that you had to X out
someone story from this book can be mine
don't you shoot camper you're cooking
pasta for sure can be are you in about
the truth because I know it's citrus I
mean like the true answer that I know
you won't accept is one of my stories by
the own expense
how many you brace yourself listen I get
it I guess ah before you were 21 what
was the name on your fake ID flying
asleep once there is like do you have
one made because you had a fake ID to
get into concert obviously really hard

devastated okay you know me and my
brother who do you think it's better
looking to look at a picture of your
brother no you don't think you just
couldn't say him he's so good-looking

I've been wondering on the story here we
go I was going to rehearsal for a show
like last month Oh
after urinal and I was on my fall and I
was putting everything away I didn't
realize there was a little bit left and
I actually peed enough to the point
where like you could see a spot now I
have to go rehearse and when you're a
host it's not like you're rehearsing the
scene sitting down it's like you're
standing there and there's an audience I
was hosting like this it tells me a
little bit about what kind of where you
got started and what's going on
then also tell me he didn't tell me
about it don't literally within the past
like four weeks like five days ago yeah
