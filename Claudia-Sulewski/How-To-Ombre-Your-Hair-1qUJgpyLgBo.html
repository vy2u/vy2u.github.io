kissed every native I ladies basically
everyone so today I'm going to be
talking all about my hair color and how
you can achieve it at home because I get
questions asked about my hair color all
the time whether I do it at home or if I
get it done I do like to ombre my hair
at home and obviously right now it's not
like perfectly ombre because it has
faded since I last dyed it but I mean
you can see kind of the gist of it how
it's a darker up here and lighter down
here um today I'm actually going to be
showing you guys how I do my hair
because recently my cousin Daria asked
me if I could ombre her hair because her
hair was ombre but it faded a lot she
didn't really like it anymore um so she
asked me to do it for her and um I
thought that was the perfect chance to
film it for you guys and create this
kind of how-to video for you so I'm
going to be teaching you guys
step-by-step on how I dye my hair and
I'm also going to be showing you how to
do it on my cousin Dorian so the first
step is to buy your hair dye and I am
completely obsessed with the Revlon
frosting a little highlighting kit I've
been using it for over a year now from
the first time I went blonde to now I've
been using those highlighting kits and I
really like them because they have
bleach in them as well as like the
blonde color and there's also three
different shades so there's highlighting
kit for brunettes for darker blonds and
for lighter blondes so obviously when
the first time I put in highlights I
used the one for dark brown and now I
use the one for blondes so I think
that's great because then there's kind
of like a highlighting kit for every
hair color so I definitely recommend
getting that I think it's great for the
second step you want to brush out your
hair and make sure that there are
absolutely no knots and you also want to
prepare some foil strips because
obviously when you're doing highlights
you
to cover your highlights with foil um so
I like to pre like cut / rip foil strips
just so that I have an easy at hand and
I don't have to do it while I'm dyeing
the hair so then for the third step I
like to split the hair in half the
bottom and top so as you can see here I
just took half of the upper part of
Dora's hair and put it up and I'm just
going to be working with the bottom hair
first
so and I'm going to start dyeing and
what I like to do is basically make a
bunch of little highlights throughout
the hair there are many different
methods for ombre hair I mean you can
just take your entire hair and just
bleach it and then I don't know I don't
really like doing that though I like
taking individual little highlights and
um putting dye on each highlight but
making sure that you change up the
length of the highlights that technique
is going to help make your ombre hair
look more natural and kind of gradual
looking instead of just being a straight
line across your hair and what I like to
do is mainly focus on the bottom of the
highlights so I'll put the most product
there because obviously the bottom of
your hair is where you want it to be the
lightest and then as I'm working up the
highlight I like to kind of wisp the
little brush kind of lighter because
that will help to give like a more
gradual effect instead of just being
like a solid blond highlight that just
stops halfway down your hair I also
don't like to highlight every single
piece of hair I like to keep a couple on
the natural hair color because then it
just won't be too crazy blonde at the
bottom will be more kind of
natural-looking
so once you finish making all the
highlights on the bottom portion of your
hair you just want to split that in half
and throw it in front of your shoulders
so that now you can work with the other
hair so once I took the top section down
and what I like to do is split it into
three so you have the hair that's in the
back of the head and then also the hair
that's going to be on the front / side
of her face so I just took the front
hair put it in front of your shoulders
and kept the hair that's in the back
the head on her back so now you're just
going to be doing the same exact thing
that you just did just making a bunch of
little highlights everywhere making sure
that each highlight is a different
length so that there's variety and also
making sure to focus most of the hair
dye on the bottom and just kind of
lightly stroking it as you go up
old man blender took a walk downtown to
the edge of the Main Street bridge I
said myself beside him on that shallow
muddy rich I asked him why he comes and
goes and why he never stays he said son
I've always been here I have never gone
away I saw the black gold in the streets
and watched it all go bust I saw the
Great Depression so fortunes turned and
dust people deceive me when I make my
presence known but they only really
stay inside my
Oh
so once you finish highlighting your
entire head you want to make sure that
you let it set in obviously and this
part is always different for everyone
because it really just depends on how
fast your hair will lighten so for
example for me my hair takes a long long
time it takes up to like an hour
sometimes I'll have to let it sit in my
hair
darkness hair was actually pretty fast
I'd say it took about 30 to 40 minutes
or something around 30 also if you want
to speed up the process and what I like
to do is take a blow-dryer and
individually blow-dry every single
highlight this method will help to speed
up the process because when you're
applying heat to the hair dye then it's
going to process more quickly and bleach
your hair more quickly so we were in a
hurry because starting it to go to the
work so this was perfect because it
really helped to speed up the bleaching
process if you're not sure how long you
should keep the hair dye in then I
definitely recommend to check the
highlights every so often maybe every 20
minutes or 10 minutes
um and I recommend doing this obviously
because then you can see how light you
want your hair to get and then you can
stop when you think it's blond enough
and also keep in mind that when your
hair is wet it obviously looks darker
than when it's going to be dry like if
you're going for like bleached blonde
hair and it doesn't look like that keep
in mind that it will be a little bit
lighter when it your hair is actually
dry so once you've let the hair dye sit
in for as long as you want obviously the
process is pretty easy you just take out
all the foil and then I just like to use
the shampoo and conditioner that they
give you with the highlighting kit
because I personally really like it um
so in film this part because I didn't
really think it was necessary but we
just threw her hair into the shower and
she just washed her hair and stuff and
blow-dried it and that's really it it's
pretty simple it takes about an hour for
me to highlight someone's hair it's
obviously a little bit more difficult
for me to do it to myself because I need
to have like a mirror behind me and
stuff but overall it's a pretty fast
process and I definitely recommend doing
it if you guys want to try it out
because it saves you so much money and I
just I
how it turns out I think it turns out
great once you have blow-dried your hair
and stuff then this is how the result
will look like well at least this is how
it turned out for Daria why he comes and
goes why he never stays he said son
so I also recommend that you don't wash
your hair for at least 24 hours because
you know you did so much bleaching and
dyeing to your hair you want to kind of
give it a break let the natural oils you
know like go down to your hair and stuff
if your hair turns out brassy looking or
just kind of orangish looking or you
don't feel like it truly looks blond
then I definitely recommend getting
purple shampoo
I love the John Frieda purple shampoo
it's super cheap compared to like other
brands and stuff so I currently have it
sitting in my shower and every so often
I use it to kind of um you know bring
some life into my blonde hair make it
look more natural so I definitely
recommend um investing in a purple
shampoo and conditioner that's
everything for today's video guys
weren't too distracted by my cat isn't
she being so cute literally I turn on
the camera she like hopped behind me um
but I hope you guys enjoyed today's
video I've been lied to film this for
the longest time but I didn't want to
read I my hair and then my cousin asked
me I was like huh this is a sign um so I
hope you guys enjoyed today's video and
I will see you guys for anyone bye
seriously look at how cute she is
oh my god

instagramming okay trust a mother bitch
