show you guys how to take one of the
most popular trends that I saw on the
runway this season which was leather and
incorporate it into a day look and night
look so if you guys like to see me
transform a fairly simple and fancy
outfit from daytime to nighttime thank
you watching for today's look I'm going
to be using this leather top and these
textured trousers and I'm going to be
showing you guys how to transform this
basic look from daytime to nighttime so
let's start off with the date-time look
I'm keeping my eye makeup very fresh and
simple by just applying on my benefit
they're real mascara to my upper and
lower lashes since my eye makeup is so
simple I decided to go for a pop of
color on the lips by using my Maybelline
Baby Lips in the shade pink shock this
lip balm gives crazy color payoff and
keeps my lips very moisturized to create
my daytime look I'm pairing my outfit
with this black necklace from Topshop
these modern black leather ankle boots
from forever 21 and this black totes
from forever 21 as well
Oh
oh we're sorry
flight info
for my nighttime look I want to darken
up my eye makeup so I'm starting off by
wiping off my Baby Lips chapstick and
applying on a lighter lip color so I'm
using Mac's lipstick in the shade hue
for eye makeup I am grabbing my
Maybelline master smokey eye pencil in
the shade black smoke and I'm basically
just smudging it across my upper and
lower lashline to darken up my eye
makeup since this pencil has a sponge on
the other end it's perfect for on-the-go
smokey eyes to create within minutes for
my nighttime look I'm pairing my outfit
with a color-block jacket from Windsor
I'm also switching out my shoes for some
black heels from forever 21 and this
black and white clutch from forever 21
the truth may vary this ship will carry
our bodies safe to shore
before i end up with today's video i
like to thank Maybelline for partnering
with me to create this fashion week
inspired video and I will see you guys
for a new one very soon bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
