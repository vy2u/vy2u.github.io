today's video
things are gonna be a little more
low-key so I'm not really gonna have any
crazy editing or anything like that
as much as I love creating those videos
for you guys they do take a lot longer
and my schedule this week is just a
little bit crazy and to top it off my
19th birthday is also this Thursday as I
was planning out my week last night I
thought of a video concept where I kind
of talked to you guys about what I do to
make the most of my day hence have the
perfect day I am by no means a perfect
person who has all of her shoes together
but for the most part I feel like I am a
very self-disciplined and productive
person who gets things done if she wants
to and knows that she needs to and I
know that a lot of people struggle with
that because they don't really know
where to begin with things like that so
today I'm going to be talking about the
things that I do to help me stay
productive and pretty much just make the
most of every single day hopefully some
of you guys find this video somewhat
informative and without further ado
let's get started the first thing that
I'd like to do is plan and prepare the
night before so the first question you
want to ask yourself is what do you want
to achieve tomorrow what I like to do is
organize my thoughts and create a
schedule that is solely dedicated
towards tomorrow basically just a to-do
list of everything that I want to
accomplish in order for the next day so
whether you're the type of person to
write out a to-do list or type it up on
your phone some people use planners or
the calendars and their phones random
notebooks like this whatever works with
you figure that out and write down
exactly what you want to accomplish that
next day also my phone really works is
creating kind of time blocks for
everything that you want to start and
complete if I know that I'm gonna have a
really really busy day then I
do this and I will literally write out
the time for what I want to wake up eat
breakfast start working maybe work out
do whatever I need to do and depending
on what the you know like activities or
whatever I'll put in like an hour of
time or two hours of time over half hour
when you physically write something down
you are more likely to actually
accomplish it and want to you know check
out that little box or scratch it off
for any of you guys that create to-do
lists then you know exactly what I'm
talking about so that's what I like to
do to plan out my next day and now to
prepare for my next day I like to ask
myself what do I want to wake up to
whatever situation or mood I'm waking up
to in the morning highly affects how my
day will unfold I personally know that
waking up to a clean room always makes
me more motivated to get out of bed and
start my day so I always love to quickly
kind of clean up and put anything away
right before bed so that I know that
I'll be waking up to a clean room I also
get super thirsty in the morning so I
like to wake up to a jar of ice water
next to me on the nightstand usually the
ice is melted by now but the water is
still kind of cold but I always don't do
that because I always appreciate it the
next morning the base will all depends
on the person because obviously we're
all different but another example would
be writing a quote above your bed or on
your wall somewhere that you will see
right when you wake up reading one of
your favorite inspiring quotes every
single day when you wake up can highly
change your attitude and entire just
mantra for the day so we've got planning
and preparing checked off these two will
help you thank you start off your day
Annika folks as well as with a positive
attitude and now that you're ready to
begin your day obviously you have to
start following the schedule that you
made the night before so now I want to
talk to you guys about the things that
helped me make the most of my day
personally for starters that the first
thing that I like to do in the morning
is drink a large mason jar glass of iced
water
I love preaching about drinking water in
the morning because there are so many
benefits to doing it it's a great way to
kind of start your day and
wake up from your slumber next up we've
got morning workout and I know that not
everyone can do this because a lot of
you guys go to school and a lot of you
guys do not have access to a gym so that
is totally fine a warning workout can be
super short and simple but it still
helps because it will energize you it
will put you in a overall good mood and
help relieve stress throughout the day
also jumpstart your metabolism and in
general it just makes you feel better
about yourself because you feel like
you've already completed something
awesome so you start feeling all
productive and confident in yourself and
morning workouts are seriously just the
best thing ever so if you don't have
enough time to do that
or you don't have a gym to go to then
that is totally fine because you can
literally search up like morning
workouts on tumblr and you will find
pictures of just little short workouts
that you can complete within 20 minutes
and even just doing that will greatly
impact your day and change your entire
mood and attitude my next one is totally
a given but what you eat affects your
entire day obviously if you're gonna be
putting you know sweets and junk food
into your system you're not gonna be
fueling your body with the right
minerals and nutrients and vitamins that
it needs so you're gonna feel really
down on yourself and really sluggish and
not energized and all of those effects
will affect how you go about your day
you're not gonna want to go out and
exercise and work towards you know some
project that you've been meaning to
finish your started for that test that
you have in a few days eating healthy
makes you feel good about yourself you
feel confidence it also a general makes
me feel like I just have everything
together and I have my life in order so
eating your fruits and vegetables is
very very important guys stay away from
the processed food and eat nature's
delicious candy my next tip is to
surround yourself with the type of
people that you want to become so I
personally like
to surround myself with passionate
people driven people optimistic people
who always find the positives and things
and don't think about the negatives and
focus on those if you're eating out
someone that is constantly complaining
and you know talking bad about people
and things like that that's gonna run
both of you and that of course will
affect how you think about things and
obviously your thoughts become things so
those are pretty much the things that I
like to do and keep in mind when I want
to have a productive day and just make
the most out of it so to kind of wrap up
my thoughts and today's video I think
it's just really important to set goals
for yourself and believe in yourself I
know so many people that doubt
themselves and set limitations and they
just stay constant or go backwards they
never move forward and grow from it so
I'm just getting super cliche here but
having self-confidence and believing
that you can achieve what you want - is
such an important practice and I'm still
working on it there are so many times
where I don't think that I can do
something but my advice is just to go
out and do it because there's no point
in not trying something out if you are
scared that you know you're not gonna do
a great job where you're not gonna
finish in time that kind of wraps up my
entire video on how I like to make the
most of my days and kind of stay
productive bubbly I was able to help out
