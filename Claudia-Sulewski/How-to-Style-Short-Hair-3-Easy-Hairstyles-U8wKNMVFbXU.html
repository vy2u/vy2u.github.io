here we go hey guys so today's video was
a very very requested ever since I cut
my hair shorter you guys have been
asking me to do a video about what
hairstyles I like to wear and style with
my shorter hair and I know my hair is in
that short but for me this is short if
you guys would like to see my top 3
hairstyles that I like to do throughout
the week every day my life hmm then keep
on watching
for this look I like to use a
medium-sized curler and I'm going to
start off by splitting my hair into two
and dividing that into half when curling
my hair I make sure to alternate
directions and use different techniques
whether I'm wrapping the hair around the
barrel or using the clamp
Chico Cheech switching up your curling
method creates the illusion of messy and
natural waves
to lock in my curls I like to use my
healthy sexy hair hair spray and I just
spray that in and scrunch it as I go
after that I like to use these black
mini clips that I get from H&amp;amp;M to pull
back my front pieces taking small
sections from both sides of my hair I
then put them together twist them and
clip it in place I also like to pull out
a few of the front pieces and loosen
things up to keep it looking casual the
second look is one of my favorites
figuring I wear it every single day and
it is the 3-second bun it literally
takes three seconds guys
I know what you're thinking what about
we watch that again start out by
throwing all your hair together then
pulling the elastic halfway down the
ponytail twist your wrist backwards then
cut the bun with your hand then pull
over the elastic with your other hand to
secure the bun I love this hairstyle so
much because it works best with short
hair it takes no time no effort but it
still looks really cute
you
if I'm not wearing a bun I'm most likely
wearing look number three which is
straight and volumize so I'm starting
off by grabbing some Moroccan oil
rubbing it in between my fingers and
just moisturizing the ends of my hair I
then take my tangle teezer and brush out
any knots that I have in my hair
to add some volume into my roots I start
out by grabbing a smaller comb and back
combing different sections of my hair
I then use my volumizing dry shampoo
spray it throughout my roots and shake
it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
