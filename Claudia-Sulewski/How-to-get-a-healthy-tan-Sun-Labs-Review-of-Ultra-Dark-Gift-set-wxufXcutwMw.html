why this camera it's like really washing
me out I think it's cuz I was messing
with like the white balance thing or
whatever and about you know tanning
getting tanner you know stuff like that
because summer is on its way
it's practically spring if you ask me I
think it's like springtime and summer is
on its way and of course every girl's
well not every girl's but a lot of girls
dream is just to get super-dee-duper tan
for a summer so you look good in your
swimsuit so today I'm gonna talk about a
little bit about tanning and stuff like
that okay so before I say anything you
guys know that I went to Florida so
that's where I'm kind of like tan oh
there you go you can see my tan on my
legs but not on my face that makes so
much sense and I look like a ghost on my
face right now I don't know why so
basically tanning is really really bad
for your skin because you know you get
like age spots on your face and on your
skin you can get skin cancer from
tanning if you don't use you know like
enough SPF for example example a I don't
use like any SPF which is super bad so a
great way that I like to you know
Stacy's tan is to use a tanning lotion
and you guys knew because last summer I
made a whole video about tanning lotion
I was talking about how I really loved
the L'Oreal one and stuff like that
and so let me just say something the
L'Oreal one was like a white lotion and
I couldn't it was kind of hard to like
master it because when you would put on
your legs
you had no idea where you were putting
it because it was like transparent and
then the next morning you'll find like
you know spots all over your legs and
stuff so it's kind of hard to use that
stuff but recently I found a complete
new like you know company of tan
motion and stuff like that and it's been
working great for me I love it smells
amazing and honestly they're like no
floss about these products and today I
just want to talk about them and
basically the products that I'm talking
about today and I know people have made
videos on here before I see many gurus
make videos about these products but you
know it's kind of good to like hear
everybody's opinions you know if you're
deciding on whether you want to buy them
or not and today I'm going to be talking
about the Sun Laboratory
you know tangle ocean set so basically I
did get these products for free but you
guys know that I don't my I wouldn't lie
to you guys because I seriously am in
love with this stuff if I ever got a
product that I didn't like I wouldn't
make a video about it um but basically
I'm just gonna talk you through the
steps of these products I'm gonna show
you before and after and I'm also gonna
show you like how I use them and put
clips of that in there too as well so
first I want to tell you guys the set or
gift set that I got so I got the ultra
dark gift set which first of all comes
with three products it comes with the
exfoliator
the actual like self-tanner
and then the tan like maintainer or
extender it's just like an acne lotion
and also it came with this adorable
beach bag which is just clear and it's
pink and orange and I actually brought
this to Florida with me and they were
super great so I use this at the beach
and it's like the perfect size and I
don't know I like this a lot and this
gift set of course I will link in the
downbar it will be like the first link
that you see so you have the same exact
thing that I got and you can buy it for
$39.99 which is an awesome deal and I
actually think they might run out and
buy more of this stuff and my mom's
actually gonna buy something too because
man I want it because I love it so much
so yeah now I'm gonna talk you through
the steps of each product and how you
use it so first off you have the body
gel exfoliator and just green and this
is basically an Excel
just to put all over your body and it's
just gonna remove all the dead skin
cells and stuff like that because you
want to start on like fresh skin when
you're applying on self-tanner so that's
why it's really cool that they include
their own you know exfoliator so you
don't have to go out and buy one and you
know like experiment which one's your
favorite because this stuff is awesome
and I know that first thing you think I
know that I haven't used too much of
this I used to about once and that is
because I got these products like two
days a day before I went to Florida so I
did use this like right before I went to
Florida I exfoliated my body with this
stuff and it's seriously awesome and I
haven't used it since then just because
you know I don't really want to
exfoliate off like my real tan and stuff
like that from Florida but basically
this stuff is awesome it's just like a
body gel with little teeny pebbles in it
and it smells like mint gum it smells
amazing and when you use it it's so
refreshing because I don't know it's
just like the mint eNOS just makes it
that much awesome err I don't know I
love this stuff though and it looks like
that so it smells super amazing like all
these stuff just smells so so good which
is like an important thing because
usually self-tanner smells so bad so
that's like definitely one of the
biggest things that I noticed so this
stuff smells really good it's really
refreshing and it's first to exfoliate
your whole body this so now I'm going to
show you clip oh I'm like how I washed
my leg but I mean it's kind of simple
you just kind of wash your biped but
I'll show you a clip of it now
so the next step that you have to do is
to use the actual self-tanning lotion
and mine is in dark or ultra dark and
this is how it looks and it's basically
all you do is once you get a shower just
like Pat yourself down the towel and
apply this all over your body and I'm
gonna show you clip on how to do that
afterwards but this stuff smells so so
so so good first let me show you the
color of it this might scare you when
you first see it yeah
it is like dark brown but it smells so
good I can smell this stuff all day
it's like fruity mainly it smells like
cherries but it doesn't smell like
cherry medicine it just kind of smells
like cherry lollipops that's what it
smells like and it smells so so so good
and the color might scare you a little
bit but it's actually a lot more easier
to use this stuff than like a white tank
motion because when you put it on your
legs and stuff you know where you're
applying it because it's dark and it it
doesn't like stay that dark it just kind
of blends into your skin and then makes
it look tanner
so don't be scared about the whole like
color difference and if if you're super
Pam you don't know which color which
shade to use I still recommend getting
ultra dark because the first time you
use it it doesn't make like that big of
like an extreme difference that it's
like well BAM you know don't be scared
about that or anything so I definitely
recommend getting the ultra dark one
because I was pale when I use this since
I used it like before I went to Florida
and yeah this stuff is pretty awesome
you just apply on your skin normally I
definitely recommend using gloves when
you do this because the first time I
used it I just use my bare hands which
was a big mistake because whenever you
use tangos on your hands I forgot why
but like your hands soak up the most
lotion so the next day your hands are
gonna be like brown like your hands are
gonna be like the tennis part of your
body so that's why I definitely
recommend just getting some like latex
gloves disposable latex gloves for my
Target or Walgreens I don't know but I
definitely recommend using these just so
that you know you don't get like
whatever lotion on your hands and stuff
like that so that's why I like using
these and I recommend that and so now
I'm gonna show you guys a quick clip of
just me like applying it on my legs or
whatever but you'll see that it wasn't
wearing the gloves because that's the
first time I ever used it and that was a
big mistake
so yeah you can watch that now
so the last product that you use which
is the third step is the tan moisturizer
maintainer it's also extends your tan
and yeah it's practice it's basically
just a lotion so looks like this and
what you do the process is well what
they recommend doing is when you take a
shower you know slate your body and this
is at night time and then right when you
got a shower just put on the you know
self-tanning lotion and then sleep on it
and then the next morning they recommend
to then use the maintainer so that's
what I do so I'll like I'll use these
two first products and the night and
then the next morning I'll use the
maintainer and basically what this does
is it just moisturize your skin and you
know keeps that keeps the tan just kind
of locked into your skin so that doesn't
fade or anything which I thought was a
really smart idea for them so you don't
have to constantly you don't use it and
they recommend using this you can use
this every single day as a daily tanner
I mean well lotion if you want to and
then this you can just use a couple
times a week like twice a week once a
week three times a week it doesn't
really matter just kind of like personal
preference so this stuff is just like
this it's like kind of like white lotion
I don't know it's kind of like yeah it's
just but it's kind of greenish too I
don't know it's just like a regular
lotion this stuff kind of smells like
sounds green that's the only thing the
other two products aren't really good
this just kind of it just smells like
sunscreen or like any regular tanning
lotion I guess I don't know so if I
smell this isn't like that amazing so
that's the only thing that like kind of
stinks is that it doesn't really smell
as good as the other two which I mean I
don't really care just kind of smells
like sunscreen if you don't like that
then I don't know but I'm fine with it
and you just apply this all over your
body
and you're basically done and you're
gonna have an amazing summer glow you
know for a really long time as long as
you keep using the maintainer and yeah
that's basically it so I definitely
definitely definitely once I finish
these products I'm definitely going to
be getting more and you know using it
during the summer because honestly this
stuff is probably the best self tanner
I have ever ever ever ever used it
totally tops off all the store brands
that I've ever used
like Jergens and L'Oreal and Neutrogena
and stuff like that definitely
definitely recommend you guys to try
this out when I hope this video just
kind of informed you guys a little bit
more because I'm pretty sure you guys
have seen videos on these products but
um you know it's good to have different
opinions from you know different people
and I'm just so so so so so happy so
make sure to check out you know the cell
laboratories website down in the downbar
and you can I'll have like the link
provided to get the same exact thing
that I got so it's a little bit more
easier you know and this is your split

and yeah so um I don't know that's
really all I have to say today so I hope
you guys enjoyed today's video and I'll
