today I'm going to be the seedless now
today I'm going to be doing a spring
haul for you guys so I've got a few bee
products and clothing items and
accessories and yeah I've just got a
whole lot of stuff to show you guys so
let's get into it I'm gonna start off
with the beauty products that I
purchased so first off I got a face
cleansing sponge and I wanted to thank
you guys because I featured the jhula
face sponge in my April favorites video
and I asked you guys if any other
companies sold similar sponges and a
bunch of you guys counted about the
Basia bastia does anyone know how to
pronounce this brand I got this from
Sephora it is a cleansing sponge with
bamboo charcoal that perfects your pores
and it's made for combination to oily
skin I'm very excited to try it out so
thank you everyone next up I purchased
in eyebrow products and if you guys
watch basically any of my makeup
tutorials then you would know that I
like to fill in my eyebrows with a
powder and an angled brush but I
actually decided to step out of my
comfort zone try something new for a
change
and pick up me a Nastasia brow is a
skinny brow pencil okay technically I've
used brow pencils before but I never
really got into them so maybe it'll be a
different story with this one but it
looks like this it's very very skinny I
wanna end you have a spoolie to brush
out your eyebrows and on the other end
you have the pencil I haven't tried it
out yet but from just watching it on my
hand I can tell that it's very pigmented
but it doesn't smudge which is pretty
perfect bra strap is falling next up I
got a lip product and this is the Dior
Addict
lip glow I have heard so many people
rave about this prod
so I decided to pick it up it's a tinted
lip balm and it's supposed to change
colors when it hits different
temperatures or something technical like
that it's also really fun to open and
close this because it like clicks and
every chapstick should be like this next
up I got an eye liner and this is the
tarte inner rim liner in the shade
brightener i've also heard a bunch of
people talk about this product as well
I'm honestly surprised that it took me
this long to pick it up because I've
been meaning to for like months it's
basically just a skin tone - eye liner
that you put on your inner waterline to
open up your eyes and make them appear
bigger I really like it
I will tell you guys that the last thing
that I got from Sephora was a Sephora
brand eyeliner sharpener cool stuff fun
next up I got one thing from lush
because I went to the store to buy a few
things for my mother on Mother's Day and
to be honest the things that I got for
my mom were so much cooler than what I
bought for myself
but I figured I might as well show you
guys anyways I bought myself a bath balm
and no it's not one of the prettier ones
it's very simple looking but it smelled
really really good I think this is the
blackberry scented one I'm not sure but
it's this light lilac II purple color I
used to never be a bath person but
recently I've just been getting into
taking baths because they're very
relaxing who knew right it's fun to
pamper yourself I now get why girls do
it and now let's get into the clothing
portion of this video which is going to
be the majority of this video so first
off I'm going to show you guys two
things that I got from Toby calm my
boyfriend's first thing that I got was
this crap top right here I can't really
hold it up there you go I just thought
it looked really cool because it's kind
of structured it's got a really cool
geometric triangle feel to it I don't
know how to explain it but it just
caught my eye so I was like hey you know
I'm
and I'm holding you in my arms love
story the claudius loose key next up I
bought a skirt that I wanted to pair
with the top that I should just rush oh
my god I literally cannot talk it looks
like this it's a skater skirt and it's
black and white with flowers all over it
I just thought it was really cool
next up I have one thing from Topshop
and it is this giraffe or over here it
is all leather and it's really cool
because the pattern kind of changes so
as you can see on the bottom it's got
like this quilted look and then at the
top it just has like simple paneling
right here so it was just pretty unique
next up I've got two things from PacSun
the first is a pair of overalls or short
hauls whatever you call them right
chortles I wore them in my last video
and a bunch of you guys asked where I
purchased it so it's from PacSun it's
light washed and it just goes down to a
short Jean love love love and yeah I'm
really excited about this I think the
overall trend is super cute even though
I did say that I was over that trend in
my Sun Times article every last thing I
got was another pair of shorts these are
just all black their mid waisted not
really high-waisted a little bit lower
but I thought they were really cute
because they have this really adorable
lace trim on that I'm not really lace I
don't know it's like scalloped or some
so you really can never go wrong with a
pair of black shorts next up I want to
show you guys a few of the swimsuits
that I got from triangle comm all I can
say about that website is yes yes to
every single thing on that website they
are doing everything right every single
bikini is so beautiful I just want all
of them so I want to show you guys three
different pieces literally yes like
everything just yes yes that's okay the
first one looks like this
so I think this one is called the Winnie
style the top looks like this it's black
and white so it's just got white lining
and the black is this really cool like
mesh material so it looks really sporty
and stuff and the bottoms that it goes
with are super simple they're just this
really pretty bright minty color I just
think this will look so so so pretty
with a summer tan so excited about that
one
the next bathing suit would probably
have to be my favorite it looks like
this the top is also mesh like the one
that I showed you guys I believe this
style is called alie the top is just
triangle it's got white with black mesh
over it
and the bottoms are just super bright
peach they're just like the ones that I
just showed you guys it kind of feels
like scuba fabric you're like what suit
fabric hell it's kind of thicker this is
what it feels like so it feels really
like sturdy and the last one is this
black indie bikini why oh my god there's
a bug on my life but I decided to get
this one because it looks extremely like
leather which is such a cool effect on a
bathing suit in my opinion I cannot wait
to wear this one so I'll link them down
below if you guys want to check them out
100% recommend it because like I said
before just yes next up I want to talk
about another company that is just very
near and dear to my heart
I discovered misguided calm I would say
about three months ago or something I've
never heard anyone else on YouTube ever
haul clothing items from this store or
ever talk about it so for the longest
time I just kind of kept to myself
didn't tell anyone where I got it I'll
just be like oh yeah mr. random like UK
website but I could not contain myself I
just have to show you guys a few things
that I've recently gotten that website
is literally my style in a nutshell and
it's just so misguided if you happen to
be watching this hall and you want to
work with a beauty guru on YouTube who's
18 years old and lives in a room with
blue walls and has brown hair my name is
Claudia misguided has really cool
separates so I've got two different ones
that I wanted to show you guys the first
one looks like this it's super crazy
which I love so much the top looks like
this it's a high neckline it's got black
strings as these straps and it's just
yellow and black and white and floral
over then the skirt that comes with is a
midi skirt so it goes past the knees and
at the top it just has really cool black
like panels on the sides so I thought
this looked really cool and I can not
wait to wear it because it's so cool I
just look cool so many times the next
separate that I got is also super crazy
and I might wear this to beautycon I'm
not really sure yet but the top is just
like the previous one and this one comes
with a shorter skirt so it's got the
same pattern but it's just flowy and
short and beautiful I've got two more
shirts to show you guys so the first one
looks like this my background just
unblurred I will fix that shortly but I
thought it was cool because the sleeves
are as long as the top it's more like a
crop top but as you can see the sleeves
are a little bit longer so I thought
that was just a really cool detail and
yeah I think this will match with a lot
it's just very different
the last item from misguided is this top
right here it's got mesh sleeves and
it's just white and cropped super cute
simple but still unique at the same time
actually I'm lying to guys I have one
more thing that I want to show you but
it is a skirt and it looks I like ideas
I'm sorry I'm so annoying
the pattern is houndstooth and as you
can see it has this nice little you know
thing going over and
it's really cute we really really like
this skirt I kind of want to wear this
one to beautycon as well
the next clothing store that I want to
feature is the Windsor and I've got a
few pieces so the first one is a
necklace it looks like this it's silver
and it's multi chained which is a huge
trend at the moment I just thought it
looked really really cool and bad I love
to say that I don't know I'll just take
off the last word in case I don't really
wear a statement jewelry that often but
I thought this necklace was right up my
alley
and I can definitely see myself wearing
this with a bunch of different outfits
the next thing that I got is pretty
simple it's just a cropped t-shirt but I
thought it was cool because it's
color-block so it's white and grey and
then black so it'll just be a nice
casual top to wear in the spring and
summer times and lastly I got a pair of
shoes which look like this
as you can tell they're pretty similar
to my black go Jane heels that also have
the little ridges at the bottom which I
really really love I think it looks so
cool it's just a nice little extra
detail on the bottom of the shoe and
yeah I really like the thick strap at
the top all in all it's just a perfect
shoe it's also super high which is great
because I love being tall I've got one
last thing to show you guys and it is a
dress but it's not only just a normal
dress it is actually my junior prom
dress for this year I will not have time
to film a get ready with me video for
this prom but don't worry guys I will be
filming one because I'm also going to
senior prom in June that's the one that
I mentioned in my last video so I'm
gonna be filming it get ready with me
video for that from just cuz I've got a
lot going on at the moment so I don't
want to stress myself out with having to
you know take the time to fill myself
getting ready and all that stuff but I
did want to show you guys the dress that
I'm going to be wearing this dress is
from BCBG and Max Azria but it has one
strap that goes on the
shoulder and it also has a little
triangle cutout in the middle right here
in the front so it's very simple but I
think it just kind of screamed my name
you like this is something that I would
just totally wear like I said to Fogg to
my friends and everyone was just like
yeah that is a Claudia dress
I totally saw that coming that is what
I'm going to be wearing it to prom this
weekend and that is everything for
