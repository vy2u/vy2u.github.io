doing my monthly favorites video I
quickly want to mention two different
things as you guys can see I chopped my
hair it was probably like don't adhere
it maybe before I cut it but I cut it a
few days ago and I'm so obsessed with it
I forgot how easy short hair is to work
with like literally the more you mess
with it the cuter it looks it's amazing
so all I have to do this curl like five
pieces and then just kind of like
scrunch the rest and it's just it's
beautiful I love it I love it so much
let me know what you guys think about my
new you do if I should go a little bit
shorter or not but as of right now I'm
very happy with this length and it's
great it's been great if you guys are
wondering about me my hair I don't know
the next thing that I quickly want to
mention it was that I recently changed
my Twitter handle and my Instagram so
Claudia's life is dead it's gone she
died it is now Claudia Saluki so yes I
am pulling off my mask is that a good
expression I am pulling off my Hannah
Montana wig and revealing my last name
so yes my full name is Claudia so loose
key I decided to change my Twitter to at
Claudia's whiskey as well as my
Instagram because as I start creating
more videos and stuff I don't really
want to brand myself as Claudia's life
I'd rather just have my first name in my
last name because I want to be known for
that but I am keeping beyond Beauty
stars so that's the same thing it's just
my Twitter my Instagram so I did not
just delete my social media accounts I
just changed the username so that is
what I did this month now let's get on
with what I loved this month so I'm
going to be changing it up I'm not going
to start off with beauty products
because I don't feel like it today I'm
gonna start off with my two favorite
Fitness related stuff that I've been
enjoying this month so my first favorite
are my new gym shoes I have been using
my mom's crummy like Nike Shox
ten year old gym shoes for longest time
and I
I decide to invest in real gym shoes so
I got these Nike something inside of me
is telling me that there's a 5.0
somewhere in the title of these shoes
it's like 5.0 free runs I'm pretty sure
it's like the 5.0 free run Nike shoes
but they look like this these are
actually very popular shoes I always see
them on like social media and stuff but
they're also very comfortable and very
cute so the only thing I recommend with
these shoes is they do run a little bit
smaller and when you're working out your
feet tend to swell so if you plan on
buying these then I definitely recommend
going at least half a size up because
overall it'll just be a lot more
comfortable and you'll have some space
for your feet so these have been great
love them my next Fitness related
favourites is a sports bra and I have
just become obsessed with the Victoria's
Secret sports bras and I really like
them because Victoria Secret makes a
bunch of different types of sports bras
depending on how much support you need
whether you're doing like high intensity
workouts like running or jumping or
something like that or maybe more low
intensity workouts like yoga or
something so I don't know the name of
this I was looking at the tag and all it
says is vs sport this is what it looks
like first of all the color is just
awesome
it's like a neon peachy orange color and
it has accents of grey on it so the
reason why I like this sports bra is
because it doesn't have like any wire or
anything but it does have like a shape
to it so it's super comfortable and I
also really like how they have the
adjustable hooking strap in the back so
that you can choose like how tight you
want to be I definitely recommend
checking out their sports bras because
they're super comfortable and they are
all adorable as you can see just from
this one but yeah I own a bunch of
different ones and this one is my
favorite my next favorite is a body
lotion and I may have talked about this
in a past favourites video but I know
that
I have not talked about this one
specifically so this is the Vaseline
spray and goat
moisturizer and I've been loving these
spray moisturizers for the longest time
but I recently decided to try out the
new Koko radiant non-greasy one so this
one kind of smells like cocoa butter so
I can definitely 100% say that I am
completely obsessed with these smell and
just overall feel of this lotion because
all you have to do is just spray it into
skin rub it in and it soaks up within
seconds and they don't leave you feeling
all like sticky and wet and whatever you
just feel soft and nice after it so I
definitely definitely recommend trying
these out onto the next sticking with
the moisturizing topic I've been really
liking the first a beauty ultra Repair
Cream and this is for your face now
since the weather here in Chicago has
been just awful honest it's just so cold
my skin has been getting a very very dry
so I've been really liking this product
because it is a little bit thicker so it
definitely moisturizes your skin a lot
more so I really like using this in the
morning before I put on my makeup as
well as right before I go to bed so it
just comes in this tub and a little goes
a long way with this stuff so I barely
made a dent into it and this entire
thing is full it also has a very faint
scent it's just very fresh and subtle so
you don't really notice it when you're
putting it on your face but overall I
just really like it it's allergy tested
fragrance free and safe for sensitive
skin check it out at your nearest
birthday beauty counter so now I'm going
to get into my beauty related makeup
favorites so I actually have a lot of
NYX products that I've been loving
because over la IMATS
I attended a NYX event they were giving
out these huge goodie bags filled with
the NYX makeup so I was able to try a
bunch of different products so first off
I've been really liking the NYX BB cream
and this is in the shade and natural and
I've been really liking this because
it's really different from the other BB
creams that I've tried I feel like this
one has a lot more coverage to it which
I really like and I also just really
like the shade of this product so it's a
little bit more moisturizing than a
regular foundation but I feel like this
product in particular has the same
amount of coverage as a normal
foundation so it's kind of the best of
both worlds it's great and I've just
been really happy we've been really
happy together lately so we've formed a
great relationship together and it's
been good I'm so weird I okay
I've also been really liking of their
mascaras and this is where it just gets
a little overwhelming because we got a
bunch of different mascaras and they're
often the same line I'm figuring because
they all have the same packaging about
each mascara does a different thing so I
haven't really tried every single one
yet just because it takes me a long time
to get through mascaras so here they are
but so far I've been really liking the
NYX XXL sorry that was Aspen anyways
I've been really liking it there XXL
mascara I'm wearing it today and I
really like it because the wand is very
big and at first it was a little
intimidating because it's just it's very
large as you can see but I really like
how it goes on it doesn't clump up at
all and I really like the way that it
made my eyelashes look let me know if
you guys have tried any of these and
which one you like best because I have
not tried all of them yet but so far
I've been really liking them and I've
been really impressed my foot fell
asleep you know when you get those like
that tingly feeling and your feet yeah I
have that right now anyways it's getting
off topic I have three lip products that
I've been really liking and the first
two are NYX butter glosses and if you
guys have been watching me for the past
year ish you would know that I'm
completely obsessed with these lip
glosses I just really really like the
texture of them as well as the
pigmentation so I have two different
shades that I've been loving lately
it's funny because now that I'm looking
at it they are complete polar opposites
so the first one which is the darker one
is in the shade devil's food cake and I
like this one because it reminds me a
lot of the Mak rebel lipstick which you
guys know that I also really love but
it's a little bit darker and just the
fact that it came in this lip gloss my
favorite lip gloss got me a super pumped
and super excited I really have been
loving the very shiny dark lip because
normally people go for a matte look when
they're doing dark lips but I've been
feeling liking the glossy shiny dark
lips lately so this one achieves just
that and the next one I've been really
liking which I'm wearing on my lips
right now this is in the shade of
fortune cookie and it's just your
perfect nude lip gloss so underneath
this lip gloss I'm wearing there butter
lipstick does anyone see what's
happening here butter gloss final
lipstick I'm obsessed with these as well
this is the lipstick and sugar wafer and
it's just your typical nude lipstick my
next beauty related favorites is the
makeup forever eye shadow in the shade
star power powder just kidding star
powder yes oh you guys might be thinking
well what is so special with this eye
shadow it just looks like white eye
shadow but it's actually very unique so
when you look at it through the
packaging it just looks very like white
and sparkly but the second you put it
onto your eyes or anywhere on your skin
it immediately creates like the
prettiest rose gold looking reflex to it
it's crazy like it literally changes
colors when you place on your skin yeah
it just turns into this super pretty
like rose gold shimmery eyeshadow but
it's still a little bit white so it's
great for the inner corners of your eyes
my next favorite is a fashion related
favorite and I actually bought this for
a look for last video that I did with
lovelorn elizabeth here on youtube which
those videos have not been yet I have
yet to edit that video
so we have been very very lazy with
getting those up but expect those videos
because I'm really excited for how
they're gonna turn out so anyways I got
this purse for our look for Less video
and I got it from forever 21 for about
six dollars because it was on sale and I
have actually been using this bag so
much I bought it - I met with me and
used it pretty much every single day and
it's overall just a really cute bag I
don't think it looks like six dollars
it's like the perfect size for just
everyday carrying your gum and phone and
wallet and all that stuff I'm not sure
if you guys can still buy it since it
was on sale but maybe you still can
I've got to kind of snacky related
favorites so the first one is a flavor
of gum and it is the Stride sour patch
gum oh my god whoever came up with this
was so smart I threw out the actual
packaging because I just store it in
this little like mercury jar and they
taste exactly like sour patch kids um so
I definitely recommend trying out that
gun because it is life-changing
it's amazing and you will never look at
gum the same way my next favorite is a
soda which is so weird to say because I
normally I don't really drink a lot of
soda like on the regular I don't know
but I have been really liking the vivia
zero-calorie soda lately just because
I'm one of those people who hates
drinking their sugars and their calories
and all of that like I'd rather just
drink a bunch of water and then eat I
love eating okay that is the point that
I'm trying to come across right now I
guess but I really like these sodas
because every once in a while I just
crave something really sweet
and I like these because they don't have
sugar in them they don't have artificial
sweeteners it's sweetened with natural
stevia which is a sweetener that I use
in my teas and you know things like that
and it's
I mean it's a zero on everything sugar
fat everything calories this specific
one is in the flavor cream soda which
I've never tried until I've tried this
one it is so so sweet but I have the
biggest sweet tooth ever so this stuff
just hits the spot for me
now what last but not least I wanted to
mention a few music related favorites
because I forgot to do this in last
month's favorites and all of you guys
yelled at me so I'm just going to look
through and talk about the music that
I've been liking it so the first song
that I've been listening to religiously
lately is the beauty surrounds by houses
and I just love the way this song starts
out I just let's all take a moment of
silence and listen to it oh my god my
friends are ruining it sorry
it's like a kind of slower song the next
one is a lot slower it is by the same
band houses and it is big light it's
really good I actually found this
through Kaylee Mackenzie here in YouTube
she actually has an amazing taste of
music so I always loved watching her
music playlist videos and stuff but this
is it
I never note to do when I'm just sitting
here listening to this but yeah I've
been really liking that song the next
song is a little bit more upbeat and
actually used it in my last tutorial
which i think was my last video and it
is you make me a pie of youichi and it
just it's a good pump up song so that's
why I like it that is it for today's
video I hope you guys enjoyed it and I
will be seeing you for a new one very
soon bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
