laughing I don't know right for us I'm
not saying it right mm okay hi everyone
so I got very excited when I
strawberryelectric 48 here on YouTube
tagged me to do the I Heart fault tags
so that is what I'm doing today the
first question is what is your favorite
fall lip product and you guys know how I
am with my new lips pretty much wear
them all day every day year round but
recently I've been trying to kind of
branch out into different colors
especially dark lip colors so I've been
trying to kind of give a little bit more
variety in my lip colors so I actually
have to to show you guys today the first
one I'm wearing on my lips right now and
it is the Rimmel London moisture renew
lip gloss and this is in the shade
purple rescue there's a swatch of it
right there it's very very shiny and
moisturizing so I really really like
these lip glosses and i think i'm going
to try different colors and them and the
second one that i want to show you guys
is a Revlon lip butter and I don't know
why it has taken me this long to try
them out but i recently got two of them
and this one I've just been out during
this is in the shade gumdrop and it is
literally a light purple color it is so
pretty on the lips so I have a swatch of
it right here it's a little bit sheer
but it just gives a very nice just light
purple II like flush on my lips and I've
just really been liking it overall I've
just been really liking like purpley
lips for the fall so those would have to
be my two favorites the next question is
what is your favorite fall nail polish
and it would probably have to be this
brown nail polish right here I got this
in one of my glossybox it's from the
brand I don't know how to pronounce that
there you go and it's in the shape taint
so yeah it's just like a dark chocolaty
color it has no shimmer sparkles in it
which is what I like their question is
what is your favorite star
fall drink I actually don't have one I
mean I've tried like the salted caramel
one and the pumpkin spice latte that
everyone like freaks out about and I
like them they're good but you may be 44
actually introduced me to the white
chocolate mocha which is so good so that
is definitely like my favorite drink at
Starbucks but I mean I don't know I
think I'm more into like the Christmas
drinks like the peppermint mocha and
stuff like that so i don't know i just
don't really have an answer for that one
number four is what is your favorite
fall candle and it is not leaves and i
am so proud to say that because everyone
always says that their favorite candles
leaves the scent is called apple crumble
and i am obsessed with this smell it
smells so good it's can't describe it
just it smells like apples and just a
false end it's it kind of smells like if
you took the leaves candle and like
mixed it with green apple like that's
what this kind of smells like and I love
the smell of green apples so yeah this
is this is for sure my favorite the next
question is what is your favorite fall
scarf or accessory of course I left yet
school in my locker but it's just a
white scarf I think it's from like
abercrombie fitch or something but it's
very plain and I like it because it
matches with a lot but I'm sorry I can't
show you guys cuz it's my locker the
next question is haunted house is
haunted hayride or haunted corn maze and
I actually went to a haunted corn maze
and haunted house last night with a
couple my friends and I actually blogged
to and I think that will be up by now so
if you want to check out that vlog i
will link it down below and also linked
my second channel down below but i would
have to say a haunted house because i
don't know i just i love haunted houses
i think they're so fun they always look
cool to their very cool be decorated and
i don't know it's just I like feeling
scared today's wasn't that scary but I i
love getting scared it's it's great the
next question is what is your favorite
Halloween movie Halloween Town like for
sure hands down
I honestly grew up with those movies I
definitely like the last one the least
because they changed the main character
and I think that was kind of stupid but
I just I think I liked the first to the
best I don't really remember I haven't
seen it this year yet but i probably
will see it on disney channel soon
probably like tonight or something but I
I love those movies they're so good the
next question is what is your favorite
candy to eat on Halloween this actually
took me a while to think about but it
would for sure have to be the green
apple like caramel covered volley pops
do you guys know what they're called I
don't really remember but it's just like
green apple lollipops and they have
caramel around them and it's just so so
amazing number 9 asks what are you
dressing up as for Halloween and I don't
know yet so we kind of have a bit of a
dilemma because my friends and I are
we're just way too cool to go
trick-or-treating which kind of sucks
because i love getting free candy but we
didn't go last year and I doubt we're
gonna go this year maybe well couple of
us will go just for like fun but um yeah
we don't really go trick-or-treating
anymore usually we just have like
Halloween parties at people's houses but
I don't think anyone's throwing a
halloween party this year I mean as of
right now nobody is which is really sad
because I really really want to dress up
I love Halloween costumes and I just I
think it's so fun so someone better have
a halloween party last question is what
is your favorite thing about fall and it
would have to be everything about fall
first off I love the fashion I love
wearing you know those big sweaters and
scarves and boots and then taking the
tall socks and scrunching them down to
peek through your boots and you know all
that stuff so I love the clothes during
the fall season also i love drinking hot
apple cider i love just like all the
fall candle smells and the leaves
outside looks so pretty also i like
obviously halloween and all the haunted
houses and just honestly just everything
about fall on thanksgiving of course
food and fright fest I love six legs so
much so that concludes my tag today
you guys enjoyed it and I will see you
guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
