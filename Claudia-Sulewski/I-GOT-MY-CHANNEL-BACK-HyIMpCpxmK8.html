noticed that my channel got hacked
everything got removed and more than
half you guys probably didn't even know
about this but yeah I got hacked about a
week ago or two or something like that
and I made a new channel and it was like
beyond me to start with to ours and
stuff but I got this channel back well
obviously because I'm making a video on
it but I just wanted to say that I'm
back and I'm going to be making videos
on this channel so yeah I got everything
back I change I switched all the emails
and change the passwords and I'm super
super super excited um so also um so I
had like a brain freezer um also the
hacker who was on my account here so
sorry if any of you guys got a personal
message from this account um like saying
if you want to get 50 more subs go on
this and then like you get hacked
that was not me that was the hacker
because I did sign into here and I got
tons of personal messages saying like
how could you do that I'm like that
wasn't me okay I promise you guys start
for the parents and stuff but oh my god
I'm so happy that I got my channel back
and um on my channel that I made before
um
beyond Beauty star with two R's that was
like my new channel um hold on I'm
making a video sorry and um what's a
call was I can say see because it thanks
mom okay um right so on this channel I'm
just going to quickly upload a bunch of
videos um just so that I have some
videos up on this channel I'm going to
try to upload all of them but I want to
do this super fast because I had to do
that on my old channel so I'm probably
going to upload like five videos in one
day so sorry for flooding your
subscription boxes you're going to get a
lot of videos from me but they're going
to be old ones so sorry about that I
just really want to upload them reupload
enim
I mean and yeah so I'm back this is my
channel um my other channel beyond
Beauty star is going to be my backup
channel so I'm not really going to use
that anymore but second channel is all
good I'm still using that don't worry so
it's back to normal how it used to be
and I've been using my hands a lot in
this video so yeah that's all I want to
say thank you so much for all the help
and support and this channel is back and
I'm so happy
