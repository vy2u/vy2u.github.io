racing this okay it doesn't really work
sorry but I'm like definitely using this
for this video hello everyone welcome
back today we are doing a favorites
video I was actually this morning trying
to look back on when I last posted one
and it was when I first moved here it's
been so long so I'm really excited I'm
gonna show you guys basically my winter
obsessions or different things that I've
been enjoying for the winter time the
first thing that I want to mention is
it's it's kind of a little it's a little
self promo shout out you guys I came out
with a phone case you guys know wildfire
cases I've loved their cases for so many
years now and we've always wanted to
collaborate on a case together and it
finally happened and it's so cute it's
like a sketched out white rose and it's
all thorny and we decided to go with
like a skintone background because it
kind of bounced out the girly flowers so
we kind of use like a neutral color I
feel like this is very me and so I'm so
so happy with how it came out if you
guys want to get this case for yourself
then I'll obviously have it linked down
below you can get it for the plus size
but also you can get it for the regular
iPhone 6 7 or 8 I'm literally never
taking this off my phone ever so yeah
you want to match I talked about this in
my holiday gift guide but you guys I am
obsessed with oil diffusers I got this
little one from Whole Foods basically
it's just a little clay vase and then
underneath you've got your little user
you just put water and you just put
drops of any sort of oil I've been doing
peppermint lately because it's the
holiday time it's very cooling but you
can also do it at night time with like
lavender and yeah you just stick this
over put water in and it just diffuses
oil into the air
my first Beauty favorites are these
concealers these are the Tarte shaped
ape concealers I cannot believe that it
took me this long to try these out
because I feel like everyone on YouTube
has talked about them all my friends use
them I was blown away the fur
I'm using these a little goes a long way
with this they're very creamy very very
pigmented I go in between medium and
light medium and just next makeup
favorite we've got a highlighter this is
the bareMinerals invisible glow it's
honestly I feel like the name of it is
very representative of what it looks
like because it kind of like it looks
like it'd be crazy and shimmery and
stuff in the packaging on your face it
just looks so like subtle and glowy and
like the perfect amount where it's you
can't really tell that you're like
wearing a highlight it just looks like
the Sun is just beautifully catching all
the right spots on your face and yeah
and I think with the winter time too you
don't want to look too crazy glittery
and stuff so it's a nice kind of
in-between of like hi I'm still glowing
hi I'm here my highlight is definitely
there but like she's a little more
humble I mean next up we've got a face
mask I feel like at this point like what
is a claudius favorites video without a
fresh product I'm just obsessed with
fresh so much this is the Lotus
Youth preserve rescue mask and basically
that it's kind of like their five-minute
facials so you just have to put on your
face for five minutes this is what it
looks like inside so it has little like
seaweed bits in it and a bunch of like
little exfoliating ingredients but also
it just helps to kind of like rejuvenate
and like wake up the skin and I'm
obsessed with it I actually don't know
if this is available just yet I looked
on their site and it says coming soon so
I'm gonna link it for you guys it might
you know if you have yet but I think it
supposed to come out this year my next
favorite is a trend and I have a
specific hair that I'm showing you guys
but just in general I have been obsessed
with wide legged pants it's on at this
point it's all I wear and you guys can
see that on my Instagram I just think it
looks so firing it look
good and so I have these jeans there's
Levi's but I got them a turban and they
are just high-waisted they button up and
they are super wide at the bottom and oh
my goodness you guys put on some booties
it makes your legs look so long and like
your waist is small oh my gosh it's so
great whoo all right my next favorite is
a blankets because what would a winter
obsessions video be without like
something cozy and cuddly this thing you
guys is oh my gosh every time anyone
comes over like they immediately go to
this blanket and snuggle in it the
reason why it's so special you're like
Claudia it's just a blanket why I will
tell you why it's called their foot sac
blanket and the reason why is because on
one end and the blanket you've got a
little pocket for your friggin feet it's
like a sleeping bag for your feet so
then when you're cold your feet don't
like you know fall out of the blanket
they stay nice and toasty oh my god you
could sew potato sack racing this okay
it doesn't really work okay sorry but
I'm like definitely using this for this
video my next favorite is a tea I love
tea so much I feel like I've talked
about this in a vlog or something but
you guys this is the greatest tasting
tea ever
it's from nume organic tea and it's
their white rose white tea and fragrant
rose buds
honestly it tastes exactly what it
sounds like it would taste it literally
tastes like roses if you could eat roses
you know how like when you smell
something you're like that's probably
what it tastes like that's kind of
what's happening here but in a good way
definitely like a floral beverage which
weirdly is like a really nice situation
before I get into my music favorites I
quickly want to get into one of my new
favorite shows which I'm in oh my gosh
it's called versus I think my versus
behind the scenes in bloopers video will
already be up if it is I'll have it
linked down below it was so much fun we
shot it for like five weeks it's
basically a show about a girls lacrosse
team and two rival players are forced to
be on the same team
it focuses on like working together and
building each other up but also everyone
has like their own individual conflicts
I love my character storyline I think
it's so cool and yeah it was just so
much fun it was the greatest experience
ever and the show came out so freakin
good it's on go 90 it was produced by
awesomeness and Gatorade which like so
cool what Gatorade oh my gosh I yeah
yeah now lastly I want to go through
some music favorites because I know that
you guys like love when I bring this
stuff in so we're just going to play
them on my phone for short fragments so
that we don't get coffee right in my
first music favorite is lose it by
swimmers I love this song the whole like
meaning behind it is really cute it's
about like this girl having good taste
music
it's just so cute I love it it's so good
my next music favorites is let it happen
by Tam and Paula
but the Soulwax room exit this is
literally a 9 minute song it's so good
for like when you're driving it's funky
it's catchy and it's 9 minutes long so
like it doesn't just like end after 2
minutes nearly I gotta like replay it
like you live through it you know what I
mean my next favorite is called new
theory and it's by the band washed-out
it's just I love it
love it my next favorite is
uncomfortable by wallows great band
Braden
so cute and uncomfortable is my favorite
song by them
is one part where like whistling comes
in and I just lose it
anyways yeah great song
my next favorite it's an old song but
I'm loving it it's called is this it by
The Strokes I think this might be my
favorite song by them
loving them last but not least this song
so beautiful oh my gosh the one and only
Olivia Brian no love this song is so so
beautiful when when she first released
it like I I mean I had already heard it
and so I feel like that's what I'm
saying every single song so those are
all my music favorites if you guys want
