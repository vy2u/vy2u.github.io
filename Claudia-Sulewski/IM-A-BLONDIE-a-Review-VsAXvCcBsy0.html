oh my god I freaking like going crazy
every time I look in the mirror I just
get so happy and I'm like whoa like
what's that mean because I've always
wanted this hair color
and today I'm going to show you guys and
kind of go through the steps of how I
got this hair color because I did this
at home I did this all by myself I only
had my dad help me at one point what
I'll tell you one otherwise I did all
this myself yesterday and if you notice
it's kind of like highlights everywhere
like legit and I didn't just turn my
whole head blonde because I says clothes
specifically said I didn't want to do
that I just wanted to start out with
like highlights that's what I did
yesterday and you might be thinking how
did you do that at home that seems
really hard it was actually really easy
and okay so so this is gonna be a review
and no nobody paid me or gave me this
for free I bought this at Walgreens for
like seven dollars yesterday okay so
this look right here this is like this
hair is like salon like on the box it
says like salon quality air and they're
not kidding when they say that because
it honestly looks like I got this have
done at the hair salon except this
costed seven dollars and about like five
hours and I'll tell you why it takes a
long time as opposed to like $200 and a
salon okay so basically what I used
yesterday on my hair is the Revlon frost
and glow highlighting kits
I saw many videos I saw about every
single video talking about this product
and I saw a bunch of reviews online it
was kind of like 5050 some people say
people some people said that they hated
it some people said that they loved it
and obviously I freaking love it because
it was like the best decision
I'm so happy so this is what it is it's
kind of like highlighting kit I don't
know and I choose the one from for
medium to dark brown hair and this isn't
honey
so it's honey highlighting kit there's
three versions there's this one there's
light brown to blonde and then I think
there's a dark blonde to light blonde or
something like that but there's like
three versions this is the darkest one
so I chose this one and then on the back
it kind of shows how it's gonna look and
my hair was like in the middle Conda and
it kind of turned out lighter than that
I'm so happy
can you see my bobby pins sticking out I
tried wrapping my hair on the point down
I don't know sorry about that okay that
was random um so I use this it was only
seven dollars you can get at Target at
Walgreens CVS you know drugstore places
like that and yeah so overall let me
just write this right now because I like
to write things on my review videos 5
out of 5 or I mean the results okay so
like when you're actually doing it like
the application I'd say that what makes
me happy it probably like two out of
five because I hated doing this but the
result is like ten out of five like oh
my god I'm so happy about this um what's
it called so you guys are probably like
what the heck wait you gave it a 2 out
of 5 for application well that is
because what you do to get highlights
everywhere is basically this box kind of
comes with you know like the hair dyed
bleach all that stuff and then there's
this okay this is how you get it at home
highlights this is like the easiest way
to get at home eyelets because there's
like there's like there's really only
main like two ways to really get
highlights is number one by foiling
which is like just taking piece of hair
covering it wrapping in foil like that's
what Hair Salons usually do I mean
pretty much every single hair salon does
that and obviously it can't do that to
myself because I'm not even like trained
to do hair at all so this is like the
easiest way to do it so this came with
the box yeah and um basically what you
do is to put this on your head and you
part your hair whatever you normally
part it I just parted it down the middle
because I you okay um I mainly have my
hair like down the middle and if
anything else flip my hair back or just
pull it so I don't know I just put it
down the middle and then you put the cap
on and mm-hmm so basically if you see
all these little holes in the cap okay
and there's like different sections
there's like face framing like the crown
the back I did all this all of this and
I'm not even kidding
so there's two looks you can really go
for is either just doing the circle
pulls or doing every single hole in
between do you see that do you see all
those holes like plus the circled ones
and the ones that encircle like those
and stuff I did every single hole in
this cap okay
like that's if you want to achieve like
this kind of like liquor or whatever um
I recommend using every single tool on
this and let me just tell you okay I
started doing my hair at like 1:30 one
o'clock um by the time I finished
washing out my hair
through the whole experience it was
about nine o'clock I'm not even kidding
it took my it honestly wasted my entire
day
I just got text let me go check that
sorry that was my cousin I'll text her
later
okay um so basically what was I talking
about I don't know but I used to every
single hole and basically what they do
is they give you this like plastic like
scoop thing I mean that's like a hook
thing and when you put your hair through
it you like jab it into the hole you
like scoop your hair out and it like
pulls out a strand and then once you've
pulled out all of your strands through
these little holes which let me tell you
like halfway through the process I had
like a complete meltdown because it was
so hard for me just because I had to do
all of this and like especially the
backpack right here was like horrible
because I had
the mirror behind me and I was trying to
do it but then my dad kind of helped me
at this part in the back because I
honestly like at that point I was like
so done with it I've been doing it for
hours and I was like dad help me so
that's the only help that I really got
with was for him to pull out two ones
back here but I pulled it through every
single little thing then once you have
all your strands you mix up your like
mixture thing you like you know saturate
it all leave in a bag and then basically
you have like an hour to kind of like
just guess to me and just kind of like
hope that you're lucky because some hair
can get really light within like ten
minutes and some will have to get all
the way through an hour for me and for
example um what am I saying for example
um some hair actually has goes through
an orange phase where first it strips
the color so your hair looks all orange
and then people make the mistake of just
taking it off right away
because they're freaking out but if your
hair turns orange like really quickly it
starts turning orange leave it in
because right now it's just stripping
the collar then the blonde is actually
gonna like reach like your hair and
that's when the collar starts coming in
so don't take it right out once you see
your hair turning orange like I had a
little orange face but not really I left
my hair and for the whole 1 hour because
it said if your hair if you still like
if you're still going and it reaches to
now or then you should take it out cuz
it's bad for your hair so I had it in
for like 55 minutes because I want to be
safe you know and I freaking love it and
then what you do is you just rinse it
out and you pull off the cap which is
hard because my hair got really naughty
and it was like hard to get it through
these holes again um a bad experience
but um so worth it so so so so worth it
and I washed it out and I'm so happy
with my hair now and I only have two
minutes of battery on this thing Wow um
so couple of you guys like my hair oh
sorry
so what's it called if I recommend you
guys using this okay if you have the
patience for it I just hit myself that's
if you guys have the patience for this
and legit I'm saying you're going to be
sitting in front of mirror for like five
hours if you have that kind of patience
and like commitment to your hair then
definitely try it out it's like not a
fun experience while you're doing it cuz
it takes so long and sometimes you like
for about your hair I'm not trying to
scare you guys
I'm just just like I'm being realistic
here it takes a long time but if you're
willing to go through all that the
result is freakin amazing
like just I don't know you can see like
the highlights everywhere and I love it
and they say that like it blends with
your like natural hair and soft and it
seriously does it really really does I'm
so impressed with this I'm so so so
happy that I got this and yeah my
berries about to die so can't blow you
guys think about this definitely try
this out if you want to go blonde I do
not recommend going blonde right away
but if you want to do at-home
highlighting it's definitely get this
definitely otherwise go to salon because
waiting and doing this for hours is like
it's not cool but if you're if you're
like on a low budget then definitely
this is like seven dollars I was so so
happy I think I'm going to do this next
time again except I'm gonna try foiling
my hair and I'm going to choose like a
lighter one because I really like that
like formula of this but yeah that's
about it I would say more about my
cameras good about to die and I really
don't want to re-record all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
