it what hey guys so today I'm going to
be doing at my first Twitter Q&amp;amp;A video
because normally I answer all of your
questions in my slumber series videos
but those take a little bit more time
and thought to create because I do
different like segments and stuff but
today I decided that I just wanted to
sit down with you guys and answer your
questions via Twitter so I'll just be
answering some of the questions that
used to be hashtag s Claudia and let's
start this shindig let me just grab my
cell phone out of my handy-dandy pocket
you really hope you can't hear the
fridge behind me what's the weirdest
thing you and Aspen have done together
acid I have definitely done some pretty
weird things but to list off one of them
we actually played this game while I was
over at her house in December I don't
know what the game is called but
basically it's made to help you with
talking and making speeches and stuff so
what you do is whoever's going up the
other person has to come up with a
random subject and then the person has
to talk about that subject for as long
as they can without pausing and without
using the words like and um yeah yeah
love you too so I know that it sounds
like a really lame and weird game
because it is I don't even know where I
learned it from but when you really get
into it it actually gets really fun to
keep this story short I ended up having
to talk about penises for six minutes
straight I don't even know if I'm
allowed to say that but I already came
out sorry we ended up having to make
speeches about many many body parts
activities objects yeah I'm just gonna
leave it at that and let your
imagination guess weird
talking about but it it was a really
funny game how does it feel to be
featured in your cities and newspaper
I'm sure most of you don't know about
this because I only tweeted about it but
a few weeks ago I got interviewed by the
splash which is in the Chicago sun-times
so it was a huge deal I got interviewed
with Carly Crispin and Krista Bradford
here on YouTube and it was really cool I
will link the interview down below
because they have an online version but
yeah it was really fun we had a mini
photo shoot and then they interviewed us
and overall it was just a really great
time and it's really exciting so of
course I had my parents by like six
copies and other just sitting in our
house whoo what are you looking forward
to doing this summer well a lot of you
guys don't know this but I'm actually
moving to LA this summer and when I say
move I mean officially move move
full-on Bernie is leaving the nest I'm
actually moving in with another youtuber
as well so you guys can comment down
below and try to guess who I'm going to
be living with I feel like the answer is
very obvious but you can get down there
you're going to beautycon right yes I am
going to New York City beautycon I think
it's happening in like less than two
weeks I've only been to one other New
York Beauty event so I'm very excited to
see a bunch of new faces and meet all of
you guys let me know if any of you guys
are also going to beautycon and if
you're going to meet me I will also be
having a meet-up as well so I'll leave
the details in the down bar for what
time my meetup is gonna be at but I'm
pretty sure it's gonna be at the one of
the booths I'll leave that info down
there will this be in your video here it
is in the video which is a video this
one is also gonna be in the video hey up
there hey
if you would call your hair what color
would it be okay I wanted to put this
question in because I wanted your help
so right now I'm kind of born with my
hair this is pretty much all my natural
hair color except for the bottom I still
have a little bit of ombre left over I
kind of want to dye my hair darker
around the same color as I had I think
around November of last year I'll throw
in a little photo right here but it only
lasted about two weeks because the dye
was it was really crappy it was supposed
to be permanent but it washed out really
fast but yeah I'm thinking of either
going that color again because I really
liked it for the short amount of time
that I had it or I was thinking about
doing two other things the first one
would be dyeing my hair ombre again
because I really like having lighter
hair but I don't really want to do the
whole blonde thing and dealing with
roots and stuff that's just not fun for
me so I either do on breakn or I was
thinking about I bring my hair and then
throwing on like a light violet color so
that I could have like purpley pastel
hair on the bottom obviously that is the
bolder choice but I kind of feel like
hey I'm still at home I'm just a teen
and if I want to dye my hair purple I
feel like I should dye my hair purple
the only thing that's holding me back is
I have senior prom on June 6th and I
really don't want to have the purple
hair I don't know I feel like it
wouldn't match the vibe of my dress so
maybe I will do it sometime next month
I don't know comment down below and let
me know what you guys think about that
do you think purple hair would look good
on me Purple's my favorite color it
always has been and I feel like I should
just put it on my hair I don't know I'm
also kind of nervous because I feel like
it could either look really good or
really really bad how do you know how
you did it after you didn't do it but it
did it well you see when I didn't do it
but thought I did it did itself I didn't
fully do it so I still had to kind of do
it and didn't really know how but then I
did it and it ended up working out what
one word that describes you
I'm dancing to the sound of my
mini-fridge what's the order at Taco
Bell I actually haven't got to talk
about in a very long time I think it's
been like six months or something I
don't know but normally I like to get
the Crunchwrap supreme because it's just
it's soft and then it crunches mmm it's
so good if I don't get that then I
really like the Doritos locos taco
whatever it's called and I like the
ranch flavored one if you're stuck in an
elevator with another youtuber who would
you want to be stuck with I thought
about this question for a good okay Who
am I kidding it took me like 60 seconds
to figure this out but I would
definitely want to be stuck in an
elevator with Kingsley
I think it would just end up being
hilarious he would be ranting about how
we're stuck in an elevator and I would
just I would just really enjoy that I
would enjoy listening to him rant about
this situation we would be in if you're
a guy what name would you want I don't
know what name I would want but my mom
told me that if I was a boy my name
would be Anthony so I would be an
Anthony would you ever come out with
your own clothing line that would be
sold in stores I'm like thinking about
it and that would be a dream come true
honestly I want to put that my bucket
list because that would be the coolest
thing ever so oh gosh I hope maybe one
day in the future who knows audio what
has been your greatest achievement to be
honestly guys I'm really proud of myself
for throwing on makeup and kind of
brushing out my hair and filming this
video for you guys because that was
really lazy today I really like doing it
but then I was like hey live in the
moment do something productive and now
I'm doing something productive and I'm
proud of it obviously until the kidding
but
I don't know honestly like is it kind of
lame to say that I feel like my biggest
achievement would be my youtube channel
I'm really proud of how far I've gone
with it and to where it's going and
stuff so I would have to say my youtube
channel I'm very proud of it and I know
that I've worked hard to get to where
I'm at so that makes it feel better
inside as well should I watch Gossip
Girl I why is this a question baby baby
baby
no no no no first word that comes to
your mind when you read this go cup
why do you slay 24/7 okay if you could
listen to one song for the rest of your
life what would it be this question is
so hard because I get sick of songs so
quickly and easily it would definitely
have to be a slower song though because
I can tolerate those for a longer period
of time I think it would have to be
anything Lana Del Rey honestly like any
song what is your dream house I am NOT
one of those girls who plans out her
entire life and who she's gonna marry
and her kids names and how many kid she
wants and all that stuff but I have
thought about like a dream house keep in
mind this was like in sixth grade during
history class or something when
obviously I wasn't paying attention to
the lesson but yeah I kind of designed
this house in my head and I think it'd
be so cool so let me know if any of you
guys live in this type of house have you
ever seen one for because I would be
extremely jealous so the way that it
would look is the building would be in
like a doughnut shape or like a circle
in the middle of it there would be like
a little courtyard with maybe a fountain
or a garden or something like that and
then I think it would be really cool if
all the kids lived on the you know top
floor second floor or whatever and I
would have a balcony wrap around the
entire thing so everyone can come
outside from their bedrooms walk down
and eat breakfast in the little patio
courtyard thing in the mid
and yeah don't you think that would be
so cool I'm just having like a lot of
flowers outside and stuff and then
everyone like meets in the center that
would be really cool would you go to
first base with me what's your bra size
are you bottom how far have you ever
gone ladies I know you're eager to hear
my answers but you will get them in
person so those are all the questions
that I'll be answering for today's
hashtag as Claudia if you guys enjoyed
this video then it be sure to give it a
thumbs up because that really helps me
out and let me know how often you guys
want me to do these videos because I
think they're really fun I love just
casually sitting with you guys chatting
up a storm so yeah if you want to see
them once a month twice a month more
than twice a month up to you guys
first word that comes to your mind when
you read this go watch convert um if
you're still watching this video
diamond Claudia you slay my socks off
