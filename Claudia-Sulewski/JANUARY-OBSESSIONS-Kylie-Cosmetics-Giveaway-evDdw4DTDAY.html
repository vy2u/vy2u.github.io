phone hey guys welcome back in today's
video I'm going to be showing you all
the things that I've been obsessed with
during month of January my last
favorites video was all the way back in
October so this video is kind of like
three months overdue going into the new
year I started planning out what types
of videos I want to upload and you guys
really seem to love my serious videos
and I love filming them but this year I
wanted to add a little sprinkle a little
dash of something extra I'm going to
kind of give away at least one of my
favorites in every single monthly
favorites video complie not I love all
the stuff that I talk about and so I
want one of you guys to share the love
with me keep on watching to find out
what I will be giving away in today's
video as well as how to enter blah blah
blah let's get into my January favorites
we're going to start off with makeup
favorites I'm going to have all of the
products links down below that is also
something that I'm going to get better
about this year so if you want to check
anything out read about it buy it
whatever it'll be down there I'm
actually going to take care of the
description box now you guys have
actually seen me using my first
favorites in my last tutorial maybe last
two not sure but I have been in love
with these these are the places from
Benefit Cosmetics the way I look at it
is you can pretty much use these for
anything foundation concealer contouring
just depending on what shade you get my
two favorites are spin-the-bottle which
is a shade that is slightly lighter than
my skin tone I love spin-the-bottle for
highlighting underneath my eyes
concealing and a little on my nose
forehead for the complete opposite I
have been using the shade jumprope as my
contour and I am so so obsessed with
this these places are so blendable and
creamy and they just melt right into
your skin so this has kind of been like
my contouring duo lately obsessed my
next era is an eyeshadow palette and I
finally got my hands on the kylie jenner
bronze palette I believe this is the
first one that she came out with I have
been using this eyeshadow palette
non-stop ever since I got it it's so
good
personally I was very excited for the
peachy shade right
Center and I've been really liking it as
a transition color so I'll pop that in
first and then either lighten up the
look dark in whatever this is a really
great all-around day tonight I makeup
palette that's what I realized
it'll be great for traveling and just
creating any type of look when
purchasing this I assumed that it would
be great and that I would love it so I
actually bought you guys a second so
that's what I'm going to be giving away
in today's video let me know how you
guys want me to give these away for this
one I'm going to do an Instagram because
it's so much easier to announce the
winner is the end them all that stuff
all you have to do is head over to my
Instagram like this photo find it on my
feed and call me and that's it I will
just randomly generate one of these
likers from that photo make sure you're
following me and I'll vmu that stuff we
are jumping into skin care products do
you guys know how much I love skin care
products and trying different masks and
all of that fancy stuff
for starters you guys know how much I
love the old Henriksen
truth serum collagen booster this month
I picked up another product from the
same brand and this is the pure truth
you activating oil nourish your hair and
brighten with pure rose hip seed oil
when you pump it out it's a little
intimidating because it's bright orange
and you throw it on your face and your
face will kind of orange but it soaks
right in the color goes away they
actually mix it into either my serum or
my everyday moisturizer you guys already
know these three has been like my
everyday mmm
what is that what does that even mean oh
my neck skin hair favorite is a face
mask and it kind of actually ties into
these two because they kind of remind me
of each other again induce obsessive
putting things in my face that smell
like oranges and are interacting on a
plastic of course this mask is from the
brand fresh I obsessed with so many of
their different face masks and lately
I've been using this one a bunch but
this would be a vitamin nectar vibrancy
boosting
face mask it smells so good I'm really
into face masks that don't harden on
your face I don't like the ones that you
have to like peel off I just feel like
it's so aggressive on your skin so I
really like the soft ones that you just
let sit on your skin for
ten minutes to weather and then you wash
it off I love anything that makes my
skin vibrant and cuz brings out at color
boost and life next up I have two health
&amp;amp; wellness related products back in
October I introduce you guys to the
brand Tom I talked about a few different
supplements I like from them I will
literally go on the site and be like hmm
well do I need to pee yeah PMS beyond
six out okay if you go on their site
they have every single type of different
supplement whether you want something to
strengthen your nails or help you relax
throughout the day or help with your PMS
they have everything oh my god I don't
even know where to begin with this so
this is their raw Beauty green superfood
powder and what it does is it helps
boost energy and radiant skin and
metabolism with raw organic greens and
adopted in and ends on probiotics once
again I'll have links to everything so
you can actually read more into it and
all that stuff it's done' for you guys
this flavor is amazing it's mint
chocolate chip
infusion I'll just mix this in with a
glass of almond milk and I'll do in like
a little that's not a good hand gesture
don't have with me right now what this
blender bottle right here I will throw
some unsweetened almond milk in there
from scoop of this in there shake it up
and it tastes like chocolate milk but
you're actually helping your body and
you feel amazing and it wakes you up
amazing I've also tried their berry
flavor I have that downstairs as well
that led into my smoothies but this one
I love to drink alone because my other
favorites is another powder and it is a
protein powder I never really knew much
about what kind of protein powder to buy
for your body but I found that I really
like plant protein this is probably my
favorite brand I'm just showing you guys
a little single serving packet but it's
by the brand plant fusion nature's most
complete plant protein so I will either
add this into a smoothie or honestly
I'll just add it into the same almond
milk mixture as my hump powder yeah it
tastes amazing this is the original
flavor which doesn't really change
anything I really like the vanilla being
one is my favorite I have one hair
favorites for the month of January it is
a dry texturizing spray
basically I use it in replace of a hair
spray I discovered this product your
just being on set I noticed that a lot
of different hair stylists and makeup
artists we're using this product on my
hair and first of all it smells amazing
it smells so freakin good I just noticed
that it made my hair feel amazing look
amazing and actually lasts long but it's
super light on your hair which is great
my name is sneakers these aren't very
very new and only wore them a few times
so they are brighter than my career
these are the Nike Air Force Ones the
low-cut version I've been wanting me for
so long I don't know why it took me this
long to purchase them I often spend my
days wearing leggings and a hoodie or
sweat pants very casual and so these are
the perfect kind of go-to sneakers that
I can throw on very very happy with
these my second clothing favorite I
don't even know why I'm showing this to
you guys because it's literally a pair
of men's sweatpants basically I started
this tradition where during the holiday
season I like to buy my brother's new
sweatpants and I also purchased the same
pants for myself because some we're
gonna really like men's sweatpants for
the women I've been obsessed with these
they're from the brand adidas first of
all the giant pockets on the side just
give me a very like Backstreet Boys vibe
or something old-school
I don't see a lot of sweatpants with
that anymore in general these are just
so soft on the inside the so warm if you
were to ask any of my roommates of what
I wear every single days of the house
they would save you sweat pants I wear
them every single freaking day when I'm
working at home walking around playing
with the dogs whatever it may be I love
them to finish off the video I might as
well add in that kailani new album came
out yesterday and it wasn't on Spotify
just dance but I think it is now so I'm
actually going to listen to this right
after recording this video I'm assuming
I'm gonna love it so I'm going to throw
it in as my favorite because that is how
much your locate Lonnie but that
