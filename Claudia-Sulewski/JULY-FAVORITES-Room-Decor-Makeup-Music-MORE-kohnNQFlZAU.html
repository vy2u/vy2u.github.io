what
hello everybody welcome back to my
channel today's video is gonna be
significantly better than the last one
because a I'm using natural lighting
instead of lightbulbs and such be I'm
finally using my external mic instead of
just using the microphone on my camera
and see I remembered to turn off the air
conditioning on my ceiling because it
was so loud and annoying my last video
so I am sorry you guys had to sit
through that I almost did not upload it
but I decided you know sometimes the
show must go on but anyways let's get
started with the video so today I'm
gonna be talking about a bunch of things
that I've been loving and I would have
to say that July was such an awesome
month for me oh my goodness
so to quickly recap I moved into a house
with Alexi Jack and Drew and I've been
having so much fun decorating my room
and in general just living with multiple
people is so fun still can't really tell
if it's motivating to live with
youtubers or if it's just very
distracting living with a bunch of
people with always having guests over I
would say it's a combination of both but
it's been a really great experience
secondly VidCon of course happened this
month and it was so awesome meeting a
bunch of you guys I did have my own
little impromptu meetup at the
convention center so hopefully I was
able to meet a lot of you guys I mean I
know that I met a lot of you guys
hopefully I got to meet you if you're
watching this and what else happen this
month yeah yeah those are the two big
things I guess we'll just hop into the
actual physical things so the first
thing that I have been loving this month
is coconut oil and this is the solid
organic virgin coconut oil from Trader
Joe's I have heard so many people talk
about putting Coco Coco yeah Coco Cola
yeah
I heard so many people talk about how
awesome coconut oil is for your skin and
your hair and things of that sort but
I've just been using this on my legs and
arms and I love it it moisturizes the
heck out of your skin and it also makes
it really shiny and smooth looking it's
obviously very good for you and it's
just awesome I also just feel really
crafty using this my next two favorites
are lip products and of course they're
from buxom this shouldn't be a shocker
these are like the only products that I
put on my lips nowadays the first one is
one of their lip foundations and I raved
about these in my last favorites video
but I don't think I talked about this
shade at the time I was loving the nude
color which I still love so much but it
is pretty light so it's not like an
everyday type of lip color this month
I've been using undressed a lot and it's
actually what I'm wearing on my lips
right now so it's definitely still nude
but it's very close to my natural lip
color I just love the finish of these
how long they last on your lips and the
feel and all those things just great
love it definitely get it I've also been
loving a lip gloss which is so weird for
me to say I would say for the past year
I would stay clear from lip glosses
because they would always just get
really clumpy on my lips and it would
look uneven it was just really gross but
I found one that doesn't do any of those
things so this is one of their full-on
lip creams this is in the shade Bellini
which is like a pinky nude color this
lip gloss is so pigmented so smooth and
it actually looks really really good so
if I want like a shiny kind of nude look
then I'll take this product and put this
over and it just looks awesome
I even wear this alone - yeah good eye I
lost my train of thought my next
favorite is for my hair
and I'm really excited about these
because I feel like I've been using the
same shampoo and conditioner for the
past like a year and a half but I
finally switched it up at a very happy
that I did so these are by the brand
L'Oreal and they look like this I got
both matching sets I've got the volume
filler shampoo and conditioner I have a
lot of hair but my hair is very thin and
fine so I decided to get these and I
noticed a difference after the first
time I'm using it I don't know if it was
like the placebo effect and I thought
that I would notice a difference but I
seriously do feel like my hair's been
looking very full and feeling really
thick for the past month so I'm just
gonna blame it on these to blame it's
not the right word that sounds like a
bad thing it's a great thing these are
great
I had an information but not really at
the same time so you guys know that I
love my makeup forever HD foundation but
they recently came out with a updated
line I don't even think they sell the
old ones anymore but these are the ultra
HD foundations and I am so pleased with
this the foundation that I was
previously using it definitely have more
of a pink undertone and I have more of
like a yellow olive undertone to my skin
I decided to pick up a new shade in this
new line and this is the Y 375 shade I
just love it the formula of this I love
the look of it honestly I don't see
myself buying a new foundation any time
soon because I'm so so happy with this
line whew I've got one last beauty
favorites
side note I feel like I have a lot of
beauty favorites this month I feel like
a real beauty guru this is cool so my
last makeup related favorites would have
to be this eyeshadow this is by the
brand buxom which first of all let's
look at the packaging because it is so
cute I'm kind of thinking about putting
it on display in my room because it
totally matches my room but anyways
let's get to the actual product so on
the inside you've got a bunch of neutral
eye shadows
I've been using this every single day
besides today the day I talk about this
palette would be the day I wouldn't use
it but I promise you guys I have been
loving this thing so I've only gotten to
one last fashion favorites there are a
few other things that I was loving but I
included them in my last haul so I
didn't want to be like repetitive and
showed the same hat and the same
sunglasses but pretty much my last haul
was all the clothes that I've been
loving this month but as far as shoes I
do have a favorite pair of shoes for
this month and it would have to be these
bad boys right here oh yeah they are so
intimidating they're from Nasty Gal
specifically the brands Jeffrey Campbell
let me just split them apart the laces
are so long as you can see it has this
really awesome like cutout design it's
made of black leather or suede or
something in between Nets but I love how
there's a little cutout at the heel and
they are just so cute so I've just been
messing around with these I actually
wore them at VidCon with like my new
nasty all grey dress it was a great look
and yeah they're just really comfortable
they're awesome a spice a funny look and
five stars from Claudia my next favorite
is a magazine the reason why this teen
vogue magazine is in this video is
because they find it
BAM
yo girl is in this month's issue of I
just dropped something your girl is in
this month's issue of Teen Vogue
magazine
what Oh a few months ago I finished
shoots with Teen Vogue Maybelline and
two other youtubers Karissa and Ashley
we created a bunch of looks for
back-to-school and they finally came out
when you guys first started tweeting me
pictures of this magazine I was getting
really excited and I was like oh my god
this is so cool but the day that I
actually went to Walgreens and picked up
a physical copy and looked at it I got
so so happy because this is crazy I
cannot believe that I have an entire
page to myself in a Teen Vogue magazine
one of my favorite magazines I just
remember feeling on top of the world
that day and it's still so awesome to
look at this and think yep this is this
is little Claudia this stuff would not
be happening without you guys and
without this channel and it is so
surreal and I am just so so thankful for
all the opportunities I get
oh my goodness I literally want to go
out and like buy a frame and frame this
on my wall is that is that weird or is
that like a proud thing to do I would
say I'm proud I I'm gonna do it also if
you go to any type of drugstore whether
it may be Target or Walgreens or
something and you actually go to the
makeup aisle you will see my face on one
of the little makeup stand things I
actually haven't seen it in real life
yet I've only seen people tweeting me
pictures but if you actually go to the
makeup aisle you will see my face again
which is crazy I cannot wait to see it
moving on to
music my mom is calling me hello hello
hello she bought that with me she bought
- me if you guys ever want to know what
my mom's but so I was like okay oh my
god she's calling me again she's trying
to get that self promo anyways back to
music so earlier this month I bought
myself a record player and it is awesome
I got it off of Amazon for about hundred
dollars which is not too bad and it's by
the brands audio technica which I've
heard is really good all the reviews
that I read were really positive there
are a few record album vinyl
thingamajigger areas a lot of the terms
that I've been loving I formed quite a
collection over the past few weeks it's
a little sad I wanted to rave about a
few real quick so the first one is of
course imagine dragons this is an old
album but for some reason it always puts
me in the best mood and this is great
music if you're just cleaning your room
or if you're just doing some sort of
work or maybe you're getting ready also
if you guys have watched me for a little
while then you would know that I used to
grow up listening to Moby and Coldplay
throughout the house cuz we had speakers
and so I decided to pick up Coldplay
viva la vida
and yeah this just gives a really homey
kind of vibe for me so I definitely like
to play this whatever I'm just kind of
chilling in my room
I would never consider myself like an
ariana grande fan but I've just been
obsessed with this album her voice is so
good and her videos not her videos I'm
in YouTube mode her music is really
chill and it's really nice to listen to
I feel like every single album so far
has been well it's really nice to chill
or get ready to but that's literally
what I was about to say I don't know I
just like it okay and then the last one
that I want to bring up was The Great
Gatsby soundtrack love it and my last
favorite is my chair swing your chair
type thing I don't know I got it from
mod shop it's really nice it's white and
black and it's kind of bouncy wittily
fell asleep and took a nap on it
yesterday if that doesn't show how much
I love this thing I don't know what done
is but I pretty much eat my breakfast
out here I do work out here all that fun
stuff so
honestly if this footage comes out good
I might actually film a video out here
because this is cute I dig this a lot
okay back to my room so that is it for
all the things that I have been loving
during the month of July I hope you guys
enjoyed it be sure to comment down below
what you've been loving this past month

it I'll see you guys next week bye next
