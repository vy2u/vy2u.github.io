in today's video I'm going to be talking
about my obsessions of jun 2015 before I
get into my beauty favorites I quickly
want to give a shout out to another one
of my obsessions because this one
definitely is my biggest obsession I
feel like I'm going to be using the word
obsession a lot in today's video we'll
see i'll try to keep it to a minimum but
it would have to be the passion planner
and i am not sponsored by the passion
plan or anything like that i bought this
myself i kid you not guys this planner
was made for me i decided to get the
smaller size because it's a lot more
portable let me just show you guys how
crazy i get with it i'm going to keep it
behind me so you guys can actually read
everything but i love using highlighters
to kind of organize everything and i
basically just kind of go nuts with it
it's great it actually makes me stay on
task and the best part is i'll usually
give myself a little bit more time for
everything so that i know that i'll be
finishing it on time and when you're
like ahead of schedule it makes you feel
even more motivated because you're like
yeah I'm ahead of schedule and I have
time to do this in this now so I just
fricking love this thing so my first
makeup obsession would actually be a
collection from benefit and these babies
right here are the reason why I recently
went to the Bahamas so for starters they
launched a bunch of different colors of
the push-up liner which I've always been
a fan of the black one I have maybe like
three in my bathroom right now but they
came out with four new colors there's a
brown for a more natural look you've got
green blue and purple overall I really
really like how the green looks on my
eyes because my eyes are also green and
for some reason it helps to kind of make
them pop and make them look even more
green along with that they launched a
new they're real mascara but this one is
like
electric blue color which is so awesome
because I've never put any color on my
lashes before it just makes them pop and
like nobody would ever expect you to
have blue eyelashes my next favorite is
a lip product and this is by brand buxom
I have been all about their with
products lately this is one of their
true nude lip foundations this product
is so freaking good the way that it
feels on your lips it has like a velvety
touch to it and it is really really
pigmented so you could literally just
tap it on your lips and have an entire
full covered blip look my next favorite
is actually a combo of two different
makeup products this is the lipstick in
cinnamon it's like a dark brown lipstick
I've definitely talked about this before
but I love applying this on to my lips
in combination with this blush I've
actually had this for at least two years
and I've always gone like back and forth
with it but I am so obsessed with it
right now it looks so good especially
with the brown lip so if you guys want
to see kind of like an example of how
look together I am wearing this combo in
my Twitter picture right here I get
questions all the time on how I did my
makeup for this picture right here but
that is the cheek and lip that I'm
wearing and I am obsessed with it but
next favorite is a facial cleanser and
I'm really excited to talk about this
because for the past year i would say
i've been using the clean and clear like
acne advanced something cleanser which i
really like but i hate the fact that
there's lots of chemicals and acids in
it to help clear skin because lately my
skin has been treating me very well i
haven't had any breakouts so knock on
wood I have no
I'm probably a break out next week but
lately i have not had any issues with
acne so i decided to purchase something
a little bit more natural and probably
better for my skin overall so i decided
to pick up the Burt's Bees intense
hydration cream cleanser the second you
wash it off you feel like you've already
moisturize your face so sometimes I
don't even put lotion on because I get
kind of lazy and it's just great it
smells so good it just has a very kind
of flowering but citrusy fresh smell
very very pleased yes good job my next
favorite is a body product and this is
the soap &amp;amp; Glory flake away skin scrub I
think that's what it's called this stuff
has got shea butter sugar and peach seed
powder inside of it which helps to
exfoliate and rub off all of the dead
skin cells on your body and this is by
far like the best body scrub I've ever
tried and I'm obsessed with it every few
days I like to use this and just
exfoliate my entire body shape our lives
and then that is when I put self tanner
on so I also really love putting this on
before self tanner because it helps to
take off all that dead skin so you've
got a new fresh coat to put your self
tanner on and it smells amazing and the
packaging is adorable and i highly
recommend it so my next few favorites
are more miscellaneous and i actually
wrote them down in my potion planner so
let's just check out this list next one
is a song and why did i forget the title
of it but it's the new weekend song I
think it's called I can't feel my face I
believe that's what it is but it is such
a catchy song i love my choice of it it
is so good i believe more songs down
below that i've been loving because my
internet is not working right now so i
can't go through my spotify and look at
different songs so i'll just have all
this down there and i'll link them for
you guys my next favorite would have to
be acai bowls or i guess for me
smoothi-- bowls maybe i've been posting
lot of pictures of these little smoothie
bowls with a bunch of cute toppings on
them and basically they're like a really
big trend right now but I actually love
making them at home because they're so
filling they're so delicious and they
are so healthy for you so next week's
video I'm actually going to show you
guys how I create mine it's really not
hard at all I show you guys what
toppings I use what I've inside of them
but basically I've been eating them
every single day every single morning
like I kid you not I always have frozen
fruit and driving through packets and
all that stuff in my kitchen also I've
really got into snapchat this month if
you guys want to follow me on snapchat
you can just scan over this little icon
right here it's actually really cool all
you do is scan over it and it
immediately like adds the person as a
friend I don't know I'm really
fascinated with it would you want to go
me on snapchat you can just hover your
snapchat camera over this thing right
here but lately I've just been getting
really into it i really love drawing and
doing cool doodles and everything and
are you guys going to be impressed with
it I like drawing it's fun but so that
is it for all the things that I've been
loving this month but before I end up
today's video I quickly want to update
you guys a little bit share a little
announcement an announcement I don't
really know I mean I'm excited basically
I just wanted to let you guys know that
I'm actually moving next week which is
crazy I kind of mentioned it on Twitter
and some people were like audio why are
you moving like you just moved a year
ago when you're renting apartments your
lease is only 12 months long and then
you get to choose if you want to live
there longer but Lexi and I decided that
we wanted to switch places because we
love the area that we're in right now
but we definitely want to go somewhere
that's a little more residential and not
it's crazy because right now we're
living like in the heart of LA so we're
actually moving and things will be very
different there might be some more
people involved so I'm not going to
spill anything yet but I'm very very
excited for the next couple of weeks and
I wanted to let you guys know that I'm
going to be vlogging my entire moving
process because I did that when I first
moved out here and you guys were
obsessed with the vlogs so of course I
want to do that again so if you guys
want to follow my second channel it's
just young movie star TV it's always
linked down over there so you can click
to subscribe but I will be vlogging
every single day during the moving
process if not like every other day oh
yeah I'm super excited for the
summertime and the big move and
everything and I'm very sudden just to
give back into videos I've already pre
filmed next week and the week after this
video just awesome because I can
