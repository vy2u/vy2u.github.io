in today's video I'm going to be talking
about my obsessions of June 2015 before
I get into my beauty favorites I quickly
want to give a shout out to another one
of my obsessions because this one
definitely is my biggest obsession I
feel like I'm gonna be using the word
obsession a lot in today's video we'll
see I'll try to keep it to a minimum but
it would have to be the passion planner
and I am not sponsored by the passion
plan or anything like that I bought this
myself
I kid you not guys this planner was made
for me I decided to get the smaller size
because it's a lot more portable let me
just show you guys how crazy I get with
it I'm gonna keep it behind me so you
guys can actually read everything but I
love using highlighters to kind of
organize everything and I basically just
kind of go nuts with it it's great it
actually makes me stay on task and the
best part is I'll usually give myself a
little bit more time for everything so
that I know that I'll be finishing it on
time and when you're like ahead of
schedule it makes you feel even more
motivated because you're like yeah I'm
ahead of schedule and I have time to do
this and this now so I just freaking
love this thing so my first makeup
obsession would actually be a collection
from benefit and these babies right here
are the reason why I recently went to
the Bahamas so for starters they
launched a bunch of different colors of
the push-up liner which I've always been
a fan of the black one I have maybe like
three in my bathroom right now but they
came out with four new colors there's a
brown for a more natural look you've got
green blue and purple overall I really
really like how the green looks on my
eyes because my eyes are also green and
for some reason it helps to kind of make
them pop and make them look even more
green along with that they launched a
new they're real mascara but this one is
like
electric blue color which is so awesome
because I've never put any color on my
lashes before it just makes them pop and
like nobody would ever expect you to
have blue eyelashes my next favorite is
a lip product and this is by brand buxom
I have been all about them with products
lately this is one of their true nude
lip foundations this product is so
freakin good the way that it feels on
your lips it has like a velvety touch to
it and it is really really pigmented so
you could literally just tap it on your
lips and have an entire full covered lip
look my next favorite is actually a
combo of two different makeup products
this is the lipstick in cinnamon it's
like a dark brown lipstick I've
definitely talked about this before but
I love applying this onto my lips in
combination with this blush I've
actually had this for at least two years
and I've always gone like back and forth
with it but I am so obsessed with it
right now it looks so good especially
with a brown lip so if you guys want to
see kind of like an example of how look
together I am wearing this combo in my
Twitter picture right here I get
questions all the time on how I did my
makeup for this picture right here but
that is the cheek and lip that I'm
wearing
I my next favorite is a facial cleanser
and I'm really excited to talk about
this because for the past year I would
say I've been using the clean and clear
like acne advanced something cleanser
which I really like but I hate the fact
that there's lots of chemicals and acids
in it to help clear skin because lately
my skin has been treating me very well I
haven't had any breakouts so knock on
wood I have no one around me I'm
probably gonna break out next week but
lately I have not had any issues with
acne so I decided to purchase something
a little bit more natural and probably
better for my skin overall so I decided
to pick up the Burt's Bees intense
hydration cream cleanser the second you
wash it off you feel like you've already
moisturized your face so sometimes I
don't even put lotion on because I get
kind of lazy and it's just great it
smells so good it just has a very kind
of flowering but citrusy fresh smell
very very pleased yes good job my night
server it is a body product and this is
the soap &amp;amp; Glory flake away spin scrub I
think that's what it's called this stuff
has got shea butter sugar and peach seed
powder inside of it which helps to
exfoliate and rub off all of the dead
skin cells on your body and this is by
far like the best body scrub I've ever
tried and I'm obsessed with it every few
days I like to use this and just
exfoliate my entire body shape our lives
and then that is when I put self tanner
on so I also really love bring this on
before self-tanner because it helps to
take off all that dead skin so you've
got a new fresh coat to put your self
tanner on and it smells amazing and the
packaging is adorable and I highly
recommend it so my next few favorites
are more miscellaneous and actually it
wrote them down in my fashion planner so
let's just check out this list the next
one is a song and why did I forget the
title of it
it's the new weekend song I think it's
called I can't feel my face
I believe that's what it is but it is
such a catchy song I love the Kois of it
it is so good I believe more songs down
below that I've been loving because my
internet is not working right now so I
can't go through my Spotify and look at
different songs so I'll just have all
this down there and I'll link them for
you guys my next favorite would have to
be acai bowls or I guess for me smoothie
bowls lately I've been posting a lot of
pictures of these little smoothie bowls
with a bunch of cute toppings on them
and basically they're like a really big
trend right now but I actually love
making them at home because they are so
filling they're so delicious and they
are so healthy for you so next week's
video I'm actually going to show you
guys how I create mine it's really not
hard at all I'll show you guys what
toppings I used what I put inside of
them but basically I've been eating them
every single day every single morning
like I kid you not I always have frozen
fruit and driving through packets and
all that stuff in my kitchen also I
really got into snapchat this month if
you guys want to follow me on snapchat
you can just scan over this little icon
right here it's actually really cool all
you do is scan over it and it
immediately like adds the person as
friend I don't know I'm really
fascinated with it if you want to go me
on snapchat you can just hover your
snapchat camera over this thing right
here but lately I've just been getting
really into it I really love drawing and
doing cool doodles and everything and I
know you guys seem to be impressed with
it I like drawing it's fun its immense
it for all the things that I've been
loving this month but before I am up
today's video I quickly want to update
you guys a little bit share a little
announcement an announcement I don't
really know I mean I'm excited basically
I just wanted to let you guys know
that I'm actually moving next week which
is crazy I kind of mentioned it on
Twitter and some people were like
Claudio why are you moving like you just
moved a year ago when you're renting
apartments your lease is only 12 months
long and then you get to choose if you
want to live there longer but it's Lexi
and I decided that we wanted to switch
places because we love the area that
we're in right now but we definitely
want to go somewhere that's a little
more residential and that's crazy
because right now we're living like in
the heart of an LA so we're actually
moving and things will be very different
there might be some more people involved
so I'm not gonna spill anything yet
but I'm very very excited for the next
couple of weeks and I wanted to let you
guys know that I'm going to be vlogging
my entire moving process because I did
that when I first moved out here and you
guys were obsessed with the vlogs so of
course I want to do that again so if you
guys want to follow my second channel
it's just young Beauty start TV it's
always linked down over there so you can
click to subscribe
but I'll be vlogging every single day
during the moving process if not like
every other day but yeah I am super
excited for the summertime and the big
move and everything and I'm very excited
just to get back into videos I've
already pre filmed at next week's and
the week after this video it's just
awesome because I can actually move and
vlog and do all that stuff so yeah I
just wanted to update you guys a little
bit I've got like three more days until
