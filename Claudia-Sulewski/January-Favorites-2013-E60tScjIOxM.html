so today I'm going to be doing my
January favorites of 2013 so starting
out with my first fashion favorite it
would definitely have to be these shoes
right here and I don't even think I've
talked about them on youtube yet but
yeah I got these in the beginning of
January and these wedges are from go
Jane calm they're pretty expensive but I
got them on sale and I have been wearing
these so often which is actually kind of
crazy because I literally wear my black
combat boots every single day but in a
way I kind of feel like these look like
combat boots except in a wedge form so
they already matched so much to a lot of
my outfits so I've been getting some
great use on these actually wore them
today with my outfit I'm just wearing my
Miley Cyrus shirt if you guys saw my
haul then you would know why I'm calling
it my Miley Cyrus shirt and then I'm
just wearing high-waisted jeans shorts
from forever and then I'm wearing tights
from American Apparel
so that was my outfit and I freaking
love these so much and they are very
very comfortable so these are by far my
number one favorite this entire month my
next fashion favorite is this
acid-washed button-up shirt I also have
not shown this on YouTube yes but a
while ago I mean my first purchase off
toe be calm and when you make your first
purchase then you get 50% off so I kind
of went ham I literally bought $400
worth of stuff but I saved $200 which
was awesome so this was one of the
pieces that I got it's just a super long
button-up acid-wash light shirt and I
love it because I brought this to Hawaii
with me and I wore it as like a cover-up
but I also just love wearing this as
like a cardigan sweater type of thing to
put over a bunch of different outfits I
just roll up the sleeves like 3/4 of the
way down my arm and I have it in the
size medium which I think they messed up
but I actually really like how it's kind
of oversized so I didn't really bother
to return it or anything so I've been
loving that shirt I wear it like at
least once a week this month I had three
Beauty favorites and the first one is
the Urban Decay Naked 2 palette I
finally got it I know it is taking me so
long I don't know why but I got this for
my cousin earlier this month and I've
been using it so often I love the colors
I think they're all very beautiful and
then also I recently tried the
Maybelline mega plush volume express
mascara and I don't love it it's not my
favorite mascara but it definitely is a
very good one the wand is just kind of
like a straight across wand but I
definitely recommend putting on two
coats if you have or want to buy this
mascara because one coat only gives me
like lengths but then I feel like when I
find two coats then it gives me a volume
so two coats of this is really nice and
then my last favorite which I have been
using this little like every single day
I'm not even kidding
it is the Revlon lip butter in
creamsicle this product has literally
taken the place of all of my chap sticks
and lipsticks and lip glosses like I
have been using this every single day it
is perfect for the school week just
because it's so easy to apply on and
it's very moisturizing but it also gives
you a little bit of color and you guys
know how I am with my light lips so yeah
I love this when my lips aren't chapped
incorrectly then I'll just apply it you
know like you normally would and it
gives a really nice kind of light flush
to your lips now if you want to use this
lip butter with chapped lips then I
definitely recommend like dabbing it on
your lips instead of swiping it across
because otherwise the products get stuck
in between all the cracks and it just
doesn't look cute so just kind of dip it
on like that and I'm wearing it right
now and I just love this my favorite
perfume of the month has got to be at my
Daisy Marc Jacobs perfume I got this for
Christmas and it is just so different
compared to all my other perfumes that I
own I just feel like it smells so sweet
but much sure and it is definitely
really flowery and usually
for more like sugary sense I have one
hair product and it is the bumble and
bumble surf spray and I love spraying
this in my hair if I want to achieve
like a messy beachy look
and I actually got this and like the
beginning of summer but I didn't really
use it that often because my hair was so
long that like whenever I wanted to
create kind of like this look that I
have right now my hair would just fall
flat in like 20 minutes but now that my
hair is short I feel like it kind of
keeps that scrunched messy look so what
I'll do is I'll just go to bed with a
bun in my hair and then I'll just take
it out and my hair will look somewhat
like this usually a little bit more
curls because I just came back from
school I just hang out of the bun and I
spray it all over I basically just go
like that I just sprayed my face and
then I just kind of scrunch it in like
that I got some in my mouth too but
that's all I do you can see it just
gives that look like as if you just came
out of the ocean and yeah I love this
stuff now let's get on to my nan beauty
fashion hair related favourites
my first sorta has to be my planner
right here and I got this maybe like
three weeks ago or something I don't
really know but I had to buy some new
notebooks for school and I saw this at
Target and I don't know it just it spoke
to me when I saw it it's black it's very
simple nothing special but I just
thought it was so cute how it said 2013
on the front and silver and I basically
been using this just for YouTube it's
kind of like my little youtube planner
um hi kitty
sorry I can't just came in but yeah I've
just been using this for my youtube
schedule and I love it because I kind of
plan out you know what I want to film
edit upload whatever and it's just been
great it's very cute too the colors are
like blue green yellow and I just have
like little note tabs and stuff and this
is
really nice just stay organized I think
it's a smart idea it's nice keeps you
organized so that has been a favorite of
mine also my camera of course I got it
this month it is amazing quality it is
the best camera that I've ever owned and
I just couldn't ask for more so I've
been loving that and staying on with the
camera topic I've also been loving a
certain lens because I got two lenses
when I got the camera so right now I'm
just using the normal one and I also
have this one right here which is the 55
to 250 millimeter so this baby zooms up
so much it gets really big but um I used
it for the intro of my most recent DIY
video about the jewelry so if you want
to see how that turned out but this lens
takes amazing video footage and photos
because it zooms in so well and makes
the picture literally perfect
so what next oh my iPad that's kind of
like a given where is it it's charging I
haven't have to show you guys - it is
called smoothies whole living I think
it's my Martha Stewart but I got a
blender this month finally I got my own
blender because I've been asking like
for so long because ours cracked but I
alright seriously okay so I've been
making smoothies literally every single
day if you follow me on Twitter then
you're probably already annoyed with all
my smoothie tweets but this thing is
awesome
because it gives you so many recipes for
essential smoothies meal and a glass
smoothies allergen free smoothies weight
loss movies immune boosting detox like
endless literally awesome I've been
making a bunch of these smoothies the
directions are so easy and I already own
so many of the ingredients that you can
use and these are super healthy you may
have health stats about everything how
many calories if you're like interest in
doing calorie counting and yeah it's
just really cool and I love it so much
so actually my brother has been loving
this app too he'll like take my iPad and
be like all right let's see what
smoothie we should
today every now and then I'll include
some smoothie recipes during my summer
series episodes just if you guys are
interested in that I don't really know
but yeah I've been loving that's also my
favorite show recently has been the
Carrie Diaries I'm sure you guys have
all heard of it because it was the ad
for all the YouTube videos for the
longest time but there are only three
episodes out right now I think yes it
airs every um Monday on the CW and it is
so good you can watch all the episodes
online and it's I can already tell it's
gonna be one of my favorite shows so I
think that is it for all my favorites
yes it is Oh in my hair duh umm yeah so
obviously I cut my hair this month and
I've been obsessed with it a lot of you
guys don't like it it just makes me
happy and that sounds really weird but I
just smile every time I see it in the
mirror because I love it so much but
that is it for today's video I hope you
guys enjoyed it and yeah comment below
tell me what your favorites of January
are I will see you guys in a new video
