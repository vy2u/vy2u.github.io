same feather something wrong with this
place I got time hi everyone so today
I'm going to be doing my January
favorites of 2013 so starting out with
my first fashion favorite it would
definitely have to be these shoes right
here and I don't even think I've talked
about them on youtube yet but yeah I got
these in the beginning of January and
these wedges are from gojane.com they're
pretty expensive but I got them on sale
and I have been wearing these so often
which is actually kind of crazy because
I literally wear my black combat boots
every single day but in a way I kind of
feel like these look like combat boots
except in a wedge form so they already
matched so much to a lot of my outfits
so I've been getting some great use of
these actually wore them today with my
outfit I'm just wearing my Miley Cyrus
shirt if you guys saw my whole then you
would know why I'm calling it by Miley
Cyrus shirt and then I'm just wearing
high waisted jean shorts from forever
and then I'm wearing tights from
american apparel so that was my outfit
and I freaking love these so much and
they are very very comfortable so these
are by far my number one favor at this
entire month my next fashion favorite is
this acid wash button up shirt i also
have not shown this on youtube yet but a
while ago I mean my first purchase off
Toby calm and when you make your first
purchase then you get fifty percent off
so I kind of let him I literally bought
four hundred dollars worth of stuff but
I saved two hundred dollars which was
awesome so this was one of the pieces
that I got it's just a super long
button-up acid wash light shirt and I
love it because I brought this to Hawaii
with me and I wore it as like a cover-up
but i also just love wearing this as
like a cardigan sweater type of thing to
put over a bunch of different outfits I
just roll up the sleeves like three
fourths of the way down my arm and I
have it in the size medium which I think
they messed up on
but I actually really like how its kind
of oversized so I didn't really bother
to return it or anything so I've been
loving that shirt I wear it's like at
least once a week this month I had three
beauty favorites and the first one is
the Urban Decay Naked 2 palette I
finally got it I know it is taking me so
long i don't know why but i got this for
my cousin earlier this month and i've
been using it so often i love the colors
i think they're all very beautiful and
then also i recently tried the
Maybelline and mega plush volume Express
mascara and I don't love it it's not my
favorite mascara but it definitely is a
very good one the wand is just kind of
like a straight-across wand but i
definitely recommend putting on two
coats if you have or want to buy this
mascara because one coat only gives me
like length but then i feel like when i
find two coats then it gives me a volume
so two coats of this is really nice and
then my last favorite which i have been
using this little like every single day
i'm not even kidding it is the Revlon
lip butter in creamsicle this product
has literally taken the place of all of
my chap sticks and lipsticks and lip
glosses like I have been using this
every single day it is perfect for the
school week just because it's so easy to
apply on and it's very moisturizing but
it also gives you a little bit of color
and you guys know how I am with my light
lips so yeah I love this when my lips
aren't chapped incorrectly then I'll
just apply it you know like you normally
would and it gives a really nice kind of
light flush to your lips now if you want
to use this lip butter with chapped lips
then I definitely recommend like dabbing
it on your lips instead of swiping it
across because otherwise the products
gets stuck in between all the cracks and
it just doesn't look cute so just kind
of dip it on like that and I'm wearing
it right now and I just love this my
favorite perfume of the month has got to
be at my Daisy Marc Jacobs perfume I got
this for Christmas and it is just so
different compared to all my other
perfumes that I own I just feel like it
smells so sweet but much sure and it is
definitely really flowery and usually I
go
for more like sugary sense I have one
hair product and it is the bumble and
bumble surf spray and I love spraying
this in my hair if I want to achieve
like a messy beachy look and I actually
got this in like the beginning of summer
but I didn't really use it that often
because my hair was so long that like
whenever I wanted to create kind of like
this look that I have right now my hair
would just fall flat in like 20 minutes
but now that my hair is short I feel
like it kind of keeps that scrunched
messy look so what I'll do is I'll just
go to bed with a bun in my hair and then
I'll just take it out my hair will look
somewhat like this usually a little bit
more curls because I just came back from
school I just take it out of the bond
and I spray it all over I basically just
go like that I just sprayed my face and
then I just kind of scrunch it in like
that I got spare my mouth too but that's
all I do you can see it just gives that
look like as if you just came out of the
ocean and um yeah I love this stuff now
let's get onto mine on beauty fashion
hair-related favorites my first sorta
had to be my planner right here and I
got this maybe like three weeks ago or
something I don't really know but I had
to buy some new notebooks for school and
I saw this at target and I don't know it
just it spoke to me when I saw it it's
black it's very simple nothing special
but I just thought it was so cute how it
said 2013 on the front and silver and I
basically been using this just for
YouTube it's kind of like my little
YouTube planner um hi kitty I'm sorry
I'm filming the video sorry I can't just
came in but yeah I've just been using
this for my youtube schedule and I love
it because I kind of plan out you know
what I want to film edit upload whatever
and it's just been great it's very cute
too the colors are like blue green
yellow and I just have like little note
tabs and stuff and this is
really nice just stay organized I think
it's a smart idea it's nice keeps you
organized so that has been a favorite of
mine also my camera of course I got it
this month it is amazing quality it is
the best camera that I've ever owned and
I just couldn't ask for more so I've
been loving that and staying on with the
camera topic i've also been loving a
certain lens because i got two lenses
when I got the camera so right now I'm
just using the normal one and I also
have this one right here which is the 55
to 250 millimeter so this baby zooms up
so much it gets really big but um I used
it for the intro of my most recent DIY
video about the jewelry um so if you
want to see how that turned out but this
lens takes amazing video footage and
photos because it zooms in so well it
makes the picture literally perfect so
what next oh my i pad that's kind of
like a given where is it it's charging i
haven't apt to show you guys to is
called smoothies whole living I think
it's my Martha Stewart but I got a
blender this month finally I got my own
blender because I've been asking what
for so long because ours correct but I
all right seriously ok so I've been
making smoothies literally every single
day if you follow me on Twitter then
you're probably already annoyed with all
my smoothie tweets but this thing is
awesome because it gives you so many
recipes for essential smoothies meal and
a glass smoothies allergic free
smoothies weight loss movies immune
boosting detox like endless literally
awesome I've been making a bunch of
these smoothies the directions are so
easy and i already own so many of the
ingredients that you can use and these
are super healthy they have health stats
about everything how many calories if
you're like interest in doing calorie
counting um and yeah it's just really
cool and I love it so much so actually
my brother has been loving this app to
you like take my iPad be like all right
let's see what smoothie we should make
today every now and then i'll include
some smoothie recipes during my summer
series episodes I'm just if you guys are
interested in it I don't really know but
yeah I've been loving that also my
favorite show recently has been the
Carrie Diaries I'm sure you guys have
all heard of it because it was the ad
for all the youtube videos for the
longest time but there are only three
episodes out right now I think yes it
airs every um monday on the CW and it is
so good you can watch all the episodes
online and it's I can already tell it's
gonna be one of my favorite shows so I
think that is it for all my favorites
yes it is Oh in my hair duh um yeah so
obviously i cut my hair this month and
I've been obsessed with it a lot of you
