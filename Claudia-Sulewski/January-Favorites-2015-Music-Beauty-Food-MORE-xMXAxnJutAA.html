and today's video is going to be my
January favorites I don't know why I'm
so excited to film this I just love
talking to you guys on a super casual
level about things that I've been loving
that's good story
my first would have to be these glasses
so I got these in New York when I was at
playlist live tri-states they're from a
wild fox and I've always wanted wild Fox
sunglasses because they're really good
quality they just fit really well on my
face and I've known that because a lot
of my friends on them so this is what
they look like I usually wear my hair up
in a ponytail when I'm wearing them
because it like frames my face having
these on in my hair back I don't really
know but they're just super comfortable
and I frickin love them my next favorite
is a fashion website and I'm sure I told
you guys I've heard about them before
but babe recently hit me up and we're
like Claudia hey if we send you a few
pieces would you be interested in you
know trying them out telling us your
opinion and stuff and I think the
overall concept is just awesome so my
second favorite is Ola TOCOM so start
off by showing you guys the pieces that
I got from there so first off I got this
black dress it's got a high neckline
which is my favorite style for dresses
be bought up is my favorite part because
it has like this little slit right here
and I just really like the points I also
have this t-shirt dress which you guys
might recognize from my holiday lookbook
it has kind of like a black pattern to
it it's super subtle so you guys might
not be able to see it on camera but it's
got two little zipper pockets and they
are actual pockets I had no idea so they
are not just there for appearance can
actually store things in here like food
your cell phone they also have jewelry
so I got this little silver bangle which
actually is
right now because it matches my outfit
super simple you can wear it with a
bunch of things and then also these
little branch earrings I think they're
so cute
the enemies are perfect for the
wintertime and I just really like how
they're silver so now I'm going to get
into more detail about the website and
kind of how it works
Soula TOCOM is kind of like a
subscription website so you signup they
call their packages totes so every totes
that you receive will have three
clothing items and two accessories so
when you sign up you creates a size
profile and then basically you just go
through the pieces and click on the
heart on anything that you like and that
will be thrown into your closet and the
catch about this is that every single
time that you receive clothes and you're
done wearing them you send them back and
get more so you can kind of think of it
as like Netflix for clothes you can wear
the pieces for as long as you want
whether it's two days or three weeks
once you're done right now you send
everything back in the prepaid envelope
that they already give you which is
awesome so you don't have to pay for
shipping but if there's something that
you really love and you want to keep
then all you have to do is just keep it
and return everything else and they will
just charge the card that's already on
file so what I think they're doing is
super cool and I completely support them
so I'll have all their stuff linked down
below they also have a youtube channel
with fashion videos and more info and
stuff so you guys can just check that
stuff out but moving on with my last
fashion favorite of the month it would
have to be a bathing suit what Claudia
it's January where are you talking about
summer things it's just so freakin cute
I want to talk about it I recently got
this bathing suit from triangle which by
the way triangle bathing suits are my
all-time favorite bathing suits I
literally think I have with six of them
sitting in my closet the colors are just
super like well BAM and they're super
comfortable I'm gonna have the color and
style of this one right here because I
don't know at the top of my head but
it's one of the newer ones and I just
love how neon it is and I'm just
freaking love this bathing suit and
lately the weather has been a beautiful
out here in LA so I've started tanning
again with Jack and Drew and it's just a
really great time
also Lexi well LexA goes to yoga a lot
so she hadn't fails out now on Jamaica
my first makeup favorites of January
would have to be the Tarte Amazonian
clay full coverage airbrush foundation I
have heard and seen so many beauty gurus
talking about this product and I finally
decided to go out and get it myself so I
got the shade fair light in neutral
because I was getting a little bit paler
since you know it's not really summer or
anything I'm working on the tan at the
moment undies I'm not shooting or taking
photos I would wear this on its own and
it gives me the perfect amount of
coverage where it's super light and
natural but it also covers everything up
so I really like this powder and I can
definitely see myself getting it again
my next favorite is the Urban Decay
Naked basics 2 palette I've actually had
this for a while but I've never really
talked about it before I start talking
about this I quickly want to rant slash
ask you guys a question
did any of you guys find it super easy
to crack and break the eyeshadows in
these palettes because when I got the
first palette I'm adopted and black eye
shadow one everywhere literally two days
after getting this palette I very
lightly dropped it it was probably like
half a foot drop and an entire eye
shadow cracked out primal also started
to chip so I'm really upset about that
but not too upset to go out and like buy
entire new palettes so besides the last
I shall
I really really love the eye shadows in
this one I would probably have to say
this one is my favorite out of the two I
just really like the Toby Browns in it
it's perfect for in the crease and
everyday eyelets these pallets are just
super small they're perfect from the go
and traveling and I always recommend
them to people so they're just really
great pallets for kind of beginners or
people that just want more neutral looks
literally use these every single day I
love them so much
Mac Sarat is a hair product and it is
the lush no drought - dry shampoo and
I've actually had this before getting
this smaller one I had like the larger
sized one but recently I was talking to
Maddie because she got it back during
the winter time kind of around playlists
and she was raving about it talking
about how it's her favorite jar shampoo
at the moment and she completely reminds
me how much I used to love this stuff so
I actually went out and bought this over
Christmas break because it's really
freakin good and this stuff lasts for
ever I'm telling you I use this so many
times and it still looks like I just
bought it now it is time for brands and
favorite / my favorite category because
I like talking about random things the
first one would have to be my new of the
log in camera you guys know that I
participated in a vlog missed last year
and my camera that I was using before
just stopped working so I decided to
invest in a better one and I am
completely obsessed with this vlogging
camera this is the canon g7x my favorite
feature about it would definitely have
to be the flip up screen because you can
see yourself upon the vlogging which is
super awesome because if you have you
know like crazy hair or something's in
your teeth then you will actually be
able to catch it before importing all
the footage and having food in your
mouth my next favorite is a food item
this wouldn't even be like my January
favorites I would definitely consider
these like my 2014 favorites because
ever since Lexie moved in she has gotten
hooked on quest bars oh my goodness I
couldn't even tell you guys how many I
eat of these per week
they are so freakin good and Lexie and I
just got a bunch of new packages today
so I'm like so excited because they're
full and I actually already had one like
we're right before filming this video so
these are my two favorite flavors we've
got the chocolate brownie so good oh my
gosh if you guys put these in the
microwave for 19 seconds it's all chewy
and soft and warm and oh my god it
tastes like a real brownie and then I
also really really love the cookies and
cream flavor oh my god they're just
amazing and I'm gonna stop talking about
them because I'm probably annoying you
guys on to the next my next favorite
which I am so excited to talk about is
my planner for 2015 and these little
sticker dots so I'm very particular with
what type of planner I like to use this
flower is from the brand sugar paper and
I found last year's planner at a Target
store so you can probably find them at
your target but for some reason I
couldn't find any 2015 calendars so I
went on Amazon and BOTS like the
second-to-last planner of this style I
like all of their planners in general
but this one specifically is my favorite
I love the size I love how everything is
laid out so if you guys are wondering
specifically what type of calendar this
is it is the 8.5 x 11 2015 weekly and
monthly planner if you can get your
hands on it I seriously recommend it it
is amazing so let's get into detail
about where I love it so much for
starters you've got all of your months
to the side and you have a large
calendar of everything so that you can
see your month as a whole and this is
where the dot stickers come into play
you can get these at Target that's where
I get them and basically I use these to
organize my uploading schedule and
videos that I upload and basically well
do is just stick them onto the squares
of whatever day I upload them and it
gives me kind of a bigger picture of
when I'm uploading and how often I'm
uploading so I really love that and the
reason why I love this planner is
because it's the perfect like size so
the dots fit perfectly and I have more
room to write other things and once you
open up to the next page
your weeks of starts and I also really
like how this is lit up you have a bunch
of lines for every single day so this is
where I'll write my to-do lists or
things that I just need to remember
sometimes I love what I eat if I feel
like I've been eating really unhealthy
so it's awesome and you have that
basically for the next month and then it
starts right over this may not be is
interesting for some of you guys but for
some reason I have this huge obsession
with plenty outs and organizing my life
and you know highlighting different
things and things like that I don't know
man I just get some sort of rush I know
my guys like to listen to my music
favorites for the month so I would have
two of them linked in the description
box just to save your guys's time you
can click on that and listen to them I
think that's it for today's video if you
guys enjoy it then be sure to give it a
big thumbs up and like it so that I know
if you guys like favorites videos

also have my Instagram and Twitter over

video I will see you guys for a new one
next week on Tuesday if you guys have
noticed yet I've been uploading every
single Tuesday and Friday so I'm super
happy to finally have a schedule but
yeah I will talk to you guys very soon
