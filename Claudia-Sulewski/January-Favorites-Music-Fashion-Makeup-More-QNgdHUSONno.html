so today I am going to be showing you
guys a bunch of the things that I have
been loving for the past month I don't
really have anything else to say I think
that's it for the intro yeah so for my
first favorite we're gonna start off
with the more obvious one basically I
got it done we chopped it a little
shorter because my ends were so gross
and so dead
and also added in a bunch of highlights
throughout the hair Stephan and Donovan
did such a good job on my hair I'll link
their instagrams down below but I
basically just came in and was like guys
do something with my hair I just both of
you get it done and yeah I am totally
obsessed with how it turned out it just
feels nice to have something different
and have something going on with my hair
because it was just so dark and brown
and boring for so long and it feels nice
to have things kind of lightened up so
I'm actually gonna start off with my
fashion favorites because I definitely
am more excited about those and I have
more of them a vs. make up so quick
start time before I show you guys any of
this stuff but I feel like around fall
and winter time of last year I kind of
fell into a fashion funk I kind of
mentioned it in my haul with Maddie yeah
I feel like I just got in this weird
funk of just buying really simple things
and not really expressing myself through
my style also there's definitely a very
particular look that a lot of people out
here in LA where and I kind of without
even realizing it started feeling
pressure to kind of fall into the same
trends and yeah it was weird I just
wasn't happy with any of my outfits and
I wasn't excited to shop and all that
stuff and I think I made the realization
a few weeks ago randomly one night when
I was actually sitting on Pinterest I
have a Pinterest now never thought I'd
ever say that ever but I'm addicted guys
Pinterest is so much fun but anyways but
I remember just looking at outfits on
Pinterest and stuff and I realized that
I haven't bought something that I've
loved in so long and I kind of lost like
the girlier
me I remember when I was super into
fashion I would always wear skirts and
just awesome cool unique pieces like
shirts with holes on them that are
velvet and things like that I don't know
I just stopped dressing as girly and as
different as I used to
and instantly that night I went online
shopping and it felt so good to just buy
whatever and I just felt like I was back
in business
so I'm currently loving fashion right
now sorry for that long tangent but the
first fashion favorites of this past
month is belts I am having so much fun
with belts right now it was actually
never really thing that I got into but
the first one is from Nasty Gal it's a
black leather belt and it has these two
little silver buckles I love how it
still looks really edgy and simple but
it kind of has like a Western vibe to it
and then the other one is a little newer
and it's kind of crazy but it is a
cheetah belts I love it I don't know why
I wore it the other day with
high-waisted jeans shorts and just like
a simple white graphic tee and it just
looks so cute I've also been getting
into skirts again guys it's like Claudia
became a girl again this month what's
going on I don't know but I'm loving it
specifically a line skirts as you can
see I have a few of them here so I'm
going to quickly run through them I've
got this like navy blue corduroy collar
I've also been wearing color a lot more
lately which is also a new thing but
this is like a navy blue corner a skirt
from Urban Outfitters
this one's really cute it's from brandy
melville it's got buttons in the front
and it's just like a little denim a line
skirt this suede one is from Lulu's comm
and it's got little like panels on it
and it's a really pretty tan color and
then my newest one is this cheetah print
skirt which is from Topshop and I
actually bought it online but guys the
fit of this skirt is so flattering and
so cute I'm just completely in love with
it and I love how crazy it is next up
I've been really into two tops lately
which is so funny because I literally
remember loving a tube tops when I was
super young back then like cheetah girls
was a thing and you know early 2000s and
yeah it's just funny that like 16 years
later I am now buying tube tops again
but both of these are from Urban
Outfitters the first one is this really
really pretty like muted lilac gray
color
I don't know I'm completely obsessed
with it and then I have the same exact
shirt but in black my last fashion
favorites is stuck to anger our necklace
is specifically like choker
stringing necklaces so I have three here
my first favorites is this one right
here it's super simple it's just a black
suede cord and basically you just wrap
it around your neck however many times
you want you can tie it and then I have
a kind of similar one from three people
that I wore in my haul with Maddie but
it's got a few more necklaces on the
front and then it goes longer to this
thing at the end whatever you want to
call it also this is getting me super
excited for Coachella I'm going weekend
one and you best believe I'm gonna be
wearing all of these crazy necklaces
yeah those are all the fashion II things
that I've been loving now for makeup I
only have two products the first one is
actually not very new I've definitely
talked about this with you guys but I
kind of rediscovered my love for it it
is the Amazonian clay full coverage
airbrush foundation specifically I have
been loving wearing this product alone
nowadays I really hate wearing a lot of
cakey foundation literally as I'm
wearing cakey foundation right now but
it's throughout the week when I'm not
filming any videos I want to let my skin
breathe and I don't want to you know
have stuff a little break because I want
to like scratch it off by the end of the
day this stuff is super light but it
seriously is full coverage you can pack
it whoa almost dropped it but didn't
it's a new year guys it's definitely
buildable it covers all the
discoloration but it's also super
lightweight and I
I'm in the shade light/medium neutral
and then my second and last makeup
favorites is the makeup forever pro
sculpting duo little compact so when you
open up you've got a little bronzer side
and then on top you have a highlighter
and when it comes to using bronzer and
contouring my face I like to stick with
matte products I don't like having too
many sparkles on my face so I don't
necessarily use the bronzer as a bronzer
but I've actually been loving it as a
blush because it has the most perfect
sunkissed glow a peachy orange color as
you guys can see it's on my hand right
now
and I am all about peachy blushes I
prefer them over paint blush anytime I'm
traveling this is the only highlighter
and blush that I'll bring with me
because it's so easy and I am really
really pleased with both of them so now
I'm getting more into the miscellaneous
things that the first one is a sports
bra so this bra is from a Victoria's
Secret I absolutely love their sports
bras are so comfortable they're so cute
and they just fit really nicely and I am
obsessed with this one because it has a
zipper down the front guys I am the type
of person that when I put on a bra I
have to twist it backwards clip it in
the front twist it back around and then
put the straps on for some reason I
can't do the whole clip thing if there's
more than one clip that you have to do
you know how like the clip staff usually
there's two I don't know like weird
things happen back there I don't know I
can't do it so finding a bra surviving a
sports bra that has a zipper in the
front and that it unhooks in the front
just makes life so much easier so my
next favorite is a little random but if
you guys follow me on my second channel
where I vlog pretty much every week you
would know that my
and I have been absolutely obsessed with
the board game lately Catan it might
actually be pronounced Catan but we like
to say Catan I don't really care you
don't have to comment about it in the
downbar I personally like to say Catan
because it just I don't know it's a
thing like we shout it anytime one of us
wants to play well like shout good yeah
and like wherever we are and then
everyone else says Catan and then we all
meet at the Catan table our dining table
because it's always there and we
basically just battle it out we usually
play three to four players but it is so
fun you're basically trading goods and
using those goods to buy cities and
build roads I'm really describing this
poorly but just trust me when I say you
need it in your life and if you buy it
please to it it to me because I love
when you guys tweet me this stuff my
next favorite was actually an experience
that me let's see drew and Alex got to
do which was take a quick little weekend
trip to San Francisco that was my first
time going and I absolutely loved it I
met a bunch of you guys there in general
all of the human interactions there were
so pleasant
everyone is so extroverted and friendly
out there and yeah I actually blogged
every single day of that trip so if you
guys want to check them out then I will
have all three of my San Francisco blogs
links down below but things got
interesting you know people got stuck in
bathrooms I drank out of the toilets we
played lots of Catan and basically just
ventured a bunch of places it was good
time
my next favorite has to do with food it
is a recipe that I've been making a
bunch lately basically it's a healthier
version of a pizza what I'll do is start
off with a slice of lavash bread which
is basically just a really thin flat
bread that's like a big square I'll
usually cut it down the middle to have
two smaller pizzas and I'll add on some
fat free like pizza sauce from Trader
Joe's that tastes so bomb and because of
that sauce tasting like pizza you can
essentially put whatever you want on top
I try to stay away from dairy because
it's really not that good for you so on
top I'll skip out on the cheese but I'll
basically just put on a bunch of
vegetables
honestly anything you want will taste
good on there also just putting fresh
arugula on top once you take it on the
oven but it is so freakin bomb
I could literally that pizza three times
a day every single day is so good and
you basically just put it in the oven
for about 16 minutes at about 380
degrees that's what I found works best
for me I'm gonna look through my phone
and see if I have any music favorites
for you guys because I know you guys
like when I include those as well
oh ooh guys okay well for starters I'm
going to link both of my winter
playlists from Spotify I have a winter
2015 playlist and I just started a
winter 2016 playlist I did want to
mention one of my favorite artists of
the month I'm not sure if it's one
person or if it's a band but they are
called Luis del Mar it's just so
different than anything I've ever heard
before
it's very alternative but also kind of
experimental and electronic there's a
lot of different noises and sounds that
kind of play into the music and it all
comes together so amazingly so I'm gonna
give you guys a quick little preview of
one of their songs so here is malt
liquor
like okay guys you need to blast this in
a car it sounds so good with loud big
speakers because there are just so many
different sounds going on and it sounds
so cool so I really like that one loud
eeee
this is the first song that I found from
them
this one
never be like you featuring Chi by flume
also incredible song
it's so good I wish I could just force
all of you guys into a huge car and just
blast all this not off of like my little
phone but seriously it's such a great
song this is more of a guilty pleasure
but I've seriously been bumping in my
house by Flo Rida I don't know why but
it makes me so happy
I don't I don't know okay you really
like it let's wrap this video up I feel
like I've been filming for 40 minutes I
hope you guys enjoyed watching today's
video I had so much fun filming it and
just sitting down with you guys I will
talk to you guys very soon next week to
be exact and I hope you guys have a
great one
