filming a July favorites for you guys I
actually did not film a June favorites
video so I feel like I haven't done it
very well but I do like making these
videos so that is what I'm doing today
also a side note I apologize my hair is
a really weird bluey purple gray color
right now I'm currently on one of those
days where I'm going to be retouching it
like tomorrow so it's a very strange
color right now just as most of you guys
know I moved to California in July so
obviously that has to be one of my
favorites just moving here in general
with this little sweetie pie I also
bought my first and very own car which
is awesome here is a beautiful little
photo of it I'm obsessed with it it's
name it's just a car do not interrupt me
thank you very much lots of new and big
changes this past month it's been crazy
but it's been so much fun so now I'm
gonna get into these smaller objects and
I have chillin over here on my back
first starters I'm just going to start
off with fashion I don't know why my
first favorite is actually a flannel and
I usually don't do clothing favorites
but I've just been really really liking
this one so this funnel is from brandy
melville it's got a 32 on the back I
really like the colors it's like a navy
blue color and a bed and white wow I
just realized it's red blue and white I
didn't realize that my next fashion
favorite would have to be these boots
right here and I have been wearing these
pretty much every single night I go out
here in LA I also wear these to VidCon
as well although I must warn you guys
that if you guys are interested in
getting these they will make your feet
bleed they made my heels bleed a lot at
VidCon and I wasn't paying for a long
time but now it's worth it because they
broke in and they're super cute so I got
these from Topshop they were pretty
expensive but I wear these all the time
and I really like them next up I've got
a few beauty products and I didn't
really try out too many new products I
feel like I always say this but I do
have a few so the first two are
coincidentally both from Maybelline but
this is the Maybelline master highlight
highlighting it blush basically it's
just a blush that has
little shimmers in it and there's like
different colors in it as well but what
I like to do with this is apply it on
the tops of my cheekbones and I feel
like it gives a really like subtle
shimmery duty luck so I've been really
liking this as just kind of like a mix
of blush and highlight so it's two steps
in one my next favorite makeup product
would have to be I literally use this so
many times that you can't even read what
it says I believe it is the dream Lumi
concealer something like that but it's
also from Maybelline and I've just been
applying this in a v-shape underneath my
eyes and I really like it I ran out of
the Maybelline Maybelline age rewind age
rewind concealer that one is really good
as well but I decided to try this one
because I ran out of that one right
there and beauty related favourites is
actually not a makeup product but it is
the complete opposite it is the benefit
they're real remover and what I
initially got this I didn't really think
that I would use it because I usually
just wash my makeup off my face or use
like a wiper or whatever but what I like
to do with this is since it just kind of
pumps out and it's like a white sticky
consistency I've mostly used this makeup
remover to wash off any eyeliner because
I like to do winged eyeliner pretty much
every single day and sometimes you just
kind of mess up so what I like to do is
apply a little bit onto a q-tip and then
just kind of quickly rub it off so I
find that this is great if you mess up
on your makeup while you're doing your
makeup because it's really easy just to
kind of quickly fix it up and retouch it
and stuff so I've been really liking
this for eyeliner
my next favorite would have to be a
hairbrush and shout out to Lindsey
Beauty b44 also shout-out to Aspen's but
Lindsey recommended this brush to me and
she said that it was really good so I
tried it out and it's called the wet
brush it's actually pretty popular it
gets all of the knots and tangles out
and my hair gets really really naughty
but it's also very thin so it breaks
very easily and this brush is just
amazing for my jewelry favourites I've
been kind of liking a certain type of
jewelry and it would have to
chokers I know I am like 5 million years
behind the trend but I think it's really
cute so these two I've been loving
especially lately so this one right here
I wear this in my last video and a bunch
of you guys were asking where I got it
so I got this one from Topshop I like
how it's really chunky and it's got like
a little teardrop diamond type thing in
the middle so I've been really really
liking that one and this one is a little
bit more simple it's kind of like a
thicker gold chain and I believe I got
this from a sauce
ASOS calm my next favourite would have
to be a face lotion and this is from
first date Beauty it is the ultra Repair
lotion and for a while I was using their
ultra Repair Cream so it's kind of like
the same thing but I like this one
because it's a little bit thinner it's
not as like creamy and thick as the
other one so I kind of dedicated
dedicated use that one for my body I
don't know what I was trying to say
there and this other I like to use for
my face because it's a little bit
lighter on the stand so it doesn't feel
it's heavy and it also kind of soaks
into your skin a lot faster so I've been
using this pretty much every single
morning and nights my next server it is
very very random I've got a lot of
different like decor pieces that I've
been loving lately because I've been
redesigning my new room and stuff like
that so I wanted to show you guys one of
the pieces that I've been especially
loving and it is this little white box
right here what could it be it is a
jewelry holder so I got this from the
Container Store and I really like it
because it has different layers to it so
you can have different things in here so
let's just do a little what's in my
jewelry box the first layer has two
containers and I've been just putting
like necklaces bracelets stuff like that
you've got a smaller one with little
triangles so I put my rings in here oh
my god was not supposed to happen
lovely the next layer has even bigger
diamonds and dividers and
last one is just a container so this has
become really handy for my jewelry it
doesn't take a lot of space and it also
has like that geometric kind of feel
that I have going on in my room so yeah
I will set this down now my next two
favorites are actually the same thing
but they're different scents and these
are the bath and Bodyworks
concentrated room sprays the two scents
that I have are fresh linen and mahogany
teak wood I actually have not used this
one yet I'm kind of afraid that it's
gonna be like super you like this I
don't know how strong it's gonna be if
it accustoms gonna yell at me but I know
you like a hundred handle things oh my
gosh and then the second one is fresh
linen which is the one that I've been
using lately and I really like just
spraying this around my room and I also
just sprayed on my bed and stuff because
it smells like fresh linen and that kind
of just made sense in my mind I don't
know yeah good she doesn't like it she's
like my next favorites are really really
exciting so Aston I actually got two
dogs so here's our first dog he's white
very we still have to potty train him
he's been peeing everywhere and you guys
keep tweeting me photos of Russell like
being in stores and like outside of the
house I really don't know who's letting
him out I didn't do it my mom actually
thought that Russell would be kind of
lonely so she thought hey let's just buy
a second dog let me go get Simon fine
so this is Simon here's a little bit
darker Oh Shh she gets nervous on camera
he's like a nice silvery color super
little still a little puppy and he's a
wiener dog we love wiener dogs
we love wieners here
my first favorite would have to be
monogamy by cherub and I think Lindsey
and Megan and Alex showed me this song
but we have been playing this song
non-stop and every single car ID and it
is so good so let me just play a little
preview for you guys sounds like I've
also been listening to a lot of
throwback songs and you guys have been
noticing on Spotify because you guys
tweet me all the time when it says
Claudia Lucy is listening to burn it up
by the Jonas Brothers which by the way
is one of my favorite songs this month
so just gonna play a little preview that
even though you guys totally know what
this song sounds like oh I swear guys
I've been listening to these songs like
every single day on a more serious note
I've also been really liking the song I
feel like I said this in my last one I
don't know you and me Bauer remix
yeah so I feel like I already talked
about that one I don't know but it is
great to listen to on like the loudest
volume as well as the you and me remix
the phlume remix that one is also really
really good if I have any other favorite
songs I'll just list them in the downbar
because I highly doubt you guys enjoy
watching me sing the songs for you not
