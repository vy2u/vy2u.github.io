filming a July favorites for you guys
actually did not film a June favorites
video so I feel like I haven't done it
very well but I do like making these
videos so that is what I'm doing today
also side note I apologize my hair is a
really weird bleep purple gray color
right now i'm currently on one of those
days where i'm going to be retouching it
like tomorrow so it's a very strange
color right now as most of you guys know
i moved to california in july so
obviously that has to be one of my
favorites just moving here in general
with this little sweetie pie they're
gonna be like what was yeah i also
bought my first and very own car which
was awesome here is a beautiful little
photo of it i'm obsessed with it its
name is Jessa car do not interrupt me
thank you very much lots of new and big
changes this past month it's been crazy
but it's been so much fun so now I'm
going to get into these smaller objects
and I have chillin over here on my back
first starters I'm just going to start
off with fashion I don't know why my
first favorite is actually a flannel and
I usually don't do clothing favorites
but I've just been really really like in
this one so this funnel is from brandy
melville it's got a 32 on the back I
really like the colors it's like a navy
blue color and a bed and white wow I
just realized it's red blue and white I
didn't realize that my next fashion
favorite would have to be these boots
right here and i have been wearing these
pretty much every single night I go out
here in LA I also wore these to VidCon
as well although I must warn you guys
that if you guys are interested in
getting these they will make your feet
bleed they made my heels bleed a lot at
VidCon and I wasn't paying for a long
time but now it's worth it because they
broke in and they're super cute so I got
these from Topshop they were pretty
expensive but I wear these all the time
and I really like them next up I've got
a few beauty products and I didn't
try out too many new products I feel
like I always say this but I do have a
few so the first two are coincidentally
bold from Maybelline but this is the
Maybelline master highlight highlighting
it blush basically it's just a blush
that has little shimmers in it and
there's like different colors in it as
well but what I like to do with this is
apply it on the tops of my cheekbones
and I feel like it gives a really like
subtle shimmer ii do ii luck so I've
been really liking this as just kind of
like a mix of blush and highlight so
it's two steps in one my next favorite
makeup product would have to be I little
use this so many times that you can't
even read what it says I believe it is
the dream lumi concealer something like
that but it's also from Maybelline and
I've just been applying this in AV shape
underneath my eyes and I really like it
I ran out of the Maybelline maybelline
age rewind adria on concealer that one
is really good as well but I decided to
try this one because I ran out of that
one by there and beauty related favorite
is actually not a makeup product but it
is the complete opposite it is the
benefit they're real remover and what I
initially got this I didn't really think
that I would use it because I usually
just wash my makeup off my face or use
like a wiper or whatever but what I like
to do with this is since it just kind of
pumps out and it's like a white sticky
consistency I've also used this makeup
remover to wash off any eyeliner because
i like to do winged eyeliner pretty much
every single day and sometimes you just
kind of mess up so what I like to do is
apply a little bit onto a q-tip and then
just kind of quickly rub it off so I
find that this is great if you mess up
on your makeup while you're doing your
makeup because it's really easy just to
kind of quickly fix it up and retouch
and stuff so I've been really liking
this for eyeliner my next favorite would
have to be a hairbrush and shout out to
Lindsey beauty v44 also shout out to
Aspen's but Lindsey recommended this
brush to me and she said that it was
really good so I tried it out and it's
called the wet brush it's actually
pretty popular it gets all of the knots
and tangles out and my hair gets really
really naughty but it's also very thin
so it breaks very easily and this brush
is
amazing for my jewelry favorites I've
been kind of liking a certain type of
jewelry and it would have to be chokers
I know I am like five million years
behind the trend but I think it's really
cute so these 2 i've been loving
especially lately so this one right here
I wear this in my last video and a bunch
of you guys were asking where i got it
so i got this one from Topshop I like
how it's really chunky and it's got like
a little teardrop diamond type thing in
the middle so I've been really liking
that one and this one is a little bit
more simple it's kind of like a thicker
gold chain and I believe I got this from
a sauce asos.com my next favorite would
have to be a face lotion and this is
from first aid Beauty it is the ultra
Repair lotion and for a while I was
using their ultra Repair Cream so it's
kind of like the same thing but I like
this one because it's a little bit
thinner it's not as like creamy and
thick as the other one so I kind of
dedicated dedicated use that one for my
body I don't know what I was trying to
stay there and this other takes for my
face because it's a little bit lighter
on the stand so it doesn't feel it's
heavy and it also kind of soaks into
your skin a lot faster so I've been
using this pretty much every single
morning and nights my next favorite is
very very random I've got a lot of
different like decor pieces that I've
been loving lately because i've been
redesigning my new room and stuff like
that so i wanted to show you guys one of
the pieces that I've been especially
loving and it is this little white box
right here what could it be it is a it's
a jewelry holder so I got this from the
container store and I really like it
because it has different layers to it so
you can have different things in here so
let's just do a little what's in my
jewelry box the first layer has two
containers and I've been just putting
like necklaces bracelets stuff like that
you've got a smaller one with little
triangles so i put my rings in here oh
my god he was not supposed to happen
lovely the next layer has even bigger
diamonds and dividers and then the last
one is just a container so this has
become really handy for my jewelry it
doesn't take a lot of space and it also
has like that geometric kind of feel
that I have going on in my room so yeah
I will set this down now my next to
favorites are actually the same thing
but they're different sense and these
are the bath and Bodyworks concentrated
room sprays the two cents that I have
our fresh linen and mahogany teak wood I
actually have not used this one yet I'm
kind of afraid that it's gonna be like
super hmm you like this mm-hmm I don't
know how strong it's gonna be a filha
castings gonna yell at me but I know
like it you like I said just like public
a hundred lake handle things hastens oh
my gosh and then the second one is fresh
linen which is the one that I've been
using lately and i really like just
spring this around my room and I also
just ran on my bed and stuff because it
smells like fresh linen and that kind of
just made sense in my mind Oh No yes
good she doesn't like it she's lying my
next favorites are really really
exciting so Aston I actually got two
dogs
Oh Russell is so cute so here's our
first dog he's white very um we still
have to potty train him he's been paying
everywhere and you guys keep tweeting me
photos of Russell like being in stores
and like outside of the house I really
don't know who's letting him out I
didn't do it my mom actually thought
that Russell would be kind of lonely so
she thought hey let's just buy a second
dog let me go get Simon fine Spartan
famous I'm so this is Simon here's a
little bit darker oh she gets
nervous on camera he's like a nice
silvery color super little still a
little puppy and he's a weiner dog we
love wiener dogs we love wieners here my
first favorite would have to be monogamy
by cherub and I think Lindsey and Megan
and Alex showed me this song but we have
been playing this song non stop in every
single car I'd and it is so good so let
me just play a little preview for you

that song that song sounds like I've
also been listening to a lot of
throwback songs and you guys have been
noticing on Spotify because you guys

claudius loose key is listening to burn
it up by the Jonas Brothers which by the
way is one of my favorite song this
month so just gonna play a little
preview that you know you guys totally
know what this song sounds like oh my
god I messed up again I swear guys I've
been listening to these songs like every
single day on a more serious note i've
also been really liking the song i feel
like i said this in my last one I don't
know you and me baauer remix
yeah so I feel like I already talked
about that one I don't know but it is
great to listen to on like the loudest
volume as well as the you and me remix
