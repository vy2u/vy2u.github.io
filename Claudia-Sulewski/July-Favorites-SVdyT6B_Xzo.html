my July favorites and this month has
gone by so fast just summer itself has
gone by so fast which really sucks but I
did finish summer school last week which
is good because now I have more time to
film videos if you guys are wondering I
took summer school to get ahead for next
year so I'm taking some of the classes
that are required for next year just
that you know like I have them out of
the way so it's not because I like
family new classes or anything that's
good right more time for filming and I
don't really have that many things to
show you guys because I don't really
purchase that many things this month and
if I did then I most likely showed it in
like a vlog video or a halt um so that's
pretty much it I'm just gonna get right
into it my first favorites are pretty
random but they are so prox here is like
their little thing they're just called
soap rocks and you can I really don't
know where you can buy these but they do
have a website which is so prox calm and
this really sounds like a sponsor video
but it's not my mom actually bought
these for me when my mom and my dad went
to Las Vegas and they were coming back
home she felonies and store and she
bought me three different so Brock soaps
and they are seriously the coolest soaps
ever um I'll first show you guys my
least favorite one um it looks like this
it's just brown and black and I love how
they look too i already kind of chunk
out of this one this one is called
spalted maple and it just smells like
maple kind of foresty the next one is in
turquoise and it looks like this this
one's probably my favorite because it is
so freaking pretty I already cut a chunk
out of this one as well it just smells
like kind of Flowery I don't know but
yeah it just amazes me how much these
look like rocks it's so pretty the last
one is called opal and it looks like
this this one is also really really
pretty I have not used this one yet but
it smells flowery I don't kind of like
the other one but these lather really
well and they're not tested on
animals which is super great and they
also have a lot of like really good
ingredients in them like they have a lot
of organic like olive oil almond oil
palm oil all these like vitamins and all
that stuff's so you can see that right
there I just want to show you guys these
soaps because I think they would make
really great gifts and they're also fun
to buy for yourself because they're just
they're just so pretty my next favorite
is this little lip combo that I'm
wearing right now and I have not worn
this in a video yet but I'm wearing a
lip liner and a lip gloss so the lip
liner is from NYX and it is in sand
pinkk it looks like this there is a
swatch of it it's just like a kind of
dark rosy pink and then on top of that
I'm just wearing the mac dazzleglass in
sugar rimmed it's just a pale glittery
lip gloss so here is a swatch of it it's
very sure but it looks really pretty
when you put on top of other colors my
next favorite is a nail polish and it is
a silky nail polish in the shade to some
glow and match some wearing on my nails
right now it looks like that it's just a
creamy yellow color and it's so pretty
as this nail polish is from the brand
silky which I'm sure that a lot of you
are not very familiar with but it came
in this little kit right here or set I
guess and the yellow one is my favorite
these nail polishes are seriously
awesome I will be making another video
going more in depth about these nail
polishes so there's a ton of good things
about these nail polishes they're super
good they're called polished with a co
science um so yeah I'm just not going to
talk too much about it right now because
I want to dedicate it to a different
video in the future but I've just really
been liking the yellow one because it's
such a pretty color my next favorite is
a brush it is the Sigma flat kabuki f80
brush I normally don't wear that much
foundation over the summer time but
sometimes I will a little bit right here
because I get acting like the t-zone and
like the tops of my cheeks so when I do
use foundation I always use this brush
it looks like that it's very
they can dance at the top and it's very
soft and I really really enjoy it so my
next favorite is actually store and it
is plato's closet and I used to love it
but I kind of forgot about it for a
couple months but a couple weeks ago
maybe like two weeks ago or something
the one that's closest to me had a
really good sale going on so I decided
to stop by and this is one of the things
that I bought I ended up buying a lot of
stuff which I'm very happy about because
I got really good deals here's one of
the things is just a pink zip up
sweatshirt it's very simple but um I
don't know I really love black zip-up
sweatshirts from Victoria's Secret I
don't know why but it's really thick and
comfortable and I'm so excited to wear
this during the wintertime so that's
just one of the pieces that i got from
plato's closet but seriously if you guys
have never tried it out then i
definitely recommend going there because
they have really cute things they have
like forever 21 free people hmmm and
like all those different stores it's
really awesome so you should go there if
you have not gone yet my next favorite
is a food item and um of course it's
empty because I already ate it all but
they are the trader joes organic banana
chips they are really really good I love
them I've been eating them every single
day for the past like three days and I
finished the whole thing and they're
really good and I guess they're pretty
good for you I mean they're you know
better than like potato chips oh yeah
I've been liking these a lot so my next
favorite is a pair of shorts and I
actually got them yesterday but I
figured hey it's still july so I could
just include them in this video and
they're kind of wet because they were
supposed to be in the dryer right now
but I couldn't took them out to show you
guys but they are these vintage old
leave i heisted cut-offs and I love the
way the denim looks it's kind of like
acid wash and they look like that I got
these yesterday at an antique market for
only twenty dollars so it was such a
great deal I was so so so so excited I
literally like saw them right when i
walked in i was like i need to get those
I'm just currently obsessing
were these and I'm probably going to
wear them today once they're done drying
because they're still wet and yes so now
on to music so my first music favorite
is actually a YouTube video and it is
Kaylee Mackenzie's summer playlist she
basically just talked about a lot of her
favorite songs she listed 30 40 I don't
even know how many songs but literally I
love all of them i will leave a link to
her video in the downbar so you guys can
check it out I was literally like
staying there she like say a song pause
it get it download it okay next song
next song I literally got like every
single song because I love her taste in
music and its really good so I
definitely recommend checking out
Kaylee's video because all the music in
that video is just really good so now i
have three songs that are a little bit
different than the other songs that i
like these are more kind of like upbeat
party songs or whatever the first one is
called heads will roll and it's the
a-trak remix by the yeah yeah yeahs it
is a really really good song i have been
listening to it every single day i'm
really obsessed with it the next one is
cheap and cheerful and it's the
sebastian remix by The Kills really good
song it played in Project X which I
haven't seen yet but I just looked up
there soundtrack and yeah it is a really
really good song the next song is
walking on a dream and it's the kids at
the bar remix really good it's really
upbeat and it's just a very like happy
sounding song it puts me in a good mood
oh and then I actually have four songs
the last one is ugly by bassnectar this
is kind of an old song but it's
definitely a classic for me it is very
very very like dubstep e so probably
like fifty percent of you guys will hate
this song if you go look it up but it is
a really good song when you're like
blasting in the car or like I have a
little like speakers in my kitchen so I
will blast that in my kitchen and it
like
just sounds awesome when it's really
loud so check out that song if you're
into like dubstep music and that
concludes my favorites video I hope you
guys enjoyed it I know I didn't really
have that many interesting things and
that's it bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
