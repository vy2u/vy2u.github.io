comfortable because I literally just got
this box in the mail like 10 minutes ago
so I just there also make up and put on
a sweatshirt but today I'm going to be
doing another glossybox an opening tell
me if you guys like these because I
didn't do it for last month's because I
thought you guys would enjoy it more if
I like incorporated a lot of the
products and like other videos show you
guys how I use them in stuff but Kumble
and tell me if you guys like unboxing
videos and whether i should do that more
often or not and um yeah so let's just
get into it I have not opened this yet
the seal is still on um so yeah okay so
when you first open it you've got the
glossy mag just like a little magazine
then the actual box itself I love these
boxes they're so cute and when you open
up the box it looks like that so there's
a little card here that says GlossyBox
summer nights so I'm guessing that's
like the theme of this month's box I'm
excited to me okay yes dropped it course
I'm alright so I'm just going to start
going in order by this little sheet of
paper so the first product in this box
is the alessandro international peddick
steel rescue bomb which is actually like
destiny because yesterday i was
complaining about how dry my feet were
so i'm actually excited to use this but
it says that this foot cream oil
imported exclusively from germany
provides intense protection and
nourishes skin leaving it soft and
supple so it's very cute obviously oh
and by the way I didn't paint my nails
so try to ignore that but um let's smell
it just like any other foot product it
smells minty but it smells good so the
second product in here is the 0 for
cosmetics universal eyebrow pencil I
think they're like reading my mind with
this box because you guys know that I'm
running out of my bra so go go palette
and I was actually searching up
different eyebrow pencils to buy but I
couldn't like choose any of course they
have one in this box like this is insane
but I'm really really excited to use
this actually it's created with a
beeswax based
an effortless and long-lasting
application this water resistant pencils
perfect for even the most sensitive eyes
I am so excited to use this oh my gosh
so there's a swatch of it feel like it's
like Christmas and I'm like a little
good okay anyway so the third one is the
Sebastian color ignite multi-tone
shampoo and I think it's this one yes so
it's this bottle right here it says
smart color moisture complex that
targets your caller cheated stearns to
deeply moisturize and reconstruct hair
fibers wherever needed most so that's
that right there next is the Sebastian
color ignite multi-tone conditioner
which looks like this and this is
actually an interesting bottle look at
it wonder how that's gonna work out
let's try it well it's like a foam I'm
like a maze wait a conditioner that's a
foam and you guys have never seen
anything like that it's kind of cool oh
I'm excited to use this so it says this
microbubble conditioner whips wraps and
Wow's your strands leaving your hair
with long-lasting color and fiber trying
so the next one is the set of cosmetics
double dose lip lacquer this extremely
shiny gloss formula creates light
reflecting pigments that make your lips
appear fuller and hydrated vitamins and
jojoba oil is a high say I never get
that word right at extra conditioning it
to your pout so it looks like this you
guys know that I'm normally a new lips
girl but I'm willing to try it let's see
if it smells mmm suppose one smells good
it's like sugary there they are they're
pretty sheer so they're probably going
to be better putting over like a
lipstick or some sort of lip stain or
something like that cool cool then I
also have a special surprise treat for
you in the box and they are these
to almonds a nail hand and body like
lotions so there's two of those so
that's fun and that is it that is in
this month's box I am really really
excited to use this stuff especially the
where is it the foot lotion the eyebrow
pencil and probably the conditioner I'm
really excited to use these so far this
is probably my most favorite box tell me
your guys's thoughts on today's video in
the comments below I hope you guys
enjoyed it and that's it so I'm gonna go
put some foot lotion on my feet it was
not funny okay um all right I'll see you
guys later fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
