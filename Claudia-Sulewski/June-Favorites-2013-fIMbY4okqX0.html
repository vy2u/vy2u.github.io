doing my June favorites and I cannot
believe the month is over where did you
go I've got quite a few things to show
you guys so I'm just gonna get right
into it so I'm going to start out with
face makeup the first thing that I've
been loving this past month is the naked
urban decay flushed palette I've been
wanting this for ever since it came out
so I finally got my hands on it and it
looks like this if you guys have never
seen it before it has a bronzer a
highlight as well as a blush and this is
absolutely perfect for traveling
obviously because it's very compact and
small and portable and stuff the
highlight is in the middle and I like it
because it's not too light like some
highlights are just way too white and it
just looks very unnatural so this one
looks really nice especially with darker
skin tones during the summertime because
it's not as big as like a contrast love
the packaging it's like magnetic so it
just feels cool when you close it I'm
wearing all of this on my face right now
next up I've been loving the benefits
stay flawless 15-hour primer I don't
think this is out in stores yet it will
be coming out soon this month but it
looks like this the packaging is
absolutely adorable and I love it
because it is in stick form so it's very
easy if you're like in a Russian stuff
because you just rubbed all over your
face blend it out it's just so easy to
use and benefit is honestly my number
one favorite makeup brand I'm so I was
really excited to try this out when I
got my hands on it for concealer I've
been using the amazing cosmetics amazing
concealer and I don't know why it's
taken me this long to try it out but
this concealer is amazing it completely
covers every single blemish or under I
circle or whatever you have on your face
it completely erases it so I'm in the
shade medium golden and it perfectly
matches my skin I completely guessed in
the store and it's perfect for my shade
right now and honestly like half the
time i will just put this on my like any
imperfections and then i'll just put on
a powder and leave because
how amazing it is and I just love it so
much I was that generation beauty i was
able to try out a bunch of different
knicks products so i actually have for
that i've been loving so i'm going to
start out with the eyeliner this is the
liquid brown liner and I mean it's just
like your basic eyeliner and I just
really like it because I normally don't
use like liquid brown eyeliner but then
I got this one and I like it because
it's not as like dramatic as black
eyeliner it's a little bit more subtle
and it's great because i always do very
very natural looking like i make up like
this my eye makeup look today like it's
dark for me like this is considered like
dramatic so i've been using this
literally every single day for the past
few weeks and I really really like it
and it stays on all day so it's nice and
then I've also been loving these three
lip products are here I can't even
express my love for these right now I'm
wearing one of them right now it is the
butter gloss and this is in the shade
Eclair it is the perfect baby pink lip
color and I like to use this alone i
don't even have anything else on my lips
right now adjust this so it has really
nice pigmentation and I just feel like
it's very it stays on for a long time
and it's also very smooth so I'm very
very impressed by NYX lip products
lately I've just been loving them and
then also I have the butter gloss in
apple strudel this one also i've been
loving it's more of like a Corley color
so it's a little different from what I
normally wear because usually I go
towards like like pink lips but I've
been really really liking this one as
well now the last one is one of their
jumbo lip pencils and this is the first
time I've ever tried one of these and i
really like it this is in the shade
irish coffee and it's just like a light
pink shocker i like a light pink lip
product but one of the reasons why i
wanted to mention this in this video
it's kind of embarrassing but like I
don't know how to get more products like
I I mean I still have a bunch of the top
like you can't turn it are you supposed
to like
sharpen these are you supposed to
sharpen them like the jumbo eye pencils
are wooden so I know that I've to
sharpen them this one's plastic so I'm
not really sure what I'm supposed to do
I don't think you twist it up or
anything so I don't know what to do help
me next up I've got a few hair products
so the first one is the healthy sexy
hair soy renewal argan oil and I love
trying out different oils for my hair
because my hair is very very dry at the
bottom since I bleached all the time and
I've just been really liking this one I
think one of the main reasons is because
it comes in such a big bottle like this
is all oil in here so I was really
excited about that so this thing has
been lasting me for such a long time and
it's still like pretty much full and it
also smells really nice and it just
makes my hair very soft and stuff so I
also like to apply this to my hair right
before I brush it because my hair gets
super naughty and this kind of helps to
like work as like a detangler next up
I've got the big sexy hair volumizing a
dry shampoo I love trying out different
dry shampoos but I've been really liking
this one all I do is just kind of pick
up my hair usually I like do it with
like a brush but you just like spray it
in and shake it out like that so I'll
just do that all over my hair and it
gives a really nice volume and of course
it kind of helps control the oil in your
hair since it's a dry shampoo next up
I've got a skincare product and this is
from cleaning clears new line is it out
yet I'm not really sure but it's the
morning burst hydrating a gel
moisturizer and I thought this was so
fun I was so excited to use it i was
able to test it out when we were in New
York like a few months ago and I am
obsessed with this stuff this is the
first gel moisturizer that I've ever
used it's ultra lightweight it doesn't
clog your pores and its oil free and so
it basically comes out in a gel form
it's translucent and it just like melts
into your skin and just soaks in so fast
I don't know it's
for the summertime because it doesn't
leave your skin feeling all sticky or
anything like that and it just leaves it
very smooth and I just I've been
obsessed with it it also smells very
fresh which is nice I think it's
supposed to smell like cucumbers well
that's what it smells like to me so I've
been using this every single morning and
I love it I actually forgot to show you
guys one more hair product and it is the
Hot Tools clipless curling iron this is
in the large size I'm not really sure
like what the measurements are but I use
it on my hair today and I just really
like it because it heats up very fast
and it also has a little like
temperature thing here I just keep it
halfway so I don't know it's just very
nice and I like the size of this barrel
so I just want to show this to you guys
just in case if you want to know how I
like created these curls I it honestly
took me 10 minutes I just like took
random pieces curled it brushed it out
and put in some hairspray so I've been
using this like every single time with
chrome on here my next favorite has to
do with self-tanner and it is these
little st. Tropez like many MIT things I
think they're so adorable normally they
have like the bigger MIT's to use for
your body but these are specially made
for your face and they come in a pack of
3 i'm pretty sure this was like ten
dollars or something so it wasn't like
too bad they just fit your two fingers
and it's just adorable I don't know why
but yeah so I do use self tanner on my
face the st. Tropez bronzing mousse with
these my next favorite is a perfume and
I was so excited to talk about this
product because it is such a throwback
this perfume it used to be like my
signature scent in like eighth grade I
would say it is the victoria secret
super victoria secret supermodel sparkle
shimmering fragrant mist and it looks
like this the bottle is very pretty and
i am just in love with this scent I
can't even explain it it's not like
fruity it's not really florally it's
like I don't even know you aren't
honestly you just have to go to store
and smelly but it
smells so good and every time I smell it
just brings back so many amazing
memories so I just love wearing this a
lot I'm like smiling right now just like
smelling yet this is how pathetic I am I
just love it so next time you guys are
in the store I'd definitely check this
out and at least smell it because i'm
just so that is it for all of my beauty
related favorites for this month i
couldn't really find any fashion ones so
i don't have any of those starting july
first Aspen hot brilliance here on
YouTube and Lauren love Lauren Elizabeth
and I all decided to start a new and
healthy lifestyle because VidCon is
coming up and we're like we want to have
you know the perfect tone bods so we
like started a little group chat and we
always like send each other like photos
of like us eating and like we always
just update each other but we all
decided to kind of start eating
healthier and stuff working out every
single day so I did want to share with
you guys one of the meals that I've
recently been cooking a lot and just
absolutely loving so it is these two
things right here so they are both from
trader joe's this is the asian vegetable
stir-fry it's basically just a little
bowl of a bunch of different vegetables
there's nothing else in here like if you
look in the ingredients they don't add
any like salt or seasoning or anything
like that it's all just pure vegetables
and i always get this because it just
has like the perfect variety it has like
carrots onions broccoli like those
little corn things that no one knows
what they're called i don't know i'm
just too lazy to buy like a bunch of
vegetables and cut it up myself so this
is a lot faster for me so yeah usually i
will make like two meals out of this
because this is kind of a lot so i will
take these and I'll just put them in a
pan and stir fry them and then I will
add the trader joes sweet chili sauce I
don't add too much so they're not like
dripping and sauce but I just add a
little for some flavor and this stuff
tastes so good when you put them
together it honestly it tastes like
you're eating China
these food but it's like super healthy
so if you have a trader joes near you I
highly recommend buying these two and
trying them out because I love it now as
far as music favorites go I did not plan
ahead so i will just leave links in the
dunbar to a few of the songs that I've
been enjoying this month so you guys can
definitely check those out and I would
have to say that is it for today's video
I'll talk to you guys very soon and that
is it bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
