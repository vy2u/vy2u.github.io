my June favorites and I'm sorry the
quality of this video is worse or kind
of different that's because i'm using my
sony cybershot because I just filmed
this hair tutorial but the memory on my
other camera that I normally use is all
filled up other than that I really have
nothing else to say so let's just get
right into it so my first favorite has
got to be the wonderstruck Taylor Swift
perfume the bottle itself is so pretty i
love the packaging and all these little
charms right here umm it smells very
sweet just like everyone else on youtube
i suck at describing sense but it's just
really sweet and feminine smelling and i
really like it so i've been using this
like this entire month so my next
favorite is the book eyeshadow from the
first naked palette which looks like
this it's just matt and it's like a
chocolaty Brown kind of eye shadow and I
have been obsessed with wearing very
kind of natural looking makeup for
example right now all I'm wearing is
mascara and just buck in the crease I
have been wearing this eyeshadow every
single day in the crease I don't wear
because normally like I used to never
really wear eyeshadow on a daily basis
but every single day even if I'm not
wearing mascara and eyeliner I have to
put buck in my crease I don't know why
I'm just so used to having it in my
crease and I just really like the way it
defines my eyes I think this is like the
perfect eyeshadow for me so I've been
using this every single day for the past
like three months so absolutely love
that eyeshadow and yeah that's all I
really have to say about it my next
favorite are blotting sheets and
normally I never really used these
because my face isn't really that oily
but since it is summertime I get sweaty
really really easily like on my forehead
on my nose so I do like to carry it
blotting sheets around in my purse
everywhere I go so that I could quickly
blot my face if I'm feeling hot or
sweaty and these are just the Hello
Kitty limited edition ones from clean
and clear they just look like this and
um
they're just blue I don't know I thought
the packaging is really cute so I just
carry these around everywhere I go my
next favorite is a nail polish and I'm
actually wearing it on my nails right
now I'm sure I shown you guys this
before because I got this a long time
ago but it's the SE lilac ISM and it
just looks like that I think it's so
cute for summer and I just I love purple
it's my favorite color if you guys to
know that so I've just been currently
obsessed with having this on my nails so
my next favorite might be kind of weird
but it's a bathing suit for a Victoria's
Secret and i purchased this online like
about a week ago i got it in last week
and i got it because of the semi-annual
sale so it was on a really good deal so
the top looks like this it's kind of
like one of those bra styles and it's
like white with like Gold's leopard
print or cheetah print and then there's
a black bow in the middle with white
stripes on it so the top looks like this
and then I also got the matching bottoms
because normally I don't really buy the
bottoms from Victoria's Secret I'll just
match them with some black ones from
like Target or something because they're
so expensive but I thought I felt like
this bathing suit I just had to get the
bottoms to just complete it also the
bottoms look like this and they also
just have those black bows with the
polka dots on the sides and I love this
bathing suit because it looks so good
when you have a tan and it looks really
good with my blonde hair so I've been
loving that and it was just in a really
good deal so I figured why not buy it so
my next favorite actually got this a
couple months ago but I don't think I've
ever even talked about it it's my makeup
bag this is from Vera Bradley this is
the medium sized makeup bag I absolutely
love this normally I'll just carry it in
my purse and I bring like my
louisvuitton or like a bigger purse
because they're only I bring satchels
with me so this obviously doesn't fit in
a satchel but when I bigger bags don't
put in here but lately I've been going
to the beach with my friends pretty much
like every single weekend two times a
week and this is great for carrying my
makeup in my beach bag I love the inside
of it because it's like plastic so if
you spill anything in here if anything
like melts or breaks in here
that it's so easy to clean up and this
print is called the island blooms or
something like that i'm not really sure
but it actually matches my wallet too i
did on purpose and i'ma geek but yeah
the pattern inside is really cool too
it's more like you can see there it's
kind of like squares um and yeah and
that's just like flowers on the outside
so I love this so much i've been using
this especially when i go to the beach
so yeah so that is it for my makeup and
beauty and fashion favorites I don't
really have that many this month but now
i'm just going to list off some of my
favorite none of that related items i
guess im so first I'm gonna start out
with TV shows I have been obsessed with
prison break um where I live basically
everyone is just watching her and now
everyone is obsessing over everyone's
just talking about it um I love prison
break so much the main character is so
good-looking and I don't know I just
love the conflict the plot and
everything I actually blogged about it
and i just upload that yesterday um so
I'm gonna link my newest video on my
second channel down there so you can see
it I kind of talked about it for a
little bit but I've been loving prison
break if you have not seen it watch it
it is so good and then also one of my
favorites I actually just finished all
the seasons on netflix so I'm not really
watching anymore but it's 90210 I
tweeted about it for a little bit it is
such a good show I love it so much um
but sadly I finished all the episodes of
Netflix so I'm no longer going to be
watching it unless they add more seasons
I don't even know if there's any more
seasons but yeah and then for some
favorites one of them is take you higher
I don't even know who it's by it's like
some weird name but i will link like the
song and the downbar so you guys can
hear it's a really good song so my other
song favorite is i'm not over by okay
i've been having trouble saying this
Caroline a liar there you go so I think
it's called I'm not over it's a really
old song but I've been listening to it
like crazy lately and I just love it I
love the tune and everything about it so
I last favorite is actually an
up and it's called keek it looks like
this it's basically where you can pull
house really short videos and I think
the long as they can be is like 36
seconds I'm obsessed with Kylie and
Kendall Jenner's Keeks they are so funny
and it's really cool getting to like see
more of their lives because I'm like
obsessed with them but um yeah I made a
keek and I think my username is Claudius
life i'm not sure i'll leave in the
downbar it will say like Mikey Kizer
name and then you can see it i'm not
sure i think it is claudia's life I
don't know but every time I post a peek
