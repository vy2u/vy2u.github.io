before we get started with today's video
I quickly wanted to mention that I'm
throwing a little summer giveaway on my
Twitter and Instagram so if any of you
guys are interested in winning these
prizes or these prizes then keep on
watching until the end of the video
where I talk about how you can enter ok
now let's get into the video I am
actually really excited to film this
video because this box has been sitting
here for about a week and I've just been
waiting to film it yes we are doing an
unboxing and first impressions on the
Kylie lip kits oh my god
quick side no it is over 100 degrees in
LA right now and I have to turn off the
a/c in order to film with clear audio so
if I just start to get progressively
sweaty in today's video I'm sorry
starting off with packaging I think it
looks so sick the aesthetic of all of it
is very badass but still very girly and
quite enjoy that so I'm gonna start off
with the lip glosses because I feel like
I will get the truest color if I just do
it on my natural lips with nothing I got
literally and like very interesting
shade tiles
okay so I am starting off with literally
just by swatching it I can tell that
it's very pigmented oh yeah dude I
really like this
also they smell really good they smelly
sweet if these lip glosses stay on and
the pigmentation doesn't move around
I am so highly impressed with this
honestly it's more of like a lip cream
than a lip gloss I would say because
it's a lot more pigmented but this is
such a pretty color I am so excited okay
wow what a great start next up I'm gonna
try out like so like is definitely
darker I don't know if this is the
darkest one because there were three lip
glosses I think I feel like this shade
is very similar to literally but just a
few shades darker because it still has
that peachy undertone and I'm
excited to see if these last a long time
if they do I'm sure I'll mention them in
my next favourites video so now I have
got five different shades to try out and
I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
apply one of them right now and wear it
for the rest of the video to see how it
looks at the end of the video to see if
this move around and then the rest I'm
just gonna be showing you guys close-ups
I think I'm gonna try on candy Kay first
but yeah the packaging is just a little
square and inside every kit you get a
lip liner and a matte liquid lipstick I
am all about liquid lipsticks right now
I really really like the jeffree star
ones as well as the NYX lingerie ones
those are so good I talk about them all
the time let's do it
so right now I'm just wearing the lip
liner and once again I am very very
impressed like this stuff is really
pigmented and it's also very creamy
genuinely very excited to have a lip
liner in all of these shades because
I've heard that these can get drying so
even if I don't end up liking these I
can definitely wear the lip liner alone
or underneath other stuff
so the fact that you have the option of
two different products in the same color
is really cool so I'm really happy with
a lip liner but let's put this stuff on
that is what candy cane looks like and I
really like it it's like a darker Mavi
pink it's definitely the Pinker side but
I'm actually into it so I'm excited to
see if it's going to last throughout
this entire video next up we've got
cocoa K which is the lightest shade that
I purchased all these lip glosses also
smell really good they smell like
cupcakes it's basically a lighter
version of what I'm wearing on my lips
right now but definitely more of a pinky
shade as well that's fine I'm cool with
it
I also purchased exposed too which I
believe this Kylie's favorite I feel
like I always
having exposed and saying how much she
loves it but she claims that this is the
perfect nude it definitely reminds me of
the literally lip gloss it's very peachy
but cute yes I like it wow this is like
the worst first impressions video ever
because I'm literally just sitting here
being like yeah I like it
cool Dulce K I'm excited for these
darker ones because dark lips are so
much fun holy crap okay the packaging is
a lot darker than the product itself so
it's not as dark as I thought it was
going to be but we'll see oh yes okay I
like this one this one definitely has
more of like a topi color to it
definitely darker but it's still kind of
within the nude family true brown kay
let's try it out once again the
packaging is a little darker than the
product maybe not no this one's really
dark I really really like that it is the
perfect chocolate brown and I think
Brown lips is such an interesting
concept I feel like it's not as common
as other darker lip colors like dark red
and purples so Brown is a really cool
color I'm excited for that as far as how
the product feels on my lips right now I
don't feel it and when I put my lips
together it doesn't feel sticky like my
lips aren't sticking to each other so it
has kind of like a powdery finish to it
and I am actually super super pleased I
definitely think that this is one of
those products that you can't go
overboard with meaning if you're gonna
be using one of the liquid lipsticks
just use one side of the DOE foot
applicator and just use it all around
your lips because I feel like if you
take on too much product that's when it
starts getting patchy I've learned that
they're using so many different brands
of liquid lipsticks so less is
definitely more yeah I'm really excited
for those of you guys who have any of
these coming down below what your
favorite shade is because I did not
purchase all of them but I'm really
happy with these and just in general I
want to hear what you guys think yeah I
will definitely update you guys on my
thoughts on these products because
obviously the first impression was
pretty damn good so I hope you guys
enjoy today's video
