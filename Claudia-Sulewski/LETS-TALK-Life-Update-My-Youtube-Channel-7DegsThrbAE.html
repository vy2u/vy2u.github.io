video gosh Wow
so weird to be having this conversation
of you guys is like Oh whole hockey roll
what is up you guys welcome back to my
channel if my voice sounds a little low
I just came back from Coachella so sound
laughable a little bit today's video is
going to be a little different
I would wanted to make this video for a
very long time it's been on my mind for
a while and I feel like I'm finally at a
place where I have a very clear head
about it and yeah I just want to start
you guys and keep it casual it is
literally 9:00 p.m. right now
but I'm actually so tired I feel like
it's midnight also this makeup is like
10 hours old I feel like this is one of
those videos that I would normally try
to film so many times and get if I like
the fifth time but this is the first
time I'm doing it I'm going to try to
keep it that way because oh my god
trying to make things perfect and well
no we're here the cameras rolling let's
do it yeah okay
I have so much that I just want to spill
out to you guys so I guess for starters
I really want to make just a sit down
casual video just talking to you guys
because I feel like I although I make a
lot of sit down videos on this channel
you know normally I'm talking about
makeup products and materialistic things
not that that's a bad thing by any means
but you know this is a lifestyle channel
and so I feel like I rarely get to sit
down with you guys and just chat and
just catch up and just be straight up I
do that a lot on my vlog Channel and so
I feel like any of you guys who watched
my vlog channel will kind of watch this
and be like ya know I kind of like
understand this whatever but for those
of you who don't even watch those videos
then yeah maybe this is honestly the
first time you like really really get to
kind of discover a sliver of Who I am as
a person it can be hard to show your
personality through such curated videos
that are in specific categories and like
the ones that I make I'm not offended if
you don't want to watch this totally
fine but for those of you who stick
around and want to hear me out and have
just been watching my videos for a while
then I would really really appreciate if
you could watch this through and I don't
know I just like I want you guys to be
on the same page with me because I've
been a while since I've made like a
video like this basically over the past
um well I mean honestly ever since I've
moved out to LA I've seen a gradual
increase in comments from a lot of you
guys being disappointed in the content
that I'm creating on this channel which
I totally understand I see it I totally
see it and so I kind of want to give you
guys my perspective on it and where I'm
at in life and where I think it's going
to continue and all that stuff whoa that
is so weird like stepping outside of
this this is a really crazy video to be
making because whoa I don't know I mean
I'm not going anywhere but it just hold
okay I'm gonna keep talking and also I'm
sorry I swear a lot but like I'm really
not trying to have any filter tonight
and I as a person square up done so much
so much I'm gonna try to bleep it out
but like okay
I say should all discrepant sorry guys
anyways I'm not trying to sit here and
defend myself in any way or really
target any hate comments I've been
having this isn't not trying to make
this like a responding to hate type of
video because actually this is a really
exciting video I'm so excited to like
just kind of let you guys in on what my
life has been like in stuff but one
comment that kind of has really been
affecting me and then I've been seeing a
lot more especially over the last I
would say half year so the past six
months I basically had a bunch of you
guys commenting and messaging me saying
I am so disappointed to see that you
have become one of those youtubers who
move out to LA for YouTube and then slow
down your YouTube videos and don't make
as cool content as you used to when you
move back home please move back home I
hate your videos when you live out in LA
well what kind of that general type of
comment I kind of want to talk about
that for starters I feel like I've
always been pretty clear with this but
you can only repeat yourself so many
times but the reason why I moved out to
LA was not for my youtube channel it was
because of my youtube channel 100%
because you know my manager and my
network and all my YouTube friends were
out here and all the opportunities out
here and stuff and so I did move here
because of YouTube's 100% you guys got
me here and I
I love you guys for that like I have so
much gratitude and love for you guys
it's insane I think about you guys on
the daily but I did not move out here to
continue my personal work on this
channel obviously I continue with it
because this is my biggest platform and
it's a great way of expressing myself
and I've been doing this for so long so
it feels so weird to stop and I just
didn't want to and so I didn't stop I'm
still making videos I've been making
videos first over seven years now but
the reason I moved out to LA is to
figure out what my next thing is because
at the end of the day I know I
personally don't want YouTube to be my
forever and that doesn't mean that I'm
not going to be posting videos forever I
think down the line down the line I can
see myself vlogging more than like
sitting in front of camera and being
like this is a very good product of the
month I I really enjoy being able to
share my life and capture memories that
not only you guys get to see but also I
get to see when I'm older I love
vlogging so much it brings me so much
joy and that's why I do it it's on I'm
not trying to become a daily vlogger
because I cannot do that but I love
blogging my life and showing it to you
guys the reason why I moved out to LA is
to figure out what my next is I just
personally know that I am the type of
person that cannot just choose one task
and one challenge and be comfortable in
that zone and just carry that on for the
rest of my life so in 2014 moving out to
LA I was this little fish in this big
pond all these youtubers and I was super
exciting and I was making videos then I
really started to buckle down and I was
like okay I need to figure out what I
want to do next because I'm young right
now and all these cool opportunities are
coming my way but I want to get my ducks
in a row that's right that's the term
and start working super hard so that I
can save my ass in the future and create
a career out of this not that you can't
create a career on YouTube because
obviously so many people have but I
personally know as a human being I just
have the want to take on other things
and challenge myself in different ways
so when I first moved out here I got
very into hosting as you guys know I
started doing hosting with awesome TV
then I signed with Teen Vogue and became
Teen Vogue's first ever YouTube host
which was the coolest and greatest honor
ever I abso
we love my team's own family yeah it was
so much fun covering red carpets and
having the adrenaline of just meeting
people for the first time and talking to
them on camera and you know guiding
through this kind of improv Z but
natural but scripted conversation and it
was kind of my first taste of like whoa
I am still doing the same thing but I'm
a little outside of my comfort zone and
I kind of like it and so I was kind of
in that zone that contract lasts a year
long and towards the end of that
contract I kind of had a moment to
myself where I realized this was such a
great opportunity I learned so much
about myself and how I kind of worked in
front of different cameras in different
situations with different people blah
blah blah but I realized that hosting
didn't really challenge me I guess as
much as it did when I first started or
it wasn't really challenging me in the
ways that I wanted to be if that makes
sense
I don't the target site was a perfect
hosting was this thing that I became so
like nervous about and I like to chase
off the things that make me nervous
because it kind of shows me personally
that if I'm nervous about something it
means that I'm excited and that I care
about the outcome and everything leading
up to it right and so here's where
acting comes into play obviously you
guys see that I'm pretty deep into
acting now and it is the greatest
freaking thing in my life right now it
is bringing you so much joy and I love
it so so so much I'm going to talk about
it a little bit but basically it's going
back to the timelines story that I'm
telling you guys towards the end of my
little hosting adventure when we take a
sip of coffee real quick I basically sat
with my manager at the time and I was
like okay acting has always been
something that I've been interested in
I've always been fascinated by it and
I've always you know been curious about
it but it for some reason always felt
like this unattainable intimidating
thing that I just never thought I can
get to because I didn't necessarily grow
up in that sort of environment there was
always a part of me that wanted to try
out plays in high school but I was
already on the tennis team which called
for a lot of my out-of-school time and
by then I was already full-blown being a
youtuber because I started back in
seventh grade and so I never got to do
that and then moving out shortly after
switching over to online school being a
teen
being out here starting that there was
no time period for me to really take any
acting classes or whatever and so
anyways you know it always like felt
like one of those things that I just
thought maybe like weren't in the cars
um and towards the end of all that
hosting and that kind of year I had a
realization that at the end of the day
we are all human right and we are
capable of so much more than we believed
to be because for any of you have who
have seen like my deeper videos where I
talk about happiness and love age and
all that stuff you guys know I'm so into
your thoughts becoming your reality and
you know how much of everything that's
out here is you know also rooted and it
starts from within you and so I had this
realization of like oh my god if someone
had told me ten years ago that I was
going to be hosting on like red carpets
for Teen Vogue I would have screened him
in like no no no I'm not your girl milk
not going to do that and then I did it I
kind of thought to myself like well if
there's something inside of me that
really wants to do it like let's just
freakin do it I mean I kind of just
jumped in the water headfirst for the
hosting why don't I try that with acting
and so I hit up my manager at the time
and I was like I don't know how this
works
I don't have a lot of experience but
this is something that like I really
been itching to do can you just throw me
into auditions as you guys know tagged
the show that I am on that was like my
second audition I think and somehow the
casting director saw something in me
which is awesome
I feel like watching season one for me
is like painful because obviously I'm
just so hard on myself and I'm such a
critic anyways
filming has kind of started this whole
new era of my life this phase that I'm
currently still in and that I'm still
growing through and experiencing I just
realized how much I freaking love being
on set and telling a story through a
different voice in a different world
with different characters under
different circumstances the whole idea
of it is just like so freaking cool to
me I just respect the art of acting so
much I think it takes so much energy and
so much focus and focus on like being
present and peppery
and I'm just fascinated by all of it and
all the people that all come together
every single day for 12 hours working
towards the same goal I think it's just
so freakin cool
and so straight after tax season one I
definitely was bit with the acting bug
for sure I came back being like oh my
god let's freakin do this let's go on
auditions let's do about a thing better
boom everything kind of started to fall
into place right so post another show
with hosta miss called the commute if
you guys have seen nice the most darling
show ever with Stefan Argus we actually
wrapped season two a few weeks ago and I
am so so incredibly proud and so excited
for you guys to see it I've like Loki
been like just completely bugging the
director Becca I mean we're like best
friends now but she's been showing me
little pink peeks and all that stuff and
this is kind of the first project where
I'm like whoa okay I'm really excited
for the world to see this
so yeah that's great and like oh my god
tomorrow I'm going to miss screening for
tag season 2 and I'm so excited to see
the first three episodes and so yeah
okay basically sorry I'm getting on like
random tangent anyways once I started
kind of you know getting into acting
things started to kind of snowball I
signed with an agent I continued to go
on so many auditions and you guys don't
know how the audition process works
since I kind of jumped into this I would
take every audition very seriously and
memorize every single line and practice
it a bunch I've annoyed my roommates so
many damn times by being like hang in
drew can you read these signs with me
and then just freaking out the day of
the audition all this stuff it just
takes so much out of you and so anyways
everything starts to continue and I'm
kind of at a point right now where the
whole acting thing is really really
starting to happen and it's a little
scary because through all of this my
youtube channel has definitely suffered
and it's definitely bruised up and been
affected by this whole thing and so that
is kind of why I want to make this video
and just talk about where I'm at with
you guys as far as this channel because
it's so painful for me to read comments
being like you just become one of those
youtubers who don't care and don't put
the same quality in there
and I miss the old you and all this
stuff I kind of just want to get you
guys on the same page basically I
started making YouTube videos to give
the creative muscle in my brain
something to do something to work on
right I was living in a small town near
Chicago and I had a shitload of free
time and so many different ideas for so
many random things and YouTube was the
first thing that was kind of like oh
let's try this out and I hopped on board
and I started doing it and I fell in
love with it and I created so many cool
ass videos that I'm so proud of all the
different look books and whatever and I
just love sitting at nighttime until
like 6:00 a.m. like literally editing
and putting so much time into one title
slide and having all this move and
like cool everything I loved it I loved
it so much and a lot of you guys love
those videos too and you bring it up in
your life and do where are where is that
cool content all you're making nowadays
are like half-ass sit-down videos and
you can use all cool video it sucks it
definitely sucks to know that that kind
of shift or change has happened but you
guys like I'm human at the end of the
day I've been doing this for seven years
and kind of the same way how I felt was
hosting what I think about YouTube I
know that I have the capability to like
make something very cool because I love
to edit and I love planning out videos
and choosing the music and color
correcting and everything and I know I
can do that stuff and so I think I just
reached a point in my life where I have
found kind of this new outlet that
requires so much time and so much energy
and so much mental brainpower and focus
and I am just so happy doing it and it
sucks because oh there's there's this
YouTube channel that I have just
nurtured for seven years and I've loved
and put so much effort into and hours
and creativity and all that stuff but at
the end of the day like I'm the type of
person where if I were to just stay in
this comfort
and continue to do this I would drive
myself insane I would completely go
crazy for me personally a lot of my
youtube videos I actually just make
alone like I hate asking people to help
me film I usually try to do tripod stuff
and then I just sit on my desk and I
edit and all that stuff and so it's it's
kind of like a very lengthy tedious kind
of lonely process and like a lot of
youtubers could agree with that you know
you're spending so many hours by
yourself editing and planning and
filming and lighting up and all that
stuff and it's a lonely process and I
think maybe because I jumped straight
into work versus going to college I kind
of lost like that little chunk of my
early 20s kind of you know starting to
get into adulthood whatever I kind of
lost that little phase of like going to
college and still being in that kind of
social pool of people where you're
surrounded by people who are not only
your friends but also peers and teachers
of whom you know all ages and all this
stuff and when I started acting it kind
of opened up this whole new aspect to my
life where I am interacting with people
of all ages and all backgrounds and I'm
learning so much and I'm making so many
friendships and I'm learning so much
about myself and while doing all of that
I'm also working on something that is
challenging me in a way that I've never
been challenged and so it's fascinating
and I love it you know if there's like a
random week October um if there's like a
month where I don't post videos which
kind of basically happened last month
because I disappeared for three weeks
shooting missed news but if I miss a few
weeks or if my video just seems kind of
like rushed and simple and whatever it's
never because I'm lazy I never want you
guys to think that because I'm a
perfectionist with my work and trust me
like my management knows how frustrated
I get and how stressed out I get trying
to balance having an online presence and
this online brand and making sure I'm
keeping up with Instagram and all these
platforms so that also trying to be
taken seriously and this will acting in
this tree that I'm getting into and that
is still foreign and going auditions and
filming but then also trying to have
somewhat of a social life and that is
just like a whole other thing I
don't see anyone besides my roommates
besides like on the weekends so juggling
all of that is essentially what affected
my youtube channel and so I never want
you guys to think that it's out of
laziness because every single day I wake
up and I bake my freaking bed except for
today because I mean it's kind of made
but I was going to rush um but every
single morning I get up and I have a
to-do list and I have things to do and I
know I don't have to defend myself but I
think it's just really I thought it
sometimes just hurts reading comments of
some of you guys being like oh my gosh
what are you doing with your time you're
so lazy blah blah blah like you've
disappointed me so much over the past
year I know that I don't necessarily
need to make all of you guys happy at
the end of the day I just have to do
what makes me happy because this is my
life and every day the things that I'm
doing it's all leading to who I'm going
to become and you know the just whatever
and you guys know I'm sure at this point
a lot of you guys are thinking well
Claudia if you know you're so busy with
all this other stuff that you're going
on why even bother uploading videos that
you know aren't as cool as your old ones
and stuff like that and so I really
wanted to make a strong point of like
how much I still enjoy talking to you
guys and how much I enjoy reading your
comments and continuing this
relationship because at the end of the
day when I'm creating this stuff
obviously I'm so excited for like my
friends and family to see it but I'm
always constantly thinking about what
you guys are going to think about it or
while assuming on the set of commute I
wanted to vlog so badly to be able to
show you guys behind the scenes kind of
video a compilation of what's been going
on
because I guess growing up in front of
the camera I subconsciously just have
this part of me that's like oh my god
this is happening I want to share it
with everyone so I'm going to pull out a
vlog camera or pull out a snapchat or
whatever and share it with you guys this
is not a video of me being like alright
goodbye YouTube channel not at all like
I still there's still a very very huge
part of me that loves making haul videos
and favorites videos and random q and
A's I've started a slumber series this
year which honestly I did because I just
wanted an excuse to collab with more
people I've always been the type of
youtuber that just like never collabs
with you too
other youtubers and this is kind of a
series that forces me to film with other
youtubers and just create you know cool
fun little quirky content and so I still
love all of that I definitely do but I
think I just fell into this like really
scared phase of the youtubers always
having the pressure of uploading every
single week and having it be a really
good video that's going to get the same
amount of views as all the other videos
and all this stuff and you just kind of
fall into this like oh my god I'm like
so overwhelmed with this entire week but
I still have to upload a video and blah
blah blah and like I'm not going to try
to slow down with videos or anything but
I just really wanted to sit down with
you guys this week and just real and be
like yo if there's a lot happening but I
still care for you guys just as much as
I did in the beginning and I just don't
want you guys to think that I don't care
about you and that I don't care about
this channel just because I've had to
cut back on the hours that I'm mentally
able to work on my YouTube and the
amount of energy I'm allowed to put in
because at the end of the day like I'm
chasing after something that makes me so
happy and I can tell like I want to put
in my hours for this because this is
what I want to do when I'm like 35 25 40
whatever I just love it I really do
Saturday night I was laying in bed with
Rebecca one of my best friends and we're
laying in bed and just kind of talking
about you know what we think the meaning
of life is and like where we think our
soul go after death if there's a Hell in
a heaven or if there's a higher power
and recite all about that and then it
also kind of led to YouTube and all this
stuff and I was reading the comments on
a few of my videos and stuff and I
started kind of getting upset and then I
had this realization of like oh my god I
just need to talk to these people and
I'll state them as to why like things
are changing and that I'm human and I'm
growing up and I would never ever wish
for someone to just stay in the same the
past their entire life I you know like I
think I think as a human you should go
through different challenges in
different things and just that's
personally how I kind of view life I
think you should experience as much as
you can and meet as many people as you
can and
learn as many lessons as you can and the
whole idea of like being uncomfortable
and challenging yourself and to robbing
and kicking down all those walls of
self-doubt and not feeling like you can
do something you're not capable of it
when at the end of the day like we all
have hands we all brains we all have
everything I am so so happy and blessed
that I was born healthy and that I grew
up in a very safe lifestyle and I you
know been able to fall into this
beautiful life where I have the freedom
to be able to really take control of my
life and I guess that's just what I'm
doing I'm growing up and I'm figuring it
out and it's kind of cool to bring you
guys along but of course it totally
makes sense why so many of you guys are
like bitch where have you been what are
you doing hello don't forget about us
and I don't I haven't forgotten about
you guys oh my god
like you got I think about it all the
freaking time it sucks that half the
time it's more uni just being stressed
like oh my god I haven't uploaded all
look booking so long but it's just I'm
just putting my creativity into other
things Rebecca and I kind of had that
conversation and that's kind of what
just like set me and I was basically
just rambling about all this stuff and
just being like oh my god I just need to
get this off my chest I need to talk
about it and then this is like totally
random but also I read comments of
people feeling like I've changed on my
Instagram being like oh my god she's
trying so hard to be like an Instagram
model body whatever like posting photos
of herself and like oh I totally fall
into the habit of feeling like I just
need to defend myself and just like no
we movie but like yes I share my life
with you guys on Instagram and I'm
constantly posting on like snapchat and
all that stuff but you know there's a
sense of branding yourself and posting
the right type of content that will keep
the general larger audience engaged and
continue to grow and all that stuff
because I'm in the business where
numbers are a thing like sucks to say
that I hate it I like hate feeling like
I need to post a bunch of photos
riccelli weekend make sure my outfits
are fire and all that stuff like it's so
exhausting it's at the end of the day oh
my god like I never ever in a million
years whatever
is this weird sort of pressure on anyone
and I know that I'm very small tiny
little speck in like you know compared
to the broader sense of like Fame and
all that stuff like I'm a title or
whatever but to have that little taste
of this weird pressure to get strong
it's really weird it's really not normal
but with the type of interest that I
have like this kind of stuff comes along
but at the end of day it's also
incredible because you guys fort like I
mean this is just like the tiny
percentage to that you know I get Hayden
South most of you guys are the greatest
people ever you guys say the sweetest
things and you always make my day and
you kind of always round me and help me
realize like how crazy this life is
because it's not normal it's weird I
have no idea what kind of feedback this
video is going to get but also I've kind
of reached a point where I am just ready
to just not give at all I just want to
remind you guys that like I'm very aware
of everything done posting and
everything that you guys might be
feeling and like the last last thing I
ever want to do is like place any
negativity in your life I never like
want to disappoint you guys or make you
feel not cared or cheated on I don't
even know I don't even know what the
words I'm trying to say but we're all on
our own individual paths and like I
selfishly just want to do what makes me
happiest and that is just how I've
always wanted to follow my life and make
the decisions that I do I just run after
