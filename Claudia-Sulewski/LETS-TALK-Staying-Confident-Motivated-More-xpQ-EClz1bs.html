wanted to turn on the camera and spill
out two guys no idea what I'm going to
talk about no plan nothing
I feel stoppable No Limits it's
interesting because I feel like my
perspective on YouTube is really
starting to change especially within the
last I would say half year I've been
doing this for so long coming up on
seven years so I've gone through so many
different phases of creating videos like
this and doing this and having this goal
and stuff like that and I feel like
where I'm at right now my youtube
channel is the growth of my channel and
wanting to reach more viewers and all
that stuff isn't really a priority for
me I think the biggest thing that I want
to focus on is just continuing the
connection and relationship that I
already have with the people on here I
feel like every single day I'm gaining
some sort of knowledge whether it's a
self-reflection and it's something that
comes in from here or if it's something
that I hear and my brain just sets it up
and I start applying that to my life
it's growing up is cool essentially is
what I'm trying to say I guess just to
update you guys I know I didn't film a
video last week which pained me because
I hate missing weeks and we all know I'm
not the greatest I'm uploading exactly
on the same day every single week if
anyone knows that it's me I'm guilty but
I'm currently in the process of filming
season two of tagged and I'm personally
really excited because my character as
you saw was kind of a smaller part and
really have too many scenes and stuff in
the first season but in the second one
she definitely kind of has her own arc
and we've been filming really intense
scenes that are so much fun to dive into
and just place myself in that position
it's cool it's cool so yeah that's been
going on and I've been going on a ton
more auditions and a lot of stuff are
taking up more of my time and just
brainpower I think with all of this
stuff going on a lot of you guys asked
me Claudia what are you going to stop
making YouTube videos or
you know I can tell you've slowed down
or Baba and I don't think I'm perfect
and I know that my channel will not stay
the way that it has been for years and
years I think the beautiful part of how
my life is starting to lay out because
I'm working on so many other things that
are starting to bump up on my priority
list YouTube is kind of becoming a hobby
for me again even just filming right now
right this second it's giving me the
same feeling that I used to get in my
light blue bedroom eighth grade filming
for the hell of it it feels very homey
to me I don't know what it's like to not
make youtube videos because I've been
doing it for so long
I always keep you guys updated on
everything across Twitter Instagram
snapchat YouTube all that stuff and so
if I'm ever going anywhere you guys are
going to know where I'm going but I'm so
chillin here YouTube will forever be
such a huge part of just me in general
but I tweeted you guys saying that you
could ask me questions or bring up any
topic so you want me to talk about so I
didn't necessarily want to make this a
QA but I really do love hearing what you
guys have to say and what questions you
have so I did screenshot some describe
the YouTube life every aspect of it the
good and the bad the best thing about it
is definitely the creative freedom
everything that I'm posting online is
100% me the idea starts in here and then
it travels through here and here and
then here if that made any sense I think
the worst part about it is the weird
pressure that people start kind of
putting onto you I'm constantly reading
comments and tweets about people saying
why don't you make videos like this or
why aren't your videos the way that they
used to be your you should do this and
so that and then you somehow get put
onto this pedestal of this role model
figure where everything that you're
posting and saying is going to affect a
lot of people that you've never even met
before I've said this before in a video
but when I first started YouTube I
didn't sign up to become a role model I
just wanted to find an outlet to make
cool and just express myself so
yeah the pressure is really weird it's
weird to have that kind of always
sitting
on you every single time I open up any
app on here and say anything or post
anything thanks Fred with the way that
I've come to think around that and be
able to cope with that is just reminding
myself why I do what I do and realizing
that the only reason I should be doing
it is for myself I tweeted this this
morning and a lot of you guys were like
oh yeah girl new life motto but I
tweeted quickly realizing my biggest
role model is my future self she's the
one I want to make proud she's the one
that I don't want to let down within the
past three months specifically three
months I mean it's a gradual thing but
I've really intensely started to take
notice on all of my intentions with
everything that I do this kind of starts
to play into confidence which is why I
want to bring it up because a lot of you
guys always ask but I realized the only
way that I can stay confident is if I do
things that I know my future self will
be proud of and will be thankful for and
of course this goes up and down multiple
times a week there are days where I feel
extremely confident and that I have all
my together and I know exactly what
I want in this life and then there are
days where I just completely flips and I
doubt every single thing that I'm doing
and even the things that I'm saying it's
kind of crazy to think that your mental
health affects every single aspect of
your life so much every single day
walking into a room full of people that
you're about to interact with can play
out so differently depending on how you
walk into that room whether you feel
confident knowing that you're about to
engage in awesome conversations and make
memories or you feel insecure walking
into that room and doubtful with what
you're gonna say it's it's crazy also
something else that I wanted to bring up
still kind of going with the confidence
thing especially starting in my teen
years I remember growing up always
having and this still happens to me
today I'm girl
but I've always been stuck on this idea
or I guess this vision of what I think
future Claudia will be like look like
act like and always assuming that I'll
get to that place because that's where I
wanted to go okay okay
I've always had love I boys I can't talk
I've always had this problem with
putting too much trust into time and the
future and just thinking that I'm gonna
get to that spot and I'm gonna be that
person and then if you once go by and
I'm not as fit as I want it to be or I'm
not doing what I want to be doing this
has always just been like a thing that
I'm always thinking of oh I'll get there
in a few months or a year from now like
I'm gonna look like this I forgot what
sparked this and when exactly I started
to do this but one night I remember just
thinking about this and admitting and
admitting to myself that I need to stop
doing that and I need to stop just
relying on the future and just
temporarily convincing myself that I
will get there and I will be that way so
one of my biggest motivations is taking
that idea of who I want to be and asking
myself what are the habits of that
person the second that question ran
through my mind I was able to come up
with so many answers of things that
weren't habits in my life and things
that I wasn't doing yet this is a super
casual and simple one but one of the
first things that I thought of was oh
well this girl that I want to be she
makes her bed every single morning and
now months later I can confidently say I
make my bed every single morning it is
the first thing that I do every single
day after I wake up so I don't know if
this is gonna resonate with any of you
guys but I love doing that I love
sitting down and asking myself what
habits does this person that I want to
be half ingrained in them what do they
do every single day what's going through
their head I'm now eating healthy and
working out multiple times a week
because I know that the person that I
want to become does that and I think
it'd be so foolish if I knew exactly
what I want to be doing but not actually
doing it your time is so so available
and so precious
and at the end of the day you just have
to make it your best friend every single
day we're given the opportunity to use
the time that we have to move ourselves
forward and this doesn't even have to be
career based I'm just constantly basing
it off of that because it is the number
one focus in my life right now but that
goes with even just all of your
relationships in life spend your time
with the people that you think deserve
it most and make you want to be a better
person and make you happier I personally
know I don't have all the answers to
life and what happens after death and
all that stuff but I do know that I have
this right now this time to take it in
any direction that I want and I think
that's kind of been my biggest
motivation lately
damn this is getting so much deeper than
I thought it would I hear here I was
sitting down thinking it'd be a casual
video talking about some silly story
that happened to me or something but no
we we're getting into it I'm gonna go on
Twitter and see if there are any other
things that I want to talk about even
though this video is are you going to be
so freaking long I did I just wrote a
question and I just laughed at my answer
because it's so cheesy but I'll say it
whatever um what's your favorite thing
about life and why I think falling in
love and I mean more than just falling
in love with a human being because
mentally I do not have time for that
right now but I think with anything
falling in love with friends falling in
love with new food new experiences and
habits places
music freaking new colors I don't know
having love for something is such a
fulfilling emotion I love love it's so
lovely everything that I want to talk
about or is popping up in my mind I so
damn cheesy oh my god I'm such a
cheeseball with you guys the next thing
that I wanted to bring up was how much I
love my home um let me explain why I
here we are we're getting into it the
relationship that I have with my mom and
I feel like maybe some of you guys can
relate with me is uh she kind of feels
more like a sister or best friend to me
rather than an actual mom and I think
it's because she just has a very
youthful soul because of that we are so
close we tell each other everything but
also because of that we bump heads like
crazy
my mom's gonna hate me for bringing this
up on the Internet
but when I still lived at home and a
little after moving out here our
relationship became so intense and we
would fight so much more often than not
fight it became really stressful and I
had times where I blocked number and
we'd not talk to each other and then we
would somehow link up again and share
everything and then it was a weird cycle
I think the reason why I'm in such a
good place my mom and amazing place my
mom is because my I'm becoming an adult
and I know everything that there is to
know
ego it has finally dropped and I'm now
starting to understand the things that
my mom would say and where my parents
were coming from when they would give me
certain advice and I would just kind of
shut it out thinking that I know the
right answer and all that stuff when in
reality they have lived on this earth
for so much longer than this 20 year old
so they're gonna know a handful of
things that I have yet to experience and
truly realizing that I've gained so much
respect for both of my parents and it's
so great I find myself facetiming my mom
and calling her more than she does which
was never a thing and nowadays anytime I
do something or find out something
exciting she's the first person that I'm
calling so it's really interesting to
see all of that shift so greatly in such
a short amount of time
I remember my oldest brother Marcin
going through the same thing where he
felt super rebellious and would
constantly Butthead with my parents and
I remember one time sitting down talking
with him and he was telling me exactly
what I'm telling you guys and I just
remember thinking no no I will never
have that mindset and now here I am with
that mindset what am I even talking
about this I don't know I guess it's
just a relevant thing in my life right
now where my relationship with my
parents has just strengthened so much
and it's become so much deeper it's cool
I just want to pry out every single
thing that's going in their heads and
just listen to them talk I think another
piece of advice that really stood out to
me and has helped me get to this place
with my family my parents especially is
no matter what's going on around you
what happens to you you are 100%
responsible for how you react to it
I never the first time that hit me I was
like whoa that is so true because I can
think of so many conversations that I've
had with my mom where she'll say
something and it'll trigger something
inside of me to just start reacting and
fighting and it never ends well it
always ends with someone hanging up on
the other person or someone walking out
of the room and this goes with any
relationship that you have or anything
that's going on in your life but if
something is happening or you're hearing
something that you know would normally
upset you make you sad make you angry
whatever it may be it is so easy to flip
that situation just by how you initially
react to it I kind of think that's the
secret to never getting into fights with
anyone as we all know adding fuel to the
fire will never ever ever work out in
anyone's favor yeah I've never really
been the type to ever get into fights
with anyone it's kind of weird how
little drama I have going on at all
times
but yeah growing up the person that I
fought with most well the only person
was my mom but it doesn't happen anymore
and that is such an awesome thing to be
able to say and realize I don't know
what the purpose of this video was um at
least personally it felt really good to
get all of that out and maybe it'll feel
just as good for some of you guys to
hear it sorry
thumbs up this video if you guys enjoyed
it and go call your parents and tell
them how much you love them and how
grateful you are for them I love you
guys so much and for those of you who
stuck through this I love you more
because I don't know if I could sit
through this entire video I will see you
guys for a new one very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
