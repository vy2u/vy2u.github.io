polish to use as the sand and you're
just going to apply this all over your
nails
so once your nails have completely dried
you're gonna grab a white striper and
I'm just using this one from Art Deco
and you're just gonna roughly sketch out
a guideline for the wave make sure that
every nail is different and unique so
that you have a little bit of variety
for the next step you're going to need a
sponge some sort of surface to put your
nail polish on and a white nail polish
so I'm just gonna put some of the white
nail polish onto my little plate and
dipping the sponge in there I'm just
gonna start heading it on the nail and
following the guide line that we drew
don't forget to fill in on the sides of
your nails as well so your nails should
look a little something like this for
the next step you're gonna need a blue
nail polish and mine was a little bit
too dark so I just mixed it in with some
of my white nail polish now just using
the same technique I'm gonna be padding
on the blue nail polish but leaving a
little bit of the white at the bottom
still showing behind once your nails are
dry we're gonna start working on the
starfish like I did on the thumb so
you're just gonna grab any nail polish
of your choice I chose this coral one
and some sort of dotting tool if you
don't have one you can always just use
like a toothpick and you could just
start drawing your starfish I definitely
recommend Google imaging starfishes just
to kind of get a feel for what they look
like and find turned out a little bit
sloppy and a little bit bigger than I
hoped it would be but it doesn't have to
be perfect
so now I'm just going to be dipping a
q-tip into nail polish remover and
cleaning up the edges of my nails
once your nails are dry you can apply on
your favorite top coat and you're done I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and
I'll see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
