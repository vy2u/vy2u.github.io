hydrating treatment to use as a
moisturizer and primer for my face after
that I'm going in with my favorite
benefit foundation and setting that with
my makeup forever powder once I'm done
with that I'm just contouring my face
with my benefit hoola bronzer using my
Coastal Scents eyeshadow brush I'm
applying on a light nude to my the waves
and Tony Brown into my crease you
couldn't see Selena's I makeup in the
photos but since her lips were very dark
I kept my look very natural using the
Urban Decay 24/7 liquid eyeliner I'm
creating a very small wink on my upper
lash line that I'm going in it with my
favorite mascara at the moment and
applying it to my upper and lower lashes
for blush I'm using my Mac blush in the
shade at Desert Rose and just applying
that to the apples of my cheeks Mac's
lipstick and diva looked very similar to
Selena's so I'm just applying that onto
my lips Selena's lips also had a really
pretty shine to them so to add in that
moisture and shine to my lips I'm just
applying on it the buxom fall on lip
polish in the shade dolly Selena had her
hair pulled back in a high casual bun so
I'm just going to twist my hair and see
a ballerina bun
using as many bobby pins as you like
secure your bun in place after that I'm
pulling out my baby hair to pray my face
and mess up the look to ensure my
hairstyle will not fall out throughout
the day I am grabbing my style sexy hair
texturizing spray and just spraying it
everywhere now that we're done with the
makeup and hair it's time for the outfit
starting off with pants I found these
distressed boyfriend jeans from H&amp;amp;M I
also found a plain black t-shirt from
Charlotte Russe and a structured blazer
from H&amp;amp;M that's similar to Selena's I
purchased this navy blue purse from
Target which strangely looks pretty
similar to Selena's and for shoes I got
these plain simple heels from forever 21
now for the accessories I found all of
them from forever 21 including these
cata sunglasses a gold chain necklace
and gold hoop earrings
last but not least the nails I'm
starting out by painting all of my
fingers black except for the ring finger
because we're going to be adding an
accent color so I'm choosing the Soria
nail polish in and Eve with its high
pigmentation I only had to apply on two
coats of the nail polish and I think
this color really works well with the
bag from Target with the blue and purple
undertones in it to try out most of the
products featured in today's video be
