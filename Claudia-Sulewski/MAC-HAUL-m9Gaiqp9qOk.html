today's video I feel like I say that
every single video but I do have two
things to mention the first one is I'm
sorry if you could hear my mom's music
she's playing it downstairs in the
kitchen and I don't know if the camera
will pick it up but if it does I'm sorry
about that
but also next week is finals week for me
and this is my first week of finals cuz
I'm a freshman and I'm going to be
studying a lot this week and also next
week so I just want to warn you guys
that I might not have as much time as I
usually have to film videos and stuff so
I don't know how many videos are gonna
come up with in this next two week
period but today I got a package in the
mail from Mac I ordered some stuff like
Friday they actually came really really
fast which was super awesome
it's not that big of a haul but it has a
couple things and you guys are probably
like oh my goodness a matte call this is
the first Mac haul that I'm filming so
this is like a historical moment right
now a couple days ago I ordered some
stuff online and I was just like you
know what like I really need to try out
some Mac products because I really not
tried that money okay so the first thing
that I got was a mineralized skinfinish
natural so it just looks like this and
mine is in medium plus I just color
matched it online but it looks like this
you swatch on your finger it has a
decent amount of coverage I don't know
I'm really excited to use this so next I
got one of their mineralized skinfinish
--is and I'm going to be using this one
as a highlight and this is in so it
looks like this and this is in soft and
gentle so when you open it up it looks
like this it's kind of I don't even know
it's definitely has gold in it but I
feel like it has pink in it too I don't
know but it's super pretty colored so as
you can see right there i swatched on my
ring finger sorry the lighting kind of
sucks
in today's video but yeah I'm really
excited to start using this
site about everything I'm probably gonna
end up saying that after every single
product so I got those two and then I
also got two blushes and the first one
is in peaches which is pretty
self-explanatory it's just a Gucci blush
so it looks like this there you go
so there is a swatch of it on my hand
right there I'm really excited to start
wearing that blush just because I think
it's the perfect kind of summertime
coral you know blush color so that's
gonna be really fun and then also I got
a blush and a prism which I don't know
if too many people talk about it I don't
really think so
so this blush is just a matte kind of
brownie pink color and I don't really
know why I was so attracted to this
color but I think it's so pretty I don't
know why but there's a swatch of it now
that's obviously a really really dark
swatch because I put a lot of product
into that but it's super blendable and
yeah I think it's gonna be really really
pretty
so the last four items are all lip
products so first I'm going to start out
with the lipsticks I got three lipsticks
kind of in more neutral nude pinky tones
so the first one is an angel and of
course I have to get this one obviously
this is the one that's known by kim
kardashian it's like her signature scent
or something but it looks like this and
it looks really dark in the camera but
it's more of just like a neutral kind of
everyday pink color
there's the swatch of it right there
yeah the lighting is so bad so I'm sorry
about that
but I think this color is going to be
super pretty the next one I got is in
myth and this one is pretty popular too
it's just like your basic everyday kind
of typical nude shade and I was really
excited for this one so it looks like
that and then for the swatch looks like
that so it looks kind of orange in this
camera but
so then the last lipstick I got is in
hue and this is known to be kind of like
your everyday kind of baby pink neutral
lipstick that looks really good on
everyone and it looks like this when you
open it up I love it I'm actually
wearing it right now with the lip gloss
that I got and for the swatch it is
right there so pretty it's actually kind
of sheer I like it a lot I can
definitely picture this becoming one of
my favorite like everyday lipsticks to
you know put in my backpack and use
every day for school so there's that
those are the three lipsticks that I got
so the last product I got was one of
their cream Sheen glasses and oh my
goodness I did not know that these were
so soft on your lips because I'm wearing
it right now with the hue lipstick and I
was like oh my goodness I finally
understand what everybody is like in
love with like Mac like oh my gosh I'm
just so excited but anyways so it looks
like this and it's just kind of like a
baby pink more darker that a baby pink
is just like a legit pink lip glass no
premium glass it's alright and this is
in the color right image so there you go
and oh my gosh it's so pretty
so there is a swatch and it is so soft
of your lips oh my gosh I cannot get
over how soft it is but that concludes
my Mac haul I hope you guys enjoyed it
and I'm totally gonna be buying more Mac
products I mean they are really really
expensive but yeah totally worth it
because so far from what I've tried
because I have tried a couple of these
the quality is really good and I'm
really impressed so that is it for
today's haul and I hope you guys enjoyed
it and that's it okay so I will talk to
you guys later in another video okay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
