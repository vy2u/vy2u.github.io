channel today's video is going to be a
beauty haul and you guys know that
whenever I incorporate fashion I usually
like to show you guys clips of me trying
on the clothes so you guys can see what
they look like and I don't know why I've
never thought to do that with beauty
products but we're gonna try that out
today everything that I'm gonna be
showing I've actually never tried before
so I'm either going to be testing it out
for the first time on camera with you
guys as well as overlays of what the
product actually looks like or how it's
used you guys feel me we're going with
it I've accumulated all these things
from Sephora aka my favorite and only
makeup store that I ever go to so you
could get all this stuff there or online
I'll have links down below all that good
stuff but yeah it's really exciting
because they are coming out with a lot
of new products and brands this spring
so I'm excited to try out this stuff and
show you guys what I got so for starters
I got two different products from my new
brand
the Estee edit which is exclusive at
Sephora we've got this lip gloss it is
their flash photo gloss and I thought
this was really interesting because it
actually contains cool blue micro pearls
that are supposed to enhance the
whiteness of your teeth I'm all about
whitening products and having a brighter
smile so the fact that I can do it by
putting something on my lips yeah that
catches my attention next up we've got
some makeup remover and I'm really
excited about this one because I'm
always using makeup wipes they're
convenient and I just I don't know I
always give in and I buy them but
they're not good for the environment
because you're wasting so much paper so
I'm really excited to try the dissolve
the drama
two-in-one makeup remover and cleanser
so basically what you're supposed to do
with this stuff is pour a little bit on
your hands kind of swirl it around a
little bit and start to massage it into
your face so really focus in on your
eyes kind of let it sink in and then
you're supposed to rinse it off with
water and it kind of turns milky and
while it's washing off all the makeup
it's kind of cleansing your face at the
same time so you can totally just use
this as your makeup removers slash
facial cleanser
the end of the day next up we've got in
eyes shadow palettes and this is by the
brand tarte it's a limited edition
palette it's called a rainforest of the
sea which is a new collection from tarts
that is exclusive to Sephora these
colors are so pretty I love the gold
purple is my favorite color when you
open it up you can see it kind of has a
real of colors and all of these shades
are super neutral to bounce it all out
they have a little bit of Sheen and
shimmer to them and oh wow oh yeah these
feels so velvety that is the word that I
would explain these with megusta mucho
okay
the next product that I want to show you
guys is very interesting it is the Derek
Lam ten Crosby collection so this is
what it looks like you're probably so
curious what's it inside if you're
Claudia just open it up okay I'm doing
it okay but when you open it up it looks
like this so basically you've got one
two three four five six seven eight nine
ten I could guess that ten different
fragrances I was reading a little bit
about the story behind these and for
starters on this card it says that each
scent was inspired by women captured in
a unique moment on Crosby Street I'm
gonna go through and find my favorite
one oh okay oh shoot oh wow this one is
good oh wow okay wow these all smells so
good
not that I'm thinking of it this would
actually make a really really good gift
for someone I would say my favorites
would have to be a tie between HiFi the
purple one or something wild
the next products that I'll be showing
you guys is actually a hair product I
don't know how to pronounce this brand I
think it's a why why mmm
not even close it's pronounced way it
smells oh you a I haircare and I've
actually never tried anything from them
before so I'm really excited so
basically it's a treatment mask for
really damaged hair and since I have
been starting to lighten and bleach my
hair
it's definitely lost its overall
healthiness basically you're just
whistle
for a few minutes I also saw on the
website you can put this into your hair
right before you go working out and
sweating a bunch and the heat is
supposed to help with the product
penetrate into your hair so that when
you shower your hair is like oh my gosh
I'm so smooth obviously haven't done it
yet but I want to do it a lot of people
are at our house right now hopefully can
hear them okay
the next product is for your eyes and it
is the milk makeup eye pigment and it
comes in this cute little squeezy tube
basically it's a cream eyeshadow that is
very very pigmented I personally have
the shade silent and disco I thought I
was getting more of a dark brown but
it's giving off a little bit of a purple
so so so pretty but yeah this stuff is
supposed to dry super quick and it's not
supposed to crease so you don't even
need to put anything on top you can just
wear this alone so that is a super fun
color next up we've got a lip product
and this is by the brand wander Beauty
I've never tried anything from them so
we shall see how this goes but this
product is super cool because it is a
dual ended lipstick so you get two
different colors and you can switch your
makeup look from daytime to nighttime if
you want I have the lipstick in Nikki
Beach the first shade you get is your
perfect kind of bright watermelon red
and then also you get like a rosy pink
color so super appropriate for the
springtime oh yeah super creamy this
next product I'm super excited about
partially because it's really fun to say
but it is the Brazilian bum bum cream I
love it ok so this is the packaging it's
super bright and orange it's by the
brand of sol de janeiro and basically it
is a body cream for your bumbum it says
it all in the title packaging incredible
love the matte finish of the lid but
basically it's supposed to help to
tighten and smooth the look of your skin
so you can totally apply this on like
the back of your legs and your thighs
and stuff like that wow wow this smells
so good it's straight up smells like a
pina colada right away I will say that
it's soaking and quick and it's not
leaving my skin feeling sticky for
anything like that super cute the next
product that I want to show you guys is
a little more intense but this one
sounds really cool so I want to talk
about it so it is the derma flash it's
basically in exfoliating facial
treatments having to put on a lot of
makeup for different shoots and things
like that you tend to build up a lot on
your face even just living your
day-to-day life and this product is
supposed to exfoliate your face from all
that stuff but it also takes away dead
skin cells and also removes the fuzzy
peach fuzz that you have on your face
let's open this puppy up
also you get two different products
you've got the first step which is
prepping your skin and then the last one
which is supposed to help smooth it and
in between you guys can see that you
have a tray of the tiny little very
gentle soft razors they put onto this
little wand looking thing and it's
supposed to help exploit your skin
who knew exploiting your skin could be
still fun I've got one last thing to
show you guys and it is a face serum you
guys know that I'm a huge fan with face
lotion I apply it on every morning every
night but I've never really gotten into
face serums I think they're just very
foreign for me so I always kind of
geared away from them but I am really
really excited to try this and see if it
makes a difference for my face
personally so this one is from cane and
why and it is there a refill and recover
serum skin serum with halo see it
naturally activates the collagen that
your skin already contains okay this
bottle is very cool just from pumping it
on my hand
I can feel that it's really light and I
think that's why I really want to try
and start using serums because sometimes
lotions just feel too thick and cakey on
your face while serums just kind of
glide right on amazing awesome that is
it for today's beauty haul thank you
guys so much for watching today's video
and also a huge thank you to Sephora
literally my favorite makeup brand ever
for collaborating with me to make this
video and allowing me to try out these
different products and stuff I was so
excited about this opportunity so thank
you so much and yeah I will see you guys
for a new video next week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
