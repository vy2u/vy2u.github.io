shoulders I'm so excited to be going
again ok today's video is going to be my
March favorites every single thing
mentioned in today's video has actually
never been talked about on my channel
before so get even more excited ok
my favorite accessory for the month is
definitely this backpack right here and
I actually got this for my 20th birthday
from my mom it's a Rebecca Minkoff
backpack with black leather and there's
a bunch of Fringe everywhere I can
either clip it down and wear the
backpack like this or what I like to do
is clip it up here and then it kind of
folds over so I thought that was really
unique touched and overall it is the
perfect size backpack it's so
comfortable great job mom
great birthday gift thank you so much
alright we've got a lot of products to
run through I'm going to start off with
a self-tanning product I'm not sure if
this is out yet if it is I will link it
down below but it is one of benefits
newest products it is the hoola zero
tanlines all-over body bronzer so it's
basically like a temporary self-tanning
gel the packaging of course is awesome
when you open it up it just pumps out
and the cool part is you actually have
an applicator on the lid pump the
product onto the sponge and blend it
onto my arms and legs or my neck
wherever I'm putting it and it looks so
good it smells super fresh it doesn't
have that self-tanner smell that most
lotions have next up I've been loving a
new face lotion this is the Clinique
dramatically different moisturizing
lotion and I have heard so many amazing
things about this product for so many
years and I finally decided to buy it
and I'm in love with it it is so so so
good I like to apply this on to my face
every morning and night after washing my
face and within using it for I would say
three days I dramatically literally
dramatically cuz it's in the title i
dramatically notice a difference in my
face my discoloration was going away my
act
is going away this has been a miracle
product for me so I highly recommend it
next up we've got some teeth whitening
products I don't know if any of you guys
can relate but I personally don't like
using Crest Whitestrips I do think it's
the most effective way to do it at home
but I hate how the strips have gotten
shorter so it doesn't go all the way to
your molars it just stays on the front
teeth but I do really really like the
crest 3d products so I decided to go
with this little combo right here we've
got the brilliance boost amplifying
polishing treatments you kind of use it
like a toothpaste after you brush your
teeth and then after that I like to use
their glamorous whites mouthwash and
rinse everything through I've always
loved this line I really do think it
helps whiten my teeth and I've just been
really enjoying those two my next
favorite is a makeup setting spray and
this is by the brand Boscia it's their
white charcoal mattifying makeup setting
spray this one just caught my eye in
Sephora and I've got to say I really
like it I love the smell of it it really
does help to mattify my face because I
tend to get greasy just good things to
say about it I love it okay guys I have
found the greatest hairspray in the
entire world
it is the Carlos daughter mono II
repairing flexible hold hairspray
I definitely butchered that but I'll
have a close-up on the label I need it
quickly it full-on smells like a body
mist that's the best way to describe it
it kind of smells like candy it's sweet
but it still has a refreshing smell
that's kind of what sold me honestly was
the smell of it but beyond that I like
the texture of my hair when I use it
it's got oils and vitamins I'm really
happy about this hairspray I've got one
last beauty product and this is a
coverage product a face product you guys
know how much I love the Make Up For
Ever Ultra HD foundation I've been using
it for over a year now and I don't plan
on changing it any time soon because I'm
so so how
with it but recently I got to test out a
different product from the same Ultra HD
line and this is their foundation stick
I personally am in the shade 125 Y 315 I
like to actually use this as a concealer
I'll go in with my finger and I'll just
dot around any spots that need to be
covered up and it erases them they are
gone they're off your face they flew off
I'm so so pleased with this product so
that's going in my everyday makeup
routine I've got a few random things to
show you guys the first one is
food-related
and it is a new product on the market I
who is so so excited to see this because
I've been wanting to try it out anyways
it's from Trader Joe's as you guys know
it's my favorite grocery store they
recently started selling rice
cauliflower in these little bags
first of all presentation amazing 10 out
of 10 taste 10 out of 10 I personally
like to stir-fry this with a bunch of
other veggies and I add in some sweet
chili sauce a little bit of soy sauce
kind of make like a fry rice type of
thing it's awesome I am all for finding
new healthy food obsessions and I highly
recommend it you can do so many things
with this my next favorites is a water
bottle and I got this online from Urban
Outfitters this sucker is so convenient
I love making infused waters with
different berries and fruits but I also
like making lemon water basically you
can cut a lemon in half squeeze it in
there if you want to take this out you
can but you can also just keep the lemon
on top close this off and continue to
you know have the lemon kind of soak in
to your water and it's awesome I love it
definitely recommend this water bottle
it's great water you need it I'm trying
to find my phone to see if I have any
music favorites I will link my Spotify
playlist down below if you guys want to
listen to my stuff but lately I have
been listening to my winter 16 playlist
yeah I think I mentioned this one last
time so I'm still listening to the same
playlist but I did find new music my
first favorite song is tremble by Nicole
Miller
like a boombox on my shoulders guys
blasting this song in the car is just a
whole nother experience New York City by
the chainsmokers my friend Kelly
um Lucy the tea's by Alan Raymond great
song
fantasy boys by Bronco

my music you can just once again check
