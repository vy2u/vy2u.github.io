similar people I would be so jealous of
you I don't hate you thing I've ever
heard in 90% probably I don't know like
were you like funny it was the one of
the funniest you're a funny person yes
yes cool I always was sitting in the
face oh you were yes yes and I was
talking to the teachers and I was like
that too
I wait for them you know that's why you
shattered and then when they was like
this yeah you couldn't cheat it's cool
how because they always go to notes what
you had cheat sheets yes
yeah dad like whatever no no the article
piece she never never what about like
the sex talk did you ever have that talk
with me
I don't know maybe it just gleams cuz I
remember dad trying to bring you up and
he was saying sex is a very beautiful
thing that two people experience and I
was like oh good you don't need to go
there reduce protection and be careful
but if you ever gonna have give it to me
I will show you this baby my mama takes
all the babies yeah it's not that you
have any questions for me did I ever
disappoint you if you have that thoughts
please let me know what's funny cuz like
when I was younger I used to like be
like a little embarrassed by having like
foreign parents I was just like oh my
god like my parents can't really like
speak English or like some different
than everyone
they're not like American parents our
families look so not normal and it's so
weird the older I get the more I realize
how different we are in like the best
way I've never met like a family that
like works like ours does so particular
that like when I come home it's like the
best feeling ever because I only feel
that way when I'm here yeah
and that was not pressure I think us as
a family have gone through like a lot of
shit at the end of the day like you gave
me Kevin Morrison such a good life
anything with bad just kind of like dims
away because I think the good ones are
so good you did the best you could is
another and you did a good job why did

knowledge oh you were so smart I should
hold
I should always have the camera around
