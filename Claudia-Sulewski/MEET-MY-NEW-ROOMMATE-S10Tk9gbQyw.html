little bit more chill and hanging out in
my PJs always will be today's video is
going to be a hashtag ask Claudia video
where I answer your guys's questions
from Twitter if you ever want to
participate in any of these videos all
you have to do is follow me on Twitter
which is at Claudia so loose key let's
get into the questions grapes
always last item you bought can you
throw me that bag I bought this
yesterday
it's a lovely dustpan set six dollars
good answer thanks for the downbar I
dare you to pray : Z and tell her you're
having a baby with her and she is the
mother what's your signature dance move
I feel like the mic dance it is kind of
like although I do know a Lindsay's a
signature dance move which is like what
does she do she goes like Oh pops it's
like this it's like this at Claudius
loose key who is your new roommate hi
introduce yourself hi I'm Lexi and Lexi
is also youtuber what is your YouTube
channel Lexi check out lexi lombard on
youtube.com the frame I'm like so you'd
like to number name you know and it's
pretty great get used to her face cuz
you're gonna be seeing a lot of it how
many children do you have and who is the
dad well I have three children at the
moment - Lexi Jack and drew I'm a driver
of the family sing-along favorite video
to film one of my favorite types of
videos to film what would probably have
to be look books especially when I'm
filming them like outside and just like
outside my room in house I actually just
recently filmed and uploaded a video
it's how to style a t-shirt dress it's a
fall lookbook I will leave it link down
below if you guys wanna check it out but
I had so much fun filming that video and
editing it was so much fun as well and
I'm just so happy with how it turned out
how many boyfriends do you have single
mom Topshop or brandy melville I would
probably have to say Topshop because
Topshop is my favorite store in the
entire wallet we're actually going there
today I completely forgot but I guess
they have a larger selection of like
different types of clothes so if you
want to get like company casual or fancy
dresses so I feel like Topshop is just
kind of more convenient where are your
parents from I get this asked a lot
because every time they're like in
videos or vlogs you guys notice they're
really heavy accent
and they are both from Poland and to
answer any other questions that you have
off of that yes I am 100% polish and I
fluently speak Polish
Avantika hum said a whole Paki e Yanni
of him
do you miss living at home surprisingly
I actually have not gotten homesick at
all while living here but I do miss
obviously my friends and family it was
really great seeing them like a week ago
when I visited for about three days but
overall like I haven't really gotten
homesick at all so I think everyone is
different about moving and I'm just one
of those people that just doesn't really
get homesick so those are all the
questions that I will be answering in
today's video thank you to everyone who
tweeted to me and hopefully I'll be able
to film one of these very soon because I
highly enjoy them thumbs up this video
if you guys want to see more of them and
I'll see you guys in a new video how I
just hit my chin very soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
