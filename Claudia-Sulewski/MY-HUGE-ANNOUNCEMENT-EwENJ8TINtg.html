a very huge and special announcement to
make i'm cheesing so hard right now

you guys this has been the works for
many months and i just wanted to tell
you guys the second i found out i had to
keep it in as a februari fifth it is
officially announce that i am the first
ever Teen Vogue youtube host oh my god I
cannot even express how excited I am
about this entire opportunity and how
grateful I am for you guys that I'll be
able to do things like this like what if
I knew that I was gonna be doing this in
just two years from now I would have not
believed it at all Teen Vogue has hands
down always been my favorite magazine so
the fact that i am now their YouTube
host just really makes me want to scream
at the top of my lungs and excitement so
for those of you who follow me on
twitter or instagram you know that I was
actually in New York last week and I was
there for Teen Vogue I was only there
for like two days but we filmed the
first announcement video which is up on
Teen Vogue's youtube channel so i will
link it right here as well as in the
description box of this video basically
it was the best day of my life I got to
tour the Teen Vogue offices and meet all
of the members of the editorial team I
got to meet and chat with the editor in
chief of Teen Vogue Amy Astley she was
so sweet and kind there's so awesome
getting to know her I got to check out
and raid the beauty closet as well as
the fashion closet which was so awesome
to see and I'm just so honored and
thrilled to be a part of this amazing
team and family so those of you guys are
wondering what it means
to be team votes YouTube hosts to sum it
up we're going to be doing anything and
basically everything on that channel
this is the first time teen vogue has
ever done anything like this before so
we're still kind of going with the flow
but basically I'm going to be covering
red carpet events for you guys and
collaborating with your favorite
celebrities and filming videos here on
the streets interacting with other
people I don't want to give too much
away but we're just gonna be doing a lot
of fun and crazy things and I'm just so
so excited for this year and the fact
that this is happening here on YouTube
which is obviously where this all
started is so awesome because you guys
are going to be coming on this adventure
with me watching all the videos and
telling us what you guys want to see I
hope you guys are at least half excited
