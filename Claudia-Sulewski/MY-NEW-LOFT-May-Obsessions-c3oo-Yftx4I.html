channel get familiar with the background
of this video because I just moved into
my new place that's why it is so
actually let me just get out of the
frame so you can see a little sneak peek
about Oh hot Dale that's affect the
kitchen before we get started I quickly
want to give a shout out to my blog
channel because I have been vlogging the
entire moving process for you guys so if
you guys want to see what my new place
looks like and how I've been unpacking
packing organizing things I've been
buying all that good stuff then you can
binge all those vlogs right down below
and while you're over there be sure to
subscribe to my blog channel this
morning or actually woke up with 600 K
on there which I got so so excited about
click down there if you want to see what
my entire place looks like and let's
jump into my main obsession my first
obsession is a show and the little bias
because I'm in the show but tag season 2
just came out a few weeks ago and it is
so intense it's so good I think there's
five episodes out right now you guys can
watch them on go 9zi let me know if you
guys check that out my next favorite is
a very random one but I really wanted to
bring it out because I've been obsessed
with since February 19 it's a speaker a
portable speaker called splash tunes and
drew bought this for me for my birthday
I swear to god this is the greatest
present anyone has ever given me I have
taken this with me to every single trip
that I've had sin and I just like stick
it on the hotel mirror as I'm getting
ready and stuff so good next up I've got
one skincare brand that I want to talk
about I discovered a new brand over the
past two months I would say and I am
just slowly converting the brand is
called cap re and all their products are
coconut oil-based but they have the
information on their website in
comparable to like your regular coconut
oil that's in your kitchen because
they're very particular with what type
of oil I use and all that stuff and it's
meant for your face it's meant for your
body and it's very gentle I talked about
this in one of my blogs but one of the
first products that I started
/ was there coconut rose toner this
stuff smells so good you can throw it on
over or under your makeup I love using
this like throughout the day to like
refresh in my face but also I've been
loving if they're coconut melt which is
a very very simple product it's
literally just their coconut oil but
this stuff is so good it comes with this
little baby scooper and so you just
scoop a little bit you melt it in your
fingers and then you rub it all over
your body I've been loving this for my
legs and my arm what I've noticed with
this stuff is that it actually sinks in
and soaks up a lot sooner than just like
regular coconut oil and it just leaves
you with such silky smooth skin my next
favorite is also coconut oil-based I
don't know why actually my next two are
all smoked coconut but this is a teeth
whitening product that I've been using
for a while now and they used to come
with like a bigger baggie but I threw it
out so I just have the individual packs
but it's called my white secret 100%
natural activated charcoal for whiter
teeth this is a much more natural way to
do it and it's actually funny because
since there's activated charcoal in here
the oil is black so all you do is to rip
off the top and then you squeeze it into
your mouth and squish it around they
recommend to swirl around for 5 to 15
minutes so I'll just like watch a
YouTube video while it's just like
sitting in my mouth but it's funny cuz
it's black so your teeth look all gross
but anyways I love this stuff it's a
natural way of whitening your teeth and
also the packets are just freakin
adorable and they're so great for
traveling
my third coconut biggest favorite I
don't have with me I wish I did it's the
new toasted coconut cold brew from
Starbucks holy crap I tried for the
first time I think over Coachella
weekend and it has been the only thing
that I've been ordering from Starbucks I
love it it's so good I don't know how it
is for you because I know they're like
squirting some toasted coconut syrup in
there you don't have to clean it but I'm
just saying if you haven't tried it yet
you need
so good no I on to the makeup favorites
I'm going to start off with lip balm I
don't know why there was hesitation
there I was driving for something else I
love this stuff so much I buy the brand
fresh
so obviously I'm already sold small you
know I'm insane but it's there sugar
advanced therapy lip balm and this stuff
is so good for starters the packaging is
so cute and it's very like high-quality
the chapstick itself glides on so
smoothly and it also has like a like a
really refreshing tropical smell to it
any time I let anyone borrow this every
single time they like okay wait whoa
what is this I need to know it's amazing
next up I've got a concealer that I
wanted to bring up when it comes to
foundation I'm obsessed with Make Up For
Ever HD I've been using that line for
like years now so here I am showing you
guys a concealer from that exact line
but these are their Ultra HD invisible
cover concealers I have two different
shades so I like to switch off from
we've got Y 33 and Y 31 let's just
depending on if I'm doing like under my
eyes are covering acne from my
experience the formula of this is
basically the thicker more full coverage
version of their foundation basically so
I'll just apply on the foundation and
then whatever is left over to cover up
then I'll just get this on yeah I'm
loving them all so they're just so cute
and little oh my god
next up I've got kind of a crazy eye
shadow I've only worn it a few times but
I thought it was worth bringing up but I
love like sparkly eyes holographic cool
funky eye shadows that you can wash over
the entire lid and then just have that
for your look this one is actually from
Topshop I've never tried their makeup
before a makeup artist Cheyenne
recommended this to me she showed it to
me and I was like well I need that and
so I ended up getting it it's in the
shade changeling and there are so many
colors going on in this one shade
depending on what angle you look at it
from front on it kind of looks like teal
and aqua marine ish with the second you
turn towards the light and look towards
the side it looks pinky and purple
and there's reflexes of like maybe even
a little blue in there I don't even know
basically this juice is really really
pretty and cool to look at and anytime I
where everyone's like whoa that's really
cool that's different
yeah the formula feels very like velvety
almost wet but not at all like it
definitely has a dry finish and it stays
on all day and for Topshop makeup I'm
very very impressed next up we've got a
beauty tool I guess you could say I love
the Beauty Blender I've been using it
for so long
I still continue to use it but lately I
have been using it's from Real
Techniques they have a lot of different
shapes and sizes so yeah I'll have the
title of what this one is specifically
called and it basically looks like a
Beauty Blender except it's got this flat
edge that cuts right here and this is so
useful when you're just patting on like
larger areas of your face I also love
their diamond shaped one I have like the
marble one but I think this one has got
to be my own favorite I know sometimes
people are worried about whether they're
going to be softer or harder than like
the Beauty Blender because a lot of
beauty sponges are way too hard
this one feels just as soft it's not
softer and yeah this one is actually a
little dance because I just use it so
that wraps up today's video if you guys
