but the one consistent thing is how I
like to wind down at nighttime today I'm
partnering with Braun to show you guys
what I do to relax and recharge to take
on the next day the first thing I always
do when I get home is turn on my
himalayan salt lamp sounds silly but
there are so many physical benefits
apart from mentally checking myself into
it's time to relax and wind down mode
continuing to set the vibes I love to
bump some tunes I just like to play my
daydreaming playlist through my TV on
Spotify I'll link it down below if you
guys want to give it a listen but this
next step I do every single day and it
might not seem relaxing but for some
reason it helps clear my head I love to
go through my entire apartment and just
go through and clean any dishes wipe
down any counters anything that's been
moved and I'll usually give myself like
a 20-minute window so that I'm not going
too crazy or get too bored with it and
it almost kind of makes it a game too
once I get everything in order it is
time to get myself in order a ka change
into comfier clothes
take a shower take off my makeup
everything so I'm starting off by just
taking off all my jewelry because I
don't like to shower with it on and also
I decided to throw my hair up and not
get it wet because I was working out the
next morning so it was gonna get gross
anyways a new habit I've started to
implement into my routine is body dry
brushing which I never even knew was a
thing until Lauren told me about it
there are so many benefits to it and
it's great to do right before the shower
so as the water is heating up I quickly
brush over my legs ankles knees arms
elbows stomach you name it I'll go
towards the heart Direction wise my next
at-home self-care obsession is using an
IPL device on a weekly basis this one
here is the Venus silk expert three
powered by braun you guys know I've been
working with them a bunch to try out
their different hair removal products
and this one is my favorite for my
underarms because I'm showing them off a
lot and I would like more permanent long
lasting results basically the way that
it works is it reads your skin tone to
deliver just the right amount of light
that reduces hair growth permanently if
you stick with it normally you'll see
results after four to six weeks but
personally my hair was getting lighter
and finer just after three making it so
convenient you don't have to go to the
salon you can do all this at home and
you are saving so much money it's FDA
approved to use anywhere below your
cheekbones if you guys are interested in
trying it out for yourselves you can
purchase the Venus self expert 3 powered
by Braun on Amazon you can just click
the link in my description box I can't
recommend it enough seriously after that
I love putting lotion all over my body
before I go to bed because it really
helps to moisturize my skin and sink in
overnight so I'm just doing that and
then following it with my skincare
routine if you guys want to see what
products I specifically use in my face I
talked all about it in my last
so I'll have that link down below see
this is my favorite part of the evening
this is like the the climax everything
we've been working towards I throw on a
pair of clean sweats I go back
downstairs and I just lather in doing
nothing I love to have candles burning
at nighttime even if I'm alone it's
still like a luxurious thing for me I
don't know I love doing it all so
whether it's a little glass of wine or
some hot tea today I decided to make
some tea but I'm just boiling some water
guys I've been obsessed with this tea
I've definitely talked about it before
but it is the new me Organic white rose
tea it is so so good at this point I
basically just do whatever I want to
kind of let myself relax and not really
think or work so whether it's go on
YouTube or go through you know Instagram
watch some TV lately I've been of course
obsessed with a Bachelor and this is us
those are kind of my go-to s that I'm
watching regularly once my better
judgment decides Claudia it is late you
need to go to bed and get a full night's
rest for the next day then I had back
upstairs to brush my teeth if they're on
my hair in a bun and also I always
always have a giant glass of water so
that I can drink it throughout the night
or the second I wake up and the last
thing I like to do is fill out my five
minute journal app I used to use the
book but now I'm obsessed with the app
because you can add photos and it's
super easy and accessible clearly didn't
really fill it out today but I really
really try to do this almost every
single day and it is an amazing way to
end it that's it for my nighttime
routine thanks guys for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
