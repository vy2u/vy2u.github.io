channel today's video is going to be all
about how / what I do to stay happy
I asked if you guys want to see this
video in my last video and I got such an
overwhelmingly amazing response from you
guys so I got me really excited to film
this for you and share my tips with you
guys I guess before I get into this I do
quickly want to make a disclaimer
because I know that this can honestly
sometimes be a sensitive subject for a
lot of people I only personally speaking
for myself and what I like to do and
what has worked for me so just know that
this video is coming from good
intentions I just feel very passionate
about this stuff so I want to share with
you guys and who knows maybe this stuff
that I'm going to say might seem like
common knowledge to some of you guys and
hopefully there's a few of you guys out
there who will gain a lot from this
video so just go into this video with an
open mind and no judgments please and
yeah that is it for the disclaimer let's
get into it I did write a few things
down we're just we're going to do it
we're let's get into it
so I personally am a huge believer in
your mentality being your reality and I
know I mentioned this earlier and it's
so cliche but I am seriously such a big
believer in its that whatever is going
on in your head is going to affect the
outcome of your actual life as far as
the things coming to you and how you
react to everything I think it all
starts in here and works itself into
your life I guess to start off what is
happiness for me I believe that
happiness is a genuine feeling that you
experience that starts from the inside
there's obviously very many things that
can trigger happiness for example
receiving a delightful surprise or you
know a gift or receiving great news or
something just in general something good
coming your way usually results in you
feeling happy and I think everyone can
relate to that that's kind of like the
first layer of experiencing happiness
it's the obvious things that come into
your life and that are positive and it's
just human nature to feel happy from
those things but I think what a lot of
people don't realize is that you
actually have the choice to be happy
every single moment in every single day
and
is when it gets tricky because we as
humans encounters so many different
experiences and situations and people
that aren't always totally amazing and
good you know life happens sometimes you
get a really bad grade or you receive
really awful news or amazing news
whatever it may be there's so many ups
and downs as a human we all experience
them and for me personally the best way
to stay happy through all of those ups
and downs that you're experiencing every
single day is don't don't done having an
optimistic mindset I'm sure a lot of you
guys are thinking okay Claud this is not
a revolutionary thoughts I totally saw
this coming voil√° and I know it's one
of the biggest cliches in the entire
world
but there's a reason why it's a cliche I
think what a lot of people hear a really
simple basic overuse sentence like just
be a positive person you'll be happier
it kind of goes in one ear and out the
other because it just seems like an
obvious answer but I want to take that
cliche and break it down for you guys
and talk about how I like to apply it
into my life and how it has honestly
changed the way that I go about all of
my days having an optimistic mindset the
first thing that I can stand by is you
do not have to be born with it I
personally believe that your thought
patterns are very similar to your
physical habits and just like any other
type of habit if you make the conscious
effort to you can change it oh my gosh I
feel like I'm getting so pretty I'm
sorry guys but okay let's continue I
would say that the biggest way to become
an optimistic person is to start
becoming aware of how you initially
react to something that's coming your
way
good or bad every time life throws
something at you within that split
second you are reacting to it mentally
whether you say something or ask
something out the first thing that
happens is you mentally react to it and
a lot of the times we don't even think
about that we're not even aware of it it
just happens and then it affects however
we end up physically reacting to that
thing or event this probably happened a
few years ago but one of the biggest
realizations that I personally had was
there is always a positive way of
thinking about
everything that happens to you there is
always a positive route that you can
take but because of that there is always
a negative way of thinking as well to
better explain myself and get you guys
on the same page I'm going to start off
with an example that I'm sure a lot of
you guys can relate with and it is going
through a breakup
obviously it totally depends on the
personal situation because there are so
many reasons why people break up but it
can very often be viewed as a negative
thing I'm a huge believer in everything
happening for a reason I feel like any
time something sad or unfortunate
happens in my life down the line I end
up realizing that I totally needed that
to happen for a specific reason you can
easily look back at a past relationship
and think I regret that so much why did
I think that was right for me I wasn't
happy blah blah blah this there's so
many things you can complain about but
at the same time those are the life
lessons that you need to experience and
go through to learn as a person my past
relationships have taught me what I look
for a partner and what I don't look for
and how I am as a person in a
relationship and what I need to work on
to give you guys another example living
out in a city you experience a lot of
traffic and that is something that
people get super upset about because
it's something that life just throws at
you and you kind of don't really have
that much power over it when I
personally know that I will be commuting
somewhere during rush hour
I obviously prep for it and I know to
meet my house early so that I get on
time but once you're actually in the car
and you're sitting there for over an
hour trying to get to wherever you need
to be you could totally get upset and
dread every single minute of it but I
personally like to mentally prepare for
that and use that time sitting in my car
to my advantage so what I'm sitting in
traffic I like to go through the
discover new music playlist on Spotify
or the new music Friday and I will just
go through playlists and try to discover
new songs because I often forget to do
that when I'm sitting at home like
editing videos or working or whatever so
I love using that
time to discover new music and I end up
finding like V greatest music ever when
I'm sitting in the middle of traffic and
it's kind of strange because now that I
have that mindset and that perspective
on driving in traffic I kind of get
excited for it and so in that situation
I am taking the positive route and
optimistic route at this point I'm sure
a lot of you guys are thinking okay
Claudia I understand what you're saying
but what if I just personally don't have
that in me or I can't control the
thoughts and emotions that I have when I
react to something negative and that is
what you can't get stuck thinking
because if you think that then obviously
that is what's going to happen this
might sound strange but sometimes you
just have to repeat things in your head
over and over again until you start to
actually believe them and the one thing
that I've definitely learned is you
can't just become an optimistic person
overnight it's totally a growing process
and experience that you just continue to
ride I started working on this and
becoming more aware of my thoughts
probably a few years ago and it's
definitely taken quite a bit of time for
me to reach a point where I start to
just think about everything in a
positive way without even trying to and
that's kind of the goal that at least I
personally want to always reach where
negative thoughts and ideas don't even
cross your mind because your head space
is filled up with so much positivity I'm
not sitting here saying that this is
like scientifically proven or anything
like that but I've had so many
conversations with people about this
subject and I've read so many books and
it works for so many people and I am
sitting here telling you guys that it
works for me the more I work on it and
the more I sit back and just think to
myself okay Claudia how are you
approaching this situation right now the
more I start taking the positive route
in things to tie all this into happiness
the more I started to practice this and
just do it
the happier I became as a person I know
a lot of people might disagree with this
but I personally believe in energy good
and bad energy I think that when you
approach a situation with
a positive attitude good energy whether
it's through a conversation with someone
or work that you're creating whatever it
is I believe that when you're exerting
that positive energy it will come back
to you whether it's immediately or down
the line
and through that I've been able to
attract so many amazing people into my
life that also are very happy positive
people and opportunities and random
things that seem like teeny miracles oh
my gosh so you guys might think that I'm
totally insane by saying all this I
would say that is my only secret secret
um to becoming a generally and genuinely
happy person so whether this video was
life-changing or just common sense for
you I think it's a really good reminder
to just know that you can choose to be
happy
you don't have to only be happy when
good things come your way because at the
end of the day life is gonna throw so
many things at you you're going to
experience heartbreaks and losses
whether it's your family members or
friends or a job or an opportunity that
you really wanted some things you just
don't have control over honestly any
time I go about any shitty situation in
a positive way I kind of give myself
like a little pat in the back and think
hey Claudia
good job like you're staying motivated
in something that might not necessarily
seem so amazing in the moment but yeah I
would say that is kind of a general
summary of what I wanted to share with
you guys that I didn't what words and of
course there are so many other ways to
be happy like music brings so much
happiness to my life as well as just you
know like happy people and all that
stuff but I think all of that you start
to attract in your life through being a
positive person so optimistic mindset is
like the deep root of my personal source
of being a happy person if that makes
sense okay I see it guys I'm already
getting back into it and I need to cut
off this video because it's probably
gonna be way too long yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed today's video also if you
have any advice or wisdom to give not
me but all of you viewers as well please
comment down below I would love love to
hear what you guys have going on up here
because you guys are so smart and I
learned so much from you guys so
definitely share all that stuff down
below yeah let's talk about this stuff
in the comments I'm so so excited to
hear what you guys have to say and
hopefully I was able to get the message
across correctly it's very easy to F up
and offend people on the internet and
stuff like that but just know this video
was only meant to share the things that
make me who I am
alright I love you guys so so so so much
and I will see you guys in a new video
probably like a week from now yeah let's
do that
