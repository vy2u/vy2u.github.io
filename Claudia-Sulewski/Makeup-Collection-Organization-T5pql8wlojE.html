is kind of like my eye makeup drawer so
before I actually go into what's in my
first jar I just want to mention that

and that's an flippin hot and then I
have two lip stains from Revlon just
bitten line this is crave and this one
is physical it's passion so yeah by far
this is my favorite drawer it's kind of
the craziest as you can tell an
obsessive lip products so the next
drawer is just all my Coastal Scents
palettes I know there's really not too
much going on in these but I decided I'm
going to just show you how they look so
I have the Coastal Scents warm palette
which I'm obsessed with this one I use
it the most it looks like that then I
have just the regular original
eighty-eights color eye palette which
some of it is matte and some of it is
shimmery so it looks like that and then
back here I just got the 88 Ultra
shimmer eyeshadow palette and it looks
like this it's super messy because some
of them are kind of crafts which kind of
sucks but that's all that's in this
drawer next I have a drawer for all my
BH Cosmetics palettes I only have two
but once I start getting more than I
will start putting them in this drawer
so the first one is the 88 tropical
shimmer eyeshadow palette from BH
Cosmetics it looks like this
so pretty I love this then I've also got
the 120 color palettes looks like that
and then it actually opens up at the
bottom so it kind of has two layers of
eyeshadows which is really nice
especially for beginners so I just got
two in there then the next Shore is my
first drawer that kind of contains on my
little makeup bag so I've got this one
like an also won another Ulta line the
Lancome and then just two little ones
back there and then in this store I also
have just more makeup bags I just have a
big one right there this one from
Victoria's Secret that I got for free
one time and then this is my Sigma
makeup brush holder which looks like
this I can open it it just looks like
that I like using this for traveling a
lot because it's super convenient and it
keeps all my brushes nice and safe then
in the next door it's kind of
miscellaneous so I've got my brush
guards here in this little bin and then
also I have a ELF daily brush cleanser
or cleaner and I also have their brush
to shampoo and then another brush
cleaner from Sephora then I have this
plastic Ulta bag that's just filled with
samples whenever I buy from like
ulta.com or something they just give a
bunch of samples so I just have them in
there I've to whatever they're called
hand sanitizers and then this random
little thing I don't even know them so
then in the last drawer I just have
cotton balls some q-tips and then also
some more q-tips so nothing really
special at the bottom but yeah just that
so that is how it looks I love this
makeup cart so much I definitely
recommend getting it so once again I got
it from Office Depot and yeah I got the
lamp from Target so that is it for
today's video I was super excited to do
it so I hope you guys were as excited as
I was and yeah so I will talk to you
