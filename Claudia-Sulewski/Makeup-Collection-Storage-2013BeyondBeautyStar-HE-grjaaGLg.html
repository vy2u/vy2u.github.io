that is everything that is in my lip
drawer my next drawer is a little bit
less crowded so I've just got a few of

I've got the naked
the first Naked palette which looks like
that as well as the Naked 2 palette love
these and use them all the time
next I've got the lorac Pro to go
palette which is an eye makeup palette
as well as a face palette so I've been
using this a lot lately and then lastly
I've got the Naked basics palette and I
also keep the Naked flush palette in
here from Urban Decay but can't really
find it at the moment um but it would be
right there back there so we're gonna
pretend like it's there in my next
drawer I like to keep all of the other
makeup brushes that I own that I don't
use every day so back here I've just got
all of my face brushes I normally buy
brushes from Sigma if you guys are
wondering and then down here I've just
got my eye makeup brushes also if you
guys can see on the side here
I just keep mini bath and Bodyworks hand
sanitizers because I love to use these
before I apply on any makeup my next
drawer is a little bit more random so
I've just got some makeup brush guards
as well as another oil absorbing sheets
then I've also stocked up on some makeup
remover wipes back here and elf daily
brush cleanser as well as the shampoo
then I also got this cleanser from
Sephora some fashion tape which I never
used but I feel like I may have to use
it one day so it's just sitting there
and - no three face sponges that I
haven't used yet my next drawer only has
two things I've just got some cotton
balls as well as some cotton rounds and
I just got these so they're still in the
packaging but I may like take them out
and put them in bins or something but
yeah so I just have those two in there
my second-to-last drawer has got a bunch
of different products in here
that I have not used yet so I've got
some backups or just some extra products
that I've received from companies or
something and I'm waiting to try out so
I've just got some benefit products as
well some BH LA Colors a few nail
polishes
and Knicks palates I actually used these
two but I just keep them there as well
but yeah this drawer just has any makeup
that I really like haven't used yet then
down here at the bottom of course I've
got my Coastal Scents palettes because
honestly who like what youtuber has not
gotten me is I feel like everyone went
through their Coastal Scents phase so I
definitely recommend these palettes for
any beginners that want to try out you
know different looks with different
colors because they're pretty
inexpensive and they've got a lot of
eyeshadows in them and they're great
qualities so that is what I keep in my
last bin so that is it for today's video
I hope you guys enjoyed it and comment
down below and tell me what your
favorite makeup brand is because I
always love hearing you guys's opinions
and stuff so definitely leave that down
