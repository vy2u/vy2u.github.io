would be the normally you
for no it's quinoa it is not quite oh
okay go to the free dictionary calm and
type it in and click the voice button
it's a criolla that's a machine it's a
robot but I'm in search of any YouTube
video about quinoa and you will see that
they pronounce it quinoa that's probably
because they don't know the right way so
you think everyone in the entire world
is pronouncing an area I love news
called soft meow there you go there we
go
brown sell something like a fit or just
talk about this shut aquarius but okay
