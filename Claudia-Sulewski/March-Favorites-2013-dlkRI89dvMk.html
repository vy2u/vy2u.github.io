my March favorites and if you guys can
see what is behind me I did get a new
bed it's not really a bed yet though
yeah my mattress isn't coming in till
Tuesday so I kind of have no bed right
now I'm just kind of sleeping on a
mattress on the floor it's been great so
that's this how I've been living so I
guess I'm gonna start out with my
fashion favorites because I just have
two of them the first ones are these
boots right here and I've been wanting
Doc Martens for a very very long time
except I don't even know if there's like
a Doc Martens store close to me so I
don't know I never really want to buy
like $100 shoes online hoping that they
would fit me right so what I was
shopping on go Jane calm I found these
shoes for literally like 38 dollars
which is crazy and they look exactly
like Doc Martens - when I saw these
online I knew I had to buy them because
they're so inexpensive compared to the
real Doc Martens
so I don't know I've just really been
liking them and they match with a lot of
my stuff and they're also really
comfortable but keep in mind that if you
do buy these from go Jane they do run
very big I'm normally a size 7 and these
are actually a size 6 so I try to go
like a size down or at least half a size
down because these do look really big
and they like run big - my next favorite
is this military style jacket from
blender blender comm and I still don't
want to say it but um yeah I avoid this
in like two of my past videos and I wear
this all the time I really really love
it it's very simple it doesn't have any
obnoxious like badges on it cuz like
some of them have like weird stuff on it
it's just very plain and simple it has
some pockets
I like to roll up the sleeves like a
quarter of the way so I've been wearing
this like all the time I don't know if
you guys can tell but I'm standing in
today's video which is really weird for
me because this is the first time I've
ever stood in a video I feel like I can
do so much like I can I can move around
and I don't know I kind of like it I
don't know why so next up I have two
favorite nail polishes that I've been
wearing a lot lately the first one is
the American Apparel nail polish and
this is in a mouse it's kind of like a
topi muddy color and I just feel really
cool when I wear this to be quite honest
I don't know I just feel like it's so
cool and mature looking and it just
looks awesome on your nails and the
other one that I've been linking is the
Sally Hansen complete nail polish in
jaded 5 or 0 it's kind of like a Tiffany
blue color but it's a little bit more
like muted a little bit darker it's not
as like bright and whoa BAM so it's kind
of more subtle the only thing that sucks
is you'd have to use three coats with
this because this nail polish is pretty
sheer so that's kind of a downside next
I have to cheek products that I've been
loving the first one is the benefit fine
one one and it looks like this it was in
one of my haul videos but it basically
has like a highlight color a pinky and
an orange peach color and basically what
you do is you just swipe it across your
cheeks and then you blend it out it
blends really really nicely I was scared
that it wouldn't but it really does and
then you can also put this on your lips
as well so this is kind of like a
all-in-one product and it's great it's
perfect for traveling and I think it's
really nice for like the warmer weather
then also I've been obsessed with the
coralista blush don't know why it's
taken me this long to buy this blush
because it's been around for so long but
it looks like that I'm wearing
of it today and it's just so nice I'm
definitely going to be wearing this like
every single day this summer next up I
would loving it the naked Urban Decay
basics palette and you guys know that
I'm not really into the whole like dark
eye makeup like I like to go very like
natural and simple so I've been using
this palette a bunch this month it looks
like this there are mostly light colors
but there's like a few dark ones and
yeah I really really like it I love
highlighting like my inner corners and
stuff with this palette and you could
definitely use faint as like an eyebrow
filler as well so I just think that this
palette is very like universal and stuff
and yeah I basically have been using
this like ever so today next up I have a
foundation and it's actually a simple
but it's the hello flawless oxygen Wow a
brightening makeup and this is in the
shade I'm plush and precious I got this
as a sample when I made an order on Ulta
calm and I've been using this stuff like
crazy so once I run out of this little
sample I'm definitely gonna get the full
size because it perfectly matches with
my skin tone right now and it's really
really nice lasts a long time and yeah I
have only good things to say about this
so far next up I have a candle that I
have been burning like crazy and it's
weird because it looks like I haven't at
all but I have it's just yeah and this
is the Bath and Body Works blackberry
grapefruit candle I can't even describe
how amazing this candle smells like my
brother walked in and he was like
Claudia this candle smells like sex I'm
like I know that was a little
appropriate but it smells so good like I
can't even describe it I guess it smells
like blackberries and grapefruit just
get it if you see this the Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works just smell it and buy it you will
not regret it
next up I've been loving my little Louie
Vuitton coin purse I got this about two
months ago and I've been using this
every single day every time I go out
because it's just so convenient it's
little I don't carry cash on me I just
like cards and stuff so it fits
everything very nicely and then also I
just keep my little key on it which is
Cartman I don't know if this would be
considered a must be favorite figuring
that I got this last night but I got a
new phone um I've been using this piece
of crap for four weeks three weeks I
don't know but this is the iPhone 4 and
black it's seen better days so I just I
can't even like read through the screen
so yeah finally got anyone I got the
iPhone 5 in whites I don't know why I
got it away I just I feel like since
I've had the black one for so long I
just kind of wanted something different
and yeah I need to get a case before
this happens to this phone because it's
not gonna be good so hopefully you oh
wait I have songs that I want to show
you guys I've also really been loving
Spotify if that counts as a favorite but
it's hooked up to my facebook so you
guys can't really see my playlist it was
actually funny because for the longest
time I didn't realize that you can put
it on a private session so every single
time I would listen to a song like it
would post it on my facebook so one of
my playlists is so it's tough so every
time I would listen to that playlist it
would say on Facebook and my friends
always make fun of me because they're
like oh are you so it sound like yeah um
but I figured it out I like this song
it's really weird
got it by Boys Noize featuring Snoop
Dogg
I also really like shake shake shake by
bronze radio return alright these are
kind of getting old but I really like
get free by Major Lazer that's kind of
slower but it's really good
I like the morning by RIE Quan with push
of tea and some other name that I can't
see yes that's I'm sure a good series
and yeah I'm gonna stop there before I
bore you guys it up so that is
everything for today's video I hope you
guys enjoyed it and I will see you guys
her new on it very soon bye
South one star
