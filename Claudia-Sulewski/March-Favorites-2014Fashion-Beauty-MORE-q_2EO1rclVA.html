if I seem a little tired in today's
video that is because it is 10:00 a.m.
right now and that's really early for
someone who does online schooling but
I've got a lot of film today so I needed
to get things going pretty early in the
day today I'm going to be doing my March
favourites and March was an incredible
month for me I had so much fun I worked
a lot traveled a lot and I got to meet a
lot of new people including at you guys
so I went to Marco Island with my family
which I've lodged I'll have that linked
right here as well as in the downbar I
also went to New York City for a few
video shoots which I also vlog and I'll
have that linked you know on this page
and straight from New York I flew over
to Orlando Florida for playlist live
which is my all-time favorite YouTube
event I don't know why but it's always
so fun so I got to meet a lot of you
guys which is really exciting and I'm
actually in the process of editing my
playlist live vlog so it might be up I
know if it is it will be linked so I'm
first gonna start off by showing you
guys in my fashion favorites and during
the month of March I went a little
clutch crazy I bought a lot I used a lot
and now I'm stuck with a lot but I'm not
complaining because I love them so I'm
gonna show you guys my top three
clutches that I've been loving so the
first one looks like this it definitely
makes a statement as you can tell but
it's from Nasty Gal and I am completely
obsessed with like the slime looking
detail on it and just the colors I've
noticed that I've been incorporating a
lot of neon and bright colors into my
wardrobe which is really exciting
because I don't really like to wear a
lot of color during the winter time and
fall time so I've really been loving it
the whole neon trend for spring this
year and this clutch just fits
ESPA just sent me a really cute selfie
anyways this clutch fits right under
that trend I used to drink playlistlive
got a lot of compliments on it and I
think it's just so crazy and so fun my
next favorite clutch is not nearly as
bold as the first one and you guys have
probably seen this before because I got
is a while back but it looks like this
it's from forever 21 and I just love how
like the body of it is all black within
the flap is white and yeah I've been
using this a lot actually talking about
the March so definitely had to show that
one to you guys any less clutch is
definitely something it looks like this
it's also from Nasty Gal and as you can
see it has two pieces to it so the
bigger clutch is all clear and on the
inside it comes with a smaller clutch
which is so cool because it's silver but
then it shines like rainbow on the light
so I actually carried this at playlist
live for one of the days and I'll show
you guys the photo of my outfit I was
really obsessed with it and I thought it
just gave a nice weird touch to the
outfit it was cute so I liked it
my last fashion favorite would have to
be these heels right here I just hit
myself I kid you not
I wore these every single night at
playlist and they are so comfortable the
platform on the shoe is what sold me
because I think it looks so cool with
the little ridges right here and then it
crosses in the front it's just overall a
very beautiful shoe I think it's very
funky and spunky and I think if you
style in the right way they can look
very high-fashion and kind of
interesting so yeah I literally wear
these every school night at playlist and
I didn't mind I loved it my first makeup
favorite that I want to share with you
guys I've actually been using every
single day since I got it and it is the
Nivea lip butter and raspberry rose kiss
I don't know why it took me this long to
try this product out but this stuff here
let me show you what it looks like it's
just baby pink this stuff makes your
lips so smooth and so soft literally
ever since I got this product I have
never experienced dry lips and
that is saying a lot for me because well
to get technical here the air in my
house is very dry so my lips tend to get
very dry even just overnight I don't
even know what it feels like to have
chapped lips anymore it's amazing they
are as smooth as clouds you guys see any
lip cracks no cuz I don't either but
next makeup favorites would have to be
the benefit bigger than BB Big Easy
liquid to powder oil-free multi
balancing complexion Perfector I think
really serious about this title because
that was like a novel this BB cream is
one of their newer products so I was so
excited to try it out and I really like
it because it works just like any other
BB cream but since it dries in a powder
finish you don't have to set your face
with any powder so everyone who hates
putting on makeup unless you have to
film a video this product is great
because if I have to leave the house and
look somewhat you know acceptable then
this is great because it checks off
coverup and powder all in one who's
cooking it's 10:00 a.m. but if you guys
aren't search for a BB cream then I
definitely recommend this one it's a
keeper
my next makeup favorite is also from
benefit surprise surprise
but it is the highbrow glow pencil and
it looks like this it is a brow lifting
pencil so you apply it on your brow bone
but I also find that this works really
well in your inner tear-duct but I
really like the finish of this pencil it
has a very iridescent kind of pearly
look to it so it looks really nice
especially for you know springtime
coming up and stuff but it's just very
smooth it blends well and I've been
really liking this so what I'll do is
I'll tie this on my brow bone as kind of
like the base for my highlight on my
eyes and then I'll put like a lighter
powder on top to set it my next favorite
is the million dollar tan xtreme face
tanning lotion and this video isn't
sponsored by them or anything but
recently received a few products from
them so I've been trying them out and
this one is by far my favorite product
out of all of them honestly this is the
best tanning lotion that I've ever tried
for my face before this I would just use
Saint Tropez with one of the smaller
mitts but I really really like this one
it comes out very thin and it also comes
out white and what you do is just apply
it all over your face and within a few
hours you will slowly see the tan
gradually show on your face ever since I
got this stuff I've been using it twice
a week to maintain my tan surprise guys
my tan from Marco Island did not last
very long so this sucker right here has
been helping me maintain that glowy and
sunkissed goddess look like I'm obsessed
with this stuff so I mean I applied it
on last night and I mean I'm happy with
the results my next favorite is a nail
polish and it is the julep freedom Polly
Mayer topcoat and this may be the best
topcoat I have ever used my entire life
because I have it on my nails right now
and I painted my nails a week ago and
they still look perfect it's kind of
like using a gel topcoat but you don't
have to use the UV light and it's also
super easy to you know take off you just
use normal nail polish remover so I am
very very happy that I was able to get
my hands on this product because it is
the best topcoat I've ever used a week
guys a week and it still looks beautiful
my next favorite are headphones but
these are the friends tailor headphones
and I actually got these from beautycon
if they sent me I want to thank them if
you're watching this video but they just
sent them as a little thank-you for my
future participation with them so I will
be at beautycon New York if you guys
were wondering I'm very excited to go
out there and meet all of you guys but
yeah ever since I've got these I've been
using them like crazy and can we just
talk about how cute these are here is
what they look like on my god you
seriously cannot hear anything when you
wear them but as you can see they look
so cool and ahh I just love them my
necks
it has to do with food kind of I mean
you you eat it they are vitamins and
these are the by diffusion women's
complete multivitamin gummies and I want
to talk about these because I used to
buy the woman's like vitae craves and I
used to really like those
but ever since I tried these I've been
getting these because I just find these
to taste a lot better and they're also a
lot sugar the vitae craves aren't as
soft as these they're kind of a little
firmer and harder so I enjoy eating
these a lot more so I decided to put
them in this video and share my opinion
with you guys so if you guys are
currently eating the women's vitae
craves
I recommend the by diffusion because
these are ten times better
my next favorite are sunglasses and I'm
pretty sure I showed a pair in my last
favorites video
we were like the reflective ones I still
really love those but I got these
recently and I'm pretty sure I got them
from forever 21 because that's literally
where I buy all my sunglasses but they
look like this and I just think they are
so different and cool-looking
they're matte black except for the
actual shades of course but I just think
they have a really cool shape to them
they're basically like little squares
see sometimes with glasses it only looks
good when your hair is up so hold on a
second just kind of throw it up okay I
hate when you get the urge to sneeze and
then you don't know that I've got my
hair up but let's put these suckers on
they are different but I like them
alright I'm done now
so that is actually it for all my March
favorites I know I didn't really have a
lot I didn't have any music favorites
I'm sorry I'm a boring person be sure to
check out my vlog channel for all of the
exciting vlogs that I've been posting
this month and I will talk to you guys
for a new video very soon
yeah bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
