my may favorites video which I just
cannot believe because I cannot believe
that it is already June but I did
discover a bunch of new products this
month so I'm excited to share them with
all of you guys first starters I've been
loving two different lip products that
are both from Maybelline so the first
one is one of their color elixirs and
when the spike first came out I was a
little bit skeptical about the lighter
shades because I really loved my nude
lip colors but I'm also very picky when
it comes to those but all of that
changed when I tried it on for the first
time at beautycon so this is in the
shade nude illusion I really like this
color because it's a little bit darker
but not too dark and it also has like
the perfect amount of pink and nude in
it and just in general I really like
these elixirs because they're super
smooth on your lips they're very
moisturizing and the color payoff is
just incredible like it stays on for
hours and hours and it just doesn't make
sense to me I don't understand how these
work the second one that I want to talk
about is actually on my lips right now
and this is one of their color
sensational lipsticks in cinnamon so as
you can see it is a very very dark
almost brown nude no it it it pretty
much is of brown lipstick it's just a
very
taupey brown color and I've never tried
one of these lip colors before I got
this one I was super excited to try it
on and I ended up loving it so super
moisturizing all that stuff wonderful my
next favorite is actually a product
combined with a method that I like to
apply it so the product is my benefit
Sunbeam highlighter and I only have the
sample size of this so once I run out of
this I will definitely go and purchase
the full bottle but what I like to do
with this is right after I apply all of
my foundation on and my under-eye
concealer then I will just step this on
to any parts of my face that I can
highlight I am obsessed with
highlighting so I put it on the tops of
my cheekbones my nose a little bit
4head my Cupid's bow my chin literally
everywhere that is acceptable to
highlight and over that I will lightly
set my face with some powder so I found
that applying on highlights before your
powder just gives your face a really
subtle dewy finish that doesn't overkill
I also found that this doesn't really
work with powder highlights only like
the creamier liquidy ones it just makes
you look so sunkissed and golden and all
that beautiful stuff so if you guys try
out the method of putting it underneath
your powder then tweet me or something
so that we can share the excitement and
talk about how freaking amazing
this beauty trick is next up I want to
talk about two different eyeliners
because I couldn't decide which one I
loved more the first one is the benefit
they're real pump up liner and you guys
actually cannot pick this up yet it's
going to be in stores I think later in
June I will let you guys know but this
eyeliner is so unique and different I've
never seen anything like this before
but basically it is a just drop the
other one all you have to do is just
crank it at the bottom and you'll hear
the clicking and the product just shoots
up you don't have to worry about losing
your little gel jars and using the brush
and everything because this all comes in
one beautiful little pen product and
it's amazing I recently purchased the
Kat Von D tattoo liner this is the best
liquid eyeliner that I've ever used it
is so easy to use the tip is superfine
and the product just glides over your
eye it's it's amazing
my next favorite that I wanted to talk
about is actually an app and I'm sure
that a lot of you guys have heard about
it or even tried it out but I swear to
god this app is taking over the world
because I know so many youtubers that
use it and celebrities a bunch of my
friends do I wouldn't even be surprised
if B otta my mom uses the app so finally
after hearing a bunch of people talk
about this app I decided to try it out
for myself and see what all of the rave
is about and
completely understand because it is the
greatest invention in the entire app
world so Claudia what is this Epcot it
is called
the hunt so if you guys don't know what
it does then I will quickly explain it
right now basically you can think of it
as being at your fashion how should I
describe it
expert no that was awful I'm really bad
at describing things I'm gonna give you
guys a little scenario so let's say one
day you are scrolling on Pinterest or
tumblr or something and you see a super
cute outfit of Kylie Jenner wearing this
awesome outfit I don't know whatever and
you really want to know where she bought
the pants then basically what you can do
with this app is you just take a
screenshot of the photo and quickly
describe what you want the community to
find once you fill all that out you post
it on the beautiful little hunt world
and spend if anyone on the app knows
exactly where to purchase those pants
then they can just give you the link and
voila you know exactly where kylie
jenner's pants are from so I personally
just love looking through other people's
searches and seeing if I can find
anything for anyone and also since they
use tags you can type in different
things I was actually given the
opportunity to work with the hunt to
host a giveaway for you guys and of
course I was in because who doesn't love
giveaways so all you have to do is just
click on the link in the downbar to
download the app which is free by the
way then after that just search beyond
the star on the app to add items to my
style me hunt so any outfits or clothing
items that you guys think I would like
or kind of fit with my style and I will
be choosing one winner to win a $100
gift card to forever 21 so for your
convenience I will have all of the
contest details in the down bar so that
you can read them through and enter
properly I'll also be posting the dates
in the downbar when I will be choosing
my winner so next up I've got two
fashion favorites that I wanted to show
you guys so the first one would have to
be my overalls and I have been wearing
like crazy this month because I am just
obsessed with them so these are from
PacSun I featured them in one of my
recent hauls which I will link in the
downbar but they're just light wash
they're short and they are just so
perfect I love them so much and my
second is kind of strange but they would
have to be my Nike 5.0 free runs and I
do use these two workouts I do pretty
low intensity workout nowadays so
whether it's bike riding or going for a
walk or a jog so I don't really sweat in
these too much but I've actually been
wearing these a ton with my outfits
which sounds really weird but it's
actually a really big trend in Europe
right now to wear like sports sneakers
with any fancier you know everyday
outfits so I've actually been doing that
a ton lately I'll show you guys a photo
that I posted on Twitter a kind of an
example of how I would style these but
they are just so comfortable and it's
perfect if you're just running around
the day going grocery shopping and
running errands and stuff like that so
I've been really obsessed with just
wearing these everywhere I go
yay for comfort next up I want to share
a few of the food favorites that I've
been loving this month because a lot of
you guys do not know this but I've
actually been eating vegan for the past
month and I don't really want to get
into huge detail about why I switched or
anything like that because I know that a
lot of people have a lot of pinions
about you know that specific topic so I
don't really want to get into that but I
will say that I have been loving it and
as of right now I don't really have any
desire to switch back to eating animal
and animal by-products I've just been
feeling a really good inside I have so
much natural energy I barely drink
coffee or tea anymore because I'm always
just very awake and alert and it's just
it's been amazing but because of that
I've actually been trying a whole bunch
of different recipes like mushroom fake
hamburgers I've also done these little
burrito reps with like lettuce and vegan
pizzas and
no it's been really fun but I want to
share with you guys a few of the kind of
simpler snacks that I've been loving so
the first one would have to be hummus
I've always loved hummus but I kind of
went hummus crazy this past month in
particular I've been loving the ceders
hummus and a roasted red pepper and what
I do is I buy these little like carrot
chips they're kind of zigzag but their
little circle carrot chips and I'll just
dip them into the hummus and eat them
sometimes if I'm feeling tortilla chips
I can also do that but I've been loving
hummus my next food favorite would have
to be medjool dates I'd like to buy my
dates from Cheerios because that's where
I can get them cheapest but you can use
these for so many different things I put
them into smoothies you can make
different like little bars with them and
all this stuff and recently what I've
been doing with these a ton is making
date milk and you guys can search it
onto YouTube I'm sure there's a bunch of
tutorials and stuff but basically you
just grab like a handful of dates with a
bunch of water sometimes I splash in a
little bit of almond milk and a few
vanilla drops once you blend that all up
together it just creates the greatest
drink in the entire world it's like a
milky caramel even illa e milk shaky
tasting thing and it's just so good I
just wanted to detail about how much I
love these and the card was full that
was definitely a sign for me to shut up
and move on to the next item so I'm done
talking about dates my max food favorite
would have to be homemade sweet potato
fries if you guys have never tried them
before I highly recommend you go to
store pick up some sweet potatoes and do
exactly what I say right now after you
watch this video because they are so
good so what I like to do is shave the
potatoes and slice them into evenly
sized wedges then I will just throw them
into a steamer for about 10 minutes
ish
I don't really time it I just kind of
stick the fork in and once it's soft
it's ready to go
but I like to steam them for about 10
minutes so that they soften in the
inside then I will pop them in the oven
at about 400 to 450 degrees kind of in
between and I'll just put them into the
oven for around 5 to 10 minutes once
they turn kind of golden then I like to
take it out flip them on to the other
side and put them back into the oven for
about 5 minutes and they are so good you
do not have to add any seasoning and no
salt no sugar no oil nothing all you do
is just throw the potatoes into the oven
and take them out and they are naturally
just so sweet and amazing tasting so
I'll just eat my homemade abates fries
with some organic ketchup from chair
joes and it is such an amazing meal it's
so good but that is actually it for
today's a favorites video so let me know
if you guys liked it by giving it a big
thumbs up I don't know why I always say
big thumbs because it's not like you can
choose between big or small or anything
like that but I will talk to you guys
very soon and that's it bye
hello everyone today I'm going to be
doing a what's in my purse video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
