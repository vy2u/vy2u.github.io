Claudia welcome back to filming I feel
like I haven't filmed a video for you
guys in so long so I'm so excited to be
doing this right now
don't worry this morning I asked you
guys to tweet me with hashtag ask
Claudia with questions that you want me
to answer when's your next adventure
with Logan it is in a week from now and
we are going to Chicago I will be
vlogging it down below and I'm really
excited it's about Tommy meets the
family grab the closest thing to your
right and break up with it okay I'm
sorry it all happened so quickly I
there's just listen there's a whole lot
of months in this world I just don't
know if you're the wiser
how do you keep yourself so happy and
motivated I really admire how you're
always so smiley
I just tried to answer this question
three times and every single time I
ended up talking for about 10 minutes
and still feel like I haven't said
everything that I wanted to so I'm gonna
switch this into a question and ask you
guys if you want me to do a video on how
I stay happy and motivated because it's
something that's very relevant in my
life right now I feel very passionate
about it and all of these mental
discoveries that I've been having lately
have really really changed the way that
my everyday life is I know this sounds
dramatic but it seriously made me such a
happier and more positive person but I
guess to keep it short and simple and
sweet and to give you guys at least like
a little answer for this question I
think a happiness all starts from in
here I'm a huge believer in your
mentality being your reality I know
that's such a cliche but I think the
second you start to take care of your
mindset and in general become aware of
the genuine thoughts that you're having
in any life situation whether it's
something good or bad happens to you all
the thoughts that you're having inside
of here will affect the outcome of
what's out here in your real world yeah
I'm already starting to slowly get into
it I don't want this answer to be so
long so maybe I'll do a video on it what
trends do you think is the most stunning
right now I personally
have been loving color as you guys know
I normally dress pretty neutral but
lately I have been all about the color
I've been wearing oh shiz ton of yellow
loving mustard yellow right now and just
in general I've been having a lot more
fun with my style and just wearing funky
pieces and things like that I got this
jacket yesterday and it's just makes a
really happy what's one thing you hate
most about being a youtuber there's a
lot of things that I love about being a
youtuber and they definitely outweigh
any cons that I have about it but I
would say the one thing that I've been
thinking about lately is I hate the
pressure of feeling like I need to
upload a video every single week not
necessarily because I don't want to be
creating content every week but I just
feel like when I first started making
YouTube videos and especially when I was
back at home I had so much time to focus
all of my energy into making videos and
so my content was really cool and
creative and different and stuff like
that and I still create really cool
videos that I personally am proud of but
it's very obvious that there's not as
many of them it's not as frequent which
is okay because I'm doing other things
in my life I'm getting into acting I'm
traveling at least once a month there's
always things going on and because of
that my YouTube channel kind of shifts
down onto my priority list but it's just
a sucky feeling knowing that I could be
making such cooler contents but because
I have the pressure of making videos
every week I just get caught up in
making simpler sit-down videos and then
never get around to doing cooler things
for my youtube channel if that makes
sense I'm just always constantly having
thoughts of Claudian you could be doing
better cloud you could be doing more so
yeah that's kind of it but that's not me
complaining at all because I still like
making any type of video if you could
act in any TV show slash movie what
would it be in what character which you
want to be I'm not opposed to any
specific genre but I think it would be
really cool to act in like an action
movie where I get to be a really badass
character who has to fight and has cool
weapons and stuff like that I'm
envisioning mr. and mrs. Smith I want to
be mistress mr. Smith I want
well where is that damn jacket from in
your mustard grill Instagram picture I
have never gotten so many questions
about one article of clothing here's the
Instagram this jacket was purchased from
Urban Outfitters what do you want to
achieve this year I want to achieve a
lot this year
I right now feel very confident in my
career and the things that I'm doing I
think the universe has a plan for us and
that everything that happens happens for
a reason
this video is filled with so many
cliches so Claudia but to fully answer
that question I really really want to
continue this acting thing because it
makes me very very happy and I feel very
passionate about it so that is something
that I definitely want to continue doing
yeah but if you see this do a part two
of your famous what do we have in here
line let me go get a bag real quick
why don't we have in here that's it I'm
done if you could change one thing about
yourself what would it be okay
physically I would change my shins it's
like the weirdest answer ever
I usually feel very content and
confident with myself my shins are just
really short compared to my torso and my
femur bones my thighs femur right um
it's been a wild cloth they just always
look really short on camera and in
pictures and I always notice it but what
can you do I am NOT happy with that
answer I'm gonna think of something else
I'm a very out of sight out of mind type
of person so it's really hard for me to
keep up with things that are not
physically in front of me I am the
absolute worst when it comes to staying
in contact with my best friends back at
home and stuff like that like we have
this group chat that continues on and
I'll like randomly just like scroll
through and just stalk all of it but I'm
so bad with keeping up with it and
actually responding and all this stuff
blah blah cuz I don't know I just get so
caught up with what's in front of me and
what I'm doing it just in general
texting I kind of suck at texting so
that's gonna be it for today's Q&amp;amp;A let
me know if you guys want me to make a
video about how I stay happy
and things like that as if my videos
couldn't get any more preachy and
annoying and cliche I will see you guys
in a new video next week and I love you
it's so so much I am so grateful for all
of you guys and you're the greatest
you're amazing thank you for continuing
to watch my videos it makes me very very
happy so thank you ok see you guys later
bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
