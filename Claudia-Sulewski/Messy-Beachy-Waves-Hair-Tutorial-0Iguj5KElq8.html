going to be doing a hair tutorial and
it's going to be kind of very messy
beachy wave type of hair it's not only
going to be curls it's gonna be more
like wavy hair I guess I like this
tutorial because it is using heaps so it
will be great for all different hair
types so I'm first just gonna start out
by brushing my hair and applying on some
sort of heat protectant so now that you
have done that you're just going to part
your hair and my hair is really really
thin and there's not much of it so all I
have to do is just split in half so I
already did one side and I'm just going
to throw it back and show you guys how
to do it with this side so the heat tool
that we're going to be using is a hair
straightener and I already made a video
showing you guys how to curl your hair
with it so I'll put that video on the
down bar but today we're going to be
doing something kind of a little bit
different than that
so yeah you just want to make sure to
heat it up so in pretty good amount I
have it at 350 that's what I always have
it at and yes so the way that you're
going to do this is you're just going to
grab a chunk of hair I'm actually going
to throw this hair back and then just
kind of pick it up as I go so the first
thing is you want to start out by kind
of positioning your hair straightener
like you're going to straighten it and
what you're gonna do is as you start at
the top you just want to curl or twist
the hair straightener either inwards or
outwards and you want to make sure to
twist it all the way to help kind of
define that wave and then after a couple
seconds just let go and then twist the
straightener the other way so I'm going
to be turning it inwards hold it let go
and then just keep doing that until you
reach the bottom now you can see you
have kind of a perfect bouncy like very
defined wave so that's what we're going
to be doing
all over our hair also if you want to
make your hair look a little bit more
kind of have more variety of curls what
you can do is to have kind of not as
defined curls you can twist it only half
way you can also hold it for a less
amount of time you can basically do
anything just to you know get the waves
that and want so I'm just gonna show you
guys how to do it again on another piece
so once again all you do is twist it
outward all the way and hold it then you
want to let go go down a little bit
twist it the other way go back down a
little bit twist it the other way and
just keep doing that same process over
and over again and there you go so now
I'm just gonna finish up the rest of my
head and I'll get back to you guys
most likely to end up on the back of a
milk box drink looks like
because wow I just totally film to the
entire ending and then I realize I
didn't even click the record button but
yeah I'm just gonna pretend to redo it
all over again but what you do is once
you have your hair kind of curled you
can shake your hair a bit and kind of
brush through your hair with your
fingers I don't recommend using a brush
just because you want to keep this look
very kind of messy and natural-looking
so you can just take your fingers and
pull apart all the little waves and
stuff and kind of scrunch it and then
also you want I'll sue what is it what
also you want to put in some kind of
hair spray I just use the durum organic
best dry shaping spray and all I really
did is when I spray it in there I just
kind of scrunched my hair as I did it so
just like that also if you want you can
tease the top of your hair and if you
don't know how to do this all you do is
just kind of pick up a piece and my hair
is already hair sprayed so it won't
really separate from the other hair but
all you just pick up a piece back home
it a couple of times with some sort of
brush or comb and then also you could
just buy some hairspray in there and I
don't know I mean I'm not really the
best at teasing but I just kind of
preferred going like this so once you
are all finished with the hair tutorial
your hair should look a little something
like this very very kind of messy and
beachy and wavy looking like I mentioned
in the beginning of this video and that
is about it so I don't really have
anything else to say except for like my
Facebook fan page if you want to also I
have a Twitter and I have a second
channel so everything will be in the
downbar and that is it I hope you guys
enjoyed today's video and I'll talk to
you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
