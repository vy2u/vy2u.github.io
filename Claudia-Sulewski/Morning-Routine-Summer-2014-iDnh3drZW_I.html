like to naturally wake up which tends to
be around 10 to 11 o'clock and the first
thing that I do is sit up in my bed and
check social media so that includes
Twitter Instagram Facebook all that
stuff I have all that stuff so if you
want to follow me you can links are in
the downbar but once I'm done with that
I like to get outta bed and head
straight to the bathroom the first thing
I must always do when waking up is brush
my teeth I like to use the crest 3d
white toothpaste after that I always
wash my face and today I used the clean
and clear acne control face wash the
perks of owning a waterproof camera you
can create really cool shots like that
once I'm done with all that fun bathroom
stuff I normally like to head down to
the kitchen to go make myself some
breakfast
whilst on my journey to the kitchen I
normally find my cat sitting around so I
couldn't resist to pick her up and play
with her she is the cutest and softest
cat I have ever met and I miss her so
much I also just realized how long this
cat montages I promise it's over soon on
most days I like to make smoothies for
breakfast so I am describing my
ingredients and for today I'm going to
be creating a smoothie with pineapple
banana some almond milk spinach and
frozen mangos so all I'm doing is just
combining those into my nutribullet and
blending it up
I'm just a hipster and hiding who likes
to pour her smoothies into large mason
jars just kidding but I normally do that
and then I take my vitamins vitamin
gummies are crucial for survival
then I will grab my breakfast and go
back up into my bedroom to go on my
computer at this point in time I will
normally work on schoolwork edit videos
watch youtube videos or reply to your
comments basically making the most of my
summer and living it up eventually I'll
start to get ready for whatever the day
brings me and yes I do get ready sitting
on my bed I pretty much never leave my
bed after brushing my hair I like to
moisturize and prep my face for my
makeup so lately I've been using the
Make Up For Ever HD foundation and
applying that on with a face brush after
that I like to use my dream Lumi
concealer to cover up my under-eye
circles and highlight my face I also
blend everything out with a concealer
brush
Gina blue
to set my face makeup I honestly
describe whatever face powder is closest
to me today it was my NYX blotting
powder and I'm just tapping that onto my
face with a large brush then it is time
for some bronzer so I like to lightly
contour my face with my benefit hoola
bronzer using my benefit browse the Go
Go palette I'm just filling in my
eyebrows this is such an essential step
in my makeup routine on most days I like
to use my Urban Decay Naked palette and
all I do is apply on the shade naked
into my crease then a little bit of the
lighter matte shade on to my lid I then
grab the first eyeshadow and drag it
down onto my lower lash line I almost
always like to line my eyes and create a
small wing so I'm using my Kat Von D
liquid eyeliner and doing just that
where did it go to open up my eyes I
like to use my tart inner rim liner and
apply that on to my waterline then I
finish off the eye makeup with my
benefit they're real mascara for cheeks
I've been loving this highlighting a
blush from Maybelline and all I do is
just apply it on to the tops of my
cheeks lastly I like to moisturize my
lips with my Nivea lip balm now it's
time to get dressed for the day I wish I
could wear my pajamas but that's not
very practical so let's see what's in my
closet oh my god yes a robe yes work
okay maybe not let's see what else is in
here they tell me for today's outfit I
decided to wear a grey romper from
Topshop with a brandy melville flannel
tied at the waist
for shoes I'm wearing my matte black and
shiny boots that I got from Topshop at
this point I am ready for the day I'm
ready to live my life when I realize I
don't have plans yet so I should get on
that
I love my friends so that is pretty much
how my mornings are spent during the
summer time if you guys enjoy this video
then be sure to like it and thank you so
much for watching I love you
fast and I actually got two dogs Russell
Russell is so beautiful so here's her</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
