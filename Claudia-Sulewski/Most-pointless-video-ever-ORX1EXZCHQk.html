because I was in the vlogging mood and I
said to put on my main channel because
why not have made a vlog of this channel
in a while and my hair is just not
cooperating with me today at all Andy I
just decide to do one on my main channel
I have no idea why and um yeah today I'm
having like really bad hair day so I
just kind of put up in a ponytail um so
yeah I have no idea what I'm going to be
talking about in this book so let's just
figure it out because whatever comes to
my head I'm good to speak so yeah so
basically yesterday I was recording with
my friends and um with my video camera
we went to the park it was you know it's
gonna be like a cute video you know and
then all of a sudden my camera breaks
because a little thing the lens like
fell and now it's like black and like
unfocused you can't see anything and I'm
probably gonna have to get that fixed
like professionally or whatever because
I don't know how to open that thing good
you probably is like unscrew stuff and
I'd like I knowing myself i'm just going
to break it even more so my dad is
probably i have to get that in to get
fixed which is a huge bummer because I'm
gonna have to be using this little eye
sight for a very long time and um I
don't really like this I set eyesight
thingamabob because number one it washes
me out so I look like I'm like white
like very white in this video and it
also makes me look like I'm oily and oh
my god it makes you look shiny so that's
not cool pale shiny is like not to
things that out like what it look like
oh my god it's so gross okay um so and
also like my computer fans turn on
within like two minutes and that gets
annoying um but what else I'm just going
to have to deal with it and go with it
and stuff um so yeah
that's mainly what I want to say is that
I'm gonna have to be using this because
the camera broke which really sucks dear
um c is there anything to talk about
okay i think i'm going to another one of
my friends like houses this weekend
because i'm sorry i keep going to lake
house is like every single weekend like
I just one last weekend now going this
weekend I'm so sorry because I want to
make videos but uh yeah but blah and
won't be able to make videos that we get
our upcoming weekend so yeah oh can you
hear my computer fans turning on our
nothing I say that but um yeah today
like it's just like one of those days
where it's like I didn't have a good
hair day and I am just chillin in my
hoodie and I have no idea what I'm gonna
do today I think I'm hanging out with
some friends and then oh my god I don't
feel like doing that at all I feel like
sitting home and just watching YouTube
videos oh yeah sorry this is such a
pointless video it's oh my god it's a
gritty forward 10 minutes of like random
stuff oh look at my ring I got this ring
from ex on like wings yeah oh and then
my nails are like this Goldie and it's
from well thats ok
this is the day I'll Pasha I'm wearing
it's from Sabina nail color in golden go
figure and then also assure you has
another ring that I got four packs on
looks like this it's really pretty and
this one like it pull it like goes right
to your knuckle ok this is so confusing
because like computer goes backwards
like flips and I'm not used to that but
um it looks like that it's really big
but decide to wear this one cuz I'm like
this well not too small so yeah um there
is like a two-item hall for you guys now
you can really hear the fan so my
computer I told you this is going to be
so annoying i'm so sorry no I just can't
wait to make tutorials on this thing
that's going to be fun yeah this is like
totally a pointless vlog oh my god oh ok
so my room like it might look clean
right like that looks whoops that looks
really clean right there all right right
nope firm is actually really messy but
um you guys can't see that so that's ok
because I just had a sleepover that's
why I've blankets all over the floor
yeah that's probably all that I want to
say and this was a really pointless vlog
and I'm sorry but um I really didn't
know what to do today and I felt like
flogging so I think I'm i stopped camera
and save you guys a couple minutes of
your life because this is honestly like
you're wasting your time watching this
video no kidding but um it was really
pointless so I promise I'm not my next
video is not going to be this pointless
ok so this is like my little pointless
blog of this summer or I guess yeah
