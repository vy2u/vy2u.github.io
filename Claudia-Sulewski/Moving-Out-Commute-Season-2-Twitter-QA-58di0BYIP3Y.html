cue a few hours ago I read it out to you
guys asking to send me questions with
the hashtag ask Claudia and that's what
we're going to get right into first
question comes from re Claudia in the
building disco at first growing up
dealing with things that all adults must
deal with I feel like it's a gradual
process the first phase is dealing with
chores without having someone ask you to
do them my advice for anyone who is
about to move out or they're in high
school start to do chores like putting
your dishes away doing your own laundry
grocery shopping if you have a job start
doing that stuff I becomes more of a
habit you just learn how to make it a
part of your day then you know builds
all that stuff phase they come in and
you just you just got to deal with them
don't do ask will you come pick us up
from jail that's right real quick
yesterday I got pranked by one of my
best friend's roommates
Olivia basically this past weekend my
friends drew drew and Dylan all into San
Francisco just for fun and Olivia called
me keep in mind choosing Milan right now
okay this is a really scary phone call
but um I don't know what to do because
I'm in Milan
oh yeah sure what's all what's going
down well I just got a call from a
police station that Drew and Dylan got
arrested in San Francisco is there any
way that you could call them I think
someone physically needs to go and bail
them out wait hold on what they got
arrested why they were caught you know
engaging in illegal activity not
convention for the video purposes I
believed it though okay yeah sure maybe
text me the pokey station number what do
I say do I really need to go fly out
there and drive I kind of totally fell
for it for a few seconds and then she
proceeded to inform me that she was
actually just on Instagram while
what's the 126 picture in your camera
bowl
there you go are you traveling anywhere
cool soon it's not where would you like
to go I actually am in less than 48
hours I'm flying to kawaii
you want to keep up be sure to follow me
on Twitter and Instagram because I will
be posting photos and all that good
stuff favorite show on Netflix right now
there are two shows that
I've been obsessed with lately the first
one is scandal I jumped on the train so
so late I'm only on season two but I am
thoroughly enjoying myself and I also
binge all of the newest episodes of
Riverdale I think there's seven out
right now Betty and Jughead I'm so
intuitive last time you didn't push up
right now describe the commute season
two and three words so yeah
commute season two is happening finally
we're currently in the process of
rehearsing you start shooting in two
weeks and I am so stoked
steamy adventurous heartbreaking offense
that was not one word but what's your
house in Harry Potter I've always
assumed that I would be in Gryffindor
it's a Gryffindor creepin don't whoa why
does it sound agree when I say it
Gryffindor Griffith Gryffindor haha I
don't know I took the tests that
everyone takes online judging by those
questions I ended up and slither in
which I don't even want to miss if
anything I thought I'd be like ravenclaw
do you have a crush at the moment this
has been like a reoccurring thought that
I've been having for the past few weeks
because I straight-up don't this is the
longest I've gone without having a crush
and it is so weird it is very very
difficult to meet guys out here next
question how do you stay motivated to
work out by working out with someone
else I like to stay active in three
different ways having a personal trainer
I kind of started that the beginning of
this year I also like soul cycle and so
with that you've got an instructor and
an entire class and the music is going
pumping my last option is just to go to
the gym that I have a membership at and
I go through all the time can't do room
workouts followed up with your childhood
crush Ashton Kutcher Oh what is your
go-to dance move let's set up the
situation the scenario if I'm out on the
town at a bar in the Fleur I kind of
usually do like a hip thing and just
kind of like you like a satisfied and
like my shoulders - I don't know I just
let my body go free are you planning on
getting your own apartment
yes our lease ends actually in a few
months ended June a few of us are going
our separate ways a few of us are moving
into another house I personally am ready
to live alone I just dream of the day
when I
we have my own kitchen I love interior
design so much so I solely want to live
alone to be able to experience that type
of bigger project and then also just
being able have like a clean environment
I am going to miss living with my
roommates so pretty much because they
are all incredible people do you want to
start your own clothing line I feel like
I'm never going to be the type of
youtuber to come out with my own merch
or anything like that I don't know if it
goes like that type of clothing maker I
think having a capsule collection with a
certain brand is so up the alley that I
want to experience and take on and I
actually want to bring this up to kind
of gauge your guys's interest if I ever
did wear comes something really put my
all into it and all that stuff and share
with you guys would you be down like is
that something that you guys would be
interested in I don't know because that
seems pretty damn cool to me what are
your thoughts on the law of attraction
slash manifestation oh I believe it
1000% and I participate in it that's a
really weird way to put it if you're
curious about it definitely research it
today's last question or actually more
of a demand let's do a lookbook missing
your fashion videos I know I feel like I
haven't uploaded a fashion video and so
long which pains me because I love love
fashion I'm going to be so real with you
guys the reason why I haven't done it in
a while is honestly because I am NOT 100
and happy with my body like dining
straight up the answer I have footage of
a lookbook that I started and I've been
meaning to film more clips but every
weekend I look at my body I'm like ah no
maybe next week I know it's just like a
personal thing in my head because I need
super healthy and I workout but I still
and just not happy with where I'm at and
I feel like it's going to a gradual
thing and we're working on it
oh but yeah that is like genuinely why I
go very long without posting like a
fashion video I know I missed editing
and filming those videos because they
are so much fun I need to do it I need
to I know I know
so that is it for today's Twitter Q&amp;amp;A
thank you to everyone who tweeted out
any questions as always I have so much
fun with these I hope you guys enjoy
today's video if you did give it a big
thumbs up and I will see you guys for
these be up very soon social down below

self plug at the end alright see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
