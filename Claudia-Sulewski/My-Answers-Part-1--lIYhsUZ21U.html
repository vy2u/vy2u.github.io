like entire video but the entire time I
was swinging on my chair like this and
it was bugging me so much when I was
recording so I decide to record this and
also two days ago I went to the beach
and I'm really burnt in red but this
camera washes me out so much that it
doesn't even look like I'm right at all
so that's pretty good but today I'm
going to be doing the answers video to
my questions
video and I got almost 300 comments from
you guys asking questions so thank you
so much for whoever asked me questions
and obviously I can't answer all them
but I just wrote down the ones that
seemed fun to answer and the ones that I
saw the most so I have four pages of
questions here so I'm gonna try this
quickly and I think I'm gonna have two
parts to this so I'm going to do like
two pages each video so I just want to
get right into this because otherwise
it's gonna be like half an hour long
video which I can't do okay what is your
favorite thing you're in your room
probably my computer because without it
I wouldn't be on YouTube when did you
start wearing makeup I started wearing
makeup in seventh grade but I still do
not wear it every day who do you prefer
Miley Cyrus or Katy Perry definitely
Katy Perry because overall I just love
her I she's one of my favorite artists
because I think her music is really
happy and girly and it puts a smile on
my face do you play any sports yes I
play tennis and I used to play soccer
how long did it take you to get that
many subscribers honestly I didn't have
any subscribers I had like two
subscribers but I still made videos
every day
and I guess just over time it just kind
of got like faster and more came I don't
know it's like it's hard to explain I
don't know but I've been on here for
almost two years so that's how long it
kind of took did someone inspire you to
become a beauty guru
no nobody individually inspired me I
think just overall the entire beauty
community just fascinated me and I
really want to become part of it because
I thought it was just so cool so no one
like individually what type of nail
design is your favorite to do definitely
the French manicure like with the French
tips
wearing like chipped up like gold nail
polish right now but I love having
french tips because it's very classy and
simple and it's appropriate for anything
where am i oh this is where I am what
was your best mate first Mac product my
mom gave me a lot of her Mac makeup so
she kind of passed it down to me that
but the first thing that I actually
bought for myself like I went there and
bought it was this eyeshadow and this is
steamy it's like a bluish turquoisey
eyeshadow tickly cute but it's really
bright and I don't really wear it so
that wasn't really a good choice but
it's really pretty have you ever had
black contacts braces or glasses I have
braces right now and I had them in
fourth grade and I don't wear glasses
but I do have color contacts and I'm
gonna make a video about them students
to watch out for that but I love colored
contacts how old are you I'm 14 years
old
are you a light or heavy sleeper I am
pretty much on and off because sometimes
I sleep through everything but then like
for example a thunderstorm but sometimes
I just wake up randomly from like this
like the quiet most quiet things ever so
I guess I'm kind of like on and off are
you a dog or cat person definitely a dog
person sorry for all the cat person
people up there but definitely dogs I
don't really like cats that much I'm
sorry cats
what kind of straightener do you have I
just have this regular straightener from
Conair it's like black and red and I
really like it have you ever been to
Europe nope I've never even been out of
the country so only been to America when
were you born in 1996 a piercing four
year who was the first who were the
first screws you watched probably juices
Tara seven because that's how I found
out about YouTube I saw one for videos
and then probably all that glitter still
on and Michelle Phan those were probably
the first ones I've watched next
question do you get good grades
yes grades are definitely like my main
priority during a school year so I get
usually A's and like B's are you excited
for school
all right for school to start yes I'm
super excited because I love seeing
everyone and seeing anyone changed like
I got braces and things like then people
got tar so I'm actually really excited
what's your favorite animal
definitely pandas ice to be obsessed
with them and now I'm not as obsessed as
I was before but I still really like
pandas when's your birthday my birthday
is February 19th where were you born in
America do you think cheerleading is a
sport um kind of depends because well my
hair is just really bugging me today
like I don't even know what to do with
it
I think that the cheerleading like where
you compete with other like cheerleaders
and you like fly to places to compete
and like Nationals and all that stuff I
definitely think that's a sport so
probably yeah but I don't know about
cheerleaders that just kind of cheer on
the side of a football game I don't know
all right do you watch Pretty Little
Liars or make-it-or-break-it no I do not
watch make-it-or-break-it but I do watch
Pretty Little Liars and I love that show
it's amazing but I already know the
ending of it because I googled it and I
am not happy with how the show was gonna
end up being like I don't like the
ending at all but I still love that show
um do you like coach bags I don't have
my own Coach bag but I think they're
really cute if you were stranded on the
islands that only contained water and
you could bring one thing what would it
be
be friends definitely because I think I
would go crazy and suicidal if I didn't
have someone else to talk to
because I'd get really bored so I bring
someone else with me
have you ever been to a concert if so
who's yeah I've been to a lot of
concerts I don't even remember all of
them but I've been to I think the Spice
Girls Beyonce Madonna I would say Spice
Girls like the LAT their last world tour
which was really awesome did I go to
Jennifer Lopez I think so I don't even
remember and I've been to other ones
like that aren't really that famous
they're just like groups of bands and
things like that so um I think that's it
I don't know
okay if you are in a fire and can only
carry out one thing that's not living
what would it be probably my box of
albums and photos from the past because
I think those are like really important
memories that I want to remember like I
could get a new computer or get new
clothes or get a new makeup like that I
don't think I would carry that stuff out
and it's my computer fans I'm turning on
right now so sorry about that I'm a mum
um where am i okay did you ever have
problems with other kids at school of
course there's fights and drama and
things like that but it never got too
serious to the point where like a
teacher or the principal got involved
what's your favorite color
probably purple and blue do you have
fever fever no never had it I think he's
cute and has good voice but he's kind of
girly in my opinion I'm sorry but um I
like Justin before he's not bad Team
Jacob or Team Edward definitely Jacob
because his body is amazing and I just
really like Taylor Lautner
do you watch 16 and pregnant or Teen Mom
nope none of those if you could have any
of tronic for free what would you get
the iPad because that's what I really
really want right now so I'm gonna try
and get that for Christmas do you have a
favorite fan so not really I like I like
most random music ever I like think
maybe two but then again I like Coldplay
and I like the black-eyed peas and then
I like Taylor so I don't know my sense
of like music is really strange favorite
store Target but for clothes Hollister
Victoria's Secret Abercrombie forever 21
just those kind of stuff favorite ice
cream flavors Blue Moon mint chocolate
chip coffee birthday cake I have a lot
of favorites but those are a couple of
them what's the weather like outside
right now it's sunny and it's warm and
hot and it's like just like a perfect
summer day and my hair is so crazy sorry
I always play with it okay what kind of
cell phone do you have I have the envy
touch 5 Verizon wire
and it's just like a touchscreen you
flip it in this keyboard what grade are
you going into I'm going to eighth grade
what camera do you use this is the
camera that I use the Sanyo like secti
HD 1/8 hot looks but the lens actually
broke inside and my dad's can try to fix
it so that's why my videos have been
very bad quality because I'm using my
computer so sorry about that but my
dad's probably gonna get it fixed or
he's gonna do it himself
do you have a boyfriend / have you ever
had a boyfriend yes I've had boyfriends
a boyfriend / ever and currently I do
not have a boyfriend so I'm simple do
you speak any other languages yes I
speak Polish and what's your middle name
