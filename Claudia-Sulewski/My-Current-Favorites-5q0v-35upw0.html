very dressed for this video I'm like
legit in my pajamas like I've got my
panda pants on um but basically a lot of
you guys ask and so on if I say hey
girls and then I say a lot of you guys
when I mean guys I mean like hey guys
what's up like like everyone if you guys
know I'm saying cuz so you guys are like
okay you just said hey girls and now
you're saying you guys but it's I don't
know it's weird okay getting off topic
here so a lot of you are asking for me
to do those like monthly favourites
videos and the thing is I would love to
do those but um I don't really go
shopping that much like at all and I
constantly use like the same exact
products every single month so i don't
really switch around like my routine or
anything like that so if i made a
monthly video favorites video every
single month month showing you guys new
things that i'm loving I would be lying
because I use a lot of the same things
so today I'm just going to do an
all-over favorites video so I think
that's what I'm going to be doing as I
start collecting more things that I've
been loving I'll just make it all over
favourites videos so this video is going
to be kind of all over the place because
I'm gonna tell you guys about a couple
of fashion things that I've been loving
make up things random things and music
too and I like wrote them all down right
here so I know exactly what to stay
focused on because I can get a little
off topic and stuff so first I'm going
to start out with just makeup lately
i've been loving this bronzer and this
is from Too Faced and this is like the
chocolate so I no idea of how to
pronounce that yet and that's not good
but it's just a bronzer and it looks
like this and i'm actually going to make
a
review / like tutorial on how I apply on
bronzer about this bronze I because i
love it so much and so I've just got a
text message but i will be making a
video about this bronzer soon and it's
from to face and it smells like
chocolate how amazing is that I've been
using this every day since I got it so
another thing that I've been loving is
this beauty rush body mist and I don't
know if you guys know but I am a major
fan of these beauty rush like little
body mist things which I don't really
have that many but I always on the store
and like spare myself with it or like
steal them from my friends but this is
in the smell juste berry and it is very
powerful but it smells like berries and
cranberry juice and sugar and honestly I
say never love like sweet sweet scents
but now it's like I can't stand them
like that's how much I love them so I've
been spreading this on every day and
looks like I barely used any of it which
is weird because I like coat myself in
this stuff it smells so good and I would
just wear this ever do to school and I
keep this in my backpack and this is
like the mini size it can get for six
dollars like near the cash register at
least that's how it is like in our
stores that are set up so this was like
six dollars and they have like a new
formula and this is like the mini one so
I just keep this in my backpack ice play
before school and then right after
school I'll give like one spray on my
neck right here and I'll put in my
backpack and yeah so loving this stuff
you guys have no idea how much I love
that another thing that I've been liking
is so about nail polishes lately I've
been not now polishing my nails I don't
know I just like don't have the time for
it but I've been like I guess I don't
have the time for it but it's like I
don't know it's really hard to explain
but for toenails I used to be obsessed
with white toenails my toenails would
always be white um no matter what I was
wearing no matter what like I would just
recoding them I've been wearing I think
had white toenails for at least one year
straight yeah um that's just how I am
like my toenails toenails are always the
same color and I finally decided to
switch my color and now i'm using this
little baby pink and this is wet and
wild mega laughs sorry this is like old
so it's like can you even see it barely
and this isn't true love and the cult I
mean this camera doesn't really pick up
very well but it's like a Barbie pink
like a baby pink and it's super light so
it makes my feet look kind of tan by the
to contrast or the colors like you know
how white makes you look Tanner and that
kind of stuff probably really liking
this it's very girly and it's like a
very soft color so I've been loving this
on my toes and another thing that I've
been loving is the coastal scents 88
palette I know I made a review that our
view started tutorial with this palette
but I love these colors i think i've
used maybe like i haven't used like five
of these otherwise I views all them
maybe not like the gray ones but the
brown ones I use all of them like
everyday I would just make up a new like
little look with all these different
color Browns um I don't know it's just
amazing like I really love these bottom
ones are here for the crease and I like
these up here for the lid or the sparkly
ones are really fun too I don't know I
just really like this talent you can
create so many different looks with this
so i definitely encourage you guys to
check out this palette if you're just
beginning with makeup this is super
great for just like neutral looks and
that's it for my little makeup thing
because you know i don't really buy a
lot of makeup so it's kind of like the
same stuff um so now with the whole
fashion and clothes and stuff i'm just
going to talk about pants right now so
the weather where I live is getting
super crazy and one day it's hot one day
it's freezing cold it's weird but lately
i've been wearing a lot of long pants
I've been starting to wear them and I am
acid OOP up to do we I mean I'm
completely in love with Victoria's
Secret
like material long pants and my favorite
style if you guys are big fans of
victoria secret you know that they have
styles like yoga pants and like the like
half ones or that like roll up and
they're like time in the bottom but my
favorite style or are I like can't talk
today I'm sorry my favorite style are
the boyfriend pants I just got an email
sorry and the boyfriend pants are
basically where they're like baggy pants
these are my friend pants oh shoot I
have low battery hold on a second um
well then I just kind of Texas person
back BRB okay and basically what's
different about the boyfriend pants is
there really baggy and at the bottom you
can cut them like so like you can cut to
the link that you want and also on the
but they have like this really weird
stitching that you can't really see in
the sliding but I don't know it's hard
to explain its like a triangle I don't
know but um I really like these pants
and these are the ones that have a
little piece on them I don't know am I
definitely to get more of these though
because I love it so much they're so
comfy and yeah and another style that
I've been loving is I don't know what
these are called I can't find any of
them on the internet and I could never
find them in stores anymore and these
aren't yoga pants which I've been
wanting so badly I want to get the yoga
pants really bad because those are so
comfortable these are kind of similar
and kind of low if you guys know the
style of these pants because I have no
idea um we're basically they fold at the
top like yoga pants and then they're
really long they're like they're like
semi-tight unlike the thighs in the
knees and then they're like a really big
loose on the bottom so they're not is
tight and stretchy as yoga pants but
they're tighter than for example like
boyfriend pants so I'd like these gray
ones and then also I have these pink
ones which look like this and then they
say pink down the middle which I think
these are adorable they're so
comfortable and all my friends are like
oh my god
they all want to get them and they're
like can't find them anywhere and I
can't find them either and that's really
sad because I really want to get more of
those I don't know that my mom has a
green pair so I'm definitely probably
going to get those from her once i get
taller and like longer legs and stuff
but yeah i've been loving those two
style of pants from victoria's secret
and now on to more random things that
i've been liking side this views all
over the place and it's so long so hurry
up i've been loving these little
critters calcium gummy bears with
vitamin d they're just really good and
you know you need your vitamins every
day and these are like swirly and
different colors and just chewy and
really delicious and you meet to a day
and they're just so good I just can't
stop eating them and every day I like
I'm looking forward to the day hiding to
the time where I get to eat these I eat
them in the morning but these are so
good I love them and you can get them at
Trader Joe's ok also I've been loving
gum which i think i always love gum I'm
like a really huge fan of gum I love
chewing it I love the taste and stuff
and lately I've been loving this extra
long-lasting flavor gum and this is a
polar ice it which is a minty I only
like minty gum I mean I like fruity but
fruity light goes away and I'd rather
have minty gum that fruity I mean minty
breath and fruity breath and this is
polar ice which makes your mouth feel
like hold and just amazing so I've been
loving these I get like that the ones
that come with i three packs and i just
picked these up at walgreens because it
was like the cheapest set of three packs
of gum and i ended up loving these so
now i'm like addicted to this come and i
eat it like every day or two it another
thing that i've been loving is puppy
chow if you guys know that is it's like
check mix cereal and you drizzle like
melted chocolate and like peanut butter
and butter and vanilla and then you coat
it with what's it called powdered sugar
and
they are so good i have like nine cups
of it downstairs in my kitchen and nine
cups of it is a lot and i'm just
obsessed with that stuff you guys don't
know what it is you can just google the
recipe and make it it's super simple and
it's really really good so it's also a
fun thing to do with your friends like I
made them with my friends and stuff so
those are really good so I have one last
category of my overall favorites and
thank goodness this video is under 15
minutes because that's where I have to
keep it and my next little category is
music lately I've been loving that kind
of like like my like variety of music
that I like listening to is really crazy
because I like techno songs some of them
are really good I like like blink-182 I
like rap I like Eminem I like black eyed
peas then I like Taylor Swift and
Coldplay and then I like Moby songs to
like it's it's really weird I'd like
Madonna songs to like I think I like
every type of music except Roy death
metal but I know I told you guys that
before but lately i've been loving that
kind of like cool like mellow music and
then also like the very soft and like
Coldplay like kind of saddish like it
could be like breakup music if you're
like broke up with a guy or whatever
it's like the perfect songs to listen to
um but I've been just loving those songs
because it like it just like makes you
feel like relaxed and cool so I three
songs three songs to tell you guys and I
definitely encourage you guys to listen
to them so first one is island in the
sun and it's by weezer and that's more
of the like whole like beachy cool like
mellow music I can't really show you
guys because otherwise they'd be
copyrighted but I've been loving that
song lately it's so amazing it's also an
aquamarine if you guys might be able to
recognize it it's an amazing song I
definitely encourage you guys to type it
up in YouTube up there and then two
other songs I've been liking which are
actually from Coldplay and I don't know
if a lot of you guys would like
kind of music but it's kind of like slow
mellow like good music to listen to
before you go to bed or if you're
feeling sad or happy so the first one is
a message by Coldplay I've been loving
that and then also i've been loving
prospects march which is also really
good those two are like really slow
songs that are really easy to listen to
and that's it for my little favorites
video sorry this video was like
everywhere and so I for the lack of
videos but i'll see you guys for another
one hopefully soon yeah so i'll see you
guys in another video which is exactly
what i just said so before i start like
