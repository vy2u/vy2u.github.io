channel we are so confident courtesy of
my vlog sack I'm having a great time as
well as the coffee bags is chugged
today's video is going to be a Q&amp;amp;A
because I am actually heading to Mexico
tomorrow morning so I had one day to
film and edit something and that's why
we're here and we're doing this instead
of doing a Twitter Q&amp;amp;A like I normally
do I decided to bring it over to
Instagram this time so I posted a little
photo and asked you guys to comments any
questions and 1,328 of you had some
banaz that's great thank you guys so
much
the number one question I've been
getting from you guys asks what living
alone is like because this is my first
time living in my own place specifically
how do you feel about living in your own
how is it adjusting what's the best and
worst part about so far so previous to
this I live in a house with three other
people for two years very social very
fun environment I think now I'm in a
place in my life where I'm always
running around doing so many different
errands and going in and out of house
log my work it actually involves being
at home so I personally was just very
ready to live on my own and be able to
come to a place that is quiet and clean
and no distractions and stuff like that
let's start off with the worst part
oh I haven't really visited at this
point yet and I feel like essentially
one of the worst things will be like if
I go see a horror movie at a movie
theater the fact that I could go home
alone and I don't get to go home with
like my best friends that is going to be
creepy I've been just staying
accountable for keeping your place clean
because everything is your
responsibility like if there's dishes in
the sink
those are your dishes no one else would
those in their best part blasting music
got the entire house it's so nice to you
it's like cook in the kitchen and run up
in my room and whatever and just have
music constantly playing all day because
I pretty much start playing music the
second I wake up it's actually what
helps me like stay motivated and then
also being in control of what your place
looks like what your place feels like
the vibes are just damn good in this
place I wanted to make sure that that
was like a huge thing that I said in
personally right away when I was out
here I'm like yeah let's get you some
let's live a good life let's have a good
day what's your best tip for making your
dreams come true I feel like it's a
combo of not doubting yourself do not
doubt your ability so much of it is just
working hard and being consistent that
the combination of focusing are what
your smaller goals are first because you
can't really tackle a giant large goal
like you need to start with little
things that eventually would lead to
that kiss marry or slap drew Lucas and
Stefan I'm gonna really think about this
one oh well I would definitely slap
Lucas because I feel like you'd be into
it are mery second because duh and then
I would kissed you because I loved you
when is the new season of the commute
coming out um the day that I'm gonna be
uploading this actually the first two
episodes will already be out so a link
both of them down below
but you guys I'm so freaking excited for
you guys to see this season because we
worked so long and hard on this and I'm
so proud of it I think it's acute a
story ever and it pulls at your
heartstrings but it's funny and it's
just oh my god there's 12 episodes there
on awesomeness TV two times a week every
Tuesday and Thursday and yeah I really
hope you guys enjoy it also when the
season is completely over I've got a
super long bloopers video for you guys
so I'm excited for you guys to do that
too so who's your favorite artist slash
fans and what is your favorite song by
them Luis del Mar you guys already know
I'm so annoying about it but if you
haven't seen my last video I went to
barber Rock which is a music festival in
Napa and I found a little travel diary
anyways you see me just living life to
the fullest
watching Musso Mar live and yeah my
favorite song by name is probably malt
liquor favorite movie and why last night
I watched a movie called I think it's
the place behind the pines a place
behind the pine so freakin good it was
so dark and beautiful but sad and just
rich oh my god they're just one part
where like Ryan Gosling is driving down
a motorcycle in the middle of the woods
and the song is playing and then towards
the end in movie you see his kid riding
down a bike with a similar song it could
be the same song and a similar Road and
you just like guess yeah I cheered up a
few times do you have any big projects
for 2017 oh boy
I'm going to be filming a few things
this summer I can mention that tag
seasons are you happening we've got some
other stuff happens as well goo girl is
also creating something / directing such
is it a couple years ago you talked
about being the person you want to be in
the future and developing habits that
person would have to still motivate you
what is your main motivation right now I
like to have length the video where I
talk about that because that is one of
my favorite I think is a blog I even
personally watch back on it sometimes
when I kind of forget or lose that
motivation but I definitely think about
that quite often I think at this point
my biggest sort of motivation is
continuing with that streak because I
know how good and how proud I feel when
I do and so at the top of my to-do list
I will literally write like be the
person that you are today or like it's a
new day make it beautiful
I'm the cheesiest person ever but it
works for me what is your dream
boyfriend okay okay let's think about
this one real quick
appearance-wise I always say they like
brunettes but then I somehow always end
up dating blondes but like I don't think
I have a type I think my biggest thing
is just like oral hygiene or just like
in general hygiene I also like guys to
know how to dress themselves
appropriately you know a very obvious
and very very important thing for me is
like finding someone who is equally as
motivated and passionate in whatever
they do I don't care what they do but
like I have been in relationships before
where the relationship would over
consume my other partner does sucking me
in and the point of our relationship is
for two individuals to share that not be
come back and so I'm like very very much
about like making sure that I'm not
stopping myself in my career and all
that stuff I love to see just not even
riding for a relationship like I didn't
have enough time like for myself I'm
literally in a relationship with myself
right now
and my job but yeah besides that I mean
I feel like this is all cliche but like
the basics of just being a genuine
person who is kind respectful respects
himself a little sides of humor never
hurt nobody
I feel like I'm like The Bachelorette
right now being like I want
I want that I was on that but no I don't
stress about that stuff at all because I
just trust that like the right person
will come starting the focus on that you
feel pressure to keep a squeaky clean
reputation and fighting against it to
actually just be clean really are I
think once you have that realization of
there is no need to have to defend
yourself to anyone you don't owe anyone
anything and whatever you're doing you
should be doing because it makes you
happy
they make you proud as a person then
like you're set you're good what would
you like to change in this world
I wish people's concerns for this
environment and this planet would
increase like that one which is our
president right Donald Trump is there a
food that most people like but you don't
like it all yeah
in and out everyone is obsessed in and
out out here and I honestly think it's
gross and make me feel gross they're
like $1 burgers thank you guys so much
for watching today's video that's going
to be it I would see you guys for a new
one next week and I love you all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
