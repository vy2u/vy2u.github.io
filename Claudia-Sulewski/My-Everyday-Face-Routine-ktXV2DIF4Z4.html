asked me what I use to wash my face and
my everyday face routine and I did make
one before my channel got hat and so
that one got deleted so I decided that
I'm gonna be doing this video that video
today obviously from the title and
honestly I've been using the same exact
products since that last video except I
use something different to moisturize my
face so I use three products this and
I'm gonna go into detail about all of
them this this and this so two of them
are Burt's Bees for one of them is from
L'Oreal so first on the start up with my
face wash I wash my face at least once a
day so I'd rather do it like in like
before night time like before bedtime I
usually wash wash my face and then
sometimes in the morning I'm just kind
of lazy and just kind of don't do it but
this is what I wash my face with and
this is the Burt's Bees soap bark and
don't know how to pronounce this you
guys like killed me last time I couldn't
pronounce this Jamo meal
chamomile well it's the Burt's Bees soap
and bark chamomile deep cleansing cream
and it looks like this and this is what
I used to wash my face so I just / warm
water into my face and then I just take
a little bit of this and it's white and
all you do is just take about like this
much honestly you don't need anything
and moisturize it and like rub it into
your skin and the different thing about
this is it's a cleansing cream so it
doesn't bubble up and like soap up or
whatever so the consistency doesn't
really change so when you just apply it
onto your face like then it starts
working on its own so what I do is I put
it onto my face and just let it sit on
my face for a little bit and then I'll
go ahead and wash it off and of course
like I rub it in
stuff and let me tell you guys when you
that like when you put this on your face
like you don't want to wash it off
that's how amazing it feels like that's
exactly what I said in my last video but
it feels so good like your face feels
not tingly and when when you go like
this and you like put like air to your
face it gets all like hold and it feels
amazing oh my god
and the smell of this so that's exactly
like lemon lollipops
it's like you know like the lollipops
that come in like the clear packaging
and it's like they're not really upper
and they're just kind of like lemon
lollipops this is exactly what it smells
like and it smells so good and I love it
and I will never stop using this because
it works amazingly and it won't clog
your pores and what else it penetrates
and cleanses removing dirt makeup and
excess oil for clean and healthy skin so
love this then to get so that's just
overall I get my face to look less red
and just like even skin tone and cleaned
and whatever and the way that I remove
my acne like if I ever have a pimple or
is it or whatever I use this and this is
definitely one of my best friends this
is the Burt's Bees natural acne
solutions spot treatment and this is I
know this bottle is puny and it was like
ten bucks oh this one was like seven or
eight dollars i'm not sure i got at
walgreens though you can get all these
on walgreens this was ten dollars if
this little thing is ten dollars you
know that it has to be at least somewhat
good um and it's just yellow you guys
can see that and it's a little glass
bottle and basically what i do is i only
use this before nighttime and I don't
use this every day because it's so
expensive but that's how like the little
tip coat looks and what you do is you
take this is what I do you take an ear
cleaner or whatever you place it at the
top and then you tip it and this absorbs
it and then you just dot your face and
just apply it on to all of your zits and
pimples and honestly I'm telling you
guys by the next day by morning all of
mine are gone it depends on like how
like big your acne is not big but like
if you guys say
like I don't get acne that much so it's
like when I put it on the next morning
it's gone so at least either you're
gonna see an improvement or it's gonna
be gone because this stuff is freakin
amazing
oh my gosh I love it so much it
completely just removes and makes my
zits disappear which is amazing because
yeah I really like it
I'll only con about this is that it
smells really bad like I I don't think
it smells really bad but it just smells
very powerful so I don't know if some of
you would be able to deal with that like
and sometimes it stings a little when
you put it on some pimples um and just
the overall like smell is like really
strong so I don't know you guys will
like that um so basically what I do so
far is I just at nighttime I'll wash my
face and then I'll use this and then
that's it for nighttime and I'll just
fall asleep with this and stuff like
that I don't only moisturize my face
that much but what I use for my
moisturizer and um I said at morning
time so when I wake up I'll use just
this if I do ever end up washing my face
in the morning because sometimes I will
admit that I get lazy so I'll use this
in the morning and then for my
moisturizer I use a L'Oreal new sublime
glow for face daily moisturizer and this
is like a tanning lotion sorta so oh
it's a skin tone enhancer and this is
for medium skin tones so I like using
this during the summer because if I ever
like would say I went to the beach and I
got tan on face I'll use this right away
and this will just like darken up the
look and just enhance your natural like
summer glow and stuff so that's what
says get a healthy summer glow and it
also has SPF SPF 15 in here so that's
pretty great and I'm pretty sure that
L'Oreal tests on animals which sucks but
yeah I don't think Burt's Bees does does
it comment below if you guys know but
I'm gonna be really upset if they do it
because Burt's Bees is like definitely
one of my favorite companies ever but
anyway so I use this in the more
oh my god my nails match to the bottle
so I will use this in the morning and it
looks like that it's just like a yellowy
like white and then I just kind of
moisturize it everywhere do not forget
any spots because that would be bad
because this is a tanning lotion so
that's what I would use and yeah that's
it for the three products that I use for
my face so it's not that much but
definitely recommend these two oh my
gosh especially this one well and this I
don't know you guys should really check
out these because they're really amazing
so you can get everything at Walgreens
that's where I got everything I've been
doing this like forever I don't think
I'm ever gonna change my base routine
because I don't know I love it so much
like it's working for me I might as well
keep going and um since you barely have
to use anything for this I still have so
much left in here like it sounds like it
might be empty but I'm like squishing
this stuff right now like there's
there's a lot in here the only thing is
I'm scared when I'm gonna run out of
this because this is expensive but yeah
I'm just dragging this on way too long
so thank God I'm surprised this wasn't
like over ten minutes but um yeah that's
it for my everyday face routine on how I
get my face to be acne clear and it
because you're wondering I am not
wearing any makeup on my face at all I'm
just wearing like mascara that's it so
yeah I'll see you guys for another video
hope you guys enjoyed it and I'll see
you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
