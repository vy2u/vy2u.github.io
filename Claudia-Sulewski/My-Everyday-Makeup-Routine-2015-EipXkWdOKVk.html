am so excited about today's video
because you guys request it so often and
I feel like I haven't made one of these
in a very long time but today I'm going
to be showing you guys what I'll do it
to my face every single day okay my
everyday makeup routine so I hope you
guys enjoyed today's video and keep on
watching to see my makeup routine whew I
always start off with priming my face
and I'm using my benefit Porefessional
primer and just applying that all over
for a foundation I'm using my Make Up
For Ever Ultra HD in the shade 375 Y 375
and I know it looks a little orange in
this lighting but I promise you guys
this is the one this is the shade that
works best with my skin tone and I just
blend it with a Beauty Blender now it's
time to highlight I like to use my
Maybelline instant age rewind concealer
and I apply it underneath my eyes my
forehead my nose Cupid's bow chin and
lately I've been doing it right above my
jawline which I find that really helps
kind of add structure to my jaw is that
correct I don't know but I blend it with
the Beauty Blender again of course you
got to set your face with some powder
I'm using my Mac powder in the shade and
medium plus my Jessica breath away for
eyebrows I like to use two different
products so I start off with my steal a
brow pencil in the shade dark brown and
I basically just create the shape I find
that it's so much easier to use a pencil
for this step and after that I want to
make it a little bit darker so I go in
with my benefit browsing palette in the
darkest shade and I just fill in my
eyebrows then my favorite part
contouring I love contouring so much I
think it changes the entire look
and in my case it adds like four years
on to my face so I'm just applying on
that in those places yes
now I'm moisturizing my lips for
eyeshadow you guys know that I've been
loving my buxom palette so first off I
am grabbing the topi light brown color
and I'm just buffing it into my crease
and all over my lid
next up I'm using the darker Brown and
applying this to the outer half of my
eyes and bringing it up into the crease
and once I do that I grab a fluffy brush
and just blend everything out
I also drag that same eyeshadow down
into the lower lashline and buff it out
for eyeliner I have always been a fan of
the Kat Von D tattoo liquid liner so I'm
just creating a fairly dramatic wing and
a little bit on the upper lash line and
then I also drag a little bit onto the
lower lash line to kind of balance out
the eye makeup look that's what it looks
like at the moment I'm using benefits
they're real mascara but this is
definitely the product that changes up
the most in my routine just kind of
depending on whatever I want to use but
yeah after that I'm going to apply on
some blush I've been obsessed with
peaches by Mac for the past like four
months and this is actually my favorite
part of the makeup I feel like it really
kind of adds life back into your face
and color and stuff and then lastly some
lipstick I have been loving the buxom
lip foundation in the shade undressed so
cute applying it to the lips you guys
know the drill
so that is all that I do to my face when
I choose to go outside and live life and
and wear makeup while I'm at it I hope
you guys enjoyed today's video and if
you did please give it a big thumbs up
to let me know and comment down below
