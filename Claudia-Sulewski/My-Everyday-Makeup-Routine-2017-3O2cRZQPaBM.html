which is oh so exciting
today I'm going to be showing you guys
my everyday makeup routine disclaimer I
don't do this to my face every day if
I'm going to film a video yeah I'm going
to go with my friends sure what you're
about to see is pretty much what goes
down in the bathroom so okay let's do
this let's get started
I am grabbing my makeup for ever ultra
HD foundation in the shade 120 and just
applying that all over my face and
blending it with my Real Techniques
Beauty sponge when applying only one
shade all over your face you start to
lose those natural highlights and
shadows so I'm kind of going in and
recontouring my face with this Benefit
Cosmetics play stick in the shade of
jumprope it is so good so creamy so
blendable all obsessed with it right now
so I'm just subtly applying it to the
sides of my nose my temples tops my
forehead the cheekbones really hit in
all those spots I have found the best
way to blend this stuff is with the same
Beauty sponge that I was using
previously it's kind of helped melt and
blend into my foundation that sounds
really weird melt now I am setting my
face with my Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder starting off with
underneath my eyes I'm just packing it
in to really lock that stuff in place
because that's where it tends to glide
around the most and then I like to do a
subtle baked it's what I like to call
underneath my cheekbones so basically
I'll apply the product and then just
start setting the rest of my face and
eventually it blend it all in so I'm
only doing it for a few minutes we're
not going crazy here but just a little
bit to highlight that area so as you can
see I'm just blending all that in and
then the eyebrows my favorite part I'm
using browsing by benefits and just
filling it in with an angled brush I
prefer powdered products for eyebrows I
think it's just easier blend and
it's not as harsh for eyeshadow I've
been really obsessed with these Smashbox
cover shot soft light eye palette and
I'm going in with one of the lighter
kind of pinky air shades and applying it
all over my lids I find that it's very
soft and girly and subtle then we're
going to mix the darker shades and throw
those into the crease and for me it's
all about just blending and making sure
that there are no harsh lines and it's
very soft I'm also bringing it that same
shade down into my lower lash line to
kind of balance everything out rather
than dealing with liquid eyeliner gel
all that stuff I like to create a slight
wing with just an angled brush and any
black eyeshadow it is so much easier to
control it's softer and quicker I'm also
applying it to my lower lash line and
that I love this method it's oh just
trade so much easier no stress curling
my lashes my eyes are watering up as per
usual and now I am applying on mascara
my favorite is benefits with roller lash
those can we talk and also I apparently
can't apply on mascara either too sweet
have that up a little bit the eyes are
done we're on the homestretch now we're
just adding those final details that
just make you go oh damn I look good so
we're putting on some bra I can't I'm
gonna loosen I'm putting in some bronzer
and I like the hoola bronzer from
benefit you guys know and then I'm using
this pro sculpting duo from makeup
forever but I'm actually using it as
blush because I think it's the perfect
peachy color I don't know I love it I've
been using it for so long now and then
to highlight I am using my Becca
highlighter in the shade moonstone also
quick tip if you're not into over lining
your lips because I just know thank you
I like to highlight my Cupid's bow
because it really pronounces that area
and kind of helps touch light and I just
find that it ties everything in I'm
literally talking about a Cupid's bow
right now but it just makes you look
look more flirty and cute and all that
good stuff now for lips we're actually
going to take two steps we're going wild
today
started off with a buxom lick Foundation
and applied that on as a base and then
I'm just lightly tapping on this MAC
lipstick and comes a nude it helps to
kind of lighten up the shade I love a
good light nude and then lastly to
finish everything off so I'm using my
bow shaft
facial setting makeup spray it feels so
refreshing and that is it guys that is
what I do when I am really trying to go
all out so that is it for today's video
I hope you guys enjoyed it if you did
