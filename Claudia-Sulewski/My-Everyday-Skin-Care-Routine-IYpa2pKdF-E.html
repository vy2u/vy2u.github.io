showing you guys my everyday skincare
routine so I'm basically going to be
talking about what facial cleanser I use
what moisturizer and all that good stuff
so yeah so before I get into my routine
I quickly just want to tell you guys a
little bit about my skin so my skin
isn't oily but it isn't dry like
sometimes it has dry spots and then
sometimes it gets oily right here so I
guess I'm kind of normal but like
combination at the same time so I'm not
really this or that but I don't know and
also I don't get that much acne like I
normally just get little ones like on my
nose and on my chin and like down here
sometimes but every now and then I'll
get like a big pimple like right there
or like I don't know so I don't really
get that much acne but I still do get it
so that's a little bit of information on
my skin and now we'll actually get into
the routines so first I'm going to talk
about what I do at nighttime and then in
the morning so before I wash my face I
usually take a makeup remover cleansing
toilet unless I run out then I skip this
step but I've been using the Neutrogena
a night calming lights in the purple
packaging it looks like this and I love
this stuff because it has a really
common smell it's not irritating or
anything sometimes these makeup remover
wipes can be kind of harsh on my skin or
can leave it like kind of red and stuff
but sorry but this is actually really
nice I think it's great for sensitive
skin and I definitely recommend this
stuff so that's what I use first so once
I'm done wiping off all my makeup then I
get into washing my face with my
cleanser and I use the one from Burt's
Bees so all the skin care products that
I use are from Burt's Bees because it is
seriously such a great company they do
not test on animals all of them are at
least like 95% natural it always says on
the bottom how much percent natural they
are and they just work really really
well for me I've been using Burt's Bees
products for such a long time now this
is actually my second bottle of this
a little bit left in here but I love
this stuff so this is the Burt's Bees
natural acne solutions purifying gel
cleanser and it looks like this and what
I do is since it is natural it doesn't
like lather as much as other ones do so
what I do is like pour a little bit in
my palm and then I rub back between my
hands and then I like working my face
so that's how it best works for me but I
love this stuff so much and this is from
the acne solutions line which I really
like so if my acne isn't that bad then I
would just stop there and go to sleep
but if I do have like any big pimples or
sits anywhere on my face then I use the
Burt's Bees natural acne solutions spot
treatment and I've been using this for a
while too now and I'm actually running
really low on this but it's just like a
yellow liquid kind of and when you open
it it looks like this and what you do is
you just try get it on your like pimples
and zits and stuff and by morning time
they are like gone well if not there no
spli it's starting to go away but this
stuff works really well and I
occasionally use it when I have a lot of
acne and yes so if I do do this then I
just go to bed and that's all that I do
at my time so then in the morning I wake
up and I always take a shower I don't
know why but for some reason when I wake
up I've always had to take a shower I
don't wash my hair every day but I do
have to like wash my body everyday just
because I hate feeling like dirty so
every morning in the shower is that I
wash my face because it only makes sense
to wash in the shower
and I like using the Burt's Bees deep
cleansing cream which looks like this
and this stuff is 97% natural and I
really like this it's like well first of
all it smells like lemon lollipops which
is amazing oh my gosh I love this smell
so much um but it's basically like a
white cream and what you do is just kind
of pump some out and then like rub it on
your face and then I like to leave it on
my face for at least like
thirty seconds and when it goes on her
face it gets all tingly and fresh
feeling and that's why I like using this
in the morning because it really helps
kind of wake me up because I'm super
tired in the mornings and yeah it's
really nice so I'm just leave it on my
skin and then I don't know just wait and
then I'll rinse off my face and you'll
feel really like fresh and awake and
stuff like that so we really really like
this and yeah so then once I get out of
the shower I like to moisturize my face
and before I got the product that I'm
about to show you guys I hated facial
moisturizer it's like I hated that
feeling of putting lotion on your face
and then your face kind of felt all like
sticky and like gross feeling you know
this thing but I recently purchased this
moisturizer right here and I loved it so
much because it soaks into your skin so
quickly so you don't have like that
weird kind of sticky feeling and oh my
gosh I just love this stuff so much so
this is the Burt's Bees daily
moisturizing cream and this is from the
sensitive line which i think is their
newest skincare line so this is great
for people with sensitive skin I only
have good things to say about this
product honestly the packaging of it is
really awesome it goes like this and
then you just push down and it squirts
out like that so it's super convenient
when you pump it out it doesn't like
pump out a bunch and then that you end
up wasting a lot of product it's super
controlled you can pump out as much as
you want stuff so I love the patch
packaging of this and yeah this is like
$15 which is pretty expensive but I
definitely can see why it's $13 because
it is super amazing and a little was a
long way with this product so that is it
for my routine as you can see it's very
simple and straightforward and nothing
too crazy but yeah I love it I love
Burt's Bees so much like I can't even
describe how much I love it so that is
it for today's video and I am Q guys
enjoyed it and that's it okay bye
