channel I'm really excited to be filming
this because a a bunch of you guys have
requested this video so thank you for
that and B I am obsessed with talking
about skincare I think it is the
foundation to having clean healthy clear
skin and for the past year I've been
focusing so hard on what products works
best for my skin and I am the happiest
I've ever ever been with my skin which
is awesome and amazing so I'm very
excited to talk about the things that
I've put on my face also before we get
started I quickly want to give a very
very large big THANK YOU to Konig for
sponsoring today's video if you guys
want any of my favorites any of my
videos where I talk about skincare I
literally freaked out about Clinique
skin care products I'm obsessed and so
when they reached out you could only
imagine I threw up all over the floor no
I didn't but like that is kind of how I
felt in my brain because I like to
pamper my face I use a lot of different
products so I wanted to categorize this
video into different sections because
obviously we don't have time to use a
face mask every single day so the way
that I'm going to be explaining my
skincare routine is through which steps
are most important here are all the
categories that we'll be talking about
and kind of what products I use under
that category
taking off the makeup let's talk about
that real quick taking off your makeup
at nighttime has got to be the most
crucial important and vital step to your
skincare routine it does not matter what
situation I'm in or how tired I am i
100% always take my make off before
going to bed I can't even think about
having that fit on there that is no
that's a big no-no and you have all that
on your face you need to take it off
with a makeup cleanser and pre cleanse
so then you're able to use your actual
face wash and let that do its actual job
of cleaning your skin it's kind of like
jumping into the shower with your
clothes on you know you just you don't
do that to take off my makeup every
single day I have been using two
products specifically the first one
has been my Holy Grail this is the
clinic take the day off cleansing balm
let me just show you guys a little goes
a long way with this stuff and I have
legitimately carved my way through this
thing this thing is last to be so long
the way that this stuff works is very
fascinating I want to show you guys but
we take the day off cleansing balm is
basically a lightweight makeup cleanser
that goes from balm to oil to milk
melting off all of your makeup so what
I'll do is just dip my fingers in grab
some products kind of swish it around
start massaging it into my face and
right away you'll see the products start
melting into an oil and it's breaking
down all of that makeup and so while
you're taking off all that makeup it's
actually starting the process of
nourishing your skin it's going to leave
it fresh not greasy and once you work
your way all the way in then you just
rinse off your face and so the oil will
turn into like a milky lightweight
texture and the best part is that this
stuff gets through everything you could
be wearing a dark black smokey eye a
contoured base it will get rid of all of
it and also personally I would prefer
makeup cleansers like this where I'm not
really wasting makeup wipes every day
this is just super easy it's greater for
the environment so if you guys are in
need of a makeup cleanser I can't even
stress how much I recommend this one you
can purchase it at any Sephora near you
for $29 of course I'll have all the
links below all the info and stuff will
be down there so that's pretty much what
I start off with every night now if I
didn't wear any makeup and I'm just
trying to take off any dirt or oils off
of my face I also like to use my cellar
water I've been obsessed with this stuff
it's very easy very quick but a bing
bada boom I've tried on my seller water
from multiple different brands and right
now I'm using the Bioderma micellar
water for sensitive skin and so all
that'll do is just squirt them onto a
face cotton round and then just wipe
everything off so after that you have to
wash the face and I just have one face
wash that I've honestly been using for
too long I don't even know it is the
birth B's soap bark and chamomile deep
cleansing cream I tried this out back in
like middle school and it's always just
been the products that I've just come
back to all their products are super
natural it's 99.9% natural what's the
point one I don't know
because the cleansing cream don't be
alarmed if there are no suds you just
squeeze them onto your fingertips rub it
in rinse it off you're good to go
our next category is moisturizer and
serum this I do every single morning
every single night after washing my face
I like to use two different products I
talked about all these things so many
freakin time so first I'll just use one
pump of the old Henriksen truth serum
collagen booster smells like oranges
smells amazing it soaks into your skin
30 seconds after you put it on I'm all
about having lightweight stuff I don't
want to take anything off my face I've
genuinely found a difference in my skin
after using this so this has become a
staple immediately I don't even know
where to begin with this with this one
right here
hi if you guys have never seen this
before this is the dramatically
different moisturizing gel from Clinique
if I could give birth to a face product
it would be this one it'd be painful for
sure I forgot when I first tried this
stuff but I remember specifically this
products changing the game for me I
personally like the gel over the lotion
because as you guys know I like to keep
things light weight on my face I don't
even use a makeup primer this is
straight up my makeup primer in the
morning I just throw this on and then
wait two minutes and start putting on my
makeup it's like a wonder product that
just makes your skin look incredible
amazing I need to stop talking about it
our last and final category is face
masks and extras so basically like the
extra credit products or bonus points if
I have extra time I'm feeling saucy I
want to treat myself so what I've shown
you so far I use every single day every
morning every night these are the things
that I use when I have time or if I have
a specific problem area or something
comes up to talk about face masks real
quick because we all love face masks
they're amazing they've become a huge
trend in the last like two years as far
as sheet masks go the brand kind of
berries I just use whatever I find at
Sephora that catches my eye whether it's
like brightening the hydrating mask
whatever I'd rather just use masks that
you apply onto your face and then wash
off so as you guys ready now my favorite
brands and face masks is fresh and
mystical thing that I'm talking about I
feel so passionate for my all-time
favorite is the fresh black tea instant
thing mask I remember being blown away
the first time I use this it's very
velvety and soft on your skin and when
you wipe it off it's like a restart
button like you use a and your skin is
just it looks ten times better
it's great and then also just to quickly
mention there rose face mask and their
vitamin nectar one are also great I like
to use these when I'm like taking a bath
well ma the next product is a newer
favorite and very similar to the truth
serum that I'm talking about but it's
the old Henrickson pure truth youth
activating oil so this is a very
concentrated dark orange oil I don't use
this every day because your face will be
very oily and kind of orange and you're
like well we're going on so I'll
actually mix this into my dramatically
different gels from Clinique to kind of
dilute the product and not have it be as
intense I'll use this at nighttime it
basically nourishes repairs and brains
your skin the last product that I love
to use and wanted to mention is actually
the only products that specifically
focuses on acne one of times when I have
a simple come up really like B Mario
Badescu skincare drying lotion it looks
a little funky because you've got this
mysterious pink substance at the bottom
and then clear liquid at the top and so
basically what you do is you'll get a
q-tip into the pink products and just
pull it right out and then you just dot
on your face wherever you have any
little spots or pimples so I'll use this
at nighttime if anything is going on so
those are all three products that I like
to use every single day and that I have
just found so much love for of course I
will have all the links down below I
really hope that you guys try out some
of these products as I feel they are
great for so many different skin types
and wow Island only want the video to be
over I wish I had more products to talk
about or something I love you guys so
much and I will see you guys for a new
video next week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
