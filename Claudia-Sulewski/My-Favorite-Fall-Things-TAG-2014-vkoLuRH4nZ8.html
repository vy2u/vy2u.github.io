tag video and it is the my favourites
fall tag no my favorite fall things tag
how it goes
basically this tag video consists of
categories for makeup hair fashion
things like that and I'm just going to
be talking about different products that
I like to use during the fall time so
let's get started yeah first question is
what is your favorite fall a beauty face
product and I don't really like to wear
a lot of makeup throughout the week
usually just like on the weekends so I
decided to go with my trusty face lotion
I'm more oily during the summer time but
my face definitely gets drier towards
the fall and winter so my favorite face
products would have to be at the first
date Beauty ultra Repair lotion if I'm
breaking out I'll use my Clean &amp;amp; Clear
lotion but this is the one that I like
to use to hydrate my face yeah so that
would be my first one the second
question is what is your favorite fall
chic product and I don't have to be this
NYX blush and this is in the shade of
bittersweet and the reason why I chose
this one was because it's kind of like a
darker plum color and I really like
taking Palama blushes and applying them
a little bit lower than I would normally
apply my blush so it kind of works as
like a contour slash cheek color so I'll
just apply this right below my
cheekbones and I really like the effect
that it gives number three asks what is
your favorite fall I makeup product and
mine would I kind of had troubles
deciding this one because I usually wear
these same eye makeup every single day
but I would have to say the Urban Decay
Naked 3 palette just because the colors
in here for some reason remind me a lot
of fall time I tend to wear a lot of
like purples and
and stuff like that during the fall time
especially like with my lips and stuff
so I have been grabbing towards this a
little more recently I'm trying to kind
of venture out jersey my favorite fall
lip color was probably one of the harder
things that I have to choose because I
love wearing lipstick during the fall
time I wear colors that are almost black
- bright - orange / red / purple like I
wear every single lip color I narrowed
it down to one product it is the MAC
lipstick in the shade diva Mac is
definitely my number one like go-to
brand for lipstick so this is a shade
diva it's kind of like a darker vampy
red I really I don't know it's just like
a dark red the next category is hair
product and if you guys have been
watching me for a while you would know
that I do not put a lot of product in my
hair I feel like I never have new hair
products to talk about because I
literally just like you use the same
stuff so I kind of just pull this out of
my bathroom because I literally had
nothing else to pull out so it would
have to be this dry shampoo it is the
batiste dry shampoo for dark and deep
brown hair I have been using this for
like over a year now I would say and
it's definitely my favorite dry shampoo
it's really great if you don't want to
wash your hair for a few days I also
just really like how its tinted so it
doesn't have like that weird like white
look on your roots if you have darker
hair on the top like I do I'm gonna go
with this one even though this really
has no relation to fall whatsoever but
we're just gonna go with it
so yeah member 6 asks what is my
favorite fall fragrance / candle and I
don't really have any perfumes that go
with fall
kinda just wear whatever I want to wear
I'm honestly the worst person for this
tag video so I'm gonna go with candle
and it would definitely have to be the
Bath and Body Works autumn sky candle I
have a lot of like different fall
candles in my house right now so I'm
saving this one to burn last or just
y-you know it's not been burned yet but
it smells so good it's very like musky
and manly smelling but it also kind of
smells like fall as well and it does
have leaves on stickers so go me for
choosing something that actually is
related to fall member Stefan asked what
is my favorite to fall nail polish this
is actually a newer item that I
purchased this is the SCN nail polish in
the shade master plan and I really like
buying and wearing nail polishes that
people like normally wouldn't choose to
get so this color is kind of hard to
explain it's like a cement gray but it
has kind of a warmer tint to it almost
like a brown I wish I had like a
description on the bottom like they do
for candles but I thought this color was
really pretty and I really like wearing
kind of like brown and gray nail
polishes during fall time now we're
gonna get into the fall fashion
favorites which is what I was excited
about because I definitely like clothing
and fashion more than makeup but yeah so
the first category is trendy clothing
item I've actually got two favorites and
a couple pieces that I wanted to show
you guys the first one would have to be
extremely ripped jeans so I got these
from I believe it's called white fox
calm it's an Australian website I will
link them down below but I recently got
this pair of jeans from them and I love
how it's super ripped up so it's really
great for this time of year because
they're a little bit
since they're longer pants what you
still have that breezy action going on
with the huge rips on the thighs so this
would have to be my first kind of trendy
item I've definitely seen lots of people
wearing jeans like this and I think it's
super cute
my second one would have to be statement
jackets I feel like I constantly like
follow this trend every single year
during this time because I just love
kind of throwing on a really cool funky
jackets like complete the look so I've
actually got three to show you guys and
I think I also have pictures of me
wearing them so off they're the same the
first one looks like this it literally
looks and feels like a robe which
honestly could not get any better so
it's this kind of light blue color it's
got pockets and this jacket is from mink
pink I absolutely love it can wear with
some leggings or some jeans or some
shorts honestly anything so I really
really love this one the second coat
that I wanted to show you guys it looks
like a flannel which I mean duh it's a
flannel but it has like a thicker
material so definitely fall under the
jacket category but it's got some kind
of brown accents on the top and then on
the back BAM
it's got a tiger on it in a triangle so
trendy I know how do I do it
I don't know I'm just kidding but I got
this jacket at the Melrose trading post
here in LA and this is actually by the
brand I'm probably gonna butcher this
but it's vintage red ox red ox vintage
red ox I don't really know I will link
the company that makes these jackets
they're super sweet and I just think it
looks awesome they have different
animals and they put them on different
flannels and it's totally super awesome
so I really really like this jacket and
then the last one that is also like a
statement jacket would have to be this
one for a mink pink it's more of like a
bomber
jacket so it's got the crazy sleeves and
then the rest of it is just black and
yeah I really like this jacket so those
would have to be my two favorite like
trendy clothing items the next one is
comfy clothing item and I'm actually
wearing it right now it is comfy
sweaters this sweater is from wasteland
and I really like the sleeves on it it
looks like it's like inside-out and it
has like this little thing right here so
I probably just have to say sweaters I
love wearing sweaters during the fall
time because you're all warm and cozy a
third question for the fashion category
is what are your favorite fall shoes and
I've got two pairs of boots with me
because I love them equally the first
pair you guys have already seen there
from wasteland and they're just these
black combat boots but they have like a
chunky heel to them so I've been wearing
these almost every single day since I
got them I just really am obsessed with
these a lot I really really like these
and they go with everything so I will
definitely see myself wearing these all
throughout fall and winter and the rest
of my life basically and then the second
pair of boots I actually got these
pretty recently out say maybe like a
week ago a few days ago I don't know
these are also from wasteland and from
the viewfinder it kind of looks like
these are black but they definitely are
not
they're like a oh wait can you kind of
see that they're like a purpley dark
blue indigo color and it's really fuzzy
it has like that velvet finish I don't
know if I'm describing that right but
they're super fuzzy and those who have
to be in my favorite shoes the last fall
fashion favorites is your favorite
accessory and I definitely wear this all
year so once again I'm showing you guys
something that doesn't specifically
apply to fall time but that's okay
because I wear this all the time and it
cut its kind of polished in a way not
really just what is it Claudia it is
this little black leather bracelet my
mom actually found this
I think in some flea markets somewhere
in Chicago or something like that and
right before we got to California she
asked me if I wanted anything of hers to
kind of remind me of her and right away
I knew to ask for this bracelet because
I loved it so much
I wear it almost every single day
because I just wear a lot of black and
like silver jewelry so it's really cool
it's basically just like a little mini
black belt for your wrist and I just I
love it it's very unique and different
and yeah I reminds me of my mama every
time I look at it except we've got some
fun fall favorites oh we're getting fun
up in here the first question asks
Halloween or Thanksgiving and I would
probably have to say Halloween I love
Thanksgiving food so much like oh my god
pumpkin pie with vanilla bean ice cream
on top is so good but overall I just
love Halloween more I really like going
to haunted houses and mazes and carving
pumpkins which I did not do this year
I'm very upset about that but yeah I'm
dressing up and things like that I find
super fun so I'd have to say Halloween
the second question asks favorites
festive food and/or drink
wow I didn't even think about this one
well I probably have to say number one
pumpkin pie with vanilla bean ice cream
but the pie has to be warm so the ice
cream kind of like melts and soaks in oh
so good I've actually never tried a
pumpkin spice latte that might surprise
some of you guys but I've never tried
that that couldn't be one of my
favorites I will never know mashed
potatoes is that fall ish I don't know I
like mashed potatoes though number 3
asks what's the happiest part about fall
for you if I was back at home I would
probably say looking at the fall
right
if I was like at home I would probably
say the fall leaves the block that lived
on had so many different like trees that
changed into different colors so I
remember we had this one tree that had
like yellow leaves and there's another
head of red and it was just really
pretty looking down the street and
saying all the different colors can
attack anyone specifically but if you
guys want to do it or if you guys have a
youtube channel here a beauty guru you
don't have to be a beauty girl you're
just a blogger and you want to do it
then I tell you to do it do it also I
want to thank Lindsey and Maddy for
tagging me I will link their videos in
the downbar but they taught me to do
this so that is why I'm doing it yeah I
had so much fun filming this video for
you guys I love just being able to sit
down block away talk about products that
have no relation to fall most of them
even though it's called but that was it
for today's video I hope you guys
enjoyed it and I will talk to you guys
very soon bye walking throughout the
villages ago kaleidescope of loud
heartbeats under coats</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
