special day for me because exactly one
year ago I created my first youtube
video on this channel and it's
unbelievable how fast this year went by
but I just remember my first video being
just this blue ocean inspired tutorial
or something like that it's I mean you
guys can't watch it anymore because it's
like long gone removed from my channel
or deleted but I just can't believe that
I have been doing this for entire year
because it honestly feels like I've only
been doing this for a couple of months
like that's how much I enjoy it because
when like things that you love doing
stuff like that tend to go really
quickly for me and this honestly this
entire year of being on YouTube and just
talking to all of you guys making videos
has honestly flew by right past me and
it still feels like I'm on like North
number four so I just wanted to make
this video telling you guys how much I
am like honored to have this YouTube
channel and having all of you guys as my
friends and just how appreciative I am
for all of you guys subscribing to me
and it's just so crazy because like it's
not that like YouTube changed my life
because I'm obviously really young so I
mean I can't say that but it's honestly
changed me to like a whole nother person
like I wouldn't have met any of you guys
and I made a lot I met a lot of friends
here on YouTube and it's just I mean
it's like a whole nother life for me
like YouTube has become such a big part
of my life like it basically took over
fifty percent of my life because I go on
youtube every single day check Mike
check all my comments all my inboxes and
go on Twitter and all that junk and
it's just really fun for me I love doing
this and to think that it's been a year
I mean that felt like nothing so don't
worry about me going anywhere because
I'm definitely gonna keep on doing video
videos for you guys i extremely loved it
so don't worry I'm not going anywhere
I'm not gonna like also to disappear and
stop making videos because I'm too
obsessed with making videos for you guys
it's just I don't know I feel like it's
an entire big like second family for me
I would never have thought that I'd
reached ten over ten thousand five
hundred subscribers and that is I mean
it doesn t matter about numbers but just
the thought that like all you girls and
guys are watching me is really crazy and
I love you guys all so much I just want
to tell you guys thank you so much for
subscribing it really makes my day when
even just like one person subscribes or
one of you guys comment or send me a
message or anything like that it's like
the greatest feeling in the entire world
to know that I helped you guys and see
you guys look up to me even as a role
model which is really crazy and oh my
god I can't believe like it's been an
entire year it's so crazy so I just want
to tell you guys thank you so so so so
so so so so much for supporting me
through this entire year I still
remember the first day I got my first
subscriber how excited I was and also I
remember the day that I reached 10,000
subscribers so I just quickly want to
say that and I know that usually people
have contests for their one year
anniversary but like I think I've
mentioned before I don't really have any
money for myself to buy you guys any
like prizes or anything like that and
shipping them out still kind of a
problem because when you share things
out and if you don't want to stay where
you're from because obviously I don't
want to get
I informational way if I don't write
like the where it came from and if that
package got lost in the mail you can't
really retrace it back or anything or
something like that some thinking maybe
to create like a p.o box or something so
I still kinda just have to figure out
like the whole contest stuff i really
wish i could give you guys contests and
stuff like that seriously um but so in
for substituting for that or wait in
replacement of that I just made a quick
vlog yesterday which was Tuesday with my
friends we had no school so I just vlogs
babe mainly like the entire day so I
want to quickly show you guys that and
since again says I just want to tell you
guys that thank you so much i love you
all and it's crazy I oh my god I just
okay yeah I'm gonna go now so um keep
watching and thanks so much bye hey
everyone so today I'm going to go to
this like breakfast restaurant with my
friends so I'm going to feel a little
bit in there or whatever but i'm going
to show you guys my off of the day first
and it's really casual and simple except
there's just like one thing that's kind
of like which is like my shoes um so i'm
going to quickly just show you guys im
doing in the mirror that's why it's like
really weird right now but this is my
outfit that's how it looks so i just got
white tank top dark or medium colored
skinny jeans and then I have a plane
light grey shirt on and it's the legit
there's like nothing on this shirt and
then I'm wearing this darker grey zip-up
sweatshirt which is from victoria secret
and then for shoes I've got these crazy
boots with the fur and they're like a
tan color and is my mom and you can get
these at Nina Marcus and she got them
about two years ago so I don't know if
you could still find them but I think
they were around like six hundred
dollars or something so definitely know
why she wouldn't let me wear those when
I was younger but for the
I just have it in a high side ponytail
and my hair still kind of curly from
halloween and then for makeup i just
