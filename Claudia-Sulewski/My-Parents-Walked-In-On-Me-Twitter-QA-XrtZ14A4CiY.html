welcome back to my channel today's video
is going to be a good old Q&amp;amp;A I missed
you guys to tweet me questions with the
hashtag clot um ask Claudia a little
scatterbrained today but you guys sent
in so many great questions so I chose a
few of them and I'm going to be
answering them let's do this
the first question asks who is monkey
MANET yes this is the time of giving you
to promote tag for starters great
question but also even greater segue
into letting me introduce tagged
it's another webseries that recently
came out that I acted in the show is
really awesome it's like a thriller
horror AMA about these three girls to
get blackmailed by a murderer who wears
a monkey mask and his name's monkey man
each episode is crazy suspenseful and
I'm so so excited for you guys to see it
so if you want to first three episodes
are out and of course I will leave the
link in the downbar it's on go 90 but to
answer your question I am NOT answering
your question you have to watch a show
to figure out who monkey man is how
awkward is it to film kissing scenes
with people you're friends with
surprisingly it's not as awkward as you
would imagine it to be the first time is
definitely like okay this is happening
once you get over that it kind of just
becomes a very casual thing like you
feel like you're just high-fiving the
person or giving them like a handshake
but it's fun I guess how do you think
you've changed throughout your YouTube
career I am more aware of Who I am and
what I value and want in life what's the
most rebellious thing you've ever done
um I'm sure there's a lot ah definitely
a lot the first thing that comes to my
head
was and you guys cannot judge me for
past Claudia I believe sophomore year I
cheated on my math final and I got
caught and this wasn't just like a
chapter test
or a quiz at the end of the week like
this was the end of the year final when
you are tested on everything that you
know obviously that was the worst idea
in the entire world and I actually
didn't even end up needing the cheat
sheet that I made I basically just made
like a little cheat sheet I think it was
for formulas or something like that a
few my friends and I did that yeah I
didn't really end up using it but she
found it on me because I'm an idiot
switch also good because it you know
taught me to never do that again my
teacher totally could have given me an F
and that would have lowered my grade
probably an entire letter luckily she
let me come in the next day alone and
retake the entire test obviously without
cheating and I ended up getting a better
score than I did on the previous one so
in the long run it was all okay don't
cheat though guys don't do it please
share about your black lives matter
protest experience a few weeks ago I
walked in a black lives matter protest
out here in LA it was so insane I don't
even know what words to use to describe
it but I think it just helped to put
everything into perspective
it helped me realize how real and how
this is really happening out in this
world thousands of people showed up and
we had this big meeting in this huge
park and then we decided to start the
protest so we were walking on busy
streets and I think later on they even
got onto the freeway which is crazy but
by then I already went home because it
started getting late it was really cool
to see so many people come together for
one purpose and one reason I'm really
happy that I did it do you believe in
love at first sight no I do not I don't
think that you can fall in love with
someone based on just their appearance I
think you also have to discover what
they're like as a person the personality
their opinions on things all that stuff
I think a lot more just plays into it
what's the most attractive quality in a
guy for you obviously there's the
classics like a sense of humor and oral
hygiene you know things like that but
I've noticed that I'm very attracted to
people that have a very driven
personality and are motivated in
whatever they're doing what's your most
used phrase I say 100% in replace of
totally or definitely all the time
it's annoying what was it like working
with at Lucas gage be honest okay
at Lucas gage I can totally sit here and
make fun of you and say something down
but I'm gonna be honest working with you
is so awesome and just being friends
with you in general you're an awesome
human being and you definitely helped me
to relax
and honestly discover my love for acting
you're a great guy so much fun to be
around would you give up YouTube to do
professional movies and shows that is
definitely something that I want to aim
for and continue to do but I don't think
that I'll ever quit YouTube because of
it that being said I do think that
eventually I will kind of grow out of
YouTube just because I don't want that
to be my forever I see myself putting
more energy and focus into other things
and we're talking way in the future but
I do think that I will end up blogging
more than I will keeping up with this
channel on a weekly basis because
vlogging is kind of more personal and I
think it'd be really cool to show you
guys behind the scenes on stuff and keep
you updated with my life and I kind of
value those videos more than like me
showing my favorite products of the
month if that makes sense what is the
worst thing that your parents walked in
on you doing throughout high school I
wasn't really like a crazy gal I mean to
an extent like I never really brought
boys home so I never had my parents walk
in on me with a guy but one evening that
is standing out to me right now it was
about 3 or 4 a.m. and a few of my
friends and I we were trying to get into
my house after one of the homecoming
dances right when my parents got home my
dad walked in on us kicking down and
breaking our back door which resulted in
a lot of screaming and yelling and lots
of tension in the room while my friends
were just like but then somehow that
night ended up turning into a co-ed
sleepover with my friend Neely and Jacob
we somehow managed to squeeze the three
of us onto my tiny little twin bed at
the
I'm I remember being like shoved against
the wall and we we fell asleep it was
weird
weird night let me know if you guys want
like a full detailed story of that what
do you think about homophobic people
honestly why are there so homophobic
people in this world I think that
everyone is allowed to love whoever they
want it's 2016 get over it
how can you tell the difference between
fake and real friends I think in general
when you're trying to find genuine real
friends ask yourself which people make
you happy and make you want to be a
better person because I think it's
really important to surround yourself
with people that want you to do the best
and follow your goals and motivate you
to being a kinder person what is one
thing you've learned in 2016 so far the
pain of procrastination is far worse
than the pain of actually doing it so
those are all the questions that we'll
be answering in today's video and that
isn't it for today's video I what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
