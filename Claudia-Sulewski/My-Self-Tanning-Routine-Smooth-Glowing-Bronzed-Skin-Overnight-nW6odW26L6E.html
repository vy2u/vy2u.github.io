channel I can't even stress how highly
recommended this video is you guys are
always asking me about how I get my skin
to look tan and bronzed and glowy and
smooth pretty much all throughout the
year it can be the middle of winter and
I still achieve this so before putting
on any lotions or self tanners or
anything on your skin you got to make
sure that it's prepped this is key this
is what gets your skin at looking smooth
and glowy it also helps to maintain the
tan by that I mean exfoliating and
getting rid of any hair on your body
step number one is to exfoliate your
entire body stomach arms legs back
everything using a loofah works I like
to use just little sugar body scrub this
one is the brown sugar body polish by
fresh you want to get all those dead
skin cells off so that you're starting
with a fresh skin base if that makes
sense it's also gonna help with the hair
removal process too because you're
getting like the old skin either way
let's talk about hair removal there are
a lot of different ways that you can get
rid of like your like hair wherever
waxing shaving laser hair removal
epilator 's like that there's everything
there's a lot as I'm very passionate
about this subject I'm so so excited to
announce my partnership with Braun
iconic I've been using them for years I
am so honored to be working with them
anyways so every few months I'm going to
be uploading a video talking about one
of my favorite products from Braun this
video being the first installment out of
all four so just to brush you guys up
real quick Braun basically offers the
perfect range of beauty and hair removal
devices that will suit whatever needs
you need whatever that doesn't make
sense when putting on self-tanner I
don't like to shave my legs prior
because that is only barely just shaving
off your leg hair and then honestly the
next day you wake up with prickles again
so I like to do something that's a
little bit more long-lasting you'll have
smoother legs for longer and then you
don't have to worry about messing with
anything that is when this bad boy comes
into play I'm holding the braun
silk-Ã©pil 3 to 70 leg and body epilator
and shaver you guys don't know what it
up later is fear not it's basically an
at-home
hair removal device where you basically
just roll the device on your body
obviously while it's turned on so this
one plugs in you've got two different
speeds at the head you've got little
tweezers this one specifically is a
twenty twice or system and so as its
rotating and these tweezers are clamping
down and tweezing out your hair thus
making it more long-lasting because it's
actually removing your hair from the
roots and it's not just shaving across
like a regular razor would this one
specifically is the most lightweight
device that Braun carries okay great for
traveling you can just roll it up throw
it into your travel case also depending
on what you're using it for it comes
with a little shaver head and trimmer
cap that you can throw on top also when
you turn it on you'll notice it has like
a little smart light system that lights
up and shows you where you have to go
over and then it's also got these little
massaging rollers that kind of helps to
massage your skin as you are running
over it this little guy sells for $45 on
Amazon I'll obviously have it linked
down below I'll basically just use this
and run it all across my legs my thighs
and then I just leave the hair on my
arms because they're blonde and I'm not
worried about it let's talk about the
self-tanner now I play around with
different brands different types of
self-tanner I go to for me is bronzing
mousse this one is from Saint okay it's
the darkest one because I don't mess
around I'm not here for a medium bronze
I want the dark bronze always always
always use a bronzing mix whether it's
thicker like this or even just a little
foam it's you don't want to get on your
hands it absorbs very very quickly on
your palms the bottoms of your feet can
also use different lotions I have this
one from Tarte and the FINA Liberata
these are really great also from San
Tropez I love using their bronzing mist
specifically on my face because it just
gets all of the crevices and angles and
everything I'll even use it on my back
because that's like a little harder to
reach with a mint keep in mind you don't
want to put any lotion on before putting
on self-tanner you want to just have
clean smooth prepped ready skin nothing
on it so that this stuff can sink in and
do its job like you don't want to have a
lotion interfering however many layers
you want I usually do one sometimes two
if I'm feeling crazy I
to do this towards the end of the day
and not necessarily right before bed
because you want the stuff to sort up
sink in and dry up before you get all
warm and cozy and sweaty under the
blanket you want this stuff to dry I'll
do it a few hours before bed and I'll be
sure to wear a very loose clothing when
it comes down to sleeping I like to wear
a long sleeve shirt and long sweat pants
that way what my legs are laying on each
other at nighttime I'm not gonna get all
sticky and moist and then mix around so
I have to fully cover my body it also
helps to not get self-tanner all over
your bedsheets and stuff go to bed sleep
in it overnight that's gonna help it to
fully develop in the morning time you're
probably going to look very very very
tan so what you're supposed to do is
just jump in the shower and quickly
rinse off your body don't use soap don't
exfoliate nothing just very gently wrap
around and massage and get the product
off so you're basically just left with
the layer that is underneath your skin
it's blended out and that also is going
to develop over the day so you will
slowly kind of see your tan sinking I
did want to mention a few tricks and
different products I like to use to
maintain the tan or look a little more
glowy stuff like that there are a lot of
different temporary bronzers and self
tanners that you can just wear for the
day or for the night if you have like a
special occasion the hoola zero tanlines
is really nice it comes with this little
foam cap thing that you just massage in
and it smells so good so when my tan
starts to fade or if my face needs a
little more color whatever it may be
this stuff is really great body blur by
Vita Liberata is so good this stuff
looks so good on your legs it doesn't
get all over your clothes obviously you
just got to be careful you first put
this stuff on always always use them it
never use your hands also really love
the Tarte of better bond they all kind
of do the same thing but they just help
to maintain the color obviously once
everything is set and you're just
enjoying your tan you can apply them
lotion to keep your skin moisturized
that'll help to keep the skin from
flaking off weirdly all that stuff so
stay moisturize also to look more glowy
for different occasions I don't do this
everyday because it's really really
extra but you can totally put
highlighter
different points of your body I mean
everyone obviously does the face stuff
but you could totally put highlighter on
your collarbones even on your shoulders
right here and it helps just to catch
the lay and it looks so good also if
you're showing off your legs you can
just run a giant brush down your shins
and a little bit up on your thigh as
well that kind of gives you like the
super shiny long leg look that all
celebrities have on like red carpet
pictures and stuff that is what they do
yeah honestly I feel like it's nothing
too crazy that is what I do to stay
bronzed and glowy and smooth throughout
the entire year basically whatever I
want to super easy
overnight process I want to know what
products you guys like to use of course
I'll have all the links down in down bar
thank you so much bran I'm so excited to
continue this bran series and show you
guys the different ways that I like to
use their products so and of course that
stuff will all be down there as well I
love you guys so much and I hope you
have a great rest of your week see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
