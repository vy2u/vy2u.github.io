I'm about to hit record my mini-fridge
turns on now it's my time to shine hey
guys and welcome back to Spring Break
with Claudia for today's video I'm going
to be showing you guys in my swimsuit
collection and what swimsuits I like to
wear and before I start showing you guys
my swimsuits I just wanted to say that I
love to mix and match different tops and
bottoms even from different stores so
I'm gonna start out by showing you guys
my favorite combos that I like to wear
and then at the end of the video I'm
going to show you guys some random tops
and bottoms that I also own and really
like and kind of wear with whatever else
I want to wear it with so I'm gonna
start off by showing you guys the combos
that I like the best also these are in
no particular order except for the first
one because it is definitely my favorite
so starting off with the top it looks
like this and it's from Victoria's
Secret it's one of those strapless
cuffed ones that has some ruching in the
middle and this one is really cute
because on the back it has like these
braided strings and a gold little clasp
thing so it just gives a nice little
extra touch and I just really love this
color if you guys didn't know
purple is actually my favorite color and
with this top I love love love wearing
these bottoms which I got from PacSun
and these are by the brands O'Neil as
you can see they're brights and Chevron
and they just go perfectly with this top
for the next combo I'm going to show you
guys the tops and bottoms were actually
meant for each other so I got both of
them from PacSun I really like Paxton
and Victoria's Secret for bathing suits
you guys will see a trend happening but
the top looks like this so it's really
cute it's strapless just like the first
one and the cups are grey with orange
and teal flowers on it and then the back
has two straps which looks really cool
when you have the bathing suit on
and these came with these bottoms
rapture so as you can see it has the
same pattern on the front and back
except it's black on the sides and this
one is really really cute my next
bathing suit combo is all black so
starting off with the top it is the same
exact thing is the purple one except
it's simple on the back it doesn't have
those braided strands and with this top
I like to wear these bottoms which I'm
not sure what website I've got these off
of but you can honestly find these
anywhere it's by the brand mandoline
they are just all they are all black but
they have three straps on the sides so
it looks really really cool when you
wear it and they are a little bit cheeky
err on the back so these are kind of
cool too tannin plus they give you like
the coolest talons ever so these
actually look really cute together
my next bathing suit is one of the newer
ones that I got and these are both by
the brand
Frankie's bikinis and I'll be sure to
link the bottoms and tops for this
because I am so obsessed with this
bathing suit first of all it's like
banana yellow and the like crochet
details on this is just so frickin
pretty so starting off at the top it
looks like this it's got like a V kind
of wire in the middle so it has a really
cool shape and then you get a halter
strap and then the back which is the
prettiest part looks like this so as you
can see it's got a lot of knots and
straps and strings going on which looks
so cool with that top I like to wear
this bottom because just look at this as
you can see the straps start from the
front and then on the sides they like go
into knots and it's so cute I will warn
you guys that these bottoms are very
very cheeky so they're great to tanin
but yeah they look like this and I'm
obsessed with this bathing suit my next
bathing suit I actually showed you guys
in my last video but I have two bottoms
that I like to wear up the top so
oh the top looks like this it's from
pink and it's just all black but it
crosses in the front and has really cute
cutouts so I really really like this top
and with that I either like to wear
these bottoms which I also showed you
guys they're just teal and black and
they Roush on the front and back no my
camera and then also I got these same
exact bottoms but a different pattern
and this one is so cute it's just black
and white and obviously it's striped but
it is so pretty now that I actually
think about it I take back the first
bathing suit being my favorite because I
really really like this combo it just
looks so cute on so I've got those and
now we're gonna get into the more
miscellaneous tops and bottoms that I
like to switch up every time I wear so
that's good started the first top is
from Victoria's Secret I got this one a
while back but it's just hot pink and
that it has baby pink straps and a
little bow in the front and it also has
like a teardrop cutout at the top the
next bathing suit top is from PacSun and
it's similar to the one that I showed
you guys earlier except it has like this
almost like Hispanic looking striped
pattern I don't know why I feel like
this would be on like one of those
blankets or something right does anyone
else see that but it's got black boobies
on it and it has the double straps like
the other one has the next top that I
have is from Hollister and it looks like
this I really like the pattern on it
it's navy blue with pink and lime green
flowers on it so it's really cute
for these summertime I don't know what
else you would wear bathing suits but
you know we're going with it the next
top that I want to show you guys is from
Victoria's Secret and it looks like this
I really like wearing this for any like
sporty-er water activities that I'm
doing whether it's like tubing or water
skiing or stuff like that because this
one gives you like a lot of support and
you
that it will not fly off like this thing
stays on I mean you know I hope that all
my bathing suits would stay on but you
know what I mean like this one this one
ain't coming off so it's really cute
because it has a stripe to rainbow
pattern on it and this looks really cute
against a really dark tan because of the
bright colors it just pops out at you
and next up I have three different
bottoms so the first pair I got from
forever 21 and these are just all black
they've got some gold hoops on the sides
but the texture of these bottoms is what
sold me because it really cool like I
don't know what you would call this it's
got holes I'll have a close-up on these
bottoms but the texture is really cool
and it just gives a nice little twist to
these simple black bottoms so I have
this one the next bathing suit bottom I
got is also from forever 21 and it's the
same shape so both of them have a little
bit of ruching at the top of the butt
but yeah this one obviously is bright
hot pink and white and it's tie-dyed so
I thought this one was really fun and
cool and the last two bathing suit
bottom that I have is from Victoria's
Secret and it's just striped it's baby
pink and white and it's got a really
cute like roughly design on the front
which just gives it a really nice touch
and then the back is just simple so
something is that is it for my swimsuit
haul are you guys also into very bright
and colorful bathing suits like I am or
do you like to just keep it simple with
black and white bathing suits let me
know in the comments down below and I
will see you guys for a new video very
soon bye guys
