today's video because this is the first
time that I'm ever going to be talking
about this subject with you guys
actually talked a little bit about it in
my one of my newest halls on my second
channel which is beyond beauty star TV
it's always in the downbar so you can
always check it out my bra strap showing
right now so that's kind of bothering me
okay um well yeah so Miss this is going
to be the first time I've ever talking
about you know like this subject on this
channel and I'm super excited because I
love this so basically today I'm going
to be talking about thrift shopping or
thrifting or I guess thats I say um and
basically for those of the people like
for those of you guys who don't really
know that is their stores are basically
stores where people come in and they
sell their stuff or they donate their
stuff and then the store kind of like
resells them so it's like a resale kind
of shop um what's it called and it's
basically clothes that you know people
maybe it doesn't fit them anymore or
maybe they never even wore them because
a lot of things I've bought in for this
thrift stores still have the original
tag on them so they're basically new and
no one ever or them so it's usually
closed that maybe has been slightly worn
but they're still in good shape and
stuff so people will like come and just
drop them off at store in the story you
know sells them for other people and I
absolutely love this idea it's really
great because the clothes is really
really inexpensive like I'm talking
about some places only sell like they'll
sell like two dollars for a shirt like
one dollar for a pair of jean shorts
like I'm talking that inexpensive it's
really really great this is really gonna
bother me
maybe I can go anyways so um what to
call it today I'm going to tell you guys
I'm kind of my story a little bit and
also my tips and tricks on you know
finding the best things at their stores
and just how to shop and stuff like that
so basically my story is I have been
thrift shopping ever since I was like
five years old like I've honestly been
doing my whole life like obviously I
don't buy all of my clothes from their
Shores because you know I used to be
obsessed with like I have a combi what
else at all and stuff like that but I'm
not saying that i always like clothes
there but you know every now and then as
up as i was little i would always be my
mom would always go there and just like
choose clothes and stuff so you would
think that if I've been doing this
basically all my life that you know I
have some tricks up lot of my ah I can't
talk to say that I would have some
tricks up my sleeve on how to shop there
and stuff like that and I what's it
called if you guys are wondering why
never did halls from this thrift stores
before sorry I can't talk today um
that's because before like bigger beauty
girls kind of like started making their
store halls and stuff like that I was
kind of embarrassed to make it their
story all just because I never knew that
anyone else did this but then once I
noticed that a bunch of other ghosts
into I was like oh ok well now i'm going
to tell you guys my story and start
doing them i'm so excited after in a
couple videos or I don't know maybe it's
my next video I will very soon be doing
after store haul but I'm going to be
doing a collective one just so far of
this year well maybe I'm missing out on
a couple close but I started making a
list on a bunch of things that i bought
this year from their stores so it's
going to be like a collective haul and
she's going to be one big hall and i
started making the list couple days ago
and i already have like 20 things i'm
gonna mention in the video i know this
is excited I just love three shopping
it's so fun and also I wrote up a couple
of little tips and tricks that I have
for you guys that I came up
then asked my mom she had any like tips
either and I read over with them stuff
like that and these aren't in any order
I have a bunch of stuff that are to tell
you guys I'm really excited to share
this with you because I think it will
help a lot of you girls out there who
maybe I've never done it before or have
done it but you know are still beginners
at it and stuff so I'm just going to get
right into it and if you're wondering
about this dress i actually bought this
from another store i just want to show
you guys one of the items that you can
buy because you can really buy beautiful
things so this is like a dress and it
has really pretty like gold detailing in
it it's like loser on the bottom so i
would have to like pin up like a I mean
that pin up I like put a gold belt with
it and then I just matched it with my
gold like little Bengal thinga majig
from forever 21 there you go and I'm
trying to at the middle part today my
hair is really like flat and not like
whatever I don't care okay I'm not going
to touch my hair in today's video
because I know how much you guys hate
that um okay I'm not firmly on I'm just
going to get onto the tips and if you're
wondering i'm reading from a piece of
paper that's why i'm going to be looking
down um okay so the first one is if you
know you're gonna well first of all make
sure you always plan that you know when
you're going don't really do it at last
minute at like eight o'clock at night
because you want to go really early like
I'm not saying really really early but
um you want to go earlier just because
if it's your first time going to like a
different store you know you want to go
early because you don't know what you're
going to expect maybe you're going to
want to go through everything because i
know that when me and my mom go through
for shopping we spend at least like two
hours in there just going through
everything like because if you want to
find the best clothes you have to go
through everything try on everything and
that's how you will find the good stuff
so make sure that you go pretty early
and just make sure that you're going on
a day where you're free and like you
won't you know that you don't have other
plans that you have to quickly go to
like you really want to spend your time
in there and just look through
everything so the next one is don't only
focus on your size for example if you're
like a small or something don't only
look at this small things because
sometimes
shirts and dresses and stuff like that
or sweatpants they look cuter when
they're in a larger size so make sure
that you look through every single size
you don't want to focus on only yours
because you know like crop tops and
stuff like that or like box shirts maybe
they'll look better in a bigger size so
you never really know um and here's a
tip for the girls I don't really
recommend this for the guys just well
yeah I don't know how to recommend this
for the guys but for girls definitely
look through clothes that's supposed to
be for the opposite sex which is you
know guy clothes because um wait I wrote
this down right here because if you okay
um you always want to look some guys
stuff because you know sometimes they'll
have like large like oversized sweaters
that look really cute with like jeggings
and uggs or something also they really
have they have nice v necks like you can
buy really loose like a boyfriend style
white v-neck shirts I don't know if you
guys do this but for me you can buy guys
shirts and cut them down the side like a
sleeveless shirt and then we r sports
bra underneath and that's like what I
workout in or something like that but
you know obviously your not going like
wear that to school but like you know
that's like an option for working out
and stuff what else I don't know but
yeah definitely just look through their
stuff because they'll have you know like
cute like sweaters and sometimes you
know whatever um so definitely that so
always look for you know guys do guy
stuff and different sizes um this is
like my little like trick that i do and
i definitely recommend you guys to do
this we're only a tank top / undershirt
when you go because sometimes they don't
have dressing rooms and stuff and
sometimes like stores will be like oh
you can only bring in six items in the
dressing room and it's like okay well i
have like 10 shirts wear a tank top and
just like jean shorts when you go
shopping because then they'd most likely
have like 10 meters around the entire
shop so i can do sue it's just try on
shirts like on the go just put it on
your tank top that's what I do because
it definitely saves time and it's a lot
easier and stuff like that so you can
always just like throw on stuff in front
of the mirror
want to try it on so definitely just
wear like a tank top like ass like a
what's it called like a spaghetti strap
shirt also remember to use your
imagination because you might see
something that looks kind of unappealing
you might be like okay well I normally
wouldn't like this but just imagine how
you can work within pull it off like
sometimes like i'll see like like for
example this dress is like really just
like big on the bottom it doesn't really
have any shape to it and i was thinking
oh ok well the top is cute you know it's
from hmm maybe if I match a belt to it
to give it a little more shape then
maybe I'll like it so just kind of like
use your imagination and just kind of
think ahead and stuff like that so
definitely that um let's see okay so i
don't know sometimes i can be moody so
sometimes it can be a pain to look like
four hours just look through clothes you
know your hands get tired so make sure
you come on a happy day with a clear
head you know you don't really have
anything bothering you so you can focus
on your shopping and stuff like that um
also if you want you can bring a friend
with you so that you can help each other
out and give opinions because I know
that every single time I pick up clothes
always liked by my mom look what I chose
shred use this this this this I
personally just like bringing my mom
because I feel like if I bring a friend
with it's kind of like competition you
know because it's like there's one of
each clothing item in there and it's
like if someone finds someone cute it's
like oh like beat you like I got the
cute dress you know I mean like I don't
know I feel like that's how I feel like
it would be if I brought a friend it
might be kind of competition so I just
like bringing my mom but you know if
you're not like that competitive and
stuff like that and you don't really
care about that stuff then definitely
bring a friend with you because they'll
help you know help you choose what you
should get and like your opinion there
give their opinions and stuff like that
um see also you always want to check for
rips stains or holes in like clothing
and you want to check for that because
sometimes the stores they can give you
that sometimes they can give you
discounts if you you know go up to like
the cashier and you're like okay well
look this one has like a big hole in it
and sometimes it'll be like oh i'll give
you like five dollars off
like something like that so definitely
you know think about that because some
stores do do that which is always great
um what else okay so when you're
shopping try to think of it as a
treasure map or like a treasure hunt I
know that's kind of weird but if you
don't take your time and try to look
through everything you won't find the
treasure is get it so yeah you always
want to look through every single thing
because that's really when you're going
to find the jackpot so just kind of
think of it as like a treasure hunt um
what else ok this is this applies to
pretty much most stores maybe not all of
them but definitely try to go earlier in
the week like monday tuesday because a
lot of stores except like donations and
um like except clothing from other
people on the weekends because usually
people drop off their stuff on the
weekends so definitely come earlier in
the week because you don't really want
to go on a friday because then it's like
all right everybody has basically bought
through all the cute stuff that entire
week and now you're just left with like
the uglier stuff you know so you
definitely want to go like earlier in
the week um what else ok so another one
is visit a bunch of stores around your
town so you can kind of find your
favorite store i have gone i have like
shocked at least like 20 different
thrift stores my entire life and I have
like two favorites you know so it's it's
great to kind of like have a variety of
different clothing stores you know cuz
like you'll you'll automatically know
when and which one is your favorite
stuff like that so I have two favorites
I have this one place that is really
really big and I love it and everything
is so cheap there but it's like pretty
far away so we barely gone there we go
there like maybe like every two months
or every other month or something like
that i don't know but i actually just
went to one yesterday it was plato's
closet and I know that that's like all
around us a I think or something like
that because i know that bureaus go
there I've seen like a couple make calls
from there and i love plato's closet i
am going back there today with a
hundred-dollar bill because i didn't
bring enough money
time and I only got three things and I
wanted to get the entire store like I
love plato's closet because when you
walk in it's just like it just looks
like a real it just looks like a
boutique like it's a little bit more
expensive than like other their source
because for example this dress was like
twelve or fourteen dollars which is
still kind of expensive but you know
still really cheap compared to the
original price but I just fell plato's
closet because I it's so clean there and
it's so nice and it smells good because
sometimes their stores can kind of smell
like pumpkin you'll be like but it's
most so good so definitely if you have a
plato's closet go on their website and
check if there's any stores near you
because you will love okay so anyways
the last one is this is the last tip
that I have and it's always washed
before you wearing because you don't
really know how many people have worn
this you don't know like you don't know
if the store washes them or not and
stuff like that so definitely it's okay
to like to try them on in the store like
I really don't care about that that
doesn't matter um but you definitely
before you you know like put in your
closet where like whatever as much as
you want you always want to make sure
they wash it just because just because
you never really know if the people
before they gave it to soar washed it or
you don't have the store wash it plus
you just don't know if it's dirty and
stuff like that and it's still sometimes
has like that smell to it um what's it
called so for example I just wash this
last night because I got it yesterday um
and that's pretty much it i guess i hope
you guys enjoyed this video and i will
definitely soon make a collective thrift
store haul i'm so excited for it
definitely recommend to do it you know
ask your mom be like mom do you want to
do this with me and I'm sure she'll say
yes unless she's like grossed out by the
idea that you're basically wearing
people's hand me downs I guess um but
yeah that's basically it for today's
