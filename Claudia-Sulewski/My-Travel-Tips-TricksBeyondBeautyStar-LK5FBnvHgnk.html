going to be leaving for California to
attend la IMATS I decided that I want to
film a travel related video for you guys
because spring break is rolling around
the corner so hopefully this video will
be a little helpful for you guys I don't
know everything down in my handy little
leather book ok wrong page travel tip
number one is to use the straws when
you're packing your necklaces that
probably sounds really weird but it
saves you a lot of time and a lot of
stress so next time you're packing all
of your necklaces and just throwing them
into some random container think again I
definitely recommend that you guys try
looping your necklace chains through
straws because it prevents from your
necklaces tangling and getting into all
these big knots aka it saves time trying
to untie all them and when your
necklaces are ready to use you just take
the straw and take it out of the straw
put it around your neck and you're good
to go and if you have any smaller like
choker necklaces that would fit around a
big straw you can always cut the straw
and have to make it smaller so travel
tip number two for those of you who just
hate folding clothes or you want to
avoid getting those like defined creases
in your clothes because you're folding
them then I definitely recommend rolling
at your clothes into little cinnamon
rolling things I like to do this a lot
with like tank tops or just random
little shirts and stuff all you have to
do is just fold it in half once you
don't actually you don't have to fold it
if you want to and then you just roll it
up and place it into your suitcase and
for those of you who hate folding or
just aren't like good at it this can
actually be a very good alternative to
folding because it will save you a lot
of space you just stack all of the rolls
on top of each other my next tip might
seem a very obvious and simple but it is
to tape all of your products that may
spill and I could tell you from
experience it is very easy for your
lotion to get everywhere in your
suitcase if you don't tape it shut this
one's pretty self-explanatory but if you
have any products that lock in place
never trust that lock in place
disclaimer because it always ends up
unlocking your suitcase somehow so if
you have any products that lock and
don't really close the product they
don't have any caps then I definitely
recommend placing some tape over the
holes or even if you have any capped
like products you can just tape over the
cap to make sure that doesn't fall off
while it's traveling this little trick
can potentially save lots of spillage
that could happen or loss of product so
I definitely recommend doing that but
next tip is just a little thing that my
mom used to always remind me when I was
packing back in the day but if you have
any items that are super white like my
shirt or just really light and delicate
clothing that maybe have you know
sequins coming off of it or any other
extra like fabrics and stuff anything
that you just don't want to get damaged
then I definitely recommend to just flip
it inside out before you put it to your
suitcase and once again it's just one of
those simple things that you just don't
like think about when you're packing
because it's just one of those really
simple things that everyone just kind of
forgets about when they're packing so if
you have any white shorts or pants or
anything just flip them inside out and
kind of put them all together in one
place and you're good to go my next tip
is a great space saver and that is to
stuff your boots with whatever you're
packing I like to personally put in any
like socks or tights or anything like
that I just stuff that into my boots
because a it's safe space because either
way your boots will be taking up that
room so you might as well fill them up
and also it helps to keep the shape of
your shoes so if you have any tall boots
that crease or anything like that it's
great to stuff them because they will
keep its form while storing some of your
socks or underwear or whatever you want
to put in your shoes
so I've got one last tip for you guys I
know I'm kind of lame I don't really
have a lot but you know what these are
just stuff that I use other than that I
just packed normally I'm not a packing
genius I have a few but my last one is a
specific way that I like to fold my
jackets into my suitcase and my mom
actually showed this to me because
although I am gifted with packing
clothes I always seem to have troubles
folding my jackets or any like really
any big bulky jacket so my mom actually
taught me this really cool and specific
way of folding them and ever since I've
learned how to do it I have been using
this technique pretty much every single
time I go on vacation or on a trip
somewhere so I'll be having a little
video rolling but basically what you do
is you take the jacket and you flip one
of the sleeves inside out then you tuck
that sleeve into the other sleeve I kind
of have the jacket fold in itself and
then I just like to fold the sleeve over
the jacket and fold the jacket in half
that was really weird to explain without
actually doing it I had to do to my
memory and I haven't done in a very long
time but I'm pretty sure that is how it
works we I do that with all of my
jackets when I have to fold or pack them
into a suitcase and it seems to work
with any size or material or length so
it always works which is nice because
it's kind of like a 100 certain proof
method that will not bring you down so I
definitely recommend trying it out but
it's just a great way to you know fold
your jacket save some space and yeah
well that is everything that I wrote in
my little book I'm trying to think if I
have any other on the top of my head
tips
I just thought of another one you go
Glenn Claudia it has to do with the
Rings because when you're traveling and
throwing your rings into your jewelry
containers and stuff they always end up
just being all over the place and then
you can't find them and you lose them so
if you have any like really simple
bracelets or what I like to do these I
remember I did this last time I traveled
I have these little cheetah printed like
fabric hair curlers that have snaps on
both ends and they snap together so
anything that just closes into one piece
then I think it's a great idea to loop
your rings through whatever your object
is and then close it shut and you will
have all of your rings in one place and
then you can just flip them off when you
are ready to use them so you can do this
with a necklace or a bracelet or a hair
curling thing like I do men my my
creativity juices are just flowing let's
see if anything else comes out of this
mouth I think I spoke too soon can't
really think of anything I think I'm
gonna end off taste food here can't
really think of anything else so that is
it for all my little tips and tricks on
hacking when you're going on vacation or
whatever so I hope you guys find this
video somewhat helpful and I hope you
guys enjoyed it also comment down below
and let me know if you guys like the
lighting in today's video because I
actually got new studio lights
thank you Jesus because I hated my
umbrella lights so much and I don't know
why I took me this long to buy new ones
but I got these three softbox lights
from Amazon I'll link them down below if
you guys are interested in making videos
or if you guys don't know what to get
but I got these softbox lights and I
have three in front of me and they're
very bright and
as of right now the viewfinder looks
promising so I'm excited about that but
I'm gonna go edit this video now because
I want to see how the lighting turned
out and yeah okay I'm going to stop
talking and I will see you guys for a
new video very soon wait and most
importantly the fake cigarette oh my god
okay I must say though I did have a
pretty convincing and impressive smoking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
