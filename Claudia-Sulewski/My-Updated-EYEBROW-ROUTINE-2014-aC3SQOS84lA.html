to be talking about a very important
topic very important in my life it is
eyebrows yes ladies we are talking about
eyebrows today I get so many questions
and comments asking about how I do my
eyebrows how I shape my eyebrows and
just in general
Pyrus and receive a lot more attention
than my actual self I take pride in that
eyebrow game is a real thing in my book
so before I get into what I actually do
with my eyebrows every single day let's
just talk about them for a little bit
the importance of them the origin of
them no we're not going to take it that
far I do want to stress you guys how
much eyebrows impacts your look entire
face they're honestly like my number one
thing that I always have to have down on
my face I can go out and hang out with
friends with completely no makeup on but
I always remember to fill in my eyebrows
I don't know I'm just grown emotionally
attached to them I don't feel like
myself when I don't have my eyebrows on
so they have just become a very
important aspect in my everyday life
style jack is literally standing out on
the patio looking through my window
watching me film right now now that I
admitted to my obsession and feelings
with eyebrows let's just get into what I
actually do with them the first thing
that I like to do with my eyebrows is
shape them and I don't do this every
single day because my eyebrow hairs
don't grow that fast so I like to do it
usually once or twice a week and all I
do to shape and sculpt my eyebrows is
tweeze them I actually never get my
eyebrows done I've always just had trust
issues with getting my eyebrows done
I've gotten the wax once and they
actually turned out really good but ever
since then I still just cannot grow the
courage and actually get
professionally done but honestly I'm
fine with just tweezing them and I've
kind of worked out a system for my
eyebrows so all that I do to shake my
eyebrows is just tweeze around them and
I always have pretty much the same shape
though all I really have to do is just
tweeze out any sparse ones that are not
you know lined up with the shape that I
want and it's a pretty simple process
I just tweeze them every few days that
is what I do to keep up with the shape
and just keep them clean looking and
groomed so now it is time to actually
fill in your eyebrows and I only use two
products when doing this because I've
just created a really fast and simple
method that I find just works everyday
for me I don't think you have to get too
complicated and use a bunch of different
products I found that using the two
products that we'll be talking about
today just work for me so the first one
that I use is the benefit browsing zuv
brow shaping kits this is in the shade
dark and this is the darkest one I think
they have three different shades there's
light medium dark that go figure and in
this little kit you have a gel and a
powder I personally only use the powder
because the gel on this kit is a little
bit too dark for my brows and it'll look
a little too fake but I like to use the
powder because it is the perfect shade
and it matches with my natural hair and
I also find that just using powder to
begin with is easier for me personally
this kit also comes with a mini angled
brush as well as many tweezers I
actually lost the tweezers but I do use
the little brush every single day I find
that it works perfectly for me it's the
perfect size I start off by grabbing my
little brush dipping it into the powder
and filling in at the bottom of my
eyebrows so I start kind of more towards
the front and then work my way back and
then once I kind of create that defined
line underneath my eyebrow then I'll
start going in and filling in the rest
of my eyebrow so I'll start going up and
then eventually I will drag it out to
the end of my eyebrow when I'm doing
this I make sure to use really small
strokes to blend out the powder and make
the
look a little more natural and that's
really all that I do for this step I
just kind of follow my natural brow and
just make things a little bit more sharp
and clean-cut looking so after filling
in my eyebrows with the powder I like to
grab a clean spoolie and just quickly
brush it over my eyebrows I find this
helps to just blend to everything out
especially in the front of my eyebrows
because I don't like having that like
defined line I kind of blend it out and
just make it go into my eyebrows if that
makes sense that did make sense after
that I go in with my second and final
product and this is the Maybelline brow
drama sculpting brow mascara I'll show
you guys what it looks like when you
pull it out the little spoolie looks
really cool it has a little ball shape
on the end so this is called the ball
brush and then inside you've just got
the tinted gel I personally use this
shade deeper Brown because it just
happens to match my brows perfectly and
you can definitely use this by itself
without filling your eyebrows beforehand
in order to do that you can just start
out by sweeping the brush across going
against the grain of your hair kind of
filling in your eyebrows and then sculpt
your brows by going with the grain of
your hair and with the contour of your
eyebrows all I do is just glide it over
my eyebrows and I find that the gel kind
of locks my hair into the place that I
want it to be and it just keeps the
shape and then my hair doesn't move
around or anything like that throughout
the day this tutorial seems so fast and
simple but this is honestly what I do to
my eyebrows every single day I just
found that these two products worked
great for me the only other thing I
could think of is highlighting my brow
bone but I like to do that when I apply
on my eyeshadow so that changes every
single day but these are the two
products that I consistently always use
on my eyebrows even if I'm not wearing
any makeup before you guys go make sure
to check out Maybelline City that will
be linked in the downbar for more beauty
tutorials and tips and tricks and also
at Maybelline's a theme for this month
was up off your brow game so that's why
I decided to kind of talk about my every
Brown routine and this video is also
super requested so I hope you guys enjoy
today's video and don't judge me for my
obsessive feelings towards filling in my
eyebrows I just really enjoy it and I
love it so we all have our passions and
hobbies I was born to be a brow filler
this is getting out of hand
I should really end this video soon okay
that is it for today's video I hope you
guys enjoyed it be sure to give it a
thumbs up and I will talk to you guys
very soon bye
