showing you guys how to survive a
weekend getaway with your friends
girlfriends besties etc and I'm gonna do
that by showing you guys what I like to
do before the trip as well as what I
like to bring it with me so my first tip
it would have to be a do-it-yourself
at-home hair mask and the one that I'm
gonna be showing you guys today is super
simple it only has two ingredients but
you're most likely going to damage your
hair a lot from the heats and the
chlorine if you end up going swimming so
it's good to kind of moisturize your
hair before you go so let's go see how I
created my at-home hair mask all you're
going to need is one egg and some
coconut butter or coconut oil so start
off by grabbing one or two spoonfuls of
the coconut butter I already started to
melt mine before this step but if you
want it to be a little more melted then
you can always just throw into the
microwave for a few seconds after that
crack in one egg into your mixture and
start whisking it together with a fork
then all you have to do is apply on the
hair mask all over your head wait 30
minutes then wash it out in the shower
my next step would have to be shaving
your legs and I like to do this
overnight before I leave for my trip so
that you can have super smooth and silky
legs for the entire weekend
so the shaving gel that I like to use
when I shave my legs is the skintimate
moisturizing Mandarin first shaving gel
that only does this stuff smell like the
bomb.com
but it also helps to moisturize and
protect your skin leaving on very smooth
and silky along with my skintimate
shaving gel I like to use the Quattro
for women a razor and they totally go
with the same color scheme did I do it
on purpose you will never know this
razor gives a very close and smooth
shave so it's nice because you're able
to go a few days without shaving your
legs and I'll still feel like the first
day every last step that I like to do to
pamper myself is of course paint the
nails so on my fingers I actually use in
nail stickers which is such a fun way to
kind of spice up your nail art
so for my nails I use the nail Rock nail
wraps I only use two of the stickers to
apply on my middle finger and my thumb
and then I just threw on some white nail
polish to the rest of my nails so now
I'm gonna get into the things that I
personally would bring to my weekend
getaway and this is excluding the more
obvious stuff like clothes and your cell
phone so let's just hop into it first
off I always like to carry sunscreen
around with me and this is the Hawaiian
Tropic shear touch ultra radiance lotion
sunscreen I said that really weird but
this sunscreen protects softens and
leaves your skin radiant and it actually
does that because it has these little
pigments in it they reflect light and it
makes your skin look all glowy and stuff
and this sunscreen is also non greasy
and water resistant so I've got the SPF
31 because I usually like to stick
between 30 and 50 next up I always like
to bring something to read with me in
case we're going to the beach or the
pool so I like to bring my iPad because
I use iBooks next up you've always got
to bring some bathing suits with you
obviously so I've got a pair with me and
it's my favorite bathing suit the
bottoms are four packs on and the top is
from Victoria's Secret speaking of
swimming and being in the water
sometimes mother nature decides hey it's
gonna be your time of the month and
you're gonna have your period so of
course you have to bring some sort of
lady protection with you and I've got
the Playtex sport tampons these are
specifically designed for bodies in
motion so you can still run around and
have fun in the Sun while you're on your
period which is great next up I always
like to bring some sort of deodorant and
this is the clear gel secret scent
expressions deodorant and this is a nice
scent ooh la la lavender love it smells
great I love the gel deodorant after
that I always like to bring some sort of
snack with me whether you're driving
around you're on the road so my first
snack is
a bag of pistachios and I personally
find these to be very fun to eat so I've
just got a bag of those and of course
some gum this is the extra dessert
delights sugar-free gum and this is a
new flavor
peach cobbler which is amazing lastly I
always like to bring a few makeup
products with me so I've got this makeup
bag right here and first off I like to
bring my covergirl LashBlast volume
waterproof mascara which is great
because this stuff will not move around
or budge next up I have the Nivea lip
butter in a raspberry rose kiss which
you guys know I love so so so so much so
I literally cannot leave the house
without this I've also got my benefit
Big Easy BB cream which is great for
kind of on-the-go coverage to quickly
apply to your face any less products and
here is my benefit browsing palette
which is super small and compact so it's
perfect for traveling so that is
everything that I like to do before I go
on a trip and what I like to bring with
me so that is it for today's video and
I'll talk to you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
