quick video and this has been pretty
requested for from couple girls and it
is how I study and I decided to put this
on my main channel because I decided
that the main channel is mostly just
about giving advice to you girls and
guys and just like me telling you guys
how I like helping you guys giving you
guys advice you know so this video is
going to be very very quick and sorry
for the little mess over there I was
just kind of I don't know which is kind
of messy over there but um yeah so only
have a couple of tips on how I study I
mean I'm not really a very hardcore
study or like I don't know I probably
and one of those people that just kind
of like crimson at the end which is a
really bad thing to do but not good not
gonna lie that's kind of how I am but
yeah I'm just going to tell you guys a
couple of tricks that I like to study so
the first thing is definitely flashcards
I don't do these for every test just
because it's like a lot of uses up a lot
of paper but when you have really big
tests like ended the chapter tests and
stuff like that flashcards are
definitely a great way or idea to study
whatever you have to like for example
let's say I had a huge spanish test so
that's going to be my example of this
video so let's say you know I have to
know all the vocabulary for this test
and let's say one of the words was cool
okay so basically what i would do is i
want to write school the one side and
escuela on the other so i have like
school escuela and then you know i'll
make a bunch of flashcards and then i'll
test myself would be like school is a
school oh yeah I'm right you know what
pretty basic I think a lot of people do
this kind of trick so definitely doing
this and another thing that I really
like doing and this is more of a greener
way to study because you're not using up
a bunch of pieces of paper and that is a
dry erase board definitely love studying
on dry erase boards just cuz first of
all come on who doesn't like writing or
drawing on Diaries boards it's really
fun so I've got this little blue one
that matches in my room I think it's
really cute and I'll use this for
studying so for example be like Spanish
example or whatever all right like I'll
study all the words then I'll test my
scuffs myself oh I cannot talk today
I'll test myself and I'll write like
school line and then I'll like write a
bunch and then I'll like answer them or
whatever so you're basically like making
your own little self test on the light
board so I think that's also a great
idea and I know that a lot of problem
like many you guys have the problem of
not being able to memorize things which
is like the main problem with like doing
good on tests and stuff is that you have
to remember things and memorize things
and honestly the way that i memorize
things is by making little like maybe
jokes or just ways for me to memorize it
like they can be really really random
and somehow like maybe I'll think if I
have to know that let's say for example
the color I have to know the color white
and the color white is Blanca and in
Spanish so for example for me to
memorize that let's just say okay I have
a best friend named bianca and that kind
of sounds like Blanca and this isn't
true but let's just say her favorite
color was white then I would know
Blanco's white because bianca so your
color is white like I remember just kind
of like little things and like tips and
like different ways of how I think helps
me memorize things if you guys and I'm
saying like it's really really weird
because for example when I had to know
all the amendments
one of them was the eighth one was bail
and punishment I'm pretty sure yeah and
the way I remember it is on a calculator
the word the letter B and eight is looks
the same you know what I mean how be
like a uppercase B and an eighth kind of
look the same so that's how to remember
that bail and punishment is the Eighth
Amendment if you guys and I'm saying
like there's such weird things that
that's how help myself remember things
but yeah this is how I like to study
definitely at least start studying a
week before the test that's what I try
to do but you know there's those days
there's those tests that I just cram
everything in the last minute and not a
very good idea so make sure just
practice practice practice every single
day just a little bit of more
information it's probably the smartest
way to study so yeah that's about it for
this little video hope this helped you
guys and that you guys will use my
little studying skills not skills um
steps yeah so I'll see you guys for
another video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
