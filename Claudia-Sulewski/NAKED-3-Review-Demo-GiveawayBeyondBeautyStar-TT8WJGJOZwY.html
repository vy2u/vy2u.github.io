and giving you guys a little demo on the
new Urban Decay Naked 3 palette i'm also
going to be comparing this to the two
previous palettes and give you guys a
quick little tutorial at the end of the
video also be sure to stay tuned to the
end of the video if you guys would like
to win your own and they get 3 palette
because i bought an extra for you guys
so if you want to find out how you can
win one of these be sure to watch the
entire video so first we're going to
start off with the packaging of the
naked 3 palette so this is what it comes
in the packaging is super sleek and nice
and it gives you a little preview of
what you're about to see so let me just
open it up this is what the palette it's
okay it's upside down this is what the
palette looks like so let me just
compare them to the first two so on the
top we've got the first pallet be second
and then the third so as you can see the
newest one resembles to the second one a
lot so it does have that plastic hard
packaging which I personally like a lot
more than the first one which is like
felt kind of it's also got some texture
to it which I thought was a really nice
detail so that's what it looks like the
first word that pops into my head as I
open this palette was pink which I was
so excited about as you can see all of
these eyeshadows have hints of pink in
them they're very warm and soft looking
which I love so much so this palette
definitely gives you that like romantic
warm kind of vibe which is so different
from the other two I really think or
indicate killed it with this palette so
now we're going to show you guys a
little comparison between the other two
so if you don't know what the first and
second palette look like I have them
right here the one on the top is the
first one and the bottom is the second
one and obviously there are a few warmer
colors in here but I feel like the
majority of these two pallets have kind
of colder and more golden tome shadows
so I see definitely more hints of like
gold and yellow so when you compare them
with the third
you guys can see that the third one
definitely has a lot more warmer tones
to it it's a lot more pink year so color
wise the third palette was very
refreshing to see because it is so
different from the first two which I
believe look very very similar now that
I'm looking at it so that was really
nice to see that they switched it up and
completely went on the opposite side of
like the color wheel as far as the
quality of the eyeshadows go I think
they're very good quality they're the
same exact quality as the first two I
think that urban decay eyeshadows are
very pigmented very smooth and they last
your entire day I was definitely not
disappointed with the quality of these
eyeshadows although I did want to
mention one thing some of the glittery
eye shadows in this palette alright
necessarily chunky or anything like that
but I have noticed especially with dust
which is the lightest glittery eyeshadow
in here it creates a lot of fallout so
you definitely have to kind of wipe it
off your cheeks once you're down here I
makeup look and I also notice that if
you don't use an eye primer dust it
doesn't really stay on your eyes as well
as the other eyeshadows do so it tends
to kind of fall off but it's not really
a problem with me because I feel like
it's just so common knowledge to wear
like an eyeshadow primer I feel like
everyone does it so as long as you do
that you're completely fine I mean I do
it with all of my eyeshadows and i kind
of consider it just like an essential
step with eyeshadow primer all of these
are perfect but keep in mind if you
don't use on shadow primers then be more
glittery like chunky I shadows they kind
of wear off during the day but other
than that these are super pigmented and
smooth and I'm really really impressed
with their eyeshadows
I'm starting out by taking burnout and
applying it onto the inner half of my
eyelids I'm then going in with liar and
applying it on the outer half of my eyes
to darken up my crease I'm taking the
shade nooner and buffing it in with a
big fluffy brush I'm then going in with
the shade factory and applying that into
my crease as well after that I'm using
black heart and applying it on the outer
half of my eyes and just a little bit
into my crease to darken up the look
I'm also taking that same eyeshadow and
bringing it down onto my lower lash line
to add some sparkle into the look I'm
taking dust and lightly patting it all
over my lids I'm then going in and
highlighting my brow bone and inner tear
duct with strange after that I'm just
finishing off my look with some eyeliner
and mascara
