channel today's video is going to be a
no makeup makeup look
aka what I'm wearing on my face right
now definitely wearing quite a bit of
makeup yeah it took some effort to get
here but the whole point of it is to
make it look super simple and dewy and
fresh and natural nothing crazy also
super excited about all the products
that I mentioned and use because a lot
of them I've never used in past
tutorials be sure to hit that Bell
notification so that you are notified
every single time I upload a video and
if you're not subscribed then I would
love for you to join the family I will
have my vlog Channel and my Instagram
link down below if you guys want to keep
up with me more and I'm just gonna stop
talking and actually get into it step
one is to prime your face I'm using
makeup Forever's hydrating primer and
applying on a very thin layer all over
my face I don't want to look too full
coverage so I'm gonna be mixing at my
foundation with this fresh face instant
glow Luminizer from fresh it basically
just makes your face super glowy and so
I just mix those two I apply it with a
foundation brush and then I go in and
with a damp sponge and blend it a lot
now I'm going in with a little bit of
concealer to highlight for the most part
but also kind of get rid of any like eye
bags or imperfections I'm using the
Tarte shaped tape in the shade medium
light and this stuff is so so good
definitely goes a long way so I don't
like to use too much of it
you guys will notice that I'm using a
lot of cream products for this look I
feel like it just helps to like melt
into your face and look natural so I'm
using the hoola kwikki contour stick and
I'm basically just going in and
contouring certain areas in my face and
then immediately blending it out because
we don't want to be streaky we want to
blend it right away so I'm just doing
the usual areas as well as a little bit
on my eyelids okay so this might be my
favorite product at the moment it is the
glossy a cloud paint in the shade dust
and I've been using it for blush so I
just dab in with my fingers and I think
it looks so natural and perfect cuz I
don't like to go overboard with it would
you look at that another cream product
I'm using this tarte twinkle stick in
the shade spotlight and I'm just going
in and adding it to the tops of my
cheekbones bridge of my nose Cupid's bow
office spots we're hitting all of them
you'll see I highlight a bunch in this
look
so of course you have to set everything
I like to use my Laura Mercier
translucent setting powder I don't
really like baking and I feel like it
looks a little intense but I do like to
pack it on with a sponge underneath my
eyes and then for the rest of my face I
just lightly dust it over you do not
want to go too overboard and lose that
like doing this so after that I'm using
my makeup forever brow palette in the
shade 2 and with deep concentration as
you can see literally had to put my hair
up I did my brows and then I forgot
something so then I grabbed it and it is
my benefit ready set brow which is
incredible I don't know why I just
recently started setting my brows but it
just helps to keep everything in place
so I just brush them through and yeah
that's what I'm doing I don't want to
add too much to my eyes because it is a
no makeup makeup look but I am going to
add a little bit of powder highlighter
so that the Sun catches it and you know
something's there but you can't really
tell so I'm adding it to my brow bone
and my inner tear duct and just a little
bit on like the center of my lids now
I'm just going in and curling my lashes
and then apply on some mascara this is
the black magic mascara from the brand
Aiko and I'm super obsessed with it
so yeah make sure you don't like take it
on too much you know we're trying to
look natural next up I'm putting on just
a little bit of bronzer nothing crazy
little bronzer never hurt nobody so I'm
just going to my cheekbones temples jaw
stuff like that blend it in don't make
it obvious
and then yeah we're gonna go in with
more highlighter the reason why I like
this one so much and this it's in the
shade resilience is because it is so
natural and buildable it's not like to
blinding or too crazy and then we're
gonna finish off the lips with some SPF
chapstick from fresh I'm obsessed with
it so we're just applying that and then
the last and most important thing ever
is adding a finishing spray technically
this is a priming water but also you can
use it to set your makeup and I
a lot on Soho yeah that's it we're done
that is it for today's video I really
hope you guys enjoyed it it's been a
while since I made a tutorial with like
