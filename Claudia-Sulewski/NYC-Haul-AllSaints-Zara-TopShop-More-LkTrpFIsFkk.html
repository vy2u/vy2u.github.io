doing my New York City Hall because I
just recently went to New York for
Fashion Week and I was there for two
weeks so obviously I did quite a bit of
shopping I've got a lot of things to
show you guys so I'm just gonna keep
this intro very sweet and simple and
just get on with the haul I realized
that I got a lot of pants while I was on
this trip which is good because you know
it's getting colder outside first off I
got two pants from All Saints the first
pair look like this they're just black
biker cropped skinny jeans and I thought
they were really pretty because they're
like a light gray color and they've got
all of these stitching's kind of going
on right here and there's a good supply
at the bottom but they're also very very
like stretchy and comfortable so I'm a
very excited to be wearing these
throughout the fall in winter time and
then the other pair I got from All
Saints are black leggings but they're a
lot thicker so I kind of consider them
more as like pants I don't know they're
very thick but they kind of have that
same style as the previous pants I just
showed you guys it's a little rig to
where the knees are and then there's
just some like stitching detailing at
the bottom you just keep everything
together and nice-lookin it so I just
really like how these look on I also got
three pairs of pants from H&amp;amp;M which this
is my first time actually getting pants
from there and I was very very surprised
and impressed with their jeans the first
pair I got were these distressed kind of
medium washed boyfriend jeans these fit
perfectly I love how they're like baggy
but not too baggy so these are in the
size 26 to 32 so they're pretty large at
the top but that's like what I like so
basically they're just very baggy at the
top and then they just get a little bit
skinny at the bottom and then I like to
cuff them so I'm very very happy and
excited about these boyfriend jeans then
I also got some simple black skinnies
just because they were super inexpensive
and they're very comfortable you can
never
have enough of black skinny jeans and
then the last pair I got kind of are
like the same-sex parents the great ones
that I got except these are in light
blue so they're just like these low
waist kind of moto looking skinny jeans
with like the ribs right here and stuff
like that so these look very cute on the
jeans at H&amp;amp;M are very affordable so I
definitely recommend checking them out
for pants next up I wanted to show you
guys one thing that I got from Zara and
I am in love with these they are these
tall black over-the-knee high-heeled
boots I likes them because at the top
you can see if they do not go past your
knee in the back they only do in the
front so they're very comfortable knee
wise that doesn't even make sense but it
just it works well because when you bend
your knee it doesn't like interfere you
know what I'm saying overall I'm very
pleased with these boots and I know that
I will get a lot of use out of these
while we're on the topic of shoes I
wanted to show you guys a pair of high
heels that I got from Aldo and these
were in the sales section so they were a
lot more inexpensive than the original
price but they look like this they're
white and they're so funky looking
that's why I got them because they're
just so interesting so it just has a
white strap right here and then the
thicker strap at the top I don't even
know how to explain it but it has kind
of like this like pebble stone type of
pattern to it I don't know it looks
really cool and then the buckles on the
side right here have like really pretty
white hardware on them that just kind of
polished the look yeah I think these
heels are so cute and I just couldn't
resist when I saw them the next store I
went to was forever 21 and I was
actually very surprised with the things
that I found I really liked them and
yeah I just really haven't bought
anything from there and I'm very
time but overall I was very pleased with
what I was seeing in the stores so first
off I got this black dress Ali and I
both got it but it's like a striped
black dress it's very simple but if you
can see on the sleeves here they're a
little bit longer and they're also
see-through so you can see the stripes
but then you can also see like the mesh
behind it
so I thought this is just a really cute
dress for the fall and wintertime it
will be great for layering things
putting you know like sweaters over it
scars whatever so I think this will be
fun to play around with next up I got
two clutches because I only own one so
why not buy more right if you first
clutch I got looks like this it's black
all the way around with a white flap and
a little gold buckle right here so I
thought it was a very interesting clutch
it also has a gold chain and I just
think it looks really cool so I got that
one then I also got this simple black
clutch with a gold kind of detail going
right here and I just thought it was one
of those like essential bags that you
need when going out so it just has a
gold chain and it's just very simple so
I like that a lot
and then the last thing that I got from
forever 21 was this sweater I don't know
if it's supposed to be a dress but I got
it in a size large and it looks so good
on as a dress basically it's just very
simple and grey and that it has cop
sleeves I already wore this in New York
because I was so excited about it but it
looks really good with like black
booties and sheer black tights and like
a black clutch aka this one and like
some necklaces so overall I'm just very
happy with this and I think it'll be
really fun to you know try out with
different outfits and stuff so that is
everything that I got from forever 21
next up we've got Topshop it sounded
like there was supposed to be like a
commercial break like next up we've got
top shops stay tuned I only got two
things from there and I wore these both
to Fashion Week together actually so
first off I got this baby pink beaded
skirt which is so pretty and also
ridiculously expensive but it was
that because it was professionally so
it's like a mid-length skirt it goes
past the knees but it's not like a maxi
skirt and as you can see it just has
beading going all the way down and then
there's a skirt underneath it just looks
very classy and kind of like
old-fashioned looking and then paired
with this skirt I wore this black really
really fuzzy furry cropped sweater so it
just looks like this and I thought that
they complement to each other really
well kind of since they're like
opposites in a way but yeah I just wore
this little cop sweater with it and it
looks really cute so that is all that oh
I also got flats from Topshop I'm not
I'm gonna show them to you guys they're
just black flats and they are literally
the devil I wore them for 10 minutes
while I was there and they make both my
heels start bleeding so I don't even
wear them I've been trying to get my mom
to wear them to pretty oh man and she's
like no I can't do this so yeah that's
that um the next item I got was from
Free People and actually did not get
this in New York I got it before I went
to New York but I did bring it with me
and wear it well is there so I thought
it was appropriate but it's just this
black kind of not really floppy hat it's
a little bit more structured but it's
just a black simple hat and I didn't
have one and I wanted one so I got one
my next two items are from go Jane calm
and these actually came in the mail
while I was in New York so once again I
thought this kind of you know went well
with this video but yeah I just got two
things from go Jane first off I got this
jacket right here because I'm planning
on doing like a lookbook kind of styling
like different jackets and different
styles and stuff so this is going to be
one of the jackets that I'm going to be
featuring I am so freaking obsessed with
this jacket so the style of it is kind
of like a bomber jacket so it looks a
little bit more sporty but since it does
have like the baby pink it kind of you
know makes it look a little bit more
girly so it's got this like white and
black pattern going all the way around
on the front of
and then it has these black faux leather
quilted sleeves with the baby pink
details at the top and bottom so I think
this jacket is just really fun it's
it'll be fun
where I also got a pair of shoes from go
Jane comm so they look like this they're
black and they're heels
obviously so they have a skinnier strap
at the top and then a thicker one right
here and the interesting thing about it
is it kind of looks like snakeskin in a
way it's got like that pattern to it so
I thought that was a really cute touch
and then the toe of the shoe is just a
little bit pointed so I think if these
shoes are so sexy looking and I can't
wait to wear these at fancy little
dinners and stuff and look all
sophisticated with my pointy toed shoes
I'm sure all of you guys are wondering
if I stopped by brandy melville while I
was in New York and the answer to that
is obviously of course yes I realized
that that brandy melville is like the
mothership of beauty gurus but I don't
really care because I love their
clothing
so the first sweater I got looks like
this I don't know what this material is
called it's not like velvet but it's not
like cotton it kind of has like that I
mean I I really can't describe it but
it's just a black simple sweater and
yeah so I got that and then also I got
this long-sleeved kind of shirt slash
sweater it's like a very sheer thin one
but it's just tan and white striped and
it's very long so I like to wear this
tied with like a skirt or put over a
dress or something so I got that then I
also got this light pink romper and I
actually had this in black so I was so
excited to see this in the store because
I love the way this wrapper looks so it
has a very low kind of cross to be neck
in the front and it's just very flowy
next up I got a kimono of course because
they're just so in right now but my
kimono is just a blank simple one
because I thought you would
with a lot and I've already worn it lots
and lots of times the brainy stories
have recently been starting to sell like
vintage flannels so I decided to pick
one up it's just like a navy blue
grayish pattern and I think that's like
an extra-large like it's very big but it
looks really cute yeah I got that then I
also got this cream floral little tank
right here so I thought that was cute
next up I got this a black and white
floral dress and I just really fell in
love with like the stitching / like the
shape of this dress it's got like a
lining detail going on in the front and
of course it goes low in the back but
yeah I thought it was really cute and I
definitely think I'll wear this during
the fall time with like some boots and
some sheer black tights and a nice
little black sweater so yeah I thought
this was really cute Wow it is like
hardcore storming right now so I
apologize if you guys can hear the
Thunder in the background right before I
started filming my cat was actually
sleeping right here on the bed and it
was the cutest thing I was so excited
because I know how much you guys love
Francis but like the second I turn on
the camera I started Thunder starving
and now she's currently under my bed
which I don't even understand because my
bed is so low to the ground she had to
like completely like spread-eagle to get
underneath there but she's scared of
thunderstorms just really not having it
right now but I also got three pairs of
shorts so first off I got these shorts
right here which are so crazy and fun I
love the colors of these it's like a
periwinkle kind of blue with a
highlighter like green to it so these
are super fun
definitely not for fall and winter but I
bought them anyway that I just got two
pair of lace shorts because I've been
wanting lace shorts for like the longest
time but I
just never seemed to buy them but I'm
happy I waited because I really like how
these look on so I just got them in a
black pair very simple and then I also
got a cream pair so I think that is all
that I got in New York that is it for
