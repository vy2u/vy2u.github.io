talked to you guys in like two weeks and
I'm sorry about that but I will have a
vlog from New York coming up on my
second channel very soon I think I'm
gonna edit it tonight and also come up
below for any requests on video so you
guys want me to do so today I have a
haul from New York because I just went
to New York actually came back yesterday
I was there for three days because of
the bf EA Alliance it was like the goog
Lam Alliance vloggers event thing I
don't really know the entire title of it
but it was so much fun it was kind of an
event where a bunch of girls got to come
together and there was like getting your
nails done you could get your hair done
and you could get henna and I got one on
my hand and I finally got to met a bunch
of my friends here on YouTube and it was
just so awesome so on Friday we went
shopping for pretty much the entire day
and I don't really get that much so it's
not like that big of a haul but I
decided why not show you guys a haul
from New York City so first I'm gonna
start with Sephora I only got one thing
and it was only $5 but I got the
Pacifica Hawaiian Ruby guava body butter
and it's just like a little lotion I'm
gonna be using this for my hands and I'm
just gonna keep you in my purse and it
smells so good it smells like I don't
know it just smells really like tropical
E but like flowery and fruity all at
once I don't know it smells really good
but we all got it so I thought that was
really cute and yeah it was only $5
which was really awesome also you might
notice that the quality is a little bit
different I don't know in a good way or
in a bad way but right now I'm using my
Sony cyber-shot TX 10 I think it's
called and I'm using this just because
my other camera is out of battery right
now and also I noticed that this camera
like shows a lot more like it has like a
water range of you like you can see more
which I really like so yeah I'm just
trying out something new I don't know
but next up we went to Urban Outfitters
and I got two things first thing I got
from Urban Outfitters was a spaghetti
strapp shirt and I only spent $5.00 on
it which i think is so crazy I know that
there's like a huge sale going right now
and I thought that I was only gonna
spend $10 on it but on the little
receipt it says there was an additional
50% off so it was only $5 which is so
crazy and the shirt looks like this it's
like I don't know it's really outside of
my comfort zone of like my style but
it's like this creamy kind of off-white
beige color and it has a really
interesting pattern on it and I thought
I don't know so it looks like that
spaghetti straps and I think this would
look really cute with like maybe like
tucked into some kind of high-waisted
skirt or like with tucked into like
high-waisted jeans shorts or something
like that I don't know but it's really
kind of bohemian and hipsterish I guess
I hate saying that but it's kind of has
that hipster feel to it but yeah I've
never had anything like that so I was
like why not and then the other thing I
got which was kind of expensive and they
were my first pair of Tom's look just
let me show you guys to them this way
and I originally wanted to get the white
ones
kayla AKA doll here on youtube got the
white ones but they didn't have my like
size in them because i'm a 7.5 but we
did have grey ones and their last ones
and I think these are so cute they're
kind of rankles because they were shoved
into my suitcase and these were $48
which is pretty expensive but they were
so comfy and I think they're definitely
worth it then we all went to lush and
surprisingly this is the first time that
I've ever bought anything from lush I've
been there before but I've just I've
never really bought in things from there
I don't know why but I got four things
and I'm super excited
so I don't want to talk over the bag
really loud but I got three soaps and I
asked for each soap to be around $5
because you know they like cut it for
you for the price range that like you
asked so the first one is sexy peel and
this was six dollars and fifty cents and
this is like a pretty big chunk if you
ask me and this slide let me just open
up and show you guys so it looks like
this and this is actually a pretty big
slice for like six hours but it's just
yellow and it has little orange chunks
in it I don't really know what it is but
it smells so good it's super strong it's
very citrusy it smells exactly like a
lemon starburst and I'm super excited to
use this next soap I got was godmother
and this was five dollars and 67 cents
so this is how the soap looks and this
is also a pretty nice chunk and it
smells so good it's like super sweet and
fruity it smells a lot like swedish fish
or some kind of candy I don't know but
yeah it's just kind of like a dark
maroon reddish color and it smells so
good oh my goodness so the next soap is
the sea vegetable body soap and this was
$4 and a 68 cents and oh my goodness
this soap smells so freakin good hold on
let me just open it up you can already
smell it so it looks like this it's like
a turquoise e greenish blue I don't know
but on the bottom here they have it's
like I don't know what they put in here
it was like seaweed and sea salt so you
can actually use this side of the soap
to exfoliate your body like your knees
your elbows and stuff like that and it
smells so good it smells like I I can't
describe it it has like lavender in it
but then it also kind of just smells
like the ocean I don't know yeah this is
definitely one of my favorite scents of
all the soaps I don't know I think they
all smell super good but yeah I'm so
excited to use all of those and then the
fourth thing
Sindbad I got once the lush no trout dry
shampoo and this was $12 and you get so
much product I heard jc7 talking about
it and I've never had a dry shampoo
before so I decide to try this out and
it just looks like that it comes in that
kind of bottle and I don't know I'm
excited so it's only 12 bucks which is
actually a pretty good deal for all of
this yeah so then I only have three more
things to show you guys and it's all
from Victoria's Secret so my mom and I
wanted to buy a couple of things that
said New York City on them because you
know how Victoria's Secret always has
like their sweats and then it says like
your state's team and stuff like that so
we want to get a couple of things from
New York so the first thing is this
black little tote right here it has a
zipper and it also has a pocket inside
and it just says pink NYC one of the
reasons we bought this was because we
couldn't fit all this stuff into my like
luggage thing so we had to buy an extra
tote that i could bring onto the
airplane because my purse was too small
so we took this and I'll be using this
on planes from now on but it just says
pink and we see it's all sparkly and
glittery and this bag was fifty dollars
which is kind of expensive but it's
really cute so we couldn't say no so the
next thing is this little satchel right
here and it looks like this there was
only $20 which in my opinion is kind of
inexpensive for like a Victoria's Secret
little satchel and you guys are probably
thinking all right Claudia that's not
gonna match to a lot of stuff and the
number one reason I got this is because
where I live amusement parks are super
popular people go to amusement parks all
the time where I live and like the place
that we go to you can put your stuff
into little cubbies before you go on the
roller coaster but you know things need
to all line you could forget it so my
friends and I usually bring satchels and
then we'll like wear them while we're on
the ride and it's important to have one
that like you know zips off and it's
super safe so your stuff doesn't fly out
while you're going you know upside down
I never really had a satchel that could
like keep all my stuff protected so I'd
always put my stuff in my friend
satchels but I thought this one was
absolutely perfect and the strap is
adjustable and it just looks like that
and I don't know I thought it was really
cute so I'm definitely going to be using
this when we go to you know fun things
like that and then the last thing I got
were yoga pants because I do not own
like any I only have like one this is my
second pair but they just look like this
they're they're just black
you know simple and the band looks like
this it's just gray and it says I heart
pink I heart the Jets just as football
so yeah I got it because it has to do
with New York so that's like the main
reason why I got it but I thought it was
really cute and I think they'll go great
with just like a grey hoodie and stuff
like that so yeah plus I have grey X so
this will like naturally well and yeah
so I got that so that is it for my haul
I know it's kind of small but I still
want to show you guys what I got because
a couple of you guys were asking on
Twitter and also I will be uploading a
vlog from New York City on my second
channel so when it does come up then I
will put the link in the downbar but if
it's not up yet I will just like my
second channel in the downbar so that
you guys can subscribe to that channel
if you want to also I will be leaving my
Twitter and my facebook and all that
stuff so that is it for today's video
and I will talk to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
