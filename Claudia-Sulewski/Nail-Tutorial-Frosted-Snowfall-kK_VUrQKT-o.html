how to recreate this super easy nail
look for the holidays and winter time
you first want to start out by grabbing
any grade nail polish and applying two
coats all over your nails once you let
your nails completely dry go through
your nail polish collection and find any
grey silver sparkly nail polishes along
with a white one and you just want to
choose a couple of your favorites using
a cosmetic sponge and your white nail
polish I'm just using one from wet wild
you want to adapt at the Polish anywhere
on your nail I placed it in different
spots and every nail to switch it up you
can do it on the top bottom middle
anywhere now grabbing your first silver
color this one is from OPI I'm just
going to start dotting around on the
white nail polish using a dotting tool
grabbing my next silver gray nail polish
color I'm going to do the same exact
thing and I really liked this one
because it was a lot darker than the
other colors that i'm using so it made a
great contrast and then going back to
the White I'm just going to add some
more polka dots after you let your nails
dry just apply on your favorite top coat
if you want your nails to look even more
festive in sparkly you can add any and
nail gem I used to silver one and I
placed on my ring finger and my thumb
and that is all that you have to do for
the nail look I hope you guys enjoyed it
obviously it was very very easy but I
think it looks very cute and you will
get a lot of compliments on it so thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you guys later bye
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
