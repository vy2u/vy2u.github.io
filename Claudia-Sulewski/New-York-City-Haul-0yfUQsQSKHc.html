a haul from New York City now don't get
too excited because I don't have a lot
of stuff to show you guys I surprisingly
did not get that many things which is
kind of surprising cuz it's like come on
New York City but whatever so I'm just
gonna show you guys what I got New York
City
so the first thing that I got actually
didn't get in New York City but I did
get it like the day before I left so you
know what might as well just include it
and it is the Revlon just bitten lip
stain and this is my first lip stain I
think up that I've ever gotten um looks
like this it has a little marker tip on
one side and then it has a really nice
lip balm on the other side love the lip
balm it's really awesome this Clark just
stays on really well the only problem
with this is um it's really really dark
it's way way too dark for me I actually
swatched it earlier it looks like this
by the way this is in crave um yeah so
it looks like that just a very kind of
raspberry dark dark dark color if you
have dark lips this is gonna turn out
really really dark but yeah it's really
great quality just not the coffee so
starting now everything that I got is
from New York City okay so this is
actually like the main thing that I
bought and it's kind of like the most
expensive thing that I bought and it was
kind of like my guilty pleasure item
that I spent on I guess I don't know but
it's from Steve Madden I got shoes and I
know I am super duper delayed on this
trend it's been going for like what two
years now
and they're just nude pumps I know I'm
super delayed I think pretty much like
everybody owns a nude post by now but I
haven't owned any yet so these are my
first pair of new pumps and I think they
just go everything for you know family
Christmas parties and you know all that
good stuff
yeah so they just look like this they're
from Steve Matt and you were 20% off I
got them on black
so wasn't that great of a deal but they
ended up being like I don't even know I
ended up being like $70 or $80 or
something but yes they're kind of
expensive but they're super cute so you
know I like them so the next things that
I'm going to be showing right now are
all from forever 21 and this was during
my meet-up on Saturday which was so
awesome and so much fun
I was totally really really awkward in
the beginning but as you started to like
shop and stuff I think it it just became
a lot fun and we really didn't shop too
much we kind of liked migrated to one
little area on the store and then just
kind of stood there and talked and like
shop for like two seconds and then we
went over here and then we just like
talked and then shop for like two
seconds so we didn't really shop a lot
we didn't really go through the entire
store cuz that store has like five
floors and it was just super crazy and
yeah so I didn't get too much but I
don't know it was a lot fun so thank you
for everybody who got went to the Meetup
you guys were all so sweet and so nice
and so kind and it was so awesome and it
was just I don't know it was a really
awesome experience and I can't wait to
you know continue doing meetups in the
future okay so the first thing that I
got from drive to one is this dress and
at first when you look at your polishes
like that's an interesting dress and
that's that's what I thought about it
that's what my first thoughts were I
thought about it and I was like hey that
could look really really cute and I was
totally right it looks freaking smoking
on a body compared to on anger but it
just looks like this it has like a sweet
about what does it call the heart
neckline I think sweetheart neckline I
just love the colors they're so random
it's like a it's the colors kind of
weird in the video right now but it's
kind of like a fuchsia pink and then
it's like a bright yellow and then it's
just like navy blue and it's short and
it's kind of tighter and it just looks
so freaking cute I think I'm gonna wear
this for Easter because we always go to
the hotel for like brunch during for
Easter brunch so yeah I think I'm gonna
wear this for Easter because
really bright and yeah and so this dress
was in 1980 so the next thing I got was
just a shirt and it's all crinkles
because it was in my suitcase cuz I just
came through it and the cute thing about
this is it has kind of like that little
shoulder cutout detail on the side so it
has a hole right there and your shoulder
just kind of peeks through so it's
really cute it's really really loose
it's kind of like this shimmery enough
you can see the sparkles it's like a
shiny kind of beige champagne gray white
I don't know color I don't know it's
really cute though and it's just very
loose and this shirt was 1580 okay so
next I just got a couple of jewellery
items and I know I say that really
weirdly somebody commented about that
I see Julie instead of jewelry I don't
know why but it's like a thing but yeah
so the first jewelry item oh my gosh it
bothers me now okay
so the first item that I got accessory
were this little pack of bracelets and
they're super cute they're just like
diamond studded and pearls and kind of
silver and grey and stuff that are super
cute and I don't know that don't on the
prices process oh my gosh I don't know
the prices of these bracelets but I
think it was like 580 or like $6 it was
around five to six stars so not bad at
all then also I got a little set of
earrings and I'm obsessed with this it
was only 380 look at those earrings
they're super cute you've got like
silver diamonds and then you have white
roses and then like gray and then like
gray roses and black roses and just like
I don't know it's just super cute so the
last thing that I got and probably my
most favorite and you guys won't know
why in a minute it is this little
necklace right here so it's just a
simple gold chain and that it has a
vanity on the other side right there and
there's just like a little diamond for
the mirror so it's cute about this
necklace is during the Meetup all the
girls and I who came we all decided to
buy this necklace
so we can all kind of share one thing
that we all bought together and you know
I could always remember this as you know
the necklace that I bought you know
during my first meetup in New York City
and stuff like that and we just had so
much fun so I thought that was so cute
that we all bought the same necklace and
stuff like that and I don't know I love
it I'm gonna put it on right now that's
what I'm gonna do so that's it for my
haul
