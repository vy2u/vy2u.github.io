hope you guys come and yes let's just
get into the details I'm going to be in
New York for only three days it's not
really that long but whatever I had to
squeeze you know a meetup in there i
just had to so as for the details of the
meetup it's going to be on november 16th

three o'clock so it's going to be
november sit 26 three o'clock and it's
going to be at Times Square and I've
never really done this I don't know how
it looks but I hear that a lot of people
have to deal with security if you do it
in front of forever 21 so I'm going to
be doing it across from forever 21
apparently there's some sitting area
right across from forever 21 so that's
where the medium is going to be snacking
me in front of forever 21 just because I
don't want you know like security coming
there and be like what's going on is
this a flash mob or I mean I don't
really know what goes on but yeah so
it's going to be across the street right
across the street from forever 21 in
that kind of little sitting area
apparently i don't know i'm guessing
it's really noticeable and you will prob
see me so just I'm going to be in that
little forever 21 area so that's where
you'll find me don't really know what to
expect but yeah I guess just right
across the street so yeah that's

four hours who knows but yeah please

on my new york subscribers that'd be so
much fun I'm definitely gonna be really
really awkward but you know what it's
