you my little tutorial on how to
recreate the look that Nicki Minaj wore
in her Super Bass music video for the
boys at the top down with the cooling
system when you come up in a cloud baby
blazin up got EXO index like you say but
nothing any empty bales keep my dad at
they'll be back photos me okay so first
I'm gonna start out with Urban Decay's
eyeshadow primer potion and I'm just
going to apply this all over my lid then
I'm going to be taking this is jumbo
eyeshadow pencil in milk and I'm just
going to apply this all over the lid and
make sure you pack on a lot because this
will definitely break up a yellow
eyeshadow and of course don't forget to
blend it out anyway Brittany so now I'm
going to grab a Coastal Scents
ishow palette and choose brightest
yellow that I could find and just Pat
that all over your lid a bunch of times
until the yellow is breaking up
now you want to bring the color into
your crease but don't bring it out too
high just a little bit above the crease
you were the Queen Ricki Lake I noticed
that you make sure you add it into your
inner corner as well
this is the remix so now just grab any
dark brown eyeshadow or even just a
bronzers like what I'm doing and just
choose a big like puffy brush and just
apply that right above the yellow this
will kind of deepen up your eyes and
also it'll kind of give a more cleaner
cut to the yellow so now it's time to
work on a lower lash line I'm just going
to grab every Decay's eyeshadow primer
potion and apply that underneath and of
course you want to blend it out with
your finger so I'm going to go back to
the Coastal Scents palette and choose
the light baby pink at the top make sure
to tap off any excess and just apply
that on your lower lash line I'm also
going to dab a shout-out on my waterline
just make sure you don't get it in your
eye a great way to pull down your
waterline is just by pressing your
finger underneath it won't be tugging on
your eyes as much okay so now it's time
for the eyeliner I'm just going to grab
wet and while it's gel eyeliner in I'm
not really sure of color but it's black
and just a thin brush from Sigma and I'm
just gonna make a line on my upper lash
line and you can make this thicker if
you want I kind of went thin because I
want this look to be a little bit more
wearable than what she had so I'm making
a cut then
so now I'm going to grab a black
eyeliner for Mac and I'm just going to
line my upper waterline you don't
necessarily have to do this because I
know it's kind of tricky for some people
so this was just kind of like an extra
thing so now for the lashes in her look
her lashes were huge she obviously had
big lashes and I don't have any at the
moment I'm trying to make this more
wearable so I'm just gonna go right to
the eyelash curlers and just go to
mascara and I'm using Maybelline's all
things mascara and of course since I'm
not using any false eyelashes make sure
to pack on a lot of mascara so now grab
a bright blush and just fight normally
where you would normally put your blush
Nicki Minaj's face is flawless so I'm
going to take a highlight and just
highlight on my upper cheekbones and
just kind of blend that out with my
finger I ended up putting a lot on so
I'm sorry about that also I'm gonna
apply some to the bridge of my nose and
I don't know why I hit a red dot right
there you can't really see the camera
okay so now I'm gonna take a lip pencil
and create the little dots that she had
on her cheeks
and that's it for the face so now it's
time for the lips so I'm just going to
start out by putting on some lip balm
and a lot of people start out their lips
with using foundation but I'm going to
be using concealer for this tutorial and
I'm using a camera quad from Coastal
Scents and I'm actually going to be
using a purple concealer so using a lip
brush I'm just going to start patting on
that concealer all over my lips and it
looks really funny but don't worry it
won't look like that at the end so now
I'm going to take Coastal Scents smacks
lip gloss and this is in flippin hot
it's a super bright color and I'm just
going to cover my lips with all of it
and you can see that it obviously
changed my lips a lot more and now I'm
going to take a a little bit foundation
and a finishing brush and just kind of
clean up the edges on my lips and that's
it
so I hope you guys enjoyed today's
tutorial I've tried to make it as
wearable as possible and comes below
like it alright bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
