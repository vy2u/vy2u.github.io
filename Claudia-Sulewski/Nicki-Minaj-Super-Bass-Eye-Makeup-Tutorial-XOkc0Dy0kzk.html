you my little tutorial on how to
recreate the look that Nicki Minaj wore
in her super bass music video what is
for the boy to the boomin system
cocktail 18 with the cooling system when
you come up in a club baby blades enough
got sexo index like ebay but nothing any
ale he bailed keep my dad at they'll be
back by tells me okay so first I'm going
to start out with Urban Decay's i shadow
primer potion and I'm just going to
apply this all over my lid then I'm
going to be taking this is jumbo eye
shadow pencil in milk and I'm just going
to apply this over the lid and make sure
you pack on a lot because this will
definitely break up a yellow eyeshadow
and of course don't forget to blend it
out anyway Brittany so now I'm going to
grab a coastal scents I show palette and
choose brightest yellow that I could
find and just Pat that all over your lid
a bunch of times until the yellows break
it up now you want to bring the color
into your crease but don't bring it out
too high just a little bit about the
creeps you're the queen Ricky Lake I
noticed that you make sure you edit into
your inner corner as well next level
baby
this is the remix so now just grab any
dark brown eyeshadow or even just a
bronzer like what I'm doing and just
choose a big like fluffy brush and just
apply that right above the yellow this
will kind of deepen up your eyes and
also it will kind of give more cleaner
cut to the yellow DJ what do what so now
it's time to work on a lower lash line
I'm just going to grab over 2 k's i
shadow primer potion and apply that
underneath and of course you want to
blend it out with your finger so i'm
going to go back to the Coastal Scents
palette and choose the light baby pink
at the top make sure to tap off any
excess and just apply that on your lower
lash line I'm also going to dab I shout
out on my waterline just make sure you
don't get in your eye a great way to
pull down your waterline is just by
pressing your finger underneath it won't
be tugging on your eyes as much ok so
now turn for the eyeliner I'm just going
to grab went wild gel eyeliner in I'm
not only sugar color but it's black and
just a thin brush from sigma and i'm
just gonna make a line on my upper lash
line and you can make this thicker if
you want i kind of went thin because i
want this look to be a little bit more
wearable than what she had so i'm making
a cut then DJ still exclusive
so now I'm going to grab black eyeliner
from Mac and I'm just going to line my
upper waterline you don't necessarily
have to do this because I know it's kind
of tricky for some people so this was
just kind of like an extra thing so now
for the lashes in her look her lashes
were huge she obviously had big lashes
and I don't have any at the moment I'm
trying to make this more wearable so I'm
just gonna go right to the eyelash
curlers and just go to mascara and I'm
using Maybelline's all seasons hira and
of course since I'm not using any false
eyelashes make sure to pack on a lot of
mascara so now grab a bright blush and
just applied normally where you would
normally put your blush Nicki Minaj's
face is flawless so I'm going to take a
highlight and just highlight on my upper
cheek bones and just kind of blend that
out with my finger I ended up putting a
lot on so I'm sorry about that also i'm
going to apply some to the bridge of my
nose and I don't know why i had a red
dot right there you couldn't see the
camera ok so now i'm going to take a
little and create the little dots that
she had on her cheeks
and that's it for the face so now it's
time for the lips so I'm just going to
start out by putting on some lip balm
and a lot of people start out their lips
with using foundation but I'm going to
be using concealer for this tutorial and
I'm using a camera quad from coastal
scents and I'm actually going to be
using a purple concealer so using a lip
brush I'm just going to start patting on
that concealer all over my lips and it
looks really funny but don't worry it
won't look like that at the end so now
I'm going to take Coastal Scents smacks
lip gloss and this is in flippin hot
it's a super bright color and I'm just
going to cover my lips with all of it
and you can see that obviously changed
my lips a lot more and now I'm going to
take a foundation a little bit
foundation in a nation brush and just
kind of clean up the edges of my lips
and basically that's it so I hope you
guys enjoyed today's tutorial I've tried
to make it as wearable as possible and
come flow like it all right bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
