I can say

he's always fun
hi everybody so I know this wasn't your
typical nighttime routine video but I
really wanted to portray the fact that I
don't have a routine
in a more creative and cinematic way so
throughout the video I was doing
different things wearing different
outfits different emotions getting ready
but also getting unready at the same
time and I've just had a lot of fun with
this video I'm personally so so proud of
it so I really hope that you guys
enjoyed it so if you guys want me to
create more types of videos like these
where they're a little more out of the
box and just kind of higher quality and
then let me know by giving this video a
big thumbs up and subscribe to my
channel if you haven't already
also I quickly want to give a little
shout out and thank you to Corby for
letting me use their music because it
was the perfect fit it set the mood and
the vibe that I was searching for and it
fit perfectly and I've just been
obsessed with their music lately so I'm
all about finding new bands and types of
music to listen to so I thought I would
just give them a quick shout out so if
you guys want to check out their music
they recently came out the new single so
good yeah I will see you guys for a new
video very soon and I hope you guys have
a great weekend yeah goodbye
these suckers right here are magical
these liquid lipsticks are from Geoffrey
star and I think this is his only
product out right now I'm not quite sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
