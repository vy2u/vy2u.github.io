brilliant sighing - and I just did the
not my arms makeup challenge on her
channel as you can see I did a beautiful
job
so today Espen is going to do my makeup
all right so we've got this double
extra-large shirt from Target perfect
good looks good so I'm gonna grab my
basket of makeup which is right here
first I'm going to grab my foundation
and I want to start out by applying that
on my face so I'm just gonna pump some
on the back of my hand and just start
applying it to my face and my lips I
guess sometimes we just go over the edit
now I'm just gonna blend it out with my
fingers
make sure
perfect so now I'm going to go in with
my face powder and just start dusting
that on my face well perfect okay next
up I'm gonna grab I'm going to contour
my face a little bit first I'm gonna fix
these big hairs right here just kind of
push them back a little bit there you go
we're going to be using the bronzer
right here so once I figure out how to
open it there you go I'm gonna choose
the bronzer right there and choosing my
contour brush my other contour brush I'm
just gonna I'm gonna contour my cheeks
to really get that fine yeah who needs
blending right you just gonna put it up
to my neck because you don't the more
the better right so that is it for too
much I'm going to I'm going to be doing
a very dark smoky eye because I feel
like just having a really you know nice
dark lipstick so I'm actually gonna grab
mink and apply that all over my lid and
this is just a dark chocolate brown oh
it's okay if you get it on your lower
lash line or your eyebrow it's okay
once you tap off the excess and very
lightly apply this into my crease that
is definitely not my crease
sometimes if you like to go a little bit
on the bone onto my nose
I'm going to do the same thing to the
other eye okay after that we actually
we're gonna we're gonna highlight my
eyes
I'm gonna grab just a smaller brush but
that one works I'm just gonna apply this
on my brow bone or my eyebrow we do the
same thing it's really the same thing
got it it's all good and I'm just going
to create a fairly dramatic
well cuts my eye
and wing it out I'm pretty sure I did
this on my lower lash line I'm having
difficulties figure out which way I want
to do this I'm also gonna fill in my
eyebrow a little I guess and bring it
out chuckles why not okay
go big or go home wait what is I'm just
start stroking it onto my golly perfect
so I've got them a scare down so I'm
just going to apply this
our bodies are currently like sticking
together I pets it for the lipgloss and
that is actually it for today's tutorial
