my November favorites and before I start
getting into today's video I quickly
wanted to announce that I'm going to be
doing a blog miss this year so I'm
vlogging and uploading every single day
until christmas this month on my second
channel which is beyond baby star TVs so
I've already uploaded in my vlogmas day
one video because I'm filming this on
dis number second so I will make sure to
link that video in the downbar and I'll
also link my second channel so other
than that I'm just gonna get right into
today's videos so my first favorite for
the month of November was definitely my
feeble a juicy noir perfume and I'm
pretty sure this is their newest one
maybe not I don't know I smelled a
little sample of it in a magazine one
time and I automatically fell in love
with it it definitely reminds me a lot
of the original people of juicy perfume
but it definitely has more of like a
dark and spicy touch to it I don't know
I feel like I'm kind of saying this just
because it has the word nor in it but it
seriously smells like that it just has
like I need more like spicy and dark
touch to it I just repeated myself but
I've been wearing this every single day
since I got it and I also really like
the packaging of it I think the black
ribbon is so cute and yeah i definitely
recommend you guys checking out this
perfume my next favorite what of course
have to be at the naked 3 palette this
one is kind of new so i recently got it
but i had to mention it in today's video
i recently uploaded a review / demo on
this product shown you guys all the
different colors and i also included
like a little tutorial in there so i'll
be sure to leave that video linked in
the downbar if you guys want to hear me
go and fold depth about it but it
basically looks like this it's very
pretty it's all like pinks and purple
colors which i think is so perfect for
the winter and holiday time perfect for
parties or just going out or whatever
but you can definitely create barry at
neutral every day I makeup looks with
this so it's definitely my most favorite
palette out of the three and I've just
been loving it so had to include that my
next favorite is the eyeliner that I've
been using and this is
the Knicks super fat I marker so as you
guys can tell the marker is just very
big and fat so it makes it very very
easy to create very dramatic and big
winged eyeliner looks because all my
other eye liners are very thin and small
and it's kind of hard to like you know
get it even looking and pretty so I just
find that it's very easy to use this
marker and I have been using this every
day I could say yes every single day my
next favorite is a Revlon lip gloss and
it's actually funny because I
rediscovered this product in my makeup
collection and now when I think back on
how many times I've used this when I
first got it last year I literally think
I wore this maybe once or twice it is
the Revlon Colorstay lip gloss in the
shade decadent which I'm pretty sure
this is from the holiday collection of
last year so I don't know if you can
still buy this but it's basically just a
very dark and bright purple with little
reflexes of a blue and pink inside of it
so it's very very shiny and pretty and I
love it so much it's just funny to think
about because last year I was not into
dark lips at all are not as much as I am
this year um so I don't even know why I
bought this because I wore at one time
but I'm happy that I did because I
recently pulled it out and was like hey
you know what this might look you with
hmm maybe the mac cyber lipstick I'm
sure most of you know how much I have
been obsessed with my mac cyber lipstick
I wear it all the time I wear it at home
my parents probably think I'm a freak
this lipstick looks so good with this
lip gloss because the lipstick gives
that dark color to your lip and then the
lip gloss on top just gives this really
nice like blue pinky purple just shine
to your lips and it looks so unique and
different and cool and I've never seen
anyone's lips look like this before I
don't know it just looks very cool to me
so that has just been really fun to play
around with so I'm very happy that i
bought this last year my next favorite
is also in lip product and it is the
Maybelline Baby Lips a doctor rescue and
the
just in the sent to cool which is just
clear but I've been using this every
single day and before this 1i only owned
one other Baby Lips chapstick and it was
like a bright pink one so I never really
wore it so I'm still pretty much a noob
with these but I really really like it
and I see what all the hype is about so
I'm happy that I got this plus be sent
kind of reminds me of like christmas and
winter because it has like this I see
like wintry minty smell to it so i also
like it for that reason next up i wanted
to mention what facial cleanser I've
been using lately and this is the
benefit cleanse foaming wait clean
facial wash and first can we just start
off with the packaging it is so so so
cute the color is adorable the cap is
like fake cork which looks so cute and
they have a whole line of these products
I really want to try out the under eye
cream because I've heard a lot of things
about that I also tried their makeup
remover which I also really like but
I've been really liking their face wash
because lately my skin has really
started to clear up so I've kind of
stopped using my usual face products
that are made more towards like fighting
acne and breakouts and pimples and stuff
and this face wash focuses more on
cleaning off the dirt and makeup and
sweat off your face I'd also leathers up
very well and it has a very fresh and
clean a scent to it which is also very
nice so I've been using this every
single day every morning and night for
the past like month ish my next favorite
is a candle from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works and I
cannot believe I'm saying this but this
candle has actually beats the
marshmallow fireside candle what you
guys know I am obsessed with I talk
about it all the time and it smells so
so good but this candle that I'm about
to show you has won my heart yes it's
not so good it is the red velvet cupcake
candle oh my god if you guys don't know
this my favorite dessert flavor anything
is by far red velvet and this candle
smells exactly like it I just oh my god
it just it smells like red velvet and
then it has
that hint of like the cream cheese
frosting and when you light it it smells
even better it smells like you're baking
like red velvet cake or cupcakes when i
first recommended the marshmallow
fireside kale two guys that was more of
like I yeah like if you have the store
definitely check it out you know this
candle you need to go turn off your
computer and you need to go to store and
you need to buy it right now because it
smells amazing I can't get over it I
need to buy more before they stop
selling their holiday candles and I just
need to stock up in like 10 my next
favorite is my new vlogging camera which
is the canon powershot elph 110 HS and
it's just the black one I'm pretty sure
this is like the most used and popular
camera for all the bloggers out on
youtube because i feel like people
always talk about this one I always see
people buying it and using it and stuff
so I decided to buy it because i really
love Canon it's definitely my favorite
camera company and so far I've been
loving it i love how sleek it looks it's
small compact and it just has amazing
qualities so I've been really liking
this for vlog miss of course my next
favorite is the perfect fit by tone it
up protein powder and I've been buying
their vanilla one for a while now pretty
much since it came out because I started
buying it right when I found out about
it but they have recently come out with
the chocolate flavor which I have been
waiting for so so so so long and I can
definitely say that the chocolate one is
a lot better I normally use their
protein powders to put into my smoothies
mixed with water it also make their
famous protein pancakes but recently
I've kind of come up with my own protein
bar recipe which I definitely will do a
video on soon but it includes their
chocolate protein because it tastes oh
my god so I definitely definitely
recommend this if any of you guys are
into working out and are into protein
powders and stuff like that five stars
very good love it my last favorite for
the month of November is the app called
spin me and it's basically
just an alarm clock app but it forces
you to stand up put your thumbs on the
screen so you don't cheat and spin in a
circle twice to turn off the alarm clock
I have a lot of troubles waking up in
the morning especially very early so
this app was like the greatest thing
that I have ever downloaded so I
definitely definitely recommend it like
I just I can't wake up in the morning
without it now I'm obsessed of it so
that is it for my November favorites I
hope you guys enjoyed it be sure to

will be linked down there so that you
