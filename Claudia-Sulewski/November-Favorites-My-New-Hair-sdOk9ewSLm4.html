doing my November favorites and the last
time I recorded a favorites video was
all the way in August so it has been a
very long time and if you go watch it I
was so tan in that video looking at me
now I look like a vampire so it's just
it's really depressing but if you guys
want to see that video i will link it
down I don't know just in case if you
want to see it so as always I'm going to
start out with some beauty products my
first favorites are the Revlon lip
butters and it took me such a long time
to try these out I don't know why but I
only have three colors at the moment I
have gum drop which looks like this and
I love these so much they're so smooth
this one's literally like a light purple
it's so pretty so let me watch it for
you guys there it is against my really
white hand I seriously I'm considering
putting on like tanning lotion on
tonight because I just so white right
now the next one is lollipop and this
one is gorgeous it's like a bright pink
raspberry color um my lighting is
actually kind of washing out right now
so that color is a lot more darker than
it appears on camera but then the last
one is strawberry shortcake and this one
is a light pink color this one's great
for everyday so there it is at the top I
just dropped it yeah i love these lip
butters they are very very moisturizing
and i love the color payoff oh I totally
forgot to mention but um probably my
number one favorite this month is my new
hair um so I colored and cut my hair
like two weeks ago or something I don't
really know but fog on Instagram or
Twitter then you would already know um
but yes I did do it at home so my hair
used to be like down to here it was a
very dramatic v-cut but i recently
wanted to make it more like flat as you
can see and it used to be like down here
so obviously I cut off a lot well yeah
and I also did a couple of lighter
highlights on
bottom so it's obviously a lot lighter
in the bottom and I love it so much so
yeah this is like my number one favorite
of the month my hair my next favorite is
a mac lipstick and I talked about this
one on my channel many times but i ended
up losing it like a month after i
purchased it which is really sad and
this is the wrong one okay well I'm
obviously very prepared for today's
video it's right guys I found in my
backpack this is the mac lipstick in hue
and it's a very pretty light pinky nude
lipstick and I was in love with this
until I lost it and I finally
repurchased it so I've been loving that
this month next up I've got two hair
products the first one is the Baptiste
dry shampoo and this is my first dry
shampoo in a spray form and I like it so
much more than like the powder form
because I have the lush one as well and
I got the one for dark brown for deep
brown hair color because obviously my
hair is a lot darker on the top and
that's the only place where I spray it
but I love this stuff all I do is just
like part my hair on the side here spray
it shake it out kind of like massage it
into my roots and I'll do it on this
side and then a little on the back and
it is wonderful then my next favorite is
the it's a tense spray and this stuff is
so good I don't know why it's taking me
so long to purchase it but yeah it
repairs damaged hair and its shine it
detangles the controls frizz there's
just a bunch of things that it does on
the back but i mainly use this for
detangling my hair um protecting it from
heat and just having it shiny looking so
this is very nice and it smells good so
that's always good my next favorite is
the body wash that i've been using when
this is the clean and clear body boost
mango and papaya morning burst body wash
and it's orange I got this in October
but I didn't end up doing in October
favorites so this has been like my
favorite since October and I really like
stuff because it smells so good it just
smells really fresh and clean and clean
and clear never disappoints me when it
comes to having their products smell
very fresh and clean so this is great
for the morning it's great for pretty
much any time during the day it just it
smells so good and obviously I've used a
lot of that my next favorite is more on
the fashion side it's like an accessory
and it is this little purse right here
so cute so this little crossbody bag is
from chic Nova I will link it down below
if you guys would like to purchase this
but yeah so it looks like this material
is kind of like woven crisscross and it
just has a little flap and it has silver
hardware and it's just it's very simple
and I love this because it's great if
you're just going to the grocery store
and all you need is like your debit card
um like some chapstick and like your
phone or something so this is great this
fits pretty much any essential that you
need and it's great for on the go so
i'll have that linked down below my next
favorite is somewhat weird but it is a
toothbrush and this is the oral-b 3d
white something-something toothbrush I
don't know so i went to walgreens and i
want to buy a new one because mine was
just getting really like phrase at the
tips and it was just it was old so i got
this one and i thought you know what
I've ever like it's cute and stuff
didn't realize until I open the package
that's actually a mechanical toothbrush
so it looks like a normal one but it's
actually mechanical one so it has an on
and off button right there sorry my
nails are so gross I'll just just try to
ignore my nails but um can hear that
yeah so it vibrates it says that this
will last until it's ready to be thrown
out so you don't have to like add in any
batteries or anything and it's just it's
ready to go so I love this so much I've
been using it for a couple weeks now and
I just it's a great toothbrush my next
favorite are the forever 21 workout
leggings capri leggings I've been
wearing these for
long time but recently I just kind of
went insane and bought a bunch of them
but i love these for yoga these are like
my favorite types of bottom to where
they're like leggings but they don't go
all the way to the bottom they just go
halfway so i have a bunch of different
colors some reason all the ones i
grabbed are like gray but no so these
are black and they just have blue on
them and I have these gray ones that
have like a magenta color on them with
stripes down the side these are like the
same kind except they're neon orange I
love these and then these have little
pink zigzags on the side so I've been
loving those they're very comfortable
and they're perfect for yoga my next
favorite are my scissors and these are
scissors specially made to cut hair
because one blade is normal and one kind
of looks like a comb but it's very sharp
and okay I don't advise you guys to cut
your hair at home because obviously it's
so easy to screw up and make your hair
look very bad but I've honestly I've
done so much to my hair that at this
point like I can trust myself with what
I do because I just I've been messing
with my hair for like years now so I
love this if any of you guys do want to
cut your hair at home make sure you ask
your parents um then definitely get
these kind of scissors you can get them
anywhere I don't even know what brand
these are but my mom got it for me and
they're rainbow and they're very cute
but what they do is when you cut your
hair on because of this blade right here
it makes it like kind of rigid and not
like perfectly straight because um I
don't know just my opinion out I don't
really like perfectly straight hair i
think it just looks too like perfect if
you know what I'm saying so this is
great because you can just cut it and it
makes your ends look more you know
natural looking i guess i don't know but
um really like this I constantly find
myself touching up on my hair I've just
been going shorter and shorter like
every week but I just I'm really into
short hair right now and I think I might
want a little bit shorter I'm not sure
so then my next favorite is my phone
case i recently bought a new one and
this is the bird's nest phone case i
think it's called you can get these
honestly anywhere
ebay amazon i think i got mine from
overstock for like five dollars three
dollars i don't even know but it was so
cheap and i just got it in black and has
a matte finish so i really like how it
looks against my shiny phone and it's
just simple like that but it has cuts on
the sides and it's really cool I think
it I think it just looks really edgy
getting all that stuff so yeah so my
last three favorites are food favorites
and the first ones I've just I've been
obsessed with guys I'm so excited to
show you it so they are the noodles no
oodles I guess that's how you would say
it and these are zero calorie noodles
yes you heard that right these have
absolutely like no fat no sodium no
cholesterol no protein no sugars no
calories literally nothing it's like as
if you're eating water so there's a
nutrition thing but yeah I've basically
been replacing these with my regular
noodles lately and um when you buy them
they're already like mushy and in the
form of noodles so all you have to do is
just rinse it out with water and then
you can heat them up through on your
favorite sauce and stuff and it's just
it's great so if you guys are wondering
what they are made of they are made of
water at yam flour and lime so um I've
just really been liking these maybe I'll
do a recipe video using these like my
favorite like stir fry or something at
home and then I could like include these
and stuff like that so um yeah they
don't taste like anything they taste
just like regular noodles and they're
great you can find them on the shelves
of the all-natural like organic aisle so
yeah it was kind of hard finding them
but that's where they are my next
favorite are the booty no gluten free
press and twists after chinese i will
literally never go back to normal
pretzels these taste so good so they are
gluten and wheat free their milk free
casting free and egg fries so these were
also in the organic aisle
and they are the best pretzels in the
world's guys I'm not even kidding like
you guys need to try them so they just
look like normal pretzels and when you
bite into them they're just so like airy
and crunchy and I just you have to try
them to understand what I'm trying to
say I can't even explain it you just
need you to buy them you really do and
then my last favorite is just a box in
empty box because you know I already ate
them all but I also got these in the
organic aisle and these are the enjoy
life oven-baked coco loco chewy bars and
that's how they look so yeah and each
bar is 110 calories and it only has five
grams of sugar and sixty five milligrams
of sodium so yeah they're pretty healthy
and oh and they're gluten free which is
great so story behind these I originally
bought these thinking that they would
taste you know like chocolate like
really sweet bars um but they they don't
taste they don't taste like chocolate
it's weird um the first time I try these
I was I cut I didn't like it the first
time I tried it like it has like you can
taste the cocoa in it but it just has
this like bitter kind of chocolate taste
it's definitely not sweet it's more like
bitter but um yeah so I take my first
bite I'm like you know like I feel like
I'm eating like bitter cardboard right
now but for some reason I kept on eating
it like I didn't want to put it down and
I have become obsessed with these I
don't know why they taste so good to me
they're like they just are not sweet
they're not like chocolate or anything
but they taste so good I I enjoyed
eating so much like I get excited when i
get to eat them and when i get to buy
them so i don't know it's kind of weird
so I'm warn you guys so don't think that
it like this very sweet and chocolatey
they're more like
Coco but they are so good I just I don't
know it's weird okay but you guys should
try these as well um half you guys
probably won't like them but I love them
so much so there's everything that I've
been liking for the past month I hope
you guys enjoyed today's video and yeah
I will talk to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
