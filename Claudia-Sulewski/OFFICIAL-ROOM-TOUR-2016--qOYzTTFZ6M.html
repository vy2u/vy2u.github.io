crib clerk singular welcome to my room

you guys have not these seasons before
but let's just give them a little
overview when you first walk in this is
actually a new addition I added this
this week but it's a little metal to do
list board type thing you can do these
things if you want shadow if you guys
know what that's from it's from a vlog
and then here we have this little
machine that I've actually never used
before but it makes me feel important I
feel like I have some sort of privilege
of this having this in my room but like
literally there's no purpose to it I
don't use it this is the hey there table
because basically every time you walk in
it's like set the lip gloss down hey
there
walk into the room the mirror hey hey
there so this mirror is from Target as
the little table is from cd2
the bookends are from Z Gallerie down
here we've got a nice little boss from
cv2 and here's little Russell he's from
TJ Maxx or some sort he's so cute cutey
probably my favorite part about this
room right now is at
the ceiling if you guys want to check
that out we're trying to give this room
kind of a more industrial raw vibe
actually if you guys want to come check
out the little construction site we have
going on in the hallway yeah
I'm guilty moving on with this side of
the room over here we have my little
branch tree from Restoration Hardware
then over here we have this really cool
little mirror vase and I got this from Z
Gallerie this piece right here is
actually from Ikea I had in my old room
and basically I just customized where I
wanted the cabinets and drawers and
stuff so these two little paintings are
from Etsy gallery and they're really
cool because they're also framed with
this leg black lighting which makes it
look really nice there's lots of white
marble in my room and we've got lots of
colorful sharpies never have I ever used
those sharpies but you know they're
there in case I need them um and then on
top we've got a little record player
when you go down here we've got another
dogs terribly I forgot his name
so what Sam he does have a name
someone's gonna comment Stanley I feel
like it almost was Stanley but his name
will be standing okay great I like
Stanley cameras jars in here we don't
have to like fully go in-depth here we
have my books vinyls these we just have
random little like electronics and stuff
nothing too exciting um it just more
chords basically all the YouTube things
then over here we have my little
workstation so obviously we have my
desktop computer so this desk is from
pbteen actually and I really like the
like metal legs on it I think it looks
really cool I'm currently in the market
for a more comfortable desk chair but
this one is doing the job for now it's
from Ikea over here you've got this
little mirror like little tray thing of
some Polaroids
once again more holiday decor really
just don't want to get rid of it because
it's so cute but there's like a little
and then we just have pens pencils fake
flowers because I can't keep real
flowers alive and that was me being sick
I'm not sniffling so here we have the
trash can of my bedroom completely
useless tiny you can't fit anything in
there but it looks so cute it's my
marble and it's from Bed Bath and Beyond
here is another new addition to the
family this is very important especially
if you're living in a house in LA where
people will go through your garbage it's
sketchy but it's important to get this
it's a paper shredder so if you have any
important papers that you want to throw
out shred it first guys over here is my
balcony and nothing too exciting we have
like a little table and egg chair then
moving on to this corner on my room
we've got this little collage of a bunch
of photos I printed off of my Instagram
here is my nightstand it is from mod
shop and I absolutely love the style of
this nightstand we've got this really
awesome like white painted wood and
inside we just have random notebooks a
little candle lighter and then of course
the holiday decor we still have my admin
calendar from Target this lamp is from
targets here we have a little tray of
silver things that I'm collecting from
every country that I visit not really a
collection yet but we've got this little
like trinket from London and you
basically just slide it over your
glasses or papers to help you read
closer so I thought that was really cute
and then from the Bahamas I have a
little silver sand dollar next up we
have my oh I have yet to buy a bigger
mattress actually I bought it last night
so I'm waiting so this is my bed it's
from West Elm my white sheets are from
Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond this black fuzzy
pillow is from Z Gallerie the rest are
from Target now of jumping over to the
Ottoman this

out to look nothing like I thought I
would because I got online but it's all
good
you know it's great it matches then on
this side of my room we've got the chair
where you can either sit and ponder
about life or or sit this chair is from
West Elm and this pillow is from I think
three people no no Aeropostale no and
apology that's it cute little candle
