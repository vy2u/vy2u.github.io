an outfit of the day and I'm not gonna
lie I am definitely a walking
advertisement for forever 21 right now
but I mainly do these videos to kind of
show you guys how I like to piece
together different clothing items more
than just showing you who where and get
my stuff so I don't really care but I'm
just saying like I'm wearing a lot of
forever21 today so first I'm just gonna
start out with Julie and accessories so
I did not mean to do this but all of my
bracelets are from jewel mint the first
two you guys have already seen before
this first one which is like gold this
was called the Amerikan dome bracelet I
think it's called and then the one next
to that is like silver and this is
called the Windsor bracelet and then
these three I recently got which I have
been obsessed with and they are called
the Athena bracelets so if you want to
read that here you go I love these
because of how different they are so
obviously you can see that they're all
different colors so this one is more
purple this one's more blue and this
one's kind of a yellowy golden color and
also I really like how they're
differently made like this one's kind of
twisted and this one's I don't even know
what you call that and this one's more
like diagonal and then also if you
notice here sorry the sunlight is really
annoying but um all the metals on these
bracelets are different this one is rose
gold this one's golden and then this
one's silver and they all have different
types of chains so this one has like
circular chains this one has like a long
one in the middle and then that one it
looks like that so I love how different
and unique these are I think they're
great for the summer because it's a
great kind of pop of color and I love
like friendship bracelets I think they
look so cute overall I just really like
how all these bracelets look together
and I will also have Gentleman its link
in the downbar just in case if you guys
want to check it out and you never have
so that will be down there so now let's
get on to my full outfit as you can see
it's very simple but I really like
for some reason so for my shirt I'm just
wearing this white v-neck from forever21
of course and then also I just nodded it
and kind of tied it in the front kind of
off to the side to give it more of a
kind of vintage feel I guess I don't
know
and then my shorts are of course also
from forever 21 they're light blue
really distressed high-waisted and I
love these shorts so much so for my back
it's just this crochet kind of tan
crossbody bag and it has a braided strap
and I kind of personalized it myself
because I originally didn't really like
how it looked so first off the fringes
actually were straight across and they
were really long they like went down to
here and I didn't really like it so I
cut them shorter and made them into a V
so that they kind of flowed with the
shape of the purse and then also the
strap was really long so right here I
just kind of folded the strap and then
took some of the leftover tassels that I
had and then just made a knot it looks
kind of awkward but whatever there's
really no other way to adjust the strap
because it's just braided so that's how
it looks too far away I love this purse
so much I'm so happy that I got it you
can check this out online it's probably
still mine for like $22 so then for my
shoes I'm wearing these golden
flip-flops that I got forever ago
they're from apostrophe I don't even
know what store that is but they used to
have like a golden flower in the middle
and I didn't really like it so I kind of
just ripped it off so now they're more
simple but I like these because they
match with my bracelets and it kind of
ties the whole outfit together oh I also
forgot to show you guys my earrings
they're just simple little pearls
they're from forever 21 just in case you
guys weren't like catching on you know
oh that is it for today's video I hope
you guys enjoyed it and that's it so
I'll talk to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
