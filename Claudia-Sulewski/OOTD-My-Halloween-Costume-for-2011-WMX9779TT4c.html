come sit on my videos and send me
messages asking me what I'm going to be
for Halloween this year and obviously
you can see that I'm an Indian I don't
know you can tell but yeah so today I
decided just to do a quick out for the
day it's kind of show you guys my
Halloween costume and I'm not gonna be
trick-or-treating this year so I'm
probably just gonna be passing out candy
on Monday to set my house but I am going
to a Halloween party today and tomorrow
so um yes so I just decided that I'm
gonna show you guys a Halloween costume
because I showed it last year and you
guys liked it when I show it to you so
yeah keep on watching to find out what I
was wearing
okay so first we're gonna start out with
the top half
so ask for makeup I'm wearing just a
really really neutral eye nothing really
special but I did create a you can see
my character ah you can see that I drew
a white line here with a light brown
line right there and then also like a
dark brown line I don't know I just do
the lines and of course I just have like
a new lip like I always do and then my
mom actually had a bunch of like random
feathers kind of like sewed on two
pieces of leather so I tied this one and
created like a little cross headband
it's as you can see and there's just a
ribbon title to that also I just took
earrings and I tied the leather to them
and then I just kind of the feather is
hanging down from dad sorry this is
really shaky but yet so you can see my
little feathers and then so I don't know
where she got those I'm sure you can get
feathers I like Michaels and then also I
have this kind of beaded choker necklace
and I think this was like from a flea
market or something my mom said she's
Ali's sure then I just have some
bracelets I've this wooden one from
Claire's and this leather one which I'm
not sure and then here tie and then as
you can see I'm wearing my hair
extensions to kind of make my hair look
longer I have it down the middle part
and is that for the top yeah okay so
this is my dress it's like a tight black
dress that has fringe going all the way
down the side so as you can see it
like fringe going all the way down the
side which is really cool and it goes
all the way to the bottom have you see
it like that yeah and then also I took a
little leather piece or whatever and
just kind of tied it to my upper waist
just to give a little bit more detail so
the person I'm using is my mom's purse
and it looks like this it just has a
bunch of fringe on it and stuff and this
is from cut and paste so it looks like
that and then the handle is really cool
it has like breathing on it and then my
nails are just like black I don't know
I don't I didn't really care about my
nails too much and then also I have
these little booties I mean that booties
but boots and I just had some feathers
on them and these are from Nordstrom I
think like a while back I guess these
are my mom's and I thought they fit well
the theme and then the dress was
actually from it's like a v-neck dress
too which is what I like but the dress
is from I think my mom said was like
from some like local boutique so I can't
really like tell you guys hurt by it but
yeah this is my halloween costume and I
hope you guys enjoyed today's video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
