my outfit of the day and also I'm going
to be featuring these boots right here
and these tribal boots are from
Schumann's I promised that I would be
showing you guys a quick off the day
showing how I would style these and one
of my outfits so that's what I have for
you today I will have their website
linked in the down bar this is the first
time I've ever gotten shoes from
Schumann's and I am in love with these I
love the sizing I'm a size 7 in them
because normally I'm like a size 7 so
they fit great they're really
comfortable and overall I think they are
very cute so I will link their website
in the Dom bar they look like this they
just have buckles here and then they
also have a zipper going down right here
so that you can unzip it when you're
putting the shoe on and overall these
are definitely one of my favorite pair
of boots that I own so now let's get
into the outfit of the day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
