a quick outfit of the night because
tonight I have a school dance and it's
called girls choice we're basically a
girl ask the guy instead of the guy and
the girl and I just want to show you
guys my quick outfit and stuff like that
so yeah first I'm gonna start out with
Julie and it's very very simple I don't
really know why but I just didn't really
want a lot so for my earrings I'm just
wearing my forever 21 Black Rose
earrings and then also I'm just wearing
this little bracelet from gentleman I
don't know why I love this so much but
I've got in my mouth um but yeah I don't
know why I love it so much I mean it's
so simple but I kind of like it that's
why so I will have jewel mints link in
the downbar if you want to check them
out and then for my hair I just curled
it with a flat iron which I made a video
on before and then also my makeup I just
have Mac hue lipstick on and I'm an eye
look that I used from The Naked palette
and I think I'm gonna do tutorial on it
cuz I love this like so much and then as
for my dress let me just back up so it
looks like this it's just a black tight
dress so I also realized that this dress
is kind of similar to my graduation
dress from 8th grade but that's okay
whatever I really like black dresses so
the front looks like this it's so pretty
it has this awesome like kind of folded
texture here and then here you could see
my hair more it also has kind of like
lines on it but you won't see it cuz
it's black but it just looks like this
and I got this dress from Macy's it was
like seventy dollars which is kind of
expensive but again kind of it's like
kind of in the middle I know it's really
simple but that's kind of how I like it
I like having kind of more simpler
dresses so I look back at my pictures
I'm not like oh god why did I wear
but yeah and then for my shoes of course
I'm just wearing my nude high heels from
Steve Madden they just look like that
I've got these in New York when I went
there for the first time and then also
for my purse I'm using this little
quilted little satchel thingy from
forever 21 and I guess it kind of meshes
of the heels it's not the exact color
but whatever and then oh also my nails
so they look like this and I don't know
what this like style is called I think
it's like Halfmoon or something but I'm
just wearing nude nail polish and little
black whatever you want to call them
half circles and yeah that is it for my
outfit um I will have a tutorial on this
look very soon and I'm gonna have so
much fun also after the dance we're
gonna have a party at my friend Neely's
house and it's a pink party so basically
you have to wear all pink
yeah that's why my toes are hot pink but
I'm not gonna show you guys my feet
because some people have some feet
fetishes here on YouTube so I hope you
guys enjoyed this quick video and I'll
talk to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
