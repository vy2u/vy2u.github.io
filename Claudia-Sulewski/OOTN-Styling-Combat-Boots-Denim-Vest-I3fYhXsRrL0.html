showing you guys my often of the nights
because I'm going out to dinner for my
friends birthday and I thought that my
outfit looked really interesting and
cute so yeah first I'm going to start
out by showing you guys the jewelry that
i'm wearing it's pretty simple but i
still like it so I'm wearing one
bracelet and you guys have seen this
before it's from jewel meant it's my
Windsor set bracelet so it came with the
earrings as well which I'm wearing right
now and I just like it because it's very
small and dainty and it matches with my
purse cuz my purse is silver and it has
a clear diamonds in the middle and then
my earrings I am wearing these they look
like this they like open up and like i
said before they came with the bracelet
i'm sure you guys all know what Joe mint
is so I will leave their website link in
the down bar and then also i'm wearing
an elephant piercing in my tragus whole
um long story but um to summarize it the
earring that they pierce do with is
really short and it always like comes
out so I have to use an earring that has
a really long like pointy stick to it so
that it sticks all the way through but
then probably once I leave out the dorm
and put the diamond back in but I don't
know it's a long story in it you guys
are probably confused but whatever so
just pretend that's the diamond right
there and then my hair is just naturally
straight didn't really do anything to it
I'm just wearing a middle part and then
for my makeup I am wearing I actually
have it in my Chris right now I am
wearing my favorite MAC lipstick which
is myth of course and then on top I'm
wearing the mac cremesheen glass in
Wright's image it's just a pale pink
color and then for my eye makeup I am
just wearing some gray eyeliner on the
top and bottom and this is from Kiko
cosmetics it looks like this and it's
very pretty because a swatch it's like a
charcoal gray shimmery color it's very
very pretty so then for my outfit I'm
wearing this black dress from forever 21
and it looks like
it's very simple it's just black and it
has this really nice kind of lace
detailing to it and then of course it
has the mesh at the top and also right
here in the middle so I think it's very
simple but so cute at the same time so
that I wanted to pair this dress with my
denim vest from pacsun just to give it a
little bit more of like an edgy vibe to
it and it kind of makes this dress look
a little bit more casual than on the
fancy side so this is what it looks like
with the vest and then for my shoes I'm
wearing these Steve Madden combat boots
which just have gold spikes on them but
I covered them with black nail polish to
make it look a little bit more subtle
and much more to my outfits oh I'm just
wearing these and then I undid the
lacing up here and then just tied it
around the boot like that
and then the purse that I'm using is
this little juicy couture clutch and
this actually used to be a little purse
but I decided to take off the little
handle because it was really short and
awkward looking so now I just use it as
a little clutch and it matches with my
jewelmint jewelry so that is why I'm
wearing it it keeps everything that i
need so i really like it and it gives us
look a little bit more of a girly feel
because i don't want to lose that girly
feel to it so that is it for my outfit i
hope you guys enjoyed it and stay tuned
for another video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
