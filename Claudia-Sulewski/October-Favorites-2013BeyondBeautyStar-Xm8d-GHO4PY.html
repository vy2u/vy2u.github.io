hey guys so today I'm going to be doing
on my October favorites video and I'm a
little bit late this month but I was
really excited to show you guys the
different products and stuff that I've
been loving so I'm just going to get
started with my favorite beauty products
of the month the first one is a new
foundation that I've been using and it
is the Neutrogena skin clearing oil free
makeup and the two that i was using
before this which are the maybelline
stick foundation and the benefit hello
flawless are a little bit too dark for
me right now so i decided to try out a
different foundation i've been using
this one lately and i'm in the shade 30
buff and i really really like it a lot
um I don't know if it's really clearing
out my skin my acne is definitely
getting better just because I haven't
been as stressed out lately but I really
do like it and I think it gives really
great coverage and stuff so I've been
really liking this foundation during the
month of October next up I've got four
different lipsticks that I've been
loving and you guys have probably
noticed that this season I've really
been going crazy with the lip colors so
I've got four to show you guys in
today's video so first off I've got the
mac lipstick I've just been obsessed
with mac lipsticks recently but the
first one I have is in the shade up the
amp which is what I'm wearing on my lips
right now and it's like a dark plummy
purple pink in color I don't know how to
explain it I've just really been into
purple lips lately I don't know why I
think it looks really cool and it's
perfect for the full time so yeah this
is like a light purple lipstick and I
loved it so much I think it's such a fun
color and actually like the finish of it
so that is my first favorite lipstick of
the month the next mode which is also
from that this is in the shade cyber
which is crazy this is probably my
number one like most favorite lipstick
of the month I've been wearing it out
all the time and as you can see it looks
very very dark almost black but it's
more of like a dark kind of cooler tone
purple and it honestly it looks so
pretty on a bit instagramming and taking
photos and tweeting with this lipstick
on a bunch of times and a lot of you
guys asked me what lipstick I'm wearing
so this is the one and I just love it so
much so I think it's really great for
this time of year as well and my next
two are from a rebel
so this one I wanted to show you guys
this lipstick because it's a great dupe
for the one that I'm wearing my lips
right now this isn't a shade very hot
and I mean it basically is like the same
color so i just want to show it to you
guys because it's obviously you know a
cheaper alternative to the mac one but i
really do like both so i wanted to talk
about that one real quick and the last
one that i have is the revlon a lustrous
lipstick and this is in the shade siren
which is such a fun color since i've
been experimenting with very bold lips
recently I want to try out the whole
orange lip on me and see if it looks
good and I really like this color so
siren is a very pretty just hot almost
read more like orange lipstick and I
think it's so fun so now I've just got a
few nail related favorites for the month
of October and the first one is a nail
stickers I have been wearing every
single time I like change up my nails I
always wear nail stickers now I think
they're so fun and they just spice up
any nail look and they're so so easy to
apply on so I've got a bunch to show you
guys I'm actually wearing some right now
so first off I've been really liking it
the SE nail stickers I've got two of
these so I've got these it kind of
looked like little circles but their
silver and they're really pretty so I've
got those on my nails right now with
just some white nail polish my next
favorites are these gold ones from SE
and they kind of remind me of beehives
because they're like little hexagons but
these look really cool against black
nails i recently instagram myself
wearing these so i'll post a photo
somewhere on the screen but yeah these
are really fun i also have these I have
no idea where I got these i got them a
long long time ago but these are also
really pretty they just have a bunch of
funky designs with some gold and silver
jewels so that one's really fun the next
one i have is by the brand nail rock and
are just these cheetah printed stickers
which i have not used yet but i think
they're so cute and I can't wait to use
these and the last ones i have are the
sally hansen salon effects stickers and
i have not used this one yet either but
i just want to show you guys because i'm
so excited please fade from gold to
purple and then back to gold so I'm
really excited to use the
is I think they're perfect for the fall
time with the color scheme and I think
they're just going to look so cool like
black matte nails or something so I've
just been going absolutely insane with
nail stickers and I always get questions
on how I do my nails on Instagram and
real life and that's all it is just nail
stickers I'm obsessed my last snail
related favorite is a nail polish from
SC and this is in the shade it's so set
and I really like this color because
it's like a muted kind of army green all
of the color and I don't know I think
it's really fun it's great for this time
of year so I just wanted to show this
nail polish to you guys my next favorite
is a body wash that I've been using and
this is the bath and Bodyworks warm
vanilla sugar Shea in vitamin E shower
gel this stuff smells amazing and I just
get so excited when I take showers now
because it smells so good and it
basically just smells like warm vanilla
and sugar I don't really know how else
to describe it but yeah this stuff
smells so good I love Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
shower gels I love all the sense they
have so it's also helping me get into
the whole holiday mood and stuff because
it just reminds me of like Christmas so
I've been really liking this shower gel
my next to favorites are also from Bath
&amp;amp; Body Works and they are two candles
and I really like these little mason jar
candles that they've been slowing I
think they look so much cuter than you
know the original ones if they sell and
I don't know I just think they look
really cool so first off I have been
completely obsessed with marshmallow
fireside I cannot this is probably my
number one favorite candle from them
right now like this candle top sleeves
that is how much I love it so I
basically smells to me it smells like
Cologne mixed in with marshmallow and
that might sound kind of weird but it
smells so good oh my gosh and when you
light it it smells even better it's just
I don't even know how to explain it
imagine roasting hot marshmallows with
an Abercrombie model right next to you
like that's that's basically what this
smells so yeah I've been loving this
candle and it's my other favorite is the
candle in blackberry spice and this one
smells like a mix of cinnamon you can
definitely smell the cinnamon and Barry
is so it's got like a little it's got
like a fruity punch to it but it mainly
smells like spicy cinnamon yeah they
also really like the color of this one
as well now I've just got a few fashion
related favorites for you guys the first
ones are these booties right here I have
been wearing these like crazy and I love
them I've been getting a bunch of
compliments on these on my videos and in
real life and these are from forever 21
which really just surprises me because
they just look so fancy like duties not
look like designer shoes I don't know
they were be out of proof like my mom
was like oh my god Claudia where did you
get those basically I know that I did
something good at the other proofs of it
so they look like this they're kind of
like a shiny faux leather boot and it's
cool because it has this little like
strap here I guess you could say but
it's held by these little black strings
so it just looks really cool it's got
like a slit right here and I think they
look so cool my next favorite is also
from forever 21 and they've just really
been impressing me lately I'm finding so
many good things there I went through a
phase where I didn't like it anymore but
now I'm like getting back into it so my
next favorite is this black bag right
here which I have worn in a few like
recent videos so you guys may recognize
it but it looks like this it's like a
square kind of taupe looking bad so the
bag does expand a little bit when you
unzip it which is cool and I don't know
I just think it looks very mature and it
kind of reminds me of like a saline bag
in a way but it was like twenty dollars
so hello amazing deal so I've just been
really liking this bag and it pretty
much just goes with everything and
anything in my closet since it's black
my next favorite has to do with
electronics and it is my ipad mini
keyboard that i now use as a case it is
by the brand zag and it's actually funny
because the way that I discovered this
keyboard was through all of the ABS that
I've been seeing on YouTube lately I
don't know if it's been showing up for
you guys but these zag commercial for
this keyboard has been playing literally
in front of all of the videos that I've
been
watching and it worked on me the second
I saw the commercial I was sold and I
had to get it it's kind of cool because
you can like turn on the lights for the
keyboard so you can change it from
different colors so you can make it
brighter and they've got literally every
single color which i think is so fun so
when you're typing the dark it could be
like colorful I don't know it just makes
me happy when I look at it so I mean
like this keyboard it's nice because I
do a lot of emailing on my iPad as well
as texting I like to text off this and
stuff it's just very convenient and nice
and I like it a lot my next favorite is
my only like food is related favorite
and it would have to be the Swiss Miss
milk chocolate cake ups the holidays are
coming so of course I had to get some
hot chocolate because I love hot
chocolate so freaking much to taste so
good and yes so I do have a Keurig
machine which is like the best thing in
the entire world if you don't have it
already asked your parents because it
just makes tea and coffee and hot
chocolate so much easier to make it
faster so they just come in these little
cups and you put in the machine and you
have hot chocolate in 10 seconds so it's
just a very nice little treat that I
like to have my last favorite is not an
object but it is making YouTube videos
for you guys if you may have noticed
during the month of October I kind of
stepped up my game with my editing and
my consistency and recently I've just
been obsessed with making YouTube videos
it makes me so happy reading your guys's
comments and tweets and everything and I
don't know YouTube is just so much fun
and there was a point in time kind of
towards like the beginning of school and
a summer where I literally uploaded like
five videos in one month and now i'm
uploading like every other day so I've
just been really happy with my channel
lately and I've been trying to put in as
much effort in time as I can into my
editing you guys have definitely noticed
that I kind of stepped up my game with
my editing because it is literally like
my favorite part about filming I think
it's so much fun a lot of you guys think
like I don't edit that anymore but I do
I sit in my room for six hours and just
edit videos until 5am
but I love it so much it's so fun and
I'm so glad that you guys are
recognizing you know like the quality of
my most recent videos and it just makes
all of it worth it so I'm just really
happy that you guys have been enjoying
my videos lately and all the way I'm not
annoying you guys with videos every
other day because it's it's a lot to
take in every week I know let me know if
I should slow down because I don't know
if you guys are like sick of me yet but
I've just been obsessed with uploading
so that is it for this video I hope you
guys enjoyed it I will try to throw in a
few of my favorite music favorites of
the monster all have those links down in
the description box but yeah that's it
thanks so much for watching and stay
tuned for my next video because I'm
really excited about it it's gonna be
really cool so I'm excited for you guys
