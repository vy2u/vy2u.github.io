then you are watching a Claudius loose
key video right now can you believe it I
can't believe it so I haven't seen you
guys in probably like six years no it's
been two weeks but it feels like six
years October has been a pretty crazy
month for starters I filmed my first
scripted series it was so much fun I was
in New Mexico for about two weeks and
right after that I joined the Reese's
Tour with L'Oreal where I basically
spoke to students above the marketing
side of YouTube and stuff some of that
took place in California I also to Texas
after that so I've kind of been all over
the place this month so anyways today's
video is going to be a favorites video
because I haven't done one of these in
so long and I've got quite a few things
to show you guys but before I get into
that I was cooking like to thank today's
assistant Jerome adalah drew is going to
be throwing me my first favorites for
the month of October it would have to be
the laura mercier translucent powder
this is the best translucent powder that
I've ever tried it's kind of annoying
working with a loose powder because it
gets everywhere but I really do like how
matte it makes my face a plus from me so
my next favorite is the Bobbi Brown
foundation stick and this is in the
shade chestnut and the reason I want to
talk about this is because lately I have
been doing contouring with cream
products which usually I do that with
bronzers so it's been really fun kind of
playing with my makeup and I really
really like this one I think the color
is perfect because it's darker it's a
little more warm toned so it definitely
kind of warms up your face ready for the
next one
I am so excited to be talking about this
one this is the hourglass highlighter
trio so when you open it up you've got
three different highlighters and they're
not too chunky or glittery it's
definitely very subtle which I love
because for the most part I like very
matte makeup in here you've got dim
lights in and can incandescent English
funny
incandescent light I'll agree that you
can definitely it's a weird word yeah
what is it I don't know what it means
and then there's radiant light as well
so I pretty much like these all equally
they're super cute super fun next up we
got a handful of it Oh God oh this is
not gonna work
this is not gonna work okay just go just
go just go let me go get the others
Claudia and her prime right now these
suckers right here are magical these
liquid lipsticks are from Jeffrey star
and I think this is his only product out
right now I'm not quite sure but as you
can see I have a ton of them because I
am obsessed with the formula and the
colors are so unique and awesome I'm
actually wearing one of them on my lips
right now and this is the shade posh
spice which is kind of like a brownish
gray concrete I kind of look dead type
of look but I'm really really into it
right now do we have a celebrity skin
which is definitely still more Brown but
it kind of has more like a nude color to
it these three are a little crazier
we've got unicorn blood which is your
perfect Burgundy brick red we've got
this crazy blue one which is called blue
Velvets oh my god it looks so fun it's
insane it's oh my gosh you really step
out when you wear this one and then
lastly we've got an all-black one
because I love
look of black lipstick if you wear it
well and keep everything else simple it
looks so awesome for this time of year
and this one is the shade of weirdo so
those those are those that yeah that's
love those yep next one next up we've
got a mascara and this is the benefits
roller lash mascara it really just kind
of makes my lashes thicker and longer
but it keeps them separated so they
don't look chunky or clump together
anything next up and this is the last
one right for makeup my last one is a
concealer and this is by the brand Javon
Chi it's their teint contour and type
something-something
embellishing concealer I'm not even
gonna try to picture those words but
this comes on I think three or four
different shades and this is in the
shade number three I really like using
this around my nose area and around my
eyes and I just find that it doesn't
slip around or anything and it has
really great coverage so that is all for
the makeup favorites now for the fashion
favorites these you guys have been
seeing these all over my Instagram there
by the brands j / slides and actually
got these off of nasty on Comm they were
on the South section for I think like
$35 or something insane like that so I
feel like I got super lucky with these
I've just really been obsessed with this
color lately I think I think everyone
can agree with that this this is I this
is me a shoe hey we've got another pair
of shoes so these I got while I was in
London for the Apple music festival
and these are from the store I think
Nuala kay they look so cool they've got
a pointed toe they're leather all the
way around and then they just lace up at
the top so I think they look very
feminine but also very like if you get
on my bad side imma kill you with this
heel and slit your throat and now it's
just getting really grass
so where you can move on to the next
pair of shoes my precious babies ready
oh I'm ready
Oh
so these by far have been my favorite of
all favorites I got these in London as
well and they are just tall a black over
the knees suede boots they're by the
brand Stuart Weitzman's they're super
super comfortable it's the perfect
amount of heel and I just have only
great things to say about these so
seriously ever ever analyzed fashion
favorites adidas has been everywhere I
people are wearing their shoes their
pants they're what else are they gonna
come out with your wax cleaners you guys
know that California weather is pretty
much summer all year around so you can't
really wear very thick and heavy jackets
so this is kind of like the perfect
amount of warmness and stuff I'm really
having troubles describing things today
as you can see I just think it's so cute
it's perfect for traveling and things of
that nature so good I must just say good
drew throw me my next one here is my
next favorite it is a book and it is an
audio book because honestly who has time
to read real books nowadays not me
so you guys know that I have been really
into audible lately I have the app on my
iPad and it's super great it's being
able to just take it around and listen
to audiobooks whether I'm driving or I'm
just chilling outside on the roof I
quickly wanted to talk about a book that
I've been loving to you guys and it is
called how to heal your life and the
author is Louise hey I hope I'm
pronouncing that right
I had this book recommended to me a few
months back and I finally decided to
listen to it and it is so it's so good I
just think that the author has such a
good message that she's sending out it's
super positive I'm all about like
self-improvement books and just kind of
books that make you feel better about
yourself and kind of motivate you to
live your life to the fullest and be
confident in yourself so if you guys are
looking for a good book to read I highly
highly recommend it or if you want to
