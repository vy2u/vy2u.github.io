my October favorites video and I don't
really have too much you know fashion
makeup Beauty type of favorites but I do
have a lot of other non-related of that
subject favorites so yeah I'm just gonna
get right into it I don't really have
any other intro to say or whatever so
the first product is my covergirl nature
luxe foundation you guys probably have
all heard this mac bar bo7 talks about
this all the time and I'm pretty sure
that that girl knows what she's talking
about so when I was at Target I just
decided to buy it because my old one was
running out and I'm actually very very
impressed by this stuff this is in 350
oak that's my shade I like it a lot it's
like a medium coverage which is perfect
because it's not like too light it's not
too heavy it's just right in the middle
which is what I like I like this stuff a
lot because it stays on so so so well
because from for like the last three
weeks I've had the swimming unit in gym
class which is you know going underwater
getting your face wet and all that stuff
and this was seriously a lifesaver for
me during the swimming unit and I had
gym first period okay that sucked so
much but basically I would put this one
on before school and I would go in the
pool you know go put my head under water
many times throughout the class period
when I come out of the pool my
foundation seriously didn't move at all
I honestly think this stuff is like
waterproof it didn't smudge it didn't go
down it didn't like move around or
anything it stayed throughout the whole
day so I didn't have to touch up on my
face at all which was really awesome so
this stuff stays on so well and I like
it a lot so I'm definitely gonna be
using this for a long time next is a
steel eyeshadow in Java and this was
actually my mom's it's really really old
I hope they still sell it I'm not sure
but this isn't like the total old-school
packaging which is like the paper and
I'm pretty sure I've talked about this
before but I kind of like forgot about
it and now I'm really obsessing over it
again
and it's just a very dark kind of like
moko we colored eyeshadow and I like a
lot because it's very like versatile you
can use this as an eyeliner on the top I
like to smudge it on the lower lash line
you could put in the crease really
lightly and just kind of blend it in a
lot so like deepen up you know your look
have like a smokey eye I don't mind you
can use this for so so so much this is
seriously like the most pigmented
eyeshadow I've ever owned watch this one
swipe do you see that and it's already
like as opaque as the eyeshadow itself
so this is a really really great
eyeshadow quality definitely love Stila
shadows and stephannie check it out if
you would like something like this great
now my hands are all dirty whoo so the
next pack that I want to talk about is a
nail polish and it is the white wilds
nail color in lust and it's kind of like
a raspberry dark raspberry pink /
fuchsia pink that's my description of it
and the weird thing about me is I don't
I feel like used to never wear pink
nails except if it was like a colder
kind of pink color like maybe like a
baby pink or like a natural looking
thing but I never ever wore red or dark
pink nails or really like warm colored
pink nails because I was always kind of
like a cooler toned person but like for
the last like week or two I've just been
obsessing over this color I don't know
why I'm wearing on my nails right now
and I just love it so much it's such a
cute like raspberry tinted color I don't
know
ion's I really want to get some lip
glosses some dark lip glosses cuz I
don't own any dark lip lip glosses yeah
that's kind of sad but I love this nail
collage so much it's so cute and lo look
at this brush how cute is that it's so
so yeah I've been loving this it's from
wow you can get this at Target Walgreens
any CBS whatever a dress store so now I
have two hair products that I want to
talk about so the first one is my kqc
flatiron and they did send me this for
free but they don't really know that I'm
making this video I'm going to be doing
a video like a hair tutorial featuring
these products so I'll have a video
talking with all about this another time
later in the future so I'm not really
gonna talk about it too much but I have
been loving this Flatiron so much it
goes up from 140 to 410 degrees
Fahrenheit which is really hot and nice
range of heat for you know different
hair types
and I like it a lot I used everyday
whether it's to curl my hair like today
or to just straighten it it's really
awesome it's very slick I really like
the plates on this they're very smooth
they don't like stop if you know what
I'm saying
you can definitely tell that this is
like a very high quality product that
will last two years so I like that a lot
but also this doesn't really get too hot
here so I'm curling my hair and I touch
it it's like warm but it's not hot so I
also like that too because a lot of hair
straighteners like get really hot here
and you can't touch it so I like that a
lot
the cord is really long I got this from
Flatiron experts.com and also when you
buy like a kqc hair type of styling
product then also they send you this for
free too which is also a part of my
favorites and I'm going to be having a
whole video talking about this Flatiron
later but this is their little heat
protectant I love it so much it sprays
like hairspray which is you know new for
me because I'm used to just using the
Tresemme one and it makes your hair so
shiny and thin not thin shiny and smooth
and stuff like that I just don't like
this smell it smells very manly like I'm
a musky Cologne II smell so I don't like
to smell this I love products so it kind
of equals it out so yeah now I'm gonna
get more in
to kind of fashion and close stuff that
I've just been into this month so first
off is scarves alexei wearing scarves in
this video if you can already see that
and this one is from Burberry Burberry I
got this years ago when I was really
little so I still really like it a lot I
like the Carvey's and then also I've
like a darker one like this which is
like a knockoff I think I got it at like
Marshalls or something but I liked that
one too but I can't find it which is bad
so I actually wore this to school today
and I'm just getting back into the scarf
mode because it is getting chilly out
where I live so love that loss scars
there so kind of I don't know there's so
warm and stuff so I like there a lot
also I've been really loving leggings
which I'm actually wearing right now
with my outfit I love leggings are so
comfy and you know you can really work
with them you can wear dresses with them
you can just kind of you know use
cardigans with them so if I good so I
like those a lot and then also I got two
different types of shoes from Target so
the first ones are these moccasins right
here not gonna lie I wear these all the
time I wear them to school all the time
because I don't really dress up too much
for school because my school is one of
those schools that is really really lazy
like people Oh legit come in sweats and
hoodies all the time and I do that too
because school is just like I don't
really try I don't really try to wash
for school but I try a lot today okay I
I wore a cute outfit today so that's
pretty proud of myself but I love these
so much and I'm a size 7 or an office
size 8 apparently if you guys are
wondering I don't know these were like
20 bucks which is really awesome and
they were like huffy and they're cute
and I love them and then also I got
these which either you guys are going to
hate it or you guys are going to like it
and I actually like them a lot they look
really cute which was like skinny jeans
I'm like
really kind of lazy day and these are
just like these little fried boots you
look cuter when you put them on because
they look kind of flat but they just
look like that and they're the tan
colored ones and they're really comfy
they're kind of like slipper booties but
yeah I actually like them a lot they're
really warm and they're 20 bucks which
is super cheap so I like these a lot
they also come in black and gray but I
like these the most so that is it for
clothes and stuff like that so now I'm
just gonna be talking about non fashion
non beauty non whatever related yeah I
realized that I didn't really have too
much favorites this month but seriously
I didn't buy like anything this month
okay
so now getting on with food obviously
because I love to talk about food yeah
so the first thing is fruit leather and
I don't really have the packaging
because I threw it out but I just got
from Target I love fruit leathers so
much whether it's blueberry whether it's
whether it's raspberry or strawberry
flip-flop can't say it fruit leather is
the bomb I love it so much and if your
parents don't let you get fruit roll-ups
or for the snacks because my parents
don't love me because they think it's
really healthy fruit leather is the way
to go because kind of like a healthy
alternative to that also I've been
loving the Trader Joe's multigrain
crackers I don't have them with me
because I eat them I think we do us and
downstairs mom two days ago but they're
just like these really thin circle
crackers and they're so good I always
have them for lunch every day
all right so the last favourites that I
have are there's actually a lot of them
but something that you don't know about
me is that I love Christmas music you
don't understand I love Christmas music
so much it just brings me into the
Christmas spirit like so much and I feel
like it's one of the best ways to kind
of bring yourself into the Christmas
spirit in my opinion music and candles
and family is the way to go if you want
to be like in that like holiday chair so
I actually have a long list of different
songs that are my favorite Christmas
songs cuz I want to share them with you
guys so I'm just gonna start listing
them off I play them all the time all
day every day
