happening in this viewfinder right now
what can I say staying on brand
hello everybody
welcome back to my channel a today's
video I'm going to be talking about all
of the things that I become obsessed
with within the past month so all of
October if you're planning on taking
anything from this video I highly
recommend pausing right now grabbing a
pen and a piece of paper and start
taking notes because I have found so
many incredible products and items that
I honestly can see myself using for a
very very long time if not the rest of
my life that's a bit dramatic though you
know if any of you follow me on Twitter
snapchat Instagram would know that I
have become obsessed with eating healthy
and working out not that I wasn't doing
it before but I feel like within the
last two-and-a-half months
ish I've really just cranked it up a
notch yeah it's awesome I love it I feel
happier I feel happier about my body my
mind feels clearer just so many benefits
from eating healthy and working out but
anyways we're getting on a tangent here
we can make a fitness video later but
because I've been so obsessed with
health and fitness all that stuff
obviously I have some health and fitness
related favourites the first one is not
a physical favourite and I'm sure so
many of you guys will be able to guess
this one it's a type of workout and that
is soul cycle I did it I joined the cult
moving out here I always knew that it
was a thing and I did it a few times and
I'm deep in it now Lauren Chloe and I go
quite often multiple times a week
definitely I highly highly recommend
trying out SoulCycle it is such a good
workout the music is always awesome
every instructor is different you're
always doing different moves nicely it's
great every instructor is incredibly
attractive and you just sweat your butt
off and that's just like pretty much
what happens now quickly going to dive
into workout attire because I have a few
favorites the first one is any sort of
Nike sports bra I really really love
their sports bras they fit great they're
comfortable this one's probably my
favorite because
love wearing whites I have this specific
style of bra in black and red as well
but this white one has like this little
mesh going on right here with the
stripes which i think looks so cool
secondly I wanted to bring up this
little matched set this is actually my
newest addition to a little workout
drawer
I bought these off of revolve clothing
and the brand is called strut this they
have like a white line at the top and
then at the bottom in the back you have
these white panels and the top is kind
of like a bra top hybrid this brand is
pretty pricey but the quality is insane
super soft stretchy not too thick and
hot where you're like overheating next
up I wanted to bring up a vitamin slash
supplement brand that I've also been
obsessed with and it is called hum you
can purchase these online Amazon there
website you can also buy them at Sephora
that's where I originally discovered
this brand I have a few of their
products and I really really love all of
them but I wanted to show you guys this
one because I feel like everyone can
benefit from this and it would be a
really great kind of tester for anyone
interested in humm this is one of their
combined packs so you've actually got
their red carpet and killer Nails
formulas all the titles are really cute
so this one focuses on glowing skin and
glamorous hair and perfect nails so it's
basically your golden ticket to having
clear skin strong nails strong shiny
hair and it actually freaking works next
up I wanted to bring up two types of
energy drinks that I've been drinking I
don't know I said that weird first up
I've been drinking a lot of matcha
really love matcha it's really good I
purchased this packet from Whole Foods
it's a powerful superfood tea for
sustained energy and mental clarity and
so this is just the raw organic powder
itself I like to throw this into hot
water splash some all milk in there
there's some sweetener yeah it's a
really great source of energy that's not
too insane where you're like
singing off the walls jittery it also
tastes awesome so I really like that and
then secondly I wanted to talk about
Celsius I mentioned this in one of my
newest vlogs so I'm not going to go into
full detail of all of the things here
I'm just going to post a photo or
something so you guys can read for
yourselves yeah they come in awesome
flavors I have these sparkling
watermelon here my favorite is probably
the peach green tea or mango green tea
and that's what it is once again with
the matcha drink this one doesn't make
you too jittery I just find that the
energy kind of lasts all day while
coffee is more like immediate and then
you start crashing sipping it with a
straw today because I don't want to ruin
my lipstick I'm such a girl let's see on
to makeup favorites this is when you
guys pull out your pens and pencils okay
class I'm trying to plan out what to say
about this product because I love it
that much but we're just gonna roll with
it okay so obviously face masks are a
huge thing right now I feel like
everyone's talking about them trying to
find their favorite one all that stuff
Claudia found in her favorite one I
don't even okay alright so this face
mask face Mac um this face Mac is by the
brand fresh and it is their black tea
instant perfecting mask few months ago I
got a tiny little sample of this mask
teeny tiny you think you'd finish this
in like three masks right no this thing
lasted me 12 15 something like that a
little goes a long way with this product
and the reason why I'm bring this up is
because of the price of this um when I
recently purchased this at Sephora I was
a little surprised
um this jar right here is $92 but
honestly it made sense because of how
frickin good it is okay Claudia so why
is this mask so good start talking it
has like a cooling sensation but also
the texture of it is very velvety think
like the benefit Porefessional primer
but on crack so like super velvety super
smooth apply it all over your face after
you've washed it and it's dry and
and it recommends you leave it on for
five to ten minutes I honestly let this
stuff sit for like 15 to 20 because I
like to soak it all in
I kid you not there's a reason why it
says a hydrating treatment that
immediately reveals softer firmer and
healthier looking skin I have never used
a product that has shown results that
quickly
the second you wipe it off your face and
pat dry your skin is perfect it takes
out all of the discoloration your face
just feels and looks like as if you just
came out of the womb you are a fresh
baby
it is incredible smells amazing
continuing on with face products I have
two essentials that I've been using
every single morning and I can see
myself using these every single morning
where's my life until I find something
that somehow magically is better than
these two the first one is nothing new
you guys have heard me talk about this a
bunch but it is the Clinique
dramatically different moisturizing gel
I've tried the lotion in the gel and
kind of gone back and forth with them
but I think I like this one more because
it absorbs quicker straight after
washing my face I like to apply on a
serum a skin serum this is the all
Henriksen I hope I'm pronouncing that
right anti-aging truth serum it's a
collagen booster it's got a bunch of
vitamin C in it it brightens smoothes
and helps the appearance of aging so I
will apply one pump to my hands and
apply it all over my face and then use
the leftover on my neck this stuff
smells awesome it wakes you up it feels
fresh it soaks into your skin within
like 30 seconds so I kind of like like
this and then I just apply on some of
this lotion and then you're good to go
your skin looks amazing and you're ready
for makeup or not whatever you end up
doing through day next up we've got a
lipstick and I'm wearing it right now
I'm actually wearing a combo of two
right now this might be bold and daring
for me to say but I think claudia has
found the most perfect nude lipstick for
her skin type this selfie right here I
got a lot of questions what lip color I
was wearing in this Instagram photo and
this is this is the product this is
actually a multi-use product you can use
on your
eyelids your cheeks your lips this one
is in the shade blondie yeah as far as
the formula it's not too drying but it's
also not too like slippery and glossy I
never end up having to touch it up maybe
once if I'm like out you know eating and
whatever and talking a lot and stuff
like that really love blondie my bike
and as far as the other product on my
lip that I'm wearing right now this is
the buxom lip foundation and under
dressed love this stuff I'll line my
lips with this and then kind of tap this
one in the middle so good oh I just lost
feeling my foot because I was sitting on
it this whole time okay
pins and needles I also threw this onto
my bed I guess I'll mention it but this
is my little workout backpack that I
like to bring to SoulCycle and the gym
but it's from Urban Outfitters
and it's super simple it's got like
thick chunky straps and it's leather on
the bottom it's really good it fits
everything it fits my entire water
bottle inside of it and it's a good time
I think that might be it
Oh music favorites how can I forget let
me just figure that I did not plan this
okay so this one is getting a little bit
old for me but I was so obsessed with it
for like two weeks straight when I first
heard it it's called foreplay by Jaylon
statoil said that sand toy I don't know
who knows that oh that was weird I think
I thought I was gonna play for my phone
and just start playing on my computer
coming just louder
ah it's so good FML by K Flay is so good
blast that song in your car and you're
gonna feel like the baddest boss lady in
the entire world
I love blasting that like windows down
classic girl stuff as far as workout
music when I'm on like the treadmill or
Stairmaster or whatever at the gym move
your body Allen Walker remix by SIA is a
really really good workout song then I
fast start it
that's about it for my music favorites
aka Claudia did not plan this portion of
the video and yeah but obviously I will
link my spot fine down below if you guys
want to stock and listen to any of my
playlists of course follow me on
Instagram Twitter snapchat all those
things will be down there yeah I hope
