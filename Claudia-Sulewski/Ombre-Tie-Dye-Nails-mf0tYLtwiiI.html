needing a white nail polish and also
four to five different shades of the
same color and I'm actually going to be
mixing these two together to create a
fourth kind of you know purple color so
the first one is from wet and wild the
next one is lilac ism from Essie the
third one is great pop from China Glaze
and the last one is first-class ticket
also from China Glaze
so first you want to take the white nail
polish and put it all over your nails
this is going to be used as the base
color and this part is super important
and you guys will see later on in this
video so you just want to make sure that
dries completely so before you actually
start the design make sure to open up
all the bottles just so that you have
them ready and out because you want to
do this process really quickly so first
you're going to start out with the white
nail polish and create a circle or half
circle anywhere on your nail then I'm
going to take the second lightest color
and just create a layer next to it and
you want to make sure to make these kind
of thick so that when you drag them
through all the colors blend together
so this is the color that I mixed the
two nail polishes together so that's why
I'm using a dotting tool for this one
once you've got your last color on
you're going to be using a safety pin to
drag the line serve you do not want to
use a toothpick because that is way too
thick so anything as thin as a safety
pin or anything like that and all you're
gonna do is just drag lines starting
from the whites and then going out and
you want to make sure to wipe the needle
every time you do it so that you don't
get some of that dark purple into the
white and then it's just gonna mess up
so you're just gonna do that as you're
making the line so you can see the white
base underneath which helps kind of tie
in with the tie-dye looks so that's why
we use the white underneath and it's
okay if it's a little bit messy because
of course it's never gonna be perfect
but now I'm just gonna let my nail
completely dry 100% once it's dry I'm
just gonna dip a q-tip into nail polish
remover and just wipe off all the nail
polish that got into my skin then I'm
going to take some of the white nail
polish and just dab it where the white
area is just to kind of clean up the
look once your now has fully dried you
can apply on your favorite top coat and
you are finished
so that is how my whole hand turned out
and also you can see that I started the
white in different areas to kind of give
each nail a more unique look and also if
you notice I do have nail polish all
over my skin because it kind of got
messy but that's okay because it washes
off super quickly so that is it for
today's video
