showing you guys what I wore today and
it's nothing really too crazy it's
pretty simple but I thought it's really
cute so I want to show you guys so
starting off with makeup it's very
simple I'm just wearing eyeliner and
that's really it and then for my hair I
have it in a little top knot bun and I
have some baby hairs kind of sticking
out then for julie i just have these
beaded bracelets which I don't really
know where I got so as for my shirt I'm
wearing this very loose kind of over the
shoulder sweater from pacsun it's
originally from roxy and it's just a
very bright coral color and it's really
pretty because it has kind of like lace
detailing on the sides so i just wore a
nude bando underneath this sweater has
awkwardly short sleeves so I like to
pull it up kind of halfway up my arm
like this and then have it scrunched up
and then also I tucked it in the front
to show off my high waisted shorts and
then just let it hang in the back so my
shorts are from forever21 com I don't
know if you could find them in stores
but i got them online and they're
already sold out but they're just
distress they're kind of like a medium
wash jean i guess they're not really
that dark or that like then i also
paired these pants with a belt and this
spell is also from forever 21 it's just
white and braided and i just made a
little tie the front here with the like
exes belts hanging left so then for
shoes I'm wearing these sneakers which
are also from forever 21 and you guys
have seen these before so that is it for
my outfit as you can see it's pretty
simple but I still think it's really
cute so that's why I want to show you
guys it in a video and that's really it
so i'll talk to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
