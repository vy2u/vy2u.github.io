school which is super exciting and until
like 8:30 right now and school starts in
a couple of hours so I have a lot of
time so today I decided that I would do
an outfit of the day there's an airplane
flying above me right now so I'm going
to show you guys what I did to my hair
and my makeup and what I'm wearing so
first let's start out with what I'm
wearing I'm wearing this dress from
Hawaiian style scum and I will have
their website in the downbar I had a
haul from them a while back before I got
hacked so basically this dress is just
like a plain 2-inch shirt and then it
kind of looks like it has a high-waisted
skirt attached to it and it's just gray
Brown and then pink and it looks like
that's like one of those like little
dolly dresses I don't know I love it so
much and then for shoes I'm going super
casual because it's only school and I
don't want to dress too fancy so I'm
just wearing these plain black sandals
that have pink straps which matched the
bottom of my dress so I'm just wearing
those and then for Julie I am wearing my
Tiffany heart earrings and this long
heart clock necklace that I got for my
friend I'm not sure where she bought it
I'm sorry but I'm wearing that just any
long Julie would work with it and then
I'm not wearing any bracelets but I'm
wearing this crazy ring and this is from
PacSun and I really like it because it's
like really bold and pretty and I don't
know I really like it
and for makeup I am wearing from the
Coastal Scents a beach shimmer palette I
am wearing this color at the top right
here on the lid and then if you go all
the way to the last one this brown one
right here I'm wearing in the crease and
I know I'm wrecking hearts makeup like
made a tutorial about at one time and
I loved it so I'm wearing that and then
I curled my hair and tomato just a
little teeny braided right there to hold
back my front pieces of hair and I use
this curling iron to curl my hair and
this is from Conair and this is super
old and I'm not sure how skinny are like
what size this is if it's like one inch
or whatever but if you guys know like
what sizes is then I'd greatly
appreciate it because I have no idea but
basically I just cut my hair I did not
use the little clamp I just held it
upside down and I wrapped my hair around
the rod and then took it out hold it and
dropped in and just like bounced into a
little curl that's how I curl my hair it
did take a while all right
yeah that's it for today's outfit of the
day also the first day of school I'm
super excited so comment below if you
guys already have school or what you
guys do on the first day of school and
if you guys are excited because I know
that I am so yeah see you guys in
