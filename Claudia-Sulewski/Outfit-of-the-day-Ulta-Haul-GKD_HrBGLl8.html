doing it out for the day and it's going
to be really simple because my alpha is
really simple but it's still kind of
cute and then also one of the main
reasons that I wanted to film today's
video was because recently a couple of
days ago I got some stuff from Ulta calm
and actually did make a halt but not on
here just because my last video as a
whole and it wasn't that much stuff but
I did make a halt on my blog it will be
linked in the downbar so if you want to
check out what I got from Ulta I made
some I took pictures of all the stuff
and I did a bunch of swatches for all
the stuff because I got a lot of lip lip
products and stuff like that so make
sure to check out my all to hell on my
blog usually want to buy stuff I buy
like a really small amount of stuff
where it's kind of like pointless to
make a video if I want to talk about it
for things but I think it's completely
appropriate to make you know a halt on
my blog instead because it's kind of
like easier and faster and stuff so yeah
I'm gonna be doing a lot of halls on my
blog more often now instead of here
unless I got a lot of stuff that i'll
make a video about it you guys know what
I'm saying yeah right okay so yeah let's
get on to my outfit starting out with
Julie I am wearing I know I say that
we're really weirdly i'm wearing my
tiffany bracelet that I wear every day
and then alongside that I'm wearing this
bracelet from jewel mins and i think
it's called the wind stirs set or
something like that I don't know but
it's so cute has a clear crystal and
nice silver detailing and then along to
match with that I'm wearing these
earrings that is also from the same set
so they just look like that also the
cool thing about these earrings is they
actually open up like a little locket as
you can see and then they close and i
don't know i think that's so cute so
yeah for my hair i'm just wearing kind
of a medium height ponytail in the back
and then i just pulled some hairs in the
front to kind of free my face a little
just because i want to show off these
cute little earrings and then i just
pulled my bank back and for my makeup
it's just really really simple and
natural and neutral I guess it's kind of
pinky I put on some new lipstick with
some pink lip gloss over and now for the
outfit so first off I
this shirt it's kind of like a half
length sleeve shirt and I just kind of
pull it up a little bit and this is from
forever 21 it's super old and I've been
worn it and so long so I decided to pull
it out today and it just has sequins
stripes on it it's super pretty it's a
nice gray color and then along with my
shirt I'm just wearing these really dark
skinny jeans from forever 21 and I like
these a lot because they're super
stretchy and stuff so they're really
nice yeah as you can see these are super
dark and then the shoes I'm just wearing
my tory burch flats that I wear all the
time and they're just black and simple
and they match to basically everything
so I love these two deaths plus I
couldn't really find any other shoes to
wear so whenever I don't know what to
wear shoes wise I just pull out the
black flats that's what I did today so
yeah I hope you guys enjoy this super
fast video um I'll so love Germans if
you guys have never tried it out they
have a promo code going on right now
which is just video the IDE oh and caps
and it will give you fifty percent off
on your first selection which i think is
really cool and also make sure to follow
me on twitter which is just Claudia's
life and check out my Ulta will be down
in the down bar I will talk to you guys
later also I think I'm going to be
making a video tomorrow so make sure to
watch out for that it's gonna be
Christmas themed so I'm excited ok bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
