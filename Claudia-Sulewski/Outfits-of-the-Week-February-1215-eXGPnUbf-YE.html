disappearing for a week but last weekend
I had my school dance called girls
choice and that is where the girl asks
the guy and I actually asked my friend
Tommy through a youtube video so you can
check it out it's one of my most recent
videos but that was super fun and also
this week I have been sick all week
which really sucks I still am sick but
at least I got my voice back because
before I literally sounded like I was
dying um so that's why I haven't really
been able to film any videos for you
guys but I decided that I wanted to film
my first outfit of the week's video
today and this entire week I've been
super rushed and late in the morning so
I wasn't able to film the outfits every
single day but I did jot down what I
wore every single day so today I just
put on all the same exact outfits and
just filmed it for you guys so next time
I film and outfits of the week video
I'll try to like film it during the
mornings to make it seem realistic and
you know stuff like that but I hope you
guys enjoy today's video with all that
being said let's go check out what I
wore this week I was too sick to go to
school on Monday so I don't have an
outlet for you guys but for Tuesday I
wore a grayish hoodie and I just pushed
up the sleeves then underneath I am
wearing these thick black leggings that
I rolled up a couple inches and to
finish my outfit off I wore my gray
converse now I want to show you guys the
backpack that I use everyday it's from
Urban Outfitters and I love it so much
I'm gonna start out by showing you guys
the jewelry that I wore on Wednesday so
I wore these triangle earrings and
necklace and then I also wore these
silver thick rings and then for my shirt
I'm just wearing a gray kind of burnt
out looking shirt with a light wash
denim button-up over that and I just
roll the sleeves half way up and then
underneath I'm just wearing the same
exact black thick leggings because they
are so comfortable and then I'm also
wearing my black combat boots from Steve
Madden
for Thursday I'm wearing this white
cropped tank that is kind of see-through
so I wore a floral bralette underneath
and then over that I just threw on a
chunky gray cardigan which kind of has
like this grandpa vibe to it but I
thought it looked cute and then for my
bottoms I'm wearing new pecks on Kendall
and Kylie high-waisted jeans and they're
light wash and I really love them and
then to finish off my outfit I just wore
my black Steve Madden combat boots
Friday's outfit was my favorite I don't
really know why but I just wore a white
muscle tee that says California with
this flannel over top because it's
flannel Friday job and I love this
flannel I love the colors so I just
rolled the sleeves up half way and then
I'm wearing my favorite jeans ever which
are these light washed ripped jeans
shocker and we're in combat boots again
but this was my favorite outfit and Here
I am pretending to go to school when I'm
really just sitting at home on a
Saturday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
