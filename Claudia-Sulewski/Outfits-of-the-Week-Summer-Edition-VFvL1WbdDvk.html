you may notice a few new things on your
screen
I moved I'm in a new bedroom and I have
an entire new background behind me I
know this is gonna be my permanent
background
because I got a lot of different
backgrounds like use but I moved into a
house with three other youtubers and I'm
so freakin pumped and excited and if you
guys had no idea about any of this then
first of all what are you doing with
your summer slash life because I've been
talking all about it on all my social
media websites on my vlog channel so
yeah if you guys want to see what my
room looks like so far because I've been
vlogging the entire process from the
first piece of furniture I bought to my
entire room coming together or if you
guys want an actual tour of the house I
have one up on YouTube you can check out
my second channel which is beyond
restart TV yeah I've basically just been
blogging a bunch pretty much every
single day so if you guys want to check
out all that stuff I will obviously have
it linked in the downbar but that is the
first thing that I wanted to mention
crazy stuff bacon ooh this very excited
new year all that stuff
having a window open what's not a good
idea the second thing that you guys may
notice differently about this video is
my hair color I dyed it about two days
ago and it's kind of like a reverse
ombre so I kept my natural hair color on
the top which actually got pretty dark
but I took out the blondes on the ends
of my hair and I dyed it like a really
dark expresso Brown and I'm so so happy
with it I haven't had dark hair in a
little over two years I would say but
anyways let's get on with today's video
which is going to be in outfits of the
week video I feel like I haven't done
one of these in a very long time let's
bring them back because I like them I
like watching them and making them for
you guys hopefully you do as well I
guess we'll find out but yeah I'm going
to show you guys a bunch of outfits that
I've recently been loving and wearing a
ton and making it into an outfit of the
week format so I'll be showing you guys
seven different outfits because I'm not
here to cheat and go one day to Friday
we're going Sunday to Saturday
forewarning I don't think I'm wearing
any color in any of the office I think
one of them but I think it's already
been established that I for the most
part we're very neutral colors so I
totally know what that is just the face
that I'm going through in life and yeah
that's that's it so let's get to the
video then
yeah
Oh
thank you so much for watching today's
video if you guys enjoyed it then of
course let me know by liking this video

little risky yeah if you guys want to
check out my second channel I will have
it linked down below so you can check

fish and all that stuff I will see you
