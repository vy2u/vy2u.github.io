smooth color stick I'm going to apply
this all over my lips to moisturize them
then using the Urban Decay primer potion
I'm going to prime my lids as well as my
lower lash line then grabbing my Urban
Decay Naked 2 palette I'm going to
choose half-baked with a flat shader
brush and apply this all over my lids
using a small angled brush I'm going to
choose snakebite and apply this on my
upper lash line as well as in my crease
I'm then going to connect the two lines
to create an outer V shape on my lid
using that same eyeshadow with a
blending brush I'm going to apply more
into my crease to darken up the look
now using my naked basics palette from
Urban Decay I'm going to choose foxy to
highlight my brow bone as well as my
inner tear-duct
now using the 88 color eye shadow
palette from Coastal Scents I'm going to
choose an eyeshadow that matches with
the color of my dress and I'm going to
apply this on my lower lash line for a
pop of color I'm also going to bring the
eyeshadow up onto the outer 1/3 of my
lid to pull the eye look together
now using my favorite black eyeliner I'm
going to line the outer half of my
waterline as well as my upper lash line
next I'm using my Revlon eyelash curler
to curl my lashes using my Neutrogena
healthy links mascara I'm going to apply
on two coats of mascara and you can also
wear falsies but I don't like to wear
false eyelashes so I'm just going to
apply on two coats of mascara for blush
I'm using the Mac blush in prism and I'm
going to apply this a little bit
underneath my cheekbones to kind of
contour my face as well as bring some
color for lips I'm using Mac's lipstick
in the shade with and I'm just lightly
dabbing this onto my lips to give them a
lighter flush for more details on my
dress and my prom outfit then you can
check out the blog post that I did on a
Windsor store I will have the link to
that in the downbar now I want to show
you guys a few essentials that you could
bring to help you survive prom so first
off I have these Listerine breath strips
and these are amazing for making your
breath smell fresh I've also got some
floss because you don't want any food in
your teeth while you're taking photos
next up I've got a friction block stick
this is a lifesaver for those of you who
will be dancing in high heels because
you just roll it up and you rub it onto
your heels or wherever and as you can
see it is completely transparent it's
not sticky and it actually smells really
good too
so I just love this stuff I cannot leave
my house without oil absorbing sheets so
I brought these from clean and clear and
I love padding this quickly on my face
throughout the day because you don't
want to have greasy or
looking skin in your prom pictures
lastly I decided to pack some sort of
lip moisturizer as well as a mascara
just so that I can touch up my makeup
throughout the night now I've actually
got a little surprise giveaway for you
guys if you would like to win all of my
prom Survival Guide essentials as well
as a free one-month supply of a QP
context of course for those of you who
wear glasses then all you have to do is
like the clean and clear and a Q V
Facebook pages and comment on this video
telling me you're number one at Beauty
essential for school dances and I will
randomly be choosing a winner and
exactly one week from now
an hour and 40 minutes later and finally
done filming done yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
