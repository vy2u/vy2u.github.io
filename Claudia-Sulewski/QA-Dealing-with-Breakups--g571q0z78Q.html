yes I am so crazy but I quickly wanted
to give a shout out to it this video
that I filmed with quest nutrition for
the launch of their new flavor it was so
awesome and so fun there were a bunch of
youtubers involved and things get a
little messy so I would definitely
recommend clicking on this box right
here to watch it or in the link in the
description now back to the video how
are you doing I hope your day night
whatever it may be is going very well
before we get started I quickly wanted
to mention that I'm sick right now so if
I sound nasally at all or if I do this
throughout the video
then that is why but today's video is
going to be a Twitter Q&amp;amp;A so I tweeted
you guys to ask me questions with the
hashtag ask Claudia which by the way if
you want to follow me on Twitter it's
Claudia so loose key I tweet amazing
things
inspirational emotional string pulling
string pulling tweets every day maybe
not every day so I picked out a few of
my favorite questions and I'm going to
be answering them today so let's get
started the first question asks what's
your favorite video you've ever posted
on your channel I would say as of
recently my favorite video that I've
ever made was my lookbook that I made
with Drew it's called screening it's
more of like a fashion film type of
thing we just had a lot of fun but if
you guys haven't seen that video I will
link it right here it turned out so
freakin cool and I wanted to give it a
little shout out because I feel like by
the title and thumbnail you might be
confused what it is but it is like my
baby of all the videos that I've ever
made so if you guys want to check that
out I'll have it here as well as in the
downbar
is it hard to keep up with your
Instagram theme and how long did it take
you to think of it I feel like Instagram
themes first of all are kind of becoming
a little overrated at least in my
look I'm kind of getting over it I feel
like at this point I just kind of post
the photos that I want to post but
usually use the same filter every time
and I think if you do that you naturally
just kind of create your own theme I
think the whole point is to not really
stress too much about it just post
whatever photos you like but I would say
my tips for having a successful theme or
whatever is to kind of stay within the
same color family as far as what you're
taking pictures off and then like I said
before just choose a filter that you
like and throw it on there I personally
dabble with a 8 a 9
sometimes a 6 and there's a new one that
I really like if you have no idea what
I'm talking about and talking about vsco
cam
se3 is really nice I'm liking that one
as well I feel like I just shared a very
valuable secret to you guys I just I
just gave it out there for all of you to
know now now you know that's probably my
number one ask question ever that's a
little sad if you could choose one song
to listen to for the rest of your life
which would it be this is such a hard
question for me to answer because I
don't have a specific music genre that I
enjoy listening to I'm really all over
the place when it comes to listening to
music and it's always changing let me
look through my Spotify and see I think
all in all I would say I listen to
mostly alternative music whether it's
like alternative pop or indie or
alternative rock just like that umbrella
of music I really enjoy this was kind of
an old one but I always really do enjoy
listening to breeze blocks by alt-j
Jersey no fevers feed me again never
kisses so do you ever send a post oh
yeah so I really like that song and then
also here's a song that actually really
really been enjoying lately I used to
listen to it a ton but I like
rediscovered it in my head a few weeks
ago it's down the line by Jose Gonzales
I'm so sad
they song
yeah so I really like those two songs I
feel like I can listen to them when I'm
happy I'm sad I'm excited I'm whatever
also if you're wondering where my phone
case is from its from wildflower cases I
love them so much and this one I've been
using for like months now you guys
always see it in my pictures and ask
let's get back to the Q&amp;amp;A though we're
getting a little off track funniest
moment with Lexi Jack and drew which if
you guys don't know who they are they
are my roommates oh my gosh this is so
hard to answer on the spot I feel like
in general we always have just like
really funny memories that happen in the
house on just random days the first
thing that I could think in my head was
this one night it was probably like a
weekend night or something I don't even
know but we're all home and we had a few
other friends over and somehow our night
led into us turning off all the lights
in our house and just having a dance
party in pitch black it was so funny
surprisingly no one got hurt but
literally like it was pitch black like
we couldn't see what we're doing we were
just dancing and being idiots and then I
remember I downloaded like a strobe app
on my phone so we started playing with
like a strobe light and yeah I think
just in general like having those nights
where we're all home and we just like
create our own fun from some silly joke
or 2d or whatever usually ends up being
like the memories that stand out in my
head the most because they're kind of
like genuine and homey and it makes us
feel like this family that we've created
together and it's just really cute so if
any of you guys are watching this video
I love you and I'm so glad I live with
you guys okay we get a little emotional
here out of funky effects to this tweets
oh challenge accepted oh yeah I have no
idea what I'm gonna do but I'm gonna do
something weird with this with this
tweet the next question asks if you
could only follow one person on Twitter
who would it be and 100% it would be
Andrew Lau if you guys don't follow him
you have to right now because his tweets
are so funny
I love his sense of humor just the way
he tweets everything just he's great are
you satisfied and done with your new
room at the moment I am very satisfied
with my room I actually only have one
more thing that I need and it's making
me so mad because I'm not getting it
until so much later if you guys watch
anyway vlogs then you would know that I
ordered a bed literally like a week
after moving here I'll show you guys a
picture of the bed that I ordered is
from West Elm it's grey and it's got
this super awesome like high headboard
and it's a queen size which right now I
have a full so I'm very excited to
upgrade when I ordered it it said that
it wouldn't come until October and I
decided what the heck I'm just gonna get
it I know it'll be worth it but recently
I got an email saying that it got it
back ordered again and it won't be
shipped out until late November does
anyone else have issues with West Elm
online ordering or something like that
because I know Lexi did with her bed
it's making me so freaking frustrated I
just want the bed to complete my room
but once I have that then I'm all good
do you still want to get a Roman numeral
for tattoo inside of your pinkie yes I
there's actually two tattoos that I
really want I want like a little Roman
numeral four right here I don't know if
I've ever explained the meaning of it to
you guys it represents two different
things the first thing is that four has
always been like my lucky number it's my
favorite number and like somehow I'm
always able to manifest it in my life
like literally there's four of us living
in this house I have four decorative
pillows in my room my nose is getting
really clogged there are four rows of
pictures on my picture frame and I think
it looks perfect because of that like
it's crazy how four is just like
everywhere
around me I have four packs of gum in my
thing this is now I just sound like your
crazy person that's the first reason the
second one is the way that it's written
out each line segment kind of represents
a family member in my family I'm not
going to go into specific detail of who
is which line because like it literally
takes so long to describe it but when I
say to people they're like oh my god how
did you come up with this it's cool but
I really want to get that and also I
want to get a little a too on my little
tragus right here that represents
something else so I want that oh my gosh
I feel like I need to blow my nose I'm
slowly falling apart how did you deal
with your breakup I feel like in general
I always manage to deal with these type
of situations very easily in my life at
least looking back on all the
relationships that I have and I think
the reason why it's easy for me to kind
of handle situations like this is
because every time something happens in
life where it's not you know ideal in
the moment you kind of just have to look
at the positive side of that situation
for me I took it as an opportunity to
kind of rebuild all of the friendships
that I have with my roommates and all my
close friends here because it was
definitely a very intense relationship
and when you get sucked in so much
sometimes you forget to balance out the
rest of your life and nourish you know
your relationships with your friends and
your family and your friends back home
and all these different you know
components of life and stuff so I kind
of took it as an opportunity to kind of
rebuild those and work harder for myself
as far as my well-being my work in
general kind of things like that so I
took it as kind of like a window of
opportunity to work on other things and
focus on stuff that really matters in my
life right now I'm so comfortable in my
own skin and what I'm doing and
everything feels so right so I think my
biggest advice for any of you guys that
are dealing with breakups or any type of
you know like loss in your life as far
as a partner or best friend or anything
like that so much good can come out of
something that might seem bad at the
time
but everything happens for a reason and
every person that comes into your life
they come into your life for a reason
you're going to learn lessons and gain
experience and all that stuff that would
be my advice is just kind of to look at
you know the other end of the stick and
sometimes you don't realize how bright
the road in front of you is until you
get there do you have any regrets in
your life this is a really good question
I know everyone always says this but I
believe it's so much and the saying is
that you only regret what you don't do
because I'm sitting here trying to think
of different things that I've done and I
don't regret anything that I've ever
done the only times that I ever felt
like regretful for anything were the
times that you know I didn't speak up in
a certain situation or I didn't do what
my gut was telling me to do or things
like that yeah I feel like that's
something that I've just been working on
a bunch within the last years of my life
just in general like taking action when
I want to and kind of taking advantage
of the now and doing things when it
comes to your head rather than waiting
on it or not telling someone something
or whatever stuff like that because at
the end of the day you literally only
have one life on this earth as of we
know because we don't know what happens
after death so why not spend it doing
the things that your insides are telling
you to do if there's something that
you've been wanting to say or do and
it's not causing any harm to the earth
or others then you have every right to
do it because it's your body it's your
life everything you should do it
motivational speaking with Claudius
loose key on to the next question set a
timer on your phone and see how long you
can hold your breath okay I feel like
I'm not going to be on my a-game because
I'm sick but I'm not gonna use that as
an excuse let me get some deep breaths
here
as if I could actually do this ready
okay I probably could have gone longer
honestly but I reached 36 seconds that
is a lot longer than I expected so cool
okay next up what is your favorite
Starbucks drink well it depends on the
mood that I am going into it because
usually I have two different drinks that
I'll get if I'm looking for something
that's more like refreshing I'll usually
get a venti iced unsweetened green tea
and I'll put two packets of some sort of
sweetener in it I try to get stevia if I
have it on me but if I don't I'll use
like Splenda that tastes so good I
usually have that that's like my number
one drink but if I'm trying to go for
like a coffee drink and I need a lot of
energy then usually I will get a grande
iced skinny vanilla latte with almond
milk if they don't have almond milk I do
soy milk that's my drink and the last
question for today's video asks do you
still wake up to hot and colds by Katy
Perry every morning I had to put this in
the video because I could not believe
that you remember this oh my gosh I
don't even know which video I talked
about this in but in I think middle
school I don't know if I did in high
school but definitely middle school I
had hot nicole's by Katy Perry set as my
alarm on my iPad and I woke up to it
every single morning and I loved it I
don't know it was just such a good way
to wake up and know I don't have that
anymore because I usually just kind of
wake up on my own time every single day
unless I have you know work or some sort
of call time but usually how much to
actually wake up around 8:00 a.m. but
I'm really considering repurchasing it
on iTunes just to have that as my
ringtone when I need it alarm clock not
ringtones my mistake but that is it for
today's video thank you to everyone who
tweeted me your amazing questions I had
so much fun filming for you guys and
I love making just sit-down videos where
we get to talk sometimes my camera
decides to just turn off out of nowhere
that was such a special moment we were
sharing and it just it shut off on us so
rude I have so much fun filming these
videos for you guys because I feel like
they're very personal and chill and
everything if you guys want a closer
look into my life and watch more
personal videos like this then be sure
