stressed out so today I'm using these
skin Iceland hydro cool firming eye gels
and they're just the perfect way to help
you de-stress and hydrate your eyes so
I'm putting these on before my makeup
for 10 minutes and then I'm going to
peel them off so now I'm gonna skip a
right to eye makeup so I'm starting out
with this benefit cream eyeshadow and
I'm just applying this all over my lid
and a little bit into my crease for my
base the first eyeshadow I'm using is
the NYX single eyeshadow in the shade
you d queen and it's just a fun and long
wearing color so I'm going to apply this
all over my lid and then I'm also going
to heavily drag it into my crease and
really extend it out for that smoky look
I'm also taking that same color and just
dragging it down into my lower lash line
now taking my Naked 2 palette in the
shaved chopper I'm going to apply this
in the center of my eyelids to brighten
up the look overall and then grabbing
foxy from the same palette I'm going to
highlight my upper brow bone my inner
tear-duct
as well as underneath my lower lash line
because I feel like it helps to clean up
the look
from my upper lashline i'm going to be
using my Urban Decay 24/7 liquid
eyeliner and just creating a very small
and subtle wing and for my waterline I'm
using the star luxe obsidian Kohl I
pencil and it's just a very soft and
black eyeliner that was found all day so
I'm just applying that on my upper and
lower waterline after curling my lashes
I'm using the it's so big volumizing
mascara to help add some volume and
lengthen my lashes
time for lips okay the first color I'm
using is the MAC lipstick in a shade
rebel which is just a very dark purple
magenta looking color and I'm just
applying this all over my lips
next up I'm using my Kaitlyn tinted lip
balm in the shade of Big Apple which is
crazy crazy pigmented I'm just applying
it on the center of my lips on the top
and bottom and it's also very matte so
it's just gonna stay on all day and it
looks so pretty with a rebel lipstick so
last but not least my blush I'm just
choosing a very subtle Mac blush in the
shade prism and applying that on my
cheeks
now I was actually wearing gel nail
polish so I decided to paint my toenails
in the shade lamaze from a butter LONDON
