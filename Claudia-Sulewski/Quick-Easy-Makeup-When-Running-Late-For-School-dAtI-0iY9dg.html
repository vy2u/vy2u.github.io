such a good night's rest and your bed is
all warm and cozy and you're having the
best dream ever and then you realize
what time it is
oh no sometimes we only have five
minutes to get ready and look somewhat
presentable way down sometimes you just
got to do what you got to do but let's
try this again when I'm in a hurry
my best friend is BB cream it
moisturizes your face but gives you the
coverage you need using my fingers I'm
going to Pat the Maybelline a dream
fresh beauty balm onto my face
I'm also going to target it into any
other areas that need extra coverage
because this product is super buildable
when you've only got five minutes to get
ready you don't have time for eyeshadow
so we're going to take this BB cream and
apply it on our lids to cover up any
veins after that I'm going to grab my
benefit lolli tint cheek stain and just
apply it on the apples of my cheeks this
product will live up your face and give
a natural flush to your cheeks I never
leave my house without filling in my
eyebrows so this has become one of my
essential steps using the master shape
eyebrow pencil I'm filling in my
eyebrows then brushing them out with the
spoolie on the other end
Boldin to find eyebrows can really help
to frame a face
after that I'm grabbing my master
precise eyeliner from maybelline and
applying that on my upper lash line I'm
just going to be creating a very thin
line in a small wing doing this will
help define your eyes and make it look
like you spent a lot more time doing
your makeup than you actually did
apply on mascara has also become one of
my most essential steps so I'm taking my
makeup forever mascara and just applying
it to my upper and lower lashes applying
on mascara can help to open up your eyes
and really make them pop
last but not least the lips I'm taking
my NYX butter gloss in the shade apple
strudel and just applying it all over my
lips this coral shade is fun but also
very subtle for an everyday makeup look
be sure to watch all of my other
