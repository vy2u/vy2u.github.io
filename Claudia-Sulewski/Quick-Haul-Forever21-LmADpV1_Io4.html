filming a quick little haul because I
just went shopping with my friend
Michelle today at the mall and I got a
couple of things so it's gonna be kind
of short kind of long I don't know but
yeah so first before I show you guys you
know what I bought and stuff like that I
just want to show you something that I
did a couple days ago just kind of a new
thing I guess do you guys remember this
purse
it had juicy letters and they were like
neon and I told you guys how I never
used it cuz it's just like if you never
matched you know it's just way too like
bright so like two days ago I took black
nail polish and I painted over all of
the little spikes so now it's like my
new little favorite like bag right now
cuz it matches like to everything now so
I'm so happy I did that because now it
just looks a lot more less childish I
guess even though I know I'm like
basically still a child but like you
know it's not as like what BAM so it's
more like kind of edgy looking and kind
of more classic since it's all black so
I like that a lot that's not really a
haul related thing but it is kind of
like a new thing that has happened in my
life okay so yesterday I actually went
to Plato's Closet with my mom and I just
got two things so might as well just
include that in here but most of this is
all from forever 21 so the first thing
is just the simple black dress it just
had really pretty beading right here it
doesn't really have any shape to it
looks like that yeah I don't know
usually it was really cheap so it was
look good and then also I got this shirt
to eff widows closet and I think it's
very very cute it looks like this it's
like a plain just gray shirt but I
thought that neckline was really pretty
it's like really it goes really high up
which is where I like I've really been
liking that and also in the back it
looks like that and then you like button
it right there so I thought that was
very cute and girly oh and by the way
I've been like obsessed with Gossip Girl
I feel like everyone's like upsizing
gossip right now cuz it just went on
Netflix and Gossip Girl has inspired me
by doing so many
which I will explain so the first thing
is definitely clothes style I got a lot
of cute like girly stuff today because I
usually wear like not girly stuff at
school I just kind of wear whatever so
now for the forever 21 stuff the first
thing I got was a coat because I really
wanted like a cute dressy coat not like
you know like an intense winter coat so
I got this one from forever 21 I love it
so much oh my goodness I guess I've just
stand-up kind of you can kind of see it
it's like it has those buttons that go
across and you like cross button it and
then it has like a little belt thing
that you wrap around and it's so cute
it's kind of like a longer coat but oh
my gosh you look so pretty with jeans so
I love that this was $27 which is so
cheap for a coat so it was kind of like
a must then also I got two jeans just
because all my jeans are like way too
big on me because I suck at shopping for
jeans so the first are just and these
both were $10.50 which is an amazing
deal for jeans and these are also for 21
so I just got some dark really dark
skinny jeans and then also I got black
ones because I've never had black jeans
before and I like him a lot and these
are just also like skinny jeans but
they're black so the next thing I got
was a lip gloss and this is the love and
beauty lip glosses in red and this is
another thing that I had got inspired by
from you know Gossip Girl and that's
because Serena she's the main character
I'm like in love with her because her
fashion style and just everything about
her I just love it so much
that sounds really creepy but in a
non-creepy way and one thing one of the
thing that Shores has is like dark lips
whether it's like berry lips or red lips
but it's just always dark like everybody
has dark lips in that show and that kind
of inspired me to kind of break out of
my new lip shell so I'm actually wearing
this lip gloss right now and it's really
really sure I was kind of disappointed
so I'm gonna start buying a lot more
darker lip glosses because this is the
first lip gloss that's a dark that I've
ever owned and I don't know I'm wearing
I'm not wearing new lips today which is
just kind of shock
that was like when I looked in the
mirror I was like what the heck I was
just not used to it so overall I don't
really recommend getting it just because
it's really sheer and it's not a really
good color payoff and I guess it's not
sticky but I don't know it's it's not as
stark as I wish it was then also I got
this little what's it called
head headband thing but this is for
winter the one that covers over your
ears it's just black and it's knit it
has a cute little flower so it looks
really cute when you you know put on
your head so go enter time when I'm cold
and then I got three dresses from far 21
so this is like what kind of inspired me
from Gus we're all just to kind of dress
more dressier and I'm not gonna wear
these to school obviously but they're
gonna be for if I go out out of town
like with my friends or something or if
I have like family parties or Christmas
and New Year's all that stuff so yeah
okay so the first dress looks like this
and it's just a dark grey color
and first when I saw it I was like but
actually when I tried it on it is like
one of the most beautiful dresses I've
ever owned and it looks like this it's
really really fitting it's really tight
and short and it's dark grey but I just
love the cut it has like a little slit
right here and it looks so pretty it has
like a really high neck which I've once
again I said like I said before I'm
really loving and it just zips up like
that it looks so pretty on your body oh
my gosh it's so pretty
okay and this dress was $19 oh the
lipstick was a dollar and then the
headband was five dollars so this was a
twenty dollar dress so the next one is
also a dark color and this one is very
very cute it's just a black dress and
it's like tight and it has kind of an
interesting pattern to it but the cool
thing is it has it's like see-through at
the waist just like a really small strip
so it's not too bad and then at the top
it's also and so it looks like it'd be a
tube top tube top dress but then it has
like this mesh on top and also on the
back and there's just like a zipper
going down back and it looks really
really pretty I think this would look
really pretty with like black tights and
some black like wedge buoys you know for
like a night out for dinner
something like that with a family and
the last oh I always forgot to say the
prices this was $22 and then the last
dress is my most favorite purchase of
today and this is probably the prettiest
dress that I've ever held in my hands of
her because it's just so beautiful I'm
so I'm so in love with it so it looks
like this and also it's like pretty
tight it's like a new color and it's a
long-sleeved dress the sleeves are
really really tight and fitting to your
arm but the best part about it is it has
like an open kind of area for your
shoulder so it just kind of lays nice
and your shoulder kind of peeks through
and it has this beautiful beautiful
beautiful like detailing on both sides
oh my goodness when you put it on it's
so pretty they only had like two of
these left in store and I got the last
small size so I was it was like destiny
like right when I walked in there I like
saw it somewhere in this random section
I was like oh my god I need that and
this dress was only $29 oh it's kind of
spent it was like 30 bucks
so yeah this dress concludes my haul
that is it for taste video and I hope
you guys enjoyed it and I'll see you for
another one
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
