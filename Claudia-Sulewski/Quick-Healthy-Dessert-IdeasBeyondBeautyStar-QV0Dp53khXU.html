a little bit different from what I
normally do I'm going to be showing you
guys a bunch of different dessert ideas
and recipes that you guys can create and
these are all very very healthy and very
easy to make you guys to see that some
of them only require like two or three
ingredients so if you guys would like to
try any of these up and keep on watching
and be sure to tweet me or Instagram me
photos if you guys create any of these
recipes and tell me what you guys think
because I personally love all of them
so keep on watching so we're first going
to start off with the banana ice cream
all you're going to need to make this
ice cream is one banana and these are
super high in potassium vitamins b6 and
C they give you a ton of energy they're
low in sodium they're basically these
super fruits so all you're going to do
is cut your banana into slices to make
your blenders job a little bit easier
once you've finished cutting them up
just place them in the freezer overnight
or until they're completely frozen
after that you just want to place your
bananas into a blender I'm using the
nutribullet you may have to shake it up
or mix it around because the banana gets
a little stuck in the blades but as you
can see here the blender starts to whip
up the banana into the perfect ice cream
texture it's actually crazy how much it
feels like ice cream after that you're
going to want to choose what toppings
you want to put onto your ice cream and
really try to go for healthier options
there are so many that you can do so as
you can see here I'm doing some shaved
almonds and some berries and I love the
almonds because they give this really
nice crunch to it so it basically tastes
like a homemade frozen yogurt next up
we've got the cacao cinnamon yoghurt
which is one of my favorites and it's
super easy to make so first off you're
going to need some Greek yogurt I'm
using Cho Bonnie's plain non-fat yogurt
and there's so many good things about it
so there are a few listed down below
you're also going to need some cacao
nibs which are great substitutes for
chocolate because they're super crunchy
and they've got that taste but they're
also very healthy for you and lastly I'm
going to throw in some cinnamon because
I personally love the taste of it and
it's so great for your body
I'm going to start out by plopping some
of the Greek yogurt into a bowl and
depending on how hungry I am I normally
do about a cup of yogurt or a little bit
less after that you just want to take
your cinnamon and sprinkle some on top I
like to put on a bunch because I love
the taste of it and last but not least
you just want to take some cacao nibs
and just sprinkle them on top I love
this recipe because the Greek yogurt is
very tart but you also get that sweet
crunch from the cacao nibs so it just
gives a really nice balance to the meal
next up we've got chocolate butter rice
cakes which are so good guys so first
off you're going to need some rice cakes
I like to get mine from Quaker
and these are gluten free they've got 9
grams of whole grain and they're only 35
calories per cake
the only other ingredient you'll be
needing is some pb2 I personally like to
use the premium chocolate kind but PB 2
is a great alternative to peanut butter
because it's got no artificial
sweeteners or preservatives and it's
also 85% less fat calories than peanut
butter which is crazy
so all you're going to do is just pour
some of the powder into a little bowl
and mix it in with some water and I
normally do about two parts powder one
part water but you basically just want
to mix it in to the consistency of
melted chocolate now all I'm doing here
is just drizzling at the pb2 onto my
rice cakes and for some reason this
tastes so good guys I definitely
recommend trying it out it basically
tastes like popcorn covered in chocolate
with a kick of peanut butter I don't
know it's just really good so I love
snacking on this during any time of the
date our last dessert idea our homemade
oatmeal cookies and I actually found
this recipe from Blogilates on YouTube
but first off you're going to need some
oats which are great because they're
super high in protein and healthy fats
and they've got great amino acids and
they help you feel fuller so they're
awesome and you're going to need one
banana so you're first going to start
out by taking one cup of oats and
blending it into your blender this is
going to work as the flour for our
cookies next you just want to take your
banana and put it into a medium-sized
bowl and start mashing it with the back
of a fork
once your bananas are all mashed and
gooey you just want to take your oats
pour them in and mix everything up
as you can see here you may have to mix
it with your hands but that is how you
create the dough it is so fast and easy
and once you are done with that you just
want to place your cookies onto a cookie
sheet I made about four medium sized
cookies with this measurement for the
sake of the video I decided to make
these plain but I definitely recommend
adding in some craisins or raisins or
even dark chocolate chips
I definitely think they taste better
when you add something inside of them
but after that you just want to place
them in the oven for 350 degrees for
about 15 to 20 minutes or until they
turn a golden brown you can definitely
add some baking soda to help your
cookies rise a little bit more but once
they have completely cooled I'm just
transferring them over to a separate
plate and that is how you create your
oatmeal banana cookies that is it for
today's video I hope you guys enjoyed it
be sure to give it a big thumbs up if
you guys want me to create more cooking
videos and I'll see you guys later bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
