going to be beauty related at all and
I'm sorry about that but yeah if you
don't want to watch this video I don't
really care you can go you know exit out
or something like that cuz i'm just
going to be talking this entire video so
it's got to be kind of like a vlog but
yeah i decided to make a vlog on this
channel today just because I feel like I
kind of owe you guys this video and kind
of tell you guys what's going on and you
know things that have maybe happen
recently or whatever I don't really know
just because I haven't really been
making many videos lately and it kind of
sucks but yeah that's why I'm here today
to tell you guys what's going on and you
know kind of catch up with you guys and
you know here how you guys are doing and
stuff so yeah the reason why I haven't
really been making videos with in the
past like two and a half weeks is
because I'm in my schools like tennis
team and yeah shocker totally surprised
that i made the tennis team but somehow
i did because i'm really not that good
but i did make it and being on the high
school tennis team is kind of like a
what's it called it's like a big
responsibility just because we have
practice every single day monday through
friday we have it for like two hours and
40 minutes or something like that and
then on weekends will have mattress and
games and stuff like that so lately my
schedule has been kind of like hectic
and crazy and I absolutely never have
any time to make videos during the
weekdays just because when I come home
with tennis it's already like six
o'clock and then I have to go take a
shower cuz I'm like all sweaty and gross
and I still to eat dinner and do my
homework and stuff and I feel like if
it's like eight o'clock and I come home
I just took a shower I don't want to put
makeup all over again and get ready for
another video when I'm going to go to
bed in like two hours you know I'm
saying so I can't really right now I
can't really make videos during the
weekdays because I don't really have any
time and stuff like that but yeah my
schedules with crazy
I'm so sorry because I know that I had
made video a while I feel bad yeah so
that is kind of the reason that I
haven't really been making that much
videos and I'm sorry but you guys are
kind of going to have to stick with this
for like another month or something but
once the tennis season is over I'm going
to be back to making regular videos on a
regular day basis because then I'm going
to finally be able to make videos after
school during the weekdays and stuff
like that but right now I really just
don't have any time to do any of it and
kind of sucks because you know I'm
trying to juggle tennis in school and
YouTube and it's just it's crazy so yeah
enough about that you guys understand
now let's see anything say oh ok I
wanted to ask you guys this favor
surveys for there's website called king
of web com where it's kind of like you
sign up in people vote and you see like
who's going to be like the king of the
web like every month I'm not really sure

called but I signed up for like the
beauty kind of category and so you can

become king or queen of the web or
whatever and um I don't know it's really
