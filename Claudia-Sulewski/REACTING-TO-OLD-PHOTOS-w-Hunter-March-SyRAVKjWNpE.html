today we are going to be reacting to old
photos and possibly a video at the end
if you're lucky and I'm also actually
kind of sorry I was a jerk the other day
when you invited me to join Team 4 you
pebbles so I brought you these
Hunter oh my gosh could be honest though
we might have another crunch after I
react to some of these old photos let's
get started with these photos so here we
have the first photo when I was younger
my brother and I played barbershop where
it's cut each other's bigger can you
show me a photo of you and not your
brother I think I would rather have that
than the egghead bye guys so we've got
this one is that a butterfly top that
was actually a dress and is one of my
favorites it appears to me that we kind
of went through a similar hair phase at
one point kind of rock in the middle
part how many of my photos do you have
but I didn't even give you that one you
keep showing these photos I promise you
I will get my revenge so let's move on
from the butterfly to the other fully
like a no idea what that animal is it's
a poodle it kind of looks like it's a
giant bunny right now that was really
painful that was not a fake reaction
okay next up this one oh there's no way
you can make fun of this one oh the boy
is back ever wore black nail polish like
you're like how much off this black nail
polish in a really natural way
and here's another hunter March photo
trying to look super fierce I'm getting
pretty tired of this right now this is
supposed to be all your photos you know
what keep going keep it up
watch it happens this photo would
definitely top my entire hmm actually

super funny all right
