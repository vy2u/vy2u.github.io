first off my doors right here so it just
has like a Marilyn Monroe poster so when
you walk in this is what you see so this
is kind of like an overview my room is
kind of small I don't know it's like
medium sized I guess so
looks like that and then when you turn
the corner over here on the right side
you have my closets in my bathroom so
yeah okay so first off I just want to
mention this one thing before you guys
ask in the comments below I have no idea
where you can buy my furniture like my
bed and that table and the desk and this
whatever wardrobe thing I have no idea
where you can get it just because I've
had these furniture ever since I was
like a baby so my mom just kind of
painted them white so that they would
match my room and I think she got them
at some like antique place or flea
market or something I don't know but
everything in my room is basically like
antiques just like painted white and
yeah so I'm sorry I don't know where you
can get it but basically everything is
like antiques like these little picture
frames and the columns and everything so
yeah and also I'm just going to show you
guys quickly my lighting just because I
feel like it's definitely one of the
most unique things about my room so
first off I just have two lamps so one
over there and one over here they're
both from Target and then I also have a
chandelier which you can see only like
three lightbulbs are actually working
what does the total fail but whatever
yeah it's just like a white slash silver
 sandal ah sit oh my god I cannot
talk chandelier and also what's kind of
cool is if you see that I have like
lighting going around my room with like
this trim or whatever you want to call
it I don't know my dad built it and I
think it looks really awesome so I
always turn it on like during night time
and then the last letting I have is just
for my closet
so yeah let's actually get into it now
so starting off on the left side when
you walk in my door first thing you see
is this big white mirror that my mom
painted and obviously I use this every
day to like see my outfit and stuff so
there I am it looks like that and then
next to it I just have a full
or lamp from Target and then underneath
there I just have my everyday school
backpack which is the Burley's North
Face backpack I think and then when you
go over here I have kind of like this
little wall area with my cork board on
it and I actually painted the frame and
then I just put like chandelier
wallpaper over it just to match my room
and then I just have some pictures a
Tiffany bag and the letter C so yeah and
then also the trim or whatever you want
to call it in my room kind of like stops
right there and then I can have curtains
sorry I don't know why it son focusing
and then I just have these little like
string curtains and I have no idea where
my mom got those but I've had them like
forever so I don't know I kind of like
them I might change them I don't know
and then underneath there I just have my
bed which looks like this I don't know
if I want to keep the same like blanket
I think I'm just going to get like a
white cover to put over this because I
don't really like this pattern but like
for now I don't really care and above my
batter whatever on my bed I just have my
computer just because I'm basically
always on my computer when I'm in my
room so I don't really have special
spots so I just put on my bed and the
little laptop cover is like underneath
it so basically I just have this really
fuzzy black blanket from home goods I
think and then I have this blanket from
I have no idea
black pillow another pillow a nap is in
my future pillow I have a light blue one
and then the black one that I sleep on
so that's my bed and right above it I
just have picture frame and I have a
picture that was drawn of me in like
2007 so that's why I look like a little
kid right there and over next to my bed
I have this old little table which
actually is a sewing machine table like
if you open this up you see there's a
crack it like opens up and there's a
sewing machine in it so it's like a
hundred pounds no joke but yeah I don't
use it obviously I just use it as a
table so I just have this long window
here and the string curtains again and
then over here I just have a blue
whiteboard with like
notes or whatever and then I just have
this silver metal picture frame with the
wrapping paper in it and then I have
this white table you can see it's kind
of like old and chipping and then
underneath here I have this little like
fabric II like Swedish I don't know what
you would call this but it's like a
little storage cube and I just got this
from Target and it was like 15 dollars
and I freaking love this thing because
basically I just store all my curling
irons and hair sprays and hair brushes
and all that stuff in here so I just
kind of throw it in there and when I do
my hair and stuff like that so it's kind
of perfect you know yeah and then over
here in this corner I have my makeup
collection thingamabob err and I also
keep other stuff in here too like
honestly I don't have that much makeup
but yeah that's basically my makeup
thing but I will definitely make a
makeup collection video so yeah I'm not
going to do that right now just to save
some time and then above that I just
have this sorry I'm like so out of
breath right now I don't know why okay
um so above it I just have a desk lamp
from Target which is like the same one
as the floor lamp and that above here I
have another picture john of me from San
Diego in California and this was in like
2009 I believe I'm not really sure so
yeah and then over here on this wall
whoops okay you can see this is my desk
and I don't really use my desk that
often except for like doing my makeup I
guess I don't know I'm usually on my bed
so yeah and I don't know where my desk
is from like I said before but next to
my desks I have these two like columns
which my mom painted and then there's
like little pot things on top I don't
really know but it looks cute and then I
have the little string curtains again
and then also I have paper curtains yeah
I've had them ever since I've like lived
here which is like since kindergarten
but I'm not really net any rush to like
get curtains I don't really care that
much so whatever but I'll definitely get
curtains at some point I hope I don't
know okay so now let's get into my desk
first of all this chair is from
pbteen calm or just pbteen I don't know
but yeah it doesn't really match to my
room but whatever I don't know I like it
okay so above my bed I have this little
folder holder thing and I got this from
TJ Maxx and I just have notebooks and
papers and magazines and whatever and
then I have this little black pot thing
that used to be a candle and I just keep
my coins in there and then I have this I
home which is white it's like really old
a friend of mine gave it to me and it
hardly works but whatever you know it's
still pretty good and then over here I
have like my little makeup corner I
guess so I have this little glass thing
and then my face brushes here and my eye
makeup brushes here and then I have this
mini little mirror that I use every
single day so now to get into the little
drawers obviously you can see that these
things are falling off and I'm Way too
lazy to screw them back on so I just
have a piece of tape right here
so this is the first drawer it just has
obviously a bunch of pens and pencils I
don't know kind of self-explanatory so
yeah and then this drawer is basically
like my junk drawer it just has like
random things in it books and whatever I
mean obviously everybody has junk
drawers in their room so I didn't really
clean this one out I just kind of throw
whatever I want in there when I don't
feel like cleaning I guess I don't know
and then in this middle drawer right
here I don't really use it I don't
really use this desk like in the inside
but I just have a huge packet of all my
maths notes from last year to help me up
this year I have red tissue paper I
don't know why and then I just have
extra folders and just like extra paper
for math and like all that good stuff so
yeah nothing really in this little
folder thing or whoa drawer and then
over here once again I have the classic
tape trick right here and this is
another like school drawer and I just
have like whiteout and glue and scissors
and paper clips and all that good stuff
so yeah and then in this drawer I have
nothing basically
I just have my wireless keyboard and
then I have this empty box that doesn't
even have anything in it and I feel like
I'm going to use it at some point but
yeah so I'm just keeping it in there so
that is it for my little desk area so
next to that is the jewelry armoire that
I finally got you guys know that I've
bought this that I've wanted this for
like a year and a half so I finally
bought it for myself and it looks like
this so at the top I have this little
hard glass thing that I actually painted
like at a birthday party one time and I
just keep like safety pins and tacks for
my cork board and then when you open
this up let me just say okay I store my
Julie in here and kind of like hair
accessories and sunglasses and so yeah
it's kind of like Julie / accessories
and also let me just say I barely have
any Julie but you know you got to start
with something so yeah don't Mike let me
so you open this up and has a mirror I
absolutely am in love with this I just
got it yesterday so over here I have all
my earrings I mean the ones that like I
like the most and I use the most so I
know this is supposed to carry like
rings and stuff but I just put my studs
in here and then I just have like dangly
earrings here I'm sorry I'm so out of
breath this is really annoying me okay
so then there's like two doors that you
open up and by the way this Julie
armoire is from Pier one Imports so it
looks like that it's pretty BA if you
ask me I don't know so first off I just
have a couple of necklaces hanging down
here I love this one some turquoise ones
most of these I like forever21 like
they're really cheap like five dollar
necklaces like feathers and chunky long
necklaces and then here are some shorter
ones I've liked my little Tiffany
necklace and Tiffany bracelet and then
just random little necklaces that I
don't really wear but I just kind of
keep it on there to make it more cute
and then over here I my first drawer
which has all my rings yeah buddy I have
like 10 which is really embarrassing but
you know I don't know I'm definitely
gonna like start buy more but yeah so
there's like my like ten rings that I
have that I own and then in the second
drawer this is actually empty because I
don't know what I want to use it for
maybe like more earrings once my
collection kind of expands utterly no
and then in this next door it's a little
deeper so I keep all my bangles and
bracelets and whatever they're mostly
from like forever 21 and stuff and yeah
I don't know so it's all kind of jumbled
in there looks messy but it's not that
bad I don't know and then in this next
slide I just have all my glasses
I mean sunglasses and then the last one
in here I just have hair accessories so
I've bobby pins hair ties all that good
stuff hair elastics and I have the
little like fabric headbands and then
regular headbands and clips and whatever
is so yeah and then you just close this
up and then down here are two extra
drawers and these are basically like my
electronic drawers so the first one I
just have everything from my camera so
my little leg Joe be um what's it called
what is a tripod and then I have all my
little cords and cables for my cameras
and then obviously my camera goes in
here the one I'm using right now and
then also I just got this one I'm so
excited to use this for like vlogging
and stuff so I have that in there and
then in this last drawer I just have
random stuff like foam cases and hard
drives and little remotes and earbuds
and stuff like that so that's it for in
there oh well this goes on top
Oh also let me just mention right now
about my carpet because I feel like I'm
gonna get a lot of questions on this I
got this carpet from Target actually
bought it online and it was probably the
number one most regret that I've ever
had this carpet is seriously a pain in
the butt because it sheds so much you
sit on it your butt is completely
covered in fur I honestly hate it so
much but I think it's really pretty I
saw a vacuum today so you can't see dust
everywhere and like fur but yeah I
definitely don't buy this rug but I
don't know it's cute so I'm going to
keep it for a little bit I guess I'll
just have to deal with it because you
know it's really cute so yeah okay so
next to my little gieux Lamarr I have
this big wardrobe thing so on this lower
drawer I have all of my nail polishes
and stuff like that and I absolutely
love having my nail polishes in here
just because I feel like this is like
the perfect little area and I didn't
really clean this out too much because
this is always going to be my messiest
chore so I've all my nail polishes here
and me and my mom like share them all so
this is like me and my mom's stuff and
then I just have like tools and then
random lotions and stuff I don't know um
so that's not really that clean but what
else ok so then obviously I have this
mirror here and then when you open this
up this is different from all my old
subscribers that saw my room before this
was all like had books and like toys and
stuff in it yeah so this obviously
changed so now I use this as like an
extra closet so down here I just have
all my hoodies and stuff like that then
up here I have all my zip up sweatshirts
like juicy or Victoria's Secret or ever
commie or whatever and then above it I
have all my sweatpants and yoga pants
and stuff like that and then over here I
have like those sleeveless shirts and
then I also have just regular tank tops
are not tank tops t-shirts that I never
basically where I don't know I sometimes
wear them but I don't really wear these
just because they're kind of cheesy and
stuff they're like the ones from
Victoria's Secret and whatever I don't
not it I don't really use them so I just
folded them up there and then right
above here I have my
a little laundry basket which is kind of
full right now I didn't finish my
laundry today and then over here like
seriously how perfect is this so there's
like this random little bar that's came
with this thing and I feel like it's the
perfect way to like store extra hangers
so I just have that like that and then
up above that I have this pretty ugly
striped box but inside I keep my blonde
hair extensions from luxy hair so I just
have that above there and that I just
have some hats and yeah that is
basically it and then I for Brees right
there so yeah that's how this looks I
love it I always go through and grab
sweatpants and stuff like that so this
is more of like my kind of casual rice I
say it like more casual clothing and
warmer stuff for like the winter and
stuff and then over here and between my
door and my closet I have this little
like I think this is actually - what's
it called - store like men's suits like
the pants and the jackets and the
watches but yeah this was like
originally gold and my dad actually
spray-painted it for me to be black and
I absolutely love it so I just keep my
phone up here as charge it because
there's an outlet right there and then I
just have this white scarf with this
little like diamond like belt thing I
don't know it looks cute so I just leave
that there and then obviously I just
have my light switches and then above
that I have this empty frame which I
actually like having it empty I don't
know why but it's also just an antique
and my dad spray-painted it for me
so now over here is my little closet
area so up above I just have little
paintings that I painted when I was
younger or recently or whatever so I'm
that one that says love this one's
really old but it's just like flowers
empty wall and then I have that one too
I don't know I just have it in there so
it's like my little like painting area I
don't know okay so first we're going to
start out with the closet on the left
side
so it looks like this I think I got all
of my organizational like racks and
stuff from the Container Store
I'm not sure though but I am actually
pretty sure yeah and so on this store I
just have this little like rink hangar
thingamabob ER and I just fold all of my
belts on it I feel like it's very
convenient and I just love it so up
there I just have fuzzy socks and
leggings and boxes I guess I don't
really use that and then I have this
little white band and I keep all of my
bathing suits up there and then right
there I have all my nutty's so those are
sweatshirts that don't have hoodies and
then over here I have just like two
pairs of shoes that I recently got so
I'm just keeping them in a box I can
show you guys them so these are from
Roxy they're like these adorable little
like watch boobies I don't know they're
so cute but yeah and then those are just
like black high heels from Charlotte
Russe I'm kind of too lazy to open that
so I'm just going to leave it so
underneath are all of my shorts and I am
a very big shorts girl so I have a lot
of shorts and I think I still have some
more in the laundry too so over here I
like my colored ones and then over here
I have some white ones and some beige
ones and jean ones and more jean ones
and over here I have all my Sophie's or
Sophie's or whatever you want to call
them a skirt for tennis and then back
there I have more kind of shoved in
there so yeah those are my shorts and
down here I have all my jean skirts I
used to love wearing jean skirts but
never really wear them anymore I don't
know so I have those there and then I
just fold all my jeans here just because
they're really easy to like reach for
you know so it's good so then I have
this little like bin thing with drawers
and at the top I don't really keep
anything here I just have like this will
whatever measuring thing because I
always shop online and then I just have
these line of dogs I don't really know
so the first one is just like bras and
socks and all that good stuff the second
one is pajamas and the third one is just
like leggings I don't really know if you
want to see it
not really that interesting at all and
then to the right of that I have this
little teeny bar of rack or rack or
whatever and I just have all my skirts
hanging down here so I like high-waisted
skirts and pencil skirts and whatever so
yeah that is it for this first drawer I
also have a little hook here but I
really have anything hanging at the
moment then I have this little closet
door on the right side and this one's
kind of crazy okay that door is really
hard to open okay so first I must start
at the top I just have random boxes and
bags don't really go through that stuff
then over here I have obviously all my
tank tops I try to color coordinate them
throw like black and then gray and then
white and then purple and then blue and
then green and the yellow in red but it
didn't really work that well I don't
really know but I'm a huge like tank top
type of girls so I have a lot of those
and then over here I'd like more fancier
kind of short sleeve shirts that aren't
in my wardrobe thing and then I also
have some long-sleeve shirts and plaid
shirts and yeah and then underneath
there I have more fancier clothes so I
have a lot of dresses here and crop tops
and like crochet shirts and I don't know
why this isn't in there but whatever and
then yeah so it's kind of like fancier
like blouses and dresses and stuff like
that so I just have that there and then
I have this little hanging shoe rack
thingamabob and I just have some wedges
that were my mom's and some flats and
flip-flops and sneakers utterly no most
of my shoes are downstairs I don't
really keep that money shoes up here but
yeah this store doesn't really have
anything on it but this store I am
obsessed with okay so I just ordered
this thing not a while ago and it's
called my pear tree and it's basically a
flip-flop organizer how smart is that so
I got a pink one to match the walls my
closet obviously and I just keep all of
my pretty and fancier sandals on here
and you can hold six
two-six so love that it's seriously such
a nice way to organize all my flip-flops
my gosh my camera is like getting really
really hot okay so in between my two
closets I have my own bathroom which I'm
so fortunate about I love it because I
have two older brothers and their
bathroom is disgusting oh my gosh like
Oh hallelujah that I have my own
bathroom so yeah I just have a mini
little chandelier up there and then I
also have two lights that hang here but
only one of them is working of course
so my bathroom is really really tiny but
I don't know I love it so this is my
little countertop and my mom like
actually got like a painter over here to
hand paint this also this was hand
painted and it's absolutely beautiful
I love it so much and then I just have
like stone counters and it's really
pretty like white sink and I just have
bamboo that I've been growing for like
seven years and I have this huge circle
mirror and then I just have a little
frame thing up there and then also I
have this big glass kind of jar thing
with shells in it this was originally my
brother's bathroom but I had to steal it
because I think it's really pretty so I
don't know I like it and then I have a
hook there that I usually have like a
mini towel for my face but I don't
really have that at the moment so yeah
now I'm going to get into what's in here
and it's really boring so nothing really
that's special here I just have like
whatever no cleaning supplies all that
then I have toothbrushes razors and
deodorant a container for like my
toothbrush and then this one's empty so
yeah
nothing really special and then also I
have this one basket underneath and I
have no idea what to put in here so
comment below if you know it's a put in
here like laundry or extra towels or I
don't really know and then I just have
this little blue carpet and I love the
flooring in here it's like tile like
stone
I don't know I like it and then on this
side I had my toilet and I just carry or
not carry but I placed all of my
fragrances and body splashes and
perfumes on top of my toilet and then
over here I have a mirror I have a lot
of mirrors if you guys haven't noticed
so this little hook thing out of my two
fuzzy robes and then I have a little
thing for twit paper and then I have
another mirror would you look at that
and then I have this white curtain
shower thing it has like lace on it
which is really pretty
and then I have another mirror yeah and
then I just have a bunch of towels
sitting up there and then this is kind
of like my little shower like holder and
it has like little baby angels and I
think it's really cute it's like stone
and yeah pretty self-explanatory and
this is my little like shower caddy or
what everyone call it I have like my
deep repair mask and my shampoos and all
that good stuff I keep it in here just
because basically my family always uses
my stuff and it drives me crazy so after
this video I'm going to go hide this
somewhere so that my brother or my mom
or whatever
don't use my stuff because yeah my
brother uses my shampoo it's really
annoying
then also the walls are like blue but
then they have like brown streaks going
on them or a waterfall I don't know but
my mom painted it and I think it's
really pretty so thanks mom I like a lot
and that kind of sounded sarcastic but
that was it and then also I our like
house has little diamond like what's it
called doorknobs which are really pretty
so I don't know I like that and oh my
gosh that's oh wait one more thing okay
so underneath my bed I have two little
Rolly bins things that I keep my purses
in because you guys are probably like
Claudia where are your purses so this is
the first one whatever kind of big and I
just have some purses and then here's
the second one
which has more purses that I use
often so I have like satchels and bags
from like forever 21 and stuff like that
and yeah that is basically it for I
always say the word basically I'm sorry
so that is it from my room tour I hope
you guys enjoyed it and I will talk to
you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
