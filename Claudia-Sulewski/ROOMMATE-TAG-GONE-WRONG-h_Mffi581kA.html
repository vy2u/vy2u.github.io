children screaming that are screaming
everywhere like for the bloody murder
today we're gonna be doing the
long-awaited roommate Sam if you're
gonna answer all those frequently asked
questions that you love to know about us
rooming together Lexi and I looked over
the questions on the actual roommate tag
that goes around YouTube and the
questions were kind of lame-o we decided
to pull out our favorite ones and
incorporate those first in our videos
then we're gonna do a little twist and
ask our own questions with each other
and turn ourselves into pancakes one
wise first question what is one thing
that really bothers you about your
roommates wait wait there's nothing what
you're talking about every single cup of
water that I put anywhere besides my
room this girl will take an automatic
and make its work if you have like those
little mason cups with the straws and
stuff and I was purposely tell her I'm
like Lexi today I am going to have the
blue straw yours is the biggest drop an
hour later I see her walk around sipping
with the blue straw like
I told you it's just like any cup she's
like it this is fine it's over true my
pet peeve very limited by temperature is
never on point
nobody's cold I'm so cold and Connie is
always hot mi was very and so she comes
in to say oh it's so high over here
let's put on your cool air you lately
like we've just been leaving the
apartment neutral no and no one wins
it's so cool not though question number
two what is one Roland you guys have
while living together remember do you
use your room it's things without asking
before we decided to make the
life-changing switch of sharing utensils
I definitely used to steal your utensils
when I were dirty well is this something
I don't know I don't know the better
twenty to support the one time
claudia was on a trip and i was just
after a lie and we're hanging out
there's this jacket of Claudia's no it's
so good with my outfit it had like
floral sleeves I was trying to justify
to them I was like I don't really take
things like without asking but I'm
thinking like it should be okay I wore
it anyway I the decision was made I did
it I worked in Starbucks like a couple
blocks away
temporary was my champion you remember
we went shopping so I called it the last
order in which is American Apparel and
the ladies never talk but again
like that says but the truth comes out
when the cameras turn off camera for
this next portion of today's video lexi
is going to be asking me questions about
her and we're going to see if I would go
to roommates and if she's not I get to
turn her into a pancake what do you mean
by them what do I mean you ask it just
means that the ingredients that normally
you use to make a pancake which are
water egg flour layer of medieval syrup
and butter and put them on our face yes
I'm gonna start off easy all right okay
what is my current favorite snacks last
meal okay there's like a lot of things
that you eat
currently you've been eating potatoes a
lot simple potatoes oh hold on pull that
hold up banana ice cream oh my you're
too late I'm sorry Claudia salute wow
you really are first ingredient on you
what is the kind of music that I would
say is my guilty pleasure would it be
like the music that you play yourself
with that rap music and stuff mm-hmm
like that what is the name of okay I
know the county

somewhat not on that right who is my
first

final question what was the date that I
moved here this is I don't want to turn
