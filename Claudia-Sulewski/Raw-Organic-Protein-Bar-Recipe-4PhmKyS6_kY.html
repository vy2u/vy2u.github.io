main ingredients so first off you'll
need for organic dates which have a very
sticky consistency to help all the
ingredients stick together and they also
have a lot of health benefits to them
next stop you'll be needing some
chocolate flavored protein powder I take
one scoop or 20 grams of the perfect fit
plant-based protein which tastes so good
I'm starting out by cutting my dates in
half and taking out the seeds because
you do not want to be blending them in
this recipe
so I'm just throwing in my four dates
and a scoop of the perfect fit protein
powder into my blender today I'm going
to be using my nutribullet to blend my
ingredients and you want to keep
blending until they become a one uniform
substance
now it is time for the extra ingredients
to give your protein bars a little bit
of flavor and texture to them so I love
adding in oats as well as chia seeds for
that Omega 3 any nuts or almonds and
really any type of seeds to add that
extra crunch and cacao powder and PB to
give a great flavor to your protein bars
as well today I'm going to be adding in
a scoop of oats as well as two
tablespoons of chia seeds and some flax
seeds for that fiber lastly I'm adding
in some pb2 to give a peanut butter
taste to my bark and once again you're
just going to blend everything up until
it's completely combined
once you finish with that just roll out
some wax paper and dump your ingredients
on there to start molding your protein
bar in whatever shape you want you can
do a cookie shape or a rectangle like I
did today you can also store your
protein bar in the wax paper and put it
in the fridge or eat it right away and
this far lasts for a few days but I like
eating it right away when it's most
chewy so that is how you create the raw
organic super easy and super healthy
protein bar be sure to like this video
for more cooking videos and I'll see you
guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
