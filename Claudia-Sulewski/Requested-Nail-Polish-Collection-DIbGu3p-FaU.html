polish stuff in this little lower drawer
in my big wardrobe thing so yeah I think
about everything for nails is in here so
when I open it up who looks like that
and I like keeping my nap Pasha's here
because number one you're not supposed
to key from in your bathroom I've heard
because of like the humidity and staff
and also you don't want to store your
nail polishes on the side you want to
keep them up and this is like the best
place that I can fit all of my nail
polishes I've had many other ways but
since I got a couple more they haven't
been like fitting so this is the best
way that I found to store them and I
actually like it because everything is
kind of together so I'm going to start
right here so in the back over here I
just have like the China Glaze boxes i
don't know i always keep boxes I don't
even know why but I have those in the
back then I have this little divider
thing and in here I have the little Bowl
that you guys know I always used for my
tutorials I've got toothpicks and I've
got a sponge here I've got all my tools
like nail clippers and kyouko pushers
and stuff then here I just have some
nail filers like short study ones then
here I've got some hand lotions from
Bath and Body Works and victoria secret
and over here I've got my favorite nail
polish remover and it's like lemon
scented so it doesn't like smell like
alcohol it's not really nasty smell I've
got some longer nail filers right there
so that's it for this little divider
section then I've got this little wipe
in and this just has all my little
cotton swabs or balls and stuff like
that so I've got the big chubby ones the
little ones and still like sheet ones
and I use these obviously to clean off
my nail polish and I actually keep my
extras over in
my makeup cart and the second to last
bin I keep like all my extra ones so
yeah so now on to my nail polishes
they're all right here kind of jumbled
up no special order so i'm going to show
you guys all the nail polishes that i
have by the brand so these are my china
glaze nail polishes so i have secret
periwinkle I've got refreshment which is
actually what's on my nails right now
wagon trail I think this is recycle yeah

fancy so those are all of my tran glaze
nail polishes so these are my OPI nail
polishes and I've only got four so
that's kind of sad but um yeah so I've

stuff to use as like a base or top coat
so yeah those are all of my sally hansen
purview perfumes oh my gosh nail
polishes next i have on my wet and wild
nail polishes so this one is true love
don't know what these three are but
that's just a simple black white and
like a turquoise color donut this is
either this is like a sparkly silver
color this is Caribbean frost and this

and my savanna nail polishes next up
I've got my Essie nail polishes and some
L'Oreal ones so this one is like lilac
ISM or something like that this one is
my way this is pan ce pas sy so those
are the SC nail polishes that I have
then for l'oreal i've got this one which
is Chiclets this one is mango get'em and
this is hardcore so yeah those are my
L'Oreal and Essie nail polishes so these
are the last of my nail polishes and
this is where it gets really really
random and they're all just different
brands and companies so the first three

and it's from Isadora then I have an NYC
nail polish which I've no idea what the
color is it doesn't say this is by
heaven and that one's just a black it
doesn't say this one I'm not even sure a
company it is but it's just like a
really pretty turquoise color then I've
got a modern purple by Santi and then
I've got this I've no idea how to
pronounce that but it's like a base and
top
and it's actually good because I just
got it so those are the last of my nail
polishes and once again it's all just
random brands so that is it for my nail
polish collection and kind of nail tools
collection so maybe in a couple of
months once I get some more i'll make an
update and nail polish collection but
for now this is all I've got so I'll see
