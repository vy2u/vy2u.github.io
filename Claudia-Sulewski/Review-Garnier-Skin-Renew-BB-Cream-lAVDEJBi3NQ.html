a product review for you and I haven't
done one of these videos in a very long
time so I'm actually really excited to
do this and also I apologize in advance
for the lighting it's probably gonna get
darker since it gets dark um like really
fast because it's like almost seven
o'clock so yeah I apologize for that but
it is a review so it doesn't really
matter too much about the color and the
lighting and stuff but yeah I have
nothing else to say I'm just going to
get right into it so the product i'm
going to be reviewing is the Garnier BB
cream and this is the box that comes in
I saved it just to show you guys I don't
know and then this is the actual product
itself so it comes in a tube with a
little squeezy cap I don't know what
you'd call it but looks like this so
yeah this product has SPF 15 and also it
has two point five fluid ounces or 75
milliliters which is actually a lot of
products like this whole thing has
really filled up so this will last me a
very very long time one of the bad
things about this product is that it
only comes in two different shades so
you obviously don't have a very wide
selection of different colors I am the
lighter shade which is called light
medium and then obviously there's a
darker one I don't know the name of that
but there's just two different shades
and this one actually fits me perfectly
so it doesn't bother me but I don't know
it just is kind of weird how they only
come in two different shades but i'm
going to give you guys a quick swatch of
it just so you can kind of see like the
color and the consistency of it and
stuff so it looks like that and it's
really smooth and creamy so looks like
that and yeah so the first thing i
noticed about this when i used it the
first time is the smell it has a very
very strong smell so if you don't like
makeup that has strong smells you might
not like this and this might not be best
for you but in my opinion it doesn't
bother me because it's kind of more of a
like cleaner smelling smell if you guys
know what I'm saying in my opinion it
smells very similar to Nivea hand cream
or nivea lotion it has that strong smell
so it doesn't really bother me
but I just wanted to tell you guys just
in case if that would bother you hey
wait stop before I get any further with
this review I quickly just want to
mention what a BB cream is because i
just realized probably some of you don't
know what that is um so a BB cream is
not a foundation but it's not a tinted
moisturizer it's kind of in between so
now I'm just going to read off and tell
you guys what the box says BB cream is
it says it's a hybrid formula that
offers advanced skincare an immediate
skin perfecting coverage that is
becoming popular all over the world it
combines several beauty routine steps in
one single step and also BB cream stands
for beauty balm cream just in case you
guys are wondering so now let's get back
to the review as for coverage this
product has very very very very very
very light coverage take my word for it
is very light this stuff will not cover
any pimples or acne or anything like
that it just overall gives your face a
very nice kind of complexion it evens
out your skin tone so if you do have
like discoloration anywhere this will
cover that up and also it is slightly
buildable so I get kind of like red
right here on the upper part of my
cheeks and if I just put two coats of
this then it will you know cover it up
and make it look you know flawless and
stuff so it is great for that but it
will not cover up your acne so this is
more closer to being a tinted
moisturizer than it is as a foundation
so the way that I like to use this
product is I mix it with my current
foundation that I'm using because this
alone doesn't give me enough coverage
that I like to personally have just
because you know i do get acne on my
nose especially right in this area
between my eyebrows on my chin so i do
like to have it just a little bit more
coverage so what I'll do is I'll mix my
foundation and the BB cream kind of 50
50 or maybe a little bit more of this
and the foundation that i'm currently
using is the l'oreal true match super
blendable makeup i love this
foundation so much I'm in n three
national buff and I'm actually starting
to run out as you can see it's like
starting to become empty so have to buy
more of this but um yeah so I mix these
two together I just put some on the top
of my hand and then I just mix it and
then I use my fingers to apply it and
the way that I like to do this is I kind
of pet on my face and then I use like a
dabbing motion to blend it in I don't
really like going like this I don't know
why I like to like dab just personal
preference i guess but um yes so i use
my fingers for this you can use it with
a brush like one of these or stippling
brush or whatever but I just personally
like to use my hands I think it's
easiest and the best way for me um what
else can I say about this as for who I
would recommend this product to it would
definitely be for the people who have
very dry skin I have kind of combination
normal skin I don't know I get like oily
on my nose but the rest of my face is
dry so this works fine for me but this
pot is very very moisturizing so this
pretty much works is like a every day
moisturizer as well but for those people
that have really oily skin i don't think
i would recommend this product just
because it's going to make your face
look really really oily but for me it
just makes my face look really dewy and
just fresh looking and that's the look
that I like to go forward during the
springtime so this is great for anyone
who has normal to dry skin also when you
apply this all over your face you do get
that kind of sticky not really sticky
but that like feeling when you put
lotion on your skin you can kind of feel
like the product on your face you do get
that feeling when you wear this and you
guys know that I hate that feeling
because I talked about that in my like
skin care video or something so I do
have to put like a powder over this to
set it and have that kind of matte
finish and feeling to it because I hate
that feeling on my face so this will
give that feeling on your face if you
guys don't like that then definitely
recommend putting on some translucent
powder or something of that sort so i
think i mentioned pretty much everything
that i want to say about this product
I have not broken out at all by using
this I've been using this product for it
good i think three weeks now and i have
been broken out at all with this and i
haven't had any reactions or anything
like that so overall i recommend this
product to people that have normal to
dry skin and don't need a lot of
coverage maybe just you know it all over
kind of evening out you know your skin
color type of thing and uh dropped it of
course i dropped an eye drop products in
every single video um anyway suppose i'm
going to say that is it for today's
review comment below and tell me if you
guys liked it and I'm sorry I've been
swinging it around or I think I have at
least maybe it was out of the camera but
I've been swinging this thing around
throughout this entire video and I'm
sorry if that bother you but um I just
it's fun I guess I don't know that's it
for today's video and I hope you guys
enjoyed it and that is it bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
