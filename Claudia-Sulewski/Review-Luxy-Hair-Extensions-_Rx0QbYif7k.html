reviewing my luxy hair extensions
because this was very very requested and
I'm sorry that this is the second review
in a row I didn't really plan on having
two reviews kind of at the same time so
I'm sorry that my latest one was also
review so hope you guys can forgive me
for that but yeah so I'm just going to
get right into it because I have a lot
of things to talk about my hair
extensions so before I start out with
actually talking about them I just want
to quickly mention that I did not get
this for free this is I'm not getting
paid for this video or anything like
that you know I got these myself so this
isn't sponsored in any way at all they
don't even know I'm making this video so
I just want to put that out there
for those people that might think that
which is not true so before I actually
show you them I just want to talk a
little bit about their website for those
of you don't want to know about it
basically the website is luxy hair calm
I'll have the link in the downbar I'll
have a bunch of links in the downbar
that I will mention later on in the
video so just check down there for
everything but basically it's just a
website owned by these two gorgeous
sisters and I'm just in love with this
website it's really awesome so now I'm
going to show you guys my hair
extensions okay so they look like this
and these are all of them like smush
together or not so much but like put
together so this is actually a really
thick pointelle especially when you edit
with your hair there's two types of hair
extensions you can get there's the 120
grams and the 160 grams and the
difference between the two is that the
120 just waste less obviously it has one
less piece because there's nine pieces
in this and ten pieces in the 160 so all
that's really different about it is it
weighs less it has one less piece and
there's a little bit less hair in each
clip so there's more hair in the other
one and basically it's for people if
they have really thick or thin hair my
hair is really thin but it's still long
so I just wanted these kind of for a
little bit more volume and just
especially length so I decide to go with
these but if you have really
maybe like shorter hair or something
then definitely get the 160 grams for
those of you wondering which ones I got
which color I got the 120 grams there's
only a $20 difference these were 120 and
those were 140 you guys probably
thinking holy crap those are really
really expensive
and I know they're really expensive but
these are made out of real human hair
it's like ret me human hair or something
which is like the best type of hair you
can get for hair extensions oh also mine
was in dirty blonde I think yes so these
aren't dirty blonde and when I wear the
hair extensions it matches my hair
perfectly because I made a video wearing
these which I'll have the link in the
downbar so you can check out and see how
I look when I actually wear these it's
in my like eyebrows video so it'll just
be down there or I could click up here
or something and it's seriously you
cannot tell they're extensions it looks
like completely 100% in my hair it's so
awesome I'm so happy with this choice
color it matches so well what else do I
have to say so yeah that's really the
difference between the two types you can
get they're all the same length and when
you wear them the longest pieces end up
going to like your bellybutton so that's
how long they are you can't really
choose length wise which is what I like
because other websites there's like
different links and I don't know which
length I would choose so I was happy
that you don't get a choice in with
which length because then it's like you
know you're not like stuck between what
you want to choose so all you really
have to decide between is the colors and
yes this is the dirty blonde one so I
actually bought my mom a set of these
too because I bought these with my own
money by myself and I also bought my mom
the same exact set except I bought it
for her in what is it I think it's dark
brown yeah in dark brown number two
so I actually bought my mom some hair
extensions too it was like her early
Christmas present so I just kind of got
that out of the way so I don't really
know where they are so I'm not really
going to show them to you guys but I got
my mommy's and we both love them so much
they're so soft they're in such good
condition you can basically do
anything with these you can straighten
them you can curl them but he protected
them you actually have to wash them too
if you do that kind of stuff
I have never messed with these they come
stick string i've never straighten it
i've never put any product in it so i
don't have to wash it for a pretty long
time but you know you want to make sure
to take care of them and stuff like that
so also if you guys want to know how to
you know clip them in or how to wash
them or how to take care of them or how
to store that all that stuff if you
actually go on their website they have a
tab that says video and basically it
just has a bunch of videos the two girls
that open the website actually make
videos here on youtube and they have a
bunch of tutorials on using these they
have just everything you need to know
about these so i decided that i'm not
going to do any more videos talking
about this because they seriously cover
everything i'm their youtube channel
which i'll link down there and i'll also
link the page that just has all the
videos on it so yeah i'm not really
gonna be making any tutorials with these
but i'm gonna wear them in videos so i'm
just gonna show you guys what comes in
the 120 pack because you guys are
probably wondering so first off you get
the biggest one which this is a four
piece it looks like this and these are
obviously clipping so they just clip
like that and then what you do is you
kind of just clip onto your hair and
then you snap it shut and they will hold
on all day they don't fall off at all
there's actually like little rubber
pieces on it so it like sticks to your
hair and really grabs it doesn't hurt or
anything like that you can barely feel
them it's really awesome
they're super smooth and you can't see
them at all I don't know I just love it
these are seriously just such good
quality and stuff like that and if you
got the 160 grams they would have two of
these so the one that I have only has
one four piece then it also has two
three pieces so it has three clips as
you can see these all go in the back of
your head but you can watch her video on
how you put them in
then there's two like two clips to two
pieces and then you get four singles
which just has one clip like that so
there's four of those I mean I don't
really know what to say about them I
just love them so much there's so
awesome that feels so real if you guys
are wondering when or where I ever wear
them I don't wear them to school just
because you don't have to go to gym and
it's like I'm not gonna wear it during
school and people are gonna be like yeah
your hair grew long overnight like I
don't know um I just feel like I
wouldn't want to wear them to school
cause like German stuff but you know I
will be wearing them to like Christmas
parties or family parties or if I ever
had like a meet-up or something I'd wear
them out where and when my videos of
course and I don't know I'm just gonna
wear them to more like special events
and stuff like that not to school just
because it kind of be like a pain and a
bother I don't know so as for like me
writing it and if I recommend it I
definitely rate these like ten out of
ten five out of I whatever as I
recommend that 100% definitely out of
all the websites I've seen with hair
extensions this one is definitely my
favorite
obviously I'm a customer from them and I
love it so so much I've never really
tried any other hair extensions so I
can't really compare it to anything else
but compared to my hair these are so
healthy and my hair is like dead so yeah
love that so much I'll have all the
links in the downbar of course oh let me
show you guys how I store them because
you have to store them in some kind of
box or something to keep them protected
and not getting naughty or you know you
don't want dust on them or anything like
that so they recommend putting them in
boxes you can even put in a shoe box if
you don't have one but I just put in
this one this is just some random old
little jewelry box that's kind of ugly
but I just keep it in my wardrobe thing
so it's like material satin inside and I
just put the hair extensions together
and
just like fold them in there close it
and there it's a go and they don't bend
or anything like that they're still
super straight when you put them in here
so that's good so you always want to
keep them make sure you store them the
right way and stuff like that so once
again if you guys want to see me how I
look when I wear them you can just check
out my eyebrows all about my eyebrows
video because I wore them in there and a
lot of you guys noticed that I was
wearing hair extensions in there cuz I
didn't say it
I swore them but they blend in so nicely
with my hair it's actually really there
you can see it it's obviously a little
lighter but when you like put them all
together it just it looks beautiful I
love it
yes so I guess that's really all I want
to talk about just I love okay I love my
hair extensions so much they're so
awesome and soft and I just like can't
stop petting it it's so soft so that is
it for today's review I hope this kind
of somewhat helped you guys out
if you guys are ever wanting to invest
in hair extensions definitely recommend
this brand by far and I think that's
basically it I'm really sure yeah that
basically is it so I love it so much and
I really hope you guys try these out and
I hope that I helped you guys out a
little bit today so I will talk to you
guys in a new video hopefully soon and
that's it alright bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
