a review because I haven't made one in a
really long time and I really miss using
that intro that you guys just saw
because I think it's really cute and in
my September's favorites video one of
the top brightest comments I don't know
if it still is right now but one of the
top like rated comments was asking me to
do a separate video tell you guys sorry
the lighting is just weird telling you
guys my thoughts and feelings about the
macadamia natural oil deep repair mask
so I decided that I would do it because
I even made a review in a long time so
yeah I don't really have anything else
to say so I'm just gonna get right into
it so I'm gonna start with how it looks
so it looks like this and this is the
macadamia natural oil deep repair mask
so obviously it's for your hair looks
like this reminds me of a coconut
someone said that it's supposed to look
like a coconut so I don't know if it is
then they did good cuz it looks like a
coconut and when you open it up just
twist it off and it looks like this it's
just like a little tub of this white
stuff that's what she said so the
texture of this stuff is like kind of
thick and like creamy and this smell
it's like it feels good but it's not
like my favorite smell the whole world
it kind of just smells like any regular
shampoo air conditioner it smells good
but you know it's like not like a scent
that you'll like remember you know what
I'm saying and this is great for those
people that have really damaged hair
either from using like heat products and
having your hair like really dried out
because of all the heat they use or
because you dye your hair like me
obviously I bleached my hair
I use this in the shower so I was like
okay that's not really gonna work but
basically how I use this is first I will
like I'll go to shower and I'll like
shampoo my hair and then I will
condition my hair and then after I've
done that then I'll kind of squeeze out
all the water my hair to the point where
you're like there's like no water left
and I'll take about this much I guess I
don't know about this much of the deeper
pair mask and I'll just kind of run it
through my hair and kind of like work it
in especially on the ends because that's
where my hair is like the driest and you
leave it in your hair for seven minutes
so while you know you're waiting seven
minutes and shower you can like what
shape your legs like Claire and I don't
care what you do on the shower you can
just wait seven minutes and then one
seven minutes is up or around there I
don't know I don't really legit time it
I just kind of like okay I'll take it
out now then you'll just kind of you
know rinse your hair through with water
and your hair feels so smooth and soft
like I can't even explain it's like
heaven it's just so like silky and soft
and that's really how you use it you
just put it in like any conditioner and
just leave it in so it's not really hard
to use at all
they I think they recommend using it two
to three times a week because it is a
really really like powerful products
like if you use it every single day your
hair will Populi end up being really
greasy and if you have really thin hair
it'll really like weigh your hair down
so you don't want to use it like every
day but I don't know if you have like
really thick hair you can use it every
other time you wash your hair I kind of
use it like every other other time or
sometimes every other time I don't know
I love this stuff though so this stuff
lasts a long time I mean okay it's kind
of tipping out but obviously there's a
lot of product in here it definitely
like made a difference in my hair so
much by like how smooth it is and stuff
like that because my hair was so damaged
to the point where if I brush it out it
was constantly knots in it it wasn't
soft it was like I could I like felt the
dryness in my hair I just I knew it like
when I got my hair cut you know the lady
was like your hair is like really
damaged I was like yeah I know but this
stuff definitely changed my hair you
know I'm gonna be using this a couple
more times and then I'm gonna dye my
hair again so I'm gonna wait so my hair
kind of gets back to it's more original
stage of being healthy with this stuff
and yeah so this stuff has eight point
five fluid ounces in if you guys want to
know that
it's like $30 or $36 I'm not sure I
should have checked before this video
but I kind of forgot so it's around 30
bucks which is kind of expensive in my
opinion for a hair product but it is so
worth it like I'm not even kidding you I
totally like understand why's 30 bucks
because it works so so well I also
really want to try out their shampoo and
conditioners so can you guys comment
below for all the people let's try the
shampoo conditioner tell me if it's good
as well because I'm trying to find a
shampoo I'm gonna share but I haven't
really found my favorite one yet so for
all that for all you guys that like try
it out this companies you know shampoo
and conditioner then please cut it below
and tell me if you liked it cuz I will
definitely want to try it out since I
love this product so much so I guess
that's really all that I have to say 5
out of 5 stars definitely recommend it
to everyone you know even if you don't
damage your hair or do anything at me
damaging to your hair you know the ends
of your hair still dry out after like a
period of time so it's nice to kind of
give them some moisturization that's not
even a word is it once in a while so yes
love this thing so so so so much you can
get it alta you can get it targeted I
don't know I ordered mine off old sitcom
I don't know but yes I love it so much
so I'm definitely want to try other
things from this company and I don't
want to make this review too long so I'm
going to just go and I won't talk to you
either okay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
