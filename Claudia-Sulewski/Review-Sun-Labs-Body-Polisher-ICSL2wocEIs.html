a product view and I'm really excited
for this one because there's a couple
things that I want to talk about and you
know I'm just excited to review about
them stuff and I don't really have
anything else to say in this intro so
I'm just kind of I'm just going to kind
of go right into it um so basically you
guys know that I really love the company
sun labs because a while back I got
their little like tanning lotion and
like a little exfoliator thing and like
a tan maintainer and stuff and legit I
use this all freaking time like I used
it on my face this morning so that's why
I kind of left and right now and it is
so sad because I'm about down to here I
mean you can't see it but I can see it
like threw the bottle I'm like down here
which is really sad so I'm definitely
gonna have to pick up more definitely
like my favorite tanning lotion ever
ever ever ever um so basically kind of
more earlier and the sour kind of a
while back you sent me this other
product that was really cool and I want
to share with you guys today and
basically what it is is I always do that
is it is a it's a body posture and soft
tan remover which is great because
sometimes if you put on too much Tang
ocean like on your leg or something and
you'll accidentally like miss a spot or
something or too much as in one area it
can be hard to get it off something's
definitely in my eye right now that
hurts um it's like sometimes it's really
really hard to scrub off or wash off and
stuff and obviously you don't want to
walk around with like orange you know
spots in your legs or anything like that
so I'm basically the website created
this little um thing a majig I'm just
going to show you guys it right now
makes this little products are here and
it's like a body polisher and it comes
with one two three four different heads
and it's really really cool so basically
registered nurses it comes in this box
right here
so it's a body posture and self tanner
member so looks like that um and then
basically I think you just need double a
batteries in here I'm highly sure I
can't really I seriously just dropped
all the batteries this is embarrassing
let me just pick them up so basically
all you just need is just four double A
batteries like this and you stack them
in there and it's really really easy to
use let me just close it okay there's
just an on and off button right there
and as you can see the little thing spin
and then you turn it off so it's really
easy to use and I really like it and so
now i'm going to show you guys the
different heads and like what you use
them for and stuff like that so this is
the main one and it's pretty big this is
the one that used on your body to remove
any tan streaks or anything like that on
your legs or anything like that so um
this is how big it is it's actually
pretty soft and I like it um I'm
basically what you do is you just attach
it on and it's really easy to put on and
it's just start spinning like that so I
just I don't know I love it um and
basically on the back it just shows what
all the brushes do so for the large
brush it says the large brush is used
all over the body for a deep cleanse
that lofa and other body sponges don't
offer so it really gets in and you know
like exfoliates all those dead skin
cells and all that kind of stuff so
that's the first ten the second one is a
smaller one which looks like this is
definitely a lot softer like when you
feel it and this is a facial one so you
can wash your face with this and
basically one of the box it says it says
that these small facial brush cleanse
your face by getting deep into your
pores and I really really like this one
especially like on my nose because
that's where like it's worse for me and
like a much hand stuff so there's that
one but i really like it and then the
other one is the facial
fur which looks like this and it looks
like a little spongy thing and basically
what you do is you do use this to apply
on like lotion on your face and in the
box it says aids in the absorption I
cannot read today aids in the absorption
oh I saw their bright of your favorite
moisturizers so basically what you can
do is just put on a little bit of lotion
on here and then turn it on and kind of
buff it into your face it will kind of
help your face like lock-in and all the
moisture and stuff like that so I like
that and the last head that you get to
use is where they call it Pumas p um i
seee stone so it's like a little stone
like this so it looks like that and
basically what you use this for is um
you can rub off your dead skin cells
anywhere from your elbows to your heels
to your knees and i like to use it on my
heels because I don't really have dead
skin on my elbows or my knees I used to
but now I always pry open and stuff like
that so I don't really have problems
there just like on my heels i use it so
ever they like that too so that's how
books yeah so there's those are probably
all the little heads and i really like
it because unlike the clarisonic and
stuff like that if you kind of have more
of like a variety of like different
things like one for your body one for
your face one for your fields you know
so that's where I kind of like it a
little bit fatter than for example like
the clarisonic or something so also
along with the little um cleanser
thingamabob they also sent me little
like body gels and stuff like that and
they're dripping because they're what
because I always keep them in my shower
um so I'm just going to go through them
so the first one is the juniper berry
I've no idea of pronounce that you guys
know that I suck at this kind of stuff
looks like that and this is a cleansing
gel and it's purple and purple is my
favorite color all these things are
purple which like made me extra half
I don't know um but basically this is
just like any regular body gel 9 fluid
ounces looks like thats really liquidy
and it smells really good I think all of
these have this same smell if I'm right
and to me it smells like a berry
smoothie it reminds me of a smoothie I
don't know why but I really really like
the smell it's just very berry and
smoothie ish or whatever and um this
entire website companies all
cruelty-free because it doesn't the
little box right here on everything it
says cruelty-free so that's always good
so there's that it smells really good it
bubbles up really really nicely the next
one is the exfoliant body gel so this is
kind of the same thing except this one
has little like they're not even beads
they're like little I don't even know if
you can see that they're like little
strings I don't know what they are but
um I really like this one too so I like
that I think I like this one the best
actually and obviously I've used for a
lot of it I've been using this for like
an entire month so I'm just kind of been
switching off with these and then the
last thing that it also came with is the
body lotion and this looks like it's
full but the bottle is actually not
clear so you can't really like tell or
see how much I've actually used to this
but this is a hand and body lotion and I
really like this to it it smells the
same I think they all smell the same i'm
pretty sure unless my nose is like
retarded I don't know but um I really
like this lotion um the texture of this
is kind of like more watery it's not
really really watery but it's not like
thick like for example like shea butter
or something like that it's here why
don't I show you guys it like it's like
kind of water yesh like it reminds me of
like the texture of like sunscreen I
don't know um so yeah but I like it or
cut reminds me of like the Burt's Bees
consistency of like their bite lotions
yeah like that but I really really like
these I love the smell of them
I love the color just having them
sitting out like in my little shower and
stuff like that so yeah if you guys want
