a review on a brush set from sador lace
and it is called the vortex professional
makeup brushes set and this is the
little pamphlet that comes with it and I
just quickly wanted to mention before I
start this video that yes they did send
me these brushes to try them out for a
few weeks and then you know make a video
and tell you guys you know my thoughts
in each brush and stuff like that I was
super excited to try out this brush set
because overall it's very unique like
there's many different unique brushes in
here that I've never had before and it
was very fun to like try them out and
stuff like that and show you guys all
the brushes so and also I quickly just
want to say that this brush set was
created by a beauty guru here on YouTube
which i think is so cool and her
username is makeup I run run on the
little pamphlet it just talks all about
her and like that is so cool like I'm
jealous um I just decided to share that
you guys so fun fact also i do have a
discount code for all of you guys so
that will be in the downbar because i
don't remember it right now but all the
details about that will be in the
downbar so yeah let's get onto their
view so first I want to talk a little
bit about the brush belts that it comes
with because yes this set does come with
a brush belt which i think is really
cool because this is the first one I've
ever owned obviously the brushes are in
here but I like this a lot because I
like to do my makeup in my bathroom
before school and that's because there's
no sunlight outside and its really dark
my room and I have good lighting in
there but my bathroom counter is really
small and my bathroom is really small so
I like stand when I do my makeup and I
never have room for my brushes so this
is great because I've been using this
every day just to kind of strap it on my
waist and be able to you know have easy
access to all my brushes while I'm doing
my makeup so I've had a lot of use out
of this brush palette like personally
for me because of my little situation
also what I really like about this is
that not a lot of brush bolts actually
have this but this has a zipper that
zips all the way around so let me
just enough for you guys so you can see
that so yeah it's also really great for
traveling obviously because it keeps all
of your brushes like protected and all
that and also there's a lot of slots to
put like brushes in like it's crazy like
you've got pockets that are one big
pocket here there's a big pocket back
here there's like many different rows
and it's like that on the same like the
other side so there's definitely a lot
of room I could probably fit all my
brushes in here but yeah so I'm
definitely gonna be using this for like
vacation from now on and stuff so yeah
love this I'm pretty sure you can buy
them without the brush belt too but if
you don't have any way to kind of store
your brushes or like have them on the go
then this is a really nice kind of
organizational way to carry them yeah so
enough about that now I'm just gonna get
right into the brushes and also i have a
little pamphlet thing that the brushes
came with so i'm just going to read the
names off of these because like as I go
because I don't really know the names by
heart and i'm just going to do them in
the order that you see them so the first
one is the jumbo fan face brush and this
is definitely the most unique one
obviously because it's like BAM huge
this is like the biggest fan brush that
I've ever seen and this is also the
first one I've ever owned um I really
like this brush because it's very soft
and you can use it for many reasons but
to be honest this brush is probably the
one that I've used the least like I
never really use this brush that much
and that's because I don't really do
crazy eye makeup looks that I get a
bunch of Fallout and I have to like
sweep it off and stuff like that only
happened a couple times and this worked
great for that but um I don't know I
just I don't really have any like uses
for it just because like me personally I
don't really need it can use it for many
other things like you can use it for a
face powder which I still have to do
that and then also you can use it for
highlighting and contouring as well so
this is pretty like universal so you can
use it for different things but to be
honest like Tevin really uses that much
so the next brush is the two of contour
face brush and this is by far one of my
most used and most favorite from the kit
and this was actually my favorites video
as well but it looks like this I use it
for highlighting because i love
highlighting my face and this is the
perfect brush for it because of the
pointed tip i can just dip it or swirl
it into highlighter and just get it on
my cheekbones and my nose and all of
that mm-hmm and then it's all so big and
poufy so you can also like blend it out
so this is really nice and by far my
favorite brush so then you've got the
dome contour brush and this is also a
face brush and this reminds me a lot of
the bhcosmetics one that you that I used
to use for my bronzer but this one is a
little bit bigger I wish I had it but I
don't have with me so I can't compare
them but I love using this for contour
my face this is the brush that I used
for my bronzer because it's like perfect
for the temples and forehead because I
have a pretty good forehead and I like
to contour it and a little bit on my
cheek so yeah I love this for bronzer I
use it every single day ever since i
first started trying out these brushes
and I like this one a lot it's very
dense and it's like a dome shape so it's
nice fresh yeah so then the next brush
is the flattop buffer love this brush oh
my goodness recently like my acne has
been pretty good so I haven't been
really needing to put on liquid
foundation so mainly I've just been
doing powder but I have been wearing
liquid foundation like twice a week I'd
say so what i do i use this brush it's
very like dense and thick and this is
great for liquid you can also use it for
powder but i think it's better for like
liquid foundation and I like it a lot
because it really like blends it out and
kind of buffs it in i love like that
buffing motion I don't really know why I
found a new love so I just been like
crazy obsessed with this brush and I
real
like it so that is it for all the face
brushes now I'm going to get into the
eye makeup brushes which there are a lot
of them oh by the way there's 13 brushes
in this kit total so just in case if
you're wondering that so the first one
is the universal blender I brush and it
looks like this sorry it's a little bit
dirty like I was gonna clean up for this
video but then I got lazy so i just
can't kind of like quickly um what does
it cold spot clean um and I didn't
really do that good of a job so sorry
about that but yeah so it just looks
like this and the title is the perfect
title the title the name of it is
perfect for this brush because it is
really you know your Universal blender
brush you can use this to glenda I shed
on the bottom and you can also just use
it in the crease which is my favorite
way so I just like using this to like
blend eyeshadows in the crease and on my
lid and stuff like that so I think
everybody needs like that basic blending
brush and this is the perfect one so the
next brush is the flat synthetic eye
brush and it looks like this and I like
using this for cream based products so
like cream eyeshadows and stuff like
that because um it's really like wide
but then it's like thin and its really i
don't know i really like it like petting
the cream eyeshadow on my lid with this
so the next one is the synthetic blender
brush and it looks like this and i love
these two brushes together it's like
your perfect kind of cream eyeshadow
like little duo right here like i feel
like these would be married if Russia's
would get married like these would be
married because I like using this one to
kind of pad on the cream like I show and
this is really great for blending it
also i really like using this to blend
my NYX jumbo eye shadow pencils um cuz
like no I just like doing that um and
sometimes my fingers like I didn't wash
it I just don't want to like touch my
face so that's why it's great to have
some sorting some sort of a blending
brush that is good for that so these are
perfect for like cream eyeshadows and
stuff the next brush is the pointed
crease brush trying to find it here it
is I like this brush a lot it looks like
this and what I like using this for
obviously
grace that's name of the brush but I
like this lot because it has a very
pointed tip for a blending brush and
whenever I do eye makeup looks I always
have like the darkest color in my outer
V or outer corner or whatever you call
it so this is a really nice brush to
kind of very lightly like tap it in the
eye shadow get into your outer V and
then take some sort of brush like this
and then just blend it out so I like
this a lot for my crease it's super
great um and yeah I don't know i just
really like it the next one is this one
right here it's called the Browse puli
duo and i was so happy to get this brush
because you guys know that i fill in my
eyebrows and before i got this brush i
would just use any ordinary like
eyeliner brush because it's you know
small and angled but then whenever i
want to put on eyeliner like I wouldn't
have any brushes because these would be
dirty and this was like my eyebrow brush
so I was super happy to finally get like
my own like eyebrow brush that is
specifically for my eyebrows you know so
now i have a bunch of eyeliner brushes
that i can use for my eyeliner and send
my brows and yeah it's duo so on this
side it has the little spooley which is
the first time i've ever had one and I
actually like it like brushing it
through this is really great for like if
you put like powder like the eyebrow
powder or whatever um this is great for
like blending it kind of so I like using
this after and on the other side it's
just hmm like angled show the next one
is the bent liner and this is the first
time I've ever got one of these types of
brushes looks like this because i know
you guys um can get these anywhere like
from any place because these were like
really popular at one point and i never
got it so this is my first one I didn't
know that applying gel eyeliner would be
so easy with this like honestly when you
use other
shows like sometimes your hands in the
way and like this brush is like heaven
because it's bent and it like you can
see what you're doing at all times when
you're using this brush because of
little bent shape that it has and that's
what I love about it so I love this one
so much and I get a lot of uses out of
this one okay the next one is the
detailed shader this brush is so cute
can i just turned out by saying that is
that weird look at how cute it is it's
like a little shader brush but it's like
a little stub I love it so much so you
can obviously use this for many
different things but what I like using
this for is highlighting my little like
my little um my inner tear duct or my
inner corners just because it's like
that perfect size because it's like not
too small not too big too um like pet
the eyeshadow in there so that's why I
really like using this for and I like
doing that so I don't know I think it's
really cute I like this brush so the
next one is the angled detail brush and
it just looks like this have really
nothing to say about it um I like this
brush a lot i love using it for
eyeshadow like at the bottom right here
but like i don't know i mean nothing
nothing really special about this brush
obviously it's a good brush but like I
don't really have anything special to
say about it because it's pretty it's
like your average standard eyeliner
brush so the last but not least brush
that comes with this kid oh my god I
lost it where to go oh nevermind it's
just so small I couldn't see it but it's
the capped lip brush and it looks like
this when it's in the cap and it's all
nice and shiny and then you pull it out
and you've got this little brush right
here and once again like the other one
this is just your average lip brush I
really like it for blending out like lip
liner lipstick all that good stuff so
yeah it just looks like that nothing
really too fancy or anything but it's
really cute because it's obviously great
for on-the-go you can like load up some
product on here if you want but
personally I just like taking
with me your lip gloss with me but you
know if you don't have a lot of space I
guess you know but I like it a lot and I
actually get a lot like use with this so
yeah I think that's great too so that is
it for my review overall I love this
brush kit definitely recommend it for
first-timers I don't recommend it
because um it doesn't have it doesn't
have some of your basics that you really
need but if you like to collect makeup
brushes and you know you love to try out
different things and you're really into
makeup definitely recommend it um just
because you know you've got a bunch of
brushes they can play around with and
really get to kind of like find out and
choose your favorites and all that stuff
so I think the best thing about this is
it's just a very unique like brush
collection in general like all the
brushes are very different and you have
a huge variety of like different brushes
and that's why I really like it's really
fun to like play around with and stuff
and yeah so that concludes my review for
