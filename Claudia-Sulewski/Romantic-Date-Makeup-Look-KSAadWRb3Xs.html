and romantic look just start off by
applying on your favorite foundation and
your favorite pressed powder I'm
starting off by priming my eyelids with
my teeny Beauty ambrosia cream eyeshadow
I'm blending this product out with my
fingers onto my lids and my lower lash
line this product will give us the
perfect purple background to apply our
eye shadows onto and lasting all day
using my Urban Decay Naked 3 palette I'm
grabbing the shade burnout which is a
medium toned pink and applying it onto
the center of my lids
I am then grabbing the shade nooner and
applying it into my crease with a big
fluffy brush this matte brown eyeshadow
will help to smoke up the look making it
perfect for any evening occasion I'm
then grabbing one of the darker shades
called darkside and applying that into
the outer v / crease of my eyes to
darken up the look always be sure to
blend everything out to avoid any harsh
lines after that I'm describing the same
eyeshadow and just bringing it down into
my lower lashline
to brighten up the look I'm grabbing the
first shade called strange and applying
it into the inner tear-duct of my eyes
as well as on my brow bone this light
pink eyeshadow helps to girl up the look
making it look very romantic and
innocent for the eyeliner I'm using my
favorite double-ended NYX liquid liner
so first I'm starting out by creating a
thin line on my upper lash line and
winging it out I'm also lining my
waterline with some black eyeliner
after that just grab your favorite
mascara and just apply it onto the upper
and lower lashes I'm using benefit
they're real mascara
it feels so scary you get it all now if
you really want to impress those around
you then you can always apply on some
falsies so I got mine from Jake at
beauty for lips I'm starting off by
applying on the NYX butter lipstick in
the shade of sugar wafer which is just a
nude color I'm then topping that with a
hot pink lip gloss from pop Beauty
lastly for cheeks I wanted to go with a
baby pink shade so I'm using elfs blush
in the shade tickled pink and that is it
for the makeup look
now I quickly want to show you guys what
I did with my nails so I grabbed two
different colored nail polishes and
started off by applying white nail
polish onto all of my nails then using
my Zoya nail polish in the shade dot and
using that as an accent color to apply
onto my ring finger and my thumb
creating accent nails is a super-fun
trend for me to try out with different
pastels and white and that is it for
today's video I hope you guys enjoyed it
be sure to check out FC comm for a few
of the things that have been featured in
today's video but that is it and I will
see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
