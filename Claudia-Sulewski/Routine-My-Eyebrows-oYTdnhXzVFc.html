pretty fast video so I'm sorry it's
probably going to be like less than five
minutes and basically today I'm just
going to be talking all about my
eyebrows because I get a lot of
questions on if I get my eyebrows done
if I wax them tweeze them so I filled
them in a little I used to fill them in
all that stuff so today it's gonna be
kind of like an eyebrows like 101 type
of video but I just kind of talked about
that with you guys so first off I have
never gotten whatever that's done before
I think it's just because I have really
huge like trust issues like I'm just
scared that if I go get my eyebrows done
someone is going to like wax it or
tweeze it all off and then I'm gonna
have like no eyebrows I can be really
skinny and they're gonna look really
ugly so that's what I'm kind of scared
to go get my eyebrows done cuz I'm just
afraid that they're gonna mess up I
don't know
so basically I just tweeze my eyebrows
by myself i shape them by myself they
don't really have that awesome of a
shape it's not that perfect cuz
obviously I do them at home but you know
they're pretty good for doing them at
home because I don't know I don't think
they're that bad so I shaped my own
eyebrows I just used tweezerman tweezers
I don't know where they are right now
but they're like little tweezers that
are hot pink and white polka dots and
they're from tweezerman and tweezerman
like the brand is probably my favorite
tweezer brand ever just because I don't
know I just like it the best it works
the best for me and for some of you guys
have been asking
yes I do fill in my eyebrows just
because I feel like my eyebrows are a
little bit too light for what I like so
like as you can see my eyebrows look
like they're like dark brown kind of and
that's how I like it
so I do fill them in and I use the
benefit brows and go go yeah brow and I
shaping kit so it looks like this I've
shown this in I think two of my videos
before so I'm pretty sure that all of
you guys have seen me talk about this
because it was in my August favorites
video so basically the front just looks
like this and it's like cardboard it's
really thin and it's pretty small I
don't know I like it you know you can
fit in your purse or whatever and it's
basically when you open it up it's
magnetic and it just has a mirror and
then right here it has like that gel
stuff which I use the most and then
there's two powders sorry my nails look
horrible my nail polish is like chipping
off
but I have dark brown and light brown
and then they have a little double-sided
brush a mini eyeliner to highlights that
I don't really use and tweezers that I
don't really use either so yeah this is
how it looks and of course I knew
something was gonna fall out but yeah
that's basically how it looks it's
really small and compact and I like it
so yeah I've been using this everyday
ever since I bought it which was like a
month and a half ago or two months or
something like that and it actually
stays on really really well even like
after washing my face I'll still be on
for a little like this stuff can last
for a long time it lasts all day it
doesn't melt off or anything like that
so I really like it and yeah so now I'm
just gonna show you guys a clip of me
actually filling in my eyebrows and I'm
just gonna have like a little voiceover
and stuff like that so yeah keep
watching if you want to find out how I
fill in my eyebrows alright keep
watching okay so these are my playing
eyebrows and you can see that they're
just a little bit too light for me then
what I prefer but they're not really
that bad but yeah so first I'm gonna
start out by grabbing the angled side of
a mini brush and dipping it into the gel
part and then I'm just going to very
lightly just kind of like whisk it on my
eyebrow starting from the inner corner
to like the outer part and I'm doing
very very light and small strokes then I
don't know why but I always like blend
it help with my finger and yes and I'm
just gonna work on other eyebrow
so now you can already tell that they're
looking a little bit more darker and
fuller and I don't know I just like hit
a lot better than before so now I'm
gonna grab the more shader sign of the
brush and dip it into the light
eyeshadow and it's got to Pat it on my
eyebrows to set the gel part and help it
last all day and now you're done so I
like it a lot better than before just
because now I feel like they're a little
bit thicker and fuller and they frame my
face a lot better now and
I don't know if you notice anything
different anything No
um yeah so that's basically it for
today's video hope you enjoyed this
really quick one and I will talk to guys
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
