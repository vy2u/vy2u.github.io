your favorite base coat and you're just
going to apply it all over your nails
now for this now tutorial I'm not going
to be using a base color just because I
like the look of having natural nails so
if your nails have kind of like a yellow
tint to them because of wearing too much
nail polish then you can always apply on
a nude nail polish to kind of create the
same effect or you can just use your
favorite color so it doesn't really
matter about the base so we're first
going to start out with the middle
finger and the first nail polish you
have to grab is any black nail polish
I'm just using this one from sinful
colors so for this step you're just
going to be drawing these shoulders of
the screen guy and also the hood so make
sure that you make the hood shape or
whatever the circle in the middle make
sure that it's pretty big and thick just
because you're going to be drawing the
face inside of it so you don't want it
to be too small but yeah it should look
a little something like this
so for the next step you're going to
grab any white nail polish I'm just
using this art deco one and you are
going to create the face of the scream
guy and he kind of has a weird face it's
just like a regular face or they're
really long chin so as you can see
that's what I'm doing here and of course
you always want to wait till it
completely dries after every single step
I forgot to mention it but once you've
let that dry just grab the black again
and now we are going to be drawing the
face on the guys so I'm going to be
using a dotting tool and you can also
use a toothpick it doesn't really matter
but also you need some kind of surface
to dab the nail polish on obviously i
use my traditional little dish that i
always use but basically you're just
going to draw the face on the screen guy
and i definitely recommend looking at a
picture while you're doing this that's
what i did he kind of has a weird eyes a
really long mouth and a nose so i guess
just kind of watch and learn
so once you are done with that then you
are completely finished with the middle
finger and now we're going to be working
on the other ones so first we're going
to grab a red nail polish I chose this
one from OPI and it's a really nice dark
red and it reminds me of the color of
blood so that is why I chose it because
on our three other nails we're going to
be kind of drawing blood marks so on our
ring finger we're going to be drawing a
handprint and this looks like it'd be
hard but it seriously wasn't hard at all
the face was definitely harder than the
handprint but all you really got to do
is just google bloody handprint and just
completely copy off a photo and that's
kind of what helped me out or you could
just watch and see how I did it so I
can't really explain how to do this
stuff but just kind of watch and learn
so that's how my handprint turned out
and now we're going to be working on the
index finger and pinky finger and we're
going to be doing the same thing on both
fingers and basically what you're just
going to do is create three lines and
just kind of drag them down imperfectly
and this is going to kind of give the
illusions of like bloody hands smearing
on the nail so this doesn't have to be
perfect at all it actually looks better
when it's less perfect so just kind of
create the lines and kind of make them
look imperfect I guess I don't know but
yes so once you don't that you are
completely finished with your first four
nails so really really simple and fast
so now we're going to be working on our
thumb so far the thumb we're going to be
drawing a knife so I'm going to start by
grabbing any grain nail polish and this
one is from china glaze and I'm just
going to start drawing it the blade
then I'm going to grab a black nail
polish and I'm just going to start
drawing the handle I wanted to add a
little bit more detail to the knife so I
just used my white nail polish and
created a couple lines on the blade
so of course you got to put some blood
on there so I'm just going to grab the
same nail polish I was using before and
I'm just going to very muscley kind of
apply it to the tip of my blade to give
it even more detail I decided to put a
little bit of blood on the top and
bottom corner of my nail and now you're
done with the thumb so the last step is
to grab any top coat and just very
lightly apply it to all of your nails to
make sure that they don't chip off or
anything like that and once you don't
that you are completely done so I hope
you guys enjoyed today's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
