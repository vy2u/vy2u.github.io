already a mess I don't really know why I
chose to stand in today's video we're
doing it I just I feel so free what is
up you guys oh my gosh it's been so long
since I've uploaded on this channel in
the past month February was like a
little crazy celebrated my 22nd birthday
I'm officially 22 which feels very weird
but that ended up being one of those
things where my birthday was celebrated
for like five days and I don't really
know why I didn't really plan on that
happening but it fell on a Monday so we
started like on Friday
it just it consumed a lot but it was a
lot of fun if you guys will just see a
bunch of photos and memories from that
night then you can follow me on
Instagram it was really cute I had a lot
of disposable cameras and through a very
large party in this apartment the next
morning was very fun after that I got
sick for a week go figures but then
after that my mom visit in town and I
actually blogged a bunch and that vlog
is up
I am finally filming my skincare routine
for you guys this is probably my number
one most requested video you guys are
always commenting about products I use
what tips I have we're gonna be talking
about all of that I mess around with so
many different products I really don't
have like a set routine of a few things
that I really like using I'll show you
guys a shot of my bathroom with all of
the skincare stuff but I get a lot of
packages from different PR companies so
I'm always trying out different things
and also just purchasing so much of my
own because I'm so adamant on keeping my
skin in its tip-top shape there's only
one product that I'll be sharing that
has to do with like breakouts that I use
because now when it comes to skincare
I'm mostly focusing on keeping my skin
moisturize protected from the Sun
anything that has to do with like age
rewind and just keeping my soft young
skin for as long as possible that's kind
of the goal I guess I'll just get that
one product out of the way sorry this
video is gonna be really messy but the
only product that I use that has to do
with like pimples breaking out stuff
like that is the Mario Badescu skincare
drying lotion so many people talk about
this it is well worth the hype you just
stick a q-tip into the bottle and just
spot treat any problem areas also when
it comes to keeping my skin clear I
follow these steps religiously I just
want to power through them because I
think they deeply impact the look and
the health and the state of your skin
number one never never never never never
never touch your face throughout the day
I understand that sounds very dramatic
let me explain the only times I'm really
touching my face are when I'm like doing
my routine in the morning at nighttime
and my hands are washed and when I'm
playing on my makeup obviously I will
literally like wipe down my now and like
my clothes and then just use the nail to
scratch my face like I never I don't do
this the only time I touch my face
throughout the day oh god this is like
this is really embarrassing to admit but
the only time actually that I would
touch my face throughout the day is for
an Instagram when you like lay on your
hand on the table you know you know what
I'm talking about everyone does it the
next one always wash your face before
you go to bed this is a huge thanks
with like the dirt and oil and makeup
that's been caked on your face sleeping
in that is just allowing everything to
sink in that not only creates breakouts
but it creates extra grease it also
creates wrinkles do not sleep with your
makeup on that is the worst thing you
could ever do sleep with your hair up if
you have a lot of product in your hair
or if you know hairspray whatever and
you don't feel like washing your hair
that night keep your hair in a bun or in
a ponytail so that you're not like
sleeping on your hair because all that
also sinks into your skin definitely
switch out your pillowcases or clean
them whatever because you're you're
sleeping on that and you know stuff just
gets on it's time to talk about products
I'm gonna try to go in order of how I
use them / categories because I don't
use all of these things every single day
the first thing I'm gonna talk about is
cleanser I think it's just important to
find something that has really simple
sensitive ingredients not like any harsh
chemicals or anything
I am completely obsessed with the fresh
soy face cleanser for all skin types
I've gone through two bottles of this
this is literally like basically empty
you guys know how much I love fresh so
you guys will see that I've incorporated
a bunch of other brands in this video as
well because I wanted to hold myself
back go outside of my comfort zone show
you guys other things I want to quickly
talk about micellar water because this
is a huge thing that I discovered within
the last like two years these are really
great for the days or moments that you
are super lazy and you don't want to
like slash water and do the whole thing
you just put on a cotton pad and you rub
it around your face I like using this
during the morning because sometimes
like washing your face in the morning is
kind of unnecessary and a little harsh
because like all you've done is sleep
also wanted to mention makeup wipes I
use them all the time as well especially
if you're like sleeping over somewhere
you're staying out later than you
thought you would whatever you want to
take your makeup off I always have
makeup wipes in the car sometimes I will
literally bring like a little micellar
water with me in my purse after washing
my face in the morning I will use this
product which is probably my most
favorite at the moment just because I've
never even like heard of a product like
this ahh I love it so much and it's just
an extra step in my routine this is the
fresh black tea kombucha facial
treatment essence this is one of their
newest products it's like a essence
water which I had no idea
what that meant when I first heard about
this but basically it's a super super
watery substance and I clearly I'm not
very educated with this but all you do
is you splash a little bit into your
palm go like this and just wipe your
face you don't use a cotton pad you just
use your hands it's like a protector
guard for your face against any sort of
air pollution which is a huge thing out
here in Los Angeles because there are so
many cars and everything everywhere but
also with like technology pollution as
well from computer screens cell phones
TVs all that stuff and obviously I am
around those very very often it dries
within like 10 seconds if even that long
and it preps your skin for everything
else I'm obsessed with this next up I've
got two serums to talk about serums and
oils are the products that I would
recommend splurging on or investing in
because I think they go such a long way
so many people are so scared to put like
oils on their faces and all this stuff
but they bring in so many minerals and
vitamins and just like all the important
things onto your skin I swear by them
that is what's changed my skin and the
way that it looks and everything so
serums first this is the drunk elephant
Seifer mad a serum I love this little
guy I love this brand in general I'm
pretty new to it and I've been using a
bunch of other products but this is the
first one that kind of stood out and I
was like wow yes I've using this all the
time I just do two pumps and I apply it
to my skin also this one reminds me a
lot of the oil Henriksen truth serum
which I highly recommend I'll have a
photo of it I'm just too lazy to go
purchase it and I want to go through
this before I go and pick that one up
but I really really recommend that one
and then also I wanted to bring up this
serum my brother got this for me for
Christmas like a year and a half ago or
two whatever it's been this is from the
brand a stop I hope I'm pronouncing that
right but this is their parsley seed
antioxidant serum very very moisturizing
for you I like this one at nighttime a
lot so this is kind of like my nighttime
serum basically it just got a little
dropper and so I will just apply on a
nice smooth layer to my skin
next up going into oils I am obsessed
with facial oils this is
probably the product that I play around
the most with because my skin doesn't
really react when I change up oils I
don't know as long as I have like the
base products I consistent this is where
I kind of have the most fun with
basically I don't even know what I'm
saying guys I want to talk about these
threes so the first one is the farce
Ollie rose gold elixir 24k gold infused
Beauty oil they sent me this a while
back and I remember it was kind of
sitting in my bathroom and I hadn't
tried it out yet and then I remember
seeing a Maddy brag using it one time
and I was like damn that looks familiar
I think I like owned that and she was
like oh my god it's my favorite oil in
the entire world and her skin is glowing
so I went home tried it out I'm obsessed
with it it smells so good and it's so
soft and luxurious feeling on your skin
sometimes I'll mix like two or three
drops into my moisturizer but to put oil
alone on my face I only do before bed I
also love the fresh sea berry
moisturizing face oil it has omegas
three six seven and nine hundred percent
pure moisture with sea buckthorn oil
this is kind of a staple for me and a
go-to and then also I've definitely
talked about this one with you guys it's
the old Henrickson pure truth youth
activating oil nourish repair and
brighten with pure rose hip seed oil I
like to mix it into serums moisturizers
whatever I mix all this stuff to it when
it comes to serums and oils like my
bathroom is like a chemistry lab and I'm
just dropping things into my palm and I
mix it up and I do that it doesn't break
me out it actually just kind of like
makes it more fun for me and it works so
yeah I'm like mixing oils and stuff all
the time
moisturizers face lotions this one I
just have to bring up I haven't used it
in a while because it's basically done
and I've just been avoiding like
purchasing duplicates just because I
have so many other new products that I'm
trying out so I'm definitely kind of
sitting on this one for a little bit but
I had to bring it up because this was
one of the first like face products that
changed the game for me and got me
really really hyped and excited and
passionate about skincare it is the
Clinique dramatically different
moisturizing gel so so good as like a
morning moisturizer to put on before
your makeup it is
light it sinks in it keeps your face
moisturized lately these are the two
that I've been sticking with anytime I'm
going outside or I'm driving in my car
and I'm gonna be exposed to Sun I always
always put on sunscreen and it's a huge
thing for me as far as just maintaining
my youthful skin and not wanting
wrinkles and stuff like that this is the
fresh black tea age delay lotion I just
love like the black tea line in general
from them this one you just twist it up
it pops open and then you do that this
freakin lighting is like driving me
insane I'm so sorry so far this has been
my best find for SPF like lotions last
moisturizer that I'm talking about today
is the Tula hydrating day and night
cream with probiotic technology this is
probably the newest product in my life
as far as the ones that I'm talking
about today the first use of this
product I was blown away it is so silky
and soft in your skin and it sinks in
but it keeps it very moisturized this
has pretty much become like my nighttime
cream super super obsessed with this and
lately I've been trying out a bunch of
Tula's like other products in this line
as well and I've been very very
impressed
as far as eyes go like under-eye circles
I don't really focus on them just
because I feel like I'm already putting
everything else on my eyes that I'm
putting on my face
the one product that I feel like does
make a difference and I do like using it
on days where I know I'll be filming or
I don't know I'm in the mood this is the
o Henriksen banana I feel like I'm
saying it will Hendrickson wrong is it
like a la 100 sorry this is their banana
bright eye cream the vitamin C collagen
boosting love this stuff I just play a
little bit to my finger and then just
tap it underneath my eyes I've only got
two more products and they are both
fresh products I told you guys really
tried to go outside of my comfort zone
but I just I use a lot of fresh really
liked them as far as exfoliating my skin
I am obsessed with this exfoliator I
don't know if I've ever talked about
this on YouTube which if I haven't that
really surprises me because I keep this
in my shower I use it at least once a
week
it is the
greatest smelling product that leaves
your skin feeling so baby smooth like
little babies but it is the fresh sugar
face polished natural exfoliant with
real strawberry seeds refines and
nourishes oh my gosh I've gone through a
few of these bottles this is like the
only face exfoliant that I care to use
I'm so happy with it I'm obsessed with
it I love it I keep it in my shower I
feel like I really didn't get into masks
in this video just because I use so many
different types of masks I switch off
from like peel-off masks to sheet masks
to just like regular masks that you wash
off I feel like with those you can
totally have fun and play around with
them just because like you literally are
just putting it on your face for five
minutes ten minutes twenty whatever so I
really want to focus on more like the
staple products that I'm wearing
throughout the night throughout the day
all that stuff but the one mask that I
felt was worthy to talk about is the
fresh black tea instant perfecting mask
this is actually the first product that
I ever tried from fresh and just got me
hooked it got me addicted the best way
to describe this one oh it's literally
empty there's like one use of it left it
is so soft and whipped and airy on your
face and it takes away every single
discoloration this is kind of like my
little secret I'm popping my knee up cuz
I've been standing this whole time um I
just apply it onto my face for like 10
minutes whatever wash it off and then go
through my whole routine and it actually
makes the biggest difference which is
awesome to say because I feel like
sometimes with masks you're like okay my
skin like feels nice but I don't really
know if I did anything this is one of
those that just like really does a lot
and you're like wow I hope you guys
enjoyed today's video I hope it didn't
feel too rushed or anything I'm just
like super jumbled in my head and feel
sick yeah if you guys have any questions
leave them down below if you have any
products that you're obsessed with I'm
gonna have everything linked down below
for you guys I hope I was able to answer
a bunch of you guys's questions and
whatnot as far as skincare goes I really
hope you guys enjoyed today's video and
I will see you guys for a new one next
