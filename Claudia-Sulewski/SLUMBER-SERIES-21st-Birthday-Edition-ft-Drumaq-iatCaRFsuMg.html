a 20 minute long potion I'm surprised
she's like not melt down and we're going
to dig into this cake and while we're
doing that he's got to be fun to make
list of 21 things and the combination of
memories that we share together
yes and just things that we've learned
over the past 21 years ago Oh
better than the 1000 degree nice yeah Oh
oh my god you're really struggling first
memory
honestly like first memory when I first
moved out here you have already been
living your behavior from Syria we're
going to talk about the first party it
was a hard it was a party it was like a
rager for like we're on Bardo in Florida
people there's a tennis court and that
was a mansion party just kind of court
to a cool everything just go for it like
so many groups of people you didn't know
anyone we wasn't shown on - oh we can't
decision you're going to be it was fun
and until someone got stabbed that's
great
stabbed in the arm which is just like oh
my gosh tasers were pulled out or
anything like we heard that's all about
that right okay camera literally ran the
first lesson that we wanted to really
charlie touch on it's okay to see no it
is so important I think this goes with
so many different things whether
everyday it's okay to say no to stuff
that you don't want to do it's okay to
also like discipline yourself and say no
to things that you want to do but when
you know that the bottom now that's like
that you have a video to edit like what
there's a party like some legends go
clean up I often have difficulties in
juggling my social life yeah because I'm
friends so many different groups of
people and sometimes it's so hard to
keep up with those friendships and make
promises when like your regular like
your problems with someone about that
but then you have a meeting and then
you're like oh my god but I wanted
people please and I I like want people
to say yes to everything and sometimes
can you sit down and be like will this
situation but then it hit me and bring
me joy and not stress me out it's a lot
of times as I get stressed because of
like I don't know losing time is what
was this crazy is weird I just better
yeah yeah
just by tomorrow okay what we're going
are cooked and phase oh my god if you
want to claudius vlog you remember no
you lived it with that it was not long
in different areas of California
literally what December's that go and
literally bought a new game and plated
our entire triplet we didn't go outside
we were like all right
stay in our hotel room and play the
board game that we also have at home we
went to the airport four hours early it
is please and just found a stable of new
games of Catan I think before Oregon and
also this game like it makes you hate
your friends like oh we're getting like
angry there was a lot of beef they're
out there judge there is so much tension
Allen perform and these were made
everything this is a huge wonderful plus
as well remembering names final you guys
is become irrelevant as you get older
you're just meeting more people at
events or display anything really but
like anything you remember somebody's
name and you can like say back to them
before you exit that conversation its
resonates of them they like stages it's
so powerful it's so powerful Shirley is
I chose my pair you can say you here to
say your present in the conversation and
yeah like you want to involve yourself
exactly a memory side this one you guys
may have experienced with us a lot of
the solid walls which is great I know
before we actually moved into this
beautiful home together
we were never roommate um but we live in
the same apartment complex what happened
your lease ended early like oh yeah I
please and in like a week earlier yeah
oh so they move into my Jack's apartment
elect me and Josh had a free night sleep
over and me and Kluber oh my god do they
know that it's like super me and blue um
had a genefique over and it was just
iconic look you you're going to do our
next lesson that we've learned it's kind
of where to have it I talk about this
all the time but making your bed every
single morning this is actually I think
the best lesson I've probably ever
learned in my entire life
it literally will change your entire day
Larry if you have a made bed a chess is
sending you up for a more productive and
accessible and just like happier day
like you're going to be more inclined to
like need your house and do something
great and then come home and getting
into a bed it made something for the
best thing ever
this one is so funny my life is
everything to them yeah this is recent
it's a memory but not a memory that
shuttle I only work together okay so you
guys know
next each other literally our doors art
may depart to be depart like so close to
each other this was like sometime
January right yeah we were going home
both in LA both like doing nothing for
five days in each other for five days
five days we're sleeping at home every
single night every single values each
other was for high days and we thought
if you're like me I don't want you after
Christmas I know I already you know it
and literally like running your arms I
was like oh my god I think the reason
why is because I had so many meetings
stop insulting accept your attention
you're in school and so you're God all
day we literally wake up early and so
the fact that we went five days is
incredible like our record will ever be
able to be thought that seriously so
funny so the next one is a lesson that
we have for you guys and this one is
basically just to surround ourselves
with people who make you happy and are
worth your time that's sounds weird to
say but like we'll break it down where
goes down very much so applies to post
high school lives I feel like you kind
of get to choose who you spend time with
yeah and like who are going to become
your lifelong friend no I know you are
going to be the gay uncle of all of my
fill time Lady Gaga Joe I don't prefer I
think it's very important to notice
which people make you feel happy and
make you want to be the best version of
yourself and the people that you ought
to be like aspire to be like I'm Andrew
and I'm like I think probably you like a
witch whisperer J already happy when you
realize that and you have that kind of
list of people in your mind put time
into those friendships and make those
memories whatever because that is
honestly what's going to keep you going
and along with your life rich and
beautiful and looking forward exactly
blow granting love racing on this
channel
cheers to that girl alright you can't
read that I did a full layer on you I
did focus on you oh here we are
is it convinced me if I
drew $5,000 to add this one into the
video been joining us yes there was one
night where drew did my makeup Joe
Graham and it looks so hot I literally
went out we weren't out yeah exactly
shortly after that I was like dude you
have to let me do your makeup like I
want to eat your face I want to chisel
the stick poke your face and you did I
did it all I am so proud of myself for
Drew letting me put the photo in for one
point one sex one composite and see it
for you all for one second photo has
never been anywhere besides my camera
ever every truck no beautiful you do the
whole thing is a crisis we look at the
ring light chewy put it in oh yeah it
was all right or even right that's
already been a medical catch as you can
my next lesson is to say yeah yeah can
you further explain drew Oh
basically this means we'll just this one
are we pushing yourself to leave your
comfort zone yes which is something that
is really difficult to do because you
can be like look I just wanna be any
social or like tell me nothing but
sometimes it's really beneficial to
leave your house and like put yourself
in a situation that may be a little bit
uncomfortable just to grow and learn
something new from it exactly I do
believe that you regret the things you
don't do more than the things you do
yeah and so it's very important to be
able to kind of look back on your life
and be like okay some of these things I
need to do just to experience life you
know just to enjoy myself and that's not
look I'm just stop taking so seriously
that's a good one next one we're going
to tie that in there so it's segue into
that is to not take less so they promise
you a little bit fun a Kyrie is
seriously move it woo okay back to the
men okay this one is really weird Lexi's
mom was bought us like multiple fans
and something we were obsessed guys we
had them in these the same two dishes
used to bring them over to all without a
part of all the time out and they would
come with the bowls make you like okay
okay cool audience so how is your day
going great and then we be like okay
it's my third aggressive about a big
adventure
exactly we were very possessive we had
the same relationship with that sand
that we do with Dexter yeah yeah we that
was literally pre Dexter my god it was a
first time out on the first pad it's why
I feel very passionate about this point
yeah yeah I read this somewhere online
and it really resonated with me and I
Viennese nothing until you bring it to
life and it's so true so true and
relevant especially because we're both
creators yeah so we have ideas all the
time and so we did have an idea and get
excited about it but not actually like
pursue it and make it realized when you
do it's just like the best looking thing
and amazing so many people just doubt
their creativity and throw their ideas
out the window but have a good comes
from yeah now this one is something
which all of our roommates do yes and I
think it's like so important and I
really encourage all you guys to do if
you feel the way we feel about each
other yeah yeah so every night before we
go to bed we always like oh there that
we love each other because we do but we
have a cute little twist on it we just
say one love we literally like will be
walk up within like one Lola laughs love
you said don't for it because you just
you just never know what's gonna happen
and to remind the people that you
actually love that you love them all the
time is just the greatest thing ever
very very importantly life-changing
crucial and recent everything 41 off
support bring it off you it just do
anything honored if they have why this
don't be afraid don't be afraid I just
won its my wild girl I don't think you
got a new that we had a Tina yeah it was
our favor state bathroom Christmas break
all but being back to that one yeah
that's what it was it is literally a
celebration because that was so I what I
know we are
trimmer one night and that was they
another memory that we had together it
was definitely a fear of knowing each
other
yes we had a hotel for the night a
staycation he says this hotel it was
like way too fancy for for young kids to
say I think there was only one bed but
we all four slept on it though we win
you want stuff hit by car that night I
did almost die um what's a closely
government death yeah it was scary
we were like all you have this tree and
like Durance is the car that was not
driving properly at one point we took
like a quick grocery shopping trip and
you're for some reason bought a fuzzy
bag and you look so funny I remember day
I realized in here literally walking was
like this fuzzy bag and I was like oh my
god I thought oh my god that's other
wins the next lesson that we learned is
that not everything has to be perfectly
done and perfectly planned
we're both perfectionist to the extreme
like too much I feel like yeah our
biggest flaw which doesn't sound like a
big blob but it actually can be very
hurtful to things that we want to do
because there's much perfection is that
we sometimes maybe don't finish things
or it it's always like not happy with
the final product essentially in general
I feel like I pre-plan a lot of things
yeah I need to go with the flow yeah a
spontaneous spontaneous is one of those
my favorite traits and other people you
know I don't necessarily have it in me
so with it I'm like instantly attracted
to them just absolutely I am need that
more my life yes I would literally
attracted to people who are adventurous
and 1% random things because I want to
experience that with them Joe I think
that is one thing shout-out to Lexi love
I love you I love you she brought a lot
of spontaneity into our memories and
life and stuff this one is up text II
have T no I'm saying baby Wilson this is
my first time using either only a hind
leg
I'm amazed that exactly okay so the last
memory that we're going to share with
you it's serious but hilarious funny
we're exactly don't happen to you at
least four times then you you aren't
living
okay so we've lived in this house for
nearly two years yeah we're working on
your two and so no we have a good
relationship with our landlord he's
chill he's amazing during the first year
we did have a few pickup yeah if you
will there was this one party that we
threw mmm
with a party that turned into like Oh
Rachel where would be where we did you
know most of us exactly every single
neighbor in our like block area called
me complain yeah our landlord called me
and he was like Claudia I'm not happy to
be making this call and you're not gonna
be happy receiving this coffee we work
from getting elected we had a meeting we
had a meeting we did in Deming he really
didn't announce literally mean word
that's literally left the other memory
turning to us in our next lesson that we
want to share with you guys is the whole
concept of doing you and being proud to
be used I just really get something that
you should be reminded of constantly
because it's so easy to lose focus on
that and someone day and yourself is the
craziness of life do you do like if it's
not making that these then don't do it
and also the whole idea of just not
having self-doubt we are always our
biggest critic so there are so many
times where you don't speak up because
your intuitive by whatever the situation
and all that stuff but when you push all
that aside at the end of the day we're
all human beings
everyone is where do you focus and
thinking about how they look how they're
acting all that stuff that they're not
even focused on like yeah you know what
I need no one else in that situation is
thinking about it there where you have
their own life let your sunshine yeah
shine this in certain climates foot
right here because quite is too easy to
actually bend for foot in that
every day right now it's a lot of work
our next tip lesson the last one the
last one is every time you cheer someone
you're actually supposed to look them in
the eye and then tickets up when is
clinking you're looking at I don't know
yeah yeah I look and then and then you
literally keep looking I mean like you
don't like you're like I feel like it's
like maybe maybe you can look away at
that just remember that here I like some
fancy function get that man a little bit
excited not even with tránsito when
you're just choosing I like iced tea or
whatever that are to add that eye
contact in general so important and just
so powerful thank you drew
so much for joining me I love your tiny
baby girl friends honestly there is no
one else I would have wanted for my
level there's a lot of fun this love I'm
really really happy that we're going to
