welcome back to slumber series which is
a series that I started way back in my
channel where I wanted you guys to feel
like you were having a sleepover with me
but I'm bringing it back in 2017 it was
a little bit of a twist I'm gonna make
it more collaborative and have
sleepovers with other youtubers who I
bring into my first episode we've got
Florida Lisbon Rebecca Black obviously
we've got snacks on debt al got some
caffeine Laurens 20-yard line
today sleepover is going to be super
chatty we're keeping it very casual for
this one I tweeted out to guys asking
what questions you have for us as far as
location goes and juicy question in
general so anything really goes in
Claudia's bed let's do this what when
did you all first me we're friends
it's been a few years in - other person
New York go true and then we realized we
were both from Chicago 2011 or 12 I know
I met you into 2013
I met Warren William Hans before I met
Claudia and they weren't too familiar
yeah yeah 104 hours Wow I made a big
cooldown while guys this past year we've
all like kind of reconnected and why
member there was one day where Rebecca
and I were like should we bring Claudia
Adams we meet Rebecca dining out we're
just like super like positive in life
like ambitious some really good quality
unlike me drops and we use Claudia and
I'm like after that there's public
I just kind of tie into that view
motivate each other if so how 100% yes I
feel so motivated and inspired when I
think about you ladies and I think we
all have very similar work habits and at
the end of the day we know why we're out
here and what our goals are I think
we're all really really good at
prioritizing whether it's help work
friendships or lets us know when to keep
each other in check we like each other
balanced so if we know when to have fun
but we know like when one of us is a
little out of control and we're clapping
because we want to work together and
yeah together and I feel like you guys I
can talk to about business I can talk to
you about when I'm frustrated about
something that has to do with whether
it's work or just personalized oh yeah
it's hard to find people that you can be
like motivated just actually have a real
substantial conversation without here
but I mean each other in check yes we do
yes we do anyways who do you think is
going to marry first
oh you're watching wedding videos last
night where are they Claudia I kinda
said a truss she was like this looks
gonna happen
Lord and I are going to get engaged the
same year because Claudia's boyfriend's
going to propose Laurens going to see
the ring and stop home to her boyfriend
be like it means you proposed to you
like four months later what do you think
a lot in my plans I'll be the thing what
to feel like I am and I'm putting this
out there I know I'm like making a band
for myself because I'm gonna get married
later like we are younger than them
I love you that's the thing I feel like
you guys go we'll go through something
first
even though we're all on the same page
as people they'll just very little bit
older I'm old enough to be a bachelor
oh so weird that's not it how's your
toys haven't seen so far good I spent
the majority of it with you probably
under love you too how was your New
Year's kiss I got I love I thought very
very heartbeat engine
every day have you ever disliked someone
the others have dated yes yes but let's
open I mean I mean I think this life is
a strong word I think we've definitely
been frustrated maybe wrong with certain
people in each other's life who I know
that and I always represent we have a
husband but like except sometimes I'm
like those those coming over and
everyone's like what do you guys need to
get out of the funk I think about first
thing I do is I have to admit to myself
that I'm in a funk yeah it's what I tell
myself which I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine
I'm fine I'll get through it when it
gets worse and all of a sudden something
will happen you're like ah you have to
tell yourself I'm not okay and like I'm
gonna work through this and I'm supposed
to get better do you have to actually
make active change so that sometimes I
admit that I'm going to funk but I don't
do anything to change it yeah do things
that make you happy which for me looks
like sugar it has to do with the people
a lot if you're sad let yourself be sad
it's going to keep toning in until you
just went out once doing that I
personally kind of have a mental list of
all the things that I know if I do that
I will feel better about myself more
content on beta d'huez its readiness to
do it the night before a day or making
my bed in the morning there's like
simple little things that I know if I do
that it will brighten my day and kind of
give me that little boost it's not like
one thing that's going to change your
life it's the small parts of every
single day
yeah let's consistently happen I think
you need to make your bed every day it's
not only make your bed one day in your
life and I can only think it's like
getting up every morning working out
maybe in your bed making your to-do list
checking it off it's a small part to add
up to greater successes that was one
thing huge lesson that we all learn in
2016 at consistency and sexy oh yeah
aspects of life how do you deal with
fake friends why do you deal with fake
friends yeah
so let me rephrase the question how do
you deal with fake or negative people
that yeah because obviously that happens
to everyone negative people for me it's
really easy for me at times to give some
the benefit of the doubt or like try to
give them a chance well I have to tell
myself they're not your problem
try try to fix them yeah lesson two
using don't let it affect you sell the
most excited
you have a bubble around you at all
times in the minute you let someone else
in your bubble they have the power to
like a hundred you a large when you
disturb yourself yeah somebody to get
you some the situation I know for
instance one time I was at an event and
like every single person there I was
just not closed to and like it was kind
of a fake weird thing but I knew that
for those two hours or whatever it was
like I wanted to not sit by myself in
the corner and I just like accepted it
and I moved on and just made the best of
the situation but then just never myself
in a situation right I think it's very
important to just stay mindful of the
situation it's okay to mentally remind
yourself okay I am going to be nice to
them every single time at an event or
party they're going to be in Queens but
I don't necessarily need to go out of my
way and Maxie announced about yeah I
mean I know other things that on to that
I agree life as I say the best thing you
can do but there is a way to exclude
yourself from a situation without being
me good advice right there yeah Holly
we've been through a lot
yeah Nazi a smoothie of eat any quality
choice very couple weeks ago you know
that weird you literally were like well
if I get my goodness yet talk about it
you think I was like ah and now we just
like Catholic living lies with our
Neutral canals on ebay they talk about
it but we had sale the smells are great
I don't even think I've ever had that
either realistic goals you guys have
from 2017 as a friend group big more
trip take more China I feel better
we have so much money on stuff and we
also have been so much time working yes
I think to solve both of those is like
to spend more time like taking time off
with each other we've been going to the
grocery for so long yeah we might do
that
allowing right now is that what it's a
hard my issue is I always want to be
available to work that is my idea where
maybe technically I don't have anything
booked in yes I'm like oh okay yeah
exactly not the Canadian opposition
comes up or Street comes up exactly like
you always keep yourself available but
if you go importing that like light goes
on hmm pretty good away for few days and
come back in Lexington
let's change is that up in Austin's
barians yeah I think that and then like
collaborating with each other more
continuing to support each other and
raise each other out because that's what
we're all about here to be read for some
youtuber yeah yes I was a bit bottle
into a two-door car wow Mike the
question is yeah I've done anything
illegal and the other their colors so
many dumb laws that we've broken that we
don't even know Gallagher diving into
abandoned property yeah sneaking out
past curfew
oh I left my bride Ohioans back in
Chicago yeah you can say yourself an
introvert or extrovert of sugar
extrovert I always thought it was like
the biggest extrovert my definitely and
in extroverted introvert right now in my
soul like I'm very extroverted body is
become much more introverted or well I
would say talkative for me when I was
super young I was really shot but since
moving out here I'd become more active
really more confident in when I was
young whereas I agree eyeliner descent
that job near a nut job you guys this is
the time to ask you see darkness
juiciest questions to each other but
with your tights lovely crushed nice
multi Michael repurposed and I also I've
never dated a token yourself yeah like
that crush type has kind of expired for
you it wasn't me when there's on that
growing up cashton Kutcher oh yeah you
know yeah that family was a magic
picture woman absolute mama sleeper me
yeah Orlando Bloom that was who I was
defenseless entire speaker be mmm-hmm I
had an already little poster on my door
that I would put lipstick on every night
before bed okay I'm about 100 right now
I'm about to one lucky right now
I had a life-size cardboard cutout of
Captain Jack Sparrow in my bedroom I had
a Justin Bieber one at one is I made a
box of a pilot I was in seventh grade
and its image and cold as the day drops
and it was hip turn handsome what's not
and why all that why are we insane let's
you want like Dan question yeah I was
your most for being friendzone doing the
friend-zoning
or Bing friendzone ohoo let's start with
doing the friend-zoning
it's called the slow food this slow
place okay not ghosting I think ghosting
is like it's pretty measures the slow
phase let me explain is when you respond
to the text
as you normally would we don't further
engage in conversation is what was more
like so much longer is very slowly he
gets boring and then what about being
from them I am so Kayla being
friend-zoned and I had a mic set and
Ella got another one my stuff I never
have an issue with it it was someone I
genuinely get along with yeah by the
thing you're not moving the front yeah I
would much rather have like a straight
male friend that might have like a weird
and they don't make it where I won't
make it weird but if you post up though
mmm my feelings finest still Thank You
kid I would get rid of it I hooked up
with yeah I read in your life for a
reason why would you want to force
anything anyways no matter I'm like why
would you I get why I think the turning
part is this really easy sometimes to
meet someone and be like oh my god
everything I want
you're right there great I mean every
time I meet someone literally right
literally and we all do it and you just
have Roberts entire idea of what it
would be like bucket act like you don't
have those feelings because we all have
them and you're just keeping yourself in
check and being like one I'm not gonna
ignore any work like oh yeah I can't do
this myself and also if they a lot a
piece of this like funny five yeah how
do you tell a boy that you like him a
little ass out Bryan I'm so up front
do you even remember that imagine my
Dharma oh I wrestled a guy Oh bad you
get to the point where your honor and
not best friends hmm you're asking with
more than friends and you didn't have to
dress it you don't slip what's going on
oh my god like this would need to happen
like this one felt like we're dating
that if it energies needed to like yeah
yeah yeah yeah started off with the like
to like basis that you can pretty much
tell us how you guys are talking at how
they're texting each other whatever
Legation sweep cities see at that point
you should be comfortable enough with
the person where you knots about it we
do have about it like I feel like an
open conversation and then obviously
like that I love you sorry Louis
come on - feel about hooking up
with a guy that one of your friends
dated or a hooked up with pen it's
wholly defensible situations like did
they like each other were they a thing
when did they hook up I'm on the go like
why did they hook up if you know someone
still cares about someone or when you
really get into test you ours and I've
never had this kind of a sense I think
what would be really weird is if someone
were to be like hey I know done it other
than that like I really like him and you
still go and do it there's yellow shoes
yeah I think at the end of the day when
it's the best friend that you're talking
about in one boy the chances of that boy
being your future husband and your life
partner it's so slim - how long and
strong your fun tip is going to do it
right here it's 99% using or is it yeah
literally yeah if you guys were to rate
me as a sleepover host 1 to 10 what
would be very serious about NAT
