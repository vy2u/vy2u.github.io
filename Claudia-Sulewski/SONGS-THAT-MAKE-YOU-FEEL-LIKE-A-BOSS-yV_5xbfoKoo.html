channel in today's video I'm going to be
talking about all the different songs
that I like to listen to when I want to
be motivated I'm working callous I'm on
my way to a meeting and in general all
of these songs just make you feel really
really great about yourself and pumped
up all of those things very very running
on treadmill materials I use Spotify so
you guys can actually just access my
entire workout playlist I'll have that
link down below I'm not going to be
talking about all the songs because we'd
be sitting here for like two hours and
before we get started I do want to
mention that I listen to a lot of
different genres when I'm working out or
just in life but the one thing that all
of these songs have in common is that
they're going to make you want to run as
fast as you can unless you're doing some
other sort of workout with you no
weights or whatever you like to do the
first song that I once mentioned is a
monster if that describes it correctly
it is the boombox cartel remix of it's
strange by Louie the child the chorus
gets super EDM but you have to listen to
the song all the way through because how
it builds up and then adds later on oh
it's so so good so in the beginning is a
little slow
nice goodie
and then it goes red oh my it's so good
if that song is a little bit too EDM and
intense for you there's another it's
strange remix that I'm obsessed with
this one is those we've in remix on a
home pronouncing it correctly
same songs are completely different just
as effective though the next song that I
want to mention is specifically for all
of my ladies out there that just want to
feel empowered and motivated this song
does it for me every single time break
the rules if you do not have this on
your workout playlist you need to add it
right now it's so good can like make me
want to run
Oh Drake is always a good idea when
creating your workout playlist my
favorite song by him is jump man I'm
sure my she does a song great mom I feel
like I've mentioned this video to you
guys in one of my videos in general this
is the type of song that like Rebecca
explained us really well in her workout
song video that's actually how this
video came about and I was inspired by
that's a shout-out do you read - she's
one of my best friends I will link her
video down below if you want to see
because she has a really good playlist
and really good recommendation the song
that I'm about to show you guys is one
of those songs where if you're driving
to a meeting or work and you're nervous
about something throw this on and you
will feel unstoppable and really really
great about yourself even have the
lyrics to like a little effed up I pick
is was talking about how she like loved
your life but hates your life because
she over works herself and party to
hearts that's not gonna relate to
everyone and I'm also not saying that my
life is like that but it's very catchy
and it just it makes you feel like a bad
bitch basically XML by K Flay
it's so good I love the fire we're going
to really change up the genre now this
song is so good it's called five hours
by deorro do I like it because of how
simple it is the build-up is so good
although it's a five minute and 30
second song this is a really great song
to sprint to if you're like on that last
bit of energy and you just want to take
it home throw this song on and see if
you can sprint for five minutes straight
it also depends really good in the car
as well what's really nice speakers so
you kind of sound like you're like in a
spaceship at this part it's so good
gets the job done a good beat to run to
definitely recommend love listening to
Kanye also this is kind of an oldie but
a goodie black skinhead
and like so breathing Artie it's so
workout it so okay - really really throw
it back I don't know I've always been so
drawn to this song but I really love
knockout by little Wayne it's really
I'll be in - yeah I feel like this song
never got the height that it deserved
maybe it did I don't know this is when
things get super different I'm not over
by Carolina liar there's a lot of
throwbacks on this playlist the reason
why I like running to this song is
because it for some reason makes me feel
like I'm in a rom-com or something at
the end of the movie like running after
the taxi that my lovers
I don't know I don't know also I think
the words just I'm not over it just kind
of like I'm not oh we just work out like
I'm going to continue to look what movie
used this song
kind of thinking with that sort of theme
dirty little secrets the all-american
rejects actually I do remember here in
this song and John Haeger must die this
song
this song I'll even remember how I found
this song and it's very different the
build-up of this song is very strong and
towards the end you feel like you are
literally running in like an action
movie like in transformers or something
and it starts off very slow in the
beginning like you have a lot of silent
moment but it just it builds up and it's
so good so this is and so we go down by
rule ready so if you like you can
actually be since right here flawless
women by Beyonce obviously plastic
laughing to be honest I actually
finished the list that I created for
this video but I'm still going because
there are so many songs on here gangsta
Cattleya has will roll eight-track remix
yeah yeah skip a little bit

video of course I have so many more on
