are doing a favourites obsessions video
I'm gonna be talking about different
products that I've been loving as well
as a fun little announcement thing I'm
so excited
also if you're new to my channel be sure
to subscribe hit that Bella notification
so you know every single time I upload a
new video without further ado let's get
into it oh I feel like I just need to
mention the bench
I bought a wasabi green bench for my
apartment and I'm kind of freaking out
cuz it's a lot of color and clearly I
mean we're still a little afraid of it
my first spring favorite is so so
exciting because I can call it mine it's
a thing it's a thing that I burst and
created and made for you guys how cute
is this how cute is this you guys I
received the lovely opportunity to team
up with real style who's sponsoring this
video to create a subscription box for
you guys it's gonna be seasonal so I
also will have a summer one for you guys
but it's like what like this this right
here so on brand I helped create the
look of the box everything that's inside
the box before I show you guys what's
actually in the box the value of it is a
hundred dollars but it is only 25
dollars it's available to purchase and
ship in North America I'm excited to
have my own subscription box because I
just love the concept you get to try out
a bunch of different products and you're
not committed to some full-size stuff so
you can really just play around when you
first open it up you have a little menu
card and it says what each product does
all the details I asked if we can add
some little cute pink wormies in there
so you're gonna have a little bit of
that in there the first product in here
is the red earth secret potion
illuminating skin fluid in the shade
pearl this might be my favorite product
in here because a it's such a great size
the packaging is so cute it's a super
hydrating illuminating fluid with
antioxidants and conditioning agents
that create radiance on the face and
body it's got a nice matte finish and it
says OMG this it's just it's so
aesthetic you know on the box it says to
highlight features apply to face and
duck Lata's use blended with foundation
or moisturizer for a subtle sheen look
shake well before each use I've
definitely used this to dab it just on
my
highlighting points if I'm not wearing
any makeup but my favorite way is to
just mix this into my foundation to give
my face and all over glow it smells so
good it smells like roses like it's very
calming and fresh smelling pearl is the
perfect way to describe it it's got such
a pretty Sheen to it and it's not
glittery or chunky at all so you'll get
one of those
the next product in here is the derma e
sun protection mineral powder SPF 30 now
that summer is creeping up you're
spending more time outside Sun is
getting hotter it is so so important to
wear SPF this oil-free powder protects
your skin from UVA and UVB rays it's
also translucent so works with any skin
type and I love the size of it it's a
perfect little to go product because you
have the built in brush if you just dab
it you'll see products sort of fall out
and you just kind of buff it into your
skin in a circular motion and it'll
obviously help to set your makeup keep
it in place
keep your face matte all those things
the key ingredients in here are green
tea chamomile and vitamin E you will
also be receiving this little gift code
it is $15 off of hum nutrition which you
guys know is my favorite vitamin and
supplement brand it's never too late to
be taking care of your insides if you've
never used Tom before you can easily
just take their quiz online you will be
asked different questions you create
your own little profile and a personal
registered dietitian will review your
answers and recommends based on those
answers what you should get or you can
just choose your own vitamins which is
what I do the fact that all this is 25
dollars and this is already knocking out
15 like you are getting so much bang for
your buck adding this in was like a
no-brainer for me I love honey you also
be getting a travel size of the Vita
Liberata body blur instant HD skin
finish in latte and I've definitely
talked about this a lot it is one of my
go-to products this is what the
full-size product looks like if you
recognize that and you guys will be
getting this one I mean literally on the
package it says body blur the original
Instagram filter in a tube so it's like
a skin perfecting a body makeup product
it adds an instant bronze to your skin
it smooths out your imperfections makes
you look glowing you are you're a
glowing goddess with this it
completely natural it's vegan it's
cruelty-free and also you can just wash
it right off this stuff is so good so
through one of those in there next up
I've also added the Tarte lip sculptor
lip gloss and lipstick so it's a
two-in-one long-wearing product you've
got a satin lipstick on one end and a
super pigmented lip gloss on the other
both sides are so so pigmented that I
personally will just wear them alone
whether I'm choosing like a lip gloss
day we're having a lipstick moment the
color that I chose for you guys was Jam
because it's super super natural so many
of these products are so great for
on-the-go that's kind of the reoccurring
theme here but yeah I am very very
obsessed with this so you'll get that I
want to throw in a hair product and this
is by far one of my favorite hair
products ever it is the way texturizing
hairspray it's basically if like hair
spray and dry shampoo had a baby it's
very lightweight it basically just
builds texture and volume to your hair
without weighing it down it's packed
with volcanic minerals to observe oil
and refresh the hair great to use as a
styling product after you dried your
hair and you want that finishing touch
I'm in love with this stuff it's so good
we also edit in the cover effects
blurring primer it's a silky smooth
primer that instantly minimizes the look
of your pores fine lines any like
unwanted texture on your face it works
as a great retouching bomb if you want
to put it on throughout the day or just
wear it alone for like that silky smooth
look so you get a cute little sample of
that we also threw in too little cover
effects illuminating primers as well so
you get two little samples of that that
is everything that I picked out for my
little subscription box it's so I just
can't get over how cute it is if you
guys want to purchase your own then just
go to the link in my description box
I'll link it for you guys once again it
is literally only $25 ah we love a
bargain we love a good deal next up we
have a body product and it's from Vita
Liberata which is the same brand from
the little body blur product this is
newer
I believe you can purchase it now it's
their invisi foaming tan water so
it's just a moose self-tanner but as you
can see it's clear and liquidy I've
never seen another tanning company do
this before or have a similar product to
this so I was so excited and intrigued
with this one and it's wonderful and
I'll tell you why there are definitely
days and moments where I want to
self-tan my body but I forget to do it
the night before so I do it during the
day and then I'm like freaking out
making sure I don't sweat and I don't
get any of the self-tanner like on my
clothes and stuff this is the answer to
that problem it came with this cute
little golden mint so love that we've
got some makeup favorites the first one
is a new bronzer which I'm so excited
about because I'm such a benefit hoola
girl like it is my all-time favorite
bronzer it's the only one that I've used
for so many years but this one is
replacing it because it's so good
definitely more pricier because it is
Marc Jacobs but this bronzer is unreal
you guys look I can already smell it
cracking it open it smells like coconuts
oh what's it called let me tell you
Omega bronze coconut perfect tan limited
edition bronzer if you see this get your
hands on it it smells so good but and
also I just love this size of it like
look at this puppy it is huge it's also
matte so it doesn't have any sort of
shimmer or sheen to it which I
personally like because I already go so
crazy with like highlighter I'd rather
have like a matte bronzer I've got a
lipstick favourite I've been wearing
this non-stop literally every single day
when I wear makeup
it's from colour-pop it is their
carousel lipstick I've been all about
lipsticks that have like that slight
orange peachy tone to it
crazy pigmented doesn't run anywhere
sits on your lips since that sounds so
weird I'm in love with this lipstick
it's my favorite also from colour-pop I
have these two products that I've been
wearing pretty much yeah every single
time I do my makeup as well reading this
earlier today as I planned this video I
realized that they are they're super
shock cheek pearlized products which
leads me to believe that these go on
your cheeks but I just can't imagine
that being true I mean I guess it could
be a highlighter maybe it's a
highlighter oh my god these are
definitely highlighters I've been using
them as
shadows but I mean you can just you can
put this wherever but I have the shades
frosted and wisp one is a little bit
more bronze the other is a little bit
more golden and I've been loving just
putting these alone all over my lids it
adds such a pretty glowy look to my eyes
it makes them pop it makes them look so
awake and youthful and I love it and I
literally just apply it with like the
pout of my finger and I just Pat it on
my eyes it's such a fun time next up
we've got I guess like a skin care
product or tool that's a good word it's
by skin Jim and yes I keep it in the
original packaging just to like keep it
sanitized cuz I wipe it down every time
I use it and I throw it back in here
also because I store it in my freezer
with my food so I'm sure you guys have
seen these before online oh it still
holds releases tension and activates
blood circulation stimulates collagen
and improve skin Ellis Ellis this elf I
can't say that word elasticity reduces
puffiness and wrinkles promotes
lymphatic drainage eliminates toxins it
does so many things I love doing this in
the morning I keep it in the freezer
because that helps to really deep Huff
like especially under your eyes and it
just cools your whole face every motion
should go towards your ears and then
you've got the little one for your eyes
it's such a great time you guys there's
so many benefits to it but also it's
just so therapeutic and it's become like
a routine and it just feels so good like
invigorates and wakes up your face and
I've just been loving it my next
favorite is a fashion favorite and they
are a pair of boots I just I I am
genuinely so pissed at myself for taking
so long to buy myself a pair of platform
Doc Martens I don't know what was like
thinking 5 stars 10 out of 10 I bought
these for Coachella and I decided to
break them in at Coachella which you
would think is a bad idea because these
are kind of known for being super stiff
when you first buy them and the leather
has to really kind of melt into your
foot and shape with your foot but I was
very very smart and careful I wrapped my
feet up I bandaged everything up I wore
double socks I did the whole thing and
then ever since after Coachella now I
can just single sock it
and I've traveled in these I've got the
airport I wear them all the time I love
them all so you've got the zipper going
on on the side so you don't even have to
worry about like redoing the shoelaces
they rock my world before we get into
music favorites I have one movie
favorites I think I want to start
incorporating that and it's hunt for the
welder people my friend Becca
recommended it to me and I had so much
fun watching that movie the humor in
this movie is so good in spot-on
it's so blunt if you're committed and
you're sitting down you're watching it
oh my god it is such a funny movie it's
so cute I love the main character I want
to adopt him and just have him with me
he's just this cute oh my god let's get
into music favorites I'm going to play
them off my phone
like I normally do I don't know why I
announce that my first favorite is by
Maisy Peters it's called worst of you
I've been playing it so often it's
definitely on the girlier side but it's
so catchy you're welcome you're you're
gonna hear this song put into your
playlist and listen to it at least ten
times a day
so give me your six days any reason to
stay falling a similar sort of vibe
theme I had a huge huge phase with this
song it's called strangers by Sigrid I
don't know how I don't I think I friends
I'm wrong oh so catchy
Valli buy perfume genius it makes me
want to cry but like in a happy way you
know
the way that this song just progresses
and builds it's just it's so beautiful
listen to this song while you're
watching this sunset or you're looking
out at some pretty high point view
whatever and you'll just he'll be
feeling a lot of feelings is where I'm
trying to get it lastly I want to show
you guys bodies by car seat headrests I
definitely mentioned one of their songs
in my last favorites but this song is
crazy

running on the tunnel

springtime favorites I hope you guys
