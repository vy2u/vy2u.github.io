today's video is going to be a fashion
haul some are trying long summer fashion
trying haul collective crap collective
southern China click the first store
that I went to was Urban Outfitters
so for starters I got this hat it's kind
of like a topi color and it's so cool
because it's made out of this like satin
material this is what it looks like on
and yeah I'm really excited to wear this
with clothes that are black and white
and everything in between
next up I got this little denim skort
which caught my eye immediately it is so
cute it's got like buttons going up and
down front and they're just little
shorts on the back next up I got this
really really cute black cotton jumper
it just looks like a real clean black
shirt on top and then it cinches it at
the waist with a little tie and there's
cute little black shorts and it's
adorable I got a pair of jeans and these
are so freakin cute I love the fit of
them you're like a dark grey color and
they're kind of like moto jeans so we've
got different stitching going across and
they just give off a really cool badass
pod I'm sensing some
hi I was correct the last thing that I
got from Urban Outfitters was this
little choker necklace I am in love with
this thing I love how the front of it
has these two little clasps that just
connect together definitely appreciate
this so the next store that I went to
was Nasty Gal and I got a whole lot of
things from Nasty Gal so prepare
yourself oh I also forgot I got this
shirt from Urban Outfitters
it's tie-dye and pink and blue and green
and it's fun I got this little black
leather backpack and I'm mostly gonna be
using this for traveling like when I'm
flying or I need to pack up lots of
things were like shoots or something
yeah I thought it was a really cute just
simple black leather backpack I also got
a smaller purse and the second I saw
this purse I thought of my mom because
she loves her little fringes and leather
bags and stuff I think it's just gonna
be really cute for the summertime I
don't have any purses like this that's a
total lie I have two bags of edges on
them but still very neat and I like it
next up I went a little ham on
sunglasses I bought four couldn't decide
between any of them so I got all of them
the first pair is super cute they're
from the brand key they're like a trophy
brown color and they have a huge cat eye
shape I wore these out today and I'm so
obsessed with them I think they look so
cool so I'm really really excited about
cheese next up I got this black pair and
there's kind of a story behind these so
Jack one of my roommates owns a pair
just like this and
always like drives around with them and
I wanted to buy these because not only
do they remind me of him so much but
also I want these to be like my driving
glasses so the next pair is also from
key and these are super reflective and
bug eye looking they're ginormous but I
thought they were cool because it B
frames are clear and like I said the
reflective lenses across you can't look
deep into my soul and last but not least
I got a pair from the brand is Spitfire
and these sunglasses are just impeccable
this is what they look like on and the
lenses are so cool because they're like
cat eye shape so they pop out of the
frame and I just saw these are really
really cute detail that's the large bag
let's see what do we have in here my
next item of purchase would be this
little black skirt I just fell in love
with the shape so much because on the
side it's got a little bit of pleating
and it goes a little shorter so it gives
it a nice little edgy vibe and also the
material of it it's very thick and you
could just tell it's very high quality
next up I got this crop top and I
believe it was on sale
it looks like this and I am so in love
with this pattern I think it looks so
cool it's kind of a cool shape because
it goes circular and then it goes into
like a little halter top so it almost
looks like a little cropped apron thing
almost is that weird is it cool
definitely wearing this to VidCon during
we have in here next up I got a jumpsuit
and this was a very big deal for me
because I've been looking for
like the perfect black jumpsuit for so
long but I finally found one that fits
me and it's really really nice because
at the top it's got a high neckline with
low cuts and then also you can see some
of the back so it just has a really
really flattering top and then it simply
just has a long pants on the bottom what
a week and lastly I got this super
casual dark grey t-shirt dress it's got
a really nice flowy fit to it so it
looks a little bit more fancier than
just like a straight cut shirt but I
actually will be wearing this during the
daytime at VidCon with some really
awesome boots but I actually wore my
last video but I don't want to give it
all away yeah I'm really excited about
that is it
we're nice to go next up we got some
brandy melville stuff what are we
looking back at this there were
definitely a few pieces that I forgot
that I bought or I must have
accidentally bought but I kind of just
ran in there and was like this is cute
this is cute okay let's buy it
the first thing in here is this little
grey shirt and I thought the top of it
was so cute it kinda reminds me like a
football jersey in some sort of way yeah
so there's that and then I got two of
the same shirt and the reason why is
because I love the cut of these shirts
if you guys see them every level I
highly recommend the length of them is
so perfect because it's a little shorter
but it doesn't show your
if you're wearing low-cut jeans so it's
super super flattering I've got this
slight of gray one it's got like stripes
on it kind of a so got this darker
striped one next up I got this black
little tank top and it's just got little
straps that go across the top yeah it's
pretty simple but definitely a nice
solid crop top so this is where my
memory gets a little blurry I don't
remember buying this shirt but I mean
honestly it's not that bad it's just
this little light pink t-shirt the
collar of it
kind of reminds me of like little PJ
shirts in a way it's got like this
little trim it has a very girly innocent
vibe to it and I'm I'm diggin it what a
week then I got one rest thing and this
is just one of their cropped hoodies I
love the cut of these this is my third
one that I have this one's just simple
and black and it says New York on it
that's the entirety of this thing I just
love the shape of it so I had to buy it
next up I went to pax on which I haven't
been there in so long but I realized how
much I love their jeans
I actually own a lot of jeans because
they're very comfortable they fit me
very well these are just all black
skinny jeans they've got the double
zippers on the top there are little
wrinkly because I wore them last night
but they are so comfortable they've got
like the stretchy softest material and
so so happy with these oh my gosh I'm
already on my last store I feel like
this home by so fast guys I'm getting up
I was having so much fun filming what a
week lastly I'm to Topshop and I just
got two things not very fun first thing
is this little skirt so I'll be wearing
this at VidCon as well for one of my day
outfits but it's just got blue little
flowers on it and this really cute like
white detail right here puts out looking
uneven bottom and I totally feel it I
don't know where this new vocabulary is
coming from like why am I saying I dig
it I feel it I don't sorry
and then lastly I got this little white
flowy top I actually will be wearing
these together yes yes I am nothing
really special about this one but I just
really like the way that it fits
it's definitely got more of a fancier
cut to it which I appreciate because I
will be getting a lot of use out of this
so that is it for my haul I I came to
explain how upset I am that I finished
this already it went by so fast
alright well time for the outro thank
you for watching and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
