going to be doing a little haul in a
little try on haul in summer haul lots
of summery things yeah yeah that's I
don't really need to pick up anything
else to say so let's get into it I guess
usually I fill my hauls by the store
brand so I'll start off with like here
are my Urban Outfitters things here my
bla bla instead I'm going to organize
this video in categories we're going to
start off with shoes first the first few
pairs are pretty much the same thing but
not really the same thing but like
they're the same thing I can deduce a
lot of things that I like maybe we have
been super into platforms because they
are not only super comfortable but also
love convincing people that I'm taller
than I actually am so both of these are
from Topshop they've got a huge like 2
or 3 and tri platform this espadrille
are these espadrilles I don't really
know what I'm talking about they've got
a really pretty bow detail on the top so
I got them in black as well as this
little checkered picnic pattern I
thought things would be super cute my
style is so so simple so I love just
adding little twists sticking with a
platform theme I also have these that I
purchased I think a week ago two weeks
ago these are actually my first pair of
the collaboration with Puma and Rihanna
they're so freaking cute they've got the
platform dummy bottom and these give me
like slight ballerina vibes because of
these thick laces you wrap them across
on your ankle after we love the color of
these I'm super into nude and I love the
little spell at the top we're definitely
girly but still 40 the next fairy tales
that I want to show you guys are
actually not that new for me but I've
started to wear them a lot more recently
I may even have shown these to guys I'm
not sure but these are from revolve by
the brand Rey RA Yee these are really
great for like cropped jeans any dresses
and skirts
honestly shorts it's such a great way to
spice up an outfit and make it look like
a little older but still obviously fun
and fashionable so love them so much I
am showing you guys so many pairs of
shoes but I just want to get them out of
the way I've got one last pair and love
sandals I love slide on these have more
like a Birkenstocks vibe which honestly
I rocked back in like sixth grade for
someone who wears blue jeans and a white
v-neck way to opt in these are a really
great way to kind of add a little
ha it's my office and they're very very
comfortable so you can get these I
literally purchases like a few days ago
you can still get them jumping real
quick into accessories I have one purse
that I want to show you guys it's Bible
I almost knocked this over that would
have sucked this little bag is by the
brand Cara definitely a little bit more
pricey I got it from Barney's but
honestly what I love about it is a the
color all about the nude love the size
of it also there's like a little
magnetic pocket right here my phone just
perfectly sits in there the way that the
straps are attached the bag just like
kind of blaze in front of your body like
that and so it's just like perfect
having your phone right there and it's
super cute I just know that I'm going to
be using this all the time this summer
it's such a great everyday bag we've got
two sunglasses and these are going to
brand pervert I was very very impressed
with all the glasses that they have
because they're all about like $40 which
is such a great price for high quality
sunglasses that you're going to wear a
bunch I got these black ones that have
silver frames and I just love the shape
of the glasses and yes that is that and
then also I'm loving the trend of super
bright like plastic glasses I want to
show you guys the red ones but I don't
know where they went
I basically just got the same pair in
different colors I'm guilty I do this a
lot so here I am admitting that I also
have them in blue I think these are just
so much fun and the fun little graphic
tee and some mom jeans and sneakers
whatever throw these on you're good to
go
honestly my keys on my head as a
headband right now let's jump into some
clothing this is obviously going to be a
try on haul so most of it will be video
some of it will be photos of me wearing
some of the stuff we're going to get
into jeans pants in general forewarning
I've got a lot to show you guys but I
recently just found so many jeans that
fit me so well I finally like crack the
code reclamation is probably my favorite
store in the entire world they recently
came out with their own denim they used
to just sell like vintage Levi's and
stuff but now they make their own denim
and they fit so well holy crap like oh
my god so the first pair I want to show
you guys is they're I think they're
called skinny French jeans these are
light blue so the
just fit the butt really well and I
found this stream in the back super
interesting there's just like a line
that goes all the way down and they just
have a very like fitted but vintage vibe
and I'm so so excited about these kind
of a similar fit same company I got
these which have a line going all the
way down the front and down the back
which I've seen honestly everywhere I
think it's such a cute very simple added
detail to an outfit super cute
a lot of this is from Reformation next
up I want to show you guys two pants I
wore for fourth of July and this is kind
of going with the whole like Hamptons
beachy I don't care but I still look
preppy and girly type like these are
just super lightweight long pants and
they kind of look like pajama pants for
those two towns like beach pants utterly
now I wore them a little bit more higher
waisted with these cute little black
crop top and absolutely love that look
and I definitely know that I'll be able
to wear these with a bunch this summer
next up I got a pair of Levi's vintage
jeans I purchased these at the vintage
Reformation store on Melrose I have been
on the hunt for the perfect baggy like
denim short look but every time I shop I
always like forget to try on a bigger
size and see how it looks
anyways I found a pair that looks really
great I love how loose they are around
the sides but they still kind of you
know hold up to my waist and so they
look like this they honestly just look
super simple but yeah when you guys see
the Tryon shot they're just like a
little looser on me more relaxed fit
I've got one more pair of denim jeans
and these are pretty similar to what
I've been showing you guys but it's a
different cut it's more flared on the
bottom just show you guys the different
types of genes that Reformation sells
but a superlight wash but they just go
out at the bottom these are super cute
with keels and booties and platform the
first time I wore these out everyone was
like whoa your jeans fit you so well
like those look so good that's dad I've
got a few pairs of pants that I got some
Topshop and both of them are very
different styles but honestly like but
even I don't have a style I just like to
get things that I like and usually
doesn't work out so I found these pans
and
kind of go with the whole like sporty
vibe that's out here in Los Angeles
where everyone's wearing like sweat
pants or army pants or like whatever
these are pretty much like skinny snow
pants it is like the way that I'm
describing them but they're navy blue
the bottoms unzip and then on the back
they have this super cool like blue line
red details make it a night out look
done easy now completely going on the
opposite side of the spectrum I got
these like dark green pants I guess
they're like a cargo material but they
have like a little tie at the waist it
just got a straight cut and I think
these will be really cute with some
boots or something running well so I got
those those are also from Topshop going
into shirt I have been so obsessed with
like graphic tees I just left tucking
them in and just feeling comfortable and
like relaxed and loose and whatever it's
either that or it's just like barely a
shirt which I will talk about this one
later firstly I want to show you guys
this shirt I got it from Urban
Outfitters online but it just says
friends the TV show I literally wore
this with like black skinny jeans a
black leather jacket black boots and
made it like a night out look and wore
that for Rebecca's birthday so like it's
very easy to make sure it's like this
look edgy and cool and whatever another
shirt that I want to show you guys
it's from Topshop and it just says girls
girls girls I really like it also I love
pops of red so the strips that I pulled
out earlier I received so many questions
and comments about this when I
instagrammed it or it out once and
literally this good this is a shirt guys
I swear it's from the brand our um I
it's purposely supposed to be like tight
on your chest which I don't really have
boobs so for me this is a pretty
exciting night because it kind of made
me look like I had boobs
I think the simplistic modern vibe of it
made it not look as risque as like other
tops definitely make you look and also
I'm obsessed with the nude you guys know
next up I got a flannel from Topshop and
I really like the color of this one it's
like a cool tone dark green and then the
bottom is super frayed and ripped up has
off the shoulder a little bit not really
care next up I've got two little dresses
from Remy
I want to show you guys that this one is
red it cuts across and then wraps around
and you just tie it to the side and I
just love this color and the shape of it
super flattering and it's great for any
sort of fancier occasion during summer
and then also I got this black one which
yet again I can't really show you if you
have to like tie these things across but
once you do it similar vibe but I feel
like I can get so many uses out of a
cute small little summary black dress
