my school supplies haul and I also
wanted to update you guys a little bit
on where I've been what I've been doing
why have I not posted a video in like 14
days or something crazy like that and
also what's going to be going on in the
future
so I didn't want to say I apologize
thank you guys for being so patient with
me but towards the end of summer time I
just had a lot of school work to do for
the summer I had exactly 100 pages of
notes to complete I had maps to memorize
three books to read an essay to write on
one of the books and I think that's it
but me being the procrastinator that I
am I decided to save it to the last
minute so I just had so much to do in a
short amount of time because I wanted to
finish all of my school work before I
went to beautycon so last week I went to
LA for like five days to go to beauty
con and he was very fun and I literally
came back the night before the first day
of school which was this Monday and
today is Wednesday morning and I'm
filming this before school if I seem
tired or sad or sickly or anything it's
because I have morning voice and I'm
running on like four hours of sleep so
yeah I'm filming this on Wednesday
so I just wanted you guys to know that I
didn't like not want to post any videos
or anything I've just been very stressed
out and busy also I wanted to let you
guys know that next week on Tuesday I'm
actually flying out to New York and I'm
going to be there for two weeks so I
will explain more about that in a future
video but I just wanted to let you guys
know that if I continue to kind of be
absent on YouTube it's because I'm going
to be in New York for two weeks and then
when I come back I'm gonna be super
behind at school so I'm just gonna be
working on catching up and stuff so
right now it's just such a bad time for
me but I promise once all of this is
over
and my schedule kind of you know sets in
to like a regular pace and stuff then I
would definitely get back into making
videos because I have so many ideas for
you guys but I just have so much going
on so I just wanted to update you guys
on that and yeah let us get started on
my school supplies haul for those of you
who have seen my past school supply
videos before then you guys would know
that I like to have a theme when I buy
things I don't know why I just like to
have everything match and I basically
went with the same theme as I did last
year which is just cooler colors like
blue green and a little bit of purple
I'm gonna start by showing guys my
binders because I normally use binders
or other than folders so first off I
have this one it's a 1.5 inch binder and
it has this pattern and it looks like
this also I got this binder right here
which is like a turquoise color and by
the way this is my favorite brand
the heavy duty OneTouch binders because
they have like a little black thing
right here that opens it and I just find
that these last really really long they
don't rip or anything so I like this
brand and binders of lots then I also
got this five star white one it's
probably gonna get really dirty but it
looks cute I don't know uh-huh it's only
one-inch so I think I'm gonna use it for
my Spanish class but it just has a
folder I just have one more binder and
this one is a one and a half inch so
it's very big and this is for my
chemistry class now I couldn't find any
folders at Target that I liked and match
to my theme so I was very upset but I
found this folder from last year and I
just wanted to show it to you guys
because these are literally the best
folders in the entire world they do not
rip and they're just so convenient and
perfect they're by five sorry they look
like this and they're like the four
pocket folders so it has
poor pockets and these last all year I
mean this is from last year and it's a
perfect condition so I'm definitely
gonna use it this year as well so I'll
have to go back to like a different
target or something but I'm gonna buy
probably a lot of these to like put into
my binders and stuff then I also got two
notebooks because I could not find any
so I so need to get more of those but I
just got a dark purple one and I also
got this turquoise pot it's like a weird
material I don't know it's like
cardboard or something I don't know but
yeah it feels cool I also decided to use
the same pencil case as I did last year
because I really like it and it's just
simple it's black I also got it from
Target but I got this in me cosmetic
aisle so it's really a makeup bag but I
like it because it's black and then it
just has like neon teal in the inside so
it goes with my theme and I also still
have some markers from last year so I
didn't repurchase them they're like the
little markers that teachers used to use
in elementary school to grade papers and
then I also just have some white outs
now for the fun little supplies I got
these binder clips they are super cute
they're like polkadot and striped and
green and blue and I'm pretty sure I got
these last year or two next up I got
some paper clips and these are just
black and white then I also got these
filing tabs and these things are amazing
if you guys have never tried using them
I highly recommend it I always use these
when I'm reading books for a certain
class or especially for history when I'm
taking notes and stuff they're basically
just sticky little tabs that you can
just put on your books and pages and
stuff so these are a little bit wider
and bigger so you can write things
across them and then these are smaller
so I use these all the time and I
definitely recommend them and then also
I got some pencils and pens so I went
with the paper mint Paper Mate
mechanical pencils they just looked like
this and then also I got the Paper Mate
now smoother ink pens so I have very
high expectations for these I love
your pens so I got these then I also got
some loose-leaf paper and every time I
buy the loose leaf paper I always get
the reinforced kind where it just has
like a plastic shield where the holes
are so they don't like rip when you put
them into buyers and stuff since I do
use a lot of binders also I had to get
some sheet protectors they're just
plastic little covers for one of my
classes and then lastly I have these
index dividers with pockets it's perfect
because they're not only pockets but
they also defy you know your sheets into
different categories if you do finders
so I have that and that is everything
that I bought at Target for my school
year I apologize if I seem sad or sickly
or anything I just had no time to film
yesterday and I want to film this video
in the morning before school because I
have to put everything into the binders
and stuff I'm just really tired so
that's it for today's video
and I will talk to you guys later bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
