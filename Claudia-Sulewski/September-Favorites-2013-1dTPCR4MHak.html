you guys my September favorites video so
I'm going to be talking about a few of
the makeup and hair and fashion
favorites that I've been loving as well
as some random ones the month of
September was definitely a rollercoaster
for me
there were amazing high points and they
were very low and stressful points a lot
of you guys know I went to a New York
Fashion Week for the first time in my
life this month it was an amazing
experience and I will definitely
remember it for the rest of my life but
since I did miss two weeks of school I'm
actually still behind in a bunch of
choices and stuff that I have to retake
so I've just been very busy and working
very hard on schoolwork this month as
well as things for my youtube channel
so overall it's just been a crazy hectic
month but I did have a lot of fun so I'm
gonna start by show you guys my favorite
beauty products of September also if you
guys like my makeup in today's video I'm
actually in the process of filming might
get ready with me homecoming video so I
just finished my makeup and I'm gonna be
doing my hair afterwards which explains
why it looks all messy and gross but
yeah I'll have that video coming up soon
so stay tuned for that one so first I'm
gonna start out with the lip products
that I've been loving this month so I'm
actually all from Mac I've got two
lipsticks and two lip liners so starting
out with the lip liners I have the lip
liner in the shade magenta which is just
like a bright magenta color and the next
slider that I've been loving is the one
in currants which is like a dark dark
dark kind of vampire red like cranberry
color and it's really really pretty for
this time of year I like to wear both of
these liners underneath this lipstick
from Mac it's in the shade of rebel and
it's just like a dark purple lipstick
and it's so pretty like I wear this to
school that's so much I love it then my
next favorite lipstick is in the shade
Ruby woo which is like a perfect classic
red for anyone it's got a velvet finish
to it so it's not shiny it's more matte
which I think looks very pretty so I've
actually been wearing this a lot as well
my next favorite is a foundation and
this is the Maybelline
means shine free Foundation which comes
in a stick form so it looks like this
it's got like a lighter shade on the
inside and then a darker one on the
outside and I'm in the shade of buff
beige which exactly fits my skintone
it's actually crazy like it looks like
I'm not putting anything on because
that's how perfectly it matches me I
actually found out about this foundation
while I was in New York on my Maybelline
and style hell shoot because the makeup
artist was using this foundation with
this brush which is the Mac 109 contour
brush and basically you just rub it on
your face and you buff it in and it just
looks really good so I've been really
liking these two products to cover up my
acne and then for powder I've been
really liking the benefit hello flawless
powder which looks like this I think
this is really good for on-the-go and
stuff and I also just really like how it
mattifies my skin and keeps it very soft
feeling throughout the day and my next
favorite is also a benefit face product
and this is the rocket aura blush which
is their newest one and I really like
the shade of this one normally I stay
away from like sparkly and shimmery
blushes but this one is just very subtle
it has very fine glitters in it
and I like it because it's like a light
pink with a little bit of like gold in
it so it's a little different from what
I normally wear and I just think it's
very pretty I'm wearing it on my cheeks
right now so yeah I've been really
liking this blush then my last makeup
favourite is the urban decay 24/7
waterproof liquid liner you guys know
that I was meaning to buy a black liquid
liner for the longest time and I finally
got it while I was in New York so I've
been really really liking this one it
comes out like this it's like a little
brush it was a little hard to use at
first because it's such a little like
flimsy brush but it stays on all day
since it's waterproof and it never like
moves around or anything so I really
like it and this is in the shade
perversion which is like the darkest and
blackest black they have next I've got
two hair favorites for the month of
September which they're basically like
the same thing kind of but they are the
main and tail shampoo and conditioner I
got these because
smeg a makeup here on YouTube did a
review on these shampoo and she's
talking about how much she loves it so I
decided to try it out I really really do
like them I do feel like it makes my
hair feel like thicker and give it more
kind of like texture and stuff so yeah
I'm very happy about these and I'm also
trying to grow up my hair a little
longer so I think this really helps with
that and I also got the big bottles
because I knew that I was going to it
like these a lot my camera just died is
so sorry the position changed but my
next favorite has to do with kind of
fashion and accessories and it is the
Marc by Marc Jacobs iPhone wallet I
think that's what it's called
I'm pretty sure I got this during the
summertime so I've had this wallet for a
fairly long time and I am just obsessed
with it I use it everywhere I go so
starting with the outside it looks like
this it's in the shade cement which
matches my other bag that I showed you
guys in my other favorites video but it
just opens up by zipper when you open it
up it looks like this so it's called the
iPhone wallet because you can store your
iPhone in here so as you guys can see if
it's perfectly in there and then you can
just zip it up so this is very
convenient I love using this wallet as a
clutch because it carries pretty much
everything I need like all my essentials
and you can also fit like a lipgloss in
here as well so I really like how you
can fit your phone in there so if you
just want to you know use it as like a
little wristlet but also you've got card
slots right here and one for your ID or
driver's license right here which
normally I have there but it took it out
and then over here you've got this
little pocket behind the card slots and
then you also have a zipper pocket which
I like to keep like change in here and
then you have another pocket so you
literally have like three different
pockets behind these card holders which
is amazing because you can fit so many
things like receipts blah blah and in
the biggest one I keep this little
mirror from tweezerman which is also one
of my favorites for this month because
it just goes everywhere with me it's
like unbreakable or something so it
won't crack which is really nice and
it's like the size of you know like a
credit
so that fits perfectly in there and I
just take this everywhere with me and I
really like it my next fashion favorite
is this coat from Free People and I've
only been able to wear it like a few
times because it's not that cold yet but
I know that I'm gonna be wearing this
jacket like crazy especially during the
winter time but oh my god guys look at
this yeah I know
so it's from Free People it's like a
kind of grungy like stone wash looking
army green color and as you can see the
sleeves have this amazing like detailing
on it with beads and whatever else is on
here I can't even explain it it's very
hard to show you guys what it looks like
now so I'll put in a clip of me wearing
it but I love this jacket it's just very
big and oversized I got this in a size
extra small so if you guys do plan on
purchasing it online or something I
definitely recommend going for the extra
small because it runs big then I've just
got two random favorites which both have
to do with drinking actually the first
one is my favorite tee of the month
which is the yogi vanilla spice perfect
energy tea I just really like the yogi
brand as you guys can tell I completely
like believe in all the things that they
say that they do like this is energize
the body and focuses the mind so that's
why I got it because I was so stressed
with homework I was like hey this is
gonna make my mind focus well I do
homework so I got it but actually this
tea gives me so much energy it's insane
each tea bag contains approximately 80
milligrams of caffeine as compared to
approximately 90 milligrams in an 8
ounce cup of coffee so this has got a
lot of caffeine in it which really helps
to keep me awake while I'm doing
homework and stuff so I really like this
and also I really like getting my
caffeine from tea rather than coffee
just because I like the taste of tea
better I guess and I mean tea has like
no calories as well which is nice so I
definitely recommend this if you guys
ever need to stay up and study or
something and you need caffeine or in
the morning I normally
get when I could do homework though I've
been drinking this like crazy and then
my next favorite is the water bottle
that I've been using which looks like
this I decided to fill it up for you
guys so you can get the whole visual
experience but basically it's just this
plastic clear water bottle that I got
from hot look or hoot look I'm not
really sure what brand it was it was
like less than ten dollars but I'm sure
you can find these anywhere so basically
it's just a water bottle and then it has
this little like compartment on the
inside that kind of filters through and
you can just put whatever fruit you want
in there so I just put frozen fruit and
then I fill the rest up with water and
it's just a fun way to spice up your
water because throughout the school day
I never like have the desire to drink
water cuz it just doesn't have taste but
I noticed that when I drink flavored
like fruit water I want to drink water
all the time so it like motivates me to
drink more water which is nice and of
course it tastes amazing so you could
really put like anything in here you
could put like cucumbers mint fruit you
can do tea with like lemons you can do
anything so this is really fun and that
actually concludes all my favorites for
this month I was trying to think of
music favorites and I didn't really find
any new music this month I guess I just
didn't really have time to sit down and
relax and try to find new music that I
like because I've just been so freaking
busy this month literally I'm exhausted
but yeah that is it for today's
favourites video I hope you guys enjoyed
it and I will see you guys later bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
