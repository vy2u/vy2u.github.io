hey guys in today's video I'm going to
be showing you guys the things that I've
been liking over the month of
September's how it's already october i
do not understand but before i get into
those things I don't want to mention
that I did not buy any beauty products
or anything this past month so I don't
really have that many favorites but I
just really want to film a video for you
guys today and so I just kind of threw a
couple things that I've been enjoying
and decided to film this video so we'll
see where this video goes I do have to
make up products that I have been
enjoying lately the first one is an
oldie but definitely a goodie it is the
mac mineralize skinfinish natural and i
use the shade medium plus i love the new
packaging that it has i bought this i
think in the beginning of the month and
i've been using it every single day I'm
like hip havin it and I think I'm
actually gonna buy another one because I
just really like the finish of this
stuff it leaves my face Matt all day and
it also gives like a little bit more
coverage I'm glad to be back because
this stuff really is wonderful so love
it my next favorite would have to be the
tart lights camera lashes mascara and
this is my first time trying out one of
tarts mascaras I actually really like
the packaging it's like leathery and
snake skin looking a plus for the
packaging and as far as the actual
product goes this mascara is definitely
more of like a wet consistency but I
just find that this mascara makes my
eyelashes very black so what I like to
do is apply on at my benefit they're
real mascara out of my eyelashes first
and then I just quickly apply on a coat
of this on top and for being my first
heart mascara I'm definitely not
disappointed so I wanted to talk about
this one that's pretty much it for the
mega products that I've been loving
I'm not kidding you guys like I didn't
try any me products but I wanted to talk
about a body wash I don't know if I
mentioned this in my last favorites
video maybe I did maybe I didn't but
this is a bath and body works of velvet
sugar shower gel and this stuff smells
so incredibly good it's just super like
sweet and feminine and sugary yeah yeah
of course it would happen i also just
think the packaging and overall look of
it is just so adorable so I've been
really liking this my next favorite
would have to be Bath &amp;amp; Body Works room
sprays and I briefly talked about this
in my last video which was a Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works haul I will link that down below
if you guys have seen it i it
with two other youtubers and it was
really fun to film so if you haven't
seen it I think we'll be down there but
I talked about how I have been obsessed
with room sprays lately I've collected
quite a few five the first one is
marshmallow fireside which i think is my
favorite at the moment i've also got
mahogany teak wood of course lemon mint
to leave which is really fresh smelling
so if you want to trick people into
thinking that you just like cleaned your
entire apartment with those Clorox wipe
all you got to do spray this stuff I've
also got believes for the fall time and
fresh linen which is just a very clean
and fresh smelling scent hence fresh
linen it's kind of like a faster burning
candle like if someone's coming over in
five minutes you're like oh shoot my
brother smells really bad because last
week's Chinese food is sitting on the
nightstand then you can just quickly
spray this and your entire room what
will smell like beautiful insert
whatever said to you end up getting but
yeah I've been really lucky knees my
next favorite is an electronic and it is
this little baby speaker this is the x
mini sound beyond sighs speaker I don't
know but it
middle it kind of squishes into a little
balls so that you could fit it in your
purse and yeah so you just open up when
you use it plug it into your phone and
it is actually a really good speaker for
its size it's pretty good quality and it
also projects music pretty loudly so I
am very pleased with it I use this all
the time even when I'm just like
cleaning my room and stuff and I want to
blast music it's just perfect for
on-the-go to continue on with the
electronic theme my next favorite is
something that you guys probably don't
know about in my room it's a decorative
thing I've get into Claudia what are you
talking about get into it they are
lights behind my headboard let me go
turn them on right now because they're
not on tada so I got these lights from
Ikea and it's basically just like a
strip of lights and it's sticky on the
back so all I did was just press it onto
the back of my head board and i know it
doesn't really match with my room
because my whole room theme is like
white silver and gold but i usually
don't turn these on during the day so
you can't really see them but at
nighttime when i'm feeling funky and
spunky and i just want to change things
up then I turn those on and right now I
have it at the setting where it like
changes colors and yeah I've just really
been enjoying it it's really fun to just
listen to music and have the lights like
Flickr and stuff because you can also
change it so that it like strobes kind
of I think I'm actually going to keep
them on from the rest of my video
because it looks really cool hopefully
it's not distracting though it probably
will be so I apologize but I too lazy to
go back and turn it off next up I've let
me put this down it's making a ruckus oh
my gosh it's stuck on the hanger hold on
there
go and I actually featured this in my
like one of my past videos and it's from
LF it's just like a classic blue denim
jacket but it is extremely like
distressed so if you can see on the
shoulders and the back it was just like
a bunch of grips and on the sides and
stuff and yeah I really like this this
jacket is perfect for the weather right
now because here in California it gets
really cold at night time and this is
like the perfect jacket to just throw on
with any outfit and it normally matches
all my outfits so I'm really pleased
with it I got it on sale from LF like a
few weeks ago I think and I'm just
really I'm just really happy with it
it's nice love it my next favorite would
have to be in app and it is snapchat
I've actually been using snapchat for a
pretty long time now but just recently I
decided to make my public which I don't
know why I didn't do before because it's
so much more fun having you guys tweet
me screenshots of my snapchats and stuff
like that so if you guys want to follow
me on my snapchat the user name is
Claudia salut ski just like my Twitter
and Instagram and yeah if you want to
see my random photos and videos that I
take during the day then you can any in
there so I've reached the point in this
video where I have nothing else planned
to show or talk about wasn't kidding
what I said that I didn't have a lot of
favorites but I just I really wanted on
this video so I'm gonna see if I can
like think of any and the top of my head
Oh for food I've been really loving the
pumpkin soup from trader joes I think
it's a seasonal thing because i have not
like seen it in stores at least like
this year yet but i recently saw them on
display so i decided to try it out and
it is so good I've just really been
liking soup actually lately i also
really like the miso soup from whole
foods it comes in just like a little
plastic container and like the
refrigerated section near the sushi and
stuff and it is really i'm starting to
ramble I've definitely got some new
music favorites that I've been enjoying
this month so let me just go onto my
Spotify the first song that I have been
absolutely loving this month would have
to be Kanye by the chainsmokers it is
such a good song it puts me in the best
mood ever it's so like upbeat and happy
and all you want to do is just dance
around and be with your friends and
enjoy life
yeah so I've been really liking that
song and i highly recommend listening to
it i also have a playlist on here called
the lava cakes i don't know why it's
called off cakes but I've been really
liking all the songs on this playlist so
the first one that kind of stands out to
me is two weeks by fka twigs it's a
little bit more chill but it's really
fun to listen to when you're just like
in your room looking at your colorful
lights doing homework I don't know
I also fell back in love with she knows
by j.cole sitting here on the swaying to
music has definitely got to be my
favorite part in filming these favorites
videos we all know it's our favorite
part don't even lie my awkward lip
singing and dancing makes everyone super
comfortable child's play by us za is
also really good it's also very chill
and mellow yeah love that one waiting
game by banks oh I've been loving banks
lately so that song is really fun to
like blast in the car when you're
driving at night time I think it's about
it for my music favorites if I show any
others you guys would probably fall
asleep because I just really got into
that ah but that is it for today's
favorites video I hope you guys enjoyed
it I know I didn't really have a lot but
i just wanted to film for you guys and
talk to you guys comment down below what
music you've been liking lately because
i love listening to the songs that you
guys request me and you guys have some
killer music taste so leave those in the
comments below i will talk to you guys
