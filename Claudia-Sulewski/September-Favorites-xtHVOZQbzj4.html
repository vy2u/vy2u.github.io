my sep tember favorites video and I'll
making favorites videos I'm going to try
to make them every month because i don't
know i think they're fun and cool so I'm
going to do it today I have a couple
beauty products I'll show you guys a
couple of non beauty products and that's
basically I want to say and also I'm out
my hair is really cute just like in all
my videos this is my natural hair I like
when it's not Trayton straightened so I
just kind of came by the shower like
half an hour ago so my hair is kind of
damp but not really so I'm sorry but
yeah so we're just going to get right
into it because I hate when people make
really long intros and sometimes I do
that so I'm gonna get started okay so
the first two beauty-related kind of
products that i want to show you guys
are both from elf and they are the daily
brush cleaner and the brush shampoo so
you look like this and basically this is
just like a spray it comes out like a
Miss you spray on your brush you wipe it
on a towel and it basically spot clean
your brushes and kind of kills the germs
and bacteria and cleans off the makeup
and this is really great I like it a lot
it's definitely like a lot of product in
here this has 8 fluid ounces in it
compared to what i used to use which
this was like five bucks from sephora
and this only gets two fluid ounces in
it and i think this was like less than
five bucks and it's like crazy how much
does in here and how much there's not in
here so I like this a lot it works
really good i guess i don't know and the
other thing is the brush shampoo i've
only used this like once from my brushes
because i'm a really really lazy person
when it comes to cleaning my brushes but
i like it a lot because it's like suds
up or letters up really well nicely and
my brushes look like they were new after
i used it so I like this a lot check
them out on eyes lips face calm or your
nearest
whatever so next I just have a NYX jumbo
eye shadow pencil this was like featured
in my hall i think it was back to school
makeup all or something and this is an
iced mocha it looks like this and what
I'd like doing with this product is I
like smudging it on my upper lash line
and then bringing it down on my lower
lash line and that's actually what I'm
wearing right now let me just squash it
for you guys on my hand to show you guys
what a pretty color that is that's like
exactly how it looks in person it's like
I very like I'll you see you like cold
kind of brown color I don't know it's
just it's so great ok so next I have a
couple of lipsticks because you guys
know that I'm obsessed with new
lipsticks nude lips is like basically
the only thing that I we're just because
I feel like other lip colors look really
bad on me like dark colors I don't know
why but yeah ok so the first one is from
ISO space and I feel like I showed this
in my last few words I'm kind of too
lazy to go check if I did so i'm just
going to mention this one and this is a
natural nymph i'm pretty sure i showed
it to you guys but if not I don't know
but this is probably one of my favorite
new lipsticks ever in the entire world
is only five bucks and it is so pretty
oh my gosh it's like a matte nude
lipstick I'll just watch it for you guys
so there it is right next to the iced
mocha ok so it looks like that packaging
is awesome love it the next one I'm
going to show you guys is by Revlon
Colorstay and all right the calc looks
really dirty but this is the first
lipstick that i ever got from the color
state line from revlon and i really like
it it stays on a long time this one is
in smooth nude it looks like this i
guess there's a lot of products in here
and I like this a lot it's kind of like
a medium colored nude so you can see
it's a little bit darker than the elf
one the album is really like this is
kind of more on the dark side when it
comes to new colors kind of like it's
kind of like in the middle I guess I
don't know but it's not like that lights
a little bit dark but I like it a lot
and it stays on pretty nice
love the packaging it's really cool and
yet so there's that one so that I also
have another one from Revlon and this is
in soft nude this is the color burst
ones which I love this packaging oh my
gosh there you can see like a preview of
the color this lipstick is so pretty
it's like that perfect nude shade oh my
god ok I'm going to swatch it so it
looks like that it's right there love
this color oh my gosh definitely try
this if you want any like nude lipstick
that's really cheap or whatever this
stuff is the way to go so the last one
is one from the essence beauty or
whatever since I don't know but the
packaging looks like this I guess it's
ok i don't know but this is just in nude
i think no creamy nude it's some creamy
nude and it is really really creamy
which is what i really like about it
it's actually really really dark for a
new color it's kind of like a light
brown but i actually liked it a lot it's
great for like the fall time so you can
see it obviously the darkest out of all
of four but i actually liked it a lot
just because it was only like a dollar
or two dollars something and the like
texture of it is like definitely one of
my favorite lipsticks ever I wish it was
a little bit lighter but you know this
is great for full time it's kind of a
good dark nude so I like that so then I
have to nail polishes that I want to
show you guys so the first one is wagon
trail from china glaze I originally
bought this because my mom wanted it and
it's like a dark brown but then it has
gold and green kind of shimmers in it I
don't you probably can't even see it no
you can't because the lighting sucks in
here but it's actually really really
really pretty so I think it's great for
like a fall color too and then the other
nail polish is this one which is by
sally hansen complete salon salon
manicure these are probably after
chinese it's probably one of my favorite
types of nail polish just because
brushes are really thick and nice this
one is in café au laits I don't know
there you go you can see it's in 220 and
it's just your perfect nude nail polish
I'm actually wearing out my nails right
now and it's also the nail posh that I
used as a base in my fall inspired
French manicure or something like that
but yeah I love this color it's so cute
for you know the fall and stuff I feel
like this now posh kind of works with
every single season because it's you
know like a new nail polish just like
nude pumps it kind of matches to
everything these nails match to
everything so I like that so then the
next thing is a hair product I seriously
see so many girls talking about this and
I just had to get for myself and I'm so
happy I did this is the macadamia
natural oil deep repair masque looks
like this I don't know why every once we
have a coconut but it does I don't know
why but I love this stuff oh my god ever
since I like started bleaching my hair
I've only dyed my hair blonde twice so
it's kind of getting darker again I
don't know I feel like it got really
dark but what's a college my hair wasn't
such such bad conditioning condition
like it wasn't smooth at all it would
just get really really naughty and stuff
like that and it was horrible brushing
it and I want to use this I think I use
this actually well like six times I
don't know it looks like that hello like
six or seven times I don't know but
after the first time I saw a huge
difference you just put it in after air
conditioner you leave it in for seven
minutes and yeah I use this about two to
three times a week and it is seriously
just amazing you have to try oh my gosh
it was like 30 bucks so I don't know but
yeah love that I always say like that or
love that after every product I feel
like it's just a nice conclusion to like
the next product I don't know why I
always say that okay so next is kind of
more like hair-related as well and my
next favorite is my hair extensions they
look like this and I actually wore them
in
a all about my eyebrows video or
something like that my eyebrow like
routine and a lot of you guys noticed
that I was right here attention in that
video some of you guys didn't notice so
you guys were like well your hair got
really long no they were hair extensions
these are from luxyhair calm I think
it's called and these are the dirty
blonde ones they look like this I think
I've got the thinnest one I got the 120
gram or whatever i don't know i got the
thinnest one but it matches my hair
really really nicely like you I mean you
can see the difference right now but
when you like blend it together you see
so you cannot tell that it's like not my
real hair and it goes down to like here
I don't know it's so pretty though this
is real human hair i think i'm going to
do a review about these not think i
actually am definitely going to be doing
a review on these so don't worry about
that but it's so smooth and i love it
okay so now i'm going to do more like
miscellaneous type of things i don't
know so the first thing is my sony
cybershot camera i got it this month and
looks like this touch strain like that
and the reason that i bought this camera
it was because i really wanted a camera
that i can just take around me you know
like that's really small and I could
take pictures for like Facebook and
stuff like that but then I can also like
record videos with this so that's not
like that see when I'm going to be like
vlogging see how it's kind of like more
far away and stuff like that so I like
that a lot this camera is really really
nice it's dust proof it's waterproof
it's shockproof it's freezeproof so you
can like phrase this a nice and it won't
do anything and it's touch screen it
makes really really nice pictures and i
love it i got the blue one and it's just
such a pretty like turquoise et lelouch
blue color and yeah this is the TX 10
cybershot TX time you guys wandering so
I really like this and I'm really
excited to start like making more blogs
and stuff like that because I would I
hate like taking my huge camera around
to blog and stuff like that so I'm
really hot happy that I got like a
little teeny blonde to do that okay so
my next favorite is kind of a weird one
but I've just been loving this I'm
obsessed with it so this last month I
got a new backpack because my old one
wasn't even mine it was like my brothers
like friends old backpack and I think I
like stole it from him or something or
maybe like left in our house for a long
time I don't know but it was really
those really crappy and stuff like that
so I bought myself a new backpack and
it's a northface one it looks like this
I love it so much this is the poor
Willis one I think it's called I don't
know but it's really nice I love the
pockets and stuff like that khabar below
if you guys want me to do a webtoon my
backpack type of video I think that
would be really fun I love it has so
many pockets and its really nice and I
just love like big black backpacks I
don't know well it's actually not that
big which is what I like cuz then I
don't look like a freshie you know so
yeah I think I only have one more thing
that's so sad okay well the last thing
is skittles I think I'm going to make it
like a tradition to like show you guys
my favorite treat or its food or snack
of the month because i know that i did
that last time with the like little
chocolate bars so today i'm going to
show you guys skittles skittles haven't
really been my favorite only
specifically to this month skittles have
kind of been my favorite my entire life
these are definitely my favorite type of
candies ever I don't know why I just I
always been obsessed with skittles ever
since I was like two years old and these
are just original one so original ones
are the best not the sour the very ones
like those are just those are not cool
the original ones are the best looks
like that sets all those girls that said
that it's like really rooting for the
camera
share the rainbow taste the rainbow so
yeah these skittles conclude my
September favorites video so if you want
me to review anything else anyway nail
polishes or lipsticks or whatever then
it's comment below and I will do so guys
can just have an amazing day so I will
talk to you guys later and that's it
