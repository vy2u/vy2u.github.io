my September favorites video and I'll
making favorites videos I'm gonna try to
make them every month because I don't
know I think they're fun and cool so I'm
gonna do it today I have a couple beauty
products so I'll show you guys a couple
of non beauty products and that's
basically all I want to say and also I
know my hair is really cute just like in
all my videos this is my natural hair I
like when it's not treyton straightened
so I just kind of came by the shot where
like half an hour ago so my hair is kind
of damp but not really so I'm sorry but
yeah so we're just gonna get right into
it because I hate when people make
really long intros and sometimes I do
that
so I'm gonna get started okay so the
first two beauty related kind of
products that I want to show you guys
are both from ELF and they are the daily
brush cleaner and the brushed shampoo so
you look like this and basically this is
just like a spray it comes out like a
Miss you spray on your brush you wipe it
on a towel and it basically spot cleaner
brushes and kind of kills the germs and
bacteria and cleans off the makeup and
this is really great I like it a lot
it's definitely like a lot of products
in here this has eight fluid ounces in
it compared to what I used to use which
this was like five bucks from Sephora
and this only gets two fluid ounces in
it and I think this was like less than
five bucks and it's like crazy how much
goes in here and how much there's not in
here so I like this a lot it works
really good I guess I don't know and the
other thing is the brushed shampoo I've
only used this like once from my brushes
because I'm a really really lazy person
when it comes to cleaning my brushes but
I like it a lot because it's like suds
up or letters up really well nicely and
my brushes look like they were new after
I used it so I like this a lot
check them out on eyes lips acecomm or
your nearest
or whatever so next I just have a NYX
jumbo eye shadow pencil this was like
featured in my haul I think it was
packed to school makeup haul or
something and this is an iced mocha it
looks like this and what I'd like doing
with this product is I like smudging it
on my upper lash line and then bringing
it down on my lower lash line and that's
actually what I'm wearing right now let
me just squash it for you guys on my
hand to show you guys what a pretty
color that is that's like exactly how it
looks in person it's like oh very like
oh you see you like cold kind of brown
color I don't know it's just it's so
pretty okay so next I have a couple of
lipsticks because you guys know that I'm
obsessed with new lipsticks new lips is
like basically the only thing that I
wear just because I feel like other lip
colors look really bad on me like dark
colors I don't know why but yeah okay so
the first one is from eyes of space and
I feel like I showed this in my last few
words but I'm kind of too lazy to go
check if I did so I'm just going to
mention this one and this is a natural
nymph I'm pretty sure I showed it to you
guys but if not I don't know but this is
probably one of my favorite new
lipsticks ever in the entire world it's
like five bucks and it is so pretty oh
my gosh it's like a matte nude lipstick
I'll just watch it for you guys so there
it is right next to the ice smoker
okay so it looks like that packaging is
awesome love it
the next one I'm going to show you guys
is by Revlon Colorstay and alright the
calc looks really dirty but this is the
first lipstick that I ever got from the
color state line from Revlon and I
really like it it stays on a long time
this one is in smooth nude it looks like
this I guess there's a lot of products
in here and I like this a lot it's kind
of like a medium colored nude so you can
see it's a little bit darker than the
elf one the Alpha one is really like
this is kind of more on the dark side
when it comes to nude colors it's kind
of like it's kind of like in the middle
I guess I don't know but it's not like
that lights a little bit dark but I like
it a lot and it stays on pretty nicely
I love the packaging it's really cool
and yeah so there's that one so then I
also have another one from Revlon and
this is in soft nude this is the color
burst ones which I love this packaging
oh my gosh
there you can see like a preview of the
color this lipstick is so pretty it's
like that perfect nude shade oh my god
okay I'm gonna swatch it so it looks
like that it's right there love this
color
oh my gosh definitely try this if you
want any like nude lipstick that's
really cheap or whatever this stuff is
the way to go so the last one is one
from the essence beauty or whatever
since I don't know but the packaging
looks like this I guess it's okay I
don't know but this is just in nude I
think no creamy nude it's some creamy
nude and it is really really creamy
which is what I really like about it
it's actually really really dark for a
new color it's kinda like a light brown
but I actually like it a lot it's great
for like the fall time so you can see it
obviously the darkest out of all of four
but I actually like it a lot just
because it was only like a dollar or two
dollars something and the like texture
of it is like definitely one of my
favorite lipsticks ever I wish it was a
little bit lighter but you know this is
great for fall time it's kind of a good
dark nude so I like that so then I have
two nail polishes that I want to show
you guys so the first one is a wagon
trail from China Glaze
I originally bought this because my mom
wanted it and it's like a dark brown but
then it has gold and green kind of
shimmers in it I don't you probably
can't even see it no you can't because
the lighting sucks in here but it's
actually really really really pretty so
I think it's great for like a fall color
- and then the other nail polish is this
one which is by Sally Hansen
completes a lamp salon manicure these
are probably after chime days it's
probably one of my favorite types of
nail polish just because the brushes are
really thick and nice this one is in
cafe au late I don't know
there you go you
can see it's in 220 and it's just your
perfect nude nail polish I'm actually
wearing out my nails right now and it's
also the nail polish that I used as a
base in my fall inspired French manicure
or something like that
but yeah I love this color it's so cute
for you know the fall and stuff I feel
like this nail polish kind of works with
every single season because it's you
know like a new nail polish just like
nude pumps it kind of matches to
everything these nails match to
everything so I like that so then the
next thing is a hair product
I seriously see so many girls talking
about this and I just had to get for
myself and I'm so happy I did this is
the macadamia natural oil deep repair
mask looks like this I don't know why
everybody have a coconut but it does I
don't know why but I love this stuff oh
my god
ever since I like started bleaching my
hair I've only dyed my hair blonde twice
so it's kind of getting darker again I
don't know I feel like it got really
dark but what's it College my hair
wasn't such such bad conditioning
condition like it wasn't smooth at all
it would just get really really naughty
and stuff like that
and it was horrible brushing it and I
want to use this I think I use this
actually what like six times I don't
know it looks like that
probably like six or seven times I don't
know but after the first time I saw a
huge difference you just put it in after
your conditioner you leave it in for
seven minutes and yeah I use this about
two to three times a week and it is
seriously
just amazing you have to try it oh my
gosh it was like 30 bucks so I don't
know but yeah love that I always say
like that or love that after every
product I feel like it's just a nice
conclusion to like the next product I
don't know why I always say that okay so
next is kind of more like hair related
as well and my next favorite is my hair
extensions they look like this and I
actually wore them in my all by my
eyebrows video or something
that my eyebrow like routine and a lot
of you guys noticed that I was wearing
your attention in that video some of you
guys didn't notice so you guys were like
well your hair got really long no they
were hair extensions these are from luxy
hair calm I think it's called and these
are the dirty blonde ones they look like
this
I think I've got the thinnest one I got
the 120 gram or whatever I don't know I
got the thinnest one but it matches my
hair really really nicely like you I
mean you can see the difference right
now but when you like blend it together
you seriously you cannot tell that it's
like not my real hair and it goes down
to like here I don't know it's so pretty
though this is real human hair I think
I'm gonna do a review about these not
think I actually am definitely going to
be doing a review on these so don't
worry about that but it's so smooth and
I love it okay so now I'm gonna do more
like miscellaneous type of things I
don't know
so the first thing is my sony cybershot
camera i got it this month and looks
like this touch strain like that and the
reason that i bought this camera it was
because i really wanted a camera that i
can just take around me you know like
that's really small and I could take
pictures for like Facebook and stuff
like that
but then I can also like record videos
with this so that's not like that see
when I'm gonna be like vlogging see how
it's kind of like more far away and
stuff like that so I like that a lot
this camera is really really nice it's
dust proof it's waterproof its
shockproof it's freeze proof so you can
like freeze this a nice and it won't do
anything and it's touchscreen it makes
really really nice pictures and I love
it I got the blue one and it's just such
a pretty like turquoise ET lush blue
color and yeah this is the T x10
cyber-shot TX time you guys wondering so
I really like this and I'm really
excited to start like making more vlogs
and stuff like that because I would I
hate like taking my huge camera around
to vlog and stuff like that so I'm
really happy that I
like a little teeny one to do that okay
so my next favorite is kind of a weird
one but I've just been loving this I'm
obsessed with it so this last month I
got a new backpack because my old one
wasn't even mine it was like my brothers
like friends old backpack and I think I
like stole it from him or something or
maybe you like left it in our house for
a long time I don't know but it was
really those really crappy and stuff
like that stuff I bought myself a new
backpack and it's a North Face one it
looks like this I love it so much this
is the horriblest one I think it's
called I don't know but it's really nice
I love the pockets and stuff like that
comment below if you guys want me to do
it what's in my backpack type of video I
think that would be really fun I love it
it has so many pockets and it's really
nice
and I just love like big black backpacks
I don't know well it's actually not that
big which is what I like because then I
don't look like a fresh meat you know so
yeah I think I really have one more
thing that's so sad okay well last thing
is skittles I think I'm gonna make it
like a tradition to like show you guys
my favorite treat or its food or snack
of the month because I know that I did
that last time with the like little
chocolate bars so today I'm going to be
showing - skittles skittles haven't
really been my favorite only
specifically to this month
skittles have kind of been my favorite
my entire life
these are definitely my favorite type of
candies ever I don't know why I just
I've always been obsessed with skittles
ever since I was like two years old and
these are just original ones original
ones are the bus not the sour the berry
ones like those are just those are not
cool the original ones are the best
looks like that sets all those girls
that said that it's like really routine
for the camera
share the Remo
taste the rainbow so yeah these skittles
conclude my September favorites video so
if you want me to review anything else
anyway nail polishes or lipsticks or
whatever then this comment below and I
will do so guys can just have an amazing
day so I will talk to you guys later and
