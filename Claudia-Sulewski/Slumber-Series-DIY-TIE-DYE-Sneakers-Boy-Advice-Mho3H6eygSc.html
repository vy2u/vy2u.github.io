channel I haven't made a video in like
two weeks or something crazy like that
so I'm so excited to be sitting here in
my bedroom just trying with you guys so
I actually have two different video
ideas that I wanted to create for my
next video but I decided that I wanted
to make my silver series video first
because it's a little more casual and
sit down and I can really talk to you
guys and tell you guys what I've been up
to where I've been things like that so
the reason why I was gone for so long
for starters my best friend from back
home adrianna some of you guys may
recognize that name actually stay with
me for 10 whole days for her spring
break so I did not work one bit when she
was here and I kind of regret it a
little bit because 10 days is a long
time especially in YouTube world but at
the same time I really do we enjoy just
being able to relax and enjoy my time
with my best friend could have like a
piece of home back with me and get to
meet all my la friends and stuff like
that so that happened and then the day
after Adriana left I went to New York to
go shoot something which I cannot share
with you but it's really exciting and
then once I landed I had to go straight
to the MTV Movie Awards which happened
this weekend I have the awesome
opportunity to host an interview on the
red carpet for Teen Vogue which is so
exciting so I'm actually going to link
that video down below as well as right
here why not it was really fun I asked a
bunch of prom related question since
it's prom season also just in general if
you guys are not subscribed to team
votes channel I definitely recommend
subscribing to it because i have no
content onto their channel once a week
every single week so that's also why i
haven't
able to upload a lot of my channel just
a lot of stuff is going on right now and
it's really hard to be able to balance
everything out from you know work to
friends to Teen Vogue to you know I I'm
figuring it out I'm human but anyways
you can expect to see my face every
single Tuesday on their channel so I
will have a link down below if you guys
want to check them out I guess that's
kind of it for my weird long intro for
today's first segment we are going to be
doing a DIY and i will admit i did not
come up with this idea i've definitely
seen a few youtubers do it before the
first person action saw do it was
graveyard girl and it looks so fun and
so cool so honestly I just really wanted
an excuse to buy the supplies and just
do it myself so today I'm going to be
tie-dyeing white sneakers using sharpies
for this DIY you're going to need
obviously a pair of plain white sneakers
you can buy really inexpensive ones from
target which is what I did also you're
going to need sharpies in whatever
colors you'd like and I do want to
present alcohol rubbing alcohol whatever
it's called and lastly some sort of
dropper so that you're not spilling it
all over the shoes I personally think
this would be such a fun craft idea to
do on any sleep over hence why I decided
to put into this video but I think it's
really fun because you can really create
your own design I'm gonna try to go for
the typical a tie-dye look let's see how
it all goes down they might completely
family knows we'll see you want to start
off by drawing out your design and since
I'm doing tie-dye I kind of created like
a firework star shape and just continue
to expand it with the colors of the
rainbow
also I decided to only cover the front
of the shoe and the back soul you can
totally cover the entire shoe which I
think would look really cool but I kind
of want to stay away from getting the
laces dirty after that I just poured
some alcohol into a smaller cup and
started to drop it onto my design and
this is the first time I've ever done
this so I just kind of started from the
middle and worked my way outwards I
don't know if that is the greatest way
but that is what I did and it came out
pretty cool looking I did fix it up a
little bit but also here is my second
shoe the ink started to bleed onto the
outer lining so I just decided to cover
that up with some black sharpie and as
you can see i just did the same thing on
the back of the shoe and that is all I
did to create these juice and here we
have the final result so i think these
turned up pretty cool-looking the tide i
probably could look a little bit better
but this is the first time i've ever
done this before when I was actually
shopping for white sneakers a target I
could not find my size which I am only a
size 7 I can only find a size 8 so I
decided why not just give this pair to
one of you guys if any of you guys are a
size 8 in women's shoes and would like
to own this exact pair right here in my
hands um I'm actually going to carry
this over to Twitter because it's so
much easier to choosing a winner so if
you want these then just tweet me with
the hashtag I want claudius shoes and
two weeks from now i will choose a
random winner to receive them and i'll
send them right away if any of you guys
are going to enter then obviously you
have to follow me on twitter which is at
claudia Stolarski i'll have it down
there and just take me once including
hashtag you don't have to tweet multiple
times because I'll be seeing all of them
then it makes it fair for everyone so
just treat me once with hashtag and I
will be choosing a winner in two weeks
sighs a move now it is time for the Q&amp;amp;A
portion of today's episode and I decided
to spice it up a little bit and ask for
boy advice related questions this time
also keep in mind I am NOT a
professional with boys at all I'm just
going to be giving you the advice that
has either work for me or I have learned
from experience the first question comes
from Lindsay and she asks how to get
over a guy I feel like I personally
never really experienced like a really
really tough breakup but most part all
the breakups that I have been through
were either super short super quick kind
of like ripping off a band-aid and then
that was kind of the end of it if you're
breaking up with a guy that you've been
going out for a long time with I would
definitely recommend to take that time
to kind of focus on yourself and work on
yourself whether it's mentally or
physically so for example do different
things that would help kind of boost
your confidence back up as well as kind
of distract you at the same time I know
a huge one is working out and just
eating healthy because obviously that
makes you feel so awesome and that's a
really great way to kind of let out your
emotions through running really fast and
kind of you know getting yourself back
on track also I would definitely
recommend trying to stay away from him
so for example if you guys have mutual
friends then maybe try to kind of avoid
any social situations with him for at
least like the first month just so that
you can get used to kind of being on
your own and not always having him on
your side and obviously seeing you know
your ex-boyfriend an ex-girlfriend
immediately
breaking up with them is really hard
because either a you still have feelings
for them or being you're upset about the
situation obviously it depends on why
you guys broke up but I would definitely
recommend to kind of keep your distance
and you know kind of cool off a little
bit and lastly I would recommend to hang
out with your friends lot and don't
really isolate yourself in your bedroom
I would definitely recommend going out
getting nails done getting pedicure
going shopping whatever you like doing
with your friends playing sports I don't
know talking to them about the situation
and everything can really help you kind
of better understand it feel better
about it so that's probably what I would
say the next question comes from Gabry
and she tweeted I've been dating a guy
for a while and he barely comes to my
games which is very important to me how
do I tell him that it sets me honestly I
think communication is key to a
relationship or a successful
relationship at that if you guys are
different pages or if something's
bothering you and you're not willing to
tell him that how is he supposed to
assume that it's bothering you without
that communication so I definitely think
this is a huge issue in relationships
and a lot of times both people are super
compatible but it's the communication
that's missing this particular situation
I would definitely say just to sorry my
phone is going off just to be straight
up honest with him and don't really put
it in a negative way and be like oh I
hate when you don't go to my Kings it
makes me really mad but kind of switch
it more on to a Leonard up and make it
more positive thing and be like hey babe
I would love if you came to one of my
games one day it'd be awesome to see you
support me because this sport is very
important to me and honestly I think
just saying that
him should make him understand and want
to go if he cares about you because you
know it's important the next question
comes from Avery and she tweets how to
tell if a guy likes you so obviously
this totally depends on the guy because
everyone is different but there are
definitely a few like universal things
that a lot of guys tend to do if they
like a girl the first one it would
definitely be I contact for anyone that
is interested in you this is also like
between friends though so this is why
I'm kind of putting this one first no
but I think I contact is very important
if a guy is like giving you direct eye
contact all the time not only get a
creepy way obviously but that will show
that he's at least interested in
listening to what you have to say and
engaging into a conversation so that's
kind of like the first thing that you
should look for secondly I would
definitely say touching and I don't mean
that in a perverted way guys having a
conversation with a girl that he likes
he will normally either purposely or
just subconsciously find different
excuses to kind of like touch her
whether it's shrug her shoulder or
jokingly like I'm sure what else you
guys do play with your hair um just
doing like playful things like that in
general if a guy is asking you a lot of
questions or one of your opinions on
things and that shows that he respects
what's going on up here and he wants to
know more I would say those are the most
obvious kind of universal ones that God
is like to do the next question is I
never know what to buy guys for holidays
and birthdays any ideas I feel like this
is the topic or question or whatever
that girls tend to stress a lot about
but if you're going out someone that
most likely means are spending a lot of
time with them which most likely means
that you are talking to them a lot I
don't know I guess I kind of
depends on the person I definitely love
kind of taking mental notes and if a guy
would like to mention something that
they like or that like they secretly
want i'll immediately will point that in
my head and then later when i get home
i'll either write it on my phone or
somewhere on a piece of paper so i would
definitely recommend to start kind of
making your list before holidays or
their birthday start coming up yeah that
would be my number one tip I feel like a
lot of people wait to the last minute
and then they're like oh my god I don't
know what to get her / him so I would
definitely say to kind of prepare in
advance and as you go just constantly be
thinking about things that you can treat
your girlfriend or boyfriend and then
eventually when the day comes you'll
have a whole list of things that you can
pick out it the next question comes from
Pew Clemens and they tweet I like him
but he's famous and doesn't know I exist
that could be an issue that's that's an
issue how can I make a guy jealous and
trust me he deserves it and I love you
so so so much well first off I love you
as well and I feel like you can handle
this situation in two different
directions one of them is not a good
idea at all and one of them could
actually potentially work so we'll start
off with a bad one i 100% do not
recommend making a guy jealous by using
other guys so whether it's hooking up
with another guy or posting a photo with
a guy spreading rumors about you and a
different guy whatever it may be I feel
like that just kind of adds more fire to
the situation if they knew that you're
really just using them to get someone
else jealous they probably wouldn't be
hooking up with you were doing whatever
you know you're doing with them so i
would not recommend adding in any more
boys show you a guy that you are happy
and confident without having him in your
life is a huge way to make a guy jealous
i feel like this really shouldn't even
be the goal but it definitely
can be kind of like in effect from it
just in general I feel like girls who
show that they can still be happy being
single or you know just doing their own
thing and stay confidence is just a
really attractive thing and guys I step
away from him do your own thing and
people find happiness and something else
and just by doing that he'll kind of
naturally feel a little jealous because
he'll be like why isn't she thinking
about me why isn't she upset like she
seems to be doing really good on your
own I feel like that's kind of a better
way to handle the situation but all in
all you shouldn't be making anyone
jealous if there's you know a deeper
issue as to why you're trying to make
him jealous probably doesn't sound like
a good idea to even be associated with
them let go do this thing was that good
advice I don't know five sauce addiction
tweets had a deal with boys very simple
don't deal with boys they are not worth
your time Polly asks what do you do when
you start to like your best guy friend
especially when he has a girlfriend that
is a really sticky situation I
personally have never been in a
situation like that before well for
starters definitely do not try to break
up your best friend and his girlfriend I
would say just wait slept things kind of
naturally happen and unfold and if your
best friend and his girlfriend are not
meant to be then they'll break up and
who knows maybe eventually he will have
the same feelings for you but definitely
don't force anything don't rush anything
I really wouldn't like mess with their
relationship the last question asks
there's this guy like but he doesn't
know me what should I do I would say try
to meet him in a social situation that
is very casual it's not just you two and
it doesn't seem like you forced it or
anything like that if you guys have any
mutual friends that is definitely an
easy way to get to know someone is just
by hanging out there
big group and then eventually you know
getting that one-on-one conversation go
to him with confidence and talk to him
and if you you know truly think that you
guys will be compatible and that you
guys have interests and things like that
then it should feel very natural and at
the end of the day you only regret the
things that you don't do so why not just
go and do it give it a shot if it
doesn't you know work out if he doesn't
seem interested then it's not the end of
the world so that would be my advice and
that actually wraps up the Q&amp;amp;A section
portion of this episode so that is it
for today's video I hope you guys
enjoyed it I'll see you guys next week
for a really fun and cool videos to
watch out for that and I love you guys
I'll talk to you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
