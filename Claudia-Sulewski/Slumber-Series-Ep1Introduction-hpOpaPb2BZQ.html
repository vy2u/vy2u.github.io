doing my first episode of my new video
series and I'm so so excited to start
doing these and this new segment on my
channel is going to be called slumber
series with the videos I'm currently
uploading I feel like I'm not able to
connect with you guys more than I know
that I could so recently I started
brainstorming a little and thinking
about how girls like to get together to
connect more on a personal level and
just kind of get to know each other and
the first thing that popped in my head
were sleepovers so hence slumber series
so basically for every single episode
I'm going to be sitting here on my bed
in my pajamas talking to you guys and I
really want these videos just to be fun
and not taken too seriously and the
whole point is to make you guys feel as
though you're actually having a
sleepover with me I'm really excited to
start making these videos because I feel
like no one has really done this on
YouTube before so it's kind of something
new and fresh and exciting for every
episode I'm going to be talking about
different things in different topics so
for example maybe for one episode I will
share pictures of you guys for me in the
past or I'll share stories or I'll give
you guys advice or beauty and fashion
tips also be throwing in my current
favorites maybe like a favorite song or
my favorite candle or book maybe a
favorite quote that I'm liking literally
the topics are going to be endless so
that's what I think is going to make
this series very fun because it's always
gonna be very different so I'm basically
just going to be talking about different
things that girls would normally talk
about during sleepovers and also at the
end of each episode I will be answering
a few of your guys's questions so every
single time I'm going to be recording
one of these episode
I'm going to tweet out to you guys
saying that on filming one and if you
guys want any of your questions to be
featured in a future episode
then just tweet me when I asked for you
guys to tweet me and I'll just be
answering questions from my Twitter
since today's video is my first episode
I kind of wanted to keep it short and
simple and sweet because I really just
wanted to introduce you guys to this new
video series and I mainly just wanted to
hear your guys's opinions on this
whether you even want to watch these
types of videos because obviously if you
guys don't want to see this then I won't
be making them but I also wanted to ask
for you guys to give me feedback on what
else you think I can create and make
with these videos maybe like different
topics that I could talk about or I mean
I don't know maybe like some truth or
dare things I could throw in so
obviously these videos are going to be
very fun and silly and loose and stuff
like that
because I really just want to be able to
interact with you guys more often um for
example I was thinking about sometimes I
can ask you guys to send me photos of
different topics or whatever and then I
could feature your photos in my next
episode so that you can be in the video
I'm suggest stuff like that I think this
is gonna be a really fun way to interact
with you guys and just connect better
with you guys because I just feel like I
you guys always listen to what I have to
say and stuff like that and I want to be
able to hear more from you guys so
comment below and tell me what you guys
think of this idea I'm personally really
excited for it I think this is gonna be
a great addition to my channel because
when you're just creating tutorials and
reviews and all that stuff it's kind of
boring and serious so this will be great
to kind of spice it up and spark it up
and stuff so I'm not really sure how
often I'm going to be filming these but
every so often I'll be doing them and
I'm really excited so I want to hear
your thoughts and opinions down below
and that is it for today's episode so I
will talk to you guys for a new video
very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
