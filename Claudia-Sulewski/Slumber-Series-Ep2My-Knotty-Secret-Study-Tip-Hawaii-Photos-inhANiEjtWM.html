of my summer series and I want to start
out by thanking you guys for your
amazing feedback on my first episode you
guys seem to really really love this
idea just like I do and you guys gave me
some really really good ideas and topics
to cover during the series so thank you
so much for all of your ideas and
comments and stuff I'm in an awesome
mood right now because my fuzzy socks
match my pajamas today and also i got a
new bedspread my mom surprised me a
couple days ago it's from anthropology
and i'm obsessed with it I just it's
complete I feel complete so today's
first topic is a fashion tips so let's
get that rolling knotting my shirts has
become one of my most essential trends
that I use year-round but sometimes when
you use shirts that are too thick the
knots end up looking a little bit too
bulky or big and they just kind of stick
out so today I want to share with you
guys a little secret that I like to do
so first I grab some a little clear
elastic hair ties and I create a
ponytail with my shirt I then fold to
the ponytail in half to make it look
like a knot and if you want you can take
another hair tied to help secure it or
flatten it down and I love this little
trick because the nuts end up looking a
lot smaller and I think it just looks
great so my next topic is a study tip
and unfortunately this is only for my
iPad users but I just really want to
share this app with you guys I've been
using it for studying and I'm obsessed
with it um so it is called a good notes
it's right there it is literally like a
virtual notebook I'm so when you open it
up there's a bunch of different shelves
then you can create different notebooks
for example I made this one for finals I
just started doing it today but it's
awesome because literally like you can
here let me show you like you can write
stuff with this you can type out things
you can use highlighters and highlight
things but I really like using this for
notes that I've already written and I
add it on to the app and then I just
kind of go through and highlight
anything that I specifically want to
know or make little notes so for example
I can zoom up on something and highlight
it like that I can Circle things and
it's just so fun to play around with and
it also motivates me to study and stuff
like that and also this app is great
because you don't need any internet
connection to use it so if you don't
have a 3g ipad it's fine because you can
use it anywhere and also if you're the
type of person that carries their ipad
around like i am that it's great because
if you're in the car or if you're just
free and you don't feel like carrying
all of your you know notes of you and
stuff then you can easily just study
anything that you need to write off your
ipad and I actually have finals this
week so this is a great way to you know
study different things you know
throughout the day or whatever so I
think it's great it's like a to go on
notebook and it's free for making two
notebooks but if you want to make more
notebooks in the app then you have to
pay five dollars but I think it's worth
it because it is an awesome tool for
studying
a lot of you guys really likes the idea
of me sharing photos of you guys so if
you saw my last video or any of my vlogs
then you would know that I just spent a
whole week and quiet it was beautiful
and amazing so I wanted to show you guys
a couple of the photos that I took their
i took some photography you know like
artsy photos so i just want to show you
a couple of those
do
so as you can see from the photos it was
literally amazing it was like unreal in
Hawaii um it was my first time going and
it was just incredible so now let's get
on to the Twitter talk segment so now it
is time at for Twitter talk woot woot so
I actually tweeted right before I
clicked the record button I'm so I'm
just going to choose some random
questions that you guys have tweeted me
okay do you have a boyfriend no i don't
I'm single I'm seriously cat lady ever
since I got a can I just what's your
favorite artists of the moment I have a
couple I really like Macklemore and
Sammy Adams and all right well that's
too but those have been like my
favorites who is your celebrity crush oh
my god Liam Hemsworth he is so hot
especially in the last song oh my god
i'm so jealous of miley cyrus how old
were you when you started making YouTube
um I forgot shoot i mean i started in
2009 november first i believe so i don't
really feel like doing the math but yeah
i think i was in like seventh grade what
is your favorite drink to get from
starbucks definitely the iced white
mocha because of a beauty maybe 44 she
introduced it to me in new york and it
is like the best tasting coffee in the
entire world do you have any tattoos
because in a lot of your recent videos
it looks like there's one on your
shoulder just wondering smile
face um actually I think that was my
sweater in my ombre video I'm pretty
sure that's what you're talking about
because I saw a couple of those comments
but no i don't i don't have any tattoos
did even legal for 16 year old to get
tattoos I don't even know but no I don't
have any although I really do want to
get one on my lip right here um that
would be awesome and plus like no one
can see it sounds like your little
secret you know the last question for
today's episode is if you had a baby
right now what would it be if it was a
boy I would definitely need it Mason
because I'm obsessed with that name for
girls I'm not really sure maybe Megan
that kind of like Megan but I really
know about girl names that is it for
Twitter talk today and if you guys will
be featured in my next episode then you
might want to follow me on twitter
because I tweet out when to ask me
questions before a jump sewed and all
you have to do is at reply me at
Claudius life asking my questions and
then also in your tweet hashtag slumber
series so that is just easier for me to
find you know those questions because I
do get other like mentions and stuff so
it'll be easier to find your questions
that is pretty much everything of
today's episode so for my next episode I
really want to do what would you rather
so I want you guys to leave comments
down below on some would you rather
questions just make sure that they're
you know appropriate for all ages and
stuff like that but they could literally
be anything like they could be me eating
stuff or going somewhere or Binks i

endless so yeah i'm looking forward to
