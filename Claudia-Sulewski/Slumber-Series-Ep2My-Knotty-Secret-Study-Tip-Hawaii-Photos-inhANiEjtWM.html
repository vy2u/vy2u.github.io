of my summer series and I want to start
out by thanking you guys for your
amazing feedback on my first episode you
guys seem to really really love this
idea just like I do and you guys gave me
some a really really good ideas some
topics to cover during the series so
thank you so much for all of your ideas
and comments and stuff I'm in an awesome
mood right now because my fuzzy socks
match my pajamas today and also I got a
new bedspread my mom surprised me a
couple days ago
it's from Anthropologie and I'm obsessed
with it I just it's complete I feel
complete so today's first topic is a
fashion tip so let's get that rolling
nodding my shirts has become one of my
most essential trends that I use
year-round but sometimes when you use
shirts that are too thick the knots end
up looking a little bit too bulky or big
and they just kind of stick out so today
I want to share with you guys a little
secret that I like to do so first I grab
some little clear elastic hair ties and
I create a ponytail with my shirt I then
fold to the ponytail in half to make it
look like a knot and if you want you can
take another hair tie to help secure it
or flatten it down and I love this
little trick because the knots end up
looking a lot smaller and I think it
just looks great
so my next topic is a study tip and
unfortunately this is only for my iPad
users but I just really wanted to share
this app with you guys I've been using
it for studying and I'm obsessed with it
so it is called a good notes
it's right there it is literally like a
virtual notebook I'm so when you open it
up there's a bunch of different shelves
and then you can create different
notebooks for example I made this one
for finals I just started doing it today
but it's awesome because literally like
you can here let me show you like you
can write stuff with this you can type
out things you can use highlighters and
highlight things but I really like using
this for notes that I've already written
and I add it on to the app and then I
just kind of go through and highlight
anything that I specifically want to
know or make little notes so for example
I can zoom up on something and highlight
it like that I can circle things and
it's just so fun to play around with and
it also motivates me to study and stuff
like that and also this app is great
because you don't need any internet
connection to use it so if you don't
have a 3G iPad it's fine because you can
use it anywhere and also if you're the
type of person that carries their iPad
around like I am that it's great because
if you're in the car or if you're just
free and you don't feel like carrying
all of your you know notes of you and
stuff then you can easily just study
anything that you need to right off your
iPad and I actually have finals this
week so this is a great way to you know
study different things you know
throughout the day or whatever so I
think it's great it's like a to go
notebook and it's free for making two
notebooks but if you want to make more
notebooks in the app then you have to
pay five dollars but I think it's worth
it because it is an awesome tool for
studying
a lot of you guys really liked the idea
of me sharing photos of you guys so if
you saw my last video or any of my vlogs
then you would know that I just spent a
whole week and kawaii it was beautiful
and amazing so I wanted to show you guys
a couple of the photos that I took there
I took some photography you know like
artsy photos so I just want to show you
a couple of those
so as you can see from the photos it was
literally amazing it was like unreal in
Hawaii it was my first time going and it
was just incredible so now let's get on
to the Twitter talk segment so now it is
time at for Twitter talk whoo so I
actually tweeted right before I clicked
the record button um so I'm just gonna
choose some random questions that you
guys have tweeted me okay do you have a
boyfriend no I don't I'm single I'm
seriously cat lady and ever since I got
a cat I just what's your favorite
artists of the moment I have a couple I
really like Macklemore and Sammy Adams
and all right well that's two but those
have been like my favorites who is your
celebrity crush oh my god Liam Hemsworth
he is so hot especially in the last song
oh my god I'm so jealous of Miley Cyrus
how old were you when you started making
YouTube I forgot shoot I mean I started
in 2009 November first I believe so I
don't really feel like doing the math
yeah I think I was in like seventh grade
what is your favorite drink to get from
Starbucks definitely the iced white
mocha because of beauty maybe 44 she
introduced it to me in New York and it
is like the best-tasting coffee in the
entire world do you have any tattoos
because in one of your recent videos it
looks like there's one on your shoulder
just wondering the smiley face um
actually I think that was my sweater in
my own video I'm pretty sure that's what
you're talking about because I saw a
couple of those comments but no I don't
I don't have any tattoos is it even
legal for 16 year old to get tattoos I
don't even know but I don't have any
although I really do want to get one on
my lips right here that would be awesome
and plus like no one can see it so it's
like your little secret you know the
last question for today's episode is if
you had a baby right now what would its
name be if it was a boy I would
definitely name it Mason because I'm
obsessed with that name for girls I'm
not really sure maybe Megan that kind of
like them again but I really know about
girl names that is big for Twitter talk
today and if you guys will be featured
in my next episode then you might want
to follow me on twitter because i tweet
out when to ask me questions before i
jump so and all you have to do is at
reply me at claudius life ask me my
questions and then also in your tweet
hashtag slumber series so that it's just
easier for me to find you know those
questions because I do get other like
mentions and stuff so be easier to find
your questions that is pretty much
everything of today's episode so for my
next episode I really want to do what
would you rather so I want you guys to
leave comments down below on some would
you rather questions just make sure that
they're you know appropriate for all
ages and stuff like that but they could
literally be anything like
