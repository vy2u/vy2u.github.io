this you know that's it's not that hard
I guess I'm gonna go with the diary of
milkshake he was on a horse a pole and
she was humping the pole you are sick hi
guys so welcome to episode number three
of my slumber series and I just wanted
to quickly mention that I'm totally over
the whole to angle thing where I would
like switch camera angles because I
tried it out at my last episode and all
of you guys hated it and you said how
awkward it was so we're just going to
pretend like that never happened in that
episode just you know never happened so
um yeah I'm done with that but I just it
took me so long to like edit it so I
felt like once I was done I just I want
to upload it and see if you guys would
like it you know I'm really glad that
you guys didn't like it because that
literally took like an hour to do i'm
also really bumming it out for today's
episode I'm wearing like my actual
pajamas that I will be sleeping in
tonight so I'm wearing my Florida shirt
and some lime green sweatpants from a
tour secret they're very obnoxious
today's first topic is actually a recipe
that I came up with recently and I want
me show you guys how to make rice
krispies s'mores now you guys will see
that this recipe is super super fast and
easy to make but I just wanted to share
it with you guys because I think it's
something kind of different and you know
creative to do if you're having a
sleepover with your girlfriends and you
know what to make so I just think it's
really fun and it tastes amazing
obviously so let's go see how you can
make this at home
for this recipe you're going to need
milk chocolate marshmallows and I used
about one and a half bags Rice Krispies
cereal the only one I could find was
gluten free but it tastes the same and
you're going to need some graham
crackers so first what you're going to
do is prepare the graham crackers so i
am just crushing them because you want
them to be in smaller pieces now i
didn't really worry about measurements
because you can really add in as much as
you want little did i know i would end
up eating a lot more than this but that
is how big my pieces were now what i'm
going to do is dump out a whole bag of
marshmallows into a large mixing bowl
and you just want to melt them in the
microwave then once it's melted you want
to start adding in your graham crackers
and your cereal and i did about like
half and half like a ratio of 1 to 1 so
I you can just see here that I'm adding
more so you can really just add however
much you want so there's really no like
specific measurements
next up you want to grab some sort of
square pan and this will help create the
shape for our rice krispie treats and
also guys you have to use some sort of
olive oil or cooking spray or something
just to spray the pan itself as well as
your hands because melted marshmallows
are super super sticky and this will
save your life like just do it okay so
as you can see here I'm putting it into
the pan and once I have all that in
there I'm just going to press it down to
make sure I get it into every single
corner I ended up making another batch
because I wanted the rice krispies
treats to be a little bit taller and
also I wanted it to completely fill the
pan so as you see here I'm just pressing
down any more into little corners just
to try to get it as perfect as possible
now before you start cutting it you want
to make sure to let it sit a little bit
so that being marshmallows start to
harden again then you want to spray your
knife which will help to cut the treats
and you just want to start cutting them
I cut them into little cubes and then
also you can see I kind of padded them
down to make them look nicer after I cut
every single one and I'm just laying
them down on some tin foil so that when
we put the chocolate on top I won't make
a mess
so here's how all of my rice krispies
s'mores turned out then you can really
make them any size now I'm just grabbing
a microwavable bowl and melting the
chocolate in the microwave it looks so
good I know so then you just want to
grab a fork and start drizzling the
chocolate across the rice krispie
s'mores and you can put in as much or as
little chocolate as you want you can
also dip them if you want more but I
thought this looked really cute so
obviously this recipe is very very easy
and very fast but it tastes really
really good so once you let the
chocolate dry then you are done now many
of you guys end up making these rice
krispie s'mores then either post a photo
on instagram with hashtags number series
or just tweet me on twitter with hashtag
slumber series and you may possibly be
featured in my next episode so make sure
to send me photos if you guys try it out
as well
now let's get on to today's next topic
which is would you rather so on my last
episode I asked you guys to comment down
below asking me some would you rather
questions today I'm going to be
answering at some of those I will also
have the username right down here so
that you guys can see who asked these
questions so the first one is would you
rather pee every time you stand up or
poo every time you sit down um that's a
lot of being and booing but i guess i
would say pee every time i stand out
because doing is gross and I sit down a
lot during the day so can I just not
answer that question that that doesn't I
can't that's not possible like I don't
know would you rather run your tongue
down 10 feet of a new york city street
or press your tongue into a stranger's
nostril i really don't know how you guys
come up with these questions um probably
the nostril one because i would probably
like it sick and die from the New York
City straight ones so nostril probably
would you rather die your hair
permanently green or kiss a monkey
definitely kissa monkey I would kiss a
monkey just so that I could say I've
kissed a monkey would you rather eat 10
spiders or have to sit in elephant poop
for 10 minutes probably the spider one I
would just like put into a sandwich or
something and eat it um i would never
sinned elephant poop for 10 minutes that
was just really gross I don't even want
to say this one okay would you rather
smell like a fart all the time for the
rest of your life or drink a diarrhea
milkshake you are sick I guess I'm gonna
go with the diary of milkshake because
smile like a fart the rest of my life
would be so gross and unattractive but I
don't know I the milkshake would you
rather wear red lipstick or nude okay a
normal one um definitely nude you guys
you guys know how I am about my do lips
feel like I say that in every single
video mine but you know I am
actually not wearing your lips today but
your lips would you rather slay a dragon
or wrestle a bear and you won't get hurt
um well I already Slade like four
dragons so I guess I wrestle bear
because I don't know I you know been
there done that would you rather have
your account get hacked for a year or
would you rather have to pay five
dollars for every video you make well
figuring that I've already been hacked
once that was not fun at all i was
hacked for I i would say a few days or
something because i got it back because
i like talk to google and i filled out
this form I don't know whatever but um I
would definitely rather pay five dollars
for every video I make for sure um I I
would die if I got hacked for a year I
don't know what I would do with myself
would you rather cut off your thumb or
your big toe um probably the big toe
because I use my thumb's for everything
like picking things up and stuff I can't
even imagine that like I don't I just
kind of make something help right now um
but what don't you like not have valence
without a big toe would you rather lose
your combat boots or a boyfriend
boyfriend so those are all of the would
you rather questions that i will be
answering today they were definitely
something really interesting a home so
let's get on to the next topic
all right I am really excited to be
sharing this one with you guys so when I
first when i made my first episode i
asked you guys what kind of topics even
want me to cover and obviously the most
requested one was boys boys boys boys
since everyone in my entire school
basically knows about my youtube videos
i didn't really want to cover the
subject of boys because like everyone
sees them and that's just kind of
embarrassing but i decided that i want
to share my first date story with you
guys because I just think it's really
funny it happened a long time ago and I
don't know I thought it would make a
good story first I'm gonna give you guys
a little bit of background information
before i get into the story so i think
ok so it's definitely during this summer
i can't remember if it was like before
6th grade or before seven but i was
going out with this one kid and he was
my first boyfriend and it was just it
was that typical middle school
relationship where you barely ever hang
out you just text every single day and
your conversations are like hey what's
up nothing how about you cool LOL like
you know what I mean um so what happened
was we were going out and I think we're
going on for like two weeks a week I
don't even I don't know and um he asked
me to go see a movie with me I'm pretty
sure it was like Harry Potter or
something and we were just the most
awkward people ever so you know we
decided to bring along a friend with us
so I brought one of my best friends that
he brought one of his friends so the
four of us yeah it wasn't even one on
one because we would just die of
awkwardness if it was just us two so it
was us for we like met up in this little
like area like close to where
by the movie theater and we're just kind
of sitting there like you know having
awkwardness small talk okay so when we
were going into the movie theater I
thought he was gonna pay for me because
pretty sure he likes and he was gone out
and then it just something happen where
I was like all right I'm being for
myself so it just bets where it all
began that's when I just really got out
to a nice start and then we get into the
movie theater and lose webstart and it
was like my boyfriend's friend my
boyfriend of me and then my friends you
know we're like in the middle and all I
remember from that date was that he
wouldn't put his arm around me I don't
know why I was so upset I was sitting
there like he doesn't like me he
definitely doesn't like Nikki doesn't
have his all around me right now like
all I had to do was just go like this
you know that's this not that hard and
for some reason he just didn't do it and
I was really set but I
Jeanette once the movie was over we left
the theater and I'm pretty sure we just
went back to the table and just started
like talking for a little bit or
something and I'm pretty sure we didn't
even hug goodbye so um claudie didn't
really scoring points that day because
that was the most like awkward day in my
life but that is my first date story I
guess I wouldn't even consider it a
first date but I guess I kind of do so
tell me if you guys had an awkward
birthday just like I did so tell me your
stories down below I would love to read
them I wanted to see if you wanted to be
my video you guys going to be in my
video yeah Oh God
oh my god wow they know my name I'm
sorry that was really random but it's a
friday night and it's like ten o'clock
right now and um I couldn't hang out
tonight because I want to film this
video for you guys so I just wanted to
say hi to my friends and I decided to
put it on camera so let's get on with
the last topic of today's video which is
Twitter talk so before I started filming
this I tweeted up to guys so let's see
what you guys have been asking me so the
first one is when was your first kiss
and I think it was the summer before 7th
grade or I think so 47 it was around
seventh grade would you like to meet
your five-year-old self I would
definitely want to meet my five-year-old
self I don't even remember what I was
like back then I was probably like super
cool and chill what is one thing you
want to do before you die I forgot what
this is called I was gonna because i saw
this question earlier and I was gonna
like research what it's called before
started filming but I forgot it's this
thing where you're like you hold on to
this bar and it's kind of like a huge
kite I think it's called um oh my gosh
it's on the tip of my tongue you like
jump off a cliff and you like hold on
you're like strapped on and you're kind
of like soaring through the air down and
then
you eventually land on the ground this
is really bothering me I don't know what
it's called but couple of you guys know
what I'm talking about I saw a video of
shaycarl doing it once and I freaked out
because it looks so much fun what is
your favorite TV show at the moment
probably the Carrie Diaries I've been
watching every single episode every
monday and i love it i think it's a
great show it's definitely different
from a lot of the shows out there and i
also used to love sex in the city who
was your first concert i'm pretty sure
it was Madonna yeah I went with my mom I
don't recall what year it was but all I
remember is she was on a horse with a
pole and she was humping the pole what
is your favorite late-night snack oh my
gosh like every snack but uh huh I think
I would have to go with popcorn I don't
know why I'm obsessive popcorn so that's
it for today's episode which is really
sad because I had so much fun filming it
for you guys i hope you guys enjoyed
this episode and if you ever want to be
featured in a future one um you can
tweet me hashtag slumber series when I
ask for questions or you know stuff like
that or you just comment down below so
