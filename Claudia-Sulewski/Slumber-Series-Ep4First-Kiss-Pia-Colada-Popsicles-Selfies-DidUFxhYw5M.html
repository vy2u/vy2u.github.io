of my summer series this is actually the
first episode with this bed because I
got a new bed like a few months ago oh
it's not even that new anymore but this
is my first time so welcome to this bed
i know i haven't done one of these in a
very long time so for those of you who
are a little bit confused on what this
is what is slumber series you can click
on the flower that's up here that will
take you to the first episode where i
talk about what i do on these little
episodes as well as why i started doing
them so you can just pause this video
and click on it and it will open up a
new window so you can just quickly watch
that also if these fingers look a little
dirty it's from hair dye i stained my
fingers by accident well not by accident
i just didn't use gloves you sure to see
them like three days ago they were like
pitch black so there it's almost
something's gone
I'm going to start out today's episode
by sharing a little recipe with you guys
I'm going to be showing you guys how to
make homemade pina colada popsicles this
is a perfect recipe for the summer time
since it's very hot outside right now
and also these are very very healthy
these popsicles are made out of only
three ingredients and all of them are
healthy and natural and all that stuff
and it also really does taste like a
piña colada I'm obsessed with it I'm so
good these are perfect to make before
you go to bed because you can freeze
them overnight and they will be ready in
the morning so keep on watching if you
want to see how I make these you're
first going to need a blender and
coconut milk and coconut milk has fifty
percent more calcium than dairy milk
it's also a great source of vitamin D
and it's also just very healthy for you
and it works perfectly with our pina
colada recipe so you're going to need
that as well as frozen pineapples and
frozen mangoes and when you're buying a
frozen fruit make sure that the fruit is
the only ingredients otherwise just by
your own fruit cut it up and freeze it
and then lastly you're going to need a
popsicle molds all I'm doing is adding
an equal proportion of the pineapples
and mango and then I'm just going to add
in my coconut milk and I don't really
follow any measurements I kind of just
guess every time and add whatever I need
to add if I don't like it so then I'm
just going to blend it up
after that I'm going to pour in my
mixture into my popsicle molds place
your popsicles into your freezer for a
few hours and they will be ready to eat
also a quick tip for you guys if you
ever have troubles popping your
popsicles out of their molds then you
can always use all natural coconut water
to lightly grease the inside and this
will help complement with the pina
colada flavor so as you can see it is
very very easy to make those popsicles
and also if you're a little bit too
anxious and you like smoothies then you
can also just drink it right away
because that's actually how I make my
smoothies I just use frozen fruit and
either coconut milk or almond milk so
you can just make it right away and
drink it with your friends also on my
last episode I showed you guys how to
make my rice krispies s'mores and a lot
of you guys tweeted me pictures of your
rice krispies s'mores which made me so
happy every time I would see them um so
I am going to show some of your guys's
recreations right now they all look so
delicious I just want to eat all of them
so if any of you guys decide to recreate
my pina colada popsicles then make sure
to tweet me or Instagram meet with the
hashtag slumber series and maybe
possibly you will be featured in my next
episode if not you guys can just sweet
me telling me what you guys thought
about the recipe and if you also think
that it tastes like a piña colada
because I personally think it tastes
exactly like one so I love it course
virgin pina coladas not the ones with
the alcohol in it
you gonna get close and personal story
time so I got a bunch of requests asking
for me to share with you guys my first
kiss story because a lot of you enjoyed
my first date story and sadly I don't
really have a very exciting story it
wasn't even romantic or anything it just
sort of happened but I'm gonna share
this start with you guys anyways so I
was going out with this kid and this was
in seventh grade oh my god if he watches
this video hey Jimmy so anyways we were
in seventh grade and I was going out
this kid we're probably going out I
honestly I couldn't even tell you
anyways so my school has got a lot of
different parks surrounding it so a lot
of the times after school my friends and
I would just go to the park and just
hang out at the park back that and it
like the park is where everything
happened it was like the hot spot like
that's like where we hung out on our
like friday nights swinging on the
swings to like 10pm so one day after
school I'm pretty sure it was like a
Friday my friends like guys and girls we
all went to the park and we just hung
out at the park and I just remember the
entire day everyone is telling me like
oh my god Claudia like he's gonna kiss
you he's planning on it so I totally
knew his coming um and he was kind of
like planning with his friends and
everything i guess i don't i don't even
know I could be wrong but somehow I knew
anyways um the day was like I remember
it was a good day I'm guessing so we're
at the park for a few hours like on the
swing sets and stuff I don't really know
and it was time to say goodbye so I was
like you know this is like my first kiss
okay so I was like I was a little
nervous I was definitely overthinking it
a little throughout the day I was kind
of like thinking about how it was going
to happen and for some reason I thought
that when you kiss your boyfriend /
girlfriend goodbye it you're supposed to
hug them first and then kiss them
apparently it's the opposite you're
supposed to kiss them and then hug them
so you know we're all like we're all
like standing together in this little
area and we're like
getting ready to say goodbye and stuff
everyone's like hugging and stuff and
then you know me and my boyfriend were
about to say goodbye so like you know we
started getting closer and okay everyone
was watching us it's not even like we
were alone it was just like everyone
we're like getting closer and like I'm
going in for the hug because I thought
you're supposed to hug first I don't
know why as he's trying to go in for my
face like I just kind of like turn my
head and we like going for the hug as
her hugging I hear him kind of say like
Oh under his breath I realized ride done
and I was I was so determined to get my
first kiss that night I was like no this
is happening like I'm putting my foot
down no right as we're like pulling away
from the hug I grabbed him I go no wait
and then I kiss him and that's how it
happened I think it was a fairly cute
thing because it could have not happened
but then i was like no wait this is
happening so it happened and that is my
first kiss and then all i remember is
after that happened we're just like okay
bye and then the guys and the girls like
went their separate ways because they
they walked like one way we walked to
the other i feel like i'm imagining this
but I kind of feel like it happened as
we like went our separate ways after
like 10 seconds I remember the guys all
screaming like oh and then we screen and
then they did and we did but we're like
walking away we didn't see each other so
it was just like really cute you're all
like oh it finally happened I don't even
remember if that actually happened I
feel like it did i'm pretty sure that
did happen yeah but that was my first
kiss story there's nothing too exciting
i'm sorry if you guys were expecting
some steamy hot make-out sesh in seventh
grade i don't think i'm gonna share my
first make out story cuz that's it's a
little bit too graphic guys actually
it's not it was probably super awkward
probably more awkward and like my first
kiss story
I would love to hear your guys's stories
especially if you have any awkward funny
situations that happen to you I would
love to hear them so you can just
comment those in the downbar comment
those in the dog Bart note that doesn't
make sense of you guys can leave your
comments down below and I will read them
yes it is now time for Twitter talk so
earlier today I tuned it out asking if
any of you guys have any questions for
me I hate you so I'm going to be
answering a few of those if you ever
want to participate in any of my Twitter
talks then all you have to do is just
follow me on twitter because I randomly
tweet out when I ask four questions so
my twitter is claudia's life and all you
have to do is just use the hashtag um
slumber series let's get started besides
Claud what are some of your other
nicknames I actually have a lot of
nicknames so there's Claude cloud cloudy
cloudy with a chance of meatballs
clodhoppers quadzilla chlamydia Claude
the broad ski ski BBS I think that's
about it next one how tall are you I'm
about 5'4 if you could change your name
to anything what would it be I actually
don't think I would change my name to
anything because I really liked my name
I used to not like it but I like it now
except for the meaning of it if you guys
would like to search it up and see the
meaning of my name other than that I
like my name would you rather have your
legs up to your boobs or legs that stop
at your knees um yeah I think I would do
legs up to your boobs because that do I
have to answer this question if you
could date one person that's on YouTube
who would it be PS love you Claudia
you're the best I'm kind of late on this
but I recently started watching the
Janoskians on youtube I had like no idea
who they were like a month ago but yeah
I started watching them
and if I do say so myself beau brooks is
um it's really cute so I wouldn't mind
dating him um pretty cute I mean isn't
easy I'm eat eat Joss makes my standards
he's it's what's your favorite emoji I
really like this emoji right here I
never use it but I think it's really
pretty and i also like this sequins
right here it's usually followed by like
I'll pound you or like fight me so it
like makes me look tough are you going
to VidCon yes I am and it's like in a
week I think I am very excited it's
going to be my first time going but I
can't even explain how excited I am to
go to that okay well this one's fun
describe your natural body scent
probably like cupcakes and flowers and
candy and possibly how often do you wash
your face brushes um truthfully I don't
remember I do spot clean them though so
it's not like that bad like who has time
to deep wash deep clean their brushes
like no one has time for that what have
you been doing this summer sleeping
eating eating while sleeping that's not
possible favorite photo editing app by
the way I love your videos thank you I
have been really loving the visco cam
app Lauren love Lauren Elizabeth here on
YouTube showed it to me and I just
really like all the filters on it and
stuff so I use that pretty much every
single time I Instagram if you can only
wear one color for the rest of your life
what color would you choose that is
actually a really hard question like I
was thinking about this and I would have
to say either like black because I feel
like black is kind of like appropriate
for most occasions like a black dress or
like black leggings and stuff but that's
just like a lot of black so maybe like
like a cream color like a neutral kind
of beige color or something
no one's really hard and the last
question is how was your first date and
I actually went in full detail about how
my first date went in my last episode so
you can click right here on this little
kissy face picture um and it will take
