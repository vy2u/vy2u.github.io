hello everyone and welcome to episode 5
of sorry I'm not polish on me but
welcome to episode number five of my
summer series and i haven't done one of
these in such a long time and I always
tell myself yes Claudia you're going to
keep on doing this make this a thing and
they never happens but I really really
do like this series so I need to get
into it that's one of my new year's
resolutions since I have not done one of
these episodes in a very long time I'm
sure a lot of you guys have no idea what
this series is about so I quickly wanted
to recap about what the series is about
for those of you guys who are a little
confused and don't really know what to
expect on here so I've actually came up
with this video series because I wanted
to interact with you guys on a more like
personal and creative level which is how
this series came about and I also wanted
to create videos where I can't answer
your guys's questions from Twitter but I
didn't want to just do like Twitter Q&amp;amp;A
cuz a lot of people do that already so I
decided to kind of fit my Twitter Q&amp;amp;A
thing into this video series basically
hey Francis has joined us but anyways
Michael for these episodes is to make
you guys feel like you're having a
virtual sleepover with me so I talk
about whatever I want to in these
episodes I shared yet wise recipes
different like how to things I've shared
stories with you guys I want to do more
challenges on here I've already done
would you rather I was so kind of fun
stuff like that and every single episode
has three segments to it and usually i
keep it at three so the first two are
whatever i want to make it and then the
last one is usually the twitter Q&amp;amp;A so
that is how this whole series works I
know you guys really like these because
I get comments all the time saying where
is your next summer series episode so
I'm really gonna try
guys I'm really gonna try to make this a
thing in 2014 for me so anyways let's
get on to the first segment of today's
episode which is talking about juicing
because I have been talking about
juicing non-stop on my main channel and
my second channel which is young
beauties on TV and one of the biggest
video requests that I get from you guys
is to share my favorite juicing recipes
because you know a lot of people don't
know where to begin with juicing it can
be a little intimidating with all those
fruits and vegetables and I've noticed
that generally I like to stick to the
same recipe and the same types of fruits
and vegetables but every single time I
kind of switch it up a little bit so my
juices are never the same they never
really taste the same because I'm always
switching it up and stuff but today I
want to share with you guys the kind of
general juice that I like to make when I
normally put in my juices what I'm
trying to say so let's get started with
the ingredients that I normally put into
my juices so first off i put in beats
some celery large carrots cucumber
apples to add in that sweetness lemons
and lastly a little bit of ginger so i'm
starting off by turning on my juicer and
putting in my beets and i like to put
the entire thing in stem and leaves
included and i don't know if you guys
noticed but i like to keep a plastic bag
in the garbage container that's in the
back of the machine because it helps
with cleaning up so i'm just putting in
my carrots my cucumber as well as my two
lemons mine were small so i added in two
after that I'm putting in a few stalks
of celery then last but not least the
apples and my measurements are never the
same but I normally make enough to fill
up a large bowl the best part about
juicing is you can really get creative
with your recipes and try out different
ideas so be sure to tweet me with the
hashtag slumber series for a chance to
have your creation featured on my next
episode enjoy your juice within 24 hours
of making it and be sure to store it in
a glass container to keep it fresh the
next segment in today's video is story
time because people like to tell stories
during sleepovers right so today's story
is actually really funny and I've been
meaning to share with you guys for the
longest time because i just love sharing
it it's such a funny story so anyways I
don't really remember how old I was or
what year this was and I was definitely
a lot younger like I'm talking 67 I
don't even know I do have a picture to
go along with this story which i'll show
you guys after I tell it to you because
it's the funniest photo ever but yeah so
i'm guessing i was around like five six
seven eight that's the range that word
we're going to be going in so i was on
vacation in Florida with my family and
we decided to go to the zoo one of the
days and before we went into the zoo we
stopped by this little shop and I had
this little section of toys and little
prank tricks like the little pen zappers
and like the zapping stapler and like
fake poo and all that stuff just kind of
like those little prank toys you guys
know what I'm talking about anyways me
you know being this little young girl
finds this little packet of fake
cigarettes and I'm like oh my god like
this is so cool I need to get these
pretend like I'm smoking cigarettes you
know and they looked very believable
like it looked like a cigarette and like
little flakes on one of the sides I
don't know like they looked pretty legit
and for some reason my parents
okay sure you can buy this now that I'm
thinking of it that is actually terrible
parenting skills but anyways they bought
me the fake cigarettes and that was from
that moment I was the coolest kid ever
because I could pretend to smoke
cigarettes
so once we walked into the zoo I just
remember joking to my cousin and my
brother Kevin about how I'm just going
to pretend smoking in public and see
like how people are gonna react I think
that's the reason why I wanted to buy
them just to do it in public along with
my fake cigarette I also brought this
light purple mini backpack with me I'm
not sure why I did this and I don't know
if my parents knew that I was doing this
but for some reason I decided to bring
my entire life savings in that little
purple backpack what you don't back that
it was only like two hundred dollars but
that's still like a lot of money
especially when you're like a
five-year-old like that takes months to
collect I don't even know how I got two
hundred dollars at that age but anyway
so I had two hundred dollars in that
little backpack and I just remembered
that I was so consumed with that fake
cigarette that I accidentally left my
backpack somewhere in the zoo just
because I was focusing so much on the
cigarette that I probably just left it
on a bench or something and I remember
when I told my parents that I lost my
two hundred dollars and my favorite
backpack ever they were so upset with me
pretty sure they like snatch the fake
cigarette out of my hand and just like
threw it out there like you don't
deserve this face cigarette anymore you
just lost two hundred dollars and that
went from the coolest day ever to the
worst day ever now one of the main
reasons why i want to share the story of
you guys is because of the photo that
goes along with it i'm just gonna look
at it so that while you guys are looking
at it i'm looking at at the same time oh
my god all right here is the beautiful
photo put it up first off let's just
let's just come about the outfit what am
i wearing I'm my glasses look like
they're reading glasses but they're pink
um I'm wearing blue from head to toe
which is great had some heels on I
definitely felt older that day oh you
can see the beautiful backpack that I no
longer had
after taking that photo and most
importantly the fake cigarette oh my god
okay I must say though I did have a
pretty convincing and impressive smoking
stance like the fingers are perfect the
whole like shrug the shoulders oh my god
and then you see my cousin she's doing
like the typical like smile for the
camera having so much fun and then
there's Claudia just bummin this is like
my favorite photo from my entire
childhood if you guys were ever curious
as to how I was back in the day this
photo pretty much sums it up I mean this
is that yeah this defines me I think it
still does now not saying that smoking
that just so that is it for my story I
hope you guys found it somewhat amusing
and entertaining I just thought it was
really funny to share with you guys so
now let's get on with the next topic of
today's episode which is Twitter Q&amp;amp;A so
I actually have not tweeted out yet so
I'm about to do that right now
I tune it out to guys and you guys give
me questions so let's get started what
is your favorite pizza topping I can
only choose one okay I really like
supreme pizza but that has a bunch of
different toppings on it so if I can
only go one I would probably have to say
bacon it might sound weird but it
actually tastes amazing so I'm just
saying how tall are you I am 55 would
you make out with Liam Hemsworth or dad
cute kid Parker hot brilliance is BF
it's ok she won't know well you guys
know how much I love Liam Hemsworth
definitely biggest celebrity crush but
when you weigh those two together Parker
Liam I mean if you guys watch Aspen's
boyfriend tag like he's kind of a hunk I
saw that wink that you gave me too I saw
that on to the next question and you're
going to a house in any three places in
the world where would they be that is
actually a really good question
definitely California London that would
be so much fun and always wanted to
visit London but I've never I've never
left this country but I would love to
live in London and Australia California
London Australia I would say do you wish
to go to Coachella don't even say that
word figuring that I don't live in
California I will not be going but yes
that I'll be so much fun I used to go to
lollapalooza VidCon is during the same
time so I think the music festival gods
are just trying their best not to let me
go to music festivals curse you God's
carrying on how has your day been
face my day has been very good it's been
very productive so far which is great
and it's been a good day thank you now

favorite dessert um anything red velvet

sprinkles ones are excellent cake I've
had red velvet pancakes before anything

episode is what is your favorite song at
the moment and I would have to say my
favorite song at the moment would be at
Trojans by Atlas genius I believe it's
called it's just a really fun and upbeat
song and I really like to dance to it

in a really good mood let's play it why
