of sorry I'm not polish on me but
welcome to episode number 5 of my summer
series and I haven't done one of these
in such a long time and I always tell
myself
yes Claudio you're gonna keep on doing
this make this a thing and it never
happens but I really really do like this
series so I need to get into it that's
one of my new year's resolutions since I
have not done one of these episodes in a
very long time I'm sure a lot of you
guys have no idea what this series is
about so I quickly wanted to recap about
what this series is about for those of
you guys who are a little confused don't
really know what to expect on here so
I've actually came up with this video
series because I wanted to interact with
you guys on a more like personal and
creative level but which is how this
series came about and I also wanted to
create videos where I can't answer your
guys's questions from Twitter but I
didn't want to just do like Twitter Q&amp;amp;A
cuz a lot of people do that already so I
decided to kind of fit my Twitter Q&amp;amp;A
thing into this video series basically
Hey
Francis has joined us but anyways
Michael for these episodes is to make
you guys feel like you're having a
virtual asleep over with me so I talk
about whatever I want to in these
episodes I share DIYs recipes different
like how-to things I've shared stories
with you guys I want to do more
challenges on here I've already done
would you rather I was so kind of fun
stuff like that and every single episode
has three segments to it and usually I
keep it at three so the first two are
whatever I want to make it and then the
last one is usually the Twitter Q&amp;amp;A so
that is how this whole series works I
know you guys really like these because
I get comments all the time saying where
is your next summer series episode so
I'm really gonna try
guys I'm really gonna try to make this a
thing in 2014 for me so anyway it's
let's get on to the first segment of
today's episode which is talking about
juicing because I have been talking
about juicing non-stop on my main
channel and my second channel which is a
beauty star TV and one of the biggest
video requests that I get from you guys
is to share my favorite juicing recipes
because you know a lot of people don't
know where to begin with juicing it can
be a little intimidating with all those
fruits and vegetables and I've noticed
that generally I like to stick to the
same recipe and the same types of fruits
and vegetables but every single time I
kind of switch it up a little bit
so my juices are never the same they
never really taste the same because I'm
always switching it up and stuff but
today I want to share with you guys the
kind of general juice that I like to
make what I normally put in my juices
what I'm trying to say so let's get
started with the ingredients that I
normally put into my juices so first off
I put in beets some celery large carrots
cucumber apples to add in that sweetness
lemons and lastly a little bit of ginger
so I'm starting off by turning on my
juicer and putting in my beets and I
like to put the entire thing in stem and
leaves included and I don't know if you
guys noticed but I like to keep a
plastic bag in the garbage container
that's in the back of the machine
because it helps with cleaning up so I'm
just putting in my carrots my cucumber
as well as my two lemons mine were small
so I added in two
after that I'm putting in a few stalks
of celery then last but not least the
apples and my measurements are never the
same but I normally make enough to fill
up a large bowl the best part about
juicing is you can really get creative
with your recipes and try out different
ideas so be sure to tweet me with the
hashtag slumber series for a chance to
have your creation featured on my next
episode enjoy your juice within 24 hours
of making it and be sure to store it in
a glass container to keep it fresh the
next segment in today's video is story
time because people like to tell stories
during sleepovers right so today's story
is actually really funny and I've been
meaning to share with you guys for the
longest time because I just love sharing
it it's such a funny story so anyways I
don't really remember how old I was or
what year this was and I was definitely
a lot younger like I'm talking six seven
I don't even know I do have a picture to
go along with this story which I'll show
you guys after I tell it to you because
it's the funniest photo ever but yeah so
I'm guessing I was around like five six
seven eight that's the range that word
we're gonna be going in so I was on
vacation in Florida with my family and
we decided to go to the zoo one of the
days and before we went into the zoo we
stopped by this little shop and they had
this little section of toys and little
prank tricks like the little pen zappers
and like the zapping stapler and like
fake poo and all that stuff just kind of
like those little prank toys you guys
know what I'm talking about anyways me
you know being this little young girl
finds this little packet of fake
cigarettes and I'm like oh my god like
this is so cool I need to get these
pretend like I'm smoking cigarettes you
know and they looked very believable
like it looked like a cigarette it had
like little flakes on one of the sides I
don't know like they looked pretty legit
and for some reason my parents were
okay sure you can buy this now that I'm
thinking of it that is actually terrible
parenting skills but anyways they bought
me the fake cigarettes and that was from
that moment I was the coolest kid ever
because I could pretend to smoke
cigarettes
so once we walked into the zoo I just
remember joking to my cousin and my
brother Kevin about how I'm just going
to pretend smoking in public and see
like how people are gonna react I think
that's the reason why I wanted to buy
them just to do it in public along with
my fake cigarette I also brought this
light purple mini backpack with me I'm
not sure why I did this and I don't know
if my parents knew that I was doing this
but for some reason I decided to bring
my entire life savings in that little
purple backpack but you know back then
it was only like two hundred dollars but
that's still like a lot of money
especially when you're like a
five-year-old like that takes months to
collect I don't even know how I got $200
at that age but anyway so I had $200 in
that little backpack and I just
remembered that I was so consumed with
that fake cigarette that I accidentally
left my backpack somewhere in the zoo
just because I was focusing so much on
the cigarette that I probably just left
it on a bench or something and I
remember when I told my parents that I
lost my $200 and my favorite backpack
ever and they were so upset with me
pretty sure they like snatch the fake
cigarette out of my hand and just like
threw it out there like you don't
deserve this fake cigarette of you are
you just lost $200 and that went from
the coolest day ever to the worst day
ever
now one of the main reasons why I want
to share the story with you guys is
because of the photo that goes along
with it I'm just gonna look at it so
that while you guys are looking at it
I'm looking at it at the same time oh my
god alright here is the beautiful photo
put it up first off let's just let's
just comment about the outfit what am I
wearing I'm my glasses look like they're
reading glasses but they're pink I'm
wearing blue from head to toe which is
great had some heels on I definitely
felt older that day oh you can see the
beautiful backpack that I no longer had
taking that photo and most importantly
the fake cigarette oh my god okay I must
say though I did have a pretty
convincing and impressive smoking stance
like the fingers are perfect the whole
like shrug the shoulders oh my god and
then you see my cousin she's doing like
the typical like smile for the camera
having so much fun and then there's
Claudia just bumming this is like my
favorite photo from my entire childhood
if you guys were ever curious as to how
I was back in the day this photo pretty
much sums it up
I mean this is that yeah this defines me
I think it still does now not saying
that I'm smoking that just so that is it
for my story I hope you guys found it
somewhat amusing and entertaining I just
thought it was really funny to share
with you guys so now let's get on with
the next topic of today's episode which
is Twitter Q&amp;amp;A so I actually have not
tweeted out yet so I'm about to do that
right now
I tuned it up to you guys and you guys
give me questions so let's get started
what is your favorite pizza topping I
can only choose one okay I really like
supreme pizza but that has a bunch of
different toppings on it so if I can
only go with the one I would probably
have to say bacon it might sound weird
but it actually tastes amazing so I'm
just saying how tall are you I am five
five who would you make out with Liam
Hemsworth or Dada cute kid Parker hot
brilliance SBF it's okay she won't know
well you guys know how much I love Liam
Hemsworth definitely biggest celebrity
crush but when you weigh those two
together Parker
Liam I mean if you guys watch Aspen's
boyfriend tag like he's kind of a hunk I
saw that wink that you gave me too I saw
that on to the next question and you're
gonna go House in any three places in
the world where would they be that is
actually a really good question
definitely California London that would
be so much fun that always wanted to
visit London but I've never I've never
left this country but I would love to
live in London and Australia California
London Australia I would say do you wish
to go to Coachella don't even say that
word figuring that I don't live in
California I will not be going but yes
that'd be so much fun

think the music festival gods are just
trying their best not to let me go it's
