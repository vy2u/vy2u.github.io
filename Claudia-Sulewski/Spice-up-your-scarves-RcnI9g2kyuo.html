anything about today's video I just
quickly want to say yes I am Tanner and
darker and cupboard and that is because
I went to Florida last weekend's for
just a couple days with my mom and that
was basically my birthday my 15th
birthday present so I just quickly
wanted to mention that before you girls
are like well where did you get that tan
you know so while i was in florida I've
logged a lot every single day so on my
second channel every day I've been
uploading new videos from Florida so I'm
going to have the link to my second
channel in the down bar and I'm also
going to have a link to all of my
florida vlogs so you guys can check
those out they're pretty cute and funny
and I don't know it was really fun to
take my camera around with you guys on
vacation so it's practically like you
girls were there and this video's Lee no
I mean ok so today's video is just going
to be a quick little like I guess
fashion tips scarf tip I don't know and
basically I'm going to teach you guys
how to scarf oh I'm going to teach you
guys how to store your scars in this
special way that makes them look a lot
cooler and just just better I don't know
um so basically ever cromby and
abercrombie fitch hollister like those
three stores they're known for selling
like really big scarves like scars that
are very thin but then they're also very
very huge and I'm talking very long like
you guys and see how big this is so
basically I have two of them I have this
structure on in this white one and when
you get them I think before I same thing
I think I got this technique that I do I
think for my mom or I think they even do
it at the store too i'm not sure but
when you get them this is a bad example
but when you get them there wrinkle free
and they're just kind of flat in their
dole and like they don't really have
that much like life to that
because they're just kind of like flat
scars and I don't know they just like
they look kind of boring when you put
them on because they don't really have
any cool like texture to them or
anything so it's family to two girls how
to store your scarves to make them look
more like this where they have like
those twisted like a wrinkly look which
I think just kind of gives a scarf a
little bit more life and volume and just
kind of gives it like a more interesting
and different look and I absolutely love
the look of like wrinkled scarves like
not wrinkle like accidentally wrinkles
but like on purpose sprinkle scars that
make sense so today I'm going to show
girls how to do this look on your
scarves and I'm going to be showing you
how to do it on this scarf today so the
first thing that you do is hold up your
scarf vertically and put one it and
press down when your feet on the bottom
of the scarf then take the hand that's
holding up the scarf and just start
twisting in any direction it doesn't
really matter but keep on twisting it
and this can take a couple minutes
depending especially on how long your
star vez but just keep on twisting and
twisting it and twisting it just yeah
just keep on testing it and to the point
where it starts getting really tight
that it starts going lower and lower and
lower and by the time we're done your
scarf should be come so twisted that it
starts to like twist itself into a
little knots so basically when you're
done you should have something that
looks like this it in my opinion it kind
of looks like a brain or something or
like just a big jumbled up like not and
then you can just kind of leave your
scarf like that overnight at least
overnight or you know if you just have
it sitting in your closet it actually
takes up less room so if you just store
it that way next time you use it and
unfold it it's going to have really
really pretty like wrinkles and its
really pretty twisted and wrinkly
textures your scarf so that's just one
of my tips on how to kind of like change
up your scarf and just make it look
kinda cuter I don't know I really really
like the look and I'll all these huge
scars they're just really awesome
because if you're cold you can wrap it
around you because they're so big and
like or you can just wear it like this I
don't know there's so
you can like style with these scars so I
definitely recommend getting them and of
course do the tricity thingy and make
them look really awesome when you wear
them so yeah also I quickly want to
mention one more thing for end this
video so you guys know that my 15th
birthday was like kind of on a less
