video I quickly wanted to think Blair or
juicystar 07 here on YouTube because she
recently mentioned me in one of her
recent videos and I had no idea that she
watched my videos so I just I freaked
out a little bit um so Blair if you're
watching this thank you so much for your
kind words and I love your videos and it
made my day so let's just get into the
video so today I'm doing the
spooktacular tag which was created by
all that glitters 21 and I'll actually
tagged me so thank you l for tagging me
and I'm really excited because i really
like these questions so the first one is
do still trick or treat and I don't
sadly I used to love trick-or-treating
but my friends and I don't really go
like I didn't go last year and this year
I'm probably just gonna stay home and
like pass out candy so sadly no I don't
number 2 asks do you like going to
haunted attractions and I love going to
haunted attractions I'll of fondant
houses I love corn mazes I love pumpkin
patches and all that stuff helps me get
into the halloween spirit and i love
being scared number three is your
favorite halloween candy and i actually
have it with me right now because my mom
just bought like a huge bag of it but
they are the caramel apple pops they're
basically apple lollipops with caramel
on top and i love these we get them
every single year around this time and i
just i go through these so fast i
literally like six of them a day which
is really bad the next question is what
is your favorite Halloween movie and it
would for sure have to be halloween town
I'm sorry this lighting is just really
bad but anyways I mentioned that one of
my recent tag videos and I just I grew
up with those movies I really like them
I watching like every year next question
is what is your favorite scary movie I
love scary movies oh my gosh I really
really liked the crazies um that was
just overall a really good like produced
movie i think the plot was really nice
and i also like the hills have eyes and
i really want to see sinister my brother
saw he said it is like a sick movie he
said it was the scariest movie he's ever
seen so i really want to see that the
next question is
what is your favorite costume ever wore
as a child and I was I was a little
hesitant to show you guys this because
it's definitely going to change your
thoughts and opinions about me but um
just you know so I think I was in fourth
grade and I went to a Halloween store
with my family and I found this mask
pretty here and just just take a look at
it just take it all in it's what it
looks like um yeah I was this for
Halloween when I was like in fourth
grade um so apparently i called myself a
gangster so I wore like this really
baggy like Jersey and like begged jeans
and sneakers and then I wore this mask
yeah I know I don't know what I was
thinking at the time it's weird why
would I wear this I don't know alright
that just I was a weird child that was
that was definitely my awkward phase
next question is what is your favorite
fall food and beverage for food I'm not
sure what it's called but I chair Jose
you can buy a bunch of different like
bread mixes there's one that's like
there's like pumpkin and there's
gingerbread i love the gingerbread oh my
god my mom bought it like last week and
i am so excited to make it mom always
buys them every year and we make them at
least like 20 times um during season so
I love those I don't really know the
name but I just I like all of them and
as far as drinks go probably hot
chocolate obviously come on everyone
loves hot chocolate also i really like
hot apple cider what my mom does is she
just buys like I think it's apple spiced
cider or something like that but it's
also from chair joes and it's just in a
juice bottle thing and then I'll just
like put that in my grave and just heat
it up and drink that number nine asks do
you have a festive background on your
phone I lack screen is not very festive
but it's just a picture of my friend
Lucy and I homecoming night we wore like
army clothing that was like the theme of
our party but then for my background
it's just a picture of my fireplace so I
I guess that's pretty festive and also
my computer oh my computer is festive so
this is the background on my computer
and I just found this on google images
but doesn't this photo remind you of
something that you would see on like
Disney Channel Disney would always have
those many like commercials of like
pumpkins like jumping around do you guys
know what I'm talking about like am I
just like making this up but no they
want they would have like little
animations in between like commercial
breaks during like the Halloween time
but that's that's what that photo
reminded me of number 10 is what are you
going to dress up as this year and sadly
nothing because um obviously i'm not
going to your treating so i don't have a
costume for that and i don't think any
of my friends or anyone in my grave is
throwing any like halloween parties to
dress up for so this is really sad but i
don't i don't think i'm gonna be
anything so that's just that's really
depressing number 11 is what would a
pinecone be and I'll already answer that
she said that if you have a pet then you
can just say what your pet would be for
halloween and many of you know that I
have a cat as well and her name is
Frances and she's just the chillest cat
in the world my cat is a huge outdoor
cat she literally spends at least like
75 percent of her day outside so my cat
would probably be either like like a
lion or like a tiger but like at the
same time like a ninja I'm at a place to
clip in right now one time I was eating
breakfast for school and I look outside
literally my cat is on my freaking sense
my fence is like an inch wide at the top
and my cat was literally walking and
sitting on the fence it was the greatest
thing ever so she'd be like a ninja lion
tiger thing the next question is what
candy do have left in your stash after
you eat everything else um probably
whoppers I don't like
that also like thin mints anything like
minty I don't really like that either
the next question is do you decorate
your house and I think we're getting
lamer and lamer every single year
because back in the days when I was
younger my family would literally go
like all out I think starting like five
or six years ago I don't know when we
got it but we got this thing it was like
okay so it's like a figure of like a
person but it's like poles and what we
do is we put like a clown costume on it
and then we had these like gloves that
were like really creepy they're like
mask gloves so they're like fingers so
we slip those on like the armholes I
actually like flogged one time about my
like clown thing but um yeah and then we
also bought this really scary like
really really creepy mask of a clown and
then you put on the top so it basically
just looks like a huge just like killer
clown and I remember this one year I
think was like the first year we got it
we we went all out guys like we
literally like my parents bought like a
smoke machine they bought like strobe
lights and my mom's had a balloon around
the clown's arm so it was really really
creepy like I hated walking by it
because I was so scared when I first got
it but yeah we put it right by our front
door like on our front porch and our
house was always known to be like one of
the scariest on the block because of
that clown like it was life-size and it
was just it was really scary and also my
brother when he was younger just both my
brothers every year they would always
get different masks and just be like a
different masks for Halloween every year
so we have literally like 20 masks just
like chillin in the basement so if you
guys have seen my house and like other
videos it's very like antiquey and like
old-fashioned and stuff so we have a lot
of like statues and like random like
wooden horse statues it's just it's
weird foot I mean no it looks pretty but
anyways so my mom like for halloween
choice takes our old masks and she like
puts them on the statues and it is so
creepy at night time when you're like
walking by and there's like a horse head
with like blood everywhere
or no if I think it's like a donkey or a
hog or something I don't know we have
this weird animal mask we've got like a
Chucky mask I mean we've we've got the
gangster over here she puts it on our
little chef in her kitchen but um I
don't know this year my mom didn't
really decorate our house as much so
that's that's kind of sad but we used to
get really into it next question is
pumpkin patches corn mazes or hay rides
and I would have to say corn mazes we
used to go to this one corn maze every
year gonna go this you're either we
didn't do like anything this year this
is so sad but it was like a huge corn
maze the maze actually drew out a
picture and it would take you like an
hour to get through the maze with a map
so yeah my answer is corn mazes I love
them the last question is going to a
corn maze what do you wear I would
probably wear some old like ugg boots
because you get very very muddy and
dirty probably some jeans or leggings
and chunky sweater no actually no I'd
probably get a dirty so maybe like a
north face or something um but yeah that
is it for the spooktacular tag I hope
you guys enjoyed it I think it was
really fun to film so i will talk to you
guys for another video and once again
thank you all for tagging me oh and i
tag anyone else wants to do it I know
that halloween is coming pretty soon so
I don't know but if you guys do want to
do it then you can leave it down below
as the video response and that's it so i
will talk to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
