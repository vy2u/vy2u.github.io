hair because it is wet I just took a
shower like 20 minutes ago so it is
still drying but today I'm going to be
doing my spring beauty haul and I'm
really excited to do this because I feel
like I never film beauty halls just
because I never buy a bunch of makeup
during like one time you're in um so
we're just going to get right into it so
first off I got to the EOS spring
collection I don't know and it comes
with two of the EOS lip balms the pink
one and the purple one pink one is
strawberry sorbet and the purple one is
passion fruit already smell these before
I found this video because I was so
excited but they smell just like fruit
smoothies and I love EOS lip balms next
up I got to face products from Revlon
the first one is the Revlon Photoready
BB cream I feel like lately I've just
been so over like foundation because
it's just very thick and I normally just
wear either concealer and like a powder
or I'll just wear some BB cream so I've
never tried this one before so tell me
what you guys think of it but I got it
in the shade light medium and then I
also got to their stick concealer which
looks like this i also had this
concealer in the shade medium but it's a
little bit too dark for me right now so
i decided to pick up the shade lights
medium and i love this concealer so much
definitely try it out if you guys are
looking for one because it just bring it
brings friends it blends really well and
I don't know I just think it's great
coverage so I got those two and then
also I got two lip products the first
one is the Revlon lip butter in
creamsicle and this is my second one of
almost all my first one but I honestly
use this every single day it is such I'm
actually wearing it right now but it's
just such a nice lip color and I don't
know it's just really nice it's nice
then I also decided to try out the
Maybelline Color whispers this is my
first one and I got soft no go nude and
it looks kind of dark because I was
already looking at it but then when I
swatch on my hand
like very very translucent so I'm not
really sure how that's going to turn out
I would you guys like my little fake
rings know if you can see them but I was
drawing fake rings in class today um so
I don't know how this product will turn
out but I guess we'll see and then also
I got the Urban Decay eyeliner this is
the 24-7 glide on eye pencil and this is
in perversion this is my number one
favorite eyeliner I just ran out of the
one else currently using it's really
great for the upper lash line as well as
the waterline so there is a swatch of it
and it's very very pigmented which is
what I like most about it then I also
got the benefit fine 11 um cheek blush
highlighter thing I don't know what you
would consider this but it's actually
really really cool and it's one of their
newest products so it looks like this
and we just take the cap off and you can
roll it up like that um in here let me
zoom in for you guys it looks like that
so as you can see there's the highlight
there is the blush color and there's
kind of like a contour color and you
basically swept it across your cheeks
and just blend it out so this will be
great for the summer and spring time
when you don't really want to you know
kick on and you like pottery blush or
anything so it'll be super easy and you
know next up I decided to try out the
covergirl clump crusher because everyone
is talking and raving about this mascara
so I will let you guys know if I'm like
it or not and I got it in the color very
black next up i got a Revlon lip gloss
and this is I don't know what they're
called I feel like they're like the
illustrious lip gloss or something but
this is in the shade pinkpop Lauren or
velu fully loaded recommended this
lipgloss and she said it's like one of
her favorite drugstore lip glosses so I
want to try it out and um it's really
nice as of what i can tell stuff I got
the Urban Decay Naked basics iPad
and it's so little I don't even know
it's going to be this cute in person so
this is what it looks like as you can
see there are more lighter shades than
darker ones but I thought this would be
great for like every day I it blah I I
can't talk today I makeup looks and I'm
not just very cute I'm very excited for
it feel like I'm excited for everything
next up I got the benefit blush in
coralista and I feel like this is one of
those like classic blushes that everyone
knows except for me so I finally decided
to pick it up and I'm very excited to
use this for it d summertime next up i
got a teasing comb from chi because it
was on sale and I've never owned a
teasing comb before so let's see how
this goes i think i'm going to try right
now i think it looks nice definitely so
i got that next up i got a facial washer
brush thing andreaschoice always talks
about these are like the little circular
um face brushes and I've never used one
of these so I decided to pick it up and
it was like four dollars to be so super
inexpensive and then the last thing that
I want to show you guys I actually did
not buy this but my mom did and I saw it
in the kitchen and it is the coolest
thing ever so I wanted to include it in
today's video it is the vaseline spray
and go moisturizer so it is a lotion
that sprays whoever came up with this is
literally so smart and it's awesome I'll
just show you guys how to use it why not
so you spray it on your arm kind of like
sunscreen and then you build it again so
yeah I think this is like the coolest
thing ever it's super fast and quick and
it also dries very fast because it has
like a lot of water in it too so yeah oh
and then also I got this adorable little
like sampled the hello flawless
foundation from I think benefits and
it's
oh it's so cute and little so that is it
for today's spring beauty haul I hope
you guys enjoyed it and I will talk to
you guys there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
