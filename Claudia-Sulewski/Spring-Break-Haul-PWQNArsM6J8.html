gone around the spring break time and
yeah so it's kind of like a collective
haul to so some of the stuff I don't
really remember like the price of them

really have anything else to say and
this is kind of going to be a long haul
so I just want to get right into it so
first I'm going to show you guys what I
got at nordstrom rack it's only one
thing but it's this headband right here
and I think it's so cute it's like has
crochet and it's really cute like
diamond flower detailing and I loved it
so much I love wearing this with a high
messy bond and it's so cute so yeah I
got that at nordstrom rack so then my
next piece is from jewelmint it's my
newest one and I'm so excited for this
one you guys probably all know enjoyment
is it's like a monthly subscription
website where you have like a showcase
and you like take a test and they find
out like you're a little Julie style and
why am I telling miss you guys obviously
know what it's about but if you've never
tried out gentlemen before definitely
recommend it they're like Julie is
really really good quality compared to
like forever 21 and stuff so it will
last long time and I personally love it
so yeah I'm going to have their link in
the downbar so that you guys can check
it out but let me show you guys what I
got so it looks like this it's super
simple but that's why I love it so it's
like a gold chain bracelet and some of
the chains are like have like a matte
finish to them and some of them are more
shiny and there's like little circle
details and i love it so much so I'm
really excited to wear this because you
know it's so simple and it'll go with a
lot of things and this is the cinema
americano bracelet there you go we gonna
be one of my favorites for the spring
and summertime so while i was in florida
i went to marshalls and i picked up two
things so the first thing is a bathing
suit and this is the top it's adorable
it's a strapless with a tie and it's by
the brand abs and it was only twenty
four dollars which is crazy
it's so pretty it has like rose details
on it in this little gold detail right
here in the middle and then the bottoms
just look like this so they have that
cute detailing on the side and oh my
gosh this bathing suit looks so pretty
when you're tan because it's so bright
and colorful and I'm just step up with
it and then also I got white converse
I've always wanted white Congress but I
never liked once it bought them I don't
know why but when US Marshals I saw that
when I was like oh my gosh I need to get
them so I got him I think they're like
30 bucks or something but they're just
white converse also if you guys have
seen any of my Florida vlogs then you
probably will recognize some of the
clothing pieces that I'm showing today
because I did wear a lot of my newest
clothes in Florida so you're probably
going to recognize some of the stuff but
I've never talked about amount here so
that's why I'm including them in this
hall so I have two things from Windsor
store calm so the first thing is this
crochet top you guys have seen me wear
this and it just looks like this I like
wearing it with a black bandeau and the
shoulder has really nice like stringy
detailing so there's that and then the
other shirt from Windsor is this one
right here and it's more of a darker
kind of beige color and it has the
fringes on the bottom and it's just
crochet and I love this shirt so much
it's so pretty for like the beach or the
bandeau or whatever so then I only have
two things from forever 21 which is
really surprising but the first thing
are these high waisted shorts are here I
love them they're navy blue color and
they have for like metal buttons going
on each side and I really like the way
they fit so I got those and then also
this shirt that i got from there looks
like this it's a little bit see-through
and it's white polka dotted and it has a
collar and it's sleeveless and it's
cropped and it's so cute with like a
black bandeau and like high-waisted
shorts like white shorts yeah looks like
that so the next stuff that I'm going to
be showing you guys is all from pacsun
and recently I've become obsessed with
tax on and it's definitely my favorite
store now and most the stuff that
to be showing you guys I bought all
online because I'm just an online
shopper I like online shopping better
than shopping in real life I think I got
like one thing at store but you are most
likely to find all this stuff offline so
yeah for online okay so the first dress
is this one right here and it's just a
tight dress and it's tribal prints so
it's so cute it looks so nice with a you
know really nice tan the back has this
really pretty d tang right here with the
three like stripes and yeah I love this
then I also got this Jean vest which I
am obsessed with I'm definitely going to
be doing a how I style Jean best video
with this so this I think it's an online
exclusive so I just recently got it so
I'm sure you can still get it but it's
kind of like a light colored denim and
it's cropped and it's so adorable oh my
gosh I love it can't wait to wear it
during the summertime then I also got
these shorts from black poppy and
they're just lace in their white and
they're super cute they were twenty-five
dollars and they look like that you can
also get them in black too next I have
this kind of wide over the shoulder
nutty thing I actually wore this in my
newest video and it's by the brand Roxy
and I love it because it has this
awesome like lace detailing on the side
right here which you can like see
through and it goes all the way up to
the armpit and they have that on both
sides it's just such a pretty like
bright vibrant coral color and this will
be really cute for those cold summer
nights next up I have this shirt right
here and in the front it's super simple
it's just black and sort of see through
and then in the back it's sick I love
this shirt so much so going all the way
to the bottom it has like this what is
this called like grid detailing it's
like horizontal and vertical lines and I
love this shirt so much it looks awesome
with a band oh I love wearing it with
like jeans and like black flats and yeah
this is actually what I wore on my last
night in Florida so you guys have
probably already seen this shirt so the
next shirt is this one right here and
it's just pink it's a high low cut shirt
goes lower in the back and it is a nice
like kind of tribal theme going in the
front and then the back has a really
nice cut out detailing as you can see
and yeah it just looks like that so that
I have a couple of Tanks that i bought
from pecs on so the first one is this
one it's also tribal and it has that
little tie in the front I love shirts
that tie in the front I think it's so
cute and I just really liked the colors
so I actually wore this last night so my
next sharp might look a little bit
familiar yeah I did buy this shirt in
the green turquoise color and I loved it
so much and when I saw that they also
had a red one online I had to buy it
because I think the red one is also so
cute so um God has like the little
ruffles on one side and then it's plain
on the other and I'm on love with this
shirt and a great one so last shirt from
pacsun looks like this and it's just a
craft like navy blue color and it has
swimming goes all over it with a little
front pocket and I really like this like
white shorts or whatever so I forgot one
more thing that I got at pacsun and it's
just black romper right here and it has
such pretty material or detailing it's
like lace and flowery and it looks so
cute it has pockets and this is by the
brand's Billabong which I'm obsessed
with I love billabong but too bad their
stuff is really expensive i think this
was like forty four dollars but i
couldn't resist it was so cute so yeah
it's just spaghetti strapped and it
looks like that so i just got two more
miscellaneous things so the first one is
from beth and body works and it's a mini
ten-dollar candle and this is in the
scent peach bellini so it looks like
that I'm obsessed with this smell I only
burned it once so far I love it so much
it smells so good it reminds me so much
of Florida I feel like anything tropical
just reminds me of Florida I don't know
why but yeah i definitely recommend this
candle and then also while i was in
florida at the gift shop I've had a
voodoo doll I feel like sharing that
with you guys this is my school wallet
this is what I keep like Mike's clydie
and lunch money in so I have like my
keychain my mini pink like coin wallet
and
my voodoo doll matches because she's
pink so yeah and also in Florida I got a
bunch of different clothing from like
one of the gift stores but I'm not going
