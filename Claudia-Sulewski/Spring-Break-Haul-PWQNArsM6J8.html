showing you guys my spring make all so
it's basically all the stuff that I've
gone around the spring break time and
yeah so it's kind of like a collective
haul too so some of the stuff I don't
really remember like the price of them
and stuff like that but yeah I don't
really have anything else to say and
this is kind of going to be a long haul
so I just want to get right into it so
first I'm going to show you guys what I
got at Nordstrom Rack it's only one
thing but it's this headband right here
and I think it's so cute it's like has
crochet and its really cute like diamond
flower detailing and I love it so much
I love wearing this with a high messy
bond and it's so cute so yeah I got that
at Nordstrom Rack so then my next piece
is from jewel mint it's my newest one
and I'm so excited for this one you guys
probably all know what jewel mint is
it's like a monthly subscription website
where you have like a showcase and you
like take a test and they find out like
you're a little Julie style and why am I
telling this you guys obviously know
what it's about but if you've never
tried out gentlemen before definitely
recommend it they're like Julie is
really really good quality compared to
like forever 21 and stuff so it will
last long time and I personally love it
so yeah I'm gonna have their link in the
downbar so that you guys can check it
out but let me show you guys what I got
so it looks like this it's super simple
but that's why I love it so it's like a
gold chain bracelet and some of the
chains are like have like a matte finish
to them and some of them are more shiny
and there's like little circle details
and I love it so much so I'm really
excited to wear this because you know
it's so simple and it'll go with a lot
of things and this is the cinema
Americano bracelet there you go is there
gonna be one of my favorites for the
spring and summertime so while I was in
Florida I went to Marshalls and I picked
up two things
so the first
as a bathing suit and this is a top it's
adorable it's a strapless with a tie and
it's by the brand abs and it was only
$24 which is crazy because it's so
pretty it has like rows details on it
and this little gold detail right here
in the middle and then the bottoms just
look like this so they have that cute
detailing on the side and oh my gosh
this bathing suit looks so pretty when
you're tan because it's so bright and
colorful and I'm just stuck with it and
then also I got white converse I've
always wanted what Congress but I never
like once it bought them I don't know
why but without some marshals I saw that
I was like oh my gosh I need to get them
so I got um I think they're like 30
bucks or something but they're just
white Congress also if you guys have
seen any of my Florida vlogs then you
probably will recognize some of the
clothing pieces that I'm showing today
because I did wear a lot of my newest
clothes in Florida so you're probably
gonna recognize some of the stuff but
I've never talked about them on here so
that's why I'm including them in this
haul so I have two things from Windsor
store calm so the first thing is this
crocheted top you guys have seen me wear
this and it just looks like this I like
wearing it with a black band oh and the
shoulder has really nice like stringy
detailing so there's that and then the
other shirt from Windsor is this one
right here and it's more of a darker
kind of beige color and it has the
fringes on the bottom and it's just
crochet and I love this shirt so much
it's so pretty for like the beach or the
bando or whatever so then I only have
two things from forever 21 which is
really surprising but the first thing
are these high-waisted shorts right here
I love them they're navy blue color and
they have four like little buttons going
on each side and I really like the way
they fit so I got those and then also
this shirt that I got from there looks
like this it's a little bit see-through
and it's white polka dotted and it has a
collar and it's sleeveless and it's
cropped and it's so cute with like a
black window and like high-waisted
shorts like white shorts and yeah looks
like that so then
stuff that I'm going to be showing you
guys is all from PacSun and recently
I've become obsessed with PacSun and
it's definitely my favorite store now
and most of the stuff that I'm going to
be showing you guys I bought all online
because I'm just an online shopper I
like online shopping better than
shopping in real life I think I got like
one thing at store but you are most
likely to find all the stuff offline so
yeah or online okay so the first dress
is this one right here and it's just a
tight dress and it's tribal prints so
it's so cute it looks so nice with a you
know really nice tan the back has this
really pretty detailing right here with
the three like stripes and yeah I love
this then I also got this Jean vest
which I am obsessed with I'm definitely
going to be doing a how I style Jean
vest video with this so this I think
it's an online exclusive so I just
recently got it so I'm sure you can
still get it but it's kind of like a
light colored denim and it's cropped and
it's so adorable oh my gosh I love it
can't wait to wear it during the
summertime then I also got these shorts
from black poppy and they're just lace
in their white and they're super cute
they were $25 and they look like that
you can also get them in black too next
I have this kind of wide over the
shoulder and nutty thing I actually wore
this in my newest video and it's by the
brand Roxie and I love it because it has
this awesome like lace detailing on the
side right here which you can like see
through and it goes all the way up to
the armpit and they have that on both
sides and it's just such a pretty like
bright vibrant coral color and this will
be really cute for those cold summer
nights next up I have this shirt right
here and in the front it's super simple
it's just black and sort of see-through
and then in the back
it's sick I love this shirt so much so
going all the way to the bottom it has
like this was this called like grid
detailing it's like horizontal and
vertical lines and I love this shirts so
much it looks awesome with the band oh I
love wearing it with like jeans and like
black flats and yeah this is actually
what I wore at my last night
in Florida so you guys have probably
already seen this shirt so the next
shirt is this one right here and it's
just pink it's a high low-cut shirt so
it goes lower in the back and there's a
nice like kind of tribal theme going in
the front and then the back has a really
nice cutout detailing as you can see and
yeah it just looks like that so then I
have a couple of Tanks that I bought
from PEC some so the first one is this
one it's also tribal and it has that
little tie in the front I love shirts
that tie in the front I think it's so
cute and I just really liked the colors
so I actually wore this last night so my
next sharp might look a little bit
familiar yeah I did buy this shirt in
the green turquoise color and I loved it
so much and when I saw that they also
had a red one online I had to buy it
because I think the red one is also so
cute so dad has like the little ruffles
on one side and then it's plain on the
other and I'm in love with this shirt
and the green one so last shirt from
PacSun looks like this and it's just
like wrapped like navy blue color and it
has swimming goes all over it with a
little front pocket and apparently like
this with like white shorts or whatever
so I forgot one more thing that I got at
PAX ah and it's just black romper right
here and it has such pretty material or
detailing it's like lace and flowery and
it looks so cute it has pockets and this
is by the brands Billabong which I'm
obsessed with I love both on but too bad
their stuff is really expensive I think
this was like $44 but I couldn't resist
it was so cute so yeah it's just
spaghetti straps and it looks like that
so I just got two more miscellaneous
things so the first one is from betta
body works and it's a mini $10 candle
and this is in the scent peach Bellini
so it looks like that I'm obsessed with
this amount
I only burned it once so far I love it
so much it smells so good it reminds me
so much of Florida I feel like anything
tropical just reminds me of Florida I
don't know
but yeah I definitely recommend this
candle and then also while I was in
Florida at the gift shop I've had a
voodoo doll I feel like sharing that
with you guys
um this is my school wallet this is what
I can't like Mike's clydie and lunch
money n um so I have like my keychain my
mini pink like coin wallet and my voodoo
doll matches because she's pink so yeah
and also in Florida I got a bunch of
different clothing from like one of the
gift stores but I'm not gonna mention in
today's video just because I already
kind of made a haul on my last or in a
blog so if you want to see what else I
bought in Florida then I will leave my
last Florida vlog in the downbar and I
mentioned at the end of the video so you
can see what I got in Florida but yeah
that's it for today's video and I hope
you guys enjoyed it and yeah I'll talk
to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
