doing at my spring fashion haul and you
guys will see that pretty much
everything that I've recently gotten is
for the warmer weather which it's still
like snowing where I live right now but
I'm just very very excited for the
warmer seasons this is kind of a
collective haul because some of the
things that I will be showing you I got
a long time ago and you might actually
be able to recognize some of them
because I've already worn a few of these
pieces in altar videos so we're just
gonna get right into it so first I'm
gonna start out by showing you guys two
things that I got from chic Nova calm I
have been getting stuff from there for
the past few months I think and I just
really like the website because it's
very different it has a lot of different
uniquor pieces that you wouldn't see at
like forever 21 and stuff so I just got
two things so that's why I want to start
out with that website just to get it out
of the way I'm so first off I got these
shorts right here and they're like
oversized one size fits all high-waisted
shorts and they're obviously ombre but
the kind of like more dip dye ish but I
liked how they wear mostly white and the
fact that they're kind of like oversized
I think looks really cute especially
with like a thin black belt that's like
super tight and then it's kind of like
baggy so I'm really excited to wear
these over the summertime and then the
other thing I got is super simple it's
just this white like quarter sleeve
quarter length sleeve shirt and it's
kind of a high-low it's pretty long and
I just liked it because this is the
perfect shirt to tie on the side so now
I'm gonna show you guys a few of the
things that I got from Windsor store
comm so first off I got two pairs of
shoes and the first pair are so cute I
cannot wait to rock these during the
warmer season because they're definitely
like springy summery heels so it looked
like this out they kind of remind me of
Jeffrey Campbell Lita's so they have
like that leathery finish and kind of
like the wood looking chunky heel of
course the hidden platform and
just think these are so fun because
they're kind of like a dusty rosy baby
pink color so I think this will be
really great with very neutral outfits
and stuff so I really love those then I
got these heels right here which are
super crazy and sparkly but I'm actually
collaborating with Windsor for the prom
season so I did get a dress but I won't
show you guys that yet you guys will see
that in the future but I did get these
heels to go with the dress and I'm
obsessed with them their platform and
they're obviously very very sparkly so I
think these are beautiful next up I got
a skirt from Windsor and it looks like
this it's so cute oh my gosh it also
kind of has like this tribal prints
going on and I already tried this on and
it looks perfect with like a cropped
fitted white tee and combat boots oh my
gosh I just I'm so thrilled about this
skirt I can't wait next up I got this
denim button-up shirt it's like a little
crappie toughy thing with the time the
fronts and it buttons down it's ombre
and I thought this would go perfectly
with some high-waisted shorts just to
make it very simple you know outfit
during the summertime so I think this is
so cute
less clothing item that I got from there
were these high-waisted faux leather
like looking leggings oh my gosh I know
I'm kind of late on the trend because
they were really popular like during the
fall time and stuff but I don't care I'm
so excited I just I don't know why I
never ended up buying them but I'm very
happy these are really nice Claudie
because they have these little stretchy
bands on the side so it really kind of
like makes your waist look very skinny
and it also fits really nicely and snug
on your hips so I'm very very happy
about these then I also got these little
earrings and you probably can't see that
there you go and these are to go with
the dress that I got so can't show you
that yet but yes I got those and then
also I got this little set I don't think
I'm in focus Emma so earrings look like
this they're like little skulls and
they're kind of big so I don't really
know how I'm gonna wear these yet but
I'm obsessed with the necklace
just like the same exact thing except a
little bit bigger and I thought it was
very pretty because it's like a bronze
kind of dirty gold looking color and I
don't have any jewelry in this color so
love the head next I got two shirts from
PacSun and they were super inexpensive
because they were already on sale and
then there was also like an additional
50% off sale items or something like
that so the first shirt I got looks like
this it's very simple it's just a floral
long-sleeve shirt I wanted to wear this
today but I wanted to show you guys it
in the hall so yeah looks like that then
also I got this white shirt which
reminds me a lot of free people because
at the top it kind of has like a little
crochet you know detail right there but
then on the sleeves it has the same like
crochet material and free people does
this with a lot of their long sleeve
shirts so when I saw this I was like oh
I have to get it so I'm very excited to
wear that then I also got one shirt from
forever 21 and I bought this for the
summertime it's just a little black lace
crop top it's very simple to wear
underneath something or with
high-waisted shorts or with a
high-waisted skirt really anything it's
very versatile so that's why I like it
and it's also very soft on the inside so
the quality of this shirt is really nice
everything else that I'm about to show
you guys is from Toby comm and I have
been shopping on that website like crazy
I've been loving it lately because it's
kind of expensive ish I mean it has it
kind of various like some stuff are
really inexpensive and some are really
expensive but they have a really really
really good deals like for example your
first purchase is everything 50% off so
my first purchase from there I literally
bought $400 worth of stuff but I saved
$200 and only had to spend 200 so yeah I
will be showing a few of the things that
I got during that purchase and then also
having a sale during like Valentine's
Day or something I think it was like 40%
off your whole like entire purchase so
first I'm going to show you guys two
little tanks and they're pretty
obnoxious but I just I couldn't help it
I thought they were very cute so the
first one is like a little muscle tea
and it says LA and there's like little
sunset on the letters I don't know I
thought he was really cute the next one
is like super obnoxious but I just I
really like the back of it so it looks
like this it's white and it has little
crosses everywhere so you know I'm so
trendy with my little crosses and I'm
sorry this shirt is kind of dirty I just
whatever but the back is awesome it like
twists on the sides and then it has an
entire open back so it looks really
really cool and yeah I really like this
next up I got a pair of pants slash
leggings from them I wouldn't really
consider them leggings because they are
super super thick they're not
see-through at all but they kind of look
like leggings so that's where they're
not like pants I don't know what you
call these but they look like this
they're like a dark blackish gray stone
wash color and then as you can see here
on the thighs they have like this
striped texture going down and they have
that on both legs and I just think these
pants are really cool they remind me of
like punk like motorcycle you know stuff
I don't know uh-huh but yeah these I've
already won them once and I got a bunch
of compliments on them so I got those
next up I got this white button-down
shirt that fades into a dark like
turquoise a teal color
it's so awesome the sleeves are rolled
up halfway and I think it's so cool I
already wore this in one of my videos
but the thing is it's a medium and I
ordered it in a small but for some
reason it came in the wrong size and I
was just way too lazy to send it back
and order any one so I'm just kind of
stuck with this medium one which kind of
sucks but whatever um then I have a few
of dresses to show you guys so the first
is very cute and simple it's a
long-sleeve dress that's tight and short
like that but on the shoulders it has
like little crocheted detailing how cute
is that yeah I love their dresses
they're so so so so cute
next up I got this black dress right
here which is the sickest dress I've
ever owned this is like by far my most
favorite purchase so it cuts right
underneath like the boob area and it has
these little like metal pull things I
don't know what they're called but it
goes all the way around and it also
zippers down and it is beautiful it's
just very flowy and short and I'm
definitely bringing this to me on a
spring break for Orlando it's like I got
this white dress which I've seen
everywhere I've seen this on Nasty Gal
like I think necessary clothing ganjang
calm tobe calm so you can find this
dress like everywhere but it looks like
this it's very white and flowy and it
buttons down and then right here it's
got like mesh and crochet and I just
think it's so like delicate and girly
looking and it's the perfect dress for
the summer and spring time and then the
last or no I have two more doses the
second to last dress that I want to show
you guys it looks like this it's like a
yellowy peachy color
and it kind of has like a little v-neck
but as you go down it fades to like a
navy blue indigo which color I brought
this to Hawaii with me and I love it
it's the perfect like sundress to put
over a bathing suit or you know anything
like that and then the last dress that I
got from Toby comm is different you know
I definitely will not wear this just for
like fun but I wanted to buy it because
it was on sale for super inexpensive it
was like I feel like it was like 12
dollars or something I'm not really sure
but I decided that I wanted to buy this
dress for Halloween so this is going to
be my halloween costume next or no this
year so at the top it's just black and
simple and then it's a watermelon how
cute is that
so obviously I'm not going to wear this
like when I'm hanging out a friend
but I think this is really cute for like
Halloween so I could just you know be
like a watermelon
whatever it's so I'm really excited for
that it looks really cute on then also I
have a few and jewelry pieces that I
want to show you I really like Toby coms
jewelry pieces as well the first one is
a set of rings I have another one that's
similar but I can't find it but it looks
like this a lot of you guys saw these on
my outfit of the week videos and you
really like them they're just like thick
silver rings and I think they're very
cute
so I got those from Toby and then also I
got a bunch of different little like
delicate necklaces the first one is
silver and it's just like a little
triangle I've been wearing this like
every single day I'm not even kidding
I'm obsessed with it
and then also I got a little gold one
and it's like a little sideways cross
you can see that like a little chubby
cross so I've been really liking this
one as well so that is it for my haul
video I hope you guys enjoyed it and I
will talk to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
