today's video I'm going to be talking
about the floral trend because spring is
pretty yes spring is here and I've been
seeing a lot of people rock the floral
trend which gets me really excited so in
today's video I'm going to be showing
you guys how do we create these floral
inspired nails they're very simple and
easy to recreate after you guys watch
today's now tutorial I'm going to show
you an outfit that compliments and is
inspired by these nails so let's get on
with the tutorial I'm starting off by
using the Sally Hansen triple shine
polish in the color reef ref and
applying it all over my nails with the
ultimate shields complex in this polish
your nails will stay shiny and protected
all day this stuff defends against salt
water tap water and chlorinated water so
I'm just going in and applying on two
coats to all of my nails
next up I'm using my triple shine polish
in the color vanity flare combined with
my Sally Hansen I hard nail art kit and
I'm just going in and starting to draw
out the flowers on my ring finger and my
thumb and to achieve this effect all you
have to do is create circles with small
curved lines you got to add some leaves
to your flowers so I'm going in with the
triple shine polish any color kelp out
and once again using that same tool I'm
just starting to create some green
leaves next to my flowers and I'm just
kind of filling in whatever gaps I have
to make the nail look a little more
detailed lastly I'm going in with my
Sally Hansen triple shine polish in the
color lemon shark and creating one small
dot in the middle of every flower just
to add a little bit more detail and
color to do nail art alpha time for
starters I threw on this black crop top
from misguided which has thin white
stripes on the collar and sleeves then I
threw on this colorful and fun jacket
from nasty gal which really helped to
tie in the colors on my nails for the
bottoms I decided to keep it casual by
wearing some light wash jean shorts with
some all black sneakers both from go
Jane
that is it for today's video I hope you
guys enjoyed it and I will see you guys
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
