apply on two shades of my soy and nail
polish in the shade melee and I love
this nail polish it's so pretty for
spring it's a part of their spring 2013
collection and it also has a healthy
formula making it 5 free and vegan
friendly which is always good I love
this color because it's very pastel and
opaque and it's just great for this time
of year it's very important to keep your
hair moisturized and protected from the
Sun so I'm starting out by brushing out
my hair then applying it macadamias
healing oil treatment and this
lightweight formula is non-greasy it
moisturized and strengthens your hair it
also has natural UV protection so it's
just overall very great for your hair
and you can apply it to the ends of your
hair when it's wet or dry so I'm just
applying it here and then just brushing
out my hair once again now for my arms
and legs i'm using the pacifica coconut
crushed pearl luminizing body butter and
this stuff smells so good it leaves your
skin hydrated and youthful and glowing
and it also is full of crushed pearls
which kind of gives it this nice shimmer
look to it
for makeup I'm starting out by taming my
eyebrows with my Anastasia clear brow
gel and this stuff is perfect for any
hair color because it is clear and this
stuff just helps to set and define and
shape your brows and just keep them from
moving around all day so as you can see
here I'm just brushing the gel through
my eyebrows after that I'm grabbing any
eyeshadow primer and just applying it
all over my lids then grabbing a topi
medium toned eyeshadow I am going to
apply that all over my lids as well and
I'm also going to be dragging up that
same exact color into my crease grabbing
my Urban Decay moon dust I shadow in the
shade at Diamond dog I'm going to use
this for my upper lash line as well as
my lower lash line and let me tell you
guys this I shadow is so sparkly it
looks so pretty in the sunlight it has
intense hues and micro-fine sparkles
which just make it very shimmery so as
you can see I'm just putting it on the
top and bottom and then grabbing a big
fluffy brush to blend everything out
now I am just applying on some mascara
to open up my eyes and lengthen my
lashes now of course we cannot forget
about the lips so today I'm using my
juice beauty reflecting gloss in fig and
I'm just going to apply this all over my
lips this lip gloss is made with
certified organic ingredients with
different oils and minerals in it that
helps you nourish your lips and give
them a really pretty color and shine
everyone so before I end off today's
video I would like to announce a few
exciting things so most of the products
that were featured in today's video are
actually from the may 2013 hip see glam
bag called Spring Fling that being said
I have recently become a part of the
Ipsy beauty community which is so
exciting because every month I'm going
to be creating my own looks using the
Ipsy glam bags and i will be posting
them on youtube for you guys so for
those of you guys who are subscribed to
the Ipsy glam bags then you can recreate
the looks that i make or you can just
come below and tell me how you guys
strap the products so i think it's going
to be really fun now since i am a part
of the Ipsy team i will be at the
generation beauty event which is going
to take place on june first in june
second at LA live which is located in
Los Angeles I will have all the
information in the downbar as well as
the links to their website but it is
basically just going to be a beauty
event where us girls can all come
together and talk about makeup and hair
and everything beauty so I think it's
gonna be really great so for those of
you who are located in the LA area then
definitely try to get your hands on some
tickets so that you can meet me and a
bunch of other you to beauty crews i
will be hosting one of the workshops at
the event as well as having my own
little meet-and-greet so I'm very
excited for that and also if C is
allowing me to give free tickets to you
guys so they're going to be five winners
and you're going to win two tickets to
the event now keep in mind if C is not
going to pay for any travel or hotel
expenses so if you know you can't make
it to the event then don't enter and try
to give someone else a better chance to

time then I definitely recommend
entering because I would love to meet
