I'm so sorry I haven't made a video in
so long but you know what I'm here now
so that's good you guys should be
expecting a lot more videos because that
it's not going to happen again at least
for a very long time because that was
bad bad call yeah
what's a call so if you saw my most
recent video that I posted like during
the week a couple days ago I think you
guys would know that I went to Florida
for eight nights so I pretty much spent
my entire spring break in Florida not
pretty much but I did spend my entire
spring break in Florida and it was so
much fun I blogged every day so if you
guys follow me on my second channel then
you would be seeing what we've been
doing every day at least most of it so
this video might be a little bit short
but I've never actually seen somebody do
this video on YouTube like I was trying
to search it up and I couldn't really
find any I feel like nobody ever talks
about this but it's how to stay
organized while you're on vacation
because what attempts to pack and unpack
I'm like super organized with that I
never really had a problem with that but
then when it comes to being on vacations
like you don't want to put everything
and fold everything away and it's just
you get really lazy and you're just
shuffling like through all your clothes
and your students like suitcase trying
to find outfits and at least for me
every time I'd go on vacation I would
just become so disorganized everything
was all over the place I couldn't find
stuff and it was just like a big hot
mess like it just didn't work out so in
this video I'm going to be telling you
guys a couple of my little tips and
tricks uh not to stay organized while
you're on vacation so yeah these tips
are mainly towards the people that are
staying somewhere for a long time but of
course you can still use these tips if
you're you know going on vacation for
like a couple nights okay so the first
tip is using the dressers and I don't
know some people might be kind of
grossed out by using hotel dressers but
I don't really care that much so I
usually like never I don't know why I
never used the dressers before but they
actually help a lot you know because
then you can kind of like organize they
like
have your bottoms and want like the tops
and stuff so I definitely recommend
doing that if you're doing for a long
time and if you feel really grossed out
using them you can just take like a
Kleenex wipe thing and just like wipe it
down and then put your clothes in it and
it helps a lot like we went at when we
went to Florida the first day we just
unpacked everything put in the dressers
and got everything organized and it was
perfect so definitely recommend using
the dressers I don't know why like I
never used them before but now from now
on I'm gonna start using them more often
the next tip that I have is if you guys
have any like material foldable cubes
like this one I got this from hot look
kind of a while ago cuz guys know that
it kind of takes a while for them to
like ship stuff so you can't buy this
anymore like the event obviously ended
but this is from the Macbeth collection
and hot luck was having like a sale on a
bunch of like organizational stuff and I
bought this one because my closet has
like a pink thing like pink theme going
on so yeah I don't know if I've actually
like ever talked about holic with you
guys I feel like I've never mentioned it
in a video but I'm obsessed with hot
look if you guys don't know or it's
actually pronounced hoot look but I like
saying hot look if you guys don't know
what that is it's just a website where
basically every single day they have
different events like sale events and
it's like from a bunch of different
companies sometimes they do makeup like
steal all the bomb and like Urban Decay
and stuff like that but then they also
do kind of like home decor and like this
kind of stuff and rust they do like
kitchen appliances they do fashion
purses shoes Julie they basically do
everything so yeah it's really awesome
things can be up to like was it like 70%
off I don't know the deals on there are
crazy I just checked that website every
single morning because they have like a
new sale event every single day and then
it lasts like a couple days and then
yeah so it's really really awesome check
it out I have the link in the downbar
for that website sorry talked about that
for a long time but that's where I got
this and this looks like it take up a
lot of room in your suitcase but it
really doesn't
has storage cubes like this usually have
a bottom that you can take out and then
it just sold like this so obviously it
doesn't take up a lot of room I just put
this in my suitcase this thing helped so
much you have no idea okay
so I put all my clothes like in the
dressers and stuff but I've never like I
used to never have a spot to put my bras
my underwear like my swimsuits my socks
all that stuff sports bras whatever
that's what I use this for it was
seriously the perfect thing because I
would just put on the ground and I would
just throw everything in here and just
kind of take it out and it was just it
was like it was such an easy way to keep
that stuff organized and it was just
amazing so definitely for now I'm gonna
be bringing this thing whenever I go on
vacation for a long time so if any of
you own things already and like use them
in your closets definitely take it with
you because it helps you so much like
you don't understand this is like a
lifesaver for sure so my next tip for
you guys is to bring some sort of bags
for example this one is just like kind
of like that recycle its feeling like
they're recycling bags and it's just
like looks like that I don't know and
then also I have these two from Urban
Outfitters they're like material and
yeah the reason why I like bringing like
random bags like this or I actually have
this other bag it was like mesh and is
like a drawstring bag so you can like
tighten it and where I like using these
for is to kind of keep your dirty
clothes away from your clean clothes you
know I'm saying so whenever you're done
like wearing a dirty pair of socks or
underwear or whatever I'll just throw it
into one of these bags and it'll kind of
keep me organized in a sense that like I
won't have everything mixed up between
dirty and clean so definitely recommend
that too because you can just throw
whatever you used in there and then once
you get home you can just take that bag
and go wash that stuff and yeah so that
helps a lot because before I'd always be
like mixed up and be like wait did I
wear these socks yesterday because I
have like a lot of
they're like the same and I don't know
stuff like that so I think bringing some
sort of like my bags or something works
really well also before I actually get
to the vacation spot or whatever like
while I'm packing I also like to use
these bags for putting my shoes in them
so you know cuz you your shoes are like
dirty on the bottom and stuff and I
don't like them touching my clothes so
I'll just put shoes in here and then
like one or two pairs in here and then
roll it up and put in my suitcase so
that's just another extra tip on how you
can use these like random bags like this
so I think that's also a great way to
kind of stay organized while you're in
your vacation spot
so my next tip is bring a lot of makeup
bags and stuff like this this really
helps with kind of keeping your
toiletries and makeup and hair products
and all that kind of stuff organized and
for example I just have this one from
Vera Bradley it's like a makeup case and
then another one from Dior and then also
I really like makeup or whatever you
want to call them bags that look like
this where basically they have a hook at
the top and then you can just kind of
reach first stuff this is great because
a lot of bathrooms and hotels have
somewhere where you can hook this on
whether it's on the door or where you
like fold the towels or stuff like that
and sometimes they actually have like
hooks so this is great because this
saves a lot of like counter space in the
bathroom so you can you know use that
space for something else so you could
just hang this up and then have like
your I don't know toothbrush toothpaste
just hanging in here so this is really
great um obviously it keeps everything
organized and just the fact that you can
hang it just makes life that much easier
so this I got from Lancome I think my
mom got it for free or maybe she got it
like with a kit or something like that I
don't know but yeah so you can get these
practically anywhere you could probably
get them at Target or Ultar stuff like
that so yeah so my next tip is how to
store your makeup brushes because I feel
like those can kind of get all over the
place if you do or if any
you own them like a makeup brush belts
which looks like this or if you have a
brush roll a lot of Sigma brushes come
with them and stuff like that definitely
recommend using them I guess that's kind
of an obvious one but it really does
keep your brushes you know organized and
stuff like that because once you use one
you put it back in here they're not like
all over the place plus I like keeping
them in here like better because I feel
like it kind of keeps the brushes
cleaner too because if you're just like
throwing them on the counter it's like I
don't know like sometimes I can be kind
of like gross stuff I'm just like
putting my brush on the bathroom counter
of a hotel so this is great because once
you're done that you can put it back in
here close it up and everything is like
more sanitary and stuff like that so
that's also I like using this but if you
do not own stuff like this then you can
easily buy I don't have one on me right
now but some kind of pencil case or you
can actually just use a pencil case and
just lay them in there and that's also a
nice way to store your makeup brushes so
my next tip is for dresses and things
that you don't want to like be wrinkled
and stuff so maybe more delicate things
that you don't want to stuff in a drawer
definitely recommend breaking hangers a
lot of times hotels actually have them
but I shared a hotel room with my cousin
my mom and her mom it was for girls and
obviously like five hangers it's not
enough for all of us so these are great
these are like the huggable hangers
where it's like fuzzy I don't know but I
like bringing these on vacation because
they're super thin as you can see so
they're not like those bulky plastic
ones that take up a lot of room in your
suitcase these are great because in my
suitcase I'm just able to kind of sit
them in at the side of my suitcase like
flat against the wall of the suitcase
and yeah these are great because
obviously they're good for traveling
because they're so small and in general
I just really like these so yeah that's
also great so that is actually it for
today's video I hope a couple of these
tips helped you guys on staying
organized while you're on vacation and I
tried to get give this up as soon as
possible so hopefully I didn't miss all
