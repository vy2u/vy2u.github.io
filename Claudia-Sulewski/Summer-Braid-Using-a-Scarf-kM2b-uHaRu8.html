a hair tutorial and I'm really excited
for this one because I think it's really
cute and it's definitely a really good
way to kind of spice up your outfit for
example if you're just wearing like a
black dress or something like that
and basically what it is is you take a
ribbon and you kind of turn it into a
headbands but then you also incorporate
it into a braid like one side of your
head I guess and it looks really really
cute you don't need any accessories for
it and I don't think that a lot of
people wear it like this I mean I know
where I live no one ever wears like that
so it's kind of like a new thing and
like I don't know everyone's gonna be
like oh my god how did you do that
but I do want to mention something I
have seen like I don't know how many
people but I know that I've seen bugs
beauty do one of these hair tutorials a
while ago she kind of did it a little
bit different than me so I just wanna
put that out there that I definitely did
not like come up with this all by myself
like I'm not going to take the credit
for everything because this tutorial is
kind of inspired by love and linking
it's out of a job market
she incorporates a ribbon in her braid
so it's like a little bit different but
I definitely do not want to take all
credit for all this so like yeah I'll
put her video in the downbar so you can
see it so if you like that one better
than you can do that too but I'm just
going to do one with a headband as well
so yeah I hope you guys enjoy this hair
tutorial
and let's get started right okay so
first let's start out by taking a comb
and I'm just gonna brush through my hair
of course you want to make sure your
hair is not naughty or anything like
that
okay so that's good now I'm going to
show you guys the things that you need
for today's video so first off you need
any type of like piece of fabric or
ribbon or scarf or anything like that I
chose this one because it's really
skinny but it's really really long as
well you want to make sure that it's
long so you want that also you want any
like thicker headband like this because
we're gonna be putting this underneath
the ribbon just because I feel like when
I use the ribbon as a headband it
doesn't really stay on it kind of like
slips off and it doesn't it's not like
tight enough to keep your hair back and
stuff like that so we're gonna be
putting a thick headband underneath and
I chose a white one because this one is
a little bit clearer and I feel like
when you put the white white underneath
the colors are kind of gonna be able to
stand out and look a little bit brighter
than they normally do on you know your
natural hair so you need those two and
then of course you need some kind of
hair tie and I'm just gonna be using a
regular one for the top part but then
when I want to what's it called close
the braid at the bottom or tighten it or
whatever I'm going to be using these
little clear elastics if you can do that
okay so first off you're gonna start out
by putting your hair in a bun just kind
of getting it out of your face
that
alright whatever it really doesn't
matter okay so now I'm going to grab one
of these thicker headbands and I'm going
to put it on okay so now you're going to
grab this little you know ribbon thing
that you have or the scarf or whatever
you're going to use and mine is pretty
thick as you can see so I'm going to
fold it in half just so that it's a
little bit thinner okay so now I'm going
to grab it I'm gonna place it right on
top of the headbands
now make sure you cover all of it so
once you have it centered know if you
can see this I'm just creating that
right here just to tighten it okay so
now what you're gonna do is you're going
to take the pieces and put them on the
side that you want the braid to be on
and I'm gonna be having on my left side
so just make sure it's tight put them
down and I can take your hair down from
this little bun so you're just gonna put
all of your hair into the same side and
then you want to grab any little hair
tie or anything like that and you just
want to tie your hair into a low
ponytail just so that all the pieces are
you know together and I'll just be
easier to work with so just like that so
now what you're gonna do is you're gonna
split the hair into two pieces because
we're gonna be making a four piece braid
but the way that we're gonna do it is
we're not going to be making into a
regular braid we're going to be weaving
it so you're just gonna split your hair
in half and you're gonna start out by
having its hair ribbon hair ribbon just
so that the braid turns out so we're
just gonna start out by kind of like
alternating you know from the hair to
the ribbon so first you're gonna start
out by weaving with the piece that is on
the outside and you're basically you're
just gonna go under over under so you're
going to take the piece of hair it go
under that piece over this piece
like that and then under this one and
that's all you do that's all you do the
entire time so now I'm going to grab
this piece on the outside and go under
over under
okay so now once it goes to the bottom
I'm just going to grab a clear elastic
and tie it off so that's how it should
look and you can actually keep it this
way if you want to but the weird thing
about this braid is in my opinion it
looks better on the other side because
you can see like it's like a line like
that and I really like this better than
how this looks so if you like the other
side better then all you have to do is
flip the baby break through so above
your hair tie in this little like chunk
of hair you're just gonna create a hole
just like that you're just gonna stick
it through and then just pull it through
so now you're gonna have this side
showing instead of the other one so
looks like that so now to make this look
a little bit more messy we're gonna pull
through some of the hairs in the front
because you don't want it to look too
perfect and tight like that so I'm just
going to grab my brush and just kind of
pull some pieces through
and you can also pull the headband back
and then push it forward so you have a
little bit of like a bump also if you
want you can try curling these pieces in
the front if you want but I'm just gonna
leave them natural so that's it for
today's tutorial I hope you guys enjoyed
it it's a great tutorial and hairstyle
to have during the summer just because
you know your hair is out of your face
and it looks really cute and it
definitely spices up an outfit so now I
would basically wear is maybe just a
bracelet that matches to this scarf and
I think it's really fun because if you
have a different a bunch of different
scarves and you can always spice it up
and choose different colors and patterns
and stuff like that so I really really
like this hairstyle I definitely think
that you know you'll prep and press your
friends a little bit and everyone's
gonna be asking you how you do this and
stuff like that so if you want to see a
look without the headband part like this
then go ahead and check out both beauty

i got like where i got this look
inspired from and basically that's it
