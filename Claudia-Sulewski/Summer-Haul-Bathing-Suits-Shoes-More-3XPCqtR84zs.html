still alive please don't kill me I
apologize for taking such a long break
on YouTube but but I just finished
school so I'm officially on summer break
and I'm happy that I did because I
really needed to focus on my grades and
studying for finals and stuff and I also
went to LA the weekend before finals so
I was just really stressed out and I'm
just really happy because I finished off
the year with the grades that I wanted
to get and yeah now YouTube is going to
be my main focus inside nothing else to
do this summer this is also kind of like
a collective haul because some of these
things I got a long long time ago but
I've just never shown in a video I'm
gonna start out by showing you guys what
bathing suits I recently got kicked out
I kind of went a little crazy one day I
was I was just really in the mood for
bathing suits
the first bathing suit that I got was
from PacSun and the top looks like this
so it's black and it has a really pretty
grey floral print on the boob area and
also I like the back because it has two
straps instead of one it kind of spices
up the bathing suit and then the bottoms
look like this so they have the same
pattern and then they've just got black
on the sides so I really really love
this bathing suit the next bathing suit
that I got is from two different stores
so I kind of mixed and matched the tops
and bottoms but I can't even explain how
excited I am to wear this so the bottoms
are from PacSun and they look like this
they are super cheeky so they show like
half of your butt but they are so cute
and they'll be good for tanning so the
sides have like little nuts on them and
then the top to go with these bottoms
it's from Victoria's Secret and it's
just their cups like strapless bathing
suits I love these and the back is
really cool it's like braided so it kind
of goes with the sides the colors are
just so fun and they're going to look
really great with a tan then I also got
another top from PacSun in the same
style as the first one but this one is
black and then it has like this striped
design to it it also has
two straps and I could not find the
bottoms to these so instead I bought
these bottoms from this random website
it's by the brand what I don't know how
to pronounce that that's the brand the
bottoms look like this if you guys
follow any of the Jenners on Instagram
then you might recognize these because
they wear them a lot but it looks like
this it has three little straps on the
sides and then the back looks like these
these are actually really really
expensive I think these were like $50 or
something I know it's a bit crazy but
since they are black they will match
with a lot and I just really like how
they fit as well so I'm very very happy
about these while I was in Victoria's
Secret I also got a black top just to
have so that I can wear it with whatever
bottoms I want to yeah so I got that and
then also when I was shopping in forever
21 I got these bottoms which are black
and you probably cannot tell but they
have like this lace like crochet texture
to them and I don't know they're just
super cute they're really cheeky as well
so they're great for tanning your bum
did I really just say that I just want
to have a tan bone okay guys so now onto
clothing I'm first going to show you
guys what I got from PacSun recently so
the first thing is this pair of shorts I
don't know why I bought them they just
they look really nice on and they'll be
good for working out or just lounging
around at my house and stuff I don't
know I don't have a lot of like running
shorts so I needed those also I got this
top right here it's kind of like a
cropped bustier type of style shirt but
it looks like this it's so adorable it's
navy blue pink and white obviously it's
floral and the way that you put this on
it's really weird you have to undo it in
the front and then you put it on it's
really cute and I really really like it
back son is also starting to sell brandy
melville so of course I had to get a
shirt while I was there and it looks
like this it's just a black muscle tee
and it says Los Angeles and New York on
it and I feel like everyone has this so
I decided to buy for myself lastly I got
a pair of wedges and actually wore these
while I was in LA for Generation beauty
and they're just very simple I didn't
really have any brown wedges that's you
know can really go with anything so I
decided to pick these up they're just
simple they've got a strap in the front
and at the bottom and yeah I don't know
I think they'll go with a lot so I'm
happy about these since we're on the
topic of shoes I want to show you guys a
pair of heels that I recently got from
Windsor can we just take a moment to
look at these I could honestly say these
are the most beautiful shoes I've ever
owned
they are just absurd just gorgeous you
should go buy them I'm just gonna place
these behind me so that you guys can
stare at them next up I've got one thing
from Kitson and when I was at LAX with
Lauren as we're waiting for our flight
home we found a Kitson at the airport so
of course we had to stop by and I
decided to finally pick up one of my own
homies shirts so it's gray and white it
was super overpriced but I don't even
care I wanted to get it so I got it next
up I've got two things from Topshop and
these are actually kind of old but I've
never shown them in a video so first off
are these leather high-waisted shorts
I've never owned leather high-waisted
shorts before so I was really happy when
I saw these I feel like this is more
like fall and winter but then I also got
this little white cropped tank thing I
don't know this looks very very cute
with high-waisted skirts and shorts and
it's just one of those basic essentials
that everyone kind of needs for the
summertime next up I've got a few things
from American Apparel my first item are
these shorts right here and can we just
talk about how crazy and colorful these
are when I saw these in the store I knew
that I immediately had to get them
they're really not my style
like at all um but they look so cute I
love them especially with that white
cropped top from Topshop it just looks
so adorable with like white converse and
stuff so I think they're so fun
especially for the summertime because
you know they're so bright and they're
like super super high-waisted yeah I got
those and then also you guys know how
obsessed I am with my Miley shirt the
shirt that my Lee owns it's like white
and it has like a pocket so I decided to
get that shirt in two different colors
because I was wearing the white one way
too often so the first one is this cream
shirt with gray stripes and very basic
just looks like that and that also I got
the same shirt in this minty like
tiffany blue color it's like a teal next
up I've got a clutch from forever 21 and
it looks like this it's black faux
leather and then it has these really
pretty gold starting on it that goes on
the front and the back and it's just
like an envelope style clutch I don't
really own very many clutches so I was
kind of out on the lookout for them that
didn't make sense I thought this would
be really cute for whenever I'm gonna go
out or go out to dinner or something
like that
so I'm very very happy about this so
I've only got one more clothing item to
show you guys and it is actually from
Charlotte Russe which normally I don't
shop there but this was actually really
really cute so I decided to buy it
it's a cream-colored maxi skirt that
goes kind of transparent on the bottom
with like this really pretty lacy
material and then of course it has like
a little short skirt underneath and this
is actually a really big trend right now
and I thought this would just look
really really cute with like a cropped
white fitted tee and some Brown sandals
so yeah I was very very excited when I
saw this skirt because I've always
wanted one of these but I could never
like find them anywhere so I'm going to
end off today's video here because I can
already tell it's going to be super long
so I hope you guys enjoyed it make sure

generation Beauty I'll have that linked
down below

very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
