showing you guys my summer haul which is
basically a bunch of clothes that I
bought for the summertime so I guess
it's kind of like a pre summer haul um
and also I'm going to be including a
couple of other random things because I
went shopping today so I decided that
I'm just going to add those in as well
so it's kind of like a collective haul
but also I apologize if you guys can
hear my fan I have a fan sitting on the
ground that's flowing on me because it
is so hot in my room and so hot in my
house I am like sweating so I apologize
if you guys can hear that hopefully the
camera won't pick it up too much my
latest obsession has been shorts I have
been buying it shorts like a crazy
person
ok lately I've been so impressed with
forever21 shorts they have been coming
out with so many unique and actually
really good quality like shorts so I do
warn you guys I have a lot of shorts to
show you guys I've been buying them like
crazy but everything I bought in this
video was with my own money my parents
didn't buy for any of it so this is what
I like to spend my money with clothes ok
I know I'm a Shopaholic but it's ok
because I love all this stuff so I'm
like so excited to show you guys I don't
know okay so first pair it looks like
this they are so fun and crazy and by
the way all the shorts that I'm going to
be showing you guys are all from forever
21 so I bought these today they're just
tire with white and like a bright blue
color oh my gosh these are so cute I'm
so excited to wear them um the next pair
is a little bit different they look like
this they're super flowy umm these are
kind of worn kind of high-waisted but
not really that high kind of in-between
I just like how they're so flowy so they
will be great for the hot weather this
summer the next pair is very very crazy
they look like this but I love them so
they're just white and black and they're
this crazy tribal print going all the
way around obviously you have to wear
something very simple with them like a
white or black shirt or even a collared
shirt but I just
these were so much fun and so cute so
yeah I got these today as well
the next pair I kind of got a few weeks
ago I got these online they look like
this they're just this light kind of
distressed Jean and they look like that
they're super high waisted and I've been
loving high-waisted shorts lately
because I didn't really own that many
before but I've been buying them like
crazy so I love this pair the next
parent looks like this I also got these
online so they're just like acid-washed
Jane denim and whatever and then they're
distressed and then also they have this
awesome like silver stud detailing on
the pocket and they just look like that
and these are also high-waisted I love
these and also excuse my nails I was
playing with this like nail polish
marker thing I don't know so
yeah they look kind of weird but anyway
so I have those and then also these I
got these yesterday in the mail so you
could probably still order them online
and they look like this so they just
have that faded dark to light kind of
ombre look and these are really unique
then the last pair are these right here
I got them like a week ago and they're
like a neon kind of teal ish color
they're a little bit distressed in some
places and they're kind of washed out as
well like faded those are all the shorts
I think I'm pretty much good for the
entire summer because I have a lot of
shorts now so next up are bathing suits
so first I'm going to start out with
what I got at air Postel because
sometimes their bathing suits are really
cute so for example this one I love this
one so here's the top to it it's just
like a sunset kind of Beach theme going
on so there's the top and then here is
the bottom this is the back they look so
good I love this baby suit so much and
they also had this sales section in the
back and I got these plain black bottoms
and they were like four or three dollars
I don't know it was so crazy and I had
to buy them because I need to get a new
pair of black bottoms because I wear
black bottoms all the time
and then also today I got three bathing
suit tops from Victoria's Secret I
didn't buy any of the matching bottoms
because Victoria seeker is really
expensive and the top is kind of the
most important part in my opinion I
could always just match these with like
a black bottom so the first one looks
like this it's like a bandeau style so
it's white and it has this like leopard
detailing on it it's rainbow and it's so
cute it also comes in the strap and oh
my gosh I love this so much so the next
top looks like this it has kind of more
of that bra look to it but it's so cute
it's like this coral color and then it
has pink like detailing and it has a
really cute like teardrop cutout at the
top and then it has a little bone
between and this will look so good with
a tan so I got that and then the last
top that I got from Victoria's Secret
was this one right here it has like that
halter kind of style to it but it's
rainbow oh my gosh this is my favorite
one I love them I don't know why but I
love the way that this one looks on me
and yeah it looks like that I got all
these from Victoria's Secret not pink so
just in case cuz both of them likes love
in suits but in my opinion the Victoria
Secret ones are way better and then
that's all for bathing suits so now for
tops I didn't really get that much but
today I just got a nude cami it's like a
v-neck cami from forever 21 and then
also I bought three shirts from PacSun
calm the first one looks like this it's
just a mint green color and it has a
cross with black roses on it and sweet
PDX has this shirt and every time she
wears that I always like think to myself
that it's so cute I always want to get
it so I finally got it it looks like
that and then also the next shirt looks
like this I wore it I think in my latest
video it has a crazy like pattern to it
it's all rainbow it's mainly like
blueish I guess and the back is really
cute because it has like a little slit
so looks like that and
the last shirt that I'm going to be
showing you guys looks like this this is
also from PacSun it's kind of cropped so
I would wear this with high-waisted
shorts and it's just really cute bright
yellow color so I thought that would
look so cute for the summer and with a
tan and yeah then also I recently got
this a jean jacket and this is great for
kind of those cooler nights when it gets
cold like later in the day and you just
need something to throw on so it's kind
of hard to show you guys how it looks
but it's not really your ordinary jean
jacket it's kind of a little bit more
unique so it looks like this I can't
even show you guys it has ties at the
bottom so you can tie it it has buttons
and more strings and it's kind of hard
to see but yeah it has like quarter
length sleeves it looked really ugly on
the hanger but I was like hey I want to
try it on because it kind of looks
interesting and when you put it on it
looks so pretty and I'm just in love
with it oh my gosh so next up our
sunglasses and I bought both of these
from forever 21 I've been really
impressed with their sunglasses lately
so the first pair it looks like this it
kind of has a really unique shape to it
it's kind of boxy in a way because it's
like flat at the bottom I don't know it
kind of reminds me of like squares but I
thought it looked interesting
it's not really your average like
sunglasses shape I thought it looked
pretty cool so I got those the next pair
looks like this I also think that these
are kind of different and unique just
like the other ones so they kind of have
that cat eye shape to them at the top
but it's not too dramatic and then also
they have like animal spots on the sides
and on the top and then it just fades to
normal at the bottom and these look like
this yeah I think they're really cute
and different so that's why I bought
them and also today I just stopped by
Mac to pick up another mineralized
skinfinish natural because I ran out of
mine
and I am obsessed with this stuff I love
this this is my everyday powder and I am
in this shade medium plus so looks like
this I'm so excited I took go like two
or three weeks without this because I
just never ended up buying it I finally
repurchased another one so I am so
excited to start using this again so
that concludes my haul I hope you guys
enjoyed it and hopefully it wasn't too
long I don't know we'll see what happens
when I edit but that is it for today's
video I hope you guys enjoyed it and
yeah okay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
