today's video is going to be kind of
like a summer inspiration type video so
I will be showing you guys different
DIYs and tutorials to help you get into
the summer mood so we're going to be
covering a few different topics the
first air Y that I'll be showing you
guys is how to make my favorite
breakfast at the moment and it is a
smoothie Bowl they are super fresh and
delicious and colorful so it's perfect
for the summertime and I highly
recommend that you guys make this so
let's see how to make a symbol to start
off I'm going to put in a handful of
spinach one banana a packet of frozen
dragon fruits and lastly some frozen
tropical fruits and using my Vitamix I'm
just mashing that all together now I
love to put on a bunch of toppings
because it makes it super crunchy so I
like to keep the toppings fairly healthy
as you can see I put a lot on and then
on top I usually put whatever fruit I
have in my kitchen
so the second tutorial I'll be showing
you guys is how to create the makeup
that is actually on my face right now it
is perfect for this time of year because
it's super light and colorful it's not
too dark or cakey so you're not going to
be like sweating black all over your
face now that it's summer I've been
having a lot of fun experimenting with
different colors on my eyelids so let's
go see how I created this look for
today's look the main products I'm going
to be using is buxom eyeshadow bar which
is basically a palette where you can
customize what you want inside out of 40
different eyeshadows but if you're not
up for the challenge then that is
totally fine because they also have
pre-made palettes so today I'm going to
be using pastel persuasion for my lid I
will be using the green and blue
eyeshadow and right away you will notice
how pigmented they are and that's
because their primer infused so you
don't need a primer which is awesome now
using the taupe eyeshadow I'm applying
that into the crease to darken up my
look
I'm also applying on that same color to
my lower lashline to balance out the
look and smoke it out a little bit now
for mascara I'm just using my they're
real mascara and applying it to my upper
and lower lashes to lighten up my lips
I'm using my NYX butter lipstick and
just dabbing that onto my lips
my next DIY splash tutorial is actually
right behind me right over here so I'm
gonna be showing you guys have to create
this at home
sunglasses holder which of course is
perfect for the summertime because
everyone wears sunglasses and it's
really cute and easy and simple so let's
go see how I created this to start off
you're going to need some sort of frame
I decided to go with the white one and
the one that I'm going to paint which is
my next supply
you also need brushes obviously some hot
glue some decorative wire and some
material to cover the wire with you can
really use anything old clothes that's
what I did obviously I had to create a
white one for my bedroom because
everything is white but I'm going to
show you guys how to create the other
one so start off by grabbing any
material and just cutting out four
strips they do not have to be perfect
now I am taking the wire and measuring
it from the back of the frame to make
sure that it fits into that little
groove and once I do that it is time to
paint the frame and I decided to go with
this really pretty pastel teal color so
I'm just applying on about three coats
to make it an opaque color and while
that's drying we're going to start hot
gluing the material on to the wire so
all you have to do is just glue it at
the tip and start wrapping it around
once you get to the end just glue it off
to seal it and chop off the excess
material so you're just going to do that
to all of the wires and eventually once
your frame dries then go ahead and hot
glue the wire into the frame I decided
to do four because I thought it looked
pretty and that is all you have to do
now you are done with your frame you can
hang it up and put some sunglasses on it
you can totally also put jewelry on it
or whatever you want so definitely get
creative so lastly I'm going to show you
guys how to create your own DIY this
looks very complicated body chain
necklace don't be intimidated yet
there's actually three of them tangled
in here because I was having so much fun
making them and they turned out so cute
and fancy looking so I actually made
three this super cute for the summertime
because you can wear them over cup tops
and cute little summer outfits so let's
go see how I made these
so you're going to start off by cutting
some chain you will need two pieces that
are 23 inches long and to it that are 12
inches long so starting off with these
shorter ones you're going to want to
loop them with the center ring so I'm
using these like medium sized rings to
join them together so which looks
something like that and then for the
longer pieces we're going to put some
sort of little pendant or jewelry piece
in between to make it look cute
so I'm just using the same process to
connect all of them to the middle ring
now once you've done that you will need
a lobster claws to put on to both sides
so that you can obviously connect them
together like a necklace so I'm just
using one of the chains that I broke off
to clamp together with the little clip
and once you do that to the other side
you are completely done with your body
chain I made three different kinds and
they're perfect for the summertime so I
have a starfish a Sun and a cute little
green gem so I am completely obsessed
with how they came out and I really hope
that you guys try this out as well so
