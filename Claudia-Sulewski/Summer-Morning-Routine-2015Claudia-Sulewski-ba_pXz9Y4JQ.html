hey guys so today's video is going to be
my summer morning routine so I'll be
showing you guys what I do from when I
wake up to when I leave the house so I
normally naturally wake up at around 9
a.m. and the first thing I'll do is just
check social media websites so if you
guys want to follow me on Twitter or
Instagram
it's just Claudius loose key I'll have
it linked in the description box but
once I'm done looking over those I'll
kind of sit up and decide whether I want
to get out of bed yet
start my day and today I decided yeah
yeah it's time to get out of bed so I
love putting on these little flip-flop
slippers I wear them everywhere they're
like tempur-pedic so I throw those on
and quickly make my bed then I head on
over to the bathroom
so now I'm just doing the normal stuff
brushing my teeth with some toothpaste
and toothbrush and after that I like to
wash my hands and wash my face with my
Burt's Bees daily cleanser I'm really
obsessed with it so once I do that I
decided that I want to take a body
shower well I usually do it every
morning but I wash my hair the previous
day so I just threw my hair in a bun to
not get it wet and I took a quick shower
so here are the products that I normally
use when I'm in the shower if you guys
are curious yes I did bring a GoPro into
the shower I did do that it was really
exhilarating I what am I saying
and I just jumped back into my
loungewear because I'm not ready to
choose my outfit yet so normally I'll
walk down into the kitchen and I'll make
myself some breakfast I kid you not guys
every single day
make a smoothie bowl I am obsessed with
them it's basically like a smoothie
without any liquid so it's more of like
an ice cream and I'll just throw it all
into a big bowl and put on a bunch of
toppings if you guys want a recipe I
will have it linked in the downbar I
made a video on it but alongside that I
make myself some hot green tea and can
we talk about this like hot water faucet
thing it's incredible it gives you hot
water right away I don't know I was
amazed when I first discovered it but
usually what I like to do is grab my tea
and my breakfast and bring it out to my
balcony rather than sitting on my phone
or listening to music I am obsessed with
listening to audiobooks while I eat my
breakfast my favorite website to use is
audible.com because they've got over a
hundred and eighty thousand audio
programs so you are bound to find
something that you like on there I
personally love how they have an app so
I can easily listen to it on my iPad
which is what I'm doing today right now
I'm listening to Paper Towns because I
saw the movie so I wanted to listen to
the book it's amazing I highly recommend
it if you guys want to try it out you
can actually go to audible.com slash
Claudia to get a free book and a free
30-day trial I seriously recommend you
guys trying it out because it kind of
changes your life you could literally
listen to books whenever you want so
once I'm finished with my breakfast I
head back inside and I'll normally kind
of plan out my day see if there are you
know anything's going on socially or if
I have anything to film or places to go
so I'll usually just write out a to-do
list for myself if I'm required to leave
the house and socialize and interact
with people in the real world then I
will get ready in my bathroom and I've
actually got this really sin oh my gosh
someone's door that was rude
so I've got this really snazzy setup
over here with my mirror
and this light I really regret not
closing my door while filming this audio
so I'm continuing to listen to Paper
Towns while I get ready because for some
reason I feel really productive
listening to a book while I get ready
maybe that's just me but after that I
just pulled together my outfit and head
out the door hey guys welcome back to my
channel so I am so excited about today's
video because you guys request it so
often</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
