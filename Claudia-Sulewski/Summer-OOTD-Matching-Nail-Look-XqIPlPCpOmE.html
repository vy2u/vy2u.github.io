guys how to create this super fun and
colorful yet very very easy and nail
tutorial that is perfect for this time
of year and then of course at the end of
the video I'm going to show you guys an
outfit that I think perfectly matches
with the nails also I decided to change
it up a little bit and show you guys two
different versions of the nail tutorial
so if you happen to be watching this
video with your best friend right now or
your cousin or your mom my mom's my best
friend then this video is perfect for
you guys because you can create two now
looks that match each other so let's get
into the nail tutorial first off you're
going to have to put some sort of base
color all over your nails for this look
I'm going to be using the Sally Hansen
triple shine polish in the shade dive in
which is a super bright blue e turquoise
color and it just screams summer to me
so I had to use it so what I'm going to
do is grab his polish and apply it all
over my nails this nail polish is
already super pigmented on its own so it
usually takes about one to two coats to
get an even layer but i really like
these polishes because they are
resistant to salt water chlorinated
water and tap water so they will stay
shiny for however long you wear them so
next up we have to create the nail
design which i may add in is super super
easy but it's also very cute and unique
so to create my design i'll be using the
sally hansen at color foil in the shade
sterling silver which is super shiny and
literally looks like foil hence color
foil so to create the hearts nail design
i'm going to start off by drawing an
l-shape hugging at the top edges of my
nail then I'm going to go in and start
drawing in the rest of the heart while
filling it at the same time so it
definitely takes a little bit of
practice to get the heart shaped down
perfectly but I find that that is the
easiest method to do and to make things
a little bit easier I used one of the
tools from my Sally Hansen I heart nail
art tool kit the kit comes with little
brushes and dotting tools and stuff so
it's perfect for any nail art design
that you
create which by the way Sally Hansen is
currently hosting an awesome contest
right now as always I will have all of
the info in the description box but you
can enter for a chance to win five
hundred dollars and a trip to go to New
York and competes with a grand prize of
two thousand dollars and becoming a
sally hansen nail art sweetheart which
is kind of like there now ambassador but
i'll have all that down there because
it's a really awesome contest and i kind
of want to enter myself in that allowed
once you're done filling in our metallic
hearts i'm going to split it in half to
add a little bit more detail and kind of
edge it up a little so I'm gonna grab
one of these smaller brushes from the
kits and dip it back into my dive in
polish and literally just draw a line
through the heart super simple and easy
but it just gives that extra kind of mmm
to it I guess that's what people say so
once you're done with that step just go
on with any top coat I used the big
shiny top coat to seal everything in and
polish up the entire look so to create
the other now look I took the exact
opposite from silver and used gold this
is the color foil in the shade liquid
gold literally looks like liquid gold in
case you guys are wondering and I use
this for the metallic art which is kind
of perfect because if let's say you are
more of a silver jewelry type of gal and
your best friend aware is more gold
jewelry then it's perfect or vice versa
I tend to wear more silver so that is
why I created the silver look on my
nails but for the base coat I decided to
switch it up and do the exact opposite
of turquoise which is a cooler color and
go in with a pink nail polish and this
is the Sally Hansen triple shine in reef
wrap which is like a hot pink so it is
basically the same now look but kind of
the opposite with the colors the way
they come together
so now that we've got the now tutorial
down let's get into the outfits that I
decided to pair with it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
