at the Summer Sun tag which is basically
a tag where you just talk about your
favorite summer products and i was
tagged by AK doll here on youtube so
thanks Kayla for tagging me and that's
all I have to say so I'm just going to
get right into it the first topic is
your favorite summer hair product it
would for sure have to be the Aussie
three minute miracle deep conditioner I
am in love with this product it the
smell is literally summer in a bottle
like it's fruity and tropically and if
that's even a word and it smells exactly
like coconuts I love it so much it just
reminds me of summer every single time I
use this and I use this as my
conditioner so I use it every other day
and it just leaves my hair very soft and
shiny looking and it just helps hydrate
my hair so i would definitely recommend
this if you have never tried it out the
next topic is favorite summer body
product and might not have to be the
Burt's Bees a low and linen flower after
sun soother it looks like this i bought
this right before spring break and this
up this stuff saved my skin because it's
basically like a low and lotion put
together into one product so if your
skin is burnt anywhere you just put this
on before you go to bed or once you're
done being out in the sun and this stuff
is great i love it so much it smells
very calming um it just smells kind of
like ello um I don't really know but
yeah I also really like this because it
um hydrates your skin a lot but it also
soaks in really fast you guys know how
much I hate that kind of sticky lotion
feeling when you put on lotion and it
doesn't soak in right away but this
stuff soaks in really fast and that
feeling goes away really fast so that's
why I love this stuff as well and I know
that I'm for sure going to be using this
a lot this summer because I burned
pretty easily on my shoulders and on my
face and stuff so this is going to be
really nice for that the next question
is your favorite summer skin care
products and it's actually not burt's
bees
might be surprising because you guys
know how much I love it the company but
the product that i have here for you
guys today is the new clean and clear
morning burst fruit infusions purifying
cleanser i decided that i want to change
it up because i've been using birds bees
for so long and i'm still using most of
them i'm still using the acne solutions
one for nighttime but i did switch it up
for my morning routine and this stuff
smells so amazing once again it smells
just like summer it smells like orange e
but fruity and it's like orange and it's
just a really nice like refreshing just
splash on your face so i like using this
in the morning and it also has
strawberry seeds in it so it gives a
light and gentle-like exfoliation kind
of um and yeah it's used as real fruits
and I've just been loving this so much
plus the bottle is just so happy and
like cheerful-looking just you know like
gets you in the summer mood so um yeah
this is my favorite summer here not hair
face skin care products the next topic
is your favorite summer face product and
mine would have to be my daily
moisturizer that I use and this is the
Burt's Bees natural skin solutions
sensitive daily moisturizing cream I
cannot express my love for this lotion
this lotion is so like um it's not thick
it's not like it doesn't like it soaks
into your skin very quickly I know that
I talked about that in my skin care
video on how much it like soaks into
your skin like really quickly just like
this product too and yeah I just love
the pump it's so convenient and I use it
every single day
I just I literally just love this like
if you're looking for a new facial
moisturizer get this by this okay I you
are not gonna regret it it is amazing
the next topic is your favorite summer
self-tanner it would for sure have to be
the sun laboratories self-tanner and
this is in dark i have loved this and
i've been using this for like a couple
years i think two years i don't know but
i never go back to anything else this is
for sure like the bells the best self
tanner that I've ever used it smells
like cherries it doesn't have that gross
smell it gives a really nice color it's
not orange at all and I'm like down to
here so I'm going to be repurchasing
another bottle of these of course I just
I love this it's just everything in this
video that I'm showing you guys I just
love but seriously like this is really
good the next topic is favorite summer
scent and this one I don't really have a
summer scent but I am going to be using
the DKNY be delicious perfume because I
love the smell of this it's very kind of
like tart with fruity and I don't know I
just thought it kind of fit into the
summer theme but I always switch off my
sense so I don't really have like a
specific Somerset but yeah I like this
month so I just kind of edit it into
this video the next one is your favorite
summer nail polish and I have three and
obviously they're all very bright and
colorful looking so the first one is the
ZOA nail polish that I got from the
glossy box that you guys saw in my
previous video and this is in the shade
Arizona and it's just so bright and fun
and I love this and then also i've been
really into just basic you know bright
pink colors i usually don't wear pink
but i'm liking pink a lot more now and
this is from SC it's in pansy
and it's just bright you're just average
medium toned pink it's not too light to
dark and the other one that i have is um
bye kleancolor it's a nail lacquer and
it's just this bright kind of green
color seafoam green I guess and this is
in the color bikini green I think that's
really cute name so it looks like that
the next product is your favorite summer
I product and might have to be the
covergirl LashBlast volume waterproof
mascara I love this mascara so much and
it's waterproof so it's perfect for the
summer time the next one is your
favorite summer clothing item and mine
would for sure have to be high waisted
shorts you guys know how much I've been
in love with how short high-waisted
shorts lately I've been buying them like
a crazy person but these are just from
forever 21 they're very simple but I've
been loving how's the jorts so much and
i'm just going to be rocking them all
summer so i had to put these in this
video and my camera is about to run out
of memory so i have to do this fast but
the last one is your favorite summer
accessory and mine would have to be
sunglasses I've been buying a lot from
forever 21 lately these are probably my
favorite they kind of look like the
ray-ban kind of look to them I don't
know I like these the most and oh my god
