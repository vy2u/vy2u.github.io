primer potion I'm going to choose a
bright orange eyeshadow and apply this
into my crease it is going to work as
our background color that we are going
to be blending everything else into then
using Urban Decay's eyeshadow and
diamond dog shoutout to last month glam
bag video I'm going to apply this all
over my lids and just blend it in with
the orange eyeshadow going in with a
warmer toned brown eyeshadow I'm going
to apply this into my crease and my
outer V to darken up the look and warm
it up a little bit I'm also applying
this onto my lower lash line going in
with a dark purple eyeshadow I'm going
to apply this right into my crease and
blend it out I think this color really
complements with all the other shadows
and it just gives a little bit more
depth
pulling out my chela ivory lace
highlighter pencil I'm going to use this
to brighten up my inner tear-duct as
well as my brow bone so I just apply it
on and rub it in with my fingers and
this is a multi-use product so you can
use this for dark circles blemishes your
eyes and it's also a great base for
primer for eyelashes I'm using my J cat
beauty if false eyelashes these are
available in 30 different styles so you
can use them for any occasion and we
also go and black glue which is really
good because it pops to camouflage with
your eyeliner so that's how it looks
when you put it on your cheeks I'm using
my NYX blush in the shade of mauve
Erin's NYX has a huge range of different
cream and powder blushes and they all
give really nice payoff so I apply this
to my cheeks I'm keeping my lips very
simple by using my star luxe lip pencil
in the shade bear and it kind of has
purple undertones to it so it definitely
complements my eye look and it's also
long-lasting and full coverage so we'll
be staying aren't all nights and it's
just very clean so I just applied it to
my lips it's summer so I'm going to have
some fun glitter by using my jcat Beauty
sparkling clean palette and I'm just
going to grab my finger and dab this
my cheekbones as well as my temples and
you can do this for any concerts or
parties that you have going on and
they're really nice because they're
super creamy and they also have really
nice bold payoff and as you can see here
I tried attempted to make a star not a
star a Sun on my arm
and it looks like a five-year-old did it
so I'm just embarrassing myself right
now but yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
