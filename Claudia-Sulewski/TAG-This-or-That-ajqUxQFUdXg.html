doing a tag video and to see this or
that tag and a lot of firsts have been
doing this tag lately so I decided that
I'm going to be doing it and also i was
tagged by i love jb XA 1 so thank you
for tagging me and I've got the
questions down here on my lap so I'm
going to looking down and also this tank
is pretty long so I'm just gonna get
right into it because I don't want this
video to be too long so starting off
with the first one blush or bronzer
definitely bronzer because I wear it a
lot more often that I do blush and also
if I really did not only blush I could
just use some pink eyeshadow and just
apply it onto my cheeks the next one is
lip gloss or lipstick probably lip gloss
because I don't really wear lipstick
that much and I find myself having lip
gloss on my lips a lot more and plus
they taste really good and they smell
good so that's a bonus eyeliner or
mascara probably mascara because I wear
it every single day and I do not wear
eyeliner everyday so definitely mascara
foundation or concealer but that's
pretty obvious one for me and that's
foundation because you can just use
foundation like cover up and cover up is
really thick so that would kind of stink
to put it all over your face so
definitely foundation neutral or color
eyeshadow definitely neutral because I
don't really look like putting color on
my eyelids because I still think that
I'm at that young age where it just
doesn't look too good when I wear bright
colors on my lid
I'll try to go more natural pressed or
loose eyeshadow is definitely pressed
because they are a lot less messy first
of all and second of all they're just
kind of easier to work with and loose I
shadows can just kind of bulk me because
they get like they fall onto your cheeks
and you get a bunch axis and it's kind
of messy so definitely press everything
definitely a lot so far so I'm going to
try not to say that we're any more
brushes or sponges obviously brushes
because I never really use sponges and I
hate the fact that when you use sponges
after a while you have to throw them out
because you can't really clean them
about brushes you can reuse them and
clean them so brushes so now on to the
nails category the first one is OPI or
China Glaze I like both a lot but i have
to say OPI probably because i have more
of it I don't really have that many
china glaze so probably OPI long or
short nails my nails I guess are pretty
long but they're not really long so I
probably stay long but not like too long
if that makes any sense so yeah I like
long nails acrylic or natural oh my god
elementary grades okay acrylic are
natural probably natural because I've
never used acrylic nails and I like mine
so I don't think I'm ever gonna need to
use those bright or dark I'm like fifty
percent on that one because during the
summer and spring I like using bright
colors and then doing the winter and
fall I like using dark colors flour or
no flour usually no flour because
sometimes on their flowers like when I
get manicures but other than that not
really so now on to the body section for
few perfume or body splash that one is
actually really hard because I useful
I'm like I'll spray my body or whatever
and then i'll put some perfume on my
wrists and my neck right here so i don't
know i guess perfume because it looks a
little bit more stronger and more
noticeable lotion or body butter
definitely lotion because body butter is
just like kind of to like oily feeling
for me body wash or soap definitely body
wash lush or other Beth company I'm not
really I mean from what I've used to
blush I really like but I'm not I don't
buy a lot of stuff from there so
probably other bath companies like birds
bees obsessed with that company if you
guys know me I've said that in a couple
videos because they're all natural and
they don't test on animals which is
really great so probably other Beth
company so now im sue the fashion side
my got this tag the first one is jeans
or sweatpants jeans for out of my house
and then into my house like let's say
more skinny jeans school or whatever
when i come right home I've changed into
sweatpants so once again I'm just 50-50
on that but I like wearing jeans like
out to places when I'm going out
somewhere with my friends and then how
long is this video so far ok I went to
sleep um but sweat pants when I'm at
home because they're really comfortable
long suit were short definitely short
sleeves because first of all I barely
own any long so use they kind of bother
me and I just like short sleeve shirts a
lot better dresses or skirts probably I
I don't know because i really love
dresses but i have a lot more skirts so
i guess i have to say skirt stripes or
plaid hello strikes on wearing striped
shirt so yeah stripes flip-flops or
sandals flip-flops or just random days
and then for dressy days
sandals sandals are a little bit more
dressier or whatever but I wear
flip-flops more often so I'd have to say
that one scarves are hats definitely
scars because I don't wear hats that
much studs or dangly earrings I barely
own any studs so i'd have to say dangly
earrings because i think they're really
pretty and they definitely like enhance
your look well not hands but makes you
look like i don't know what i was just
going to say i don't know all right well
dangly earrings necklaces or bracelets
my god this is hard I mean I like a
probably necklaces yeah heels or flats
definitely heels because i do not wear
flats ever I mean you know i'm at the
opposite definitely flats because i
never wear heels oh my god cowboy boots
or riding boots probably cowboy boots
because oh we're actually right here
because i love cowboy boots they're so
cute and these are my and they're
actually almost too small on me so i
have to get new ones but i really like
them jacket or hoodie hoodie I love them
they're so comfy and cozy and just
wearing them with like uggs and skinny
jeans is the perfect outfit for me for
over 21 or charlotte russe definitely
forever 21 I love that store ever commie
or hollister probably hollister because
i've used to shop at Abercrombie all the
time when I was um like a couple years
back 5th 6th grade stuff like that and
now I'm we're more Hollister sets with
Avenue or sex fifth or nordstrom
probably nordstrom because I go there
more often and
I really go to sex with that you for
hair curly or straight straight I never
really curl my hair because I don't
really have the time and my hair is
naturally straight bun or ponytail
probably ponytail bobby pins or
butterfly clips bobby pins because
they're less noticeable and I like that
a lot better hairspray or gel probably
hairspray unless it's like the kind that
makes your heart hair like really hard
and like crusty or whatever I'd rather
choose Jail so it has to be a good
quality hairspray long or short
definitely long I do not like I mean
Ellie's on me i don't really like myself
with short hair that's all I look I like
longer hair light or dark I'm kind of
like medium but I like dark hair a lot
like I think I'm going to darken my hair
when I'm older and get like a dark brown
um side swept bangs or full bangs do you
mean by full bangs like that because I
would not look in that but if I had to
choose when I choose side swept bangs
all right up or down definitely down and
now for the last category of this video
and blue this video isn't that long
actually okay so for the random section
of this video rain or shine definitely
shine because um I don't really like
rain mm-hmm well I mean I guess it's fun
when you want to get wet but when you
don't want to get what rain it's not my
best friend summer or winter probably
summer cuter outfits too warm outside
you get tan it's more fun for me full or
spraying definitely fall because I kind
of hate spring spring is like like I
don't hate it but it's like my least
favorite
season because at least fall like the
leaves are so pretty and like right now
it's fall and I'm looking at my window
and its really really pretty because
there's like orange and yellow leaves
and stuff like that and the next one is
chocolate or vanilla definitely
chocolate um I don't really like vanilla
that much so I have to say chocolate and
for the last two on east coast or west
coast west coast because I want to move
to California when I'm older so
definitely west coast and that is it for
today's video and that was it for the
tag and I absolutely have no battery at
all so that's perfect timing so I'll see
you guys later for another video
hopefully because I am so bad with
making videos nowadays I'm sorry about
that i miss you guys so much i want to
get back into the swing once i get a new
camera which I don't know when that will
be but probably the latest like
Christmas time or something but yeah
