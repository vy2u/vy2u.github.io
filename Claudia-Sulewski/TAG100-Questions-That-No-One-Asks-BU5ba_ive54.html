filming a tag video for you guys but I
didn't know what to do so I started
stocking my YouTube friends and looking
at their videos and I found me 100
questions no one asks tag and this is
totally popular like a year ago so I'm
kind of doing this delayed but that's
okay I don't even think anyone tagged me
to do this is that a surprise no but I'm
doing it anyways because it looks fun so
let's get started with the first
question which is do you sleep with your
closet doors open or closed closed I
don't really pay attention to that
I think closed you take the shampoo and
conditioner bottles from hotels if they
have like high-end shampoos I totally
would but usually I don't like it so I
don't do you sleep with your sheets
tucked in or out I'm always out I never
really tuck in my sheets if I tuck in my
sheets for you that means you're special
have you ever stolen a street sign
before no I feel like one of my friends
has but I personally have never do you
like to use post-it notes sometimes not
really though do you cut out coupons but
never use them I've never really been
into like coupons and stuff so no would
you rather be attacked by a big bear or
a swarm of bees the bear would probably
kill me so I would say bees then again
the bear sounds cooler so the bear
obviously do you have freckles I have
like beauty marks like on my arms and
stuff but I don't really have freckles
on my face sometimes I get them but they
usually go away do you always smile for
pictures like unless I'm really unhappy
and I don't want the photo to be taken I
normally smile in every photo what is
your biggest pet peeve when my mother
chews Lily I don't care about anyone
else honestly everyone else is fine
except for my mom and I feel so bad for
the poor woman because it's not her
fault but every single time I'm in the
room with her eating I literally have to
leave the room because it's gee I don't
know why it's not like she's obnoxious
when she eats but just I can't stand
when my mother eats
I'm sorry mom do you ever count your
steps when you walk actually sometimes I
do when I'm walking to and from school
because I want to see if I can get the
same number have you ever peed in the
woods yes have you ever pooped in the
woods no do you ever dance even when
there's no music playing not when I'm
alone but maybe if I'm with my friends
and I feel like dancing then yeah do you
chew your pens and pencils no I've never
been into that and I think it's really
gross sorry if you do it how many people
have you slept with this week six no
seven okay what size is your bed my bed
is a full what is your song of the week
um I don't know what it's called
I'll have it right here but it's kind of
old but I recently just rediscovered it
and it just it makes me happy when I
listen to it so it's that song is it
okay for guys to wear pink I think so I
don't have anything against it do you
still watch cartoons I don't really
watch TV that much anymore but if I do
watch cartoons then I'll watch like a
South Park Family Guy or Sponge Bob
and sometimes reruns of ed n eddy but
those are unlike the lucky days when
sometimes they play them what's your
least favorite movie I normally don't
hate movies but the only one I could
think of is the Fred movie that Fred
made with like Nickelodeon there's
something I don't know it was really
weird where would you bury a hidden
treasure if you had some probably in my
backyard what do you drink with dinner
my favorite drink to drink when I'm
eating is iced water with a little bit
of lemon that's my favorite what do you
dip a chicken nugget in normally I'll do
like ketchup or barbecue sauce but I
also really really like it and honey so
good you guys need to try if you haven't
what is your favorite food I was
actually thinking about this this
morning and I'm completely tied between
pizza and Chinese food so I don't know
which one but they're both really good
what movies could you watch over and
over and still love definitely Mean
Girls that's like a classic of course um
and I don't know I really love Avatar I
think that movie is amazing
and maybe like the Harry Potter movies
too I've always loved those last person
kissed I think the last person I kissed
was a youtuber oh wait no three days ago
but it was by surprise and I was like in
mid-sentence while this was happening
and I was like stop it
no ill you need to go away um it was
really creepy this is why I don't like
boys in my school cuz they just attack
your face pretty much were you ever a
boy slash Girl Scout no I was never I
always wanted to be one but I never was
would you ever strip or pose nude in a
magazine I don't think so no when was
the last time you wrote a letter to
someone on paper Oh God
I think the last letter I wrote to
someone was like in eighth grade and he
was like a letter to myself we're
supposed to get senior year or something
but before that I honestly couldn't tell
you can you change the oil on a car no
no definitely not ever gotten a speeding
ticket no I have not ever ran out of gas
um no I have it
I've always been super close like every
time I get in the car it's always on
zero because my mom always uses it up
until zero so that I have to go fill it
up and it's really annoying
so this is like an everyday like thing
but um no I have it favorite kind of
sandwich Jimmy John's so good best thing
to eat for breakfast
um waffles fools what is your usual
bedtime it used to be like 11:00 and
then towards the end of the school year
it'd be like one o'clock and now it's
like 1:00 or 2:00
it's kind of bad are you lazy I wouldn't
call myself lazy I'm a huge
procrastinator so I do wait to the last
minute on lots of things but I always
make sure that I get everything done
I have something like stuck in my throat
slash nose and it's really annoying when
you're a kid what did you dress up as
for Halloween many
different things princesses this one
time I was like a gangster and I wore
this really weird like mask with like
dreadlocks I don't even know the
Harajuku girl for one year a ladybug um

little girls it was like very short tutu

inappropriate I'm pretty sure I wore
like tights with it though so you know

don't know I just read that weird um I
think I don't wanna share it with you

okay with that

Spanish so I'm pretty good at Spanish do
you have any magazine subscriptions okay

like a magazine but for some reason I've
been getting seventeen magazines and
teen vogue magazines sent to my house

why because I've never signed up for it
and it says my name so I don't know but
I have all these magazines and I don't
even read magazines they're just piling

most part no but I can be who is better

found it they're really comfortable so
sometimes I wear them do our bathrobes I
used to but then my mom sold them all
what do you wear to bed um I usually
just wear like a baggy t-shirt and

realization that I just need to wear
shorts so I wear shorts to bed what was
