apologies for not posting on here for
like two weeks
but I didn't completely forget about you
guys because I actually uploaded two new
vlogs on to my second channel which is
beyond beauty star TV
rest in peace be on be a star but I will
have both of them linked to right over
here so I actually lost while I was in
London for beautycon London is my first
time going there so that was really
exciting and I also uploaded a vlog from
my recent Bahama trip that I went with a
bunch of other youtubers so you can
click over here if you guys want to see
that I swam with sharks and reignited
with the bunch of youtubers and it was
just really great time so you guys don't
check out this box I will have them on
the screen as well as in the downbar of
course but today's video is a Q&amp;amp;A so I
tended you guys asking for you to send
me questions with the hashtag ask
Claudia with your weirdest most invading
questions effort and you have sent some
pretty good ones rachel asks what's your
favorite tampon brand honestly I
actually do have a favorite tampon brand
it is the really colorful packaging I
believe those you on it why am i
pretending like I totally did not pull
one out for you guys this is what it
looks like they're mini and you pull
them apart so that they get to their
real size and then use it and you're
done and it's awesome because it's so
portable and it's cute and it's colorful
and if you're a stick of butter what is
the first inanimate object you would rub
against I would definitely rub myself
against a cold hard shiny white marble
surface top because it's so cute and so
trendy at the moment as well yeah how
does this make you feel where the hell
is your boyfriend tag with Jonah Green
that is the video that I recently filmed
and that is also the video that had
issues with the footage so that will
need to be
apologies for the inconvenience but it's
coming
who is your actor crush let's see how
often would you say we stopped Blake
Lively on Google Images like once a
month maybe once it's a routine what is
your favorite emoji this one right here
it's so freaking cute and I'm so bad at
summertime because I will have more
excuses to use it are you going to
VidCon yes I am and I might possibly
also have em you know I'm not really
sure yet but I will be going of course
because becomes so much fun and I'm so
excited to meet you that's gonna be
boobs or butts you know I will say I do
appreciate a nice breast but I think I'd
have to say I'm a Buckeye
if you could choose to change your hair
color to a funky color for a day what
color would you choose well figuring
I've already done purple hair I would
have said purple but since I've already
done that I think would be so cool to
bleach my entire head and diet like a
teal like a pastel teal color oh so
pretty
would you hire someone to pick your nose
for you I thought long and deeply about
this question and I'd have to say no
because I've realized that I actually
really enjoy picking my nose it's really
fun that might be TMI but picking my
nose is really funny and yeah what is
the weirdest thing you have ever done in
front of Jonah and don't lie I asked
Jonah today what is the weirdest thing
I've done in front of him and you know
I've done a lot of weird things in front
of him so I can't really think of like
the number one top weird thing but one
of the first things that I remember
doing in front of him is Batman lives at
home one of our neighbors cats was
really annoying because at like 4 a.m.
every single night he make the weirdest
noise right outside of my bedroom
and my brothers like bedroom window I
kid you not it sounded like some weird
dying baby slash old lady shriek I don't
know it's really creepy but I used to do
it to Jonah
all the time like right straight up in
his ear and you hate it if you guys want
to hear it I'll do it for you right now
this is gonna be really embarrassing but
I'm just gonna do it and let you
practice I'm done so well I kid you not
every single night how to deal with
period pains actually I'm gonna bring
something over real quick I barely ever
used like any type of pills or you know
advil or anything like that just because
I don't really like taking medication a
lot but I swear by thermacare this one
specifically is for joint pain which
really has nothing to do with periods
but anyways it basically like giant
stickers that have these little things
on them that heat up I know that I could
buy like a heating pad like an electric
one I have yet to invest in one of those
because my parents really didn't start
hurting until like this year I would say
thank freaking change your life you just
clip it onto your stomach and it's
really hot and warm and fuzzy and you
feel like someone's like rubbing your
stomach and it's just so great and
comforting and definitely recommend
getting thermacare pads the next
question asks what movie deserves a
sequel I would say that Austin Powers
deserves another sequel I know that
there are three movies already I
remember growing up watching those
movies and being obsessed with them and
I know that the actors are a lot older
now so it would be a lot different and
they probably have to recasting it just
wouldn't be as good as the original ones
but if somehow we could go back into
time and have them film fourth
can you sing your favorite Hannah
Montana song to mouthful of marshmallows
I dare you to do it I don't have
marshmallows but I do have the next
thing which is crispy crunchy jackfruit
chips and I'm going to sing rock star by
Hannah Montana it's my favorite song
better
Oh
ah there's saliva everywhere that
