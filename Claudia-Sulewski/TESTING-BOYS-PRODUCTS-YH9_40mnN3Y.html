channel I have been making lifestyle
videos for over 6 years now and I feel
like this video just needed to happen a
little curiosity never killed anyone who
knows maybe I'll end up loving some of
these things probably not but so I'm
thinking we start off with Down Under
and try out some men's boxers premium
original fit I'm excited to see the
colours we've got a nice blue green blue
white and green Oh a nice ocean blue and
a classic red Wow I'm overwhelmed
they're kind of see-through little
scandalous here we go
kind of cofee not bad not bad at all
next up we're gonna do some shaving so
for the shaving cream we've got some
edge extra moisturizing cream on top
it's tough because purple is my favorite
color for the razors we have Gillette's
disposable larvae this that yes look at
it for the sake of great lighting we're
gonna do this in my room here's my
lovely assistant it's a bowl of water
smell test
ok this smell is exactly like Windex
yeah I used way too much okay Wow very
smooth is this weird as a viewer to be
watching this right now like I'm just
like shaving my leg in front of you guys
I will admit I'm keeping the razors
after you shave you obviously have to
put some aftershave on all I think about
is that one scene from home alone where
the kid puts on his face needles ah no
it's dripping everywhere ooh
okay yeah yeah yeah yeah that burns
leaves your skin feel
fresh and invigorated invigorated yes
agreed let's see what else we have in
here we've got some deodorants Old Spice
bear glove deodorant for a commanding
man this definitely looked like the
manliest deodorants I could find I mean
look at those bears on there it's the
fresh confidence scent that demands
respect and then eats it Wow
that can be taken very sexually whoo
wait a second I am pleasantly surprised
five stars for the color - let's try it
out shall we
this is more awkward than shaving my
legs in front of the camera very smooth
I was expecting you to smell really like
obnoxious and super manly but it's kind
of a blend of like a women's and men's
scent for our scent of the evening I got
some axe and this is dark temptation Oh
that technology when you twist it the
button pops up that is cool I'm scared
I mean smells like man
isn't it like shhh or something right no
maybe it's a X oh okay I'm gonna rape
this out of ten it was a little more
subtle I would give it like a seven I
just feel like I've smelled better I
don't want to put this on my hair why
did I buy this okay so we have ax spiked
up look putty
they had different types of hair gels
and stuff but spike okay didn't think it
was gonna be that goopy um Wow wait oh
my gosh this smells like something this
smells like the flax master smoothie I
had this morning is that that's not
right okay yeah this literally smells
like a smoothie here's my dilemma
I don't have guys hair my hair is very
long I don't know where to go about
putting this we're gonna scrunch in oh
no oh can you tell how miserable I am
right now I need to really experience
the full effect
oh I just cringed um yeah it really does
smell like my smoothie it's tripping me
up I give us like a three out of ten no
I give it like a 2 out of 10 the
transformation is almost complete last
but not least we need to work on this
outfit I don't know what I'm doing when
it comes to dressing like dude so we're
gonna go get some help from one of my
roommates
okay this food hack is mind-blowing
so if you're wanting to cut a mango
start off by cutting it long ways and
rather than trying to peel off the skin
just use any type of cup or glass and
you can easily slide out the mango and
then slice it up next time you're
cooking an overeasy I could try to crack
it inside of an onion ring it keeps it
from dripping all over the place and
accidentally breaking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
