everyone so today I'm doing it via
stripped-down challenge and if you guys
don't know what that is it's basically
where you sit in front of the camera for
10 minutes and just talk about whatever
but the whole point of this video is to
not edit anything out make no cuts have
no music playing in the background um
and this is this is gonna be hard I'm a
little nervous so let me put the the
timer on sorry you guys can't see that I
don't know why I'm showing you but it's
10 minutes so basically this tag was
created by John Green and I was tagged
by Megan Hughes and Lexie Lombard um and
I have to say this is probably my not
mine but like yeah normally I'll cut it
out but I can doubt getting nervous ah
um this is probably my favorite tag that
has ever been created because I don't
know I think the whole like story behind
it is really good basically this was
created in response to the whole essena
o'neill thing and i don't really want to
get too much into that because i feel
like there are so many people that have
made videos on the internet discussing
their opinions about all of it
if you guys want to know where my head's
at honestly just go watch Meghan's video
I will link it down below as well as
Lexi's um but I feel like what Megan
said um I agree with a lot and I think
she just really voiced her opinions well
and yeah so I think what she said was
yes good I I agree um but yeah I'm
excited to do this because I feel like I
don't know it's really it's really weird
being an Internet person and having all
these people kind of make all these
different you know assumptions about you
and all this stuff and I don't know it's
it's really weird because at the end of
the day
none of you guys well besides besides
the people that have met me you know
whether we've like bumped into each
other or whatever majority of you guys
have never met me before so you only see
what I decided to put out on the
Internet and so if I quickly make some
sort of comments um you know it's so
easy for someone who doesn't know me or
who wasn't there to make an entire story
surrounding that comment and thinking
you know that's why she said that or
that's why she thinks that when in
reality it might be something completely
different but the point is you only
heard that one little segment and so I
think this is this whole idea of this
sitting down no editing is really cool
because it just I don't know it feels
very like freeing being able to just sit
here and be like hey guys this is me
this is my thought process and you know
who knows if you will continue to watch
this or not I don't know if it's gonna
be interesting I don't even know what I
want to talk about um okay let's see
well so I don't brain fart ah um one of
the things that I actually wanted to
mention about I didn't really plan this
for you at all but something that kind
of I wanted to bring up was one part of
a Cena's video kind of really stood out
to me is when she was talking about her
younger self and I think this isn't the
part in the video when she started
getting a little more emotional and she
was saying how when she was younger she
would be spending her hours sitting at a
computer screen looking at these people
that she idolizes or wants to become or
you know looking at their bodies their
fame whatever it may be I kind of forgot
what she said because I haven't seen
that video in a while but she regrets
you know spending her life doing that
when she should be on a playground
meeting new people and actually
interacting with the real human beings
and living your life and making memories
and all that stuff and that's kind of
like a reoccurring thought in my head um
for the past few months I would say I
don't know lately I've been having a lot
of like teeny midlife crisis is what's
the plural of that I don't know um
basically me just having moments being
like what am I doing with my life
because I don't know with with my job
which is YouTube and the other things
that revolve around that and just my
lifestyle and stuff I have so many
different phases of life where either
I'm traveling for an entire month and
I'm busy and I'm either stress right
really happy about it and then there'll
be like a two-week period where I have
nothing to do besides film like my two
videos and then I'm sitting there like
what am i doing in my life um so I guess
that's why I mean have you lately
I don't really know um as of right now
very content but like I definitely have
the stopped processes but that kind of
goes into the whole like I know I'm just
growing up and I'm establishing the life
that you know I have or what am I even
saying now I don't know okay random
tangent whatever um when you guys have
to like speak in front of like a class
or if you're talking to someone that
you're like nervous or whatever and like
halfway into your sentence you just like
get inside your own head and you're like
what am I saying
that is happening to me right now or
adjusted sometimes that happens when I'm
filming like what's it called with a
crew or something but then usually I can
like snap out it really quick but it's
happening right now so you know Cara Lee
do anything about it um what was I
talking about
I forgot oh just the whole living your
life thing yeah so anyway so I've been
having a lot of these thoughts and I was
kind of comparing what my life used to
be like before you two before YouTube
and moving out to LA versus my life now
and I'm not saying that I don't like my
life right now because I absolutely love
it and I'm so grateful for it I love all
the people that I'm surrounded with and
yeah I wouldn't change anything but you
know obviously there's goods in there as
Bad's and one of the things that I've
been real
trying to change is how much I use the
Internet or I'm sitting wasting my hours
on these little devices right here
because I feel like the whole point of
life is to you know live in the present
and experience different emotions and
experience just like experience
different experiences well Claudia your
choice and wording is great today but
experience those things with the people
that you love and that you want to be
around so for example back at home
there were so many aspects of life that
I was like already kind of doing without
choice that would trigger different
emotions on me so for example I was on
my high school tennis team and I played
tennis and soccer and you know stuff
like that and those aspects of my life
triggered a competitive side of Claudia
and I loved that side of me because I
get so excited when I'm doing something
that kind of brings out you know my
competitive side and when you're doing
with others and stuff like that
and now living out here and having the
lifestyle that I do which is working at
home and you know it's kind of hard to
meet people that are not in this in the
industry out here because you're doing
so many things in relation to your job
that you're just kind of surrounded with
the same people so that's kind of a
whole another thing is meeting new
people that's why I love school because
you just had I talked about this in a
different video you they're like the
whole social aspect of being surrounded
with people that you might not not
necessarily even be friends with but you
have peers and you have different you
know types of relations with other
people so that's I have a different
thing but anyways um there's nothing out
here for me that um you know forces me
to kind of bring out my competitive side
unless I want it to and that's like kind
of the key word is unless I wanted to um
so I don't know I've been trying to do
different things to kind of you know
meet me
well and have those moments and
experiences that are a little out of the
box and different than my lifestyle
right now because unless I like unless I
want that stuff to happen it won't
happen um I feel like I'm preaching
right now oh my god having a
motivational speech but yeah so for
example a few weeks ago my friends and I
we decided out of the blue just to go
laser tagging something such a simple
idea honestly might be laying to some of
you guys but doing that was so much more
fun than any of the nights I've spent
sitting on this thing watching Vampire
Diaries like I don't know that was
really fun because it brought out my
competitive side and it was really fun
being able to do that with you know the
people vets are in my life that I love
and I want to do things like that with
or doing even just like carving pumpkins
or arts and crafts that's bringing out
your creative side or you know going to
a haunted house that brings out the
adrenaline of you know having fear and
like how often do you like really
experience that in your life unless you
want that a lot you know so I know I've
just been kind of having this little
like midlife crisis of I want to meet
more people and I want to kind of expand
the amount of memories and experiences
that I'm having and stuff because it's
so easy to just get in a rut and in a
routine and do things that you're
content with and you know that you know
you enjoy doing or it's it's like that
whole like homey safe feeling um so I
don't know that's like kind of something
that I've just been thinking about
lately even with my videos to like you
guys might notice that I've been kind of
creating different contents a little bit
especially that especially my last few
videos are a little bit different um the
night routine basically I knew right
away that I wanted to make some sort of
video that was a little bit more
challenging as far as the whole
cinematic you know aspect of it making
it look visually really pretty
editing it I knew I wanted to make a
video like that but I was worried that
if I made something a little more random
with the less searchable title people
wouldn't have recognized it so I you all
the time result that went so fast let me
finish my sentence blah
stop it says tap to stop but it wasn't
working um I knew that if I kind of
brought that idea into a more relatable
video that people enjoy naturally
watching which is a nighttime routine I
knew that it would at least spark
people's attention and hopefully give
them a reason to want to watch it and
then yeah so that worked out really well
and I'm really happy that a lot of
people were surprised by the video
because I think a lot of people were
just expecting something else and once
they saw that it was kind of cool or
even the video I did after that I don't
know when I'm uploading this so it might
be in my last video but the 40 emotions
tag super random has nothing to do with
my channel I'm sure like half of you
were just like this book this video is
pointless like you're you know a
lifestyle style guru this has nothing to
do their chat with your channel oh my
god I'm now tripping over my words I'm a
master now um so yeah I've been kind of
doing that with my channel lately I've
just been wanting to challenge myself
more because um I recently hit my
six-year anniversary on my channel which
is so crazy to say because I do not feel
like it's been six years but at the same
time you know I've been regularly
posting you know whether it's once a
week or a few times a month or even
multiple times a week whatever obviously
you know it always changes up but I've
been doing this um first six years and I
remember one night just having this
realization of like oh my gosh I is that
all I wanted to do like just you know
haul videos and makeup tutorials and
things like that like where do I want my
channel to go am i proud of where it is
now
things like that and I just feel like
I've been creating the same content for
so long and it's just like different
versions of the same stuff and I was
getting a little sad because I was like
I just I'm not that kind of person I
love love of love you know challenging
myself or trying different things so I
know the whole idea of like oh my gosh
Claudia you've been doing the same thing
for practically six years like how how
have you been okay with it and stuff
like that but I know I started watching
some my videos back and I realized that
I kind of been you know doing things a
little bit differently for a while
without even realizing it like I was
watching my other nighttime routine that
I filmed back in January and it was kind
of more like a skit form where I'm
pretending to get interrogated is that
the word by like a police and so I'm
like going through my night your
nighttime routine as there as I had true
in the background being like so what
were you doing and this day at this time
and stuff so that was kind of like a
nice relief to be able to see that be
like wait no no no Claudia you have been
doing that you haven't kind of you know
trying to do things differently but
sticking in the same realm of things but
why am I even talking about this now um
yeah that's kind of to answer some of
your questions because I feel like some
people have been other tweeting or
commenting being like we're like what is
happening to your channel and it's not
changing in any way I'm still gonna make
Beauty videos and stuff like that but I
definitely do want to expand um you know
my content as far as what I'm creating
in the level of creativity that's going
into it
because I know at the end of the day
like this channel is mine and it's only
mine and it becomes whatever I wanted or
created whatever I want it to be what am
I been saying I'm going so past ten
minutes what I'm at fourteen minutes I'm
so sorry but I'm into this right now
um was I saying the UM shoot oh my god
no no I lost that I lost it um
this is what the coffee did to me okay
since we're past 10 minutes I'm gonna
like reworked okay since we're past the
10-minute mark I'm gonna cut right now
so technically I did not fail this
challenge because I'm now going past but
I want to reflect my thoughts because
I'm all over the place right now so hold
on let me think
and know what I want to say okay so
being a youtuber and this is so funny oh
my god I really hope you guys enjoy this
video because it's so fricking all over
the place um being a youtuber you start
to fall into these certain you know
molds and expectations that people
create for you and it's it's crazy
because I started my youtube channel
solely as a hobby and making this
switchover from okay this is a hobby and
now this is kind of becoming more my
life and now this is becoming my you
know my current job what you know has
the money coming in and it's allowing me
to do different things now which you
know essentially obviously YouTube isn't
forever so right now I'm kind of working
on branching out figuring out what I
want to do after this but anyways the
whole transition of okay this just
turned into hobby now this is kind of
like a bigger deal in my life people
start creating these expectations and
you know they'll will get upset if you
miss an uploading day and they'll or
they'll get upset if your video is not
what they expected it to be or you're
starting to create different content and
all that stuff and that's a really scary
thought because at the end of the day
this is just a website of me creating
things that I passionately passionately
just want to work on work on and share
to you guys and so I guess what I'm
trying to say is I don't really know
what the future of my channel will be
because um you know people's what's the
word people's interest that's forward um
because people's interests are always
changing so if I'm having a phase in
life where I just want to challenge
myself a little bit more and do you know
different types of videos then I would
just hope that you guys would support it
because at the end
day um you know you're watching these
videos hopefully just because you're
somehow interested in me or inspired by
me or whatever it may be and this is
just me being me this is me not wanting
to follow any type of expectation or
mold and that is basically what I want
to say is that I just want to create
more videos that I genuinely have an
interest in making because they're
definitely videos that I've made on my
channel where I didn't feel as
passionate and I just felt like I had to
put it up because it was either getting
really requested or you know people
expect me to do it so that's like
something that I'm really working on is
just wanting to create content that I
just really wanted freaking make for you
guys and the only thing I could hope for
is for you guys to you know accept it
and just enjoy it and not take it too
seriously because I'm you know I'm just
making these videos because I want to so
on that note I think we're gonna end off
today's video I don't really know what
this was this is I'm really interested
to read your guys's comments hopefully
it wasn't too bad um but yeah if you
guys enjoyed today's video please give
it a thumbs up if you guys want to see
more stuff like this maybe this can
become a thing like either on this
channel or even my second channel um I
know I feel like I don't really make a
lot of videos where I just kind of sit
and talk to you guys like this usually
I'm either teaching you guys something
or showing you guys something and stuff
like that so I really like being able to
just connect with you guys oh by the way
on this topic
um vlog miss is coming up if you guys
don't follow my second channel it's
beyond beauty star TV I'll link it down
below but I pretty much this vlog every
so often honestly I should be doing it a
lot more because you guys seem to really
really like my vlogs because it's so
much easier to be able to connect with
me and relate with me and kind of
you know get a better picture of what's
going on in here because you know it's a
lot more personal um what's the college
so yeah if you guys want to subscribe to
my second channel I'm going to be
vlogging every single day in December
and I'm so so excited it's gonna be my
third I listed four it's gonna be my
third here doing it um so it's going to
be good I'm excited and yeah I think
that's it for today's video I hope you
guys enjoyed it um I will be tagging
some youtubers down below I don't know
who yet because I'm so scatterbrained
but I will have them down there so if
your youtuber check down there and see
if I see if I tagged you hopefully do it
um and yeah I love you guys so much and
thank him for sitting through so much of
this video this video was this was a
hefty one okay
