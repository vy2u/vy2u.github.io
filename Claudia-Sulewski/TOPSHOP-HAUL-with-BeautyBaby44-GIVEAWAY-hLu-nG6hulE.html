awesome super great we're gonna get
started with the hall I don't usually
perform for an audience we have an
audience right now I'm showing over here
like wave you guys can hear away alright
so the first thing that I got from
Topshop would have to be this little
white crop top right here and I like a
little mesh at the top and it's like a
v-neck super cute it look cute with like
different skirts and stuff like that
alright let's see the first thing I kind
of like office it from that it's a good
it's a sweater and this is like it's a
little bit early to get this it's LA in
August but it's the only sweater item
that I purchased so it's fine just have
some lace and some like some half
sleeves raised the half sleeve it's been
our night time that's good it gets
colder internationally everything so
next up I've got a pair of jeans and
I've recently become obsessed with the
Jamie jeans they just fit so so these
are like a dark gray charcoal color and
then they have a rips at the knees
yeah they're high-waisted
and I know all this you know they just
make that way it's really yeah but look
I think it's all if they really do they
hung the thighs the boy it's just it's
the whole package so I got these jeans
and I really like them what did you get
next Lindsey next this is kind of boring
but you know I got a necklace I tried it
on
thank you guys yesterday it's like it
was your tight little bit a little bit
longer I don't even know what it looks
like on because I just tried it on for
them pretty basic it's cute though I got
this shirt without looks familiar
I really hated doing this anywhere so we
ended up getting the same shirt because
we are both obsessed with the strong we
didn't even know you picked it up and I
was like I bought that one yeah we're
like oh you get a good buy the same day
no I didn't know that it's just white
and it's got all the signs in a circle
and I love shirts like these oh alright
next I got something that I pretty much
have to show one of these and like
everybody that I've ever gotten for an
entire life it's a circle skirt I really
like this color for the Fall it'll be
perfect I just like it you know pretty
basic it's gonna go with a lot - yeah I
like that coming key to tie in with the
whole green theme that we're doing right
now I got this little skirt type thing
no it's so cute and it's got like shades
of blue yellow green white and it just
looks like a little like a schoolgirl -
yeah that makes me feel preppy and I
live
yeah like clueless ask and stuff okay
not slow these are a bit weird no but I
tried them on and I really liked that
kind of looks like a pajama pants and
he's got some pockets it kind of snagged
a little bit right here but like an
entourage they they do hug the butt so
they still hug the buck out
don't worry they're not saggy the but I
got a necklace to match with these but I
think that's in my part of the video so
stay tuned giggling laughing oh you know
a nice item that I purchased is this
white t-shirt but it's just got a little
extra something something on the sleeves
and on the bottom it has a really cool
like circular crochet pattern type thing
I just thought it was kind of like a
different spin off of like a regular
thing
yeah I like it it's cool it's cool
thanks I got this little cropped plane
sweatshirt and I'm not the sleeves
rolled up and when I tried it on it
looked really cute like this like I know
it's just this wet truth but a little
this is so Hugh I didn't even see this
yeah they had it in coral too and I was
tempted to get the coral but it's thin
it's good for like le not perfect okay
the next item that I purchased is a
shirt / dress I know or does address
last night long enough for a dress it's
really funny so it's just white and it's
got black writing on it and it says hi
my name is blank and then it says my
room number is blank and this shirt
actually came with like a little Sharpie
type thing you like iron it and it stays
on forever but the color was red and I
only wear a lot of red so I think I'm
just I think I just like jogging or just
like leave it plain I didn't end up
playing this little dress was on sale
for like 24 dollars or something so I
was really really excited about that
what do I got Al Roker okay so I have
all wrong this is a romper I have a
romper that is like this it's yours I'm
wearing weren't so many times it's navy
blue with the pink hearts and it's like
a cross a little cross C thing type it's
very long it's gonna be in a lot in
different to show you can connect it
like it goes across in the body - all
right there's a legend
angle it's kind of hard to show you but
yeah it's just a flowy black romper fits
great blue
lastly we each got a pair of shoes so
the boots that I got look like this they
probably look pretty familiar because a
lots of people she is wearing them
exactly like right now but they're just
black and then they have how would you
describe this some buckles some buckles
some they're cutouts cutouts there you
go that's what I was looking for yeah
