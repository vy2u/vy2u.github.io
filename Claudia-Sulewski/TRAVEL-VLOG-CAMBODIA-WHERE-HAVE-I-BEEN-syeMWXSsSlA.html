where the hell I've been the ladies a
new show and I blogged so much a bit
ported on way too many flights traveled
so much but I got to visit some really
cool places and get to experience stuff
that I will never forget it's pretty
cool a whole ways finding time to be an
idiot laughing a bunch and celebrating
those around me gonna screw it up to
kick off the sharing of these memories I
want to give you a look into my
unforgettable trip to Siem Reap Cambodia
I spent a week in this beautiful country
with love and Alina the founders of
fresh and the rest of their team we
explored sacred temples meditated with
Buddhist monks did a little yoga
experience the culture surrounding the
lotus flower and celebration of some of
their newer products to say that I was
excited is an understatement this is the
quest we through my life I've been
traveling for like 18 hours I'm sweaty
tired just checked into my hotel room
and I'm freaking out because this is so
cool so I want to give you guys a little
walk through walking through the front
door on the right side you've got two
wardrobes and this little kind of like
island thing with super pretty flowers a
little note from fresh and some little
things that I'm gonna dig into in a
second and then in the center of the
room what we have my bed which I'm so
excited to sleep in tonight we're here
we've got a little living area it goes
straight into the bathroom and this you
guys is this not like the most relaxing
gorgeous environment to ever be it what
and then we just have am assuming toilet
to shower let's see what's in here
toilet oh my god this shower oh I don't
want to go out there right now cuz it's
super humid but I have
own private pool on our first day we
spent a good bit of time market shopping
and just visiting the town going up and
down the streets and looking into little
stores and shops oh did you think this
was a book you thought wrong
they're clearly a headed local
lotus-flower apartment canoeing through
the Lotus farm was such a surreal
experience it was so so beautiful and
the weather was perfect and discerning
about the different uses of these
flowers I was pretty mind blown you can
use them for food and clothing and
medicinal purposes skincare to me it's
kind of crazy so they look this flower
is gonna go back by itself again where
are we eating lunch
our other boat is
yeah we just got back from all of
today's adventures and I come back to
this waiting for me in my room
you had a little incense setup happening
over here definitely gonna light that
and a lotus bath also decided that I'm
for sure gonna go skinny-dipping in this
pool because no one can see us and
really want to do that as well
waking up before the Sun for our visit
to the temples were so so worth it you
can't help but just whisper and take in
all the history that's right in front of
you this is probably not appropriate to
say at a temple but I've never had more
oh this tree trunk big temple that we're
currently touring right now it's a
Buddhist temple this is where they shot
Tomb Raider so doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
that's cool being such a fan of fresh
for so long I was so excited for the
product sharing session and just getting
to learn more about the products and the
new ones coming out also it was just
hilarious because love is like the
funniest person ever and we followed our
last night into a temple dinner which
was absolutely breathtaking
you have a very clear or they're losing
patience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
