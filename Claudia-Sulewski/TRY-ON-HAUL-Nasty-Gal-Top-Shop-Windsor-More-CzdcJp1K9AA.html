channel today I'm going to be filming a
haul video for you guys
so I'll be showing you a few things or
many of the things that I recently
purchased but before I get started I
quickly wanted to thank you guys for
your super sweet and supportive comments
on my last video which I will link right
here if you guys haven't seen it but I
worked really really hard on it and I'm
so happy with how it turned out and all
the feedback that I'm getting so I just
wanted to thank you guys because I
didn't really film an outro to that
video and it just meant a lot so I'm
really happy that you guys enjoyed it
but that is all that I have to say in
this intro so let's get started the
first store that I went to it was a
wasteland which is kind of like a
high-end thrift store slash store here
in LA it's also from brands so you can
definitely find these online but I got
two different jacket type things from
the brand cameo but the first one is
this jacket right here I'm aware that it
is summer but I definitely feel like
this is a summery jacket it's kind of
lighter a little fancier so I probably
wear it you know indoors somewhere with
a dress maybe I don't know when I'm
gonna wear a dress indoors next but you
know where it'll happen okay I
absolutely love the pattern of this coat
it's just super like honestly I don't
know how to explain this but black/white
it's kind of stripy ish and yeah I just
really like be very like clean and
modern cut that it has to it and it's
friggin awesome so I'm really excited to
wear this the second thing that I got
from wasteland is actually a best which
is really weird coming from me because I
am NOT alright at least never was a vest
person but I've been into them lately
I bought two this one is really really
kind of out there and edgy it's a little
oversized
and it's kind of got the same vibe as
like a leather jacket one but the
material is really cool it's kind of
like a waterproof thicker material and
basically I just wanna go back
I wear this because it's just so edgy
and cool and you just don't want to mess
with me when I'm wearing this I swear
that my attitude changes when I wear
this next up I have two purses that I
wanted to show you guys so the first one
was actually a gift so I did not
purchase it myself but I just wanted to
give a huge huge thank you to style hall
which is the network that I'm signed
with but they bought me a gift for
reaching a million subscribers and I'm
just so in love with it
so it is this purse right here I will
have the name of it down here because I
don't know the specific one I've kind of
been using this like every single day
since I got it but it's still pretty new
so like maybe a week maybe less so I
just want to thank stylehaul for giving
me this bag it was just so sweet of you
guys and I just I don't have any words I
love it so much so I wanted to quickly
talk about that I've got one more bag to
show you guys and I actually bought this
one in New York City and it's a lot
bigger it's also black and leather and
it's got silver hardware which is my
favorite but I got this bag from the
store called
and Other Stories it was my first time
going there and I freaking love that
store I wish it is out here in LA but
it's kind of like an adult version of
Topshop that's like how I would describe
it so I'm going to be trading this one
like my work bag to throw either like my
laptop in or you know notebooks paper
pens that kind of stuff and just kind of
bring it around with me whatever I'm
going on shoots or meetings or whatever
I love it enough said
next up I have a few things from a nasty
gal so the first one is a shirt and it
looks like this it's a little white crop
top but it's super fun because the
sleeves go wider at the end so it's
super like 70s inspired but I think it
looks so cute actually show you guys
like photo that I posted with it
recently and I just love it I cannot
wait to start styling this shirt next up
I got this little bralette shirt type
thing it's like an extremely short crop
top but it's black it has white on it
and
go to mesh and I just thought this was
really cute also for the summertime so I
got that you will notice that I bought a
lot of black and white things like
pretty much everything that I'm about to
show you guys is black away but that's
okay
the night shirt that I got was this crop
top I've posted a lot of instagrams with
it and I think it's so cool I love the
little string and kind of ring detail in
the front and I think it's so fun I love
it
I've got two things that I want to show
you guys from Topshop so the first one
is a second vest so this one is kind of
like a medium grey it's got white little
buttons on it I'm really into the whole
vest trend right now it's a trend I
don't really know but I really am
enjoying this and I think it's super
super cute then lastly I've been
obsessed with these little crop tops and
I pretty much own every single color
that Topshop sells these in so starting
off with the shape I am super in love
with like high-necked crop tops I just
think they look really flattering on my
body shape and they just fit really well
but I also really like the material
because it's a lot thicker so I actually
don't have to wear a bra with these
shirts which is really great because you
don't see your nipples and you get cold
maybe TMI I don't care but I really
really like these they're just really
comfortable and that is why i justified
buying a bunch of them but here's the
white one next up I got a bunch of
things from a Windsor so I'm going to
start off with actually the shirt that
I'm wearing right now it looks like this
and it once again it's got that high
neckline cut to it which I really love I
was talking to Lexington for this video
and we both agreed that this shirt gives
us such a Barbie flight-attendant vibe I
feel like this is the shirt that they
wore maybe not but I feel like it just
gives that vibe so I kind of feel like a
like a Barbie flight attendant wearing
this shirt but that's really irrelevant
and random the next shirt that I got
from Windsor looks like this
so the
this one is really really fun because
the front of it is super simple it just
has a very deep v-neck and it's striped
but back
what BAM is super knotted and crisscross
and it just looks so cool so I can just
picture wearing this shirt with like a
bond to show off the back maybe like a
maxi skirt or something I also got this
striped crop top so it kind of crosses
in the front and then also goes down the
bottom and once again the material is
super like thick and stretchy so I
really really like this top next up I
got a maxi dress and I'm really excited
to wear this one because I don't own a
maxi dress like this so starting off
with the top gotta have the high
neckline
I don't way too many high neckline
things but it's black and white striped
and it's really fun because it has these
two slits in the front so I'm definitely
going to wear like a black skirt
underneath this but it basically just
shows your legs off very nicely and it's
super long flowy it's just a really
great casual dress to wear for you know
the spring and summer time next up I got
a little romper and I'm obsessed with
the cut of this romper I already own a
few like this and they just look really
cool and pretty and flattering so when I
saw this I knew I had to get it but it
is super colorful we are now introducing
color into the video hello
this guy kind of like a v-neck in the
front and it just has a little shorts on
the bottom so I thought that cut was
great I love the colors in it I think
it's super fun
next up I got some crazier short so
these are also colorful and they're kind
of tropical and floral themed so they
kind of have that whole skort vibe but
yeah I thought these
really fun and crazy and as long as i
pair them with a really simple top you
got a good solid outfit right there so i
only have two more things to show you
guys the first is a pair of sunglasses
so these are all social windsor but i
thought these were super cute because i
love the shape of them and i also love
how they have like that clear kind of
part to them on the top very fun I think
my favorite sunglasses shape right now
is the cat eye so these are great I love
them super excited to rhythm and lastly
I have a pair of shoes and these are
actually little gladiator sandals I
actually have been wanting to get shoes
like this for a long time because
they're the perfect amount of casual but
still cute so they look like this
they're just black and of course they've
got silver on them so I'm super into
that yeah they just kind of cross in the
front and they just have zippers on the
back so this will be great for everyday
wear and I just know I'll be getting a
ton of use out of them so I'm very
excited about these so that is it for
today's video I hope you guys enjoyed it
