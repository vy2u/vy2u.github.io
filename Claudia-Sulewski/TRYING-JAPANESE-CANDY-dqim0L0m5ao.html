here we are yet again eating candy a few
months ago I found myself trying out
different British candy and you guys
seem to really like that video it
reached like a million views I didn't
realize that me eating candy would be
that interesting to watch but hey it's a
win-win for everybody
so last night drew and I went to a
Japanese supermarket and picked up a lot
of candy oh yeah I don't even know where
to begin
okay we're gonna start off with these
they kind of look like fake little
icecream cones but they got like air
pockets in them so we'll see how that
goes oh there's so much I'm going to
start off with chocolate it's hard okay
this is really good oh yeah and we have
strawberry mmm that was way too sweet
all at all I give these a five out of
five that was a good way to start on the
video next up we've got these little
hard candies and my guess is that
they're going to be kind of busy because
there's soda on the front so they're
just little hard balls I'm trying to
crack into it but I like the taste a lot
it was kind of fizzy in the middle I was
honestly expecting it to be a little bit
more but not bad it just kind of tastes
sweet like I wouldn't buy it again
four out of five the next one is
actually a drink and I really wanted to
try this one because I'm hoping that
it's disgusting because there's a scoop
of ice cream on the packaging so I don't
know if this is supposed to taste like
melted ice cream or something this is
gonna fizz there we go
oh my god what does it smell like it
smells like Gatorade that's really good
it literally tastes like blue Gatorade
no no no no no no no no Capri Sun
packets this is a Capri Sun packet pouch
packet Capri Sun pouch is it a pouch
okay I don't know okay
site about these this is what they look
like I don't know what is inside of them
I'm gonna give these like a 2 out of 5
and not because it necessarily tastes
bad but I just don't understand this
concept I don't know if your sister like
put something inside of them
comment down below bet if you guys know
what this is because what are you next
up we've got something at chocolatey
I've got high expectations for this 100
oh my god guys a whiff of chocolate just
like came into the room that right there
is a chocolate fill Chris on this is so
good this honestly might be my favorite
I've had so far we're gonna throw in
something very questionable this
whatever this is I'm a little terrified
they look like little packets of some
sort of jelly oh I'm so scared what is
this doesn't smell like anything oh my
god there's juice like protruding on the
top okay
the juice is now gone
so that's great oh no mm-hmm
oh my god ill that just made me shiver I
don't know what that was but it was not
jelly I swear to God if this ends up
being baby food I don't trust it I
didn't like it I'm gonna give that
definitely a 0 out of 5 stars so the
next one I'm excited for because there
are a few steps that you have to do so
this one's kind of like a little toy oh
my god it smells like bubblegum
oh this is bubblegum so we've got some
sort of chocolate sauce sprinkles and
gum let's just squeeze that in there
that's not gum right is it good
I can't go seriously I'm gonna give this
a 2 out of 5 so the next one I'm going
to try I'm a little skeptical about here
they are from afar they look kind of
like those little mochi balls which is
like ice cream covered in dough but
these weren't in the freezers so that's
not what they are but the reason why I'm
a little terrified of these is because
there are marijuana leaves on the
packaging I'm almost definitely
confident that you can't be selling weed
to the general public in California in a
random supermarket oh this is gross this
is gross it is so mushy okay nope the
center of these are starting to remind
me of those weird little cup things I
ate earlier I can't do it so the next
thing that I found I had to buy because
this this does not look like candy I
have a feeling that you might have to
put these tablets into like a glass of
water so I have water on the side wait
it kind of tasted like fun dip but more
fizzy if that makes any sense
but we're going to try putting it in the
glass of water just in case because I
could totally be doing this wrong so
we're going to let that sit for a little
the next candy I actually do believe
you're supposed to put into water
because there is definitely a glass of
some sort of liquid on the front and
they look like little cubes go into
water am I crazy for assuming these
things like it okay well oh my god
imagine taking snow and pressing it
really tight but also mixing in sugar
and then dumping like toothpaste on it
that is what this tastes like No zero so
we've actually got one last thing to try
and these actually look really good
for them might possibly be gum but also
it might just be like chewy candy
impress me impress me oh how do I feel
about this it basically just tastes like
a giant nerd like a giant purple nerd
I'm gonna give you like a 3 out of 5
because you you would serve no purpose
in my life guys something is happening
with the first tablet I think I'm on to
something what's why not try it just
kidding
don't try it so that is all the candy
that I purchased last night I hope you
