channel today's video is going to be a
collective haul and I've got some good
stuff to show you guys also I do want to
mention that I will be showing more
accessories and kind of more fun pieces
because as you guys know I wear pretty
simple clothing when it comes to shirts
and bottoms stuff like that so I decided
to skip all that and just show you guys
more interesting stuff I don't even know
how to begin okay whoo alright we're
going to start off with swimsuits I got
two of them from Nasty Gal so this is
the first one it's so cool it's a
two-piece and it looks like this I love
it I think it looks so sporty but edgy
at the same time and then the bottoms
really sold me it they're so cute
they're super cheeky but so cool so cool
this is definitely an interesting piece
it's actually a one-piece and showing it
to you guys like this isn't going to do
much so I'm going to post a photo of
what it looks like on the model on the
site basically it's a one-piece that
crosses in the back but from the front
it looks like a two-piece and the
material of this bathing suit is so
stretchy so thick and smooth I love the
color it's like a peachy pink possibly
take some instagrams in it we're getting
there I joined gym
we're getting there next up I got two
hats these are both from Urban
Outfitters I got them online I knew I
needed to get this the second I saw it
it's a Chicago Blackhawks hat and I love
the colors of it it's like a pebble
stone darkish gray and I really like the
black netting in the back so I've been
wearing that a bunch and then also I got
this little baby blue hat from the brand
reason and I really liked how they were
color blocking with the lid also the
back is really cute to have fun
love baseball caps protect your face
from those UV rays lately I've been
having a lot of fun doing different
braids like today I made a little braid
up top here and then curls my hair just
put in a ponytail but trailing off of
that I've been getting a lot of hair
accessories lately both of these are
from Urban Outfitters so for starters I
got these giant silver clips
first of all throwback to these clips
because I used to wear
every single day when I was little and I
just think it's so cool how these are
giant when buying these I envisioned
myself wearing them with like a middle
part and then super high up kind of
tight on both sides and then having my
hair super curly on the bottom
I can't imagine everyone loving that
hairstyle but I just think it would look
so cool maybe some red lips I don't know
so I'm really excited about these giant
clips and then next up I got these
little hair rings which I've been seeing
everywhere lately I really think they're
going to become a trend this summer and
the festival season in general basically
they're just a bunch of little silver
rings with beads on them and you
basically just loop them into your hair
as you are creating braids or any type
of hairstyle and I am definitely
bringing these with me to Coachella I am
so excited to finish off the accessories
I got some sunglasses and these are
actually my first pair of ray-bans I
can't believe it's taken me 20 years to
get a pair of ray-bans because I feel
like everyone has them but I am so so
happy with these they are the classic
aviator style but they are the silver
reflective ones this is what they look
like oh I love them so much they're so
comfortable they're so light on your
face they don't fall off these
particular glasses were around $200
what's in dollars umm dollars which is
pretty expensive but I think it's a
great investment you can just tell how
high-quality they are and it's amazing
the words I use to describe things okay
next up we have a bunch of shoes I'm
gonna start off with sneakers I've got
two of them I was recently invited to
check out and completely raid the adidas
showroom out here in LA which was a very
magical day for me because you guys know
how much I love adidas and yeah I got to
choose a bunch of different clothing
pieces and shoes and all that stuff and
I really want to show you guys these two
pairs because I have been obsessed with
them so for starters we've got these
they're the top tens and I love the
reptile skin pattern that it has stripes
on the top and the bottom I don't know
what it is about high-top shoes but I
just
some type of way throw em on it feels
good it feels really really good to wear
high tops so you make me feel good
talking to my shoes now and then the
other pair look like this so these are a
little bit more sporty err kind of look
like a running shoe you can definitely
still style them really really well once
again I love the reptile pattern that it
has going on in the back it's the
perfect kind of splash of detail you
literally feel like you're walking on an
air mattress that is how I would
describe it next up we got some booties
and I'm really excited to talk about
these because they're not just regular
normal heeled booties okay there's more
to that don't judge a shoe by its
appearance so these are from Jeffrey
Campbell and the cool thing about these
is that they're actually rain boots yes
these are rain boots you can walk into
puddles you can walk around in dirt the
entire shoe is all rubber it's like
matte black there is no way that water
can seep through any of the seams
they're very very comfortable because
they're rubber and they look so cute
they have the shape of your average just
black heels booty so I actually think
I'm going to be wearing these to
Coachella
honestly if they get messy or muddy I
can just wash them off wipe them down
and they'll be good as new and the last
pair of shoes that I want to show you
guys are from Topshop they look like
this and Lexi actually had these shoes
last year and she would always wear them
when we went out because they're super
comfortable yet they give you so much
height when I saw that they came back
into stock I had to get my own pair I
love how they give off a slight retro
vibe I don't know I really like it I
love the strap at the top too and
they're super cute they're comfortable
they're great for the daytime or the
nighttime nude shoes elongate your legs
which is always a plus so good deal I've
got a few clothing pieces to show you
guys for starters this denim skirt right
here oh yeah we're jumping back to the
early 2000s it's so funny because when I
was younger I own probably about ten
different pairs of jeans skirts I love
them so much but they have come back
into my life guys these are from Urban
Outfitters I like how it's frayed at the
bottom love the color of it and yeah I
have been wearing this skirt so often if
not too often lately the next few things
that I'm going to show you guys I feel
like I will slightly get judged for them
because I know that they're not going to
be everyone's style but I am just going
through this phase where I am really
into these pieces one day I was shopping
online on Urban Outfitters and I thought
to myself hey I've never checked out the
men's clothing so sure enough
Claudia went on to the men's side of the
website and did a little bit of shopping
I got some men's clothing for starters I
got this t-shirt super long it's got a
little pocket with a red heart and it
says lover I think it's so cute oh yeah
this shirt is actually a men's
extra-large and the reason I got it so
big was because I wanted to wear it as a
t-shirt dress so I've honestly been
wearing this everywhere whether it's to
bed around my house or out I'm all for a
good t-shirt dress and I just like how
simple and cute it is this is where it
starts getting interesting there's a
specific style of shirt that I've been
loving lately it kind of has the shape
of the nutty which is a hoodie without a
hood or crewneck whatever you guys want
to call it but rather than having a
thicker material I have been buying
long-sleeve shirts that have that shape
but they have the thin material of a
shirt so for starters we've got you guys
can already see we've got this black one
that says PlayStation we've got all of
these words and designs on the sleeves
it's such a boyish shirt but I'm so in
love with it
audio is just going through a manly face
right now I grew up playing PlayStation
with my brothers and here we are now so
started from the bottom and we're still
at the bottom continuing with that style
of t-shirt I also got this white one and
I think this is actually a woman's shirt
but it's a Lou
toons shirt so that's what looks like on
the front my favorite part is the sleeve
it says Looney Toons on the sleeve and
yeah once again I'm loving the oversized
long-sleeved tee t-shirts the last shirt
that I want to show you guys I actually
got from the Melrose trading post which
is kind of like a flea market out here
in LA where a bunch of different people
can sell their things you can find a lot
of cool and unique pieces so if you guys
have any near in your town I definitely
recommend going but I got this baggy
t-shirt it's black and it says Jurassic
Park on it I'm so into it I yes I feel
like this is equivalent to buying your
favorite youtubers merch and never being
able to go to one of their meet ups
because I will never get to go to
Jurassic Park
I only have one last piece to show you
guys and it is a black denim jacket I
got it from Nasty Gal it was on sale the
pattern inside is pretty interesting you
don't see it when you're wearing it but
I just love the fit of it it's got a
very loose baggy boyfriend jacket style
to it and yeah I'm loving it I'm loving
it so that is it for today's video I
