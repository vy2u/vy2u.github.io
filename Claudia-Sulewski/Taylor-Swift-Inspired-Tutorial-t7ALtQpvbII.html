my first celebrity inspired face makeup
tutorial and it is off of this picture
of taylor swift and i'm just going to
sing apart she has really really pretty
like red lips and then um her eyes are
very neutral and shimmery but then they
have little bit of gold on the bottom
and a very thick eyeliner on the top and
it's really bronzy and glowing and i
really really like it so i'm going to be
showing you guys my intake on this photo
right now before i start on anything
else i'm first going to moisturize my
lips so first I'm going to grab Urban
Decay's I shadow primer potion and I'm
just going to apply that all over the
lids
next I'm going to choose a very shimmery
skin toned eyeshadow and I'm just going
to apply this all over my lids
after that I'm going to choose an
eyeshadow that's a little bit lighter
than the one we used before and this is
just from a little quad that i got from
lancome and this eyeshadow is a little
bit more of like a sham painting type of
eye shadow so i'm just going to apply
that into the inner tear duct to
highlight it then i'm going to grab this
Stila duo like eye shadow duel thing in
salloum and with a crease brush i'm
going to choose the darker shade out of
the two and i'm just going to apply that
into my crease
once you're done with that grab a big
and fluffy brush and just make sure to
blend everything out
so now going back to the eyeshadow that
we use before i'm just going to use that
to highlight my brow bone and that's
basically it for the top so now i'm
going to grab Jesse's girl I shadow
transformer and I'm just going to apply
this on my lower lash line this will
help the eyeshadow from falling off
during the day and just sticking on so
then I'm going to grab a loose eyeshadow
from motives and of course I dropped it
it's in a shade l and into this really
pretty like Goldie bronzy eyeshadow so
just taking a little angled brush i'm
just going to tap that on my lower lash
line
so then grab that big rush again and
just blend everything out so the lines
aren't as harsh so once you're done with
that to scrub your favorite eyeliner and
I'm going to be using agile Einar from
wet and wild and just create a line on
your upper lash line and you can make
this a lot thicker if you wanted to
because in the picture is pretty thick
but I just decided to make it a little
bit thinner and in the picture then you
want to curl your lashes in the plan
so now onto the lips you can use any red
lipstick if you want but i chose the
Loreal infallible lip color in the shade
beyonce red and i'm just going to fly
that all over my lips
you
the real
