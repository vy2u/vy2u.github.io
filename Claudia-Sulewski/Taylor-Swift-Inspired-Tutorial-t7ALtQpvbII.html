doing my first celebrity inspired face
makeup tutorial and it is off of this
picture of Taylor Swift and I'm just
going to sing upon it
she has really really pretty like red
lips and then her eyes are very neutral
and shimmery but then they have relative
gold on the bottom and a very thick
eyeliner on the top and it's really
bronzing and glowy and I really really
like it so I'm going to be showing you
guys my intake on this photo right now
before I start on anything else I'm
first going to moisturize my lips
so first I'm going to grab open Decay's
eyeshadow primer potion and I'm just
gonna apply that all over the lids
next I'm going to choose a very shimmery
skin toned eyeshadow and I'm just gonna
apply this all over my lids
after that I'm going to choose an
eyeshadow that's a little bit lighter
than the one we used before and this is
just from a little quad that I got from
Lancome and this eyeshadow is a little
bit more of like a sham painting
type of eyeshadows so I'm just going to
apply that into the inner tear-duct to
highlight it then I'm going to grab this
Stila duo like eyeshadow duo thing in
Salome and with a crease brush I'm going
to choose the darker shade out of the
two and I'm just going to apply that
into my crease
once you're done with that grab a big
and fluffy brush and just make sure to
blend everything else
so now going back to the eyeshadow that
we use before I'm just gonna use that to
highlight my brow bone and that's
basically it for the top so now I'm
gonna grab Jesse's girl I shadow
transformer and I'm just gonna apply
this on my lower lash line this will
help the eyeshadow from falling off
during the day and just sticking on so
then I'm gonna grab a loose eyeshadow
for motives and of course I dropped it
it's in a shade L and it's this really
pretty like Goldy bronzy eyeshadow so
just taking a little angled brush I'm
just going to tap that on my lower lash
line
so then grab that big brush again and
just blend everything out so the lines
aren't as harsh so once you're done with
that just grab your favorite eyeliner
and I'm going to be using a gel eyeliner
from Wet n Wild and just create a line
on your upper lash line and you can make
this a lot thicker if you wanted to
because in the picture is pretty thick
but I just decided to make it a little
bit thinner and in the picture then you
want to curl your lashes
so now on to the lips you can use any
red lipstick if you want but I chose the
L'Oreal infallible lip color in the
shades Beyonce red and I'm just going to
apply that all over my lips</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
