tutorial for you guys and today it's a
male tutorial and it is kind of like a
North Pole inspired nail tutorial so
this is how it looks so you can see the
main theme is just like snowy french
tips so it looks like the ground and
they're still on it and they're snow
falling and then the middle finger has
an igloo on it and the thumb has penguin
on it so that's how they look and also
if it's too hard for you to make the
igloo or the penguin you can also adjust
do this and have like a little snowy
manicure so I just want to quickly show
you guys that and also I don't know if
you can see but I put this one nail
polish on that has like a bunch of
sparkles and I thought it looked really
cute so keep watching if you guys want
to find out how i created this snap
tutorial look and it's about it so keep
watching
make sure your file your nails however
you want to i like to square my nails so
now you're going to take any top coat oh
I mean base coat and you're just going
to apply that on to all your nails to
create those little snowy french tips
you are going to need some kind of white
nail polish and you're just going to
messily apply it on to the tips of your
fingernails make sure that you include
the little hills and bumps and you do
not want this to be perfect so now that
you don't that we're going to be working
on the pinky the ring finger and the
index finger so you're going to need a
surface some kind of toothpick and of
course the white nail polish and just
start drawing dots all over your nails
and this will give the effect of falling
snow it should look something like this
so now for the middle finger I actually
forgot to press the record button but
all I did was create a half circle on
the tip of my finger nail so that's how
it looks so now you are going to need
some kind of blue nail polish and a
black nail polish so basically all
you're going to do is create the outline
of the snow since we covered that up and
also outline the actual big glue itself
now take any black nail polish and we
are going to draw the opening of the
igloo towards the bottom above the snow
obviously so it should look something
like that so now just take the blue
again and outline the opening and also
you're going to start drawing horizontal
lines and vertical lines and this will
give the effect of the snow bricks on
the igloo and of course this does not
have to be perfect at all as you can see
mine isn't perfect at all so just kind
of free hand this and I think maybe a
small brush would be better but yeah you
can use a toothpick like I did so now
take a white nail polish and just create
the snow like you did on all the rest of
the fingers so now for the penguin
you're going to need a white orange and
black nail polish and the orange i'm
using is peachy keen by China Glaze it's
kind of hard to describe what I'm doing
on the penguin so I think it's best if
you guys just kind of watch and learn
and watch what I'm doing so here I'm
just creating the body and the head and
now I'm creating the little wings
so it should look something like this
now the last thing I'm going to do is
take fairy dust by China Glaze which is
just a sparkly nail polish and I'm going
to apply this on to all of my nails and
as you can see it just gives a very
pretty glistening effect like the snow
and now you're done so I hope you guys
enjoyed my little nail tutorial and this
it kind of turned out a little bit messy
because I was doing it like outside out
and stuff so sorry about that but you
know of course nothing has to be perfect
nothing is ever perfect so yeah I'll see
you guys for another video back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
