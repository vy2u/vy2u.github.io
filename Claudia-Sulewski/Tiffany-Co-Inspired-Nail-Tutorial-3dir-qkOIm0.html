design for you guys and I'm so sorry I
keep making tutorials for you guys but
I'm trying to kind of shove them in
before Christmas so that you know you
girls can recreate these looks before
Christmas time so I'm sorry about that
but today I have a kind of Tiffany
inspired nail design which i think is
really really cute and it's definitely
like my favorite that I've done so far
so on the thumb and pinky you have the
little white ribbons like the cousins
and then on the three middle fingers it
says tea &amp;amp; Co for tiffany &amp;amp; co and of
course it has like that Tiffany color
and then on his head I have nothing
because I'm not a lefty and I wouldn't
be able to do this to save my life on
this hand so keep watching if you guys
want to find out how i created these
nails and promise that my next video
will not be a tutorial yeah i'll see you
guys turn another one bye
so always start out with a base coat I'm
just using this random base and top coat
and I'm just going to apply this on to
all of my nails so next you're going to
have to find some kind of nail polish
that matches the color of the Tiffany
boxes so i'm using this Sophie not nail
polish an appeal for you so now you're
just going to apply this on to all of
your nails
now it's time to create the present on
your thumb so start out by just drawing
a horizontal line down the middle of
your nail and then crossing it over with
a vertical line then you're going to add
the ends of the ribbon and also loops at
the top to create that present / ribbon
effect once you're done with that just
to repeat the same exact steps on your
pinky so now once you're finished you're
going to have to work on your three
middle fingers and we're going to try to
recreate the typing on the Tiffany boxes
so using a black nail polish I'm just
going to start drawing the letters on my
nails so first I'm starting out with the
tea and then in the middle i'm going to
make it and sign and on my index finger
i'm going to make the co sign so i'm
going to write a seat in a no in a
period and remember this does not have
to be perfect at all and it kind of
takes a lot of patience to draw on these
letters but the end result is amazing so
it's definitely worth it once you don't
that just apply on a topcoat and you're
done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
