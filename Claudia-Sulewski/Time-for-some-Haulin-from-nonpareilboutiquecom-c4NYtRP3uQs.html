be doing kind of a review slash haul for
you guys
and I'm really excited about it so
basically I just want to introduce all
of you to a website that I recently
found that I was very impressed with and
I'm just going to show you a couple of
things that I got from their website and
it's kind of like review them and stuff
for you guys so basically I'm just going
to talk a little bit about the website
itself and I'm not sure if I'm
pronouncing this right so sorry if I did
not process right but the website is
nonpareil boutique's calm i'll have like
the little words like right here I'm
sorry if I didn't know how to pronounce
that you guys know I kind of suck at
that but yeah so that's the website and
basically it's just kind of like a
website that sells a bunch of different
makeup brands for like a discounted
price which is really amazing because
you know a lot of people like down
because of the economy and stuff so it's
great to save money on you know makeup
that you want to get so for example some
companies and brands that they sell are
like and my axe elf which I was really
happy about because those are like two
really really famous companies and also
they have some steel products and
Sephora stuff like that I mean you can
check out their website I'll have
everything in the downbar I'll have
every single product I will link like
the page to actually buy that exact
product in there too
as well as like the website itself so
basically I just think it's really great
because you know you're buying makeup
for a discounted price and it they kind
of this show like the original price and
then the price that you're paying for
and it's really crazy because sometimes
you save like a lot of money on
difference like week of items stuff like
that I'm so I'm gonna get right into
this just because I don't want to make
this video is super long or whatever so
the first thing that I got was and I
opened everything because I
yesterday and I got like a variety of
brands you know to spice it up a bit so
first off I got a Wet n Wild mega eyes
cream eyeliner so here's like a little
box it came in and here's the eyeliner
itself it comes in like this little like
clear ball type of thing I don't know oh
and by the way my nails are like
horrible today and I'm writing on my
hand I'm sorry but yeah I couldn't find
any nail polish remover and the bunny
wouldn't come off and I kind of need
this so yeah sorry about that okay so I
was really excited to get this cream
eyeliner because the only gel eyeliner
that I've ever gotten was from Coastal
Scents and to be honest like it's very
dry and I can't really do that like
precise aligning with it and it like
crumbles a little which you know I don't
really like it all and this one is like
the complete opposite of that it's like
very rich pigmented and creamy so I was
really excited about that and it comes
with the brush too but let me show you
guys the actual product I like swatched
a little bit of it at the side so you
guys can't really see cuz I didn't
really want to get any of the middle but
it looks like that
and then also it comes with a brush and
I'm like very very impressed with um I'm
sorry the brush that it comes with let
me just show you guys this is the brush
that I got from Coastal Scents that I
would use everyday
well not everyday but whenever I wore
eyeliner in the upper lash line and as
you can tell it's kind of dull and I
can't do that precise of lighting fit
now let me compare these two brushes
okay so obviously you can tell that the
wet and wild one is like half the size
of the other one like it's um it's
longer as you can tell like that but
it's a lot thinner so I'm definitely
going to be using this one more often
and I actually used it yesterday and
it's super great and the thing about
this is that this eyeliner seriously
does not come off so a couple minutes
ago I made a swatch on my hand right
here let me show you guys
like I'm legit rubbing my hand and it
didn't move at all so that is like super
impressive like I'm scrubbing my hand on
a hand and it's not moving whatsoever so
I think that's really really impressive
and I'm super excited about this and
it's obviously gonna you know stay on
your eyes all day and it's super great
so good things to invest in so that was
the eyeliner another thing that I got
was kind of like related to eyeliner and
stuff and it is the Jessie's Girl eyes
shadow transformer and here is the
little box if you want to know how it
came in look here's the actual pots
itself so it looks like this it has two
ends and basically what you do is you
can take turn any eyeshadow into an
eyeliner so for example if you wanted to
wear like some sparkly light blue
eyeliner one day then you can just use
this and use like an eye shadow you
don't have to actually go out and buy
some kind of eyeliner that you're not
going to use all the time
so I think and eyeshadow transformer is
a great thing to always have on your
hands for like Halloween or any time you
just want to have something different
you can even use black eyeshadow and
just turn into eyeliner also I think
it's really great about this as it has
two ends so it has a wide line end so
let me show you guys so as you can tell
it's it's not too thick but you know
it's pretty thick and then they have
like a fine line end and it looks like
that and it's like super tiny if you
guys can see that
so yeah this thing I'm really really
happy about and I'm very excited to use
it because I just got these stuff
yesterday so I'm definitely gonna fool
around with this I think this is really
cool and I'm going to have all the
prices like down here and stuff like
cuz I don't know them off the top of my
head but the next thing that I got and
this was like a nail art type of thing
and it is the LA Colors Art Deco nail
art you know like nail polish stuff and
it looks like this and I know a lot of
people actually have this stuff and I've
never had one of these before and you
guys know that all I would use is just
like toothpicks for my nails tutorials
and the brushes are whoops I don't want
to spill the brushes are super tiny so I
really like this I was actually like
fooling around on it on my horrible
nails which I don't want to show you
guys but you know these things are
really great so I just decided to get a
white one because you can do a bunch of
stuff with you know white nail polish so
I got that and I really like it of
course I'll have the prices in the
bottom of somewhere so then I got two
Stila products and first off they're
both like little duo shadows yes sorry
about that
so the first one that I got and they
come in this little like cardboard
packaging or whatever and you get it
like this and I'm pretty sure you can
fill it in ten or whatever but I'm just
gonna keep it in this little thing right
here and this is an B color so long I
really don't know but there it is and
the colors are so beautiful I decided to
choose like more natural colors so I can
wear them you know on an everyday basis
so these are the two colors you can get
and the lighter one is super sparkly as
you can tell and it's just like a peachy
champagne nice sparkly skin colored
eyeshadow which is really pretty and of
course these are super pigmented so
that's how it looks and then also you
get this like copper II kind of like
rusty brownie type of eyeshadow so be
great to have this on the lid and like
this on the crease and you can also
highlight with this one
which is what I like so that is the
first little eyeshadow duo they've got
the next one is in Mara Simba looks like
that and these are the eye shadows and I
love these personally I like these
butters just cuz I like more like cold
tone Browns cuz those were kind of like
warmer so you get like a champagne E
like almost like I don't know why I
think of like olive like the color olive
like it's kind of green downed in my
opinion it looks like that so you get
that one and you could put that on the
lid and then you have this darker brown
one hold on I'm running out of fingers
here it looks like that sorry the
swatches were kind of bad but yeah so
I'm super hang-up those and these are a
lot more inexpensive on the website then
X deal itself so I was really happy
about that that was really cool so the
next things I got were from ELF because
I've never ever even tried out for
myself which is pretty crazy so I got a
couple things I was really happy about
so the first thing I got was was the elf
powder brush and it's from the studio
line it just comes with a little bag
thing and here's the brush itself and
basically just use this for your
everyday powder what I really like about
it is that it's flat-topped and it's
really really soft and I used it today
and I really liked it
so it says Oh looks like that and I
dropped it of course so yeah I really
like these brushes they're super
inexpensive and you know they're great
things when you're starting out makeup
or even me who is you know growing their
collections so I like that next up I got
an eyebrow kit from ELF and here's the
little box I don't know why I show you
guys the boxes name you're wondering but
it looks like this
sadness is also from like studio line or
whatever you know it looks like this so
you got a mirror good see my camera and
then you get two colors and the darker
one is actually like like a jelly like
what substance or whatever like creamy
yeah that's what I meant to say and then
the lighter one is a powder and then it
comes with this little applicator which
has a little brush and little angled
brush so yeah and I'm in lights because
obviously I got like I have light
eyebrows so yeah and then next up I got
a little blush the mouth and this is in
tickled pink and it's just a very pretty
light baby pink which is what I really
like and you guys can tell that I used
it today because there's like powder all
over it maybe I could squash this for
you guys okay you can't see that this
lighting is horrible all I'm using is
like one little lamp and it's dark
outside so that's how it looks and of
course comes with a mirror so I love
that so last few things I got were at
lip products and first off I got the
hyper shine lip gloss and this is just
like from the regular um lying so it
looks like this and I drop it again how
many things am I gonna drop in this
video anyways so this is how it looks
and this is in the color fairy which is
what I really like because it's like a
very baby neutral light pink so I'm
really happy about this and I've been
wearing it today and then it has like a
little twisty thingamajig okay yeah so
love that and then the last thing I got
was pretty similar but this was a
luscious liquid lipstick which I was
really wanting to try cuz it's like a
liquid lipstick I don't know and it
looks like this and this is in Baby Lips
once again it's like a lighter pink
because I like lighter lips on me I
don't really like how dark lips look on
me and um it has like that kind of app
applicator so it looks like that once
again it's another one of those like
twisties
yes so that is it for today's haul such
review tip thing whatever but I'll have
the link to everything in the downbar so
just check it out so yeah overall I just
love this website and I encourage you
