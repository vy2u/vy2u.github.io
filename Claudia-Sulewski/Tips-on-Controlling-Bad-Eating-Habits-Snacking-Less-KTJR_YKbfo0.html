my hair is kind of wet messy so I'm
sorry about that but I'm really excited
for today's video but before I get into
it I just want to make a quick
disclaimer I'm not in any way some sort
of health or food specialists I'm just a
regular teenage girl coming to you guys
with advice and just tips that I've
tried for myself and that they've worked
for me
today's video it's not going to be me
telling you guys what you can or can't
eat this is just me telling you guys
little tips and tricks that I've done to
kind of help um take away my bad eating
habits because I'm definitely good to
have a person that would eat for taste
and not because I'm hungry and I would
snack way too often
I love snacking so these are just kind
of tips to help you control your bed
eating habits also this isn't some sort
of diet or anything like that to starve
yourself this is simply just some little
tips that I have done to help me not
snack as much I have ten different
things to talk about and I have them
written down on a little note card so
I'm gonna be rained down but yeah let's
just get right into it so the first one
is when you feel hungry first drink
water because a lot of times when you
think you're hungry you're really just
thirsty so before you think about eating
something try drinking water beforehand
because a lot of the times you're really
just thirsty
so the next one is to limit your snacks
which I know is really hard because at
least from my personal experience I love
to watch TVs and Netflix in the basement
and what I'll do is just grab a big bag
of like chips or goldfish or Oreos or
something I'll just bring the entire
thing down and just eat it as much as I
want and by the time I'm done watching
TV it's all empty and I've eaten it all
so to help kind of limit your snacks and
control how much you're eating what I
recommend doing is find some sort of
bowl or cup or a little container or
something that you can use and fill that
up with whatever goldfish let's say
you're
fill that up with a goldfish and then
put the thing away into the cabinet and
then go watch TV and eat out of the bowl
this will help kind of control how much
you eat because when you have the entire
bag in front of you just gonna keep on
eating and then you're not gonna realize
that you ate it all so when you eat it
out of a bowl you're kind of limiting
yourself and I know at least for me I
would probably be too lazy to go up and
refill it so I just be done once I
finish the bowl that's kind of one of
the ways that I help limit myself to
eating as much and not realizing it my
third tip for you guys is to eat gum
because a lot of the times people eat
just for the taste just because you love
having you know taste in your mouth so
next time you're having cravings and you
feel like eating something instead of
eating a snack you should try chewing
gum because obviously gum only has like
what like 1 to 5 calories in a piece so
it'll satisfy your taste buds and also
save you from eating all those calories
my next tip is to change up your routine
and by that I mean your daily routine
what you do when you come home from
after school or just kind of what you're
doing during the summer because you know
it's summertime now but um during the
school year I had kind of a daily
routine I would come home from school I
would sit down watch like an episode of
Gossip Girl or something and I would
usually snack and when you're doing that
everyday your body just gets used to
eating at that time so every time after
school when you sit down to watch Gossip
Girl or whatever you're watching or even
if you're doing something else
you're going to be like hungry during
that time because your body is just so
used to it but when you change it up for
example what I would do is normally I do
my homework really late at night but
when you come home and do your homework
right away and then you do something
else go outside hang out with your
friends you won't think about eating
because you're not like sitting in front
of the TV and thinking oh I need a snack
because this is what I do you know your
body just gets used to that so when you
change it up and do different things you
don't think about food as much and your
body doesn't your body's just not used
to like changing up your routine so it
won't think about eating if you guys
don't
saying if that doesn't make any sense I
mean it works for me changing up my
routine sometimes it won't work for
people you'll just be hungry at that
time when I change up routines it messes
with my appetite and it'll make me not
want to you know snack during those
periods of times that normally would my
next piece of advice is to tell your
friends and family whether you're just
you just want to start eating healthier
or you want to start snacking less or
whatever it is it's great to tell
everyone around you about what you're
doing a lot of the times you just want
to give up and you know eat a cookie or
something but when you're when you're
with your family and friends they can
stop you and remind you and be like hey
remember you're supposed to be eating
healthier it helps to keep you motivated
as well because they're constantly going
to be on your side and just reminding
you about it my next tip is to try to
count your calories and there are a
bunch of apps for all of you iPhone iPod
users there's actually a lot of websites
- there's my Fitness Pal lose it and a
couple others I don't really remember
but I used to count my calories I
honestly it takes a lot of effort to put
in what you eat every single day but I
did manage to do it for like an entire
week straight this one period of time
and I'm not saying you should count your
calories for the rest of your life
because it takes up so much time and
honestly just gets kind of annoying but
it's really fun to try it out because
when you do count your calories and do
try out like those apps and stuff it
kind of educates you on how much you
should be taking because a lot of them
like you have to put in your weight and
then it tells you how much it was eating
so it kind of helps you learn more about
how calories work how much you know a
certain food item is worth and that kind
of stuff so I think it definitely kind
of helps open up your eyes and see
really how much you should be eating
during the day my next tip is for those
meals when you are using a spoon or a
fork so let's say you're eating cereal
normally what a lot of people do is you
know you dip it in the cereal whatever
and you put in your mouth and then as
you're chewing you prepare another
spoonful cereal and you just keep on
going the faster you eat the more you
will probably end up eating
because you're not giving your stomach
enough time to tell you that you know
you're hungry like I mean you're full
stop eating so it's better to eat slow
because then your stomach has more time
to kind of alert you that you're not
really hungry anymore
and when you're constantly just
preparing for the next bite you're just
going faster and faster so what I
recommend is after eating a bite of
something or spoon or something put the
utensil down and when you put it down it
will give you time to chew and like you
know slowly kind of eat the food and
then pick it up again you know do it
whatever put it back on the table and it
helps kind of slow down the process of
eBay so you know your stomach can alert
you when you're not hungry anymore when
you try this out it might be kind of
annoying because it's a very slow
process but it's really great for
slowing down when you eat because eating
quick will most likely result in eating
a lot more my next tip is very simple
and obvious but it's two more and eat
less the more you chew your food the
more kind of your tricking your mind is
and you're eating more because if you're
just taking huge like gulps of a food
and you barely chew it you just swallow
it down you keep on eating your brain
like you just feel like you're eating
less you know what I mean because when
you're chewing more you kind of feel
like you're working harder to chew your
food and it ends up feeling is like as
if you're eating more food so try to
chew more and eat less the next step is
for when you're going out to eat for
example like a restaurant I've heard
many people say this before but it
honestly is such a good piece of advice
and I definitely recommend it a lot of
the times when restaurants when you buy
food from restaurants their portions are
huge it's normally a huge plate and you
end up being so full when you finish so
I definitely recommend you split your
food in half eat half of it when you're
there save the half for the next day's
lunch I love doing this because then you
don't have to think about what you have
to eat for lunch the next day because
you're just eating leftovers from the
night before and it's a great way to not
eat like too much at night time
and you're saving a lot of calories and
yeah overall it's just really good so
you should try it out
so my last piece of advice and this is
super important this is like one of the
number one things that people always
mess up it and it is to never completely
take out sweets because I have a sweet
tooth and I eat snacks and chips and
sweet food all the time
never ever completely take it out of
your diet or food plan or anything like
that
so let's say you've been eating super
healthy for two weeks and you've just
completely flipped and switched over
your daily eating routine I guess that
will most likely make your cravings go
insane because this happens to me all
the time
I'll eat super healthy cut out any
sweets that I ever eat I mean if you on
if if you normally don't eat sweets then
you shouldn't be listening to this but
for those people that do eat a lot of
sweets and junk food if you just
completely cut it out instantly within
like a day and then you just don't eat
it for weeks and weeks your cravings are
just going to mess with you so much and
at one point you're just gonna crash it
happens to me all the time I'll go to
someone's birthday party and I'll see
junk food and sweets all over just set
out on a table and my cravings will just
be so like insane because I haven't
eaten junk food or sweets in such a long
time that I'll just crash and eat a
bunch of it and it will ruin everything
so what I'm saying is do not cut out
junk food and sweets out of your diet
just make the portions smaller so I hope

hope that you guys try out some of these
tips and tricks that I share with you
guys today and I just want to mention
whoa okay um I did not like make up any
of these I have googled and researched a
lot and I've tried many different things
and these are just the ones that helped
that helped me out the most so that's
why I want to share them with you guys

worked out for me and that I personally
like doing the most I guess so I hope
