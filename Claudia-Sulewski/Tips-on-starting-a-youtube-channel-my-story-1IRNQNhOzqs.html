gonna be really like a tutorial or
anything it's gonna be more of like an
advice video just me talking to you guys
because I think I haven't done this in a
while on this channel so probably one of
my mainly and like most asked questions
when you guys you know send me emails
and personal messages it's probably
Claudia I wanna start a YouTube channel
do you have any tips on like how to get
more subscribers and like what video
should I make up should I start out like
I'm nervous or whatever so I'm just
gonna be talking every about like all
that kind of stuff
in today's video so first off there's
always the most like important stuff
well actually no I'm gonna get to the
first video so a lot of people ask
Claudia what kind of videos I make as my
first one I honestly don't really think
it matters whatever video you put up
first the first video that I ever put up
was like a tutorial on like this blue
like eyeshadow love that was like
seriously only using like two eyeshadows
and then my second one was like a review
or something so I don't think it really
matters in what you put you can always
do like a more popular video for example
like what's my purse or what else a room
tour or something I don't know like one
of those popular tags and if you want to
get you know try to get some views onto
that video you can also request it as a
video response to other people's videos
and make sure to keep a lot of tags on
all of your videos because the more tags
you have on your videos relating to the
topic that the video is about the more
that people will you know discover you
and find out about your videos so
honestly I don't think it really matters
what's your first video just as long as
you can stay like
dear videos you know at least once a
week that I think you'll be fine and
then of course there's always those main
just things that everyone always says
about you know getting started on
YouTube make sure that you have a good
quality camera even like your eye sight
on your MacBook or like on your laptop
or something is still fine just make
sure that because I feel like the better
quality your camera is and the more
comfortable your audience will be like
looking at you because if you're all
blurry and stuff and it can't see you
and you're trying to like do a tutorial
they're gonna be like I can't see what's
going on you know so make sure that you
invest in like a pretty good quality
camera like I said I said some ice at
some like my sights some computers are
you know good quality like I use that a
lot for my videos also good lighting
make sure to have really bright lighting
not too dark or not like shining bright
I definitely recommend natural lighting
so setting your camera for your window
is a great idea that's basically what I
do every day like I have no lights on
right now this is all like the sun's
light coming in and I always do that so
I always record my videos like in the
morning or during the day on weekends
and stuff um what else is there also
make sure to speak loudly in your videos
because if they're really quiet and they
can't hear what you're saying they won't
like you know enjoy watching or whatever
so also make sure that you know you can
like pronounce like clearly and talk
clearly don't be like you know I don't
know I mean no one does that but you
know make sure that you talk through you
loudly even like so if they can hear you
and stuff like that and that's just kind
of like the main key points that like
everybody knows about but I just felt
like kind of adding that in there um and
then you know like a lot of people ask
Claudia how do you get so many
subscribers honestly there is no trick
to it I never do suffer sob or anything
like that honestly you just have to be
yourself you know show your true self
through your videos and just the right
like you're true subscribers will
eventually come to you just make sure
don't like try to be someone that you're
not you know what I mean like I don't
know I just I feel like if you're being
fake in your videos and you're not
showing your real self eventually like
people will start realizing that
and I just I think you should just like
be yourself and stuff like that and yeah
that's pretty much like the biggest
thing I mean of course everyone always
says that is to be yourself but it's
honestly true and your subscribers will
come to you so there's really no way to
like get subscribers really fast I mean
obviously I've been doing videos for
like over a year now so you have to have
some time in patience and yeah that's
practically it so also if you're
wondering how to get news like I said
before you can just make video responses
to other videos like I used to do that
when I started out I'm not gonna lie
like for example if I made a what's in
my purse I like video crested I like
juicy sterile sevens you know what's my
first video and that got me a couple
views and kind of more recognized and
stuff like that and yeah that's
basically it but also I want to mention
one more thing is a lot of girls say
that they're scared to do like YouTube
videos about you know people finding out
at school and all that stuff
so first I just wanna warn you guys that
before you make a youtube channel you
have to know like what you're getting
into because people will eventually find
out in your school because if you tell
your friends you know maybe something
will slip out or maybe someone from your
school will somehow like come upon your
videos and people will eventually find
out so a lot of people ask me if people
know in my school and yes they do
actually they found out this school year
and it's basically what happened was I
don't know how but a couple you know
like a group of girls kind of found out
about my YouTube videos and you know
they thought it was kind of like a joke
and they didn't really understand why I
was doing this and you know basically
they thought it'd be funny to kind of
just tell everyone and then guys find
out and then guys told everyone else so
everyone kind of knows and it kind of
stink tat first I'm not gonna lie it was
kind of horrible because everyone at
that point when people were talking
about me my videos they weren't saying
like that I that I help you girls and
stuff like that they'd be like oh she's
making videos learning I put
liner and do crunches you know like they
didn't I don't think anyone really
understood why I'm doing this so that's
why they thought this was like a good
way to like kind of pick on me
so guys kind of would like text me and
be like hey I'm watching your videos and
it's like wow really but I realized over
time the guys kind of forgot about it I
mean they don't really care anymore some
people still like laugh about it or
whatever but the guys don't really like
care that much but some girls still do
like make fun of me for it like
obviously not to my face but I really
don't care like like for example if a
guy goes out with me then those girls
will like tease the guy about it like
it's it's so so so stupid that they do
that and that's so immature and childish
because they have no what they don't
even know like half of it you know so
you just have to I just want to prepare
you guys that you know people will find
out and obviously I mean honestly you
just have to ignore them like when
people come up random people come up to
me in school they're like huh beyond
Beauty star are they like shot in the
hallway and I'm like you're cool you
know I don't really care honestly I
don't care at all so I just want to
share my little story so yes everybody
does know as yeah I mean everything
happens for a reason so I guess I'm kind
of happy that everyone knows because I
don't have to like keep a secret or
anything so yeah and then also for girls
saying that they're scared to do it and
they don't know if they should I
definitely say 100% try it out it's so
much fun
you meet so many new people and I love
like interacting with you guys from
across the world like I get messages
from girls that live in like Australia
and like England and all this cool stuff
and it's really awesome I've had some
great opportunities because of this
YouTube channel and if there's this just
such a blast and I'm so on like I'm so
grateful for everyone that subscribes me
and I honestly don't regret this at all
and I don't know I think it's really fun
and you know it's kind of interesting
it's not like I mean there's not a lot
of people that you know our videos on
YouTube like in my school or anything
like that so I don't I think it's it's
really unique and it's really fun and I
definitely
recommend you guys to do it so much fun
and yeah that's B skip for today's video
so I hope this helped any of you future
gurus out there and maybe my tips kind
of helped you a little bit and I just
want to show you guys my story I'm
starting my own YouTube channel and
stuff like that so I hope you guys
enjoyed today's video and I will talk to
you guys for not that one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
