brilliance and we went shopping today if
we actually are filming two halls
tonight one for her channel one for mine
so today we are going to be hauling our
things from Topshop and Oberon Aspen's
Hall we showed a few of the things that
we got from Urban Outfitters
hmmm madness so I don't have that Hall
and the down bar lately I've had a huge
obsession with boyfriend jeans so I got
a pair from Topshop and they are super
super data games I know they're so cute
though yeah I actually switched these
out during the day because they're so
cute but they're just really baggy
they're cuffed at the bottom and they
have huge rips just a thingy so no it's
all good yeah it's like pretty late so
yeah
don't wash out that I think thank you
yeah they're super light so I don't own
any like really light or jeans so I got
those so the first thing I got is
actually the opposite of light wash
boyfriend Jean you know and it's black
leggings so these are just plain black
leggings but they have some like seams
right here so they look a little bit
more like Taylor Taylor to kind of nicer
I guess they're a little bit high
waisted but they just have a really
stretchy band right here so they're like
really comfortable and soft it's a cute
the next item I got is this leather
skirt right here so it's got like a
quilted pattern to it and it has little
zippered pockets on the sides and a
zipper on the back I thought it was just
like really different for what I you
know normally wear so like that so my
second item is a tank top even though
it's going to be like well I mean it is
fall and it's gonna be like closer but
layering yeah you can like layer with it
so it's just like plain black but it
actually has like a lace kind of floral
print like you can really see because
it's black that's kind of just like a
little bit not fancy but more dressed up
than like a plain black tank top so I
thought it was a cute so I got that B
mixture I got I am so obsessed with it's
very simple but yeah I think it's really
cute so it's just like a very light
that's like dusty pink it's got like a
little bit of gray in it yeah oh so it's
like a light baby pink leather shirt and
I don't you guys can see but it has like
kind of like stitching right here that
gives it a little bit of you know like
shape to it and stuff and I don't know I
thought these the cut of it was really
cute in the style so yeah it's leather
all the way around so then I have
another pair of leggings and these are
actually kind of like jeggings and I
really like the wash of them I don't
have anything that's like this color so
it looks more like jeans cuz it has like
this feeling sitting on the front cuff
the cropped area so I just thought these
were key if there's like little jeggings
and Aspen hates hates jeans
I hate comfortable these when I saw
these I liked like yes this is like the
closest thing from like you wearing
jeans yeah I think you know some but
they're just like so uncomfortable me so
I love jeggings so I thought these are
really cute be nice okay the next
article of clothing I got is definitely
a little out there I would say they're
cool yeah I think they're really cool so
there are these white like you call this
so there are these white texture like
trousers kind of
so they go a little bit tighter at the
bottom the texture of it is like kind of
like royalty
it's like crosshatch yeah we don't know
our turns
I don't know how I explained it you guys
probably can't see it but yeah so it's
like a little bit bad here at the top
and then it kind of like goes yeah and
it just has pockets on the front and
back and you know I thought these were
very just cool like fancy pants that you
have a believe your pants that wrenches
yeah it's very like sophisticated fancy
that you can wear with like black keels
or something don't know where I'm gonna
wear these yet but you will figure that
later so and these are on sale so you
know yeah like why not wanna so the next
thing I got is actually really similar
to the other tank top I showed but this
is just like a plain one so it's kind of
just like a dressy looking tank top that
can like you layered with different
kinds of sweaters or whatever you want
to like layer it with but it just like a
little bit more sophisticated looking so
just like plain black and it's not for
Lee or anything like the other one so
which is like a simple black tank top
yeah kind of like one of those just must
have like essentials yes yeah I think
that's shirt I got it's like a very it's
like a tunic kind of because it's really
long so it's like a quarter length
sleeve like Brittany yeah it's got like
this texture to it really soft it kind
of looks like crocodile do you see that
yeah it's like crocodile looking but
it's like me that is like fabric
yeah so it's really soft so I thought
that was kind of interesting and this is
actually long enough on me to have to
wear as like a short dress so what I
plan on doing is wearing like cheer
types with over-the-knee black boots
what you like sales drawing so I think
that would look really cute with this
shirt the dress whatever it is so the
last thing that I have is this dress and
I really like this style of this dress
and I think the pattern is also really
cute and I don't really
like with this pattern on it because
it's not common so I wanted to get this
and I really like it wasn't that
expensive so I just I'm excited to wear
this you can wear with like tights or
something because it's probably gonna be
cold the next clothing item that I got
looks like this so it's like the same
exact sure that you got except in like
silk this plummy color yeah it's like
silky feeling and it was like chiffon
yeah yeah and yeah that's like a really
pretty Clemmy color so pretty I thought
it was really cute for like the winter
time and then lastly I just got two of
jewelry pieces so the first thing I got
was this necklace and it's very like
interesting and different so it's black
it's matte black and it just has like
different it's like a watch yeah it
looks like a watch it's like certain
parts but then it's like bigger pieces
at the bottom
Wow I'm an awful describer of this
necklace but I just thought it looks
really cool and I think that this would
look really good on the baby pink like
leather shirt yeah or something so I
think that would look really good and
then lastly I got these rings which they
were actually right by the cash cash
they always suck you into buying stuff
everything's got by the register and
these are just a bunch of different like
committee rings yeah I really love MIDI
rings and just wearing a bunch of rings
and stuff so that is everything that we
bought from Topshop today yeah if you

hauling that we did today that will be
