video I wanted to create a tropical
inspired nail tutorial for you guys
before applying on any nail polish
always be sure to apply on some base
coats the first nail polish that I'm
going to be using is a bright yellow
nail polish from OPI and I'm just going
to apply this onto my ring finger and
thumb to achieve an even coat with this
nail polish I'm applying on two layers
using a pastel green nail polish from
Zoe I'm going to apply this on the rest
of my nails I applied on two layers with
this nail polish as well once you're
done with that step your nails should
look a little something like this then
after that I'm using a brown nail polish
with a striping brush and I'm going to
create crisscross lines on both of my
yellow fingernails this is going to
represent the pineapples yum and don't
worry if your nails are not perfect
because now I'm going to be using a dark
green nail polish and with a dotting
tool I'm just going to draw some leaves
on the top corner of both my pineapple
nails here is a fun fact that I bet a
lot of you guys do know but it actually
takes almost three years for a single
pineapple to fully mature and develop
yeah that's a long time
now going back in with that dark green
nail polish that we've been using and
the striper brush I'm going to create
some palm tree leaves on the rest of my
nails and you can do this easily by
drawing one line and then drawing little
lines coming from the outside like an
upside down Christmas tree and that is
when my studio light fell on top of me
so I was lying on the ground and tada
that is how the nails turned out always
be sure to apply on some so wait no
we're not done yet
now I'm gonna go back in with the pastel
green nail polish and my striper brush
and just create some lines and texture
on the pineapple leaves to give an extra
touch then we go in with the top coat
and apply that on all of our nails and
this will help to make sure that your
design stays for as long as possible and
your nails will not chip and that is it
for today's spring break inspired nail
tutorial I hope you guys enjoyed it and
I will see you guys for a new video very
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
