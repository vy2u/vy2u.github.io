doing it the two truths and one lie tag
which was originally created by Hudson
otherwise known as Dookie Luth here on
YouTube he tagged me to do it and it
seems really really fun so I will have
Hudson's video in the downbar as well as
his channel and if you guys don't know
how this tag works basically there are
five different categories and for each
category I'm going to be giving you guys
two truths and one lie and you guys are
going to have to guess which one is the
lie and of course I'll tell you the
answers like five seconds after I tell
you the truths and a lie
so let's get started the first category
is badass iPad my friend driving me
places while she only had her permit
I've given a boy a bloody nose for
making fun of my YouTube videos and I've
gotten a saturday detention for cheating
this deck is already making me seem so
bad I promise I'm not a horrible person
did you get it got it good okay I
actually have had my friend drive me
places while she only had her permits
and don't worry it was only like two
times to go get like Dairy Queen or
something but it's okay now because we
all have our license so we don't have to
worry about that as intimidating and
tough as I look I actually have never
given a boy a bloody nose for making fun
of my YouTube videos I am NOT a fighter
I don't like to physically hurt people
so that leaves us with the saturday
detention
for cheating and yes that actually did
happen last year for one of my math
tests I wasn't really feeling very
confident in myself going into the test
so I made a little cheat sheet and I
didn't end up using it but I did have it
on me and the teacher saw it so she
caught me but it's all good because she
let me retake the test and I ended up
getting the same exact score as I did
before so I was able to like prove to
her that I didn't use the cheat sheet
but I got to sit in a room for four
hours on a Saturday morning the next
category is music number one I do not
know all of the band members names of
One Direction number two I wake up to
hot and cold by Katy Perry every single
morning for school
and number three I used to be a huge
Slipknot fan so I'll let you guys think
about it for a little bit
I feel like I'm gonna get a lot of hate
for this but I actually do not know all
of the band members names in one
direction like I've recently been
listening to their music and I like it
but I was I've never been like a true
like one Directioner alright so this
this is what I know there's Harry Leigh
Lane what no the UM Zayn Louie's that
one of them and I don't know the fifth
one the second one was also true so I do
wake up to hot and cold by Katy Perry
every single morning I don't know why
when I was changing the settings for my
alarm clock I decided to make it hot and
cold by Katy Perry cuz I figured it was
like a really good upbeat song and now
every single time I hear it I want to
kill myself because I just think of like
waking up at 6 a.m. every morning but
yeah it's true
so that leaves us with the third fact
which is I used to be a huge Slipknot
fan which is not true at all my brother
used to be actually so that's how I know
of them but they are like a death metal
band and I don't like that kind of music
so that one's alive the third category
is secrets my first secret is I own a
diary my second secret is that I used to
have an Instagram where I would only
take pictures of really nice cars that I
would see and it just kind of became a
hobby of mine my third secret is that I
have seen every single episode of h2o
which is a Nickelodeon series about
mermaids so think about it think about
it
so the first secret is actually true
but it's more like a journal and I write
in it probably like once every like four
months so it's not like I'm like sitting
at my desk every night like to your
diary but um I just occasionally like to
write things that are going on just that
I can look at it in the future and just
laugh about how weird I was so yeah the
second secret about me having an
Instagram just for taking pictures of
really nice cars is a lie I have never
done that no not really that into cars
to have an entire Instagram for them but
it's a lie so that leaves us with my
third secret which is I have seen every
single episode of h2o which is
completely true because I was so
obsessed of that show and this is recent
too this was like during the summertime
but I actually got really sad when I
finished watching every single episode
because it was really good so I
recommend it
you guys like shows about mermaids the
fourth category is school so these are
all things that have happened to me in
school or that just has to relate with
school so the first one is last year I
spilled tomato soup in my locker and it
completely destroyed all of my books so
my parents had to repurchase all of them
and they were very upset with me the
second one is in middle school I wrote a
story about a little kid getting shoved
into an oven and I was forced to read it
in front of my entire grade and the last
one is I always complete my homework
I'll give you guys some time to think
about it
so which one do you guys think is the
lie so the story about me dumping tomato
soup in my locker is a complete lie I
just kind of came up with that that
never happened if that did my parents
would definitely make me pay for my own
books so that was the lie that means
that I did write a story about a little
kid getting shoved into an oven in
middle school and no I don't just
randomly write like little horror
stories when I was younger we're
actually having a writing competition
during like the Halloween time once we
all finished our horror stories then
everyone got to read ours and vote for
us as well as the teachers and there
were three winners and I was one of them
so that means that I had to read it in
front of everyone and I also got a huge
chocolate bar so that was really really
awesome the last category is boys or
girls and you're supposed to choose the
opposite sex so obviously I'm going to
choose boys what I'm a girl okay so the
first one is I have never kissed a
ginger the second one is I have been in
a relationship that lasted less than 24
hours the third one is last year I
hooked up with a 22 year old without
knowing that we had such a large age
difference and then we found out
afterwards and I was like well you are
almost the same age as my older brother
that is really creepy and by its that's
I know I can stop talking now
so now I won't give you guys some time
to think about it
so the first one is true so I have never
kissed a ginger before the one about me
being in a relationship that lasted less
than 24 hours is also true so that did
happen but it was like in middle school
so it didn't really like count at all I
don't even know it was like stupidest
thing ever but it happened so that
leaves us with the 22 year old I am
sorry to disappoint you guys but that
never happened
that would be like rape right can you
imagine if that actually happened like
beyond beauty exposed with the 22 year
olds oh my god alright so that is it for
the tag I hope you guys enjoyed it I
will be tagging some people in the
downbar

pictures of really nice cars I could not

at where I would take really pic really
pictures yeah really Claudia I used to
