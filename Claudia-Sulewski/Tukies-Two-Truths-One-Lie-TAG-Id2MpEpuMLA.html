doing it the two truths and one lie tag
which was originally created by Hudson
otherwise known as two key Louth here on
YouTube he tagged me to do it and it
seems really really fun so i will have
Hudson's video in the downbar as well as
his channel if you guys don't know how
this tab works basically there are five
different categories and for each
category I'm going to be giving you guys
two truths and one lie and you guys are
going to have to guess which one is the
lie and of course i'll tell you the
answers like five seconds after i tell
you the truths and a lie so let's get
started the first category is badass
ipad my friend driving me places while
she only had her permit I've given a boy
a bloody nose for making fun of my
youtube videos and I've gotten a
saturday detention for cheating this
deck is already making me seem so bad I
promise I'm not a horrible person
did you get it got it good okay I
actually have had my friend drive me
places while she only had her permits
and don't worry it was only like two
times to go get like dairy queen or
something but it's okay now because we
all have our license so you don't have
to worry about that as intimidating and
tough as I look I actually have never
given a boy a bloody nose for making fun
of my youtube videos I am NOT a fighter
i don't like to physically hurt people
so that leaves us with the saturday
detention for cheating and yes that
actually did happen last year for one of
my math tests i wasn't really feeling
very confident in myself going into the
test so i made a little cheat sheet and
I didn't end up using it but I did have
it on me and the teacher saw it so she
caught me but it's all good because she
let me retake the test and i ended up
getting the same exact score as i did
before so I was able to like prove to
her that I didn't use the cheat sheet
but um I got to send a room for four
hours on a saturday morning the next
category is music number one I do not
know all of the band members names of
one direction number two I wake up too
hot and cold by katy perry every single
morning for school and number three I
used to be a huge Slipknot fan so I'll
let you guys think about it for a little
bit
I feel like I'm gonna get a lot of hate
for this but I actually do not know all
of the band members names in one
direction like I've really been
listening to their music and I like it
but I was I've never been like a true
like one Directioner all right so this
this is what I know there's Harry lay
lane what no Liam Zane um Louise that
one of them and I don't know the fifth
one the second one was also true so I do
wake up too hot and cold by katy perry
every single morning I don't know why
when I was changing the settings for my
alarm clock I decided to make it hot and
cold by katy perry cuz i figured it was
like a really good upbeat song and now
every single time I hear it I want to
kill myself because I just think of like
waking up at six a.m. every morning um
but yeah it's true so that leaves us
with the third fact which is I used to
be a huge Slipknot fan which is not true
at all my brother used to be actually so
that's how I know of them but they are
like a death metal band and I don't like
that kind of music so that one's alive
the third category is secrets my first
secret is I own a diary my second secret
is that I used to have an Instagram
where I would only take pictures of
really nice cars that I would see and it
just kind of became a hobby of mine my
third secret is that I have seen every
single episode of h2o which is a
Nickelodeon series about mermaids so
think about it think about it
so the first secret is actually true but
it it's more like a journal and I write
in it probably like once every like four
months so it's not like I'm like sitting
at my desk every night like to your
diary but um I just occasionally look
like to write things that are going on
just that I can look at it in the future
and just laugh about how weird i was so
yeah the second secret about me having
an Instagram just for taking pictures of
really nice cars is a lie I have never
done that no not really that into cars
to have an entire Instagram for them but
um it's alive so that leaves us with my
third secret which is I have seen every
single episode of h2o which is
completely true because I was so
obsessed of that show and this is recent
to this was like during the summertime
but I actually got really sad when I
finished watching every single episode
because it was really good so I
recommend it you guys like shows about
mermaids the fourth category is school
so these are all things that have
happened to me in school or that just
has to relate with school so the first
one is last year I spilled tomato soup
in my locker and it completely destroyed
all of my books so my parents had to
repurchase all of them and they were
very upset with me the second one is in
middle school I wrote a story about a
little kid getting shoved into an oven
and I was forced to read it in front of
my entire grade and the last one is I
always complete my homework I'll give
you guys some time to think about it
what am I so which one do you guys think
is the lie so the story about me dumping
tomato soup in my locker is a complete
lie i just kind of came up with that
that never happened if that did my
parents would definitely make me pay for
my own books so that was the lie that
means that I did write a story about a
little kid getting shoved into an oven
in middle school and no I don't just
randomly right like little horror
stories when I was younger we're
actually having a writing competition
during like the Halloween time once we
all finished our horror stories than
everyone got to read ours and vote for
us as well as the teachers and there
were three winners and I was one of them
so that means that I had to read it in
front of everyone and I also got a huge
chocolate bar so that was really really
awesome the last category is boys or
girls and you're supposed to choose the
opposite sex so obviously i'm going to
choose boys what I'm a girl okay so the
first one is I have never kissed a
ginger the second one is I have been in
a relationship that lasted less than 24
hours the third one is last year I
hooked up with a 22 year old without
knowing that we had such a large age
difference and then we found out
afterwards and I was like well you are
almost the same age as my older brother
that is really creepy and by its bits I
and I can stop talking out so now I
won't give you guys some time to think
about it
so the first one is true so I have never
kissed a ginger before the one about me
being in a relationship that lasted less
than 24 hours is also true so that did
happen but it was like in middle school
so it didn't really like count at all I
don't even know it was like stupidest
thing ever but it happened so that
leaves us with the 22 year old i am
sorry to disappoint you guys but that
never happened that would be like rape
right can you imagine if that actually
happened like beyond beauty exposed with
a 22 year olds oh my god alright so that
is it for the TAC I hope you guys
enjoyed it I will be tagging some people
in the downbar as well as all of you

someone's like hammering i do not know
all of the band number ban numbers okay
where I would take pictures of really
nice cars I could not do this okay I
used to have an Instagram where I would
take really pick really pictures yeah

say this one looks like I'm breaking out
into like hives right here does anyone
else notice that mm-hmm
