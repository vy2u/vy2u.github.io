guys how to make your nails look like as
if they've been melted so prior to this
video you want to make sure to clip and
file your nails as short as possible
just to give the best effect for this
look so first I'm going to start up with
grabbing a white nail polish and I'm
just going to very roughly kind of
sketch the design online now to see
where I kind of want the you know crack
to kind of be so now for the blood part
i'm going to be using four different
nail polishes i'm going to be using a
bright red a dark red and even more dark
red and lastly a black nail polish so
then starting with the lightest color in
the middle you're just going to make
your way outwards and just kind of go
darker as you go
now to make this look a little bit more
realistic and a little bit more texture
than just grab your tool and just kind
of make dots everywhere and mix the
colors to kind of blend it all together
now FYI you're probably gonna get a lot
of nail polish all over your skin just
like I did but no worries you can easily
just wipe it off with some nail polish
remover at the end so yeah so now you're
just going to let that dry so after that
you want to grab a nude nail polish I'm
using this one from sally hansen and
this part is really cool okay so what
you do is you just kind of very muscley
apply it to the other half of your nail
that hasn't been painted already this
doesn't have to be perfect at all just
make sure it's very thick and now you're
going to let this dry like halfway
through so it's not completely dry but
it's still not watery so it's kind of
like tacky and then you're going to grab
a q-tip that is dipped in nail polish
remover it has to be dipped in nail
polish remover for this to work and
you're just going to push the nail
polish to kind of where the blood and
the nail kind of meats and this is going
to give a really cool effect on your
nails and i'm just going to fix this up
a bit with a toothpick and some more of
the nail polish we're doing this because
it kind of gives illusion of the melted
nail and also since it is popping out
and it gives a little bit more dimension
it's going to kind of put a twist on any
other you no ordinary nail polish
tutorial so once you've done with that
you want to make the look a little bit
more you know bruised and damaged so I'm
going to grab a purple and a yellow nail
polish yes purple yellow and you're
going to apply this on the other side of
like the melted skin part and basically
I'm just put applying the purple first
and then after that I'm just blending in
some yellow and this will kind of give
your nail a more like bruised up type of
look and don't worry I'm going to put
nail polish over it obviously because
that kind of looks retarded um so now
you're just going to grab the nude nail
polish that use before and just very
very
lightly apply it over so you can still
kind of see the purple and yellow but
not quite so yeah just do that once
you're done with that you're just going
to let it dry and then you're just going
to apply on some topcoat only on to it
being male side just because if you
apply it over the blood and then you're
going to lose that texture that you
created so once that dress you are
completely done
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
