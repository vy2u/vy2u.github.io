wearing kind of very soft and wavy curls
and I've been getting so many requests
on how I create that hair tutorial so
that's what I'm going to be doing today
so I actually like this hair tutorial a
lot just because it only takes like 10
minutes to do and it looks super cute
and kind of very soft and natural
looking so that's why I like it a lot
I've actually been wearing this like
three time three days in a week
like before school I actually wear this
look to school that's how fast it is so
yeah first we're just gonna start out by
showing you guys what you need for
today's hair tutorial so first off of
course need a brush and I like using a
paddle brush for this also you're going
to need some kind of heat protectant I
definitely recommend either the Tresemme
one or this one from kqc it's their
thermal shine heat protectant and I love
this stuff so much it sprays out like a
hair spray so it's kind of cool and then
the last thing you need is a hair
straightener yes we're gonna be curling
your hair with a hair straightener today
I like using a hair straightener instead
of a curler just because I think it's a
lot faster so it kind of contributes
towards making this hair tutorial like a
10 minute tutorial so yeah today I'm
going to be using the kqc professional
ceramic X heat flatiron I'm obsessed
with this I got it from Flatiron experts
calm I'll have their link their website
link in the downbar and I will as well
have the direct link to this hair
straightener just in case if you want to
also invest in it and I love it so so so
so much it's so good oh my goodness I've
been using it like every day and I just
love it so yeah that's all you need for
today's hairstyle and if you want to
figure out how to do this then keep
watching it's not really just gonna be
me here curling my all my hair with the
straightener because I'm sure you guys
have seen a bunch of videos of that but
it's kind of more like the way that I
curl the hair in the back the way that I
curl my hair in the front so I've kind
of like
tweak'd it up and kind of made the
technique a little bit different just so
that it looks a little bit more natural
as well as making it a lot more faster
to do so before I actually tell you guys
about the way that I like to comb my
hair for this tutorial I'm just going to
quickly teach you guys how to actually
curl your hair to the straightener and
I'm sure that a bunch of you already
know how to do that but I'm also sure
that some of you don't know how to do
that so before I actually get into it I
just quickly want to run over and kind
of show you guys how to actually curl
your hair with the straightener so keep
watching if you want to figure that out
and then we'll actually get into the
hair tutorial so starting off with the
hair on the right side of your head what
you want to do is place the straightener
like you would as if you're
straightening your hair then grab that
chunk of hair at the bottom pull it
behind the straightener and then once
you drop it you're gonna rotate your
straightener like 360 degrees I guess
you can say or two times so that the
chunk is kind of hanging out from the
straightener and then all you're gonna
do is slowly just move it down your hair
very slowly try not to stop too much and
the faster you go the looser the curls
will be and then once you do that just
use your fingers and just kind of twirl
a curl around to give it that shape so
here's a clip of just me doing it again
so now for the hair on the left side of
your head you're gonna do the same thing
except the opposite so instead of
putting the hair behind you're gonna put
it over and then you're gonna turn the
straightener towards you 360 degrees
then you're just going to slowly move
this straightener down towards the
bottom of your hair
so here's another clip of me just
showing you guys how I did the left side
of the head
okay so now that you actually know how
to curl your hair at the straightener
you are ready to actually work on it so
the first thing you want to do is just
brush out your hair of course so the
technique that I like doing for this
hair tutorial is all the pieces in the
front I'm gonna be curling from like top
not all into the top but kind of like
right here to the bottom so all the
front pieces I'm basically going to be
curling all of it but as I go to the
back I'm gonna start lower and lower so
once it gets to the bottom pieces I
probably curl from here to the bottom so
that's kind of what's different about
today's hair tutorial so it's really
like face framing on the front and then
as you go the back it kind of like the
curls kind of get lower and lower so
that's kind of what makes this hair 212
really cute natural-looking and as well
a lot faster because you don't actually
have to curl all of you know your hair
in the back just kind of like a little
bit like the tips so that's what kind of
makes it like an everyday kind of look
that only takes ten minutes so I'm just
gonna start out by grabbing my heat
protectant and just kind of spraying it
through my hair make sure you get your
ends that's like the most important part
then of course just brush it out to kind
of distribute that throughout your hair
okay so since my hair is really really
like thin and I don't have a lot of it I
don't have to divide my hair as much as
maybe some people do so all I have to do
is just divide my hair in half on both
sides and that works best for me but if
you have thicker hair you can like start
by putting half of it up and then do the
bottom and then take it down but I don't
have to do that because I have really
really thin hair okay so first we're
just going to start with the front
pieces and curl them all the way from
the roots to the bottom so just like
that so I'm just gonna take another
piece and just do that you want to make
sure that you go really slow and nicely
you don't want to like stop a bunch of
times to get random kinks in your hair
so you're just gonna keep doing this
with the front pieces of
here
okay so I curled all my front pieces as
you can see now I'm going to grab the
paddle brush and I'm just gonna brush
them out to make them look a lot more
softer and natural so now we're gonna be
working on the back pieces so I'm
actually going to throw this hair back
just to kind of keep it more organized
so I'm just going to grab a piece and
I'm going to start like halfway this
time
once again I'm just gonna start really
low
now quick tip for all those people that
don't have naturally straight hair since
you aren't going to be touching your
hair up here if you do have curly hair
then you can just quickly straighten it
and then curl the bottoms
you
you don't have to be really really
perfect to this hair tutorial because
it's just supposed to look very very
natural and soft as you can see I'm not
taking like perfect little pieces either
I'm just kind of grabbing random hair
and just curling it
okay so I'm officially done on this side
now you're just gonna brush it out and
as you can see it's just very kind of
soft and bouncy and cute and its really
like pretty and then back and stuff all
right so to save some time I'm just
gonna quickly turn off the camera and
curl this half of the hair and then I'll
just get back to you guys once I'm done
I've officially Dawn's my hair and it
was super super easy and fast to do and
as you can see that curls kind of go
down more I'm just gonna show you guys
the back because the back looks very
pretty it falls it's a really pretty
kind of curls so I'm just kind of
obsessed with how the hair looks in the
back I don't know why if your hair
doesn't really hold curls very well then
of course you could just spray some
hairspray on it but for some reason when
I curl my hair of the straightener it
kind of holds and lasts for the entire
day so I don't have to put any hairspray
on but of course if you need to then you
can do that but other than that you are
finished so I hope you guys enjoy this
video and I'll talk to you guys later
bye
