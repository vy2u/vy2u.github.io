from modis calm and I'm patting it all
over my entire lid make sure you blend
it out towards the top
now for the eyeshadow I'm using two
little Lancome quads so that you guys
aren't confused this will be quad number
one and this will be number two so
taking a flat shader brush and quad
number one you're going to take the
light champagne II I shadow and patting
it all over your entire lid
using quad number 2 i'm going to take
the shimmery light brown eyeshadow with
the same brush and I'm just going to Pat
it into the crease this will be our base
color for the all the other crease
colors that we're going to be using
using my SS 217 brush I'm just going to
go ahead and blend out the two colors
going back to the first pallet I'm going
to take the same brush that will use
from the beginning and I'm describing
the chocolatey brown eyeshadow and I'm
gonna Pat that into my crease don't
forget to blend out your columns using
pallet number 1 i'm going to choose the
pinkish red eyeshadow and i'm going to
apply it into my crease the reason that
i'm using this eyeshadow is to overall
give a more warm effect on the eye
makeup look so just apply that in your
outer V and go ahead and blend away you
can add more eyeshadow if necessary
now I'm going to use a small pencil
brush and I'm going to take the same
exact I shadow and just bring it down to
the outer half of my lower lashline so
now taking pout number 2 i'm going to
choose the lightest shade and i'm going
to apply that into the inner corner of
my eyes drag the color out to your brow
bone the colors are picking up too well
in the lighting of this video but trust
me guys in real life it is a lot more
vibrant so on to eyeliner and mascara
take your favorite black gel eyeliner
and you're gonna apply it on to your
upper lash line I'm only making a very
thin line just to give a little bit more
volume to my lashes so don't make it too
thick
now taking the jaw eyeliner once again
you're going to apply it to the second
half of your waterline and i'm using the
juicystar 07 trick where you take a
black eyeshadow and Pat it on your
waterline this will help your eyeliner
stay on for the entire day so now I'm
just going to quickly curl my lashes so
now just choose your favorite mascara
and coat your lashes however many times
you want and for your lower lashes only
coat the ones on the second outer half
of your eyes so onto the lips start out
with any lipstick or lip balm that you
prefer i'm using the lip balm from bos
the lipstick that i'm using is boiling
points by lancome and it seems i could
be really dark but it's actually very
sheer and it just gives very nice very
look to my lips and now you're done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
