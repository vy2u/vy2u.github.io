coat i'm using Sandy's toughen up base
coat and you want to apply that evenly
onto your nail
make sure you let your nail dry now grab
any yellow gold or even orange nail
polish that you have I'm going to be
using one yellow nail polish and two
golds colored nail polishes so first I'm
going to start out with the yellow nail
polish I'm going to apply this evenly
onto my now now I really like using this
nail polish because it's very sheer so
it gives a very nice and yellow sparkly
undertone to my nail make sure you let
that dry so now grab your other colors
and start applying that onto your nail
now I'm just drawing random spots all
over my nail you want to make sure that
you do not do this perfectly because
every tiger is not perfect so I'm just
drawing it all over randomly onto my
nail you can do stripes or even polka
dots so now I'm going to grab my second
color and in my case it's a sparkly gold
and I'm going to apply that on to the
areas that maybe I want a little bit
more gold make sure every nail is unique
and different from each other don't
forget to let your nails dry
so now it's time for the stripes grab
any hard surface a toothpick and of
course black nail polish to achieve the
look start out by dabbing it onto any
hard surface and grab your toothpick and
dip it into the nail polish now in order
to create the tiger stripes there's
really no special technique but what I
like to do is start out by drawing a
thick line on the outer edge of your
nail and as you're making your way
inwards start making the line a little
bit thinner gradually and also you can
start waving it around from side to side
making it a curly line so you want to
repeat this step all over your entire
nail
give your nails a couple minutes to dry
then finish off with a top coat i'm
using Sandy's super shiny top coat and
I'm going to evenly apply that on to all
of my nails
you are now finished with the look good
luck
hey
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
