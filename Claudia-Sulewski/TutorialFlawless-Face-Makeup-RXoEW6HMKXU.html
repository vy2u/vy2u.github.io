today's video because I'm going to be
starting a little video series here on
my channel so throughout this season I'm
going to be at periodically uploading
videos showing you guys how to recreate
different fashion trends and makeup
trends that I saw on the runway of 2013
I'm partnering with Maybelline to
present these videos with you guys so I
just wanted to thank them but if any of
you guys recreate any of the looks that
I will be recreating from the runway
then make sure to tweet them to me or
Instagram them to me I'll have all the
links in the downbar and I'll also like
all the other girls that went to Fashion
Week with me because they are also
creating their own videos so I think
it'll be fun to kind of see what kind of
inspirations we took from the runway and
how we transform them into our own you
know daily looks from Lacoste - DKNY I
noticed that a huge makeup trend this
season was just a very fresh and
flawless face and also just a hint of
color on the cheeks to help contour your
face so that's actually the look that
I'll be recreating for you guys I was
actually very excited to film this video
because a lot of you guys were asking me
how I like to use my favorite foundation
because I mentioned this in my favorites
video so I did use this foundation on my
face today as well as in this video so
I'm really excited to show you guys how
I like to apply this and stuff so keep
on watching if you guys would like to
learn how to achieve a very fresh and
flawless face that was seen on a bunch
of the different shows this season
starting out by priming my face I'm
using the benefits de flawless 15 hour
primer and I'm just going to rub this
all over my face and then blend it in
with my fingers and this is just going
to ensure that your makeup stays on all
day
now going in with my Maybelline fit me
shine free foundation in the shade buff
beige I'm going to apply this onto my
face and then it blended in with a
contouring brush I noticed that I do not
need to use a concealer with this
foundation because it is very buildable
so I just apply on multiple layers to
any problem areas that I have
after that I'm going in with my
Maybelline fit me pressed powder in the
shade buff beige as well and I'm just
going to apply this all over my face to
set my foundation I'm grabbing the
bronzer from my lorac Pro to go palette
and I'm going to contour my face by
focusing on my cheekbones my temples and
my forehead
I'm also buffing in the bronzer on my
jawline my neck and to contour my nose a
little bit as well for cheeks i'm using
the maybelline fit me blush in the shade
light mauve and i'm just going to apply
this on the apples of my cheeks
lastly I'm going in with my bare
minerals well-rested face and eye
brightener to highlight my face and this
makes a huge difference so I'm just
applying it to my cheekbones the bridge
of my nose as well as my forehead
Cupid's bow and chin I just go and sing
it with this stuff so that is it for
today's video I hope you guys enjoyed it
be sure to check out all the other girls
that I went to Fashion Week with and of
course subscribe for more videos on my
channel as well as youtube.com slash
recreate the runway so I will talk to
you guys for a new video very soon and I
love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
