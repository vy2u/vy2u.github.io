want to focus on my under-eye circles by
using my Maybelline instant age rewind
eraser and since today's look is very
dark and dramatic I want to make sure
that my eyes look very bright and awake
I also really like to have very dark and
defined eyebrows when I do darker eye
makeup so I'm just using my benefit
brows agogo palette and filling in my
eyebrows using my NYX jumbo eye shadow
pencil in the shade of black bean I'm
just applying this all over my lids then
blending it out with a brush and this is
going to work as the base for all of our
eye shadows
time for the fun part I'm using my
Maybelline Color tattoo pure pigment in
the shade potent purple and I'm just
applying this all over my lids for a pop
of color
I think this purple really contrasts
well with my green eyes and I think it
looks really pretty with the black
eyeshadow too dark not my look I'm using
another one of Maybelline's pure
pigments in the shade of black mystery
and I'm just applying this into my outer
corners as well as in my crease and the
key to having a really good smoky eye is
to not be afraid to kind of step out of
your boundaries so as you can see here
I'm just using a blending brush to
figure out what shape works for me to
than smoking out the edges
to bounce off the eye makeup look I'm
grabbing that same black eyeshadow and
applying it to my lower lash line then
grabbing a fluffier brush I'm blending
everything out
once I'm done with that I'm going back
in with my purple eyeshadow and just
dusting it over my entire look just to
add in that last bit of color and of
course never forget to highlight your
eyes so I'm just going in with some
lighter eyeshadow and just applying it
onto my brow bone my inner tear duct and
as well as underneath my eyes because I
feel that it really helps to kind of
clean up the look and make it look more
crisp to tie in with the whole purple
theme I'm using Urban Decay's 24/7
glide-on eye pencil in the shade Ransom
and just applying it on my waterline and
tightline to finish off our eye makeup
look I'm grabbing my makeup forever
mascara and just applying it onto my
upper and lower lashes and that is it
guys it is so easy to create a smoky eye
so be sure to tweet me photos if you
guys recreate this look because I would
love to see them
I'd like to thank Maybelline for
partnering with me to create this video
for you guys and be sure to click on the
screen and check out all of Maybelline's
runway inspired videos so that's it for
