a very very requested video which is my
updated skincare routine and I was very
excited to do this because for the most
part I haven't really talked about any
of these products that I'm about to
mention so I think it's gonna be fun to
introduce you guys to basically my
everyday like Holy Grail items so I'm
just gonna go through everything that I
used at the night time and during the
morning and I also want to mention I
don't know if this is just me but
whenever I create like a skincare
routine for myself I tend to use
products from the same brand I think one
of the main reasons why is because I'm
such a perfectionist so I like having
everything from the same brand like
looking the same and stuff and I also
just feel like products work better when
they're used with other products from
that same brand because in a way I kind
of feel like they were made to work with
each other I don't know I don't know if
that's just me I feel like it is but
powerful if you guys do that too so yeah
first I'm gonna start off by telling you
guys step by step what I do during the
nighttime and then in the morning so the
first thing I like to do for my
nighttime routine is wipe off my face
makeup and my eye makeup so I will just
do that by using some sort of makeup
like cleansing wipes and this is the one
product that I tend to kind of switch
off between brands because I don't know
I don't really consider this like a part
of my skincare routine I just kind of
use it to get my makeup off um so here I
just have two brands that I've recently
been using this is the yes to cucumbers
soothing towelettes these are okay I
don't know I don't I feel like they
don't really do that good of a job with
like eye makeup and also I've been using
the clean and clear and makeup
dissolving facial cleansing wipes I like
these better but I also really really
like the Neutrogena ones those are
probably my favorite um but yeah I just
had these two right now and then after I
wipe off all my makeup I like to wash my
face with some sort of facial cleanser
and lately I've been using the clean and
clear essentials line sorry there was
like
on it so this is the face wash that I
like to use and I like the essentials
line because they have different
products for different skin types they
have one for sensitive skin and one for
oily skin I do have somewhat oily skin
like especially around my nose and my
cheeks and my forehead like t-zone um
but for some reason I just like the
sensitive ones better so yeah this is
the essentials foaming facial cleanser
for sensitive skin and the essential
line has like steps so this is step
number one and I really like this
because okay well a it smells really
good clean and clear products all smell
very good very fresh um so that's what I
really like especially in the morning
when you're like all tired and stuff it
kind of helps to wake you up but I like
this face wash a lot because it doesn't
burn my eyes and I know that sounds
weird cuz you're not you know you don't
put face wash on your eyes but whenever
I'm like rubbing at the face wash on my
face
um it always ends up getting in my eyes
like every single time I know it's
horrible but face washes tend to burn my
eyes when they like accidentally get in
but this stuff doesn't so you know
that's a plus right um so it doesn't
burn my eyes which is good that sounds
so weird but um yeah I like it it helps
clean everything out and I've been using
this for a very long time I really like
this so I wipe off my makeup I use this
and then I use a toner and this is from
the same brand in line this is the clean
clear essentials deep cleaning toner and
this is also for sensitive skin um
before I started using any of these like
products I've never actually used a
toner before and I regret that so much
because this is literally my favorite
step of my entire routine I will never
like not use a toner ever again I like
to just put this on a cotton pad or if I
don't have any I'll just put it on a
towel and just wipe it or dab it on my
face and I feel I don't know if it's
meant to do this but I just feel like it
just evens out my skin tone and just
makes my face really glow but also
treats and helps prevent pimples it's
oil free and I feel like it just kind of
gives you that extra deep cleanse and it
just gets
I'm gonna dirt makeup out that maybe it
was still on from the two other steps
that you did so yeah I've been using
this every single night so that's what I
use and then before I go to bed I just
use one more thing and I don't use this
every day because it kind of depends on
if I have any pimples on my face
um this is the clean and clear advantage
acne spot treatment I've talked about
this
I feel like quite a few times once I
really know uh-huh but yeah this is what
it looks like and I love this stuff guys
um basically what you do is you just
take a little dab of this you literally
don't need like anything and you just
put it on any acne or pimples that you
have and buy I would say two to three
days your pimples are gone um so that's
why I really like it the packaging said
like I think it's that a hundred percent
like see a difference and I totally
believe that because it literally saves
my life
oh it says right here 100 percent of
people show clear skin in just one day
so if you have not tried this I
recommend it because it's very very good
and this is perfect if you have any
offence or dances or parties or anything
and you've got that pimple that just
shows up randomly this will take care of
that and that is all that I do at night
time for morning my routine is a lot
more simple I just use two things
because I'm very lazy in the morning I
don't feel like throwing out a bunch of
stuff on my face so the first thing that
I do in the morning is just put on my
face wash so I just do the same one for
night and morning so I do that and then
I just put a moisturizer on my skin if
you guys have seen my past a skincare
routine video you know that I used to be
obsessed with the Burt's Bees what was
it called it was a moisturizer it was
like the cotton one I don't know what it
was called it was for sensitive skin
though and I still love that moisturizer
I ran out so I haven't been able to
repurchase it but lately I've been using
at the clean clear dual action
moisturizer and this stuff
she reminds me a lot of the Burt's Bees
one the only thing is this one has um I
don't know how to pronounce this though
soulless silic acids so uh I don't know
you you guys know what I'm saying right
yeah it's a little blah you guys yeah
okay so I've been loving this because it
has the benefit of moisturizing your
skin but it also treats and helps acne
so it's kind of like killing two birds
with one stone and I like this one a lot
because it is very thin just like the
Burt's Bees want it soaks into your skin
very fast so that's why I really like it
you guys know that I can't really thick
and cakey like moisturizers I just I
can't deal because then it's all sticky
and gross um so that's why I like this
because it's very thin and it dries very
quickly so that's all I use in the
morning I just wash my face and I
moisturize it and then usually I'll just
go eat some breakfast and by then my
face is you know perfectly hydrated and
everything and then I'll throw on my
makeup so that is my everyday skincare
routine I've been doing this for a
couple months now and I'm obsessed with
it it has worked so well for me comment
below if you guys have tried any of
these things and then we can share our
love for them and if you have not I
definitely recommend trying them out you
will not regret it
so that is it I hope you guys enjoyed
this video I'm sorry it was kind of
short and fast but I just really want to
get this up because it's been a very
very requested and as it for today's
video so I hope you guys enjoyed it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
