now and she says tell your viewers I say
hello and to hurry up on the gamin hurry
up
I wanted to know a couple of disclaimers
before I get in today's video
so first off I'm wearing red lips so I
feel like a completely different person
today and I'm also in a very good mood
right now because my mom surprised me
with Chinese food after school and I
just got a large box in the mail today
so today I'm going to be doing an
unboxing haul from brandy melville it's
my favorite store so I'm really excited
to do this video I wanted to do an
unboxing haul because honestly like who
does them anymore like I feel like no
one does unboxing halls anymore and they
were one of my favorite videos to watch
ever because I love seeing everyone's
first reaction so that's what I'm doing
today guys I'm so excited
alright so first off I've got this white
tank right here it's very simple it just
has buttons going down and it's crap
then I also got this white tank right
here and it just says California and it
has palm trees on it I also got two
high-low skirts and these are the first
high-low skirts that I've ever owned so
I'm really excited to try these out um
they're just short and then they go
along to a maxi skirt so I got a black
one and I got a dark grey one as well
they're shipping takes forever and I
honestly don't remember like half the
stuff I ordered so this kind of feels
like Christmas morning right now so I
also got this t-shirt right here it's
tan oh no it's a tank it's got like a
ripped sleeve look going on and it has a
bear on it and it says California
Republic and it's brown and it's cute
what is this oh wait I think this is my
scarf oh my god that is so weird
it literally it was like folded like a
blanket so I had no idea what it was but
this is my new infinity scarf which I'm
very excited for looks like this it's
like black and then like grey and yeah
looks like that then I also got this
cream tank
and it has a native-american like skull
on it so that's exciting and then also I
got this shirt no tank top and it looks
like this has an eagle on it also got
this lace dress and obviously I'm not
gonna wear this during the winter season
but it looks like this and um I don't
know what I'm gonna wear under it maybe
I can wear this is like a cover-up or
something but I thought it looked
interesting or it could be a really long
shirt or just a really short dress I
don't really know but you know I bought
it I just have one more bag left every
single time I want to buy from brandy
melville online this shirt is always
sold out but it finally was not when I
made my purchase so I was really excited
for this one it's just black and it has
like moons on it the last thing that I
got was this very thin gray hoodie and
this is the first hoodie that I've ever
purchased from them so I had no idea
what to expect
and it's like the material of like a
cotton shirt so it's pretty thin so it's
probably not gonna be very warm but this
will be great for layering and I am very
excited for this just like I am very
excited for everything else so that is
it for my unboxing haul and I know that
pretty much everything that I got is for
the summertime or is considered summer
clothing but I love wearing different
like pieces for the fall time especially
like tank tops and then like cardigans
and like skinny jeans and comment boots
so that's why I got a bunch of different
tanks from brandy melville that was like
the main reason why I placed the order
um but yeah so I'm definitely going to
be wearing a lot of this but just you
know underneath cardigans and all that
good stuff so I hope you guys enjoy
today's video and that that's it you can
just
happy Halloween everyone guys I'm
feeling pretty manly in this shirt right
now because it's like I'm musky cheese
I'm just trying to like show off my
muscles like you know okay so I will see
you guys later and that's it bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
