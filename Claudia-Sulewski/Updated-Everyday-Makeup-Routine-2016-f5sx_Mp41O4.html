being loved I lead you through the fame
my hair is so frizzy I look like
Hermione right now today's video is
going to be an updated everyday makeup
routine because I haven't filmed one in
a while and my products have definitely
switched around also if you're new to my
channel then be sure to click on the red
button up there to subscribe or
somewhere down there so that you can be
notified every time I upload a new video
after moisturizing my face I like to add
a little bit of primer this is a
mattifying primer that helps to kind of
keep your face oily free throughout the
day which my t-zone could definitely use
that and then afterwards I'm going in
with my foundation and I've been loving
this stick foundation I recently
mentioned it in a favorites video but I
just dab it onto my face and blend it in
with a big fluffy foundation brush
using my pro sculpting palette I am
choosing lettuce shade and dabbing that
underneath my eyes to brighten up the
area and conceal any dark circles that I
have
now of course you have to set everything
I'm obsessed with the Laura Mercier
translucent powder and I start off by
using a damp Beauty Blender and just
really packing that underneath my eyes
to kind of bake my face you guys know
that method I just don't really like to
let it sit because I get too lazy so I
use the rest of it to blend on to the
rest of my face I'm listening to these
voiceovers as I go and I feel like you
can really hear my morning voice so I'm
sorry but Zola GU moon but now I am
going in and sculpting sculpting
contouring my face with my benefit hoola
bronzer
on a typical day I will usually just use
that same bronzer with a smaller fluffy
brush for my eyes and just blend that
into my crease to darken them up and add
a little shape to them and then also I
like to flatten that brush out because
who has time to grab a new brush nobody
flatten it out with your fingers so it
has a thinner surface and apply it to
your lower lash line and then after that
I'm going in with this brow pencil but I
recently started using it I swear this
video isn't sponsored by makeup rubber
I'm just obsessed with their products
right now but I'm going in and filling
in my eyebrows and I've been really into
the lighter brows usually mine are super
dark but I'm kind of into the light and
natural look right now so I got a little
too eager and put on mascara one step
too early you guys will see in a bit but
Here I am applying on my benefit they're
real mascara to my upper and lower
lashes
this Tarte blush is incredible I'm a
sucker for pinky peach blushes I think
it just looks the best on my skintone
it's perfect for this time of year so
I'm just going in and very lightly
dusting it onto my cheekbones
I use this hourglass trio just about
every single day so I start off with the
most golden looking highlighter and
apply this to my lids see this is the
part where I was supposed to do this
before the mascara because you know that
sparkles fall on your lashes and whatnot
but we're just going to pretend like I
switch them and then I use the first
shade and just highlight the rest of my
face
these NYX lingerie liquid lipsticks
are incredible the one that I'm using
today is called bedtime flirt and I find
that with these products you will get
the best outcome if you use the least
amount of product as possible so I never
pump it back into the tube I just use
one side of the applicator and it looks
so good they lasts all day and then
afterwards of course I'm going to set my
face and makeup and that is it for my
everyday makeup routine
so that is it for today's video I really
hope you guys enjoyed it and I will see
you guys for a new one next week I don't
know that was good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
