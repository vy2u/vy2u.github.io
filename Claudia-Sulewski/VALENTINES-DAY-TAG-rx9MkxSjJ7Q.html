watching a dump his new tag video that
she created and it is called the
Valentine's Day why am i showing my
computer it's not like you guys can see
it oh but it's the Valentine's Day tag
and yeah she tagged me to do it and I
thought it would be really fun first
question is what are your thoughts on
Valentine's Day and why I really don't
understand how someone can hate
valentines day like I guess yeah the
single people might get kind of sad but
I personally love Valentine's Day I
think it's a very cute holiday where
people can you know spread the love and
stuff so I've always had pretty good
memories with Valentine's Day because
everyone is always and just such a good
mood number two have you ever had a
Valentine before alright love it this is
when the video kind of goes a little
downhill because I have never had a
Valentine before I'm sure I've had maybe
like one is a joke in elementary school
but like seriously no uh-uh
it's kind of sad but no um number three
what is the cutest thing that you have
ever experienced slash seen a friend
experience on a Valentine's Day and now
that I actually remember I think I was
asked to be someone's Valentine I don't
know what grade this is in I I feel like
it was like fourth or fifth or something
wow I was so mean okay I totally
remember this now okay so um what
happened I think this is Valentine's Day
I'm not sure I think it was though but
like in elementary school we didn't have
like wax on her lockers because you know
no one really stole stuff in elementary
school so I remember on Valentine's Day
I like opened up my locker and there was
like this little box in my locker and it
was like a heart-shaped necklace like I
don't I I think it was like diamonds
that form like a heart it was like a
little necklace and I had no idea who
gave it to me and I remember like trying
to figure out who gave to me for like
the entire day and that was like the
cutest thing ever it and I think when I
figured out who it was
I like freaked out because I was like oh
wait does this person like me because I
don't like them I like someone
because you know when you're in
elementary school you like like five
people at the same time I was like oh my
god wait but I don't like him so I think
I like getting the necklace back or
something I'm not really sure but that
is so mean but that was cute though
right
Wow I was such a bitch number four what
is your favorite Valentine's Day candy
ooh I really like the big like Hershey
kisses that are literally like this big
or something it's just basically like a
huge piece of chocolate I love any type
of chocolate but I do like the candy
like necklaces and bracelets just
because I love wearing them and just
kind of like eating them which now that
I think of that that's actually very
unsanitary and dirty because you're like
you know getting your bracelets all over
the place when you're eating it so
that's kind of gross but I like the
necklaces I think they're cute number
five do you have a Valentine this year
no probably not maybe I might have that
Valentine's Day loop or something but I
feel like no one really asks people to
be their Valentine where I come from but
I'm not sure maybe I'm just like the
only one who isn't being asked but I
probably will not death like yeah like
99.9% sure if you were to get a gift on
Valentine's Day what would it be so it's
basically asking what is your ideal gift
and I would definitely have to say like
a stuffed animal or some serv teddy bear
I think that would be so cute you know
like one of those like Valentine's Day
like themed bears um just like like hair
on school I'm just like hold it and
stuff I don't know I think that'd be
cute or like chocolate or something but
um yeah if you were to have a celebrity
Valentine who would it be Liam Hemsworth
hands-down no one else he is so freaking
hot especially with his accent
Australian accents are just beautiful if
you are a guy and you have an Australian
accent
then call me okay that is it for the tag
video I will specifically
a bunch of people in the downbar so make
sure to check the down bar if I tagged
you but if not then I tag off you guys
to do it so I'm just film this video
answering these questions and leave it

you guys for a new video very soon and
that is it bye
