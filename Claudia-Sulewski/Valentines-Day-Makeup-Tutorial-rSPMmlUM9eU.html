you can wear on Valentine's Day it's
mostly neutral with a pop of light pink
first apply on your favorite foundation
and then you're going to have to conceal
any dark circles or imperfections so I'm
using the 10 colors palette from BH
Cosmetics and this palette has 10
concealers from light to dark now
obviously I'm on the lighter side so
using my finger I'm just going to
conceal my under eye circles
then taking a little bit of a darker
shade I'm just going to conceal any
imperfections that I have around my face
once you're done with that just set your
face with some type of face powder
finish off your face with some kind of
light pink blush start out by priming
your eyes I'm using Urban Decay's primer
potion
now I'm going to grab Nyx's jumbo
eyeshadow pencil and milk and I'm going
to apply this into the tear duct and
inner corners of my eyes because this is
where the pink is going to be and when
you have a wider base the color will pop
out a lot more now the eyeshadows I'm
going to be used today is from the 120
colors palette third edition from BH
Cosmetics what's cool is this actually
has a bright color palette and then when
you lift that up there's also a palette
of neutral colors so this is great for
everyday so the first color I'm going to
choose is a light brown from the
Mutual's palette and I'm going to apply
this onto my entire lid avoiding the
inner corners so I'm even going to bring
it up to the crease now I'm going to
choose the color that's right next to it
and apply this onto my lid this will
brighten up to look so now from the
colors palette I'm going to choose these
to light baby pink colors and I'm going
to apply this into the inner corner of
my eyes and also in the tear duct the
pink eyeshadow will help with
brightening up your eyes
so from the neutrals palette I'm going
to choose a darker brown and I'm going
to apply this into the crease you want
to keep this look soft too so make sure
to blend out any harsh lines now for the
highlight I'm going to choose the first
eyeshadow from the colors palette and
apply this right underneath my brow bone
choose your favorite black gel eyeliner
and you're going to apply this on the
outer half of your upper lash line I'm
also going to apply this on my waterline
so next of course you have to curl your
lashes and apply on your favorite
mascara
so now it's time for the lips use the
same exact foundation that you are using
and apply a little bit on to your lips
you can also substitute this for a new
lipstick
then choose some sort of a light baby
pink lipgloss and apply this on your
lips as well
and now you're done if you want to try
out any of the pellets that I used in
this video please check out BH Cosmetics
