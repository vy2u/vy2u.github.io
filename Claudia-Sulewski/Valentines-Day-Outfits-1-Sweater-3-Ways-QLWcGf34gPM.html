inspired by Valentine's Day so I'm going
to be showing that is how I take a
simple baby pink sweater that is
currently being shown right over there
and incorporate it into three different
looks for three different occasions
keep in mind my style is pretty simple
most times so you will definitely see
that throughout this video but let me
know how you guys would style any type
of plain pink sweater for Valentine's
Day okay Claudia stop talking let's
start the video outfit number one is the
fancy and girly date look so it is
perfect for any Valentine's Day date the
sweater I will be featuring in all three
outfits is from Topshop so in the first
outfit I paired the sweater with a white
envelope skirt from Windsor I also
paired the look with this forever 21
statement PG necklace and some simple
studs from H&amp;amp;M
for shoes I went for some simple and
nude and white booties from forever 21
last but not least I chose to use my
quilted crossbody bag from forever 21
outfit number two is the casual and
comfy day look which is perfect if
you're just spending the day any of your
friends or girlfriends so obviously I'm
wearing the same sweater from Topshop
i belted my jeans with this thin black
belt from necessary clothing to give an
extra detail to my outfits and my
boyfriend jeans are from hmm I decided
to use my trusty favorite pair of H&amp;amp;M
booties with this outfit and lastly at
this black quilted purse from forever 21
outfit number three is the forever alone
look for all of my single chicas out
there who will be spending the day in
watching a lot of movies and even a lot
of chocolate so I'm starting off by
pairing the sweater with these adorable
pajama shorts from forever 21
they have macaroons on them guys and
these super fuzzy socks from Bath and
Body Works to put over my feet
here's a nice little visual of what my
Valentine's Day is going to look like
this year enjoy so that is it for
today's video I hope you guys enjoyed it
and if you would like me to create some
sort of Valentine's Day makeup tutorial
