recording outside today and I think this
is my first video ever taken well no
actually I have made vlogs outside so
never mind but if you guys can hear that
there's like a garbage truck going
around right now so this is kind of not
a very good time to record this video
but I just wanted to make a quick little
vlog discussing a couple of things first
thing which is really really random I
just found in my room but we had our
little yearbook photos or whatever and
this is mine so I really like how it
turned out that's like my yearbook photo
that's gonna be in my yearbook I just
repeated that so many times and I like
it cuz I look really tan in it and I'm
extremely white in this video because
there's like sun shining at me but
another thing that you guys have been
commenting about and asking me about is
how come all of my videos lately have
been suckish quality not as best as it
used to be and that is because I broke
my video camera and I know I told you
guys about that before and I thought my
dad took it in to like fix it but
apparently not so it's still broken and
I actually have it with me right now and
do you see that the lens like fell
inside of it so that's why it's not
working so it's really sad about that
but okay sorry my neighbor's windows are
all like open and they're probably
staring at me right now but so yeah
that's why I have been having really bad
quality on my videos lately so I'm sorry
about that
but another thing that I wanted to talk
about is Lux comm Lu Yu Yu XCOM and
that's kind of like a new website going
around that's getting really popular
with especially beauty girls here on
YouTube and basically it's just kind of
a website where everyone makes posts or
you make like a post and you comment and
like things so it's kind of like a blog
website I guess you can say but the
thing is the more you're on it the more
things you do on it you
earning Lux dollars so it's like kind of
online dollars and once you get enough
you can go to the shop section and
basically you can buy things with your
online dollars and like they'll send it
to you so for example I want to save up
for the iPad or they have like this
Canon like 500 D or something camera
which would be really awesome to
figuring that my camera is broken and
the hair is so bad today and it's kind
of cold outside - I thought it was gonna
be a lot more rare but it's a really
cool website so you just kind of do like
posts and stuff and I created one and I
think I have about three posts and I
just want to tell you guys about that
because it's really cool and I think
that not all of you know about it yet
but I know that a lot of you guys do and
I'm already tweeted about it on Twitter
but not a lot of you follow me on
Twitter so yeah I just want to tell you
guys on YouTube so down in the down bolt
down down bar I'm gonna have the links
to my post and page or whatever I'm
gonna find whatever links I can and I'm
like white like the Sun and then I go
here and I look normal so that's why I'm
really close to the screen right now so
I'll link that in the downbar so add me
as a friend and comment on my posts and
stuff it's really cool and is that all
that I wanted to say yeah I just want to
say that about that website tell you
guys about it cuz it's kind of like a
dream come true like a website where you
just do a bunch of stuff and then you
get free stuff like come on that's
awesome that's like - that's like -
amazing to be true so I just don't you
tell you guys about that and I really
chose a bad spot to record this video
but that's mainly just what I want to
say so I'll see you guys in another
video hopefully and yeah that's it bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
