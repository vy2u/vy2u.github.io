channel I am so excited about this video
because it has been so requested ever
since I uploaded my room tour for you
guys which by the way if you guys have
not seen the tour of this room the box
that I'm in right now
you can click right here I'll also have
it linked in the down bar but I didn't
want to make that video too long so I
left out my closet and bathroom but I
have been getting tons and tons of
requests since then for me to film this
video also before we get into it I
quickly just want to make a disclaimer
you guys know that I'm not trying to
brag in any type of way you're not
subscribed to me and you just randomly
stumbled upon this video I do not live
with my parents I live out in LA and pay
rent to live in this room and yes just
want to get that out of the way before
we get any negative nancies in the
comments down below okay
enough talking let's get into my closet
and bathroom tour we're going to keep
this video casual and I'm just going to
be holding my vlog camera as I show you
guys because I feel like that's easiest
to kind of really get into depth with
everything that's inside so when you
first walk in this is what you see the
lighting is actually super awesome up
here
I really appreciate like the back
lighting so when you walk in this is
what you see to the right in between
that we've got my bathroom and then this
is what is on the other side starting
off with the door I have a hook on it
and I throw on whatever purse I am using
lately so right now I've got this
backpack on there and then also I like
to hang my favorite black crossbody bag
up here we're going to start off on the
right side of my closet so over here
we've got these little cubbies with some
white baskets I got them from Target so
these top two baskets have all my kind
of winter snow stuff so we've got
scarves hats look things like that and
here we've got gloves stuff for
snowboarding up there I don't even know
what's up there because I haven't
touched those bins since moving over
here we've got this cute little silver
tray with all of my perfumes on it
and then underneath that I have a bin of
some extra purses that I don't really
use but I like to throw my belts in here
so it's kind of like accessories then
underneath that I've got four drawers so
the top two are filled with products
that I haven't used yet that either
companies sent to me or I'm just waiting
to try out down here we've got my
bathing suits
so this first drawer has all my bathing
suit tops and then down here we've got
my bottoms as well as some cool one
pieces and things like that moving on
over here we've got the majority of my
shirts and these are just the regular
length shirts short sleeve they go a
little longer back there and yeah I'm
not really going to go through them but
you've got shirts here then down here
we've got my tops that don't cover my
shoulders so any like spaghetti-strap
shirts tank stuff like that it slowly
fades into leotards and then we've got
rompers and t-shirt dresses and more
casual kind of dresses over here we've
got some fancier pieces I usually get
rid of my dresses if I wear them to a
certain event because if it already gets
photographed I usually don't wear it
ever again so I just like to sell it
but these are a few of the pieces that I
kind of kept so you might be able to
recognize some of them above that we've
got a purse and some scarves so moving
on to this little middle piece right
here this is like my favorite part of
the closet because I love these little
glass doors it just makes it look like a
little store so opening this up on the
first shelf we've got some of my jewelry
and all these little organizational
pieces and stuff are from Michaels so
these and all the black things my bigger
rings over here my mom brought me this
little Western styled choker and you tie
it around your neck and it looks so cool
so I'm really excited about that thanks
mom and then we've got some studs
chunkier necklaces bracelets above that
we've got purses backpack another bag up
there a hat my adidas duffel bag that I
use for traveling then underneath that
we've got my fancier bras so like lacy
bra let's things like that
Pastis pretty much anything that your
boobs need then below that I've got
shirts that I can't hang so these are
two tube tops and then we have some
fancier like sleeveless cropped tops and
some bandanas and things like that
underneath that we've got some extra
hangers I know I pronounced that word
weird leave that's just how I grew up
saying it but you guys will notice that
I like to use the same hangers I just
think it looks nicer and since they're
super thin you actually save a lot of
space and they grip onto your clothes
nicely so I like to get all of mine from
Amazon because I just buy them in bulk
and they're great i 100% recommend we've
got my fancier pants so flowy kind of
silk high-waisted pants things like that
and then in the last drawer we've got
some maxi skirts and a random cardigan
moving on to the left up here we've got
my crop tops gotta love a good crop top
so we've got quite a bit of those and
then underneath we have my skirts and as
you can see I bought these little clip
things that you can also get on Amazon
and they clip onto the hanger and help
you store in your bottoms and it's great
so we've got lots of skirts and then
going over here we've got the majority
of my shoes I would say so we've got
boots heels things like that I'm not
really gonna go through all them but you
know you guys can see she was very fun
up there I have these really cool like
crochet knee boots from Nasty Gal here
we've got some longer like dresses maxi
stuff like that actually a company
recently sent me this row but I thought
it was so cool because it says claudius
whiskey on it so maybe I'll wear it for
like a Halloween costume one day or
something I think Nix did it hopefully I
got that right and then underneath that
we've got my favorite boots in the
entire world - they're Stuart Weitzman
over-the-knee boots so I've got the grey
and black ones and they have their own
little special spot so that is it for
the right side of my closet then going
this way this is what it looks like
again we've got another little shoe
shelf over here with just my sneakers
and running shoes flat tops whatever you
guys want to call them got some Adidas
sneakers in here these are fun yeah
that's kind of an idea of the shoes that
I own but over here we've got my more
casual graphic t-shirts there you go
I like don't know how in-depth I should
be going with this stuff but underneath
that we've got my lighter jackets so I'm
always reaching for this area because I
have my denim jackets from Topshop and
then over here we've got some longer
sleeve shirts button-up shirt it's kind
of stuff like that then going this way
we've got all my sweaters so down here
we've got a few more kind of fancier
ones it kind of starts to mix but over
here we've got like my hoodies and my
crewnecks
then we've got another little glass
showcase shell thing I don't know what
it's called but up there we've got some
backpacks a bag another purse here I've
got my baseball caps so I just kind of
line them up behind each other and then
we've also got some more accessories and
all of these little things once again
are from Michaels I also have these
little hooks that are great to store
your necklaces now here are all my
intimates so we've got bras very fun
underwear also very fun socks not as fun
anymore these are like my everyday white
socks we've got my pyjama shirts and
then lastly just some pajama bottoms
jackets leather jackets suede flannels
more back there than underneath we've
got kind of thicker heavier and warmer
coats then going this way we've got the
majority of my bottoms to airplane
pillows some yoga pants thicker
sweatpants fancier kind of material
shorts underneath that we've got all of
my denim shorts folded up and then
lastly all of my longer jeans and I
recently just started rolling them and I
actually love it so much more because
it's saving space but also I can see all
of my pants better than just folding
them on top of each other up here we've
got two bins and there is nothing fun in
them they're just like
bags and things like that sunglasses
really nice having them kind of laid out
so you can see all them though at the
top we've got sports bras clearly I
really like grey sports bras and then
underneath that we've got my workout
shirts and tops workout shorts leggings
most of mine are in the wash right now
and then lastly we've got tights longer
socks fuzzy socks so that is actually it
for my closet and yeah I really love a
space it clearly gives me a lot of
variety to kind of organize everything
in different ways so I definitely
switched around a bunch of stuff but
it's fun it's it's yeah I like it okay
now going this way we've got my bathroom
the lighting just went super blue
compared to how orange it was in there
but I'll give you guys a little overview
so the bathroom got like two windows up
there
and shower toilets so first up we have
this little three-part laundry cart and
I got from Amazon it's awesome because
it rolls super easily and I'm able to
separate my darks for my colors for my
ways here's my bathtub it's really fun
because there's little air holes at the
bottom and they shoot out so they're
like little Jets back there I usually
keep my lush products in that jar but I
haven't gotten any in a while then here
is a little overview of my countertop
bobby pins clips hair ties this is a
makeup setting spray face cleanser
lotion retainer hand towel just like
listing them I got this little mercury
glass from Target oh this little white
marble soap holder is from that bath
beyond but we've got toothbrush
toothpaste this thing is awesome a
bareMinerals actually sent it to me and
it is a little brush bar so you take
this off and you've got every single
brush that your face would ever
need and it's nice because it protects
it from any dust and bacteria falling on
your brushes and then next to that I use
this for my makeup every day it's just a
little L mirror from Ikea and then we've
got some more soap and this little glass
jar of my face masks my two bath mats
are from Target and then let's let's get
into this hopefully you guys find this
entertaining I really enjoy organizing
things so I'm personally having a great
time filming this this drawer is used a
lot so we've got tweezers little
scissors I've got my makeup wipes in
here it perfectly fits like can we talk
about that real quick and then over here
we've got like floss face stuff
deodorant extra brushes benefit products
random sprays then below that we've got
my hair brushes and scrunchies hair
bands kind of things like that and then
lastly we've got some little traveling
organizers for toiletries makeup
underneath the first sink it looks like
this we've got most of my hair products
lined up as well as these little empty
bottles coz I travel a lot so I like to
put my shampoo and conditioner into them
and then in this bottom drawer we've got
all of my st. Tropez mousse and tanning
products stuff like that and then above
that we've got my little tanning mitts
for the mousse next to that we've got
some of my makeup these drawers are from
the Container Store they're really
convenient this plastic bin has all my
nail polishes nail filers then going
above that we've got my everyday makeup
so this is pretty much what I use every
single I don't use all of them everyday
obviously but this is what I usually
like to grab for when I'm doing my
makeup and it's nice having everything
in one spot because I just had this open
and I do my makeup with the mirror that
is it from that shore going under here
we've got some more super exciting stuff
yeah amazing all the way to the left top
drawer
we've got women's products everything
you need when being a girl underneath
that we've got
my hair tools so curlers straighteners
coconut oil and then lastly we've got
some products that I've yet to use that
I've just received over the past few
months from like companies and stuff and
then in this corner we've got my shower
which is so huge and I love it so much
very appreciative of it so starting off
on this wall this is probably the
greatest thing I could have ever done
was hanging one of these little sticker
hooks because I just hang my loofah on
there it's some body wash and shaving
stuff razors shampoo conditioner more
face face stuff I can't talk today and
yeah that is the shower hopefully it
wasn't too eques in there and then
lastly we've got the toilet garbage can
toilets winter themed mat that I just
haven't gotten rid of yet and then I
really like this little corner thing I
got it from Target built it put it up
and I feel like it adds a nice little
completed touch to that random little
corner and then also I use this ring
light for my makeup everyday I bring it
back to the mirror and use that and then
usually I have towels here but they're
dirty right now so we're going to
pretend like I have white towels hanging
there and lastly a scale so that is it
for my bathroom and closet or I hope you
