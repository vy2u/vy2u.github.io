but if you can see behind me I've got a
new background and that is because I am
officially moved into my new apartment
in LA and that is why I haven't uploaded
video in like two weeks it's been so
long also I apologize if the lighting is
kind of funky if it's too bright or I
don't really know yet I haven't really
figured out where I want to film slash
what I'm gonna do like my lighting and
stuff so hopefully this is okay but
basically I just wanted to film a little
sit-down life update vlog type thing
with you guys woo
so the past two weeks have been just a
little bit hectic my parents moved in
with me for a few days my dad stayed
about three nights I would say and then
my mom stayed for about like a week we
can have for something like that so I'm
currently living alone in this apartment
right now but you guys are also probably
wondering where the heck is Aspen I
thought you were moving in with Aspen I
am and she actually is coming over not
coming over she's moving here tomorrow
so I am beyond excited for Aspen to get
here but I've been here for about two
weeks and it's just been very crazy I've
been going all over the place
seeing a bunch of my friends here and
stuff like that so I haven't really been
able to kind of sit down and talk to you
guys I also forgot my um battery charger
for this camera which is great so I had
to charge my battery with Alex a doesn't
been able to film for that reason so
hopefully my battery doesn't die in the
middle of today's video but I've got a
full bag so I think I'll be good so I'm
waiting for my mom to ship me my battery
still cannot believe that I forgot that
that is like such an important thing
also if you guys may have not noticed
yet but I dyed my hair blue so let me
know what you guys think about this I'm
really liking it it's a bit different
last night I actually decided that I
wanted to go for like a bluey purple and
it ended up being a lot more blue than
purple but I am I'm ticking it right now
I really like it let's see what else did
I want to talk about I just want to film
a hello and welcome to my new bedroom
type of video so I'll give you guys a
little sneak peek of what my room looks
like right now but I also wanted to
mention that I have been vlogging a ton
I pretty much flogged every single day
of like my first week here on me getting
in the furniture and my parents helping
out and all that stuff so if you guys
want to check out those blogs I will
have them linked in the down bar yeah my
blog channel is beyond beauty start TV
in case any of you guys are wondering I
don't really like the username but I'm
kind of stuck with it so yeah these are
TV also I want to mention that I filmed
one last video in my room before I moved
and it is a summer morning routine but
that video is taking a while to edit
because I want it to be all like cool
and stuff so I just wanted to warn you
guys that in the near future I'm going
to be uploading a morning routine and
you guys will notice that it was filmed
at my old room so just letting you know
that video is coming just be patient
so yeah after that video goes up maybe
I'll do kind of like a morning routine
California edition or something like
that I don't know let me know what you
guys want to see and any other videos as
well if just comment down below any
video requests that you guys have
because I just feel very like motivated
and inspired to do really cool videos
here in LA because I've so many
youtubers that can actually like help me
out and that I could clad with and stuff

incredibly amazing and fun and every
single day has been an adventure so far

happens that just no one would expect to
happen but yeah I just want to say that
