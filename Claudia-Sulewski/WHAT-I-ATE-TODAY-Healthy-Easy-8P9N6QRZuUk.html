on Goma bella jalaluhu nob realist rebus
threat they're gonna put the belfast
ajar so tell gel adenoma hey guys
welcome back to my channel so today's
video is going to be about food I love
food I'm sure a lot of you guys love
food and I definitely feel like I don't
talk about food enough on this channel
so we are fixing that issue right now
right here today for the most part these
are the most common meals that I like to
cook for myself especially throughout
the weekdays
of course like every other beauty guru
always States before their video I am
not in any way some sort of health
expert or food nutritionists or anything
like that
these are just the foods that I really
really enjoy eating and for the most
part they're very healthy and beneficial
towards your body and all of that stuff
if you guys try out any of these meals
be sure to tweet me and send me a photo
because I love seeing your recreations
but I'm going to stop talking now and
get into the video so the first thing I
like to do when I wake up in the morning
is drink some sort of liquid whether it
might be some ice-cold water or tea
sometimes coffee but I usually try to
stay away from that but for the most
part I'll just have a really large glass
of iced water this helps to kind of
clear out your system kickstart your
metabolism if you want to get crazy but
there are some lemon in there that's
really good for you as well but I'm
usually way too lazy to do that so next
up we've got breakfast which is by far
my favorite meal of the entire day so
I'm sure most of you guys can guess what
I'm about to say because I am obsessed
with these and I always talk about it
but I pretty much always have a smoothie
bowl for breakfast it's basically a
smoothie without any type of liquid so
it's a lot thicker kind of like an ice
cream consistency that is usually
I eat it's delicious it's healthy so I'm
all about snacking in between meals it's
actually better for your body to be
eating smaller meals and eating more
frequently throughout the day so sign me
up
yes I I can snack I'll do that
so normally I'll try to get some sort of
vegetable in between breakfast and lunch
so usually what I like to go for are
some carrots and hummus I get the cutest
little hummus packets from Costco and I
will pretty much eat as many carrots as
I want because they are so good for you
so I'll just finish the entire little
package and eat however many carrots I
want so now for lunch time I like to eat
some sort of protein and some vegetable
so normally it is a salad specifically a
Caesar salad
I am obsessed with Caesar anything
Caesar wraps Caesar salads the other day
is talking about with my friends if we
were a food like I would be a Caesar
salad wrap I like to get my chicken from
Trader Joe's because I don't really like
to get any type of meat from large
corporation just because I've watched
way too many documentaries it's
vegetarian fed and it's just the best
option that I can find personally so
kind of a few slices of those and I will
usually drizzle them in some sort of
lime or lemon and I'll just sprinkle on
some lemon pepper on both sides but
while that's cooking I prepare my salad
so I usually like to cut my lettuce in
smaller pieces because it is way easier
to eat and I'll top it with some Caesar
dressing or any type of vinaigrette
once I'm done cutting that up the
chicken is usually done so I'll throw
that on with some croutons and that is
my lunch next up it is time for my
second snack of the day and usually I'll
have some sort of fruit because by then
I'll be craving something sweet and
lately I've been obsessed with frozen
grapes they are so good I always buy
these like concord grapes or something
like that I don't know they taste a
little bit different but something is
really really good about them so I'll
usually have those or green grapes or
purple or really anything I would never
discriminate a grapes color
yeah I'll pretty much eat as much as I
want of those I'll usually prepare like
a bowl and I'll just snack on that and
then for dinner I decided that I wanted
to have some avocado toast with an egg
on top and dinner is definitely the most
what's the word unstable meal of my diet
I guess not really a diet more of a
lifestyle thing whatever vomit dinner is
definitely the most different every
single day sometimes I'll do like some
brown rice pasta or some sort of protein
or I'll do a salad or soup or I don't
know like you know I eat a lot of things
food is fun to eat the meal that I chose
to eat for dinner today is usually a
breakfast meal for me but I had a lot of
avocados sitting in the kitchen so I
didn't want them to go bad but basically
what I did was toast two slices of
Ezekiel bread that is my favorite type
of bread it is so good for you it's
low-sodium it just tastes really good so
I will toast two slices of those and I
will take half of an avocado mash it up
and kind of leave that off to the side
then I'll grab one egg this is kind of
optional sometimes we just don't have
eggs in the house but I'll cook an easy
over egg on a pan with some coconut oil
and once my toast is done usually my egg
is done it's perfect timing then of
course you have to season it so I like
to put some sort of herbs on it because
I try to stay away from salt and things
like that but I have this jar of like
herbs or preservatives or something I
don't know it's some sort of delicious
mix but I just wrinkle that over the two
slices and that was my um dinner
technically breakfast for dinner type of
thing
I don't know I've been really obsessed
with it so that is what I ate today if
any of you guys have seen my first like
what I ate today teppan video I filmed
it like years ago back in Chicago if you
guys saw that video you would
that I have definitely improved since
then because I watched that video just
shaking my head I use the microwave in
like every single meal which is so bad
for you I was also just eating really
boring meals I don't know if when I
showed you guys today seems like not a
lot of food for you then you can totally
eat more as long as you're eating
natural Whole Foods that are as close as
they possibly can be to its most natural
form so you know no like packaged
chemical stuff whatever then yeah I
totally encourage to eat as much as you
want until you're full because you
should be listening to your body but
yeah hopefully this video gave you guys
some inspiration or ideas on a certain
type of meals that you possibly want to
try out for the first time if you guys
want to see more types of videos from me
like this then be sure to give this
video a big thumbs up to let me know
because I love talking about this stuff
I know it's a little more controversial
and definitely more sensitive but I'm
pretty much an open book so if you guys
want it I'll give it to you but that is
it for today's video I hope you guys
enjoyed it and I will see you guys for a
new one next week bye okay we're gonna
start off with these they kind of look
like fake little icecream cones but
they've got like air pockets in them so
we'll see how that goes oh there's so
much I'm going to start off with
chocolate
it's hard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
