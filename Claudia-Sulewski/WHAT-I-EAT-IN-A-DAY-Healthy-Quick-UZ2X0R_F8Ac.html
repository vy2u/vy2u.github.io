hoodies in all my videos now but I just
want to be comfortable you know
today's video is food and health related
we are doing a what I eat a day
basically I'm going to be showing you
guys the recipes I make and the food
that I eat from morning to night time of
course every single day is different so
this is not what I'm eating every single
day but it's a pretty good picture of
what I like to put in my body as of
lately I have been very very good about
working out lately I am very proud of
myself for that one I was about to like
clap but it's that right here I am
getting up getting ready getting sweaty
that rhymes my breakfast is usually a
protein smoothie the days when I work
out lately I've been going through a
huge chocolate protein smoothie phase
I've been loving putting avocado into my
smoothies I promise you don't taste it
it just makes it so creamy and adds in
those healthy fats I'll put in half of
an avocado as well as one frozen banana
and then also I threw in some baby
spinach as well for the added vitamins
nutrients then I'll go in with the
recommended amount for this protein
which is two scoops and then also to
make it even richer and taste even
chocolatier there's that word I don't
know I'll take the same scooper and I'll
just add like a scoop of cacao powder
into my smoothie and cow is also a great
superfood I was feeling a little frisky
today a little fancy little extra so I
added in some humm raw Beauty green
superfood powder and this is in the mint
chocolate chip
infusion flavors so if anything it helps
the chocolate flavor even more adds in a
little bit of mint to help to boost
energy radiant skin metabolism it's got
raw greens adaptogens enzymes probiotics
I mean this powder is awesome I love
them and then lastly just pouring some
almond milk blend it all up and it is so
freakin good you guys it literally
tastes like a chocolate milkshake I've
been craving it every single morning
and genuinely look forward to it yes
next up I want to share my little
caffeine fix that I've been doing I've
been all about matcha you guys know
vital proteins matcha collagen powder is
so freakin good
and lately I've been having it iced
which is super easy to do so I have
these glass bottles from this like juice
store that is called creation out here
and I save the glass bottles with the
caps all I do is I add in a little bit
of water into the glass I throw in the
matcha powder as well as a little bit of
stevia for sweetener then I cap that
shake it up to make sure there are no
like matcha chunks or anything and then
I'll go in and I'll add in my ice my
almond milk to make it creamy and it is
so good so I've pretty much been doing
that versus you know coffee or tea I
still need tea but I've just really been
all about the matcha I kind of failed to
show this part but I had like a big
glass bowl of cut up strawberries and I
was just kind of snacking on them
throughout like my morning my lunch was
pretty weird today honestly it's because
I wanted I wanted toast but then I also
had like the little but slice you know
it sounds so weird you know like the end
of the loaf like the thin slice that
like barely counts like a slice you're
like yeah sure I'll have that as well
I wanted to originally make like a
sandwich but then I ended up just making
two open-faced sandwiches because they
both taste so good on their own that I
was like I'm just gonna split it up and
eat them as separate so basically I just
did a classic like avocado toast I took
half of an avocado sliced it up and laid
that on the toast my - like little spice
seasonings that I like to put on top is
the everything but the bagel seasoning
blend from Trader Joe's it is so
freaking good it makes you taste like
you're eating a bagel and so I'll
sprinkle that on as well as some red
chili flakes for the other half sandwich
I've been really into like veggie
patties chicken patties veggie burgers I
don't know I like crumbling them on
salads I like eating them alone I like
eating them on bread so today I'm
showing you guys the quinoa cowboy
veggie burger it's from Trader Joe's
also over the avocado toast I grabbed
and I cooked it over easy on the veggie
burger I also added some organic ketchup
from Trader Joe's and that was my lunch
it's kind of weird I know but like
tastes really good next up I want to
show you guys my little midday juice
trick I guess I really really like
drinking lemon water but sometimes I'm a
little lazy and I don't want to you know
do the whole like lemon thing cut it put
it in the bank squeeze it seeds it's
just like it's you know it's like a
whole thing in itself and so lately I've
been buying this juice from Whole Foods
and it has apple lemon and ginger in it
and those are all super grade so what
I've been doing is I don't really like
drinking press juices or there's like a
lot of sugar in them it's just so much
flavor and its really sweet and so what
I've been doing is actually just
splitting it into thirds as you guys see
I'm just using like 1/3 of the juice
pouring it into a larger water bottle
thing and then just filling up the rest
with ice and water sticking a straw
through and it's so great it's more of
like a flavored water lemon water type
thing I also do this with different
types of juices too like watermelon
juice or any sort of green juice - my
dinner was super easy to make I resort
to this rest I can't even call it a
recipe I resort to this meal so often
just because it's so easy which is just
cutting up some chicken putting it on
the pan and then some veggies on the
side so today I was using some organic
fresh chicken breast and I'm just cut it
up I like to like marinate the chicken
in olive oil cracked black pepper also
this like poultry seasoning that is so
so good I always put it on my chicken
throw that on the pan and then today I
was using this stir-fry kit so I got
from Whole Foods and it's just a bunch
of vegetables it also came with a
teriyaki sauce normally I try to use
either like half the packet or I just
don't use it at all cuz I don't mind
having just like simple vegetables with
just like a little bit of salt and
pepper or whatever but today I was
you know I felt like I I got my butt
kicked in the morning so I'm gonna have
that teriyaki sauce I just cooked it all
in a wok pan and then I also added in a
chicken so the chicken also got some of
that sauce and I kind of justified like
being able to use all the sauce
definitely like made a lot more chicken
that I need it to but that's fine you
know we just like left at this but yeah
super super easy dinner it tasted so so
good lastly I thought I would include a
little nighttime treat because hey
listen once you're done with your day's
work you want to watch a movie or
whatever brief intermission my card was
full we're good
okay does the frame feel different why
do I feel closer what sigh I'm going
insane who is he talking about
oh my nighttime snack usually at the end
of the day I like to wind down on my
couch whether it's watch a movie watch a
TV show sit on my phone read a book
whatever I usually have a nighttime
snack it always ends up happening even
on my best and healthiest days I always
end up somehow screwing myself over on
this particular evening I was feeling
like a glass of rose a to myself was
what I needed that rose a the one that
I'm showing is so so good but I just
poured myself a glass and then along
with that I had some boom chicka pop
popcorn but I kind of just took the
whole bag with me and then drank my rose
a and watched a good flick you know
that's it for today is what I ate in a
day video let me know if you guys
enjoyed this style it was actually super
easy for me to make because as you guys
saw I just kept all of the food clips
very casual and vlog style so it was
really easy for me to show you guys like
what I'm cooking and I didn't have to
like set up a tripod and everything let
me know if you guys like that because I
had a lot of fun with this one
I will see you guys for a new video very
soon I think it's gonna be a collab with
a fellow youtuber you get excited be
