today I'm going to be filming a very
very requested video which is what I got
for Christmas I don't know if I made
this video last year but I've definitely
done it in the past and you guys really
enjoyed watching it it's getting really
hot in my room so I'm going to open a
window also apologies for the lighting
and quality of this video because I'm
currently filming off of my vlogging
camera and I'm back home in Chicago so I
don't have my lights and everything I'm
just using my windows but this Christmas
was amazing as far as the memories that
we made and the presents that we all got
everyone just seems really happy and
everyone was really in good spirits this
year so I'm very very grateful for that
of course it's been amazing of being
home back in Chicago with everyone
because it's very different out in LA
and you you tend to miss it yeah I'm
gonna get into the things that I got for
Christmas
so first charters I only asked for one
thing this year because I usually don't
ask for things I like to be surprised
and I like seeing what my family chooses
to get for me and stuff but I did ask
for one thing this year because I had
this before but I ran out so I really
wanted to get another one and it is the
Ebola juicy perfume I love the smell of
this perfume so much it's perfect for
going out occasions if you're going
somewhere to dinner or party because it
definitely has more of a mature scent
which is good for nighttime but it's
still very sweet and girly this is
awesome because it came with the actual
perfume and then a little to go roller
which is so so convenient I did not
expect to get this so I'm really really
excited to have that little piece so
yeah that is the first thing that I got
and I'm very very happy about it so this
next gift is so so random but so awesome
and I can't wait to have it in my room
because you guys know how much I love
home decor and buying things for the
house and my room and things like that
and when I saw this my jaw just dropped
because it's amazing what um so
basically it's like this giant metal
rustic looking old-fashioned perfume
bottle but it's also a little piggy bank
which is awesome because I actually
needed something to put my change into
so this is
perfect and I'm so excited because it's
definitely going to match in my
monochromatic room this is the stuff
that I love I love it next up I got a
few things from Victoria's Secret
first off I got this little like black
silk robe thing it's interesting because
it has shorter sleeves it has cute
little lace sleeves and then it's just
like a short little robe and I think
it's so so durable and then also cute
black underwear you know my mom gets me
she knows to get me black things now
that I think of it everything that I got
is either very neutral or black and
white so clearly I'm happy next up my
brother got me this book which is going
to be the perfect coffee table book
because we need to invest in a coffee
table and once we do we'll have books to
put on top of it I do not want to
butcher that but that is the title of
this book and basically he is a famous
fashion photographer so it's really
interesting going through these pictures
because there's just different pictures
of fashion all around the world with
people of all different shapes sizes
ages yeah and it's really really
beautiful so I'm excited to kind of look
through this and just look at the
different things that people are wearing
like how cool is this page I'm excited
Thank You Marcin this bad boy over here
was given to me last night at Christmas
Eve because this year my momma but this
year my mom look I can't talk because
this year my mom wanted to gift us with
matching pajamas so that we can all go
to bed matching she's freaking adorable
so my mom and I got these super fuzzy
black-and-white checkered onesies and
then all the guys wore like black
crewnecks with red plaid pajama pants I
think everyone is still wearing them and
it's so funny cuz like if anyone is
walking towards me you can't tell who it
is cuz everyone's wearing the same thing
so you think it's gonna be like my dad
and then it's like my brother I'm like
what I guess I'll show this I didn't
really get this for Christmas but my mom
gave it to me a few days ago she like
randomly brought it into my room and
it's awesome basically it's like this
little shoulder pad that you heat up by
plugging it
to an outlets there you go and it warms
up your shoulders and it feels awesome
every single time I'm in bed I'm like
you know what we could turn this on real
quick also TMI but I feel like when I'm
on my period I could totally put this
like on my stomach and have my tummy a
warm because the cramps are not a fun
thing
so this gift is super random but I very
much appreciate it because it's one of
those things that I've been wanting to
invest in but just never know where to
get it and now I have in my life it's
it's a good year so there's one last
thing that I got from Santa this year
and I nearly lost it
when I open this up okay so this next
gift I've actually been wanting to buy
for myself for months now and the fact
that they knew to buy this for me for
Christmas is absolutely insane because I
never told anyone in my family I think I
may have mentioned it in one video my
mom was saying that she heard it in a
video or something like that but I don't
understand how these are here because
they're always on a stock of it let me
just show that you guys I know I'm being
so annoying so they are a pair of Stuart
Weitzman boots oh my gosh okay so you
guys know that I recently invested in
the black over the knee boots which I
wear all the time
I'm so so obsessed with them so
immediately after getting those I really
really want to get the gray ones because
they're super super pretty and that's
exactly what I got for Christmas guys
you don't even know how happy I was to
open this up because these boots were
one of those things where I was thinking
about like okay what would make
Christmas morning really really awesome
this year oh I would love those boots
but there's no way any one out of my
family would know that I wanted these
slash they're always out of stock but
apparently my mom ordered these months
ago and they were going to arrive in
March but out of nowhere they arrived
right before Thanksgiving this is like
I'd be like I'm acting so ridiculous for
being so happy over a pair of shoes but
I have just been wanting these in my
life so badly and it was so sweet of my
parents to get me these I'm sorry I mean
Santa I'm so happy so basically they're
just suede
with any boots they've got a little heel
to them and super good quality is super
comfortable so that is everything that I
got for Christmas this year I know this
video was a little short and very casual
literally in a pajama shirt from like
Florida or something but I hope you guys
had an awesome holiday season whether
you celebrate Hanukkah or Christmas the
most important thing is that you spend
it with your family or the loved ones in
your life it's a really good time to
reflect on the year that has passed us
and all the good things that came into
our lives throughout it so while we're
getting cheesy here I just want to say
thank you guys so much for your
continuing to support on my main channel
and my blog channel and you guys
seriously made this year amazing for me
and I'm just so so excited for 2016 I
hope you guys have an awesome and safe
New Year's Eve and I will see you guys
in the new year oh yeah
also in case you guys forgot I'm doing
vlogmas so I've been vlogging every
single day this month and today is
actually my last day which is so sad
alright I love you guys so much and I'll
talk to you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
