channel today's video is going to be a
try on haul and well other things that
you can't really try on there is bath
and Bodyworks stuff I'm really excited
about a lot of these pieces a lot of
them I've shown actually on my Instagram
and you guys have been asking where is
this from so I'm gonna start off with
clothing let's jump into it lately a
trend that I've been loving I mean it's
not even I feel like they've always been
around but for me personally this has
just been like a huge trend that is wide
legged pants I think they look so
flattering when they're high-waisted and
like fit real nice on the waist and then
they go wide at the legs oh I'm so into
it anyway so these are actually a little
more like edgier and rocker than most of
mine I have a lot of like wide-legged
jeans but these are navy blue and maroon
and they're plaid yeah they're just
material pants from Urban Outfitters and
they've got the little front zip a cute
little chain on the side up it's a great
look when this I would do like a little
crop top and like a leather jacket or
something and there you go you got you
got a little Night Out look the next
thing I want to show you guys is a
little funky it's a little funky fresh
and it's definitely like the craziest
thing I own right now but I'm obsessed
with it it's a little pantsuit what
we've got let's let's undo this real
quick so we've got a little blazer which
also has just been a vibe that I've been
really into lately it's like rainbow and
velvet striped and this whole suit is
from House of Harlow times revolve so I
got it from revolve so you've got the
jacket we've got this little crop top so
cute it's just got little like buttons
in the front and it's spaghetti strap
and then of course the wide legged pants
they're all just the same material and I
think it just looks super cool so we
just button in the front and they're
super long super flowy it's good next up
I've got a leather jacket and that I've
been obsessed with I got this from Zara
oh it's so good
you've got these little red and white
stripes on the sleeves and down on the
bottom and then on the back you've got
this little detail it just has a nice
like motorcycle biker vibe and I think
it just spices up any look you can just
wearing like a white v-neck some black
jeans some boots
done you're you're out the door tying in
with the winter theme I'm all about
sweaters right now it's actually not
that hot in LA right now but the trick
is ladies and gentlemen is to put your
AC on and then you feel like it's
wintertime actually the first thing I
want to show is what I'm wearing right
now looks like yes oh it's got like
wider sleeves this is from Urban
Outfitters online I love the v-neck I
feel like it has a guy kind of like a
schoolish vintage like athletic vibe
with the stripes I don't know
I'm into it and I love yellow and then
also during the same online purchasing
session I also got this little cropped
sweater which i think is so cute very
fitting for california because yeah it's
cropped you know so it's like it's not
like too wintery looking but it has a
nice little turtleneck zip up little
moments happening up here with the white
detail and yeah thank you going back to
the sort of business e pant suit blazer
vibe I've got this jacket which I feel
like this has actually been like very
very trendy lately this jacket is from
urban got it online I get a lot of stuff
in online
it's got like little buttons right here
and it's just a cute little fitted
jacket the way that I wore this but it
was just like a little crop top and
black jeans also like a nice black
hoodie underneath this to kind of make
it a little more casual versus
business√≠ I'm just really into the
pattern and the kind of it's the last
clothing article that I want to show you
guys is another sweater
hence winter haul it's all wintery
things I was in Chicago I was hanging
out with Stefan and his sisters and we
all went Black Friday shopping at Old
Navy
I don't even we're just like yep this is
what we're doing and I found the
greatest cardigan ever I've always
wanted just like a gray chunky long
cardigan with pockets and you know it
just
just like relaxed and cute where with
leggings where with the tank top
whatever you want great quality very
very happy with it and I just I wear it
around the house too so that is
everything for the clothing I want to
show you guys I have a few accessories
actually these are actually not winter
esque at all most definitely not but
they're new in my life so I wanted to
show them they are these cute little
loafers yellow it's a thing yeah they're
like a mustard a yellow velvet material
and I just love like the little detail
these are from Ray which I get off of
revolve comm but yeah right one of my
favorite shoe brands they're high heels
very very comfortable so yeah I really
like these also I got these two hats
actually yesterday well I was at Urban
Outfitters and I just really liked the
shape of these I feel like they're just
cute right yeah so I'm gonna bring these
back with me when I go to Chicago
because if I were to wear them here it
would literally just be for the fashion
scene which I guess is like a good point
anyways but I got this like caramel
color and then I also got a black shade
so here's that up into it love it next
up I got this belts also from urban
there's a lot of our stuff
I just love funky belts because you can
throw them with very simple outfits and
it just kind of adds it's a little
something-something oh yeah yeah love
the hardware on it it's great
the last accessory is this little purse
it has the shortest little strap so like
the way that you'd wear it is just kind
of like hanging in front of you I love
just like the little reptile kind of
pattern on it and a little lock I just
think it's so cute yeah I would
definitely see this as either like
nighttime bag when you want it to look
just like a little more little preppy er
and girlier or honestly during the day
you just don't need to carry a lot with
you
I never filmed a Black Friday haul but I
did definitely do a little bit of black
friday cyber monday shopping and one of
the packages that i want to share with
you guys was my Bath and Body Works
stuff of course I am a YouTube beauty
guru of course I'm gonna shop on Bath &amp;amp;
Body
expert Black Friday because it's just in
my blood you know so I got a lot of
things okay like you probably should it
buy candles online that you can't smell
in real life because you think it's
gonna smell like one thing and then it
just doesn't smell like that at all so
I'm not anything like bother showing
some of them but I am pleased with this
one this is the white barn rose water
and IV scented candle I don't know when
they started making like cuter candles
but I feel like for a while they just
had this signature like label where you
could see the candle but now they have
these really funky patterns and designs
and I'm all about it this one it smells
very fresh and sweet and light and I
feel like it's really good like kitchen
candle scent so this one I was very
pleased with the others it's okay
we learned also something that I'm
really excited about I feel like I'm
officially an adult you guys because I I
don't know why I refused to look into
these for a very long time we got some
wall flowers well plugins oh these are a
game changer oh my gosh I like I love
burning candles but these you plug them
in you don't have to worry about them
and it just makes your apartment house
room whatever just smell amazing so I
got these two this one for sure isn't
really like a year-round thing but I
thought it was really cute it lights up
when it's plugged in as well and then I
have just like this simpler one so I've
got one upstairs and one downstairs and
right now they both have one of them is
twisted peppermint and then the other
ones like mint mocha or something so
kind of have them complimenting each
other it smells wonderful it's a winter
wonderland in here that's what we're
about love these I don't remember what
deal they were having but it was just
absurd and so I figured I'd stock up at
other cents I don't even think we need
to go through all of them but here's
here's a few focus I don't know it like
makes you mentally focus when you smell
it I guess I'm all about placebos I'm
into it warm vanilla sugar another one
comfort if you want to feel comforting
and then also
Oh some stress relief - if I feel like
stress I've got some almond don't know
how I'm gonna feel about that one but I
feel like it might smell like I'm like
baking or something I picked up some
shower gels fancy we've got coconut mitt
drop it's like it opened yeah I mean it
smells like a coconut mint dropped for
sure oh I'm into that yeah I like that
and then also we've got snowy morning
which really could smell like anything
but ruffles my favourite colour okay
here's that a smart doesn't smell like
winter morning it smells good though so
yeah we got those and then oh also I got
a little hand soap for the kitchen it's
just fresh mint there's a lot of minty
things a lot of lot of fragrances
happening here but I honestly just
thought this one looked really cute and
so I'm excited to put it next to my
kitchen sink lastly I just got a little
body lotion and I thought this jar was
really cute I feel like it just looks
very like old-fashioned it just looks
lovely it looks lovely and so I'll
probably just like put this in the
bathroom but anyways this is from the
aromatherapy line aka the placebo one
maybe it's real amazing
I don't know but this one makes you
sleepy so it's lavender and cedar wood

little winter fashion spa candle scented
