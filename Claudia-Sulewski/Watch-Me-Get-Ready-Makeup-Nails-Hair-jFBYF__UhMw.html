was able to
hey guys so I'm obviously filming this
on a different day because I'm wearing
different makeup but before I end off
today's video I quickly want to talk a
little bit about the nail polishes that
I use in today's video because I
mentioned these in my last favorites
video and I promised you guys that I
would talk a little bit more in depth of
these nail polishes in a future video so
I'm doing that today and also don't mind
my nails because last night I was method
yes Claddagh you were mething I was
messing with a black nail polish because
I was kind of doing stuff to my boots
but anyways that is irrelevant to this
video but yeah so I call you want to
talk about these nail polishes and kind
of do a little short review until you
guys where you can check them out so
they're from the brand silky and this is
how the Box looks there's a bunch of X
on the back and it's magnetic and it's
very cute
so when you open it up it says silky you
are beautiful and it comes with five
nail polishes and then also where'd it
go I don't know where it went but at the
top there was like a little brush it was
very very small it's really good for
making details I seriously had it like a
second ago I don't know work one I
literally have black nail polish
everywhere please excuse my art as far
as my thoughts on these nail polishes
they are really really really good
quality obviously you can tell from the
video that even after one coat is very
pigmented and the yellow one is actually
really really pigmented I was kind of
scared that the yellow one would be kind
of sheared because I feel like lighter
colors are always like sheer and as for
drying time it's kind of average it
doesn't really take to long for the nail
polishes to dry but it doesn't take that
fast either so now I want to list a
couple of the facts about these nail
polishes there's actually a lot of
information on their website and their
website is silky polish calm I'll have
their link in the downbar so that you
can check them out but the page that I'm
on right now looks like this and it
talks about a couple of stuff that I
want to mention so first off the actual
box itself that this can
comes with is printed with soy-based
inks it is also from a recycled material
everything is 100% vegan and silky
polish is five freight and if you don't
know what that means because I had no
idea what it meant they actually have a
page on their website explaining about
it which is what I'm on right now and
what five free means is that silky does
not use five of the toxic ingredients
that a lot of different nail polish
brands use like more like traditional
brands so I'm just going to list you
those five ingredients also the page
that I'm on I will link that in down bar
because when you scroll over all the
ingredients you can read about what they
do and what's bad about them so I know
I'm not going to pronounce these right
because I never do the first one is
formaldehyde the second one is two Lewin
I think it's pronounced I'm not really
sure the third one is DBP the next one
is camphor and the last one is parabens
so yeah you can check out that page down
there and then also these nail polishes
are hypoallergenic pregnancy save
children safe and overall healthier for
you so obviously these nail polishes are
super great for you and for the
environment so I definitely definitely
support this brand I think it's super
great what they're doing so I was very
honored to a try these out and share
them with you guys so that is it for
today's video I'm going to stop talking
now so I hope you guys enjoyed today's
video make sure to check out all the
links I'll have down below and that is
it so I will see you guys in a future
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
