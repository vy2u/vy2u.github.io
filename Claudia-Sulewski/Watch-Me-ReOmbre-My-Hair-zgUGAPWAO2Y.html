my hair and I tweeted out to guys asking
if you guys would like to watch me do it
and a bunch of you guys said yes so
that's what I'm doing today before I get
started I want to kind of brush up on
some history of my hair I hair history
so I bet ombre hair for I think over a
year now and I really like it I like it
because I like having lighter hair but I
hate dyeing my roots I used to be all
blonde and it was just not fun at all
because I do do my hair do do I do my
hair at home and I just really hated
touching up on my roots so ambra hair is
kind of like the lazy way of having
lighter blonder hair so I have not done
my hair I think since January or
December around last winter so all this
right here is my natural hair and this
is obviously bleached at the bottom and
I decided that I wanted to reenter my
hair tonight because I kind of feel like
it's looking a little bit dull right now
there's not very much like dimension
going on it's just kind of like brown
and then like a dirty blonde
so I'm hoping to like adding some more
highlights and stuff and kind of get it
to look more like mixed and stuff I
don't know if that makes sense but I
want to show you guys what I'm using and
all that stuff as well also I made a
video about how I Umbra hair so I'll
leave that linked down below as well as
at the end of the video so I'm not
really going to get into much details in
today's video but you guys will see that
I am very carefree about dyeing my hair
I do not do anything crazy or special I
literally just like take pieces that I
want to dye and just put it on there um
you guys will see I always use the
Revlon defrost and glow by color silk
platinum highlighting kits
I think this kit comes in two or three
different shades it's for like light
medium and dark and this the lightest
one so it looks like this and
in the box you get a little mixing bowl
you also get a little cap where you can
puncture holes into if you want to do it
that way but I just do it freehand you
also get a little mixing spatula this is
the cream developer highlighting powder
which smells awful I remember that this
stuff is like toxic and
Oh
so I finished putting in all my
highlights and I look like a complete
freak right now but I'm gonna go eat
some dinner right now because my dinner
is ready and then I'm gonna come back
and see how like it is
I don't really time how long I like to
keep the bleach in after 30 minutes I
just start checking it every like five
minutes or so and just kind of take it
out when I think it's ready so I'm gonna
let this set in and then I will be right
back so I am going to take them out now
hi guys
so I'm filming this the day after
because last night I wanted to let my
hair air dry because I didn't want to
blow dry it and then it just got really
late and I was too tired to film the end
result but this is what my hair turned
out to look like today I kind of went
for like the Messier look so my hair
looks kind of messy and stuff because I
didn't really brush it but yeah this is
what it looks like so you can see it
didn't turn out as light as I hoped it
would've so I don't think I left it in
long enough but you can see like some of
the lighter pieces like you can see like
the different highlights that I made so
overall I'm very happy with my hair this
is what it looks like with all of it in
front of my shoulders so I'm very happy
it is looking a bit yellow right now I
think it's also because of the lighting
it looks very yellow as what I can see
right now but I am going to go and
purchase some purple shampoo and
conditioner to help kind of tone it out
and take away that brassy like
yellowness that it has to right now once
I do that my hair will look a little bit
more like whiter or cooler I guess you
could say and I think it'll look really
good after that so this is what my hair
turned out to look like that is it for
today's video I hope you guys enjoyed it
and let me know what you guys think
about my hair if you can even tell the
difference I'm
it's very subtle but I'm very happy with
it make sure to thumbs up this video if
you guys enjoy it it helps me out a lot
so I will see you guys in my next video
and that's it bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
