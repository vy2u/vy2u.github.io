read by the title I've dyed my hair
purple oh I'm so in love with it every
single time I look in the mirror I'm
like oh my god it's purple I love it so
much
I just love it so much can you tell that
I love it so much yeah if you guys watch
my last Q&amp;amp;A video then you would know
that I've been wanting to dye my hair
like a pastel like purple on the bottom
for the longest time but I wanted to
wait until senior prom was over so I
don't show up with white purple hair and
my dates parents would be like oh did
you bring to prom so you feel me of
course the day that I got back from my
prom weekend I came home and dad my hair
immediately and of course I had to film
it for you guys because this is such a
dramatic change and a lot of you guys
were also asking on Twitter if I can
make a video about it before we get into
the clips of me dye my hair I quickly
want to state that I am in no way a
professional at this I've been doing my
own hair for as long as I can remember
from cutting it to coloring it so if you
guys have been watching me for a while
I've gone from black hair to blonde hair
to ombre hair to pretty much every
single hair color so why not throw a
purple on to the list
well yeah I'm very happy with the end
result I'm actually filming this a week
after I initially dyed it so it's
definitely been a journey to get to this
point because I have dyed it a few
couple times which I will talk all about
at the end of this video and I ended up
achieving the exact look that I wanted
it's kind of like a silvery violets cool
toned pastel color I've also got a few
lighter kind of blonde pieces in here
which I really like so I am just so
happy with how it turned out and
hopefully you guys like it as well if
you do give this video a thumbs up so
that you can let me know but I'm gonna
stop talking because this intro is
getting way too long so let's get into
the tutorial portion of this video it's
more of a watch me dye my hair purple
for the first time I pretty much have no
idea what I'm doing
that is basically how it is every single
time I do my hair so I did watch a few
YouTube videos and hey since I'm making
such a drastic change
I decided to educate myself on the
Google and YouTube I think I chose some
pretty good products and i fairly know
what i will be doing
I'm a certified show you guys what
products I'll be using and what I
purchased I got this all from Amazon
like a week ago first off I'm going to
be bleaching my hair because obviously
my hair is pretty dark on its own so I
got the L'Oreal high-performance quick
blue powder bleach this would be the
first time I've ever tried one of these
bleaches on my hair so we're just
experimenting with a bunch of new things
today
yeah normally when I lay my hair I use
highlighting kits so this is gonna be
the first time that I'm actually using
like bleach from a container I don't
know if it's any different I really
don't know what I'm doing then of course
you'll be needing a developer to mix
into the bleach this is also from a
L'Oreal it's the 40 volume developer and
yeah that's what looks like let's see
what it smells like this is probably a
bad idea okay next up I bought a toner
because you should always turn your hair
after bleaching it or dyeing it and
basically what this does is it takes out
that yellow brassy kind of tense that
your hair turns into when you bleach it
so I'll be using the Jerome Russell
Punky color hair toner and it just comes
in a little jar does what it looks like
I've never used this bowl my god this
smells lovely mmm
you know those smelly markers this
smells exactly like the grape flavor and
then for the actual hair color I will be
using the Pravana chroma silk Vivid's
long-lasting vibrant colors hair dye
this is in a shade of violence so it
comes in a large tube like this I'm
definitely not going to use this entire
thing probably like a dime sized amount
because I'm going to be mixing it in
with my current conditioner to help
create that pastel effect and delete the
color out let's get this thing started
so I'm just going to start off with one
scoop of the powder take off the
developer
so I'm just gonna pour that much in
uh-huh I'm just gonna slip my hair down
the middle and we're going to do that so
basically what I'm going to do is start
dyeing my hair about two inches up
because I want this to be a little bit
more of a gradual look because it's
ombre so I'm just gonna die about two
inches of it and then go back in and go
a little higher so that the ends have
more bleach time hence they will be
lighter now that I look completely
ridiculous with all this fall in my hair
I am going to play the guessing game and
basically just keep on checking up on
the hair and figuring out what I want to
take it out it's probably gonna be
around 40 minutes to an hour because I
want it pretty light so I'm probably
just gonna be checking it every 20
minutes
ish and then yeah I will get back to you
guys once I take these out so it has
been about 40 minutes ish and now I'm
just gonna take it out and then continue
to add more dye a little bit higher up
the hair I also decided it's probably a
good idea to put on some rubber gloves I
first asked my dad to get this um he
came back with balloons
so as you can see it is super light on
the bottom which I'm very very happy
with so I don't know how I'm gonna go
about this I think I'm just gonna start
kind of making it higher and probably
putting it in foil again just because it
definitely helps to lock in the heat and
kind of speed up the process it's two
days
so here's a closer look at what we've
got at the moment I'm pretty satisfied
with this so I think I'm going to wash
it out yeah this is what it looks like
so I'm gonna go wash it out and hello
update my hair is pretty much completely
dry now as you can see it is a very very
yellow because I have not toned it yet
it is midnight right now so I'm going to
tone and dye my hair purple tomorrow
morning because I just want to go to
sleep and I don't want to wait for it I
think once it's purple it's gonna look a
lot cuter right now it just kind of
strange because it's super yellow but I
was so excited I'm so tired talk to you
later
good morning everyone or at least good
morning for me I just woke up now I'm
gonna go in with my toner and this also
works as a conditioner so all I did last
night was just shampoo the bleach out
and then I just care dry dates
alright I'm gonna leave this in for
about 30 minutes which is the next time
that they recommend it because I am
going purple so might as well keep us on
for as long as I can and yeah then I'm
just gonna wash it out and come back to
you guys hey guys so update it's been a
few hours because I wanted to let my
hair air dry
since I'm damaging it since I'm damaging
it a lot right now I'm trying to stay
away from a heat but now I am ready to
finally put the purple on my hair oh by
the way so this is what my hair turned
out after the toner and I feel like it's
showing up a lot more yellow on camera
just because I'm wearing a white shirt
so it's like kind of bumping up the
contrast if that makes sense
honestly I probably should have kept the
toner in for a little bit longer and
apply it on a little bit more but I
think this is this will be fine
to create a pastel purple I'm going to
be mixing it into a bowl with some
conditioner and this is the head and
shoulders a green apple conditioner this
stuff is my brothers I took it out of
the shower because I didn't feel like
using mine it's expensive okay basically
you just want to pour as much
conditioner as you think you will need
to cover however much hair you're going
to be covering is that enough maybe a
little more maybe a little more - I
don't know what I'm doing it's enough
right no so that's got to be enough I
mean yeah come maybe not
sorry Kevin
just gonna add some more alright okay no
this is definitely enough also this
bottle does not have any directions on
it which is great of course so I'm gonna
start off by putting the smallest amount
because oh that might have been too much
is this stuff yeah this stuff is super
bright alright so as you can see that
one little dot created this so that was
definitely too much Wow okay I'm really
surprised I will be right back oh my
gosh I love saying blonde at the bottom
because I miss having ombre hair so much
um so what I'm going to do is just grab
a little bit of this pour it into this
bowl and add some more conditioner to
lighten up the color here is the first
of all that we made so that you can see
a difference of how much lighter I
wanted it so I think this is a good
shade it's like a very very pastel
purple I've heard that the color lasts a
long a long time so I'd rather just play
it safe and make it light now and then
if I wanted a little darker I could add
some more in but I think this is a good
starting color it's just a very light
lilac violet purple whatever you want to
call it I think I'm going to apply it in
two different sections kind of like how
I bleach my hair and wrapping it in tin
foil to kind of control the mess let's
do this
so that was all the footage that I had
of me dyeing my hair but like I
mentioned in the intro of this video I
did take a couple steps afterwards to
get to this color so first starters when
I applied on the lighter shade of the
dye because I had two different cups
I had the darker one and the lighter one
after using the lighter one it did not
come out as vibrant on my hair as I
wanted it to be so I ended up taking the
darker one which is kind of like a
medium bright purple and apply that onto
my ends after doing that my hair ended
up looking like this so as you can tell
it was a little bit darker than what my
hair looks like right now and I kind of
feel like it turned out a little Pinker
which was really weird but that is how
my hair turned out I kept it like that
for about a week until yesterday morning
I read add my hair because since you're
deleting the dye with so much
conditioner it starts to fade as you
take more showers which is completely
normal
although I have heard that this hair dye
tends to stay a lot longer than other
brands just a side note to point out so
it did start to fade a little bit more
than my liking so yesterday morning I
took the same exact hair conditioner and
hair dye and created a color that was a
little bit darker than the first one
that I used and a little bit lighter
than the one that I used afterwards so
overall it was just a lighter purple
then I used a week ago and this is what
my hair turned out to look like which is
kind of like a silvery purple if you
guys have any questions about the
process that it took to get to this
color then please leave them down in the
comments below and I'll try to answer as
many as I can and that is pretty much it
for today's video I hope you guys
enjoyed it like I said before let me
know if you guys like the color I
personally love it so much because
purple has always been my favorite color
and I just it's so fun I love choosing
outfits that match with my hair now and
switching up my makeup to make it look
funky with my hair and it's just been a
wonderful experience so far so I hope
you guys enjoyed today's video and I'll
see you guys for a new one very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
