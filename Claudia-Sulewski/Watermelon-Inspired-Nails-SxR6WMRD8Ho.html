definitely watermelons so why didn't
make a nail tutorial out of it this
one's going to be really really fast and
easy it takes about two minutes to
complete so I'm sure everyone can do
this one so I hope you enjoy
so first you guys start out by grabbing
your favorite pink or red nail polish
and I'm going to be using this very baby
pink nail polish and you're just going
to apply it all over the nails so once
your nails have dry to grab any white
nail polish I'm just using one from what
in wild I honestly don't know what shade
it is because everything like peeled off
but basically what you're going to do is
just make a line at the top of your nail
so basically like you're doing a French
manicure except make it a little bit
thicker than normal because we're going
to be putting a color over that and
letting the white show through at the
bottom
so once you've none of that your nails
should look something a little bit like
this of course let them dry so once
they're completely dried then just grab
any green nail polish and I'm using one
pin sense of colors and it is in the
shade San Francisco and basically what
you do that nail polish is you create a
line at the top of your nail right on
top of that white but you want to make
sure that you leave a little bit of the
white showing underneath and you might
have to take more than one coat to get
that bright green color so I to do like
two coats something so yeah so once
you've given your nail some time to dry
you're going to start out by grabbing a
black nail polish and this is just one
from white wet'n'wild any hard surface
that you don't care about getting messy
and some dotting tools so starting out
with the biggest dotting tool I'm just
going to start making random black dots
in the little pink area and I'm just
kind of randomly placing these on so
it's wondering and then after that I
took a smaller dotting tool and I made
more dots and i like to use different
sizes for the tools because they'll kind
of give a little bit more of like a
girly or effect on your nails and
afterwards i'm going to be using a
toothpick which is going to make the
tiniest sized dots so you'll see that
too
oh and by the way i recorded this video
when i had no power or internet at my
house so I didn't realize until like
this morning that there are many
tutorials out there that are really
similar to these nails so I'm sorry if
you have seen something like this before
I really didn't like know that anyone do
this so yeah I wasn't really trying to
copy anyone so I just want to put that
out there but yeah that's basically it
so just put on your top coat and you're
done so I hope you guys enjoyed today's
jor-el all right bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
