for today's video I'm going to be doing
something a little bit different I've
never done this before
but I have seen people do this so that's
what kind of sparked this idea today I'm
going to be doing a what I ate today
video which is basically where I go
through my entire day with you guys
eating wise so I show you what I eat for
breakfast lunch dinner blah blah blah so
I actually filmed all of my meals
yesterday so you'll be able to see
everything but I did not include how
much water I'm drinking and how much tea
I'm drinking if I did this video would
be about 30 minutes long but I like to
drink at least 1 liter of water every
single day and I also drink like 1,000
cups of tea so just keep that in mind
I'm drinking a lot of liquids as I'm
eatin this stuff also as you will be
watching this video you may notice that
I'm trying to eat a lot healthier
recently so maybe this video will
inspire some of you guys to eat a little
bit healthier as well so that's about it
this intro really had no purpose but
let's get into it
for breakfast I decided to go with some
oatmeal so I am using my Quaker Oats
quick one-minute heart-healthy oatmeal
and I'm just using half a cup of that
dry then adding in as much water as I
want and we're going to be heating this
up in the microwave for about 1 minute
and 30 seconds
after that I like to sweeten mine with
some stevia extract then lastly I'm
adding in some cut up strawberries
raspberries and blackberries for lunch
I'm having some sweet potatoes with
turkey bacon which is so good oh my god
you guys need to try this so I'm
starting off by peeling and cutting up
these sweet potatoes into big chunks
either use one large one or two smaller
ones then I just cover them up in a damp
paper towel and place it in the
microwave for about 2 and 1/2 minutes
after that I like to grab the turkey
bacon I like to use 2 slices and I get
mine from Trader Joe's and I'm just
going in with a knife and cutting them
into little squares once I've cut up my
turkey bacon I like to cook it on medium
heat on a frypan and I normally like to
use nonstick spray but I didn't have any
so I had to use olive oil but I'm just
going in and spreading them out so that
they evenly cook I've recently come up
with the most genius idea ever comment
down below and let me know if any of you
guys also do this but once the potatoes
are done cooking in the microwave I just
put them into the nutribullet and it
perfectly comes out in a mashed
consistency and it's amazing I do it
every single time and it's great you
guys should definitely do it if you
don't so after that I just throw in my
bacon bits and that's basically it I
just mix it around and enjoy it's really
good because it's salty but sweet at the
same time
I love snacking on smaller meals
throughout the day so my first snack by
the way can we talk about how cute this
bowl is I just want to show you guys
many ways shout out to Megan ranks
because I'm completely obsessed with
frozen mangoes because of her so what I
do is just throw a couple more than a
couple actually and thaw them in the
microwave for about 30 seconds and
that's all you have to do but it is the
best snack in the entire world I'm
obsessed
for my second snack I love eating
esteemed vegetables so today I decide to
go with some Brussels sprouts and I just
followed the directions on the back so
I'm just going to be steaming them in
the microwave and once that's done I
just pour them into a bowl and I
sprinkle them with garlic salt guys if
you haven't tried this yet it is so good
I literally put it on everything it's so
good but that's all I have to do yeah
and Brussels sprouts are awesome
they're great
shrimp isn't the healthiest thing in the
entire world but I was definitely in the
mood for some so I just cooked a handful
of shrimp and threw that over two and a
half cups of baby spinach and used some
zesty Italian dressing this salad is
super easy but it tasted really good so
I had that for dinner now lastly for
dessert I'm starting off by making my
peanut butter out of pb2 powder which is
a healthy alternative to peanut butter
it has 85 percent less fat calories so I
just mix that in with some water and
pair that up with a small Honey Crisp
apple
so that is it for today's video be sure
to like it if you guys want me to make
more videos like this I thought it was
really fun and different but I will see
you guys for a new video very soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
