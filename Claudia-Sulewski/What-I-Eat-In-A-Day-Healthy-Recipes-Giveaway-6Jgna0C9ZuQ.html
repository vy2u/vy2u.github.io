channel today's video is gonna be a
little what I eat a day recipe type
video also stick to the end of this
video if you want to find out how to win
all of the things that you see in this
picture right here I'm doing a little
Instagram giveaway it's gonna be super
easy to enter into and I'll have my
Instagram that link down below let's get
into the video we're gonna start off our
morning with some green waffles these
are basically just oatmeal waffles which
are super super easy to make and so
healthy for you but we're gonna add in
some spinach to make them a little
healthier and a little more green so I
don't really measure them out every
single time it's always a little
different but you just throw all the
ingredients into a blender I like to use
a nutribullet because then I can pour it
straight into the little waffle maker
but yeah don't worry about the spinach
tasting like anything because if your
banana is ripe enough it masks any taste
and the waffles end up super sweet so
I'm just pouring the batter into my
waffle maker if you don't own one you
can totally make these into pancakes and
you know once it beeps you pull them out
and then I like to pair it with any type
of fruit that I have bananas
strawberries blueberries whatever and
then of course you got a drizzle some
maple syrup on top try to go organic
stay away from that Aunt Jemima stuff
this is where this is where the good
stuff is and those my waffles so for
lunch time I more commonly actually just
order food or if I'm already you know
running around doing errands grabbing
lunch with someone but it's usually the
middle of the day when I'm most busy and
things are most hectic so I don't have
time to cook all day every day so here
I'm just show you guys a poke a bowl
that I love to get it's super healthy
you've got your carbs to give you fuel
your protein all that stuff I'm obsessed
I probably get it way too much
apart from my main meals I wanted to
mention that I'm constantly snacking
throughout the day whether I have
fresh-cut fruit laying around in the
kitchen or carrots vegetables bars
whatever but yeah I usually snack on
after all today not lastly it for my
warm dinner salad I basically just had a
bunch of random vegetables left over in
the fridge so I had to figure out what
to do with them so I'm just washing up
my zucchini and mushrooms and dicing
them up as well as an onion now I'm
placing them into a bowl to quickly
season them up before throwing them on
the pan so I like to drizzle a little
bit of olive oil some seasoning some
pepper a little bit of salt and kind of
mix that up and then yeah I just throw
that onto the pan and then I will use
that same bowl to then season some
chicken and so I'll use pretty much the
same stuff but I'll also squeeze in some
fresh lemon and yeah you know just kind
of do that whole thing so I'll just cook
everything up over medium heat into
separate pans and then also I had some
leftover frozen rice cauliflower so I
just threw that in last minute and then
while those are finishing up I am just
placing some mixed greens on this cute
little plate bowl that I'm obsessed with
and then drizzling some balsamic
vinaigrette mixing that up and it kind
of gives us a nice little salad bed if I
do say for our warm vegetables and
chicken and so it's like a warm salad
type dish I make these all the time it's
just an easy way to incorporate greens
when you're also just eating like a warm
entree and so that is my dinner lastly I
love drinking any sort of lattes or tea
at night so today I'm going to show you
guys how to make a golden latte or
tumeric latte so I'm just starting off
with almond milk and then some ground
ginger tumeric obviously ground cinnamon
and then some raw unfiltered honey and
so I like to start off by heating up the
almond milk in a little saucer pan over
some medium to low fire and you'll see
that I pour quite a bit of all the
ingredients in there because I later
filter through it before pouring it into
the cup and so I like to you know get
the flavors in there get the benefit of
everything also pro tip definitely crack
a little bit of pepper in there because
that will help the tumeric to like
active
your system or something scientific like
that so I'm just throwing that
everything in there heating up the milk
and whisking it up it takes literally no
time at all and then here I go with the
filter also I was spilling everywhere
because I tried to make the shot look
cute and it was an awkward angle and
this is what happens when you have to
film this stuff but you guys can see how
much of the chunks I filtered out and
then yeah I poured some cinnamon on top
and that is it oh look who made it all
the way to the end of the video I want
to do a really simple and small giveaway
