my Christmas haul and I love filming
these videos I've been filming Christmas
hauls for the past two years and I seem
to get really great feedback from them I
think they're really fun to watch and
really fun to film so I definitely want
to film this video for you guys this
year because I've been getting so many
requests to do it and I'm just so happy
with everything that I got for Christmas
I'm so thankful and this is definitely
one of the best Christmases ever for me
for those of you who have seen my past
Christmas hauls you may have noticed
that I normally just asked for one or
two things and then I just kind of let
Santa surprise me for the rest just
because I think it's more fun that way
when I don't know what I'm getting this
year I specifically asked for one thing
and I got it and I was so so happy and
excited when I opened it up it is the
iPad Mini I've always wanted an iPad but
I just never really was sure if I wanted
one and then when I saw the iPad Mini
come out I knew that it was just for me
because it is the perfect size of fits
in one hand and sorry it's going off but
this is what it looks like it is
absolutely beautiful this is what it
looks like I haven't really downloaded a
very many apps yet but I've been
basically playing with this all day and
I just in love with this this is like
the best person that I've ever gotten
every Christmas so that's my main
present I'm very very excited about that
then I got to I guess you could say
beauty related gifts the first one it's
just an urban decay primer potion it was
actually perfect timing because I'm
almost out of the
I'm currently using and you can see like
how beat-up and gross this looks so yeah
I was really excited to see this because
it is my all-time favorite primer I'm
sure you guys have tried this out
because it is such an overhyped and
talked about product but if you haven't
it's a really great primer and the next
thing that I got which I was so excited
and surprised to get because I've never
specifically asked for this but it's
always kind of been in the back of my
mind and it is the Daisy Marc Jacobs
perfume this perfume smells so good oh
my gosh yes so I was completely
surprised I literally had no idea that I
would get this and yeah this is what the
bottom looks like it just it smells very
classic and girly and feminine and
florally for sure um and it just it
smells so good I feel like it's more of
a mature sweet smell so this is
definitely different from anything else
I own and I mainly own like fruity viva
la juicy like Victoria's Secret perfumes
and stuff so this is going to be a great
addition to my perfume collection and
I'm just so happy that I got this I
literally no idea complete surprise then
I just got two more things for Christmas
and they are both the Victoria's Secret
and I actually kind of had a feeling
that I would get these because I was
shopping with my mom and I was trying
them on so she knew exactly what to get
me which was perfect yeah they are both
workout clothing items the first one is
this black little crop tank from pink
and I think this would be great for yoga
because my normally wear sports bras for
yoga because I don't really have like
workout shirts so I think this is cool
because it's kind of like a half shirt
half sports bra cause it's like corrupt
so I was very excited to get that and
then I also got these running shorts and
I love running in these I even do yoga
in these sometimes and I just love
lounging in these as well so this is my
first pair of Victoria's Secret running
short so I thought these were super cute
and they are very very comfortable so
that is
thing that I got for Christmas this year
and I was very happy it's definitely one
of the best Christmases that I've had
especially with the iPad I was so happy
to get that so if you guys are planning
on filming what you got for Christmas
hauls then just post it down below and I
will be happy to watch it because I love
watching these videos and I also don't
want you guys to take this video the
wrong way I don't want you to think that
I'm trying to brag or anything but these
videos are just really requested and I
just I like filming them a lot I think
they're fun make sure to check out my
holiday nail tutorial that I recently
posted for the wintertime I actually
have it on my nails right now and I
don't have it on this hand I filmed it
at two men but I didn't feel like doing
it on the other hand so yeah this is
this is what happens when I film nail
tutorials but yeah and then I also
filmed an eye makeup tutorial for the
holidays too so I will have those linked
in the downbar in case you want to check
those out so that is it and I will talk
to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
