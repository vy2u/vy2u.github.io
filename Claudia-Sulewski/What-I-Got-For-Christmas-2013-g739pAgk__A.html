of you who celebrate it and if not happy
holidays I hope you guys have been
enjoying your winter break today I'm
going to be filming at my what I got for
Christmas video because I do these every
year and you guys seem to really enjoy
them and it's also super requested so
that's what I'm doing today I normally
like to ask for only one or two gifts
and then I just let Santa kind of figure
the rest out I think it just makes it
more exciting for me I like being
surprised on Christmas day with presents
that I didn't expect so that's what I
like to do this year I asked for two
main presents and I received both of
them so I was very happy so let's just
get right into it the first thing that I
asked for this year take this hair out
oh wait okay was the jawbone up Fitness
band which I have on my wrist right now
for those of you who have been keeping
up with vlogmas this year which is where
you vlog every single day until
Christmas
you would know that I've recently just
really gotten into eating healthy and
working out because it's fun for me and
it makes you feel amazing
so I have been eyeing this product for
the longest time it's a fitness band
that does a lot of different things so
for one it's a pedometer so it counts
how many steps you're taking throughout
the day it also connects with an app on
your iPhone or Android so you can create
goals for yourself it also shows you how
many steps you should be taking on
average this thing also tracks your
sleeping patterns so it tells you how
long you've been in deep sleep and light
sleep or slurring my words it just does
a lot of things so if you guys want me
to do a review on this fitness band
after a few weeks of using it I
definitely well because so far I've been
loving it I've been using it for like a
day so this is the first thing that I
received which I'm so happy that I got
because I just love this kind of stuff
the second gift I asked for this year
was the Daisy a Marc Jacobs oh so fresh
perfume I hope I'm pronouncing that
right but it's spelled EI u so I just ex
for the perfume but I got this gift
little set right here which was a
surprise so when you open it up once I
open it up almost dropped it
it looks like this so you get three
different things so first off I got to
be perfume and I think this is the
largest size so this thing is going to
last me forever it smells very fresh and
light and flowery and it's just the
perfect scent for the spring and
summertime it smells divine it's so I
got this perfume in here it also came
with a mini little size for traveling to
throw in your bag and lastly I got the
radiant body lotion that matches with
the perfume so that's also really nice
so those are the two main gifts that I
got from Santa this year now everything
else are just random little
miscellaneous things so my family knows
that I'm obsessed with tea I drink it
all day every day so I got a few tea
related things so first off I got three
different teas and I'm excited to try
these out because I've never heard or
used this brand before and it is the
wuyi tea company and these teas are
actually pretty funny so they're not
meant to be taken seriously or anything
like I don't know if my family is trying
to hint to me that I need to like lose
weight or something but no I'm just
kidding but my mom was laughing when I
was opening these up she was saying how
you know during the holidays you're
eating all this junk food and sweets and
stuff so you know what why not drink in
ultra cleanse to a home so I'll start
off with this one at first off I got the
Apple Cinnamon Ultra cleanse too and
basically what it does is it promotes
colon cleansing it also flushes out
toxins and restores balance in your body
I'm guessing so I got that one next up I
got the cocoa latte chocolate drink tea
which just sounds heavenly so I'm really
excited to try this one but this one
booster energy increases metabolism and
it has lots of antioxidants in it so
sold me the last tea I received was the
diet's control a peppermint twist I'm
not going on a diet guys don't worry
but this tea at boost energy increases
your metabolism and aids
digestion so yeah so I got those three
T's and to go along with those I also
received this little metal tumbler from
Starbucks which is the cutest little
thing because it fits right in my hand
and it's like a silver and bronze
metallic color which is nice so it's
very durable this will be great for
on-the-go to carry my tea in and place
the little card thing so this is really
cute next up my brother got me some
signature truffles from God Devia
I bought your like every single brand
name so I'm sorry about that but I've
basically just been picking at these and
eating them for the past 48 hours not
gonna show you what it looks like inside
yeah it looks like a bear attacked these
but these chocolates are probably the
best chocolates that I've ever tried
this brand is actually pretty expensive
and fancy so I was really excited about
those though Thank You quezon next up I
received two pillows from Anthropologie
which was a complete surprise I did not
see this coming at all
but they probably won't fit in the
screen the first one is just a white
fluffy square and the second one is a
rectangle and I was given these to use
in my future apartment because I will be
moving out next year these will go
really well with the apartment and
they're really fluffy and and
anthropology is like my favorite
strawberry so that's just an extra plus
so that is everything that I received on
Christmas morning but I wanted to show
you guys one more gift from my cousin
Daria I'm sure bunch of you guys know of
her from my vlogmas videos and my second
channel but I wanted to show you guys
the gift that she gave me because I am
so obsessed with it and I just love
everything she got me
I just really love when people put in as
so much thought and meaning into their
gifts and they buy you things that they
know you will use a lot and really
appreciate and I seriously love
everything in this game so I wanted to
show it to you guys first off she got me
to a bralette switch
I wear bra less all the time I don't
even remember what real bras are but the
first one I got is this navy blue lacy
bra that it's super comfortable because
it has a thicker strap on it she also
got me at this bright blue floral like
triangle-shaped bra which is really cute
these are both from Keeley Hicks and she
got me at some matching underwear with
it how adorable the next gift she gave
me I was not expecting at all but I was
so happy to see it in here because we've
been talking about this for the longest
time and it's just one of those gifts
that I will be using so often and I've
just been really needing it and they are
training gloves because as I mentioned
before we've been really getting into
working out I pretty much go to the gym
with Daria every single day if not every
other day and we like to work on the
like weight machines and work on our
arms and stuff and it's very easy to get
blisters on your hands so that's why
training gloves are really helpful with
avoiding that but she just got me at the
Nike women's fundamental training gloves
which I'm so excited I'm just going to
look like such a little bit with these
in the gym next up she got me a Bath and
Body Works candle and this is in the
scent champagne toast
which smells so good it smells a little
bit like champagne but it also has like
a fruity hint to it I was very happy to
receive this candle it smells so freakin
good
next up Daria got me a few tea related
things of course so first off she got me
two loose teas from Teavana which is one
of my favorite tea companies ever the
first one she gave me it was the cocoa
caramel sea salt which is funny because
that exact day like the morning before
that night I bought this same exact tea
for myself because I've already tried
before and I'm seriously obsessed
so I was not complaining at all that she
got me this tea because the more the
better so I really loved that and she
also got me the chocolate decadence tea
as well which sounds really good to go
along with those she got me these two
little tins which are so adorable and
they're all so cute because they're
already labels on the bottom so I know
exactly what T I'm going to be drinking
so these are just so cute and these are
used to keep the tea brush any last gift
which I'm so excited about is this
little tea cup right here from Teavana
and excited about this because I've just
recently started getting into loose teas
normally I just get the tea bags but
this one is perfect because it comes
with a little mesh basket that separates
the tea from the hot water so this is
great for individual servings because I
only have like a tea pot that I can use
so the fact that this only makes one cup
is perfect for me
and it comes with a little cap to steam
or flip the thing brew whatever the term
is so I just thought this was so
adorable and I'm probably gonna use this
like this I cannot turn off the camera
so that is everything that I received
for Christmas this year and I'm very
happy Santa did well so I hope you guys
received everything that you wish for
and not to get all cheesy on you guys
but I'm very thankful for all of you
because recently you guys have just been
so kind in the comment sections and you
all seem to really be enjoying my vlogs
and my new videos which just makes me so
happy and that's what Christmas is all
about
so I hope you guys enjoyed today's video
I will be sure to leave a link down
below of my vlogmas playlist because
today it was the last one this video
that I uploaded which is so sad but if
any of you guys want to see what I did
every single day for the past 25 days
then I will leave day 1 in there and
it'll be a playlist so the videos will
just play right after another
automatically so if you guys want to
check that out that will be down there
but I hope you guys enjoyed today's
video and I will see you guys later
