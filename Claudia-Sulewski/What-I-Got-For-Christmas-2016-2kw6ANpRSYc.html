channel if you're wondering where I am
right now I'm actually back home in
Chicago for the holidays just like all
of the previous years I decided to film
a what I got for Christmas video due to
so many requests from you guys on
Twitter and Instagram and my blog
comments so I do want to apologize about
the fact that I don't have any great
lighting setup also the only camera that
I have with me is my canon g7x vlogging
camera so the quality is not that good
is it even focused on my face who knows
and I'm also a little sick so we've
we've got some complications but it's
all right before I start this video
obviously I do want to mention that this
is not me trying to brag about all the
stuff that I got you guys just love
seeing these videos and you asked for
them and I think everyone has that
little part in them that super nosy and
wants to know when everyone buys and
stuff so I'm so down to show you guys
and just be able to express my
thankfulness and appreciation for this
stuff because it was a good Christmas
and I'm so happy with everything that I
got so thank you so much to all my
friends and family and stuff for these
things okay so we're gonna start off
with my main Christmas present the
biggest one the one that I'm probably
most excited about I don't know how my
mom does this but every single year she
somehow pulls through and buys me
something that even I didn't know I
wanted it's one of those things where
you get it and you're like oh my god you
actually read my mind before I read by
on mine
and that would have to be my first pair
of Louboutins oh my goodness so this is
what they look like they're just your
classic black pointy toed heels and so
they've got the red bottoms I actually
like this style because the red kind of
peeks out a little bit more on the side
and right here and they fit great and
they're so comfortable and I'm so so
freaking happy with these these are the
' pump 100 Napa shiny that is the style
of these my jaw basically dropped four
or five minutes when I opened these I
was so excited next up I got two
different perfumes one is a refill of a
perfume that i've been using for so many
years it's one of my go to and another
is a newer one that i've never
try it and I'm so happy with it they'll
start off with the og one people love
Juicy noir if you guys have been
following for a while then you would
know how much I love this perfume which
is funny because when you think of Viva
La Juicy perfume I feel like that's what
every girl wore in middle school early
high school it was like that classic
girly sugary smell but I'm telling you
the new r1 is so freakin underrated no
one knows about it no one wears it and
it smells so freakin good it's kind of
cheesy because it's hot pink and as a
black bow but I like to wear this most
when I'm going out whether it's you know
on the weekends or I'm dressing up maybe
it's because the word noir is in it
that's probably part of it but this is
definitely like my going-out smell next
up I got my first ever Chanel perfume
which was very exciting I actually got
the original number five and I've never
smelt it before surprisingly but when I
opened it up it was a little bit too
strong and mature for me I definitely
like lighter scents that are more fresh
maybe floral or citrus that one just
smelled too like woodsy but I got a
sample of the number 5 blue lei Lu I'm
probably not pronouncing that right but
it's spelled le au
I got a sample this one and I fell in
love with it it's basically an updated
version of the number 5 so it has the
number 5 as a base still inside of it
but also sense of citrus we're thrown in
and so the reason why I love this one is
because it's a lot lighter it's a lot
fresher definitely more of a youthful
scent but yeah the bottle is absolutely
stunning this is definitely going to be
like my everyday perfume when I'm going
out during the day and stuff it's a lot
more inexpensive than the original and
too I had a smaller bottle the original
that was probably half of this and it
was double the price of this large one
which is crazy so yeah after Christmas I
switched out the perfumes because I knew
that I would use this one more those are
the two perfumes I got which is so
exciting because that's never something
that I purchased myself next up I got
quite possibly the coolest bracelet in
the entire world
this bracelet actually came all the way
from Poland from my mom's brother and
it's by the brand
yes which I've never heard of but
this thing is so cool I'm just gonna
show it up here like ogee YouTube style
it's basically a silver bracelet that is
a zipper and the entire thing unzips and
zips which is so cool ah it's so badass
I'm so so excited about this one
and yeah you guys know how I feel about
silver everything I own every jewelry
piece is always silver damn I'm sorry I
feel like my energy is so low right now
but it's straight up because I'm getting
sick next up I got two face products
which is always so much fun because I
love trying out different things for my
face these are by the same brand it's
called a soap wait a soft a eso P but
there's a facial cleanser and an
antioxidant serum so I've actually been
trying out this one for the past few
days it's got grape seed in it and
parsley seed it's a daily use serum
moisturizer for normal to combination
skin and what I have found that I like
about this is a it's a very relaxing
smell very moisturizing and it's a lot
thicker than the serum that I currently
am using every single day having to go
outside through the cold Chicago weather
and the extremely dry air in this house
having a thicker serum has been quite
amazing so I'm really excited to try the
facial cleanser as well but those are
fun and then the last thing that I got
is so funny the packaging says to
Claudia from devil interesting in here
I got a nice little matching skirt to my
new shoes this skirt is by the brand
Donna Karen and it's like a black tie
pencil skirt actually I haven't tried
this on yet so hopefully it fits but I
think it will I think it's gonna look
good the last thing that I want to show
you guys are actually two items that I
purchased myself because you know Santa
Claus has to please everybody I spent a
day in the city with Lauren and she
showed me the cutest store ever called
4-sided if you live in Chicago check it
out they have the cutest stationery
pencils greeting cards wall decor all
that stuff so so cute and funny and I
found this little what would you call
this wall decal poster thing anyways I
thought it was really cute it's a
Chicago style and then you've got the
hotdog and all the
SiC toppings and stuff and so I thought
this would be really cute to frame and
throw onto the wall I want to get more
stuff and this just reminds me where I
came from and I think it's adorable and
then we've got the big boy the Big Mama
I got myself a little backpack oh my
goodness I'm so obsessed it's by the
brand Gucci and it's just a cute little
neutral backpack and what I loved most
about it is that has a super athletic
looking back and straps yeah I'm
probably just going to be using this for
running errands and shopping and the
reason why I liked it is because it will
definitely match to everything I could
straight-up be wearing like a workout
top and yoga leggings and it'll work
it'll be a very versatile backpack so
I'm very very happy about this so those
are all the things that I got for
Christmas this year and I am so so happy
with everything comment down below and
let me know what you guys got and yeah
if you're watching this before the New
Year's then Happy New Year's I hope you
spend it with the people that you love
and have a great safe time what do you
want for me is that a scream thank you

girlfriend just now realizing this is my
