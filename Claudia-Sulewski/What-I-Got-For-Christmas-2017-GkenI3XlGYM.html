channel today we are doing what I got
for Christmas 2017 I feel like I'm kind
of filming this late I'm filming this on
the 1st of January happy 2018 by the way
I hope you guys all had a very fun and
safe New Year's Eve I'm feminie was
kinda late because I wanted to wait
until I was here so that I would have
you know like nice lighting and
everything so I just brought everything
home with me and I'm gonna show you guys
also if like my hair or makeup looks a
little whack I just came back from like
a little weekend trip and we're in a two
hour car ride and I did this this
morning in a very low bathroom so I
don't really know what's happening on
the screen but it's fine I feel like I
just need to get these out of the way
penis lollipop I probably will eat one
eventually and thanks mom
okay let's get into the actual stuff the
present that I'm most excited about
which is something that and my brother
Kevin got me I did drop a little hint
and tell him that I wanted this cuz I've
been wanting to get this for so long and
he got it for me and I'm so happy and it
is this guy kind of looks like a
scientific test tube but it actually
makes coffee this is a chemist you put a
filter on this little top part right
here you scoop in your ground coffee
pour boiling water through it and
basically it just filters fresh coffee
and yeah I've been using it I'm obsessed
with it I think it's so cute I am so
over my super shitty Keurig that makes
super diluted coffee so I'm excited to
get rid of that and just have this guy
and also I just think it looks so cute
it's a fun process super super happy
that he got me filters because I was
able to enjoy this immediately and
basically again just had these little
paper filters you fold it up in a
certain way and you make it coffee with
that he also got me this little guy and
basically you can just have your creamer
and sugar in here and I think that's so
cute
so I'm gonna have these next to each
other and like put something in here
also following the coffee theme he got
me some ground Christmas blend coffee
from Starbucks and this stuff it smells
and tastes so good so I've just been
using this every day and so we got that
by the way all of that is from Creighton
barrel basically I just kind of sent him
links to stuff and also I asked for
metal straws because I had rose gold
ones and they started getting rusty and
chipped I was asked for some simple I
just stay myself super stoked about
these because we're helping the
environment the last thing that my
brother got me is a book and he listened
to this as an audiobook and he got super
into it loved it so he bought it for me
he didn't realize that this book was
written by Stephenie Meyer who also
wrote the Twilight series and so he was
listening to this and I think one of his
friends was like yeah you realize like
those were the Twilight books anyways so
that sold me because I loved Twilight
and he was like yeah apparently there's
a romance portion in this book or aspect
to it and he said that him being like a
24 year old guy actually really enjoyed
it so that makes me happy if it's called
the chemist comment down below if you
guys have read this before but don't
spill anything but let me know if you
enjoyed it I'm really enjoying it so far
I think it's super creative I also got
another book and I think this my mom
picked out but it just called cocktails
and modern favorites to make at home
from williams-sonoma I keep hitting
myself in the face super excited about
this because I love making like
different drinks and stuff and trying
stuff out haven't done that in a while
also these recipes sound insane like let
me find oh my gosh coconut cream and
lime margarita light lemon rosemary
Moscow Mule blackberry lemon a whiskey
sour I am so excited continuing on with
kitchen stuff also from williams-sonoma
I got these two serving dishes at first
I thought they were decor pieces but
then my mom informed me and she was like
no no no no no you can put food in these
and salads and feed people out of these
bowls yeah we got these two and they're
super cool shape they're kind of like
rounded and shiny but then they have
like the brushed metal on the inside
this would be a good like salad bowl or
like chips guac you feel me
next up I got an ornament because my mom
collects ornaments she
there's some that are like over 20 years
old it's insane the cool thing about our
Christmas tree is that it always is very
funky shaped but also it has such a
collected 5 because all of our ornaments
are so weird and intricate and they're
all glass and beautiful and handcrafted
and I just think it looks so cool so I
know when I'm older I kind of want to
start that same tradition where every
single year I just keep adding to the
collection my mother got me my first
official one I'm waiting until I like
live in a house to start getting real
trees for now I'm just kind of dealing
with like a fake twinkle tree because
I'm too lazy and but this one is so
pretty she got me a little London to
Necker bus because my oldest brother
Marcin moved to London this year and so
this was our first Christmas without him
which was so sad we were literally
facetiming him while opening our gift so
it felt like he was kind of there but
anyways she got me a little London bus
ornament to kind of have a piece of
Morrison with us next up I did a little
gift exchange with my cousin Nicole and
she got me this little cropped hoodie
that I want to show because I love it it
says a d-does on the front and back and
then it's got like a slight turtleneck
vibe which I don't own a lot of
turtlenecks so I was actually really
excited
anything cropped I'm in I'm a fan yep
so yeah I ended up actually wearing this
on Christmas Day this necks cutest bunny
it's from my dad and it's like such a
dad gift like when I opened it first of
all he's been obsessed with this and
raving about it and so I'm surprised
that I didn't like guests that I was
gonna get this so my dad got me a nest
camera security camera he's been
obsessed with these I think we have two
back at home and like it connects to an
app on your phone and it records if you
know anyone breaks in or whatever
anyways so he gave me one and don't know
where I'm gonna put it if I should put
on the balcony or like the front door
I'm not sure this is just gonna be very
useful to have eventually when I live in
a house and all that stuff so yeah I
just love it it was just like such a dad
gift
oh we loved ads ooh okay this is a
present that I actually bought for
myself I guess as a Christmas gift we
were shopping at the Rosemont outlet
mall if any of you guys are familiar
with the Chicago area lots of outlets
like high-end stores and stuff and it
was great we went into Barney's and I
found this little car a backpack I love
the brand Cara I just love how simple
all the pieces are and I have this like
little nude crossbody bag that I use all
the time anyways I got this backpack and
it's so bright so colorful and funky and
I love it I love the quality of their
pieces and they have a nice little
pocket back here yeah it's like a pretty
jade green kind of pebble leather and
yeah so I got that also this was crazy
on sale I think it started off as like
$450 and I got it on sale for 150 so I
got $300 off that's insane I've only got
two more things to show you guys and
this is definitely like the main present
of the year and I am so so happy about
them well actually quick back story my
mom got me a Gucci wallet and it was
beautiful it was like a bigger really
nice wallets but I don't really need a
big wallet because my purses are usually
pretty tiny and so I just have like this
little you know like keychain like
clutch thing that I use anyways so we
actually went back to the store and I
returned to the wallet and exchanged it
for two belts it was a pricey wallet but
I'm so happy with these belts and I
can't wait to wear them because I
honestly don't have like any high
quality belts and I feel like that's
such an investment so I got two very
different styles both equally love the
first one is a little bit skinnier let
me just loop her through so she looks
prepared first one looks like this it's
got like a shiny black kind of patent
leather look yeah you just have this
little gold detail in the front and I
just love how skinny it is it's simple
it'll be great for like high-waisted
jeans with a white shirt black shirt
whatever just to keep it simple you know
how many times am I gonna say simple the
second belt that I picked out I'm so
excited about because I've never owned a
belt that's chunkier and meant to go
over like sweaters and shirts versus
being looped through like the pant loops
if you get what I'm saying my mom and I
saw this one and we honestly gave it a
moment of silence we just looked at and
we're like wow this was meant to be this
is this is yeah what how freaking
beautiful is this belt the actual belts
has a reptile pattern to it and then it
has this little silver front plate
detail thing I don't even know what to
call it and then you just have like you
know holes and little things in the back
this is gonna look so good over like
chunky sweaters and dresses I don't even
know I don't even know how to style
about like this but I'm gonna figure it
out very very thankful for everything
I'm so excited to use all this stuff I'm
literally gonna like turn off the camera
and like make a little cup of coffee and
like set it up on the look of the little
station and I'm excited I'm probably
gonna read tonight off living also just
wanted to make a quick comment because I
talked about in my blog channel but my
last two videos definitely a little
different than my usual sorry sending my
I my last two videos were definitely a
little different as far as the filming
and editing goes because I filmed like
four videos with a shooter slash editor
to kind of feel it out and see if that
can be a thing that I can rely on when I
start shooting more and basically I just
don't want to disappear for two months
like I did in the fall time not cool
Claudia can't do that again it's gonna
be kind of a trial and error type thing
and I'm taking in all of your guys
comments I agree that like the second
angle should it be as you know handheld
and shaky it can definitely be more
still and kind of less of that less of
the back-and-forth so I'm totally taking
what you guys are saying that being said
I do have like two or I guess like one
more video that's kind of gonna look
like that anyways I feel like I didn't
really need to explain that but I just
kind of wanted to but I hope you guys
enjoyed today's video I'm so so excited
for everything to come in 2018 I hope
you guys have a great start to your new
year with a great mindset if you guys
want to follow my second chair
I love logging and I plan on doing that
a bunch this year so I will have that
link down below and then of course my
Instagram and Twitter and all those
things all right we're gonna go I'll see
you guys for a new video very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
