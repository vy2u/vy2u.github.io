toilet right now but it's really late
which explains why I'm in my bathroom
right now and I'm not wearing any makeup
or I didn't really do anything to my
hair not like I normally do anything to
my hair but you guys get my point so
recently I posted a photo on Instagram
showing you guys all the stuff that I
packed for New York City because I'm
leaving tomorrow at 7 a.m. to New York
City and I got a bunch of a bunch of
requests to do this video and yeah I
personally love watching these types of
videos whether it's like what's my purse
or just showing what people pack for
vacation maybe it's because I'm a nosy
person but I figured that some of you
guys would enjoy this video so I decided
to record it anyway so yeah if you guys
want to see what I packed for New York
then just keep on watching so whenever I
go on vacation I like to lay everything
out on my bed just so that I see
everything and make sure not to forget
anything so on my way to New York I'm
going to be packing all this into my
suitcase right here which is from
Victoria's Secret pink and this is a
little bit too big for a carry-on so
this is just gonna go to luggage and it
actually gets really big when you fill
it up so if it's a lot in there so I'm
basically going to be packing all that
in there and then on the airplane I'm
