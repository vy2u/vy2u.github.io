say that I'm like really loving this
lighting it's like almost 8:30 right now
and it's really dark outside and all I
have is just a lamp in front of me and I
don't know why but I like this lighting
because it actually shows like my skin
color and stuff but I'm so sorry I
haven't made a video in such a long time
so today I'm going to be showing you
guys what is in my backpack for school
bag or whatever you guys want to call it
and also I'm going to start out with
just a quick little outfit of the day
and just letting you guys know I did not
wear this to school because these shorts
are way too short to wear for the school
because otherwise we get gym shorted and
I just kind of threw this on and this
would be an outfit to maybe wear it to
the mall or if you're going to your
friend's house or something like that
and also it's really really simple so
I'm wearing this thing what's it called
cardigan I don't even know but you guys
seen this in my holo and this is from
Hollister it's like a very loose almost
like a sweater with short sleeves if you
guys know I'm saying so that's how it
looks
until you loose and flowy and I'm just
wearing a plain stretchy tank top a
white tank top underneath that you can
get anywhere like Target and then I'm
wearing these ever coming Fitch jeans
that are all ripped up so they're really
cute and then also I'm wearing this
belts which i think is from either ever
copy or ever coming fish but I love it
so much and it has a well it has like a
gold flower on it and then also I'm
wearing this necklace that I wear all
the time and this is from Juicy Couture
and this came on my little perfume and I
wear it like every day okay so that was
a quick little outfit of the day I
didn't wear this the entire day because
I had school and just letting you guys
know I start school at 8 o'clock because
um only my first day of school was
really late and you guys like what
school starts at 12 or whatever 12:30
and I'm like no that was just the first
day of school so I actually started
school at like 8 o'clock okay so enough
rambling on let me get to the main point
of this video and that is what is inside
my school bag so first off last year
like the last three years I used a tote
or like a little shoulder bag from ever
coming bitch you know spray and those
are really bad for your back so I
actually got a backpack this year and I
