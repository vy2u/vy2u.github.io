may notice that my makeup and hair looks
very similar to my last Q&amp;amp;A video that
is because I am pre filming today so
this is the same day but today I wanted
to do a what's in my backpack
/ purse type of video I don't know what
I'm going to title this yet because
technically this is a backpack but I
definitely use this as a purse because
it's if you haven't noticed it's a
pretty small back but yeah I haven't
done one of these videos in at least
over a year so today I decided why the
heck not show you guys what's inside so
to start off with the actual backpack
this is a Stella McCartney backpack it's
my newest addition to buy purse
collection this thing was the greatest
purchase I have ever made having a
backpack is so convenient you literally
feel like you don't have it on your back
you've got free arms you don't have to
worry about forgetting your bag anywhere
because it's always on your back also I
like how it's not like black because I
have a lot of black bags already so
let's see what's inside of here honestly
I'm already going to let you guys know
to set your standards low as far as the
entertainment level of what's inside of
here I usually keep my bags pretty clean
I don't have like random Rubik's cubes
flying out of here and like action
figures I don't know like I keep it
pretty basic so that is what you're
gonna see in here we'll see the first
thing in here is a pair of sunglasses I
always bring a pair around with me
because it is so sunny out here these
are by the brand Spitfire there are my
favorite glasses at the moment they're
black and they've got really cool kind
of like details on the front so we've
got those also it's very important to
keep a case because you don't want to
scratch your glasses or ruin them next
up we've got my cellphone I
have an iPhone 6 just the regular I want
the Plus really bad but I'm gonna wait
to get the 6s plus and I've got a
wildflower case on my phone next up
we've got my wallet and I've had this
wallet for so many years now it's
probably in my last what's in my purse
video but it's from microphone Marc
Jacobs and the reason why I like it so
much is just the way that it's all
organized inside of here I'm going to
cover this half but over here you've got
all of your cards and there's like a
little window for your ID and then
behind it you've got like a general
pocket for more stuff and you have a
zipper pocket which is great for things
that need to be protected more and this
is called the phone wallet because
you're supposed to be able to fit your
phone in here which I actually don't
think I can because iPhones have
definitely gotten bigger since then
honestly I can totally like zip this
over like that and just carry this
around with me if I'm grocery shopping
like it perfectly fits in there I just
have cards and random receipts and all
of that fun wallet stuff next up we've
got some gum I love gum so much I
literally chew it for fun when I'm just
like sitting on my bed my favorite gum
is the orbit gum and these are my two
favorite flavors this one a sweet mint
which is so good oh my god this one's
like my number one favorites and then
this one is a winter mint so I always
have these in like all my purses we've
got an iPhone charger this is by the
brand Mophie and I always have it
charged up in my purse because you never
know when you're gonna need to charge
your phone but I also have this adorable
little short cord I got this from the
Apple Store and it's so cute it's like a
foot long or something I don't know it's
adorable save space life saver right
there
I just raved so much about it iPhone
charger I'm ridiculous we've also got a
receipts from I have no idea what we've
got a pen of course you never know when
you're gonna need one of those we've got
my keys and I
she really liked my keychain I got it
from All Saints it's like black but it's
leather and it's got dark Hardware on it
I think it's really cute and then we've
just got my house key and my car key and
yes I like to keep my keychain very
simple and light because I just can't
deal with like a keychain that has like
20 different things on it because half
the time I just like put in my pocket if
I'm going like somewhere I don't know
and then we don't really have very many
things left we've got a hair ties so
exciting two pieces of gum that fell out
of their packaging we've got a little
sample Cup probably from like a Trader
Joe's sample or you know any sort of
sample love the samples as far as this
big blush I can't talk today as far as
this bigger compartment I've got one
last thing and it's just a little USB
Drive because I had to print something
the other day but that is all that I
have in here so I guess to show you guys
the inside of this bag there's like a
little smaller pocket right here in the
back which is great and it just looks
like that and then for the Front's this
is usually where I keep like any makeup
that I want to quickly throw in to use
as like touch-ups throughout the day
right now I've got the lipstick that I'm
wearing right now which is the buxom
viggen healthy lipstick and it's in the
shade Shanghai definitely recommend it
and then also I always have this with me
always always always this is like my
all-time favorite holy grail lip product
ever and you guys know what I want to
say because I talk about it way too much
this is the buxom lip foundation and
it's in the shade undressed you think I
would have this memorized by now that is
actually everything that's inside my bag
I hope your standards were set low
because they were definitely very low if
not met to that low standard uhm but
hopefully you guys somewhat enjoyed
today's video
it's always fun to kind of see what's in
people's bags usually people that have
more interesting lives than me but you
know it's it's okay this this smells
requested so I need to justify it
somehow so I'm gonna go now and
contemplate whether titling this what's
in my purse or what's in my backpack
because I'm seriously struggling right
now yeah yeah I'm gonna do that for the
next week and then I'll see you guys for
a new video next week so we'll talk soon
okay all right if you guys enjoy to this
video give it a big thumbs up and follow
me on anything you want it's all down
there and thank you so much for watching
I love you guys bye somehow our night
led into us turning off all the lights
in our house and just having a dance
party in pitch black it was so funny
surprisingly no one got hurt but
literally like it was pitch black like
we couldn't see what we're doing we're
just dancing and being idiots</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
