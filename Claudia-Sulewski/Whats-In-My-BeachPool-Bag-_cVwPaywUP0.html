with Claudia I'm actually back from my
trip I am the biggest fail ever because
I wanted to film at least two videos
while I was at Florida but the lighting
was just never good and the audio sucks
because the waves would always interrupt
me and I was always backlit it's just I
envisioned that I would be filming in
this beautiful tropical you know
landscape with a nice background stuff
and it just didn't end up working out so
I decided to save all these videos to
film once I'm at home and yes I am also
wearing a very cheesy gift shop sweater
because I always end up getting these
Marco Anand so today I'm going to be
doing at my what's in my beach bag video
which I have a right over here to
starting off with the bag this bag is
from Victoria's Secret and it was
actually just a free purchase no it was
actually a free gift with a $35 purchase
that I got recently like right before I
left so I decided it was the perfect bag
to carry around with me for the beach
and normally this really wouldn't be my
number one choice for a beach bag it's
not really my style the whole pink thing
but I really do like bringing this bag
to the beach because your things just
get very dirty and Sandy and wet and
stuff like that I don't want to bring
like an expensive nice bag that I
actually care for to bring to the beach
so that's why I found this to be really
useful because I don't care what happens
to this thing at all it has little arm
straps at the top as well as a large
shoulder strip and the best part of all
it has a zipper on top which is really
nice because when the wind blows over
you don't want like Sam getting all up
in your bag so it keeps everything nice
and protected and safe and
good it's a dirty bag good yeah yeah the
first few items that I'm going to show
you guys I would normally be wearing on
my body but since I'm not in a beautiful
beach area location I just do them into
here to show you guys so I'm going to
start off with my swimsuit and I want to
show this one because it's really really
cute and I've really been liking it so
both the top and bottom are from paint
normally I get some suits from Victoria
Secret but I decided to check out pink
and I was really happy with what I found
so first off I got this or not this
isn't a whole the top that I have with
me looks like this so it's just simple
and black and I really like it because
it crosses over in the front and it has
little like slits right at your ribs so
it just has a really flattering cuts
with that top I really really like the
pink cheeky bottoms they're new this
season and I've got two pairs already
but they're just a bright teal color
with black lining all around and then as
you can see on the butt and a little bit
on the front it like rushes so these
bottoms are super flattering and it's
nice because you can tan your butts
while you're looking cute that's the
first thing that I have in here also I'm
of course wearing some sort of cover-up
so normally I like to either wear a
dress over my bathing suit or a romper I
never really do the whole top and shorts
thing when I go to the beach I don't
know why but I did use this romper a lot
and it's from LF it's just white and
then it goes into like a really pretty
lilac color so here's just an example of
what I would wear over my bathing suit
to the beach and lastly I would be
wearing some flip-flops and I got these
for my 18th birthday you guys saw them
they're just black to our birch left
flops so I wore these every single day
can't do that again so now I'm going to
show you guys what I actually carried in
my beach bag so first off I always
always always like to bring some sort of
book with me because you know after a
while music gets kind of boring but I
decided
that I wanted to read divergent over my
trip to Florida and I loved it so much I
already finished it but I just they're
in here to you know give you guys a
little visual example of what I would
throw in here I liked it so much that I
had to download the second book on my
iPad which normally I don't like reading
off my iPad but I just had to do it
because it was so good and I cannot wait
to read the entire series it's just it's
wonderful I just love this book so much
so I normally bring some sort of book or
magazine to read on the beach next up I
of course bring my cell phone and a pair
of headphones in case I want to listen
to some music I also always like to
bring water with me because I get very
dehydrated on the beach and it's just
very important to keep hydrated here's
my water bottle iced injure bread
flavored water you could just pump it
into your mouth when you get thirsty
actually that would be kind of No
okay next up I like to bring two
different kinds of sunscreen in my bag
for my body I have the Sun balm SPF 50
spray sunscreen that I just like to
spray all over and for my face I like to
use a lotion type sunscreen just because
my face tends to burn very fast so I
like having like a thicker sunscreen on
my face if that like makes any sense to
you guys
next up I always like to bring some sort
of makeup bag with me just in case if we
end up going anywhere afterwards and I
quickly just want to touch up with my
face so I decided that I actually wanted
to throw in my a monthly glam bag for
this month into my beach bag because the
theme of this bag is actually Spring
Break themed which is perfect because it
fit right in with what we're talking
about so as most of you guys know I am
an Ipsy stylist which means I create
videos for them every single month
showing you guys what is inside my glam
bag and how I like to use the products
and stuff so I feel like I've always
just kind of threw it in tutorials and
never really talked about it so if any
of you guys don't know what if she is it
a monthly subscription website where
they send you little glam bags every
single month and it's really fun because
you never know what you're gonna get so
it's kind of like a little surprise in
the mail and the bags are also always
really cute so that's kind of what I get
most excited for I love like the little
bags that comes with it so I'm just
quickly going to run through the
products that I got in my glam bag this
month and all of these are like spring
break themed so I actually was able to
use a lot of these so the first product
in here is the Vita Liberata luxury tan
lotion and it's just a self-tanning
lotion so this is really nice if you
want to just quickly apply it onto your
legs or anywhere in your body after the
beach if you just want to have that
golden glow and I actually ended up
using this a few times over my trip to
Florida just to apply it to my legs it's
very fast the color shows pretty much
right when you apply it onto your skin
which is nice just make sure that when
you use this lotion you wash your hands
immediately after applying it on because
you don't want black looking fingers I
have been there I've gone through that
it was not a pleasant time so I
definitely recommend washing your hands
after using it but yeah that was in
there as well as a body butter and I
kind of freaked out inside when I saw
this in my glam bag because I am really
really obsessed with the Pacifica
lotions I have some floral scent one as
well as like the blood orange or
something like that it's really popular
but this is the Pacifica Indian coconut
nectar body butter which smells so
freakin good it smells exactly like
coconuts and just other tropical um
goodness stuff I don't I'm not good at
explaining since I'm sorry
oh yeah keeping a lotion or body butter
in your beach bag is always a really
good idea because your skin tends to get
very dry when it's just sitting out in
the heat so it's really good to be able
to moisturize your skin once you get
back from the beach so I definitely
really appreciated having this body
butter in here because I was able to
just quickly apply it on to my entire
body next up I also got an eyeliner
and this is the cella eyeliner pen in
indigo of blue and this product is
actually waterproof and smudge-proof so
if you're one of those girls that likes
to wear just a little bit of makeup to
the beach then this is perfect because
you can create a winged eyeliner look or
just apply it onto your lower lash line
and this one is really fun because it is
like it said an indigo blue color so it
just gives you a nice little vibrant pop
to your face the next two products that
I got in my glam back would be nice to
wear after the beach if you're going out
anywhere so the first one is the NYX
love in Rio Shri oh that rhymed and it's
just a little eyeshadow trio and here
you've got a light creamy eyeshadow that
is perfect for highlighting your eyes or
just applying it into the inner corners
of your eyes then you have a medium
toned kind of bronze II eyeshadow and
lastly you get a black eyeliner inside
which is nice because you can also use
it as an eyeliner if you want to just
Pat it on your waterline or on your
upper lash line and smoke it out so I've
got that any last product that I got in
my clam bag was the bare minerals
marvelous Moxie lipstick in the shade
yet ready which is just kind of a darker
rosy pink color the size of it maybe one
of the reasons why I really love this
lipstick because it is so compact and
perfect to throw into your bag or
anywhere so it's great for travels and
it's overall just a very nice and
versatile color that will look great
with like any look the next thing that I
have in the beach bag is kind of an
obvious one I don't know why I didn't
show this earlier but it is a towel so
I've just got this blue looking towel so
I've actually only got two more things
left in my bag I don't really like to
carry a lot because I don't like it to
be very heavy so the second to last
thing I like to carry it I dropped it it
truly is never a Claudia video without
me dropping something um so the second
last thing that I like to carry in my
beach bag is a hairbrush and this is
you tangle teezer it looks like a little
hairbrush for a cat or something but
it's for humans and I really like these
palm-sized hand brushes because they
just really get the knots out and last
but not least of course a pair of shades
these are a little bit more in the
sassier side because they've got a cat
eye shape to them but I'm pretty sure I
got these from forever 21
I believe I mean I pretty much get all
of my glasses from there so I would
believe that I got them from there
obviously you want to protect your eyes
from the Sun and it's a lot easier to
read with these on rather than trying to
read with your naked eyes so that is
everything that I like to keep in my
beach bag that is it for today's video I
hope you guys enjoyed it be sure to
subscribe to keep updated with all of my
Spring Break with Claudia videos and I
will talk to you guys very soon bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
