video I asked you guys if you would like
to see a what's in my mini-fridge video
and I got a bunch of positive feedback
and a lot of comments asking to see it
so I was very excited because I loved
what's in my blank videos I think
they're so fun to watch and film so yeah
I don't want to bore you guys with like
a six minute intro so I'm just gonna get
in and show you guys what's my
mini-fridge and then at the end of the
video I'm going to talk about why I got
it and just like the details about that
as of right now I'd keep my mini fridge
underneath my bedside table and it fits
pretty much perfectly in that spot so as
far as what brand I bought and stuff
like that this fridge is from the brand
Emerson I got it on Sears calm and this
is the 1.8 cubic I think it's called
like compressor refrigerator I'm not
sure but I really like it because um
it's black on the top and on the sides
but on the front it's like a nice silver
color and I didn't want a white or black
fridge because I don't know why I just
feel like it wouldn't look good
so I'm very happy with the color choice
because I think it works really well
with them just everything else gray
that's my room like my makeup thing so
now let's get into what's inside so this
is what it looks like when it's open I
know it's too cute here is a little
freezer and I have nothing inside of it
right now but I just wanted to show you
guys that that it comes with a mini
freezer
it also has different settings and
mine's like at 4 starting with the door
I have 2 coconut waters on the bottom
these are by the brand Vita Coco and I'm
obsessed with these they taste so good
so I have one in the pineapple flavor
and the peach mango flavor and I don't
like the original one so I always get
the flavored ones and then over here I
have some Yoplait Greek 100 calorie
yogurts and I love Greek yogurt is so
healthy for you and it's a great snack
for like after school and stuff and then
up here oh my god guys how perfect is
this so I like getting the Yoplait
lights because um there
a lot more sweeter than for example
Greek yogurt so they're great for like a
mini dessert so I have the flavors
Boston cream pie I think this is just
mango and banana cream pie and how cute
is that they literally fit perfectly in
that one spot it was it's it's like
destiny guys and then over here for my
main fridge I have a bunch of fruit I
want on a huge like fruit shopping spree
today and I also got these mini little
containers that fit perfectly so I have
some raspberries some blackberries
blueberries and then over here I have a
bunch of strawberries and then in these
little circle containers I bought six
Kiwis and cut them up and then up here I
just have three water bottles so that is
everything that I store in my mini
fridge and as you can hear the cooling
compressing thing just kicked in because
when you keep it open for too long
that's what happens so what that is when
I keep in my mini fridge and obviously
since it is a fridge it's always going
to be changing up like sometimes I'll
have carrots in there or apples or
pineapple or tangerines so before I tell
you guys why I got the mini fridge I do
want to note a little disclaimer I'm
saying that I did pay for the fridge
with my own money my parents did not pay
for even one cent and everything that I
buy for my mini fridge is with my own
money as well so I do do my own
groceries for my fridge and I also get a
lot of questions on how I earn my own
money because obviously I always talk
about how I pay for my own clothing and
you know for example the mini-fridge and
stuff like that so I do just quickly
want to talk about that I do make money
from YouTube pretty much every YouTube
Partner makes money from YouTube so it's
not really a big secret or anything but
I had a
that I would get a bunch of questions
asking about that so that's why I just
wanted to answer it in the video so the
number one reason I bought this mini
fridge is to make sure that I eat
healthy um so like I said before I only
keep healthy food in my fridge and it's
great it's actually been helping me a
lot because I just keep a bunch of fruit
in there and stuff like that so when I
come home from school instead of going
to my kitchen pantry because usually my
parents buy very unhealthy like junk
food and snacks like cheez-its and
goldfish and usually like after school
I'm like kind of hungry but I'm not like
starving so I'll snack on something so
normally I'll just grab like some sort
of junk food but now that I have a mini
fridge in my room and I'm able to kind
of you know choose what I can buy from
my own little like fridge I make sure
that I buy everything healthy so instead
of going to the kitchen I just go right
upstairs and choose a snack from my
fridge so it's actually helped me a lot
with eating healthier also having an
older brother in the house whenever I
would buy my own food or I would buy you
know coconut water and stuff like that
someone would always end up eating it if
it's in the kitchen
usually it's my brother or my dad or
something but that bothered me so much
because it's it's literally been going
on like my entire life in this household
anytime you buy something for yourself
and you put it in the kitchen a fridge
it's going to be gone the next day if
you don't eat it that day so that's also
why I wanted to buy my own in my room
because then no one's going to be eating
the food that I purchased with my own
money so yeah that is it for today's
video and I will talk to you guys later
