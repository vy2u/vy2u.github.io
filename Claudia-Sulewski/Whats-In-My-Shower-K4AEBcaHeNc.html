I'm going to be showing you guys what is
in my shower and what I like to use when
I'm taking showers so yeah this has been
a pretty requested video so we're just
gonna get right into it for those of you
who haven't seen my bathroom but this is
what my shower looks like I basically
just have a bathtub which I'm standing
in right now and then I just have a
shower so I have two main little areas
where i keep my products so i'm going to
first start out with this little area
right here it kind of like pushes into
the wall i have this cute little lunch
with these um what is this with these
like stone angels and stuff so i think
it's really cute i love how it looks so
let's begin with what I keep all my
ledge just starting on the right side I
have the body wash that I've been using
for a few months now actually and it's
the clean and clear body boost mango and
papaya body wash I'm almost out of this
I'd literally have like an inch left but
I really like it so I just leave that
there and this is why use just to wash
my body every day um then I also have
this face wash in here because I do wash
my face in the shower my main face wash
is sitting by the sink which is the
Clean &amp;amp; Clear sensitive like essentials
one it's the one in the yellow bottle
but recently i've been using their
advantage daily suiting acne wash and i
really like it because it comes out in
like a plump form if you can see that so
that's really cool that wasn't a good
idea so basically I've just been
switching back and forth with what face
wash I use because my skin has been
pretty good then in the middle right
here I keep my hair mask which is the
macadamia natural oil deep repair masque
I feel like everyone in YouTube loves
this stuff but I really
love it for my super dried and fried
colored hair so this is great and then
over here I have this little like soap
dish thing that's plastic and I think
it's from like Lux naturals calm or
something I don't even know where I got
it but I just keep these two little lush
things I don't even know what this star
is but I just rub it on my body
sometimes at the end of my shower and
I'll rinse it off and then also I think
this is a massage bar but I just have
that there if I want to kind of like rub
it into my legs and then just kind of
quickly rinse it off before I how about
so I just have those there and then here
are my main to hair products that I've
been using the first one is my shampoo
this is the Aussie moist shampoo so far
I've been really liking it but I do
change up my shampoos quite often so I
never really had like a certain favorite
then for my conditioner I like to use
the Aussie moist three minute miracle
deep treatment and I use this every
single day as a will not every day
because I don't wash my hair every day
but every time I want to use conditioner
then I just use this one because i
really love it and all you do is just
squeeze it and it comes out like that
now when you slide over to the left
you'll see my second little station area
starting on this side I just have my
shower curtain obviously and it's
actually really cute it's like white and
has this nice crochet detailing on the
bottom and then over here suction cups
to the mirror I have my razor with a
little holder and then also on the far
end I have my little blue loofah from
Bath and Body Works then over here I
have this plastic little bin thats
hanging from the hooks of this mirror
thing I don't even know what you would
call this yeah so just keep a bunch of
random stuff in here so first off I have
this smooth shaving cream I got this for
one of my classy but says so I'll use
that and then also I have the when sweet
almond mint cleaning conditioner I love
using this every now and then to kind of
cleanse the bottom of my
hair because I don't really like to put
shampoo on the bottom of my hair then I
also have this little random bath and
shower oil that my mom likes to use
because she loves taking baths in here
then I also have the twilights love
shower gel which I'm almost out of next
I have the fight oh I think it's called
and this is just a hair mask I'm pretty
much out of this but yeah I really like
that I think that was in one of my loss
of boxes as well then also pretty much
like everything in here is to play
glossy bugs for example this one as well
this is the Sebastian color ignites
multi-tone hair color I think it's like
a shampoo or something or now it's a
conditioner and it squirts out into foam
form so that's kind of cool then I also
have the other clean and clear daily
soothing products from their new line
because this is their newest line and
this is the what is it called the acne
scrub and I like using this like once a
week so you kind of exfoliate my skin
and stuff so I've been really enjoying
that and then also I have these two john
frieda hair products they are the sheer
blonde color renew tone correcting
shampoo and conditioner I like using
these after I die my hair blonder
because it helps kind of take out that
brassiness or orange looking tone in my
hair so that's really nice I don't
really use them that often at once again
I want to use them like when I'm dying
my hair and then lastly i have this sub
lime mousse like I don't even know this
is from one of my hair dime kits but I
really like the conditioners that they
come on so that's just a random
conditioner and then usually here let me
bring you guys up little usually I keep
towels up here but right now they're all
in the wash so I don't have any so as
everything that I keep in my shower I
hope you guys enjoyed today's video and
I will talk to you guys later bye
a bathtub is so slippery now so that
conditioner oh my god
oh my are you kidding me I'm not trying
to be funny right now this is really
going up turning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
