I'm going to be showing you guys what is
in my shower and what I like to use when
I'm taking showers so yeah this has been
a pretty requested video so we're just
gonna get right into it for those of you
who haven't seen my bathroom but this is
what my shower looks like I basically
just have a bathtub which I'm standing
in right now and then I just have a
shower so I have two main little areas
where I keep my products so I'm gonna
first start out with this little area
right here it kind of like pushes into
the wall I have this cute little lunch
with these umm what is this with these
like stone angels and stuff so I think
it's really cute I love how it looks so
let's begin with what I keep on my ledge
just starting on the right side I have
the body wash that I've been using for a
few months now actually and it's the
clean and clear body boost mango and
papaya body wash I'm almost out of this
I literally have like an inch left but I
really like it so I just leave that
there and this is what I use just to
wash my body every day then I also have
this face wash in here because I do wash
my face in the shower my main face wash
is sitting by the sink which is the
cleaning clear sensitive like essentials
one it's the one in the yellow bottle
but recently I've been using of their
advantage daily soothing acne wash and I
really like it because it comes out in
like a pump form if you can see that so
that's really cool that wasn't a good
idea so basically I've just been
switching back and forth with what face
wash I use because my skin has been
pretty good then in the middle right
here I keep my hair mask which is the
macadamia natural oil deep repair mask I
feel like everyone on YouTube loves this
stuff but I really
love it for my super dried and fried
colored hair so this is great and then
over here I have this little like
soapdish thing that's plastic and I
think it's from like Lux Naturals calm
or something I don't even know where I
got it but I just keep these two little
lush things I don't even know what this
star is but I just rub it on my body
sometimes at the end of my shower and
I'll rinse it off and then also I think
this is a massage bar but I just had
that there if I want to kind of like rub
it into my legs and then just kind of
quickly rinse it off before I hop out so
I just add those there and then here are
my main two hair products that I've been
using and the first one is my shampoo
this is the Aussie moist shampoo so far
I've been really liking it but I do
change up my shampoos quite often so
I've never really had like a certain
favorite then for my conditioner I like
to use the Aussie moist 3 minute miracle
deep treatment and I use this every
single day as a well not every day coz I
don't wash my hair every day but every
time I want to use conditioner and then
I just use this one because I really
love it and all you do is just squeeze
it and it comes out like that now when
you slide over to the left you'll see my
second little station area starting on
this side I just have my shower curtain
obviously and it's actually really cute
it's like white and has this nice
crochet detailing on the bottom and then
over here suction cups to the mirror I
have my razor with a little holder and
then also on the far end I have my
little blue loofah from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works then over here I have this plastic
little bin that's hanging from the hooks
of this mirror thing I don't even know
what you would call this yeah so just
keep a bunch of random stuff in here so
first off I have this smooth shaving
cream I got this for one of my classic
boxes so I'll use that and then also I
have the when sweet almond mint cleaning
conditioner I love using this every now
and then to kind of cleanse the bottom
of my
hair because I don't really like to put
shampoo on the bottom of my hair then I
also have this little random bath and
shower oil that my mom wants to use cuz
she loves taking baths in here then I
also have the twilights lush shower gel
which I'm almost out of next I have the
phyto I think it's called and this is
just a hair mask I'm pretty much out of
this but yeah I really like that I think
that was in one of my Lawson boxes as
well then also pretty much like
everything in here is simply a glossy
box for example this one as well this is
the sebastian color ignites multi tone
hair color I think it's like a shampoo
or something or no it's a conditioner
and it squirts out into foam forms so
that's kind of cool then I also have the
other clean and clear daily soothing
product from their new line because this
is their newest line and this is the
what is it called the acne scrub and I
like using this like once a week so you
kind of exfoliate my skin and stuff so
I've been really enjoying that and then
also I have these two john frieda hair
products they are the sheer blonde color
renew tone correcting shampoo and
conditioner I like using these after I
dye my hair blonde hair because it helps
kind of take off that brassiness or
orange looking tone in my hair so that's
really nice I don't really use them that
often at once again I only use that like
when I'm dyeing my hair and then lastly
I have this sub lime mousse like I don't
even know this is from one of my hair
dyeing kits but I really like the
conditioners that they come up so that's
just a random conditioner and then
usually here let me bring you guys up
little usually I keep towels up here but
right now they're all in the wash so I
don't have any so that is everything
that I keep in my shower I hope you guys
enjoyed today's video and I will talk to
you guys later bye
a bathtub is so slippery analysis of
that conditioner oh my god
all right are you kidding me
I'm not trying to be funny right now
this is really annoying</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
