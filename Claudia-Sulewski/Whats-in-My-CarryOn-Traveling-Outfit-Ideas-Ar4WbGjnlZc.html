obviously the holidays are here lots of
traveling is going on today I'm going to
be show you guys what I wear and what I
bring to make my traveling experience
that much better as best as it can be
because who really enjoys sitting on a
plane for an extended period of time so
we're going to start off with what I
like to wear when I travel personally my
number one rule is comfort whatever I'm
wearing however long the plane ride is I
need to be comfortable whether it's my
hoodie or sweatpants or top or even
brought about 99% of the time you will
catch me wearing Calvin Klein's and it's
like from the aesthetic and coolness of
the brand everything is genuinely very
comfortable aka
travel outfit which before we get into
the outfits I would like to thank you
Calvin Klein times 1 million one
thousand for working with me on this
video and collaborating with me because
seriously some of these like little real
quick career goals so yeah I was
genuinely so so excited to talk about
Calvin Klein and incorporate it into
this video because it's so suiting the
first thing that people usually think of
when they hear Calvin Klein is the
classic modern cotton bra less but I
really wanted to express the huge range
of styles that they have for any
occasion and anyone so whether you're
trying to be comfy with some sweatpants
or little cuter it was like a denim
jacket or literally if you just want to
look super cute while you're sleeping
they also have pajama sets so there are
so many different styles and stuff the
pajama sets I'm showing guys right now
is called be translucent pajama set oh
my god is so cute
so obviously what I'm talking about
Comfort I'm talking about comfort in all
aspects from the inside and out so
starting off on the inside what kind of
bra are you wearing when traveling I
personally usually go for sports bras
just because they're super comfortable
for example with the modern con braless
I literally have it in like every shade
so depending on what I'm wearing and
what mood I'm in but if you're more of a
real bra fitted type of gal then I would
recommend their essentials t-shirt bra
so these have the cup and the underwire
and all that support but they're also
just extremely comfortable
obviously they
being the season of gift-giving whether
it's to yourself or to your loved ones
if you want to purchase anything in
today's video long Calvin Klein comm for
Gary from 25% off all intimates and free
shipping incredible also dangerous
because that is really making me want to
purchase more let's get into what I know
you like to wear on an airplane
we reside there lifting
I don't even hardened if you have a star
you better stop crazy
now let's get into what I like to bring
on the plane with me the bag that I like
to travel with is actually a workout bag
but let me tell you it does an
incredible job for traveling this black
duffel is from Lululemon and the reason
why I like to travel with this is
because there are so many pockets and
compartments so it's super easy to have
everything organized and have its own
place starting off with the stretchy
little pockets on the side one of them
is empty and the other one has a pair of
black fuzzy socks sometimes it gets
really cold on flights and you want to
wear thick or fuzzy socks so that I have
those before as if into the main
compartment there's a smaller one in the
front and this is where I like to keep
my important stuff like my wallet
passport things like that because you
always have to grab for them when you're
getting your ticket and going through
security you know all that stuff so
we've got my wallet and my house keys
lastly I have a very sketchy worn out
looking lip lock bag of some UK money
pound coins dollars whatever you want to
call it that's it for the front pocket
now we unzip to the main portion the
first thing that I always always brings
me on a flight especially if it's longer
is a neck pillow this is crucial when
falling asleep on a plane the times I
don't bring this I always wake up like a
sore neck this kind of keeps my neck in
check that rhyme my cellphone for
obvious reasons I like to bring my
little MacBook Air with me so whether I
need to use the in-flight Wi-Fi or just
reading scripts off of here all that
good stuff I like to bring my computer
with me the plastic case and marble
sticker are from unique finds obviously
when being a youtuber you've got to have
some sort of electronic bag I like to
keep all my cords and eletronics
together because they get all jumbly and
tied and wobble blah in your bag so just
keeping it in its own little compartment
makes it so much easier and for starters
the vlog camera by the way if you guys
don't follow me on my vlog channel I
have been vlogging every single day this
month leading up to Christmas and every
single vlog is ridiculous but really cap
is my personality in life very well so I
definitely recommend link down below
portable charger can't even begin to
explain how important this is because
some flights don't have outlets in them
computer charger phone charger and then
lastly an extra little vlogging camera
battery my other little badge that I
have in here is just little and black
and as you call this my homemade
emergency kit really anything that I
think I'll be needing obviously lip balm
some gum or mints this is a new thing
but I'm starting to bring the little
bottles of mouthwash they use especially
after long slice you just all you want
to do is either brush your teeth or just
freshen up a little bit so this is great
when flying the air is super dry so I
like to bring some little lotion with me
and then the last thing I have in here
is a little roller perfume one is huge
crucial step is to always always pack
other tampons or liners with you if
you're a girl
because you never freaking know it's
happened on the other side I have some
earbuds we're listening to music or
editing videos and then on the back
right here you've got to larger zipper
pocket and the first one I'd like to
bring some sort of snap with me because
I don't always like the snacks that
airports sell or snacks on the plane so
in here I have a go macro bar I've been
loving these this one is in the flavor
sunflower butter and chocolate probably
my favorite one and then in the last
zipper pocket I always like to bring a
book with me right now I'm currently
reading all the bright places everyone
has warned me that I will eventually cry
while reading this book we haven't
reached that point yet kind of excited
to because I'm dramatic like that I
don't know what I like to read a book
with me and then lastly I always like to
bring a notepad and a marker pen with me
just because sometimes I like to jot
down ideas for videos or honestly
anything any sort of thoughts that I
want to write down I always like to
bring a little notepad with me so that
is all I like to bring with me and wear
when traveling if you guys like this
video be sure to give it a big thumbs up
thank you so much Calvin Klein for
working with me on today's video and of
course I will have all the products

out get some things for yourself and
your friends and your family why am I
talking like this I don't know I'll see
