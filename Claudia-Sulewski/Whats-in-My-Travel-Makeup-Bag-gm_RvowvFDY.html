wondering where I am right now I'm
actually in New York in my hotel room so
excuse the background but yeah I'm in
New York for Fashion Week for those of
you guys who didn't know it's amazing
I'm having so much fun but I did want to
film a video for you guys because you
know I'm here for two weeks that's a
long time so I want to get something out
before I get into today's video I wanted
to first thank you guys for your amazing
and sweet comments for my latest
lookbook I will have that right here so
you can click on it if you have not seen
that yet but yeah I just wanted to thank
you guys because you guys are so sweet
and I'm just really happy that a lot of
you guys appreciated the editing and
effort that it took to make that video
because that is honestly like the best
video I've ever made like I'm so proud
of it
so I'm really really happy that you guys
enjoyed that it definitely inspired me
to work harder at editing my videos and
just making fun and interesting original
videos that are a little bit more
creative so if you guys like those kind
of videos and you want me to keep doing
videos like that then definitely thumbs
up those videos that I know the second
thing that I wanted to mention is if you
guys have not seen in my latest video
that I uploaded on here it's actually me
interviewing a makeup artist from
Maybelline that gave Almodovar he is
literally the coolest person ever I love
him so much and I got to interview him
so I'll have that video linked down here
in case you guys have not seen that but
that kind of gives you guys a little
sneak peek on what I've been doing here
in New York so you can click on that
video I think it turned out really cool
haddon I edit that one style Halden but
I was very excited when they told me
that I could upload that video onto my
channel so you guys can check that out
there
anyways this is like the longest intro
I've ever done today I'm going to be
doing a what's in my travel makeup bag
because I don't think I've done this
effort or in a long time I'm not really
sure I have all of my makeup right here
so I decided to show it to you guys so
first off I want to show you guys how I
travel with my makeup brushes I have
this black brush belt I'm not sure where
I got this but it just looks like this
and they're falling out but most of my
brushes are from Sigma so I'll link them
down below but yeah I pretty much carry
like a wide assortment of brushes but I
don't know I really like this little
belt thing and for my makeup bag I bring
this white bag right here which is from
Nine West and it's not like the
prettiest thing but it's the perfect
size for me it's not too big not too
small so I don't end up bringing like
too much makeup and also it has like
plastic on the inside so it's easy to
clean I'm gonna try to show you guys my
face products first but I'm just picking
them out of here so I don't know we'll
see how that works out
so first off I have my Beauty Blender
from Sephora and I just use this every
day for my foundation next up I have my
benefit Porefessional face primer to put
on before I put on a makeup u.s. also
noticed that I have a lot of benefit
makeup it's just one of my favorite
brands this video isn't sponsored or
anything I just am obsessed with the
brand then I have my everyday foundation
which is the benefit hello flawless
oxygen Wow
Hetal you guys for wondering next up I
have my benefit well rested face and eye
brightener I love this thing so much you
just twist it and you debit on whatever
places want to highlight so I love
putting this on my cheekbones I did that
today and I also put it on my under eye
circles definitely recommend that next
up I have my benefit fake up concealer I
like this one because it has like a
moisturizing ring on the outside and
it's just like the perfect shade for me
and I'm a medium so I've got that next I
also carry a blotting sheets with me
these are from clean and clear and I
literally take these everywhere with me
because my face gets super super oily so
these are like a must for me I also have
my favorite bronzer which is the benefit
hoola bronzer it looks like it is I've
also got the Urban Decay Naked flushed
palette which has a bronzer highlight
and a blush and I really like all of
these shades so this is great for
traveling my last face product in here
is the amazing cosmetics concealer and
yeah so now let's get into I makeup
products so first off I've gotten my
Maybelline big eyes mascara and this
mascara is really cool because it has a
wand for your upper lashes which is just
like a normal wand and then it has a
smaller one for your lower lashes
so it's really neat and it looks really
good on that I'm also gots my Urban
Decay Naked 2 palette I brought this
with me just because you can crease so
nobody it looks with it so it looks like
that next up I have my Urban Decay Naked
basics palette which I pretty much use
every single day I'm actually wearing it
right now I will tell you guys switch
colors so I've gotten naked - just like
a topi Brown I got that all over my eyes
and then I took faint and pretty much
just like smudged it all over I don't
know I just made like a really smudgy
eye makeup look today but the thing that
sucks is that the black eyeshadow
actually cracked in here so I don't have
any more black eyeshadow in here
there sucks because I used to always use
it as like eyeliner and stuff but yeah
actually cracked in here and all my
makeup got really dirty and black and
it's really gross I mean everything's
clean now so that's good but now I don't
have a black eyeshadow I've also got
this black eyeliner with me it is the LA
girl glide and gel liner next up I've
got the benefit brow so go go eyebrow
kids and if I can only bring one product
with me well try blink they would 100%
have to be this one just because
eyebrows are very important for me like
my natural eye brows are very like light
and I really like bold and dark eyebrows
so I fill my eyebrows in every single
day I get questions about them all the
time from you guys so this is what I use
every single day it's actually funny how
much this has been through so please do
not judge me when you see how it looks
once I open it but okay well first off
of course I cracked the mirror so it's
ratchet looking and then also it's just
it's very dirty looking like I used to
use the gel but then I kind of ran out
of that so I started using a new dark
powder and I'm obsessed with it I
actually like the powder way more than
the gel so yeah I like to use this dark
brown powder and then yeah I pretty much
lost everything that was supposed to be
here except for this little brush that
didn't even come with this one actually
that came with something else but yeah I
used that little powder right there
every single day to continue with my
wretchedness my Urban Decay eyeshadow
primer potion broke so I had to do put
it into a random little container that I
could find so I've got the bare minerals
container for I don't even know what but
I just keep my eye shadow like primer in
here so that's how I store my primer oh
yeah you know I DIY all the time next up
I've got this NYX liquid brown liner
I've been meaning to buy a black liquid
eyeliner for so long but I don't know
why I just always forget every time I'm
shopping so I've just been using this
dark brown one which honestly I really
like dark brown eyeliners that's not
that bad but I need to get on that I
need to get a black one so I've got this
dark brown one and I think that is oh
I've got one more eye makeup product
which is the cella ivory lace
highlighter and this is good for the
inner corners for the brow bone
I like to use this for highlighting a
lot so lastly I just have a few at lip
products so first off I've got the
Burt's Bees chapstick then I also have
at these two men lipsticks which I
actually got on this trip so I probably
will be featuring them in my NYC Hall
but others show them to you guys anyways
so this one is in the shade of rebel
which is like a dark purple it's
actually what I'm wearing on my lips
right now with another liner that I will
show you guys later
so I'm wearing rebel on my lips right
now but it's really pretty and then also
I have a Ruby woo which Ali recommended
to me and it's like the most perfect
read ever it looks perfect on anyone I
love the finish on it and it's really
pretty so I have those two then I also I
look so unprepared I actually have
another lipstick with me and the shade
hue but that's in Harts bag that's right
here and you do but I think it's in her
purse yes she was holding it for me like
the first day and I forgot to get it
back and it's been like two weeks um but
yeah I brought that with me and then
also I had two NYX butter glosses lost
one of them but this is in the shade
apple strudel and then I also brought me
Claire with me just like my favorite one
Avril it's just like I'd be in pain I
talk about it all the time then I also
have the Revlon lip butter in the shade
creamsicle it's good for like everyday
and then I've got this smack liner which
is what I'm wearing underneath the rebel
and this is in the shade magenta and
it's just like a bright purpley pink
magenta in color but it's really pretty
and it looks really pretty underneath
the lipstick and then lastly yes lastly
I've got this lipstick from buxom and
this is in the shade Shanghai it's like
a cranberry red so it's really pretty
for the fall time and that concludes
what I bring in my travel makeup bag so
I hope you guys enjoyed today's video I
pretty much talked about these products
all the time so I was scared that you
guys would find this video kind of
boring but I just wanted to film
something for you guys because I don't
want to leave you guys hanging I'm in
New York be sure to check out all the
other videos that I'm uploading right
