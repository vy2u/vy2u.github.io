awaited what's in my yoga / workout bag
I wanted to mention a couple things that
have recently been going on with me so
first off if you guys may notice by the
quality of this video but I did get a
new camera and hopefully the quality is
really good sorry I keep looking at the
little screen to make sure I'm in focus
but it's gonna take me a while to get
used to this like manual focusing and
stuff but I got the Canon Rebel t4i and
I have been wanting this camera for
literally like two years maybe like a
year and a half or something but it is
such an expensive camera that I just
never like felt like buying it you know
what I mean but actually clean and clear
paid for this camera and I'm literally
so grateful for that and it's just it's
unbelievable so thank you so much clean
and clear for generously paying for this
camera it's I just I'm in love with it
it's my new baby
umm I literally got it like two days ago
so that's the first thing and also you
actually notice I cut my hair again I
realized that I have an obsession with
kind of my hair literally like every
single night I just kind of look at my
pair of scissors and I'm like you know
what I like like half an inch isn't
really gonna you know do any damage so I
literally like cut my hair like every
other day but I mean that's what it
looks like now let me know if you guys
think I should go a little shorter I
feel like I should go like this short I
think that'd be really pretty like an
inch off I don't really know I've been
loving my short hair it is so easy to
brush and curl and just manage so it's
been great so that's all that I really
just wanted to mention before I get in
today's actual video so now let's get
into what is in my yoga / workout bag so
I first want to start out by talking a
little bit about the bag that I use this
is the keep on running duffel by Ruby
lemon this bag is litter
like perfection if you guys are looking
for some sort of workout bag or yoga bag
I definitely recommend this one it is so
nice it's so durable it's great quality
and you can use this for many things
there are pockets on the side right here
on both sides in the front there's like
a little pouch right here there is
literally there are endless pockets in
this bag there's one right here there's
the main pocket in the middle which of
course has pockets inside and then in
the back here you've got little pockets
I've literally been saying that word
pockets 500 times within the last like a
minute but there are these two pockets
right here on the back that have little
like mesh holing so you can put like
dirty socks in it or drink laundry so
that doesn't stink up anything else in
your bag it's really nice like the
hardware on here is like a shiny black
metal it looks super like squeak and I
just I have so much to say about this
bag so I will leave the link down for
this bag it's somewhat expensive but if
you're gonna be using as much as I do
then it's definitely worth it
so now let's get into what I bring to
yoga with me
the first thing that I like to carry in
this bag is my yoga mat and I don't know
where I got it it's just my mom's it's
purple and obviously I don't have it in
here right now because otherwise you
would seed it but the main reason I got
this bag is because on the front there's
little zippers right here and you can
slide your yoga mat through the front
like this so that's really nice and then
also in the front right here it's like
heavy my arm hurts there's a little
pouch right here and all I keep in here
is just my lock and ice-t-- have a
really cute like purple lock that
matched to everything else in this bag
but I lost it so I'm just using my old
school gym locker and I used a lock
because obviously in my yoga studio I
like to keep everything in a locker in
the locker room so I like to lock
everything out because you know I keep
like I don't know my phone and
everything so now getting into
main compartment this is basically where
I keep everything so first off I just
threw in a little yoga outfit normally I
don't really have this in here I guess
sometimes I like pack it up beforehand
but I mainly just wanted to kind of show
you guys what I like to wear to yoga so
I just threw this in here before the
video so mainly what I wear is just like
crops yoga leggings so they just go
right past my knee and they fold down
these are from forever 21 I literally
have a million of these in every single
color so I just wear one of those and
then I just wear some sort of sports bra
but my favorite sports bras are from
Erie I have like three of them and they
just have the best like padding and
everything they're just such good
quality so that's like pretty much what
I wear to yoga every single time next up
I have some deodorant also I have my
water bottle which is empty right now
but this is the Camelback insulated
water bottle it's kind of cool because
it's like blue and then pink and then it
makes purple so um normally I just put
in like water ice and lemon in here
because I love lemon water
these are super important if you guys
want to start doing like hot yoga or
yoga sculpts I definitely recommend
bringing these to with you so first off
when you're doing like hot yoga yoga
sculpt or whatever normally all of them
are in warm temperature drums you get
very very sweaty and that makes the mat
like super slippery so I definitely
recommend getting a yoga towel this one
I got from Target calm and it's by the
brand yogi toes which in my opinion is
the best brand out there for yoga towels
and it's basically like a very thin
towel for your yoga mat this will help
to absorb the sweat so you're not
slipping and sliding everywhere so it's
great because you can kind of grip onto
your mat better and also it's really
nice because the entire back of this
towel just has little gummy balls to
help stick to the math the entire back
side of the towel is covered in these
yeah this towel is really
it good quality and I love it it's like
tie-dye and stuff so I just don't two of
these I have this one from yogi toes and
then I also have one from Lululemon
which is just light blue and then it has
like a black border it's very cute so I
just keep - because after yoga I like to
wash them and I just kind of alternate
between the two and switch off and then
also I definitely recommend drinking
some sort of little towel to wipe your
face wipe your arm literally who I fear
entire body while you're doing yoga
because you just get so sweaty sometimes
I end up just bringing like those
kitchen towel rags because I run out of
little towels so just anything that you
can like you're swimming off with also
in this front pocket right here I keep
my keys and I have a little glitzy glam
keychain thing here let me zoom up for
you guys it's black and it just has to
see on it and I bring this with me
because it has my house key and you know
some breath spray just in case if you
know like Liam Hemsworth ends up in your
yoga class and then I also have my
membership card to my yoga studio so
that is why I have that with me because
then I just like scan in then I also
keep a wide tooth comb because at the
end of the yoga my hair isn't really
that dry it's pretty sweaty so I like to
carry a wide toothed comb with me if I
want to brush it out and then also I
have a soft lips
chapstick because I just carry chapstick
everywhere I go normally I keep my phone
in that pocket as well and then I have a
receipt but this is from when I used it
for Hawaii that is everything that I
keep in my yoga / workout bag I mainly
just want to do this video to introduce
you guys to this bag just in case any of
you were looking for one because I'm I
just this one's amazing so that is it
for today's video I hope you guys
enjoyed it kind of blow and tell me what
you guys think about this quality and
I'm just so pumped to film tutorials and
all that stuff
because it's just gonna be super clear
and stuff so make sure you watch this
video in HD to get the full experience
and Oh tell me what you guys think about
when you're here too and if I should cut
it because I feel like I should get like
an inch off and then I'll be perfect so
um that is everything I'll talk to you
guys very soon and that's it right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
