doing a what's in my purse video because
I recently asked you guys if you wanted
to see an updated one and a lot of you
guys did so that's what I'm doing today
also if my face looks like it's
progressively getting sweaty err and
sweaty err in this video that is because
it most likely is because it's like a
hundred degrees in my room ah so before
I show you guys what is actually in my
bag I quickly want to talk about it so
this is the bag that I've pretty much
been using every single day since I've
got it
I initially introduced this beautiful
creature to you guys in my apron
svidriga√Ølov the you know different
features of this bag and stuff like that
so I want to take this opportunity now
to give you guys a little review on this
bag so this is the small antique Anna
Givenchy bag in I believe the color is
soft pebble or black pebble something
like that I really like the color of
this it's just a black leather meh
finish she would also purchase a shinier
option but I like this one because it
doesn't scratch as easily also as you
can see the hardware on this bag is
silver which I prefer over gold because
I tend to wear a lot more silver than
gold so it was just very practical for
me and overall the hardware on this bag
is very high quality
everything is very shiny and it doesn't
scratch easily like I don't have a
single scratch on this bag and I take it
everywhere with me
so far these straps you've got two
smaller handles at the top of the bag
and a longer strap that kind of hangs in
the front and I never really use this
strap just because it kind of awkwardly
sits like right underneath your armpit
so as you can see the handles are like
hitting my armpit but if I'm feeling
really lazy then I will
you'll use this strap it's not
uncomfortable or anything like that I
just kind of let it sit in the front
like this and I think it looks really
cute um and for the inside of the bag
you've got three pockets so on the front
side you've got two smaller ones that
would be perfect for your lipgloss and
your cellphone and then on the back side
the purse you have a zipper pocket I
also want to mention that it has two
little leather feet at the bottom which
I thought was a really nice touch
because when you set your bag down
you're not going to damage it or get a
dirty or anything because it lands on
these little leather pads so I thought
that was a very nice touch that they
added to the bag just a quick side note
I did not purposely add anything into
this bag to make this video funnier
you're not going to see me like pulling
out Chipotle burritos out of my bag or
something which honestly I wouldn't mind
at the moment uh so let's just get into
what I carry in my bag so the first
thing that I have in here is a water
bottle I try to stay as hydrated as I
can throughout the day so it's very
important to drink this cap is
definitely not on tight Oh next up we've
got my wallet and this is from Marc by
Marc Jacobs it is the phone wallet in
some mint
I honestly regret getting this color
because I don't know why I wouldn't
choose black I don't really know but
then again I don't really care I really
like this wallet it has card slots on
this side and then you can throw your
iPhone in here or sometimes I just like
to store receipts in here if it's a lot
inside of it so love it next up I just
got my cell phone this is the white
iPhone 5s no and I just have a really
boring white spec phone case on it the
next thing that I have in my bag is this
little notebook I'm really big into
writing all of my thoughts down so
whether I'm reading a to-do list or a
grocery list or I don't know like new
video ideas and stuff like that
so I like to carry a little journal with
me I got this in a random book store in
New York when I was with my brother and
the
ages are slightly wet thank you the next
item I have in here are my car keys
fun stuff you've got a Whole Foods
receipts a coupon coupons I don't use
coupons why do I still have these in
here we've got a Trader Joe's receipts
another coupon I don't know why I'm
showing you guys my trash before I
actually get into the more important
things but we're just going with it
so we've got oh um a to-do list I this
really cool notepad that I got from
Target where it has a to-do list and a
grocery list on the other side and I'm
obsessed with it because I love writing
down things and then just ripping it and
throwing in my bag so I usually have a
lot of those in here because I forget to
throw them out I've also got a packet of
emergency pink lemonade we've got this
little ring of cards and honestly I
always think that I'm gonna use it like
it has I mean it has my Panera card on
here and like Airy Ward's yoga Walgreens
I don't know I always carry around
thinking that I'm going to use it and
then I never do because I always forget
so this thing is like pointless next up
I've got a phone charger and this is the
Mophie I really like it connected to it
I have this little itty-bitty iPhone
cord and I am so obsessed with it I
recently got it at the Apple store I
think it's like a foot long or something
right did I really just yeah I just did
that but yeah I really love this iPhone
charger it comes in so much use and it
has saved my phone's life numerous times
to stay on the topic of chargers I also
have a little wall plug in in case I'm
inside or my juice pack is out of
battery I got this one from Urban
Outfitters and I'm obsessed with it
because it's my favorite color and it
also kind of feels like rubber which is
really cool to me honestly I do not
carry that much in my bag like I'm
almost down to the bottom but next up
I've got a hand sanitizer with me and
this is from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works it isn't
he sent Japanese cherry blossom it's
like awkwardly in-between smelling like
a perfume or cologne so it kind of just
smells like a really annoying perfume
smell I don't know I just want to finish
it next up we've got a
another to-do list from my little target
pad we've got one single Tampin next up
we've got the Nivea lip butter in
vanilla and macadamia kiss you guys know
how obsessed I am with these lip balms
so I always have to carry it around with
me I've also got a Macy's gift card
I've got a few cough drops there's
another one another one got a dime which
honestly I'm surprised because I never
actually have money on me I've got my
house key which conveniently isn't
hooked on to any keychain or anything so
I always end up losing it I've probably
showed you guys this before but it's
from South Park and I love it in the
zipper pocket of this purse I have a
mini nail filer I'm such a girl I've
also got an empty what is this called
ear plug holder funny story I recently
went to the doctors and she was looking
into my ear for whatever they do that
for and I found out that I have a
ruptured eardrum yeah if you guys don't
know what that is it basically means
that you have a hole in your eardrum oh
yeah I pretty much have to wear an ear
plug every single time I swim take a
shower do anything like that I'm like
really what is the word cautious about
it
honestly I don't even know if it's
healed yet why am I still talking about
this you guys do not care okay next up
we've got a pen this is actually the
last thing in my purse see yeah I don't
really carry a lot of things guys this
is a for a rolly fine pen I stole this
from my dad because it writes really
really smooth but that is everything
that is in my bag hopefully you guys
enjoyed it I feel like it wasn't very
interesting because my purse wasn't
really that interesting but next time I
will throw a chipotle burrito into my
bag maybe that will spice things up that
would have been more interesting pun
intended I'm gonna go
