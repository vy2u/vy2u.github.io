you guys what is in my school backpack
so quickly just want to mention a couple
things first off I'm all fancy looking
because I'm about to go to a birthday
dinner for a Jonas birthday
so that is why and also if you guys are
wondering why I have been the worst
youtuber ever lately and why I haven't
been able to film any videos I explained
a little bit about that in my newest
vlog on my second channel so I will
leave that linked down below in the
downbar so that you can see why I like
died on YouTube but yeah so let's just
get right into it so first off I don't
carry around like a tote or like a
shoulder bag because our lockers at
school are literally like this why my
back feet doesn't even fit in my locker
so we are forced to carry around our
backpacks throughout the entire day to
every single class so that's why I
invested in an actual backpack but I
actually really like it it's from North
Face and it is the borella's backpack
one of the main reasons why I love this
backpack is because you can fit so much
in this backpack without it looking big
or looking like a freshman backpack
because I know that a lot of backpacks
do that so I will really like show
people how many books I have to carry um
during like the beginning half of my day
and they will be so surprised because
like it does not get any bigger than
this it's literally like a black hole
you can fit so much in here and the size
never changes so that's really nice I'm
so far seem to start out by show you
guys what I keep in this front pocket
right here this is more like
miscellaneous things so I have my cell
phone which is the iPhone 4 with my
Urban Outfitters cat case everyone makes
fun of me for this case I think it's
cute but it's always like why would you
put a cat on your phone but whatever
then I have earbuds for music when I'm
bored I also have a hair tie for tennis
because we like to put this in our 20
look all cute then I also have or I
guess had a bag of quarters because I
always like buy snacks are fruit or
candy at the cafeteria so now I want a
dollar left in there then I also have
some strikes bark gum then I also have a
ring from pecks son I think my ward on
Friday that's what's in there then I
have a pink twisty tie from brandy
melville I have my little wallet thing
kind of like a coin purse thing this is
from pink Victoria Secret and then this
keychain holder is from glitzy glam and
in here I just have the money and my
debit card and my state ID and my school
ID and my ID from last year so I
probably carry too much stuff like I
don't I don't really need this for
school I don't know why I carry oh it's
cuz I hold my house cane here but I
don't think that's very safe to bring
all that stuff to school because it
could probably get stolen but yeah and
then also I have an orange twisty tie
and I think that's it at the bottom it's
just like gum wrappers and hair ties so
that's what's in there I'm sorry this
video is going to be very boring the
next pocket is the middle one right here
it's kind of smaller it's not really big
enough to carry like binders and stuff
but it's nice for like not related
school stuff so in here it looks like
this
so in this like velcro pocket I usually
keep a snack in here because my lunch is
very late so I usually snack during my
classes then there's like a zipper
pocket right here which is perfect to
keep like pads and tampons and stuff and
then also I have this white mesh bag
because I keep my tennis like workout
clothes in here because I have tennis
after school and it's like at my
school so I will have to bring like soft
knees and like a shirt or whatever every
day so I like put it in here and then
put in my tennis soccer before school
and then I take it home and it's just
like a cycle then I also have my makeup
bag and this is from Vera Bradley it's
so cute I think I'm gonna do a separate
video on this just to save some time and
then also I have my hairbrush which is
kind of big and people make fun of me
when I take it out and brush my hair but
I really like it it makes my hair feel
very smooth so it's always good and I
think that's it just more gum wrappers
it's pretty oh wait a second what's in
here
I've got Spanish flashcards from last
year don't even need these but I don't
know oh my gosh I've been looking for
this forever I literally thought I lost
this
okay this has been sitting in here all
summer cuz it's a little gross now
um okay this is a Mac machine cream
machine glass jeez I seriously thought I
lost it and this is a right image
oh my gosh I love this so much think
they'll freaking Lord okay see what else
I can find in here I have lotion it's a
coconut lime for or Benna there's
something for pina I don't know it's a
buy lotion alright I don't know why I
have it in there I never put on lotion
during school then in the biggest pocket
right here I keep all of my binders
books notebooks all that good stuff I
don't have a lot of stuff in my backpack
today just because I didn't really have
very much homework this weekend but I've
got my homework folder which I keep
pretty much all my subjects and all my
homework I have my Spanish folder with
me my math folder with me because I had
a math test tomorrow with my math
notebook my Spanish 3 disco break with
them no they at TV do this and I have my
daily planner I love this so much
it is so useful so I haven't used this
weekend I just started writing it out
but so cute then I have some candy
wrappers skittles are my favorite candy
oh my gosh I tried these for the first
time last week and they are so good the
yellow ones are my favorite they taste
like bubble gum so love that and then I
also have my pencil case which is just
black it's a target it's actually a
cosmetics case but it just has what
everybody's pencil cases have then I
also carry a waterproof football just in
case because sometimes I like playing
football in the hallways and then I also
sometimes bring my robe with me because
it can get really really cold in my
school so I'm obviously kidding about
the last two but I just had to spice up
this video in some way and that's pretty
much it oh and then also I have these
little side pockets here usually keep a
water bottle and then in here I just
carry like trash I think I've got Trader
Joe's this blueberry walks into a bar
cereal bar wrapper and I have more gum I
think that looks empty though and then I
have a butter LONDON nail polish I think
I was gonna like pay my nails that I
never did so that's just been in there
for like two weeks the red gum wrappers
and coins and that's it so I hope you
guys enjoyed today's video I know how
exciting it was you don't have to tell
me my backpack is obviously really
really interesting so that is it for
