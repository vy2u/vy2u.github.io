guys what is in my makeup bag now back
then I didn't really wear any makeup at
school barely because it was mostly
because I would wake up later so I
didn't really have time but now I wake
up earlier so I have more time to put on
makeup so now I actually carry around a
bag for makeup to school or wherever I'm
going in my purse and stuff so that's
what this video is gonna be about I'm
supposed to start out with what I used
to carry my makeup this is my makeup bag
you might be thinking Claudia that's
kind of big actually no if it's all my
makeup in here it's actually not that
big this totally would fit into like a
little clutch or something I just feel
like this stores all my makeup a lot
better than for example like something
like this or something so this is what I
carry around with me everyday to school
so let's get straight into what's inside
of my makeup bag
no I'm totally kidding this is actually
my makeup bag that I use this is
actually my lunch box
pretty embarrassing my friend bought it
for me is like a little joke
it says feeling skittish on here so it's
like an inside joke now but um five
stars if you have an embarrassing
lunchbox too but no this is actually
what I carry my makeup around and this
is from Dior and it's just gold flaps
over its magnetic and then there's all
my makeup so I'm gonna tell you guys
what's inside of here so first off with
brushes I only have one brush in here
and it is the icing kabuki brush
definitely loved is $7.50 totally worth
it it was a little staticky when I first
bought it but now it's not it's super
soft it's a great brush if you're on the
go then I've got one blush in here and
is Mac's blush babe
and it looks like this it looks
brand-new but I actually hit pan a while
ago but I was recording this video
yesterday and my blush actually fell out
of my hands and correct
so last night I pressed it and it was
all good this morning so actually I was
supposed to hit pan but yeah I guess you
can press blushes now I don't know it
worked for me so yeah then I've got one
bronzer in here and this is Lancome star
bronzer it's very small this isn't like
the miniature size and I really like it
I've been using it a lot lately it has
little shimmers in it so I've only got
one eyeshadow in here and I am obsessed
with this eyeshadow it's from Isadora
and I've used this in two of my
tutorials and it is just a very shimmery
neutral shade and this is in the color
frosty seashell number 82 so I really
love this I wear it all the time then
for lip products I have two lip balms
because I don't really get too crazy
with the lips during school time so I
mostly wear Burt's Bees beeswax lip balm
because you guys know that I'm obsessed
with this company and that I've also got
lip smackers on two grape because it
tastes amazing and then I've also got
one lipstick and one lip gloss in here
so for the lipstick I have the Revlon
nude attitude lipstick and honestly this
is probably the only lipstick that I
will wear to school that I own because
all my other lipsticks are either crazy
red or like a crazy hot pink so yes
that's my lipstick and then to go on top
of that the lip gloss that I use and I'm
obsessed with is the beauty rush lip
gloss from Victoria's Secret this is the
unknown flavor that I have
about it in my other video I don't
really know what smell or flavor this is
but it smells really good it's just a
very sparkly pink it's about it's not
too light it's not too dark it's just
sort of a medium toned pink then I've
got one mascara in here and it is the
Lancome definicils mascara and this is
in a little baby size and this has been
my favorite and most warm mascara for a
pretty long time no too bad that um it's
really small but I really like it
then for eyeliner I have two eyeliners
in here first off I've got the motives
luxe precision eye line and this is what
I would use on my upper lash line I
still love this and I still use it all
the time and then for the lower rim of
my eyes or the waterline I like to use a
white eyeliner and this is Sapporo's
nano liner in the shade pure white so
the last thing I have in here is just a
little mini hairspray and this is from
Tresemme and it's the super hold
hairspray it's super small so it fits in
here and sometimes you're in the day I
just like to touch up if maybe I curled
my hair that day it's super small which
I really like and that's the last thing
I have in here so yeah that's it for my
everyday makeup bag or what's in my
everyday makeup bag video I'm comment
below for any requests that you guys
have for me because I would love to
listen to them and do them so thank you
guys so much for watching today's video
and I'll see you guys there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
