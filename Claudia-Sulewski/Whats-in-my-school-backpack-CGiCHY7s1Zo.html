my what's in my backpack video and I
don't know why I feel like this is
crooked maybe it's not I don't know okay
sorry but this video was very requested
a long time ago and I'm finally getting
up to doing it also if you haven't
noticed my outfit and hair is all the
same as my last video because I'm
recording this at the same day so this
is my backpack I do not carry a tote or
side bag just because it's really a pain
when you have a bunch of books you want
to carry and you have to go through you
know your school day with having sore
shoulders so definitely backpacks is the
way to go for me at least and just
better it's more convenient for me I
really don't care about like how my
backpack looks but actually like my lot
I think I have a pretty backpack it's
just black and simple but I like it so
this is the North Face backpack and this
is the borderless one as you can see I
think that's how you pronounce it I'm
not sure but I like it a lot so perfect
size for me it's really nice and comfy
on my back and stuff like that so first
off you've got these little things here
I don't really do anything with that
then also you have a front pocket here
and in here first off I always carry my
phone so just looks like that and then
also I have my little glitzy glam
keychain and I have my little wallets
and in here also had my key on here I
just carry extra singles for if I ever
want to buy lunch maybe because I'm
hungry or something I also carry my
school ID in here which I'm not going to
show you guys because it obviously says
my name and stuff like that but it just
looks like that also in this front
pocket I carry two combs because I just
like combs better on the life so I have
this one I use this mostly during
swimming unit because it's a wide
toothed comb with like a little rat tail
at the end or whatever and then also I
have a smaller tooth comb as well
then also in this front pocket I just
have one more thing which is my
headphones because I always pull these
out and listen to music during class or
whatever during the hall when I'm in the
hallways and stuff like that so then
this backpack has like two layers it has
like one big pocket and another big
pocket so in the first one I don't carry
any of my books in here because I don't
really like putting my books in here but
the inside is like cool it has a lot of
pockets I realized that I don't carry a
lot in my backpack so this video is
gonna be really short and I'm sorry
about that but I know how requested this
was so I'm just going to do it anyways
so I really don't have anything in my
backpack
but yeah so in this pocket
I have my big calculator and not going
to show you that size this is my name
but this is just the TI 48 plus Texas
instrumental calculator and this is the
one that doesn't come with the games so
I was actually really mad this Silver
Edition comes with the games and I chose
the black one I don't know why but
that's okay otherwise I would like
distract me in math class also I just
have my Beauty rush juice berry perfume
you guys know that I'm obsessed with
this it's like my signature scent but it
is running low this is just the mini one
I have a big one in my bathroom but this
is just a mini one to keep in there it's
running low then also I just have some
dum-dum rappers from Halloween and I'm
pretty sure OPI is Mike and Ikes and I
think that's it let's see my more
rappers I have an actual lollipop oh and
then also I have 2 eyeliners to kind of
touch up through the day because my
eyeliner always comes off I really need
to get better eyeliners so I have my Mac
one this is the eye Kohl and smolder it
doesn't stay on very long so I don't
I was kind of disappointed this but then
again I really like it because it's
really nice and creamy so I have that
and then also I have my little Sephora
nano
eyeliner and just white I think it's
called pure white so I just have two
others in there I don't really carry I
don't really have a makeup bag in here I
don't I don't know why I don't really
really have time to do my makeup at
school so I host I don't really have to
so then in the big backpack I have this
little vac folder right here and in here
I just have my planner which I'm kind of
growing apart from because I do have a
reminders app on my phone that I usually
use but I still use this for the
calendar part of it so I don't know I
still carry that around I use it a
couple times I don't know and then I
don't really have too much homework
today so I just have my two folders this
is my everyday every subject or folder
and then this is just my English folder
I don't have any books in here oh I have
one book and this is the gods heroes and
men of ancient Greece we're doing Greek
mythology right now so I have that I
don't like Greek mythology at all it's
really confusing because I can't
remember all the names and I have my
pencil case that you guys have seen
before and in here I just have what
everybody has in pencil cases I have
whiteout I have these little tabs that
are lifesavers I've got I've got these
awesome felt tip pens that obsessed with
from Paper Mate pens pencils wrappers
random papers and notes and nothing
really special there sorry my thing
keeps falling down to annoy me and then
the last thing in here I have is just my
old calculator because I like to do
fractions on this one because doing
fractions on my other calculator is
really annoying so I carried two of
calculators around and I don't know why
I drew so many hearts around it do you
see that I like a hundred hearts on
there yeah I had this in eighth grade
and I sell it really bored one day
I think that's it for the back pocket
and then I shall pencil down there too
so yeah the last two things of this
backpack are the little side things down
here I always carry a water bottle
around sometimes I carry my glitzy glam
tumbler and want the polka dots around
and it actually does spin here so
sometimes open in there but usually I
just carry it through the hallways but
other than that I always always always
always have a water bottle just because
I'm so thirsty throughout the day I
don't really drink too much day but yeah
water bottle nothing too special but I
always keep that on this side of
backpack and on this side of the
backpack is where I have my lip creme
lip products so first off oh and then
also I keep a little hair clip right
there yes
just for safety you know and in here
first off I have the Nevaeh chapstick
this stuff is seriously so moisturizing
I love it so much I shouldn't mention
this in my October favorites video oh my
gosh I'm so mad whatever but yeah now
you guys know I love this chapstick it's
so nice then also I have this l'oreal
infallible lip color stuff i don't
actually use this but it does have a
little mirror on it so i use that as a
mirror that's why i have that in there
because i don't really have a small nur
I need to get Windows then also I have
this little container thing that's from
Dior and this is not a Dior product what
happened was my elf mineral lip stick
and natural nymph cracked and broke and
I tried fixing it with the Michelle Phan
trick where you melt it and it didn't
work so I just had to like deep pot it
in here so my favorite lipstick is in
here now so I just carry this down which
is fine because I just did my finger on
it and so for that and then I also have
one more lipstick in here which is soft
nude by the colorburst
Revlon lipsticks and this is my second
favorite lipstick and looks like this
why don't I give you a
watch there's this watch so I just carry
all my lip products on this side I don't
know why I care about lip products in
here I feel like it's just more easy to
kind of go and get it that's basically
it for what's my backpack nothing really
special nothing really exciting anything
like that and that is truly what I have
in my backpack I didn't add anything to
make it funny because obviously this
video wasn't funny but as it for today's
video and I hope you guys enjoyed it and
kind of for requests that you guys want
me to do alright five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
