today's video is going to be what's on
my iPhone I quickly wanted to thank you
guys for all of you are extremely
amazing and sweet comments in my last
video I know it was a little weird have
you guys are like what did I just watch
are you okay Claudia did you take an
extreme amount of shrooms while you're
editing that no you guys know how much I
love to edit and mess with footage so I
really just did it for myself because I
wanted to see how crazy I can make it
and I think we reached that crazy level
so yeah you guys haven't seen last
week's video I'll link it down below oh
yeah let's get into today's video so I
have the iPhone 6 it's small its
portable I'll probably eventually
upgrade to the plus but for now I'm okay
with this one as far as my case I am
constantly switching out my cases but
the one that I have on right now is from
Urban Outfitters grids gotta love them
so I guess start off with the lockscreen
it's a weird one right now I am always
constantly changing my wallpapers and
that indeed is a photo of myself which
is kind of strange but I like the colors
of it and I think it's just kind of
different I don't know great jacket my
wallpaper on my home page is a photo of
a sunset that I took on my roof and I
guess to start off with the dashboard on
the bottom going from the left I have
messages obviously phone mail and
Spotify and if you guys don't know what
Spotify is oh my goodness you need to
get onto this train ever since making a
Spotify account I no longer use iTunes
and ever buy any of my music I do pay
monthly it for the premium accounts but
it is so worth it now going on with the
rest you can see that I like to put
things in categories it makes me less
overwhelmed and I feel like I have my
life put together start it off from the
top I have settings calendar weather
Safari blah blah next up I have
I actually have a code if you guys want
I always like it down below but if you
use it you get your first ride free and
I think I get like $15 credit or
something like that this is me just like
hooking it up for you guys and myself
mutually beneficial situation I mean I
stuff I have ways which is what I like
to use for getting directions to go to
places because it takes traffic into
account so it gives you a lot of side
road options and you avoid the freeways
if they're super backed up and stuff
like that so using Waze out in LA is a
really really good idea then of course
I've got maps and then to the right I
have my lifestyle folder Yelp tasks
rabbits which I've never actually used
Domino's app self-explanatory love
Domino's next up we've got post mates
which is basically like uber for food
Trip Advisor similar to yell free Wi-Fi
honestly I've never used it but
apparently it's supposed to help you
find free Wi-Fi wherever you are and
then key flow never really use that
either it's some nightlife app thing
next up I've got my music folder so in
here I've got SoundCloud Shazam which
comes in such great use to find out what
a song is that you're listening to
we've got tuner lights which helps you
tune your guitar my brother Kevin
actually showed me this one soundTouch
it's that that goes with my speaker
music and rap genius which drew showed
me and this app is incredible because
your ever listening to a song and you
want to know what the lyrics are BAM
next up we've got productivity good
notes reminders notes audiobooks audible
self-explanatory kind of a boring one on
to the next we've got my video folder
which has social blade which is pretty
cool because you can look at your
analytics for your YouTube channel as
well as your Instagram we've got GoPro
studio which is a really great YouTube
app and of course YouTube go 90 which is
another viewing platform sidenote tag is
coming out and go 90 very soon this
summer so stay tuned for that and then
DJI go which is a complimentary app to
this cam
that I have where you use them at the
same time these are the different apps
that I'll use for my instagrams or just
photos in general so obviously you've
got facetune everyone has facetune
everyone gets pimples vsco cam quick
rant with vsco cam because i was
obsessed with this app everyone is it's
so great when it comes to editing photos
but recently they updated the app and i
absolutely hate the new update the
photos are no longer and squares I don't
like how much black is going on I feel
like it's messing with my eyes and my
vision not that I really have an
Instagram theme anymore dislike blue
square up here to sign in or sign up I
don't want to sign their sign up like
just take it out and I said we've got
frame magic in case I want to do a pic
collage of some sort pic lab don't
really use this but sometimes it's fun
to put words or like stickers on photos
boomerang I love boomerang so much and I
Instagram them a lot and then body
symbol which I also never really use
clearly I was going for something over
here and then just gave up one photo in
but you can basically choose different
shapes and then create it with a bunch
of photos and it kind of helps you do
that and it's really cool but why do I
have it I don't know then going down to
the fourth row we've got photos snapchat
a pretty much snapchat every single day
I kind of suck at social media but I try
to keep up with that my username for
everything is just Claudius Alou skiing
so we've got Twitter and then Instagram
I'll show you guys a little preview of
the things that I post yeah it's a
little cluttered don't really have a
feed but it's all good I feel like it's
more about the individual photo itself
that's what I what I focus on now oh
yeah love Instagram probably my favorite
social platform I have so much
next up I made a little Facebook folder
because Facebook and messenger are two
different apps I don't understand that
but messenger is basically messaging on
Facebook so I have those two and I have
my Fitness Pal which is a calorie
counting app I honestly never use this
besides every so often when I feel like
I've been eating really crappy and I
just want to kind of kick myself in the
butt and like work harder again and then
also I have IMDB which is basically a
website that will show you any of the
work that actresses actors directors
producers casting directors all those
people when they've worked on and their
credits and stuff like that and then
moving on to the second page I guys I
told you my phone is so boring I have
like nothing on my phone I've got the
App Store then an extras folder with
these things you guys all have them
whatsapp I don't use that I think I had
to use it in England or something the
next folder is literally called folder
and once again things that I never use
touch but I just cannot delete off of my
phone then we've got this little backup
social folder here are some social apps
that I don't really use that often but
still want on my phone so Yik yak it's
like an anonymous Twitter type thing by
my friends or find friends such a good
app if you connect with your friends
family whenever you can see where they
are all the time periscope don't really
use that Pinterest sometimes use that
vine never really use that Dropbox every
so often see this is don't talk about
this is the folder that I don't really
use and then next up we've got finance
with just a sprinkle of Airline Bank of
America my bank out venmo which I just
recently converted to Lexi has been
trying to get me to use venmo for
exactly a year now I was so stubborn
about getting this out I don't know why
but it's the greatest thing ever and
no longer think that it's sketchy really
really like it love mo and then American
Airlines because that is the airline
that I chose to sign up with to gain
points miles things like that and then
next up we have productivity never use
this folder this is the first time I'm
opening this in like at least over a
year this app called
either it's called polish or fabulo not
really sure I remember one day I was
downloading a bunch of polish apps
because I wanted to better my skills
next up we have barcode alarm
it's basically an alarm clock and the
only way you can turn off the alarm is
if you go and scan whatever product you
set for that alarm and then we've got
sleep cycle I go through phases with
this one it's cool you can basically
track how deep you're sleeping every
single night and if you're ever waking
up throughout the night then we have
time passages which is an astrology app
I believe comment down below and tell me
what you guys think on the whole
horoscope astrology stuff I know so many
people that are super into it
I find myself every so often reading
them and I don't know I don't know how I
feel about it and the last app I have is
be glammed I've never used this I guess
it's just a quick way to hire people to
do your makeup and hair and stuff like
that I saw someone Instagram it I think
it was Warren and yeah I've never used
it kind of don't know if I trust it like
I feel like for a big event
I'd rather hire someone that I know
comment down below if you guys have ever
used that and yeah that is actually it
for my cell phone thank you guys so much
for watching today's video I love you
all very much and I hope you're having
an incredible start to your summer I'm
so excited for it to be summer it feels
great I can feel it in the air um okay I
