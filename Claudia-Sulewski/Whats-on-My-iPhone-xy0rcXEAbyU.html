talking about cell phones and cell phone
cases and stuff like that and also I'm
going to kind of turn this into a what's
on my iPhone type of video I've seen a
couple girls do this before where
basically they just like give you a tour
of like what's on their iPhone and I
thought that was kind of cute and you
know I can show you guys all the apps
that I have which I really don't have
that many but you know it was still be
fun to kind of show you guys what I have
on my phone but before I start out with
showing like what's on my phone and
stuff like that I want to talk about the
case that is on my phone so basically
this is my case it is so pretty I love
it it looks like this oh you can see my
camera right there okay um so it looks
like this it's just like crystals all
over and it's silver and I love it it's
so cute and bedazzled I got this case
from bling cases calm and of course I'll
have all the links in the downbar and
stuff like that but they did send me
this case for free but I am in love with
this case it's so pretty I've actually
dropped it a couple times at school and
I think maybe like one rhinestone fell
off or something like that so it's doing
a really good job holding all the
rhinestones in and you don't obviously I
haven't broken my phone or cracked it or
anything like that and I absolutely love
it and then they also sent me a second
one which looks like this actually gave
this one to my mom because she needed
one too and I don't know if she like
took it off but yeah it looks like this
and it's silver and it has hot pink
crystals in the middle and I think this
one is adorable too and get this ready
this phone case was $15 and this phone
case was $20 I don't know about you but
I think that's amazing prices because I
remember when I got a phone case for my
old film which I actually have right
here which looks like this do you guys
remember this from like Lux addition or
Lux addiction era it was really cute I
loved it but this case was like 80 bucks
which was crazy
and it was really awesome when this
company reached out to me I looked on
the website and I saw like how
inexpensive some
them cases where like a lot of their
cases are even like 10 bucks it's really
crazy so when I saw that like the cases
were so inexpensive I was like oh my god
I have to share my views with this
website so this one was only $15 which i
think is crazy because I don't know if
you guys have this at your mouths but
you know those little like phone case
booths like in the middle in the mall
and what's it called every case is like
30 bucks they're all like really cute
but you like bargain with them and
they're like oh we're only going to sell
for 30 bucks and it's like really
expensive well you can get the same
thing online for like half the price
which is really awesome so yeah I think
I'm going to might switch them off I get
tired of this one or whatever but I love
it so much it's so cute and girly and it
matches my nails right now and yeah
that's what I first want to say I just
wanted to mention this just because it's
an amazing deal and I freaking love this
it's so cute and simple and classic and
sparkly um so now I'm going to show you
guys was on my iPhone so first when you
look at it it's just a picture of a city
I don't know kind of matches I guess you
know sparkly I don't know yes yeah my
password is C you know C for Claudia
right it makes sense so my background is
just I took a picture of the case and I
just wanted like the rhinestones so
that's like my background so it matched
my case I'm such a nerd but yeah let's
see okay so in front of it just looks
like this nothing really special so I
have okay so I have all the regular ones
right here and then I just put some of
them in a folder then I have iMovie
which is like an awesome app you can
like edit videos on your phone which i
think is really awesome it was five
dollars I think but you know totally
worth it and what else do I have here I
have Netflix oh my god Netflix is
probably my favorite app that I have
ever because I just end up watching like
I watched the entire every single season
of the hills that's like 200 episodes I
watched it all on my phone like last
summer it is really funny and then what
else I have
Twitter down here so I can just tweet to
you guys follow me on twitter which is
Chloe's leg and then just my iPod and
then I have a little folder right here
that says health and this is kind of
like my fitness like health food stuff
so the first one I have is food a kit
with which I talked about before with
you guys where basically you just scan
food and it kind of like puts a grade on
how healthy they are then I also have
what is this called fast food which is
like you like type in a food from like a
different restaurant and it shows all
the calories and stuff then I have Nike
training which I haven't used yet but it
looks really cool
I have Nike Plus GPS which I've used
when I go running and then also there's
acne away whoops and I saw a couple
people talk about this it's basically
when you shine like a red light on your
there you go on your like pimple and
then you change it to blue and it's
supposed to like make your acne go away
I don't really know I haven't used it
that often but I hear it actually works
so I just got that and then I also have
lose it which is a calorie counter which
I use sometimes and then I use it like
crazy but now I'm kind of lazy to type
in what I eat everyday but it was really
fun and then also I have the US Open
which is like for tennis and that
doesn't really have to do with health
but it kind of has to do with sports and
like fitness so I just kind of put it in
there so that's it for that folder and
then I just have my mail down here and
you know what else and then the second
page only has two folders yeah I don't
carry a lot of apps because I'm kind of
person that like I get an app I play it
and I beat the whole entire game the
whole app and I end up beating it like
one day I just been my entire daily
playing on one app and then when I
finish I just delete it - like say more
memory on my phone
so I have two little folders the first
one is random which is kind of like
random things so I have the BB Box Pro
which when you click on it it just has
little like buttons of little audio
things like looks like this
it's kind of quiet make it louder
yeah fired oh yeah just like that
and there's one onion sorry there's one
on here that sounds exactly like me
ready really does that not sound like me
right really really really really it
does that sound like me
it just amazed me I had to get this app
when I found that out because my friend
had it and it's awesome it has like
pages and pages of different sounds to
bother people you know then I have
Shazam which is really awesome it's
right here it's basically when you're
sitting in the car listening to the
radio or you're just with your friends
and you want to you like are listening
to a song and you really like it you
don't know that like what it's actually
called
and basically when you click this it
just kind of records a song and then it
recognizes it and it tells you what song
you're listening to so I think that's
really cool when you don't know what
you're listening to then also I have
tune in radio which is basically just
like a radio on your phone which I'll
listen to every now and then if I get
sick of the songs in my phone then I
also have a bazzill a--to which is one
of the greatest apps in the world
because it's basically an app that has
okay it's basically an app that has a
bunch of apps to it which some of them
are so cool like for example strobe
light and what else you can I don't know
there's so many random things in here
it's like nightlight walk-in texts
there's like games and price checks they
even have like a they have a lighter to
which I don't know what you would use
that for but you know it's pretty cool
and
drumset I don't know so that's really
fun to play with when you're bored or
whatever and some of the AI apps on
there like on that app like some of the
apps inside of it are really fun to use
and stuff like that
then I also have free Wi-Fi which I'm
not gonna click on because it shows me
shows you like where you live but it
looks like that and there's the episode
1 and that's just free Wi-Fi and it's
basically when you click it it shows
like a bunch of free Wi-Fi places around
where you live and it's really handy I
don't know I mean I do have 3G so
there's really no point of it but I
don't know I just have it I guess
because sometimes like when I go on
vacation maybe I'm going to start
bringing my laptop around and I want
free Wi-Fi so I'll check on my phone you
know so that makes sense then I also
have fake a call or it's an FAC call so
I don't know it's just like where you
fake a call and you know it's a great
way to kind of get yourself out of
situations like pretend like your mom's
calling be like hello you know I don't
know I think it's funny I don't really
use it but yeah and then I also have
remote which is at whoops ok which is
actually by Apple and basically what you
can do is you can hook it up to your
iTunes and it says my name so I'm not
going to show you guys but you pick up
you hook it up to your iTunes and it's
like a little remote and you can kind of
like fast-forward or make louder and
pause music that's coming from your
computer which i think is really cool
because when I'm jamming out to music in
my room and I have you know my I home
hooked up to my computer I can just walk
around carry this my pocket and like go
through songs it's like a remote so yeah
pretty cool love that and then the last
one on here is emoji free which is right
there and basically when you install it
you get a bunch of icons on your phone
that are really funny and cute and me my
friends always like text with the little
icons and like make little perverted
things and stuff it's really funny and
then the last folder that I have is
labeled games and this is where my games
are you save a lot more but I kind of
recently just like beaded all my games
beat
as I say I like beat all my games and so
first one is pseudo COO - I love Sudoku
it's so much fun then I also have a set
called teeny wings love that then I have
words words with friends or words free
and basically that's just like Scrabble
except you get to verse your friends and
you like connect it with Facebook and
then I also have doodle jump because
come on who doesn't have doodle jump and
then I have unblocked me which is
basically where you have like the blocks
and then the red block has to go through
here I'll show you guys looks like that
and you just kind of like go through I
can't really do this in my camera but
yeah you got it so it looks like that
and the last one I have is cover orange
you can see right there and that is
seriously like my most favorite game in
the entire world basically what you do
is you try to cover the oranges and like
when the rain rain comes you like have
to cover them if that makes any sense
let me show you one for example like
look like that and then I don't know I
bear
I don't even know what I'm doing right
now but no I won't but yeah and then
like the storm comes by yeah so you see
I just died right there but yeah
probably my favorite app in the entire
world what other apps I love I love
flying birds but I unlocked on the bird
so I just deleted it what else I loved
teenies ooh I don't know there's a lot
of games but I'm one of those people
that just like deletes them when I'm
done and as for music I don't really
have that many music on here I probably
have like 20 songs because I have a lot
more in my iTunes but I don't know I
just I'm too lazy to hook them up to my
phone so yeah that's it for my little
iPhone tour thingamabob or whatever and
check out bling cases comm you can click
on them in the downbar
and get these super cute and inexpensive
cases which is great so yeah that's it
for today's video and I hope you guys
enjoyed bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
