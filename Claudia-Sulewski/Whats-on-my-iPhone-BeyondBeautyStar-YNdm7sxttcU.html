you guys what is on my iPhone and this
video was very very requested and I
almost feel bad because my phone is so
boring like you guys will see I do not
have any games or anything cool on it
but I decided to show you guys anyways
because it was so requested if you guys
may have already noticed it's pretty
obvious my hair is a lot darker than
what it used to be but I will talk more
about my hair at the end of the video so
keep on watching if you want to see what
is on my iPhone so starting off with my
phone case I got mine from wildflower
cases calm which I'm sure you guys all
know of that website but I loved all of
their cases so it's just black and pink
and floral printed and then it has a
silver cross and I like these cases
because they have like rubber on the
sides like it's kind of like rubbery
feeling and it kind of like lifts up a
little bit so it protects your phone so
my wallpaper on my lockscreen is
currently a photo that I took while I
was in New York and Soho but this is
constantly changing so that's what I
have for now and I also don't have a
password because I'm too lazy to set one
so starting off with my apps on the top
row let me assume you guys in a bit I've
got my settings clock calendar weather
kind of boring just the typical ones
then I have notes and then I have this
lifestyle folder which just has some
random apps in it so I've got iTunes
which I never used because I have
Spotify so I never even like put any
music on my phone
like iTunes wise and then I've also got
Game Center passbook stocks I never used
those reminders sometimes I use it I
normally use it on my iPad and by the
way let me know if you guys want me to
do a what's in my iPad video because
I'll definitely do that so that's what I
normally use in my iPad
I've got maps which I use all the time
and I've also got ways which I here is a
very good app but I've still not used it
it's just been sitting on my phone for
the longest time
I've also got Eber which is one of my
favorite apps when I'm traveling it's
just so convenient and then I've Yelp
which I have only used like once yeah
that's it for that then I've just got
the App Store I've also got an astrology
little folder in here so I have three
apps the first one is just called
astrology and I'm pretty sure this
almost like ten dollars which is kind of
crazy for an app but I love it so much
it like gives you monthly ones and daily
and yesterday and today and I don't know
I'm like a true like believer and all
this stuff I don't know I just think
it's cool to look at so I don't take it
too seriously but I think it's still fun
and then I've also got a horoscope which
I'm pretty sure this one was free and
it's also my favorite one too
so I'm a Pisces I'm going to show you
guys what it looks like so you can do
like for example today it shows your
horoscope in like different categories
so mood love career so that's kind of
interesting and then you can also go to
tomorrow and do like the month year week
so that's really fun to look at and then
I also have daily horoscope I'm guessing
that's what it's called I never use this
one I don't think I like it I don't know
why so I have it on here but yeah I
don't really use that one so I just use
those two and then my third row has my
social media apps that I like regularly
use so I've got Twitter which by the way
my twitter handle is Claudia's life in
case you guys don't follow me and also
my Instagram username is also Claudia's
life so here's just a little glimpse of
what I like to post on Instagram follow
me on those if you guys want to and then
also I have Facebook and snapchat which
I use for like personal use so I'm not
going to show that and then below that
I've got photo such video and this just
has videos camera photos YouTube it's
just a youtube app I've got iMovie which
I I don't think I've even used it I
haven't used it in a long time but
basically you can just create like
iMovie projects on here and upload them
straight to YouTube so I think that's
really cool just in case if I ever want
to upload like a quick vlog off my phone
I've actually used it a few times and
it's really cool
then I just have Netflix which I use
every so often after that I've got my
photography little category and these
are all of my apps that I like to use to
edit my photos so I've got pic effects
which I'm sure you guys have seen this
is like the first app that I ever got
for editing outside of Instagram but I
don't really use that one that much I
also have square ready which is how you
make your photos like white in the
background so I use that all the time
and then pic collage pic lab pic lap is
kind of cool it gives you like the
different like frames and stuff like
that and then I've got vsco cam which I
don't really use because I like to use
the updated one which is this one right
here so yeah I really like this one you
can look at all the photos that you've
been editing and I definitely recommend
vsco cam I pronounced it vsco cam I
don't know how you pronounce it but yeah
I recommend that one I also have
afterlight which sometimes I use frame
magic to create those little collages
characters I use this for like your
captions and stuff and then I have two
more which I don't really use I have
insta blend which you take two photos
and you can like blend them together and
then insta collage which I don't even
know if I've ever used that one and then
I also have a health little folder the
first app I have is my Fitness Pal which
is just a calorie counting app and I
think it's really cool and interesting
to see like how many calories you should
be eating or how many you have been
eating and stuff so that's really fun to
use but I rarely use it then I also have
photo kit which is a really cool all
right
stop okay I really like this app because
basically what you do is you can scan
any like barcodes and then it gives a
great on how healthy the food is so a
being the healthiest and then F being
very unhealthy for you so that's really
fun to use if you're like grocery
shopping and you want to see how healthy
something is and then I also have fast
food which is really fun so it just has
a bunch of different chain restaurants
and like fast food places and then you
can go through their menus so
for example like Chili's like you can go
through soups and chili look at
something and then it gives you all the
nutrition facts about it so I really
like to use that when I'm going out then
lastly I just have my Starbucks app
which I like to use at Starbucks so
that's how much I currently have on
there it's really nice because you could
just scan it and pay right away so it's
very convenient and you can like earn
points and stuff and then I have a music
folder so I've got Spotify which I'm
obsessed with that's what I use for my
music then I have the iTunes music
library which like I said before I don't
use Pandora I don't really use how much
anymore and then Shazam of course which
is where it's just used to identify like
whatever song you're playing if you
don't know what you're listening to and
it's not gonna catch anything so why am
I doing this oh yeah that's really cool
if you're like listening to something
and you don't know what it's called and
then I just have FaceTime down there and
then down here I just have messages
phone mail and Safari I'm sorry my phone
is so boring and then on the second page
I don't have very many things so I've
got the nasty out app which is I'm
actually obsessed with anytime I'm bored
and I don't know what to do I'll just go
through this and just look at the app
because I'm obsessed with this website
and just the way it's like laid out is
really nice and just very like
convenient and stuff you can like go
through look at the info buy whatever
I haven't actually bought an off the app
before I don't know I'd rather do it on
a computer but it's still fun to look at
and then I have a finance folder and
that just has my bank account and my
PayPal and then I've got another social
folder which just has tumblr timehop
vine and okay hello so if you guys want
to follow me on tumblr you can time hop
it basically just shows you like things
that you've tweeted that exact day but
like years ago so two years ago on
Wednesday I tweeted just had to walk
through a wet field with my Tory Burch
flats oh my god
life is so hard so I think that's really
cool to see damn love it I don't even
what is this from like what god I was
such a freak but yeah that's a really
fun apps you look at and then I've just
got vine which I look at every so often
and then lastly I have okay hello and I
have not used that app yet I guess you
can like talk to people or something by
using user names I don't really know how
that works I'm still like testing around
with that one and then over here I've
got utilities so I've got contacts
calendar compass voice memos Google
Drive I really love using Google Drive
on my iPad and then newsstand and oh my
gosh that is all that's on my iPhone
that was really boring I apologize so I
hope you guys enjoyed that video and as
promised I wanted to quickly talk about
my hair because it's obviously a lot
different so I actually dyed it two
nights ago I couldn't really tell you
guys how I created this look because
when I tie my hair you guys know that I
just get very very lucky
I literally just put it on the top of my
hair and then took random pieces and
started dyeing it so as you guys can see
I still have that ombre effect because I
just couldn't leave it I just love ombre
so much on me so it's still pretty much
ombre but yeah it's a lot darker on the
top and I'm obsessed with it I was a
little scared because I had I used to
have really really dark hair like a long
time ago if you guys can see the
resemblance right now yeah I feel like
my old self but I really did not like my
hair dark I just thought it looked very
awkward on me but I've always been
obsessed with really dark hair so I was
a little bit scared but I just decided
hey I'm just gonna do it because I want
to do it for a while so I'm very very
happy with how it turned out I think
it'll be great for the fall and winter
time just to change things up because
I've had my hair blonde for such a long
time and yeah I really
like it I'm very happy if you guys like
my new hair color then show me bye
thumbs up being thumbs up in what this
video if you don't like it then keep
your thoughts to yourself because I am
really happy with my hair and that's all
that really matters so that's it for
today's video I hope you guys enjoyed it
and I will talk to you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
