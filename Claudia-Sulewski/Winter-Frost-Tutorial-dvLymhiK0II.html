jumbo I shall pencil in the shade milk
and you're just going to apply that to
your entire lid and smooth it out with
your fingers now taking a flat shader
brush and the 88 ultra shimmer eyeshadow
palette I'm going to choose a shimmery
light grey eyeshadow and I'm just going
to apply that on to my entire lid so now
I'm going to be using a shimmery light
blue eye shadow and just applying it to
the middle of my eyelids and make sure
that you blend everything out because
you do not want this look to look harsh
at all so now it's time for the gray eye
shadows and first off I'm going to
choose a medium toned eyeshadow and just
placing that into my crease and of
course make sure that you blend it out
with a big and fluffy eyeshadow brush
you
so now I'm going to choose the darker
grey and apply that into my crease as
well and I like this one a lot because
it definitely gives more of a smoky look
to the eyeshadow
next choose a matte white eyeshadow and
apply this in the inner corner and I'm
also going to bring it up to the brow
bone also I actually added a little bit
more of the dark gray just to give my
eye makeup look a little bit of a darker
effect
using a gel eyeliner I'm going to just
line my upper lash line very lightly and
softly you not want this to look too
harsh so yeah just make sure that you
don't really go too hard on the eyeliner
so now i'm going to apply it to my
waterline as well and to keep the black
staying on you can just put some eye
shadow on it and now i'm going to go
ahead and curl my lashes so for the
mascara i'm going to be using one of
those mascaras that have two sides to it
a white and a black so for the upper
lashes i'm going to be using the black
side and i'm just going to apply that to
my lashes so now for the bottom lashes
i'm actually going to be only using the
white side and i'm just going to kind of
roughly apply them to my lower lashes
and if it doesn't show off as well as
you want it to you can just dab on some
white eyeshadow as well so now you're
done I hope you guys enjoyed my tutorial
and i'll see you guys for another video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
