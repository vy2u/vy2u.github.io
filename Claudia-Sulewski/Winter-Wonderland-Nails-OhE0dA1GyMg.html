the nail polishes of the colors brown
white green and any other color that you
want is the background you're also going
to need some kind of dotting tool or you
could just use a toothpick for the
details so I'm going to be using this
kind of silvery grey nail polish in
pearl silver and I'm just going to apply
two coats of this evenly on all my nails
so now on to the trees we're going to be
grabbing this dark green nail polish
from sinful colors in san francisco and
i'm going to be putting the trees on my
ring finger my middle finger and my
thumb so the easiest way i think is to
making the trees is making a line first
and then you're going to drag out
smaller lines pointing downwards to
finish it off just make a horizontal
line on the bottom to flatten it out and
that's how my trees look soon tada so
now you want to grab any brown nail
polish and actually didn't own one so
this is the closest i can get with brown
nail polish and this is just in naughty
and are gonna do is grab a toothpick or
dining tool and create the trunk for the
trees
so it should look a little something
like this now while the trees are drying
I'm going to be creating the snow so I'm
just going to grab any white nail polish
with a dotting tool and I'm just going
to dot it all over my nails and you
can't really see it that well because of
the lighting but it looks so pretty when
you put white on top of silver so if you
want you can be done right now but I'm
actually going to add a little bit more
detail by putting some snow on the trees
and all you gonna do is grab the white
nail polish that you had used before and
just kind of make uneven random lines on
the trees to make it look like the snow
kind of fell in the branches and I think
it looks cute because a little bit more
detail so once you have let your nail is
completely dry just apply on your
favorite top coat and you are completely
finished so I hope you guys enjoy this
