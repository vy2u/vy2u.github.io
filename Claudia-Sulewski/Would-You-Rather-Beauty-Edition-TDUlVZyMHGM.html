say that this lighting is making me look
very orange and I've no idea why so I'm
not really this 100% but today I decide
to do TAC and I'm going to be doing
thing would you rather tag but like the
beauty edition I want to do this tag
because lately I've been seeing a lot of
you girls doing it and I don't know I
decided that I wanted to do it too and
also I'm gonna write in the description
box who I want to tag for this video so
I don't know yet but I'm gonna be
writing it down so check down there if I
tagged you guys and then also I Ted any
my subscribers and you can do the video
and just put it as a video response so
I've got all questions on my back book
right now so I'm gonna be looking down
at this thing alright so number one
would you rather go out with messy hair
and nice makeup or nice hair and no
makeup it kind of took me a while to
like kind of figure this out because I
don't worry too much makeup during the
summer especially but then again it's
nice to touch up on makeup like I've
been wearing a lot of like bronze aren't
tinted moisturizer lately and stuff like
that so I'd probably go with messy hair
and nice makeup because lately I've been
doing like like the messy hair sort of I
don't like care about my hair during the
summer because if anything I just kind
of put it up in a bun and so yeah I
would probably choose messy hair and
nice makeup
number two would you rather shave your
eyebrows or have your eyelashes fall out
definitely eyelashes because so you
could just glue on some fake eyelashes
but eyebrows I think would take a lot
longer to fill anyway pencil and like
make it all perfect and stuff and
that would not be worth it to waste my
time doing that every single day so I'd
rather choose fake eyelashes number
three would you rather be forced to shop
at only Mac or Sephora for the rest of
your life
definitely Sephora because Sephora has a
lot more than just makeup of their the
Clarisonic they have like self tanners
and hair essentials and stuff like that
and Mac Elena's makeup plus Sephora also
has a lot more makeup companies and just
a larger variety of makeup and stuff
like that and they also have black
perfumes and stuff so definitely Sephora
number four would you rather buy a
lipgloss slash lip liner look or the ad
sperm probably the lip gloss slash lip
liner perm perm oh my god what am I
saying the lip gloss and lip liner look
because first of all like I would not
want to give my hair curl I like my hair
straight and stuff and honestly I don't
think that the lip gloss will look
lighter look wouldn't be that bad so I
probably just do that number five would
you rather leave the house with an
honest foundation line or overdone blush
totally overdone blush because
foundation like once you set it and
everything it's kind of hard to like rub
it in I guess or left blend it out
because blush you can easily just have
blend it out of your cheeks or maybe it
looks like and you're blushing you know
if you have overdone blush and then
foundation lines are a little bit harder
to sort of like wear off and to make it
look like not there because I'm saying
so definitely overdone blush number six
would you rather wear I've seen Hammer
pants or biker shorts in public
I actually Google Images Google Image
both of these and biker shorts are just
like those shorts that are like really
tight Phillips spandex it kind of
depends like I've been seeing a lot of
models where
see Hammer pants and they kind of look
ridiculous I don't really like either of
them I guess I have to go with Emmer and
see Hammer pants because just a lot of
models are wearing it so I guess it's
trying to be like in fashion maybe it's
in or now I have no idea but I've been
seeing models wearing it so I probably
just wear that
remember side would you rather have a
bit orange you spray tan like I look
right now
or really weird tan lines that can't be
covered definitely 10 miles
I have talents all the time for my
bathing suit and stuff like that and I
wait to have an orange tan like I do in
this video I don't know why I seriously
think it's like the lighting or
something but I'm looking living right
now and I'm not this orange um let's see
number eight would you rather have a bad
haircut or better color definitely hair
color because it's a lot easier to you
know fix and stuff and haircut that
would just kind of suck because you
would have to wait for your hairs like
girls stuff number nine would you rather
have YouTube or Twitter taken away from
her definitely Twitter because YouTube
is like where this all started
I'd rather have YouTube because this is
where I make videos and like talk to my
subscribers and stuff and Twitter is
honestly just like another website for
you guys for me like keep you guys
updated so probably I'd rather have
Twitter taken away and number ten the
last question is would you rather get
back using makeup brushes or mascara
definitely I'd rather have makeup
brushes taken away from me because first
of all I reminisce Kara all the time and
second of all like I'm fine with using
my fingertips or like sponge applicators
for eyeshadow so I just think that
mascara is more important and yeah
that's it for my tag and also many guys
were asking in might a guru nail
tutorial
I assure you my nails
- a lot of you were asking how I created
that effect on my lips and I'm gonna
show you this right now so I used
concealer and I use the Coastal Scents
camel quad in color corrector Erin's I
used this yellow one I think but I'm
just going to use the purple one to show
you guys so basically what you do is oh
boy it looks so Orange
okay so I'm gonna grab the purple one
get it on my finger and basically all I
did was to make a KC like base or
whatever or whatever you guys call it
like like a fish face or something and
dad would can see there onto my lips and
that's what you get
so that's it for today's video is kind
of like a tab slash tutorial on how I
created those tiger lips so that's it
and tomorrow stay tuned to see my what's
in my purse video and yeah hopefully I'm
going to record that tomorrow maybe all
you can do it tonight I'm not sure but
that's it for today I'll see you guys
there bye
hard to get this stuff off tiger lips
and that's it that I have heard okay
forgot this okay all right I'll see you
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
