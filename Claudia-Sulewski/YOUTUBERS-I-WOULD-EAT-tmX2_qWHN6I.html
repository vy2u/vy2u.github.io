so today I decided that I wanted to film
a Q&amp;amp;A video I asked you guys to tweet me
using the hashtag ask claudia with any
questions that you have so I'm here to
answer them for you guys yay let's get
into this how is california i'm actually
not in california yet i'm going to be
moving next week which is so crazy to
think about i'm so sad to be leaving my
home town but i'm also super excited so
i've got a lot of mixed emotions about
the huge move but i just i cannot
believe that I'm moving next week I'm
moving next week wow how long are your
arms okay well let's check so 26 inches
do your green smoothies bring all the
boys to the yard or nah nah can we be
friends you're my fave well your avi
looks pretty interesting yeah we could
be friends would you doubt your hair any
other pastel color I was thinking about
this and I'm not sure yet because I
really really like the purple hair on me
it's kind of dark right now actually
it's not that light kind of faded too
but hi I don't know what do you guys
think maybe I will sometime this summer
but as of right now I like the purple so
the purple is staying if you were
stranded on an island with youtubers and
there was no food which youtuber would
you eat first um probably Justin
escalona if you could be an emoji which
one would you choose to be how was your
day it's been really good I ran some
errands with my friend neely we did a
little bit of grocery shopping she's my
wife went to the post office just did
some whyphy things favorite moment at
VidCon VidCon this year was so much fun
it was probably the best YouTube event
experience for me I got to meet a lot of
you guys make loving friends but I have
to say one of the greater moments of
VidCon would be meeting Ravi Richie and
Katy those three are the new loves of my
life and I just cannot wait to be
hanging out with them 24 7 in California
where's
booty I can't find the booty have you
ever gotten into a car crash I have
never gotten into like a serious car
crash but a few weeks ago I actually got
into a little little bump in with my mom
so I was in the car with my mom and she
was driving traffic was pretty heavy
we're on like a semi busy street and my
mom accidentally bumped into the car in
front of us and the lady she clearly was
just not having a good day she was like
all right like you need to meet me in
the parking lot that's over there and
we'll talk about this I'm sitting over
the passenger side like it's about to go
down my mom and this lady made this
little bump like the biggest deal ever
of course she ends up being polish as
well so they're screaming at each other
and polish and I'm just sitting in my
car like there is no dent in the car
there is no scratch the lady ends up
calling the police because my mom was
just I I don't know finally after like
an hour of fighting my mom finally gives
a lady her like insurance or whatever
info and turns out the lady never ends
up actually going through with the
report or whatever happens so she
actually like didn't didn't contact us
afterwards or anything it was a very big
deal ended up wasting like two hours of
my life will this be in your video no it
would be here zombie apocalypse team
youtube edition it would have to be my
Jessica's which are the following Aspen
Alex Emily Lindsey Megan Robbie Richie
Maddie and Katie no chance in living no
none name the closest thing to you that
starts with az shoot there is literally
nothing next to me that starts with a
see I can't even think of any Z words
besides zebra I have no zebras in here
Oh zipper show us the last text you sent
and the last text you received the last
thing i sent was hmm now I like the
eating one better okay I know what I'm
gonna do thanks guys heart and the last
one I received was Emily I just ate that
exact thing an hour ago OMFG from
Lindsay would you rather never see Aspen
again or never see your mom
well I don't know in Aspen would you
rather eat everything with ketchup or
mayo if you guys know one thing about me
that is that I despise mayo I hate it
with a burning passion I don't know why
I always have everything about it just
freaks me out so I would definitely have
to say catch up and I pretty much
already do put ketchup on everything so
this question doesn't really applied my
life if you were a bird whose head would
you poop on who I would poop on a lot of
people's heads let me tell ya probably
Justin escalona but after i eat him
because that would be gross has becoming
a youtuber change the way in which you
imagined your teenage years to be like
yes yes one hundred percent yes i feel
like my youtube channel has definitely
grown me and shaped me into the person
that I am today it's definitely made me
become more independent I've definitely
become more open and what's the word I'm
looking for um okay there's a spider on
my wall gross that's really good
outgoing that's the word would you
rather meet your parents as teenagers or
your kids from the future I would so
love to meet my parents as teenagers I
feel like my mom would be the same but I
think would be really interesting to me
my dad is teenager which eyebrow do you
prefer you guys know that I take my
eyebrows very seriously you know
honestly I don't really know if you had
the job to film for a famous youtuber
who would it be I would love to film for
jenna Marbles I think that would be so
funny because her videos crack me up so
I can only imagine how funny she is off
camera and in between you know that
takes that she actually puts in her
videos um I think that'd be so so so
funny I would love that job so I hear me
Jenna those are all the questions that I
screenshotted and safe for this video
but now I'm just quickly can I go
through my timeline and see if I can
pull out any other ones real quick cuz I
don't really feel like ending this video
who is your favorite person to watch on
youtube um that beyond beauty chick too
pretty
do you guys have internet via what are
you doing life are you attempting
beautycon LA in August yes i am you will
see me there I don't know what I'm going
to be doing there yet but I will keep
you guys in a loop when I find out what
youtuber would you like to punch the
most before I eat him and before I poop
on him I would probably punch justice
cojone well I believe I've been talking
for long enough so i'm going to end up
today's video here but if you guys liked
it give it a big thumbs up or a small
thumbs up it really doesn't matter and i
will see you guys very soon bye we're
sure when you go to the beach if you're
