be doing a quick out for the day and I'm
sorry I know that in my last video was
also not the outfit of the day but um I
really like my outfit today and I just
want to show you guys so I'm sorry I
hope you're okay with me making the same
video twice in a row I'm so frozen to
start out with hair and makeup and it's
like before school so I'm kind of in a
hurry so makeup all I have it's just a
bunch of eyeliner on the top and then
halfway on the bottom and a bunch of
mascara
of course cuz I love mascara and then
smooth lips and then my hair this is
like my natural hair when I just wake up
from it but today decides to put it down
like a middle part just because I never
really do that and I think it looks cute
and then ooh gotta brush my hair okay
and then for earrings I have these
they're like teardrop shaped earrings
with hearts inside and these are from
forever 21 and then that's all that I
have for Julie and then my nails are
like black french tips and that is
because today is actually Friday and we
have our little graduation dance
graduating from 8th grade and I'm gonna
show you guys my outfit for that too as
well and I'll put a bunch of pictures
and make it like a cute little video but
that would be like uploaded later but
that's tonight so my dress is black so I
decided to make black french tips and so
we show you guys I'm happy now okay
pretty short so I'm sorry but that's how
I like them
why did I go back down okay so these
shorts are from Abercrombie heavily sure
and then this shirt which you guys have
seen me have before well my shirts from
forever 21 and it has a really cute like
detail right here of like I don't know
looks like that it reminds me of like
tribal or something and then I tucked it
into my jeans
just cuz you know I don't know I felt
like it's all like the flowy now just
cute so that's my outfit from down to up
and then my shoes I'm just wearing these
you guys have seen me wear these before
too
they're just okay they're just black
sandals like this with a bunch of gems
on them okay how am I gonna do this
there you go
is that so that is an outfit pretty
simple but yeah I like it so I'll see
you guys for another video probably it's
gonna be like a video about my
graduation dance and stuff like that
