have a ten minute at home booty workout
no gym membership no equipment required
this is for beginners it's super easy it
really makes your bum burn you notice
Bill amazing as well I'll be explaining
the pose and the exercises before I do
them and then we're going to do about 10
reps of each exercise and we're going to
go over again afterwards and do it all
over again do it every day - I do it
every few days telly up to you but the
more you do it the more you will feel
the burn
and it's so going to your booty and
before we get right into it I am NOT a
personal trainer nor my certified in any
way shape or form so my form in some
poses some enzymes may not be 100%
correct we will get stuck Genesis make
sure we have some water ready and a lip
get started and you can do this
following workout anywhere I just do get
my lounge right now there's a small
little place here and this is where I'm
going to be doing my workout so the
first I'm going to do and deliberate a
warm-up to get some blood running
through our booty and get it's nice and
warm so the first thing you want to do
is to get on all fours and we're going
to start off by doing a dolphin kick so
what you want to do with the donkey is
use it in like a right angle to go up
like that and it's down and you will do
an exact same on this side as well we're
going to start wetting pant on exercise
so let's get started
and ten and then we swap over to the
other leg
easy next to everything on to kick-start
that becomes actually life is pumping
the egg but trust me it really works
your beauty what we want to do is lie on
your back like this and then you want to
make sure that your ankles are spread
quite far apart that your feet are
facing outwards so that your weight is
on your heels and you just simply lift
up weird your bum and then come down
again the best way to think of it is to
imagine if you have a pencil in between
bunches and trying to squeeze it and
hold it there
weird image with trusted agent work
we're going to start by doing ten normal
hip grunt so get ready and go
so this bring you to lower angle so you
can see crumply what we're going to do
this time is we're going to cross one
leg over a leg like that and then we're
going to mix once again 10 each leg just
with one leg this time so get ready and
go
Oh
and then switch legs and
really make sure is squeezing about
but this first Alone's we're going to do
you want to put one leg on a couch or a
chair anything like that and go a little
bit further forward like this and what
you want to do with these lunges is you
want to make sure that your balance goes
down and then up against a new 10 on
each leg so in three two one
let's go one
three
see
Hey nine and I'm good good party
so are we go ahead and change legs and
then we're going to do this again
so three two one one
two three four five six
seven eight nine and ten now if you've
never done a squat before just imagine
your right to sit on a chair like that
so it's five downer to go to sit on the
chair is what you want to do for your
squat make sure your legs are
shoulder-width apart
and squat down like you're sitting on
chair and then up and then squeeze
inward and I'll show you from this angle
what you want to do is sit back in the
chair up and weird opposed you can the
top so I'm going to go ahead and do it
ten squats so in three two one
make sure that you're pushing with your
heels and got your toes 12 easy 10
sponsor now to do some pulse lunges so
similar to what we did before but this
time you want to make sure that you lean
out into the nice lunge and you're gonna
want to come down but on the way up and
stop and you come down against it's a
constant lunch so ready in 3 2 1 1 2 3
Oh
by
seven eight nine
peg legs ready 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Hey nine and hey it's now the halfway
point to make sure to have a drink have
a very quick rest I'm going to do the
circuit once again so those that want a
little bit more challenge I recommend in
a second at least three times and adding
a little bit of weight in there as well
it will give you the best results but as
a beginning to workout that's going to
keep it nice simple and easy for those
that have literally got anything before
in their life
so now you've caught your breath it is
time to start that second once again
we're going to start again in dumb kick
so three two one one
