today we're doing the end of yeah babe
roads I'm going to do everything in
order of my application on my face I'm
going to start with privately good a
foundation make it to others that's how
we're going to do the favorites today I
thought it would make a lot more sense
to go in order of the products I use and
all that kind of stuff so let's jump
straight into it so one of my favorite
two primers for 2015 has been it is the
toothpaste hangover primer I love this
primer because I feel like it literally
revitalizes and it energizes and
hydrates your face some of our energizes
hydrates your face it doesn't say that
it has coconut water in it probiotic
base ingredient and skin revive is and
it's still looking free and I just feel
like every single time he's in my face
it's so soft and smooth my second
favorite foundation of the year has been
the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation
this one is in the shade one root by
three one five and as you guys saw I
recently did a first impression on this
and I've been using it a lot
for everyday use because I feel like the
best thing about this foundation is that
it looks like your skin it doesn't like
you're right here so you do seem to make
up and what a surprise my favorite
foundation of 2015 has been a a guy in
Barcelona
now this foundation from the moment I
started using it I pretty much use it
every single video I'm really sorry guys
I use it way too much of my videos but I
just love it that much that other
foundations okay but I find the
Barcelona is the perfect tent if you use
a loving 10/10 I mean perfect shade if
he's loving ten they are match made in
heaven
now my favorite concealer of 2015 it's a
little bit controversial because as you
guys know that the entire year I use the
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer but
within the last month I've ended up not
liking it anymore so I thought
not prevent my favorites because I don't
know I just don't like anymore it's
weird it may be straight up with me I
don't know so the favorite can see like
is the Smashbox high definition
concealer this one is in the shade light
and I honestly love it to death the
first time I use this is oh my god I was
filming as well the best time we use it
I just opened it and I thought oh no
really have a squeezy concealer cheap
before I would look they went all over
my face like a full foundation of like
my favorite powder of the entire year
has been the NARS pressed powder in
theat just has come to a sad end for me
I actually when I was in LA was looking
in Sephora and so on to pick this up and
I couldn't find anywhere so done
everything stopped selling it makes your
makeup last such a longer than it would
without the powder as well and I cannot
present enough it is my favorite color
of all time not just the year the
favorite bronzer of 2015 has been at the
balm Bahama Mama bronzer I absolutely
love the packaging of this to start off
with anyway I think it's so colorful and
beautiful and this is the color of the
bronzer inside so this is a really
natural bronzer I love it because it's
so bendable really easy to work with and
I find it's not muddy at all with a lot
of my other bronzers they end up looking
really muddy on me and it looks like I
just like rolled around and poof or
something which is similar to a bronzer
but kind of like a bronzer highlight no
and you guys already know what I'm going
to pick up is the Mac of gulten posit I
called it soft and gentle on camera for
so long and I can't believe I didn't
realize that until like a month ago
basically skull deposit and it is the
most beautiful things I've ever laid my
eyes on in my life how many times I've
used some videos guys like I love it
and my other favorite the highlight of
2016 has been the Becca champagne pop by
Jack and he'll me how can you not love
it if you haven't watched it on your
hand go to your nearest makeup shop
swatch it on your hand and I go into
your buy it now from the skies it's been
really tough because I can actually
choose between three I have three
favorites because they're all really
different not explain why they're all
really different the first one is the
benefit roller lash and the reason why I
love roller lash is because it's super
thin and it makes your lashes really
long it's just really lengthens and it's
beautiful and I love it
the other one that I chose is the Too
Faced better than sex mascara and the
reason why and the reason I love this
mascara is because of the volume that
makes my eyelashes too for like thick
and like when you walk in the room
everyone's like my other favorite is the
NARS audacious mascara and I love this
mascara because I feel like it's the
best of both cars it volumizes
antlers didn't say roller lash better
than sex and audacious are my three
favorites my favorite eyeliner of 2015
has been the English eyeliner gel I love
this eyeliner because for starters like
I've used a lot of it and it doesn't dry
out like it has not dried out on me at
all and I do so much of it and this
proves so much less one of the only
island is I have which it's black cuz a
lot of them go like gray or they kind of
fade and look really weave but that is a
black eyeliner and it's amazing and two
thumbs up to you England you're amazing
favorite eyebrow product of 2015 has
been named a deep dark brunette
fluidline brow gel cream I love this
because Lexi like the formula is
actually a lot smoother than the
yeah dipbrow brother it doesn't dry out
as fast as the dipbrow swell and
obviously I compare them because there's
the two or two very similar products but
I find that this one it just it's just
it's just better
I have two favorite eyeshadows of 2015
they're quite similar I guess but I love
them both equally as much the first one
is the Mac slow fast slow dazzled shadow
I love this because I feel like it is
just the most perfect little pink
eyeshadow then makes your eyes look so
sparkly and so beautiful as well so you
can see it kind of changes colors wrong
a lot but I use something like an
everyday basis because it's so glittery
it's so beautiful and guys it's amazing
my second favorite eyeshadow has been
the Kat Von D raw power eyes shadow this
is the most pigmented thing I've ever
seen in my life it is so stunning and
beautiful and I use this a lot just like
the look just on my entire lid you can
kind of see that the two I show is quite
similar my fingers there but this is a
lot darker and the Mac ones a lot more
like a sparkling gorgeous gorgeous color
I have two favorite lip liners of 2015
and they're both from Mac they are
spiced and sought and I actually picked
up spiced first and then I got saw
second but spiced the more brownie one
is perfect for more velvet teddy and my
other favorite has been saw and the
reason why I like saw so much is because
it's more like my natural lip color I
just use this and a bit of lip balm it
makes my lips like oh wait again and I
love that I really love that I don't
know you whoa hello and I don't know
what I did my bullet line there like I
feel like I have to put on like one
every day now because it makes me feel
sort from confident my second favourite
lipstick
of 2015 has been the Anastasio Beverly
Hills
liquid lipstick in Veronica and I use it
on my 21st as well and it lasts all
night all my drinks and I went through
and everything it was amazing favorite
lipstick of 2015 without a doubt has
been Mac's modesty I love this lipstick
because it is the best natural lipstick
ever it's so creamy on your lips so
hydrating Sophie only lipstick that I
have the Mac doesn't drop my lips it's
so nice and your lips I just makes them
feel so beautiful
I love is lipsticks so much I really do
now for too little like extras I guess
my favorite sunglasses of the entire
year have been the key Australia white
my girls I got these in LA at the
toothpaste world at the toothpaste event
that I attended key was clamoring with
them and we could all choose per Sonny's
and I chose these thinking like Oh white
something is I was like that's not gonna
look good on me at all and then I tried
them on I was like what I love these
these are amazing they finally went
favorite fragrance of the entire year
has been black or PM thank you so much

scent I love it so much I love the
