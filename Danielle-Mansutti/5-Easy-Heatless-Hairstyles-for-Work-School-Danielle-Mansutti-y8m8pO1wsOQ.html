channel today I've done my first
hairstyles video I can't with five quick
and easy hairstyles for you guys for
school work or just everyday occasions
this is a lot of stuff that I used to do
when I was at school or uni or work or
that kind of stuff so all this stuff is
stuff that can be done in like a minute
once he sort of master after the first
time it's a lot easier I try to keep it
as simple as possible for you guys so I
really hope that you guys enjoyed how
many times my guys and since let's get
straight into it so the things that
you'll need today are hair ties hair
bubbles hair bands elastics whatever you
call them in your country I call them a
hair ties so yeah it's got my hair all
over it but you'll need one of these
you'll also need a donut these things
are super cheap you can just get them at
like Dollar Stores and what kind of
stuff and you will also need either hair
grips everyone so that differently I
don't know why there's so many words for
these things it's so weird so I don't
have my hair extensions in or anything
like that so this is my hair lip and
from the back it is this length so it's
sort of like medium length hair it's not
as long as my hair is with extensions or
anything like that and yeah the first
thing that we are going to do today our
milkmaid braids this is a hair cell
which has been all over YouTube lately I
have worn this heads down before and
people either love it or they think you
look crazy so it's totally personal
preference me personally I really like I
could never look cute so I'll show you
how to do that right now
what you're going to need is two hair
elastics or hair ties and you're gonna
just want to make sure that your hair's
parted down the middle like that into
two sections and you just want to begin
braiding each dive your hair
and it doesn't matter if it's super
messy or anything because with my
hairstyles I tend to be messier than I
do Nate I just think it looks really
cool when you had a little bit more mess
even super crazy nice pigtails a pretty
cute
so now take the will either side fine
I'm going to start with my left side and
you're gonna want to wrap it over the
top of your head like this so you wrap
it over like that once you've got it
over your head you're gonna want to grab
some bobby pins and just pin it down
onto your head and I've got a little bit
sticking out but we will fix up so with
this side what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
make sure that my hair is covering the
bobby pins that we just had this and
then I'm going to put that over this
side and then I'm going to tuck it
underneath the other right like this and
then as you can see my hands like waving
out so I'm just going to grab it and
then tap my head into the phrase so now
he's gonna grab it up some bangs from
the side sorry I'm talking dark and the
only hot thing about this hairstyle is
just painting back all the loose or sort
of baggy strands if that makes any sense
but besides that it's super easy and you
feel really like Princess Leia but it's
all good now for the second hairstyle
we're going to want to throw my hair
over to one side like just and then you
want to just tile her in a side ponytail
I'm just gonna pull out my stress first
and now take a doughnut or a scrunchie
and just go about halfway and place your
hair through the doughnut like this and
then sort of put your hair around it
this way and start like turning it
inside out so we're going to want to
constantly go in this sort of question
and turn everything inside out and make
sure that your hair is covering all of
the donut and now all these little
strands here
we're just going to wrap these around
and then I'll grab a hair tie and you're
gonna want to pop it over like this and
then if you have any little strands
hanging out just and wrap it around the
donut like that and then we want to just
sort of give our hair a bit of a tease
and then pull out any it strands so we
have a cute little side bun and this is
so quick and easy to do it's just the
fastest hairstyle for work or something
like that and it's really cute and messy
and yeah I love it
another the next hairstyle you're gonna
want to grab a hair brush and just grab
a big section of your hair from the top
of your head like this
and give it a tease to make sure that
your hair is quite teasing it's got a
lot of volume and then you want to just
twist the hair
and then pin it down
now we're gonna grab the front strands
of our head I just from your pot down
got these front strands and we're gonna
stop writing them to the end of the head
I used to do this hairstyle all the time
at school and I used to get sawed off
for doing it although it's cool because
we won't love to have our hair down at
all but I was rebellious I'm just going
to hold that in place with a there's
nothing about these two braids we're
going to just want to wrap it around the
back of our head like this and then a
little bit and then we're going to want
to hide the bobby pin that we have at
the back so we got to do is just wrap it
around the back like that and find where
your bobby pins work and then just bring
them both together so that like that and
then tie it up
and then feel free to start pulling out
any strands that you want to make more
volume and body for your hair because I
hate having flat hair and then we have a
very cute half updo style here the next
hairstyle that I'll be showing you is
the one that I wore to the blonde
Dyson's one nice hands event a few
months ago and a lot of you guys were
asking to see it so I thought I would
include it in this video so I'm just
going to make sure that I have a middle
part and then what you want to do is you
want to actually grab all the hair from
halfway here down such as remind your
fingers down like that and then separate
the hair so just for now I'm just going
to throw over extra hair back and tie it
up so now with these are front strands
that we have works you're going to be
braiding the whole of this hair so you
want to start by running your fingers
through like that and grabbing the top
section and then from the top section
you want to be braiding as close to your
roots as possible so start doing a
normal braid like this and then as you
go you want to pick up the hair that's
sitting here as well and start adding
that to the braid and then pick up all
the extra hair and then continue
braiding and then I'm just going to give
them a tug and just loosen up them
braids a little bit
there was going to be taking out that
hair from back and now just take all of
your hair like this and make sure that
it's all going in the same sort of
direction and then you're just going to
want to tie it into a ponytail and now
grab the donut that we had before just
run your hair over it like that and then
just make sure that as much hair as
possible is around the actual story nut
so you know you can't actually see it
and then just place a hair tie over the
top wrap those around doing that and now
start pulling your hair to get some
volume just grabs the strands from
either side and start just giving you a
bit of a tease and then this is the bun
done yeah and now the last hairstyle I
will show you is the a quick and easy
messy bun perfect for work or school and
this was like my go-to look it's going
to love doing his hairstyle cuz it took
about 40 seconds to do in the morning
once a sort of massive 40 seconds is
pretty specific but it you know taking
it not long at all is what I'm trying to
say put your hair into a ponytail but I
don't have the paint out in the middle
of your head so I was going to type my
hair in the middle
and firstly I'm actually going to grab
my front strands because they're apt for
this look so I going a little donut once
again we're just going to wrap it around
the hair and then make the hair go
around the ponytail just grab the
elastic I'm place it over your head like
this
and then with the strands on either side
we are just going to plat those or braid
through sorry
and then tuck them into the penet eye
and now described a pin and pin all the
loose parts and now I'm just going to
grab my fingers right through my hair
and just pull all the sides out because
I want this to be really messy just keep
teasing it until we are happy with the
volume of your hair and then you have an
easy little messy bun thank you guys so

hairstyle is a video I really hope that
