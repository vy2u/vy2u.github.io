today I've done a quick and easy
five-minute hair and makeup tutorial so
if you'd like to see how I got from left
to right and please keep watching I'm
using the Garnier BB cream in medium
today it matches my tan and it just
looks like my skin with that being too
hard on the coverage so it's perfect
it's like an everyday use I found that
actually lasts a long time as well which
is awesome then moving on to concealer
I'm using the it cosmetics bye bye
under-eye I know this is the smallest
version of it ever and I'm just going to
buff this underneath my eyes just
because I feel I need a bit more
coverage today because my eyes are likes
to be veiny without makeup on
then using roller lash by Benefit I'm
just going to apply a small coat of this
onto my top and bottom lashes I'm using
matte gold deposit on my cheeks for a
bronzer and a highlight because it's
like a sparkling bronzer and I love it
so I'm putting it on my cheeks my
temples and my chin
then using the sort lip pencil from Mac
I'm just going to over line my lips a
little bit and then what I like to do is
actually just get a lip balm and put it
over the top and then you just don't see
the line from the lip liner all blends
together and looks really natural and
looks like you have a big full lips so
it's amazing I using the Sigma brow
powder I'm just using this on my
eyebrows just to fill them in very
quickly and just fill in all this fast
empty areas so makeup is now complete
how easy was that
now we're going to move on to hair
because it's needing a little bit of
loving it's a bit what's going on so I'm
going to use the new meat
titan-3 set today I love new me products
I've been using them for years now and
they're such great quality as well so I
definitely definitely recommend them and
I'm going to be using the big fat 32
millimeter one today as I'm waiting for
it to heat up I'm just going to tie up
the top portion of my hair into a top
knot
I really think the Titan three is my
favorite new me product because it's
really really easy to use don't really
know what happened here though oh yeah I
decided to just use a really big chunks
of my hair today
I don't want tight curls want really
loose wavy beachy curls as you can see I
picked up a really big fat piece of hair
and I'm putting it around my wand and
I'll leave it on there for about five to
10 seconds I don't wanna leave it on for
too long
and the new me Holiday Collection has
lots of great deals that make a really
nice stocking stuff of your loved ones
you have to reach order by from the nume
Holiday Collection before December 15th
so you will get your orders on time for
Christmas so I have some coats for you
guys I hope you're excited if you want
to get 20% of the entire holiday
collection use the code Danny Holiday if
you want to get $89 at any set and free
us shipping use the code Danny love and
I'll leave all extra info in the
description but something you really
don't want to miss out on guys like ah
so I tied up like a beard I know this
looks really weird but this is just to
ensure that I can brush out the hair
which hasn't been cold yet so starting
with a top section of my hair and
grabbing another big fat chunky piece
and I'm going to curl it away from my
face so I definitely would recommend if
you've ever thought about getting new me
products it now is definitely the time
because these deals are pretty
unbelievable
so I left I want to show you how long I
actually do leave it on with an editing
or anything like that just a really
short time and in such a short time it
looks like this it's time to move on to
the next side and just continue what I'm
doing away from my face
and this is the finished look once it's
all brushed out you can do whatever you
want with it you can flip it over you
can try and tie it up in a ponytail like
this it actually looks really nice if
you tie it up really good for like work
or school it's like really effortless
and pretty I hope you guys enjoyed this
simple hair and makeup tutorial and I'll
see you really soon bye hello guys
