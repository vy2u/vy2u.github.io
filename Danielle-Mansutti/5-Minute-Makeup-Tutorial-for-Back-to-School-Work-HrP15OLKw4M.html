a little bit because I do take quite
long time to get ready normally I want
to make a really quick and easy 5 minute
makeup tutorial for sort of like back to
school or work which is everyday use so
I come up with this look here I really
hope you guys enjoy this tutorial it's a
little bit of a mixture of like high-end
and drug stores so I really hope you
enjoyed and let's jump into this so
every headband is going on and now we
are ready to start I could be using a
mixture of drugstore and high-end
today's really excited with Maybelline
fit me a matte and poreless foundation
now this is in the shade three one zero
I think I really just like is the fact
this little pump
ah that is a lot of foundation oh my
goodness this foundation is seriously
like my favorite drugstore foundation
ever it is so what for letting good you
can see that we're using one of my old
favorites which is the Maybelline
instant age rewind concealer this one is
in the shade light it has been a long
time since I've uses concealer but it is
seriously my favorite drugstore
concealer ever it is so what good and we
go ahead and blend this in with my
Beauty Blender
I actually didn't realize how much I
missed it until right now like damn the
path today I'm going to use the Rimmel
stay matte powder this one is in the
shade Caesar for sandstorm it's going to
quickly brush this all over the face to
get everything in place because if
you're going to school or work you want
to make sure that your makeup is not
dripping off over the day I've been
there before trust me don't give myself
some eyebrows to actually frame my face
I'm going to use the and it starts
building hills dipbrow in a dark brown
if you're very lucky and don't need to
fill in your eyebrows and please don't
because you can say so much time but for
me I'm changes very very very fast just
to fill in this side of my brow
now that brows are done it is time to
put on some a bronzing this is a very
fancy version of the nozzle Laguna
bronzer and it comes with the little
eater brush I absolutely love it it's so
sweet I'm not using like a contour kit
everything today just this little
bronzer and it's like so not blended out
right now I'm just packing it on right
now then we're going to blend it out
afterwards now I just quickly learn that
upwards and outwards I'm going to use
the benefit a roller lash to apply
subscribe to my eyes and make me look
less like a big moon and give me
something on my face I think I look so
scary that mascara it's so funny it's
like I was going to apply some onto our
lashes very quickly and that would be a
Nastasia Beverly Hills a glow kit I'm
going to use golden bronze to highlight
and I'm going to mix it with a little
bit of sunburst I'm actually thinking of
being super sneaky and actually putting
a bit over lids as well just very
lightly on the crease and now with this
beautiful color here we're going to use
that as a tiny little highlight
and then also in the inner corners and
I'll finish you off for this NARS lip
cover in the shade get dirty I was just
going to offer several lips
this color is so natural and so gorgeous
so here is the finished look it took
just under five minutes yeah thank God I
was like how am I going to do this is
number five minutes but I did it I'm
very amazed that I could do it in five
minutes okay so this look would be
really great school work or like come
and start but if you do regret it and
please let me know I hope you guys have
an amazing day thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you all very soon
