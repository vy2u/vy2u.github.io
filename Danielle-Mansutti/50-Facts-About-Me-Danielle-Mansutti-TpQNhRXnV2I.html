channel today I've decided to do in the
hooptie random facts about me tag I
can't believe I've never done this
before I was just looking out a date on
my subscriptions and I saw that's
telling Jo had done one race clean I'm
like I should probably do that
I probably my home number yet and at the
end of this video please write down the
comments and facts about UQ's
he's so cool for us to get to know some
really weird and read things about each
other so I took a a phone to write
down 50 random things about me but I
have a more on my phone and I will be
reading them out the day so if you like
to get to know me better then please
keep watching I've always felt like I'm
a bit of bad dancer
it's just something which doesn't really
come naturally to me if I'm out
somewhere at a festival or something
I sort of like watch how are people
dancing and I'm like how come I just
doesn't come naturally to me and I'm
just over there looking like what I was
inflatable like things you see it like
customs is black I love riding creative
writing poetry all of it my favorite
flavor of crisps are salt and vinegar I
am obsessed I am very short-sighted I
cannot see anything without my contacts
or my glasses on and my description is
minus 3.75 I Drive a Jeep Wrangler and I
love it so much the petrol is so
expensive I was wondering whether to
include this but when I was younger I
was obsessed with marine scape it was an
online game and I was so obsessed with
it to the point I played it every single
day I was about 10 I think when I was
playing it and one of my characters got
like 99 it's level it was like the
biggest accomplishment of my little life
no socks that's a bit and I got scammed
on it so many times and oh I'm actually
like sweating from my top leg right now
so I'm going to tell my fan on sorry if
it's really actually find that I do
really love adrenaline I know a lot of
people say that and they don't really
mean it but I love rollercoasters the
faster the crazier the better I went in
a helicopter in October and I'm so
excited that was amazing I really want
to skydive do like and stuff but one
thing I do not want to do is find a
jumping
I've tried laser hair removal and I
hated it so much it was seriously the
worst pain of my life and I don't know
what it is everyone I've ever asked has
been fine with it
some reason it was like torture to me I
hated it so much I have never ever
broken a bone the only tea that I will
drink is Tetley extra strong English
breakfast tea independent arthouse our
films are my favorite kind of films to
watch I really have this huge love for
the water the times that I've
experienced snorkeling in the Great
Barrier Reef and stuff with the most
magical and amazing experiences I really
really really want to scuba dive one day
I'm a big lover of books and I love
reading I've had my nose bellybutton is
one two three four five six seven
pierced in the past I now only have my
belly and that's it I took out all my
ear piercings I don't even know why I
just never wearing so thanks wherever I
am not Australian I'm half Italian and
half English I am a really lazy reply
with emails and texts and messages I'm
one of those people that reads it and
then for some reason my head thinks that
I reply to it by reading it
and I didn't then I realized a few days
that I'm like oh sorry I suck at
throwing I'm pretty bad and any sort of
ball sport games like mm-hmm thank you I
don't know if you guys notice this one
but I'm someone that doesn't leave wear
clothes that show cleavage at all I
never was that which is plunging or
anything like that I just feel very
uncomfortable wearing stuff that shows
village I am a Scorpio my favorite fizzy
drink is 11 lime in theaters before
YouTube I was planning on being an
artist or a graphic designer and I used
to paint nearly every single day I have
been to five different schools I grew up
with guys around me all the time I
didn't grow up with dolls and girls and
like pink things everything so I've
always found it a lot easier to connect
with guys thing girls I have this really
weird thing with butter my entire life
if I eat but I instantly feel sick with
milk ice cream and yogurt I'm completely
fine but with butter and cheese it makes
me feel so safe my carnitas it's not
really around in fact you guys all know
this but I'm obsessed with bugs in my
life I have had purple hair light brown
hair dark brown hair fully blonde hair
pink hair orange hair oh my gosh and red
him my head still my head how does it
even work I can play the piano
personally I find it really hard to be
in crowds makes very happy when I go out
somewhere or go to festivals being in
crowds makes me feel extremely
claustrophobic it makes me just want to
like run away as far as I can so I try
to avoid places with crowds as much as I
can I'm five foot ten last time I
checked I can be so wrong I am a checked
in so long but I think I do five foot
ten one of the things I love more than
anything else is meeting someone who has
a big open mind
actually have deep conversations with me
I have an old brother and he is two
years older than I am
I'm not that glitzy or girly I never
wear jewelry because this doesn't come
naturally to me if I'm going to an event
or something I'm at the effort to wear
jewelry but I've always grown up way
more of a tomboy then a really kind of
glitzy really well put together kind of
girl I love baking if I can't be
creative like filming writing editing
painting drawing whatever for a long
period of time it actually stresses me
out and I get really really pretty tense
growing up I was never into makeup and I
never really was until about four or
five years ago steep house can always
make me dance always I was always really
shy really quiet and really insecure
growing up and my report card would
always say she is a very quiet nice girl
but she needs to participate more in
class my parents are still together and
they have been married for 28 years
I am a procrastinator but the one I put
my mind to something I worked so hard in
it and do not let anything distract me
but that only really happens like once a
week it's very right I am very very very
good at keeping secrets I try not to ten
outside anymore
I find the dangers of skin cancer
especially in Australia way too
terrifying so that's why I only really
fake tan now when I was in high school I
used to do every single week when I had
PE class orgonite and fried it in my
mom's handwriting pretending to be her
as well I could skip PE class
oh you watch my videos mum and um sorry
I studied Mandarin in high school and I
also lived in China for five weeks with
my school when I was a year right
my eyebrows off with a razor because mum
wouldn't let me get them plucked so I
rebelled and shaved off my eyebrows that
was such a bad decision
okay the web is next door starting again
I'm sorry if they can hear them I just
can't make them stop it's so annoying
anyway I find it really hard to shout I
find it really hard to raise my voice or
shout out anything which is why when in
videos I get excited or something I kind
of do more of like a mood and he's a
client scream what I try to scream i
voice breaks and goes all over the place
because I just pretty much my life never
scream or shout or anything and my voice
has no idea what I'm doing when I try to
do it my favorite comfort food of all
time is Maltesers and salted popcorn
mixed together Wow so we're good you
guys have to try it had to pop some
popcorn
put some more teasers in the bag shake
it up and then eat it trust me you'll
take me I'm actually not a very big fan
of ice cream ice cream doesn't appeal to
much and I don't really like it so the
Lion King was my favorite movie when I
was a child I don't drink coffee I love
the smell but I can't I just can't get
used to the taste I wish I could drink
it though but like honestly I'm actually
a huge IT nerd at heart I know a lot
about computers a lot about programming
about HTML and a lot about pretty much
everything on the internet the Internet
is like my special little place where I
really understand what's and that is my
50 facts about me I hope you enjoyed
learning if you couldn't read things
about me and if you could leave down
below some facts about you it'd be
amazing if we could all get to know each
other a little bit better that thing so
thank you guys so much for watching and
I'll be seeing you really soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
