today fear I have you really easy
back-to-school hairstyle because school
is around the corner I thought it's like
the perfect opportunity for you guys to
practices have gel they are super easy
they're super quick and it's for job
right into the area if you haven't
already subscribed to my channel then
all you have to do is hit that button
down below I set up two new videos every
single week and I would love you to be
part of the family so that further ado
let's get into it
this first cell is so easy and so cute
all you want to do is just type it here
into a really high tight ponytail and
then what you want to do is just braid
the ponytail down completely and then
you just wrap it around your head and
you pretty much done and I like to grab
some hair at the sides as well just kind
of like thing that's the effect but it's
pretty self-explanatory it's super easy
and it looks so so pretty as well I can
still please just with you are
hope it's not a delusion
c'mere cinema tell me the next hairstyle
is very similar but we're not going to
braid it this time we're just going to
put our hair into a really really high
ponytail but not tire and instead we're
just going to wrap it around our thumb
like this and then put a hair tie over
the top
you start simple this side twists are
one of my favorite cuz it looks so good
but it literally takes you five seconds
all you want to do is grab some hair
from the front of your head twist it
around and tight at the back and it is
literally about easy
they're gonna keep writing what we're
going to do is grab some hair from the
side of my head and as we braid
downwards what you're going to grab more
hair as we go you can see that I grab
some hair from the back and then by the
time that we get to the bottom I'm just
going to braid it all together and then
continue on the other side strongest and
the weakest part thing and then when
it's all done I like to mess it up a
little bit get a few hairs out I really
like to pull on the braid if it adds
more volume just to me I'm sorry
money's a month
I can still please goose with you are
this half up bun is so cute and so easy
do is grab the hair near your eyebrows
and tie it backwards and then twist like
we do the top knot and then you have the
bug complete it is so simple step to the
side braid you're going to want to put
your hair in a side parting this time
and literally a self explanatory as it
is you just grab three chunks of hair
and you start braiding it downwards mess
it up a little bit get some hairs out
and it looks so cool and no one's going
to know it that you compute like bugs a
good
I love the milkmaid braids because so
cute and they're so fun
all your going to do is braid each side
of your hair and then you pop it on the
top of your head I like to secure mine
with bobby pin when I come to a second
braid I like to disguise it by kind of
hiding it in the first braid and then
securing it with a bobby pin so it looks
like a master thank you for watching
today I hope that the texture was
helpful for you please let me know if
you decide to recreate them I would love
to see them on Instagram to dog gets
angry monster you guys win next year ah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
