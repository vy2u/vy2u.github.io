today's yeah I have a bunch of PR
packages to open a third open on screen
because last time you asked them to love
that and we can just discuss them review
them swatch them all that good stuff so
before I jump straight into it you can
already subscribe to my channel I would
love to have you on board
I upload two new videos every single
week I would love to have you here and
without further ado and I should've do
it
so like baines's join me so this is
opening holes all so the first amount of
an eye open is this local package any
echo package is just like so we have
some skin stuff but we have these two
babies right here this one is a
revitalizing climber this one is a
brightening mask this one is the
revitalizing oh they're all filled
I assume this would be like a dark color
and the other one the brightening my
impression will be a lot color I want
that you guys my blog about how these
are and everything I'm sure they'll be
amazing everything from Oprah is amazing
I know you guys have tried Oprah's Wanda
lush the moisturizer that I can clash
with Kim it is so good it's like my
favorite moisturizer hands down Lee has
everything any other skincare I'm like
I'm here for that okay next we have got
a monster delivery from Meg's everything
another something macarons and disco
balls this is so cool okay it says hi
Danielle ever wish your favorite
eyeshadow came in every finish
imaginable I'm here ultimate multicenter
shadow paths are each packed with full
vibrant shades and three mesmerizing
finishes from map to shimmer and
sparkling metallics
oh yes we have this one which is right
on my tree is how it's looking on the
inside
let's watch the middle row because
that's what my eyes like looking
daughter's see are the top two mice
watching is not the best backwards so go
ahead and read it as much just because
I'm like if anything would shake the
camera might as well so let me try again
Sierra the swatches we've just once what
on the top right here's the middle row
oh oh wow that is nice it's very hot
let's watch the sugar on the bottom you
ready oh my god that is so pretty I love
the fact that is literally the same
colors
oh wait I'm so dumb
I didn't realize the whole point of a
palette I was like it's like all had all
the same colors and different finishes
and yeah that's what it's all one note
that I just forgot this one is a cool
time palette something that my hands
don't normally touch so here's the next
one
it is us po7 smokescreen that bluest
pigment is Oh still go get that one on
there now we're go ahead and do the
middle row oh my god it's crazy a
pigmentation difference between these
two because of the formulas now finally
the shimmer so that one I think the
pigmentation is definitely strongest in
the middle one
now here's what the other two in the Box
look like I think this one's very so
much fun when i swatched
this colorful one though is like whoa
thank you so much there next so I
thought for our level this sort of like
extra top of the package so you don't
have my address on it so probably like
show you the boss but it is remotely
look I think I've been by the cloppety
concealers what I'm not on their ampere
but they saw I think that's worth twice
about Jack and he'll multi palette and
they were like and we send you something
this week as I love you guys this is a
collaboration I don't know if Britney is
I'm shooting through the u.s. be the
influencer so these are the brushes on
the back actually has like a detailed
how-to
of how to use ur brushes which I
appreciate that it's very cool cool
a comes during my loving belly I am
going to use that color so much you guys
already know but not a part of them like
hello now I never watched a contour
palette before I mean after hulking
Kardashian disasters not that my bits
good about it I'm going to go ahead and
try anyway speed up the bronzing shade
this one was definitely the creamiest
which was a darker shade here
I haven't actually contoured in a long
time I know what a bit not just decided
to use bronzer instead now is anyone
else thing that I like I feel like the
contour trend was big like keynotes 2012
shows nothing
ish and now what's big now I figure out
a little bit fix and highlighters are
probably the biggest thing but
regardless I'm excited to try this
because I haven't used the contour
palette non-parent thank you very much
more see now this one I'm slightly
slightly slightly confused about the
calls it always kind of scared in the
package because I don't knows this
company I've never emailed this company
personally and it is my like management
told me anything about this company but
they've sent me something to my home
address and I'm always like how did you
go animagus I said it's not like a
hidden microphone or a camera or
something idiot I guess I thought what
about how do you know who this is
great story a story where did it come
from
so it came from California can we hear
my ass man I've no idea if I'm a godless
person so it says Danielle we're so
excited to send you a box hope you love
our sheet masks how do I have a card
actually computed by what to say what's
actually in here it happens a lot though
where like I get sent stuff under my
eyes to tell me about assets which might
be one of those things
oh this macaron mom that is cool and
they don't know if you can see it with
the light but if it's actually like 3d
really hard to explain why I don't think
you can see what I'm saying I think mrs.
Korean it doesn't like Japanese or
Chinese so I'm assuming these are all
in business class student' mosque park
that is really cool I must say very
unexpected but thank you very much that
it's very very very kind of you I'm
really kind of try it thing is that when
I get sent products that I can't read
the bus girls because it is in Korean I
get a little bit worried about being
gradient to what I am putting on my face
so you guys have another comments if you
use like Korean beauty products are they
reliable would you recommend them
because I've never really used them so
I'd love to hear something back from you
next we have another booth for our
delivery which eye shadow very very very
pretty
let's watch me swatch let's do this
color maybe like the brown balloon here
we go okay
there are the three colors there what
god this is disgusting this little light
makeup pipe Oh actually run out
literally I'll show my my collapse are
not gone so I'm like holding up with
dear life on this one I usually like the
cheat water Primark but it's actually
I'm going to miss Primark run at some
point
I mean flushing lies I think thing is I
don't really like where a lot of months
anyway like I'm a big sugar person and
this is just very cool toned for me okay
now this is what I'm talking about this
is a me palette these are all shimmers
from the looks of it so this is the
dazzling diamonds shadow palette I love
the look of this one so let's do a goal
a kind of warm orange which like my
favorite kind of shade ever castle maybe
like the cream oh wait I put it over
here that's the Audis guy okay oh oh
that's nice that's very nice and then
the other two
okay so the shimmers are really really
nice as I say a massive thank you to
open that delivery I'd love that
shimmery color at the Desmond diamond
one the next one was in a massive box
such as open she was inside and there
was one small box and there's a few open
to cavities in there as well I'll open
the box yet but we have one buy lipstick
which I can't open I'm gonna the other
kind there we go oh my god this is so
nice
it is a lipstick so says it is the five
special effects
a lip topcoat look at that one
I don't quite understand I think it's
just like a shimmery you put over your
lips yeah you know I just read a book
shine mama
long-lasting water-resistant lip top
coat so it's really hard to show you
this but I hope so you can kind of see
what it is
oh and there is my BAE in a small
version of the Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray I mean I use every single
day so thank you guys so much
now we have another one of that special
effects lipstick cover things
oh wait no it's not it's not so this is
their heavy metal eyeliner but
essentially that's what it looks like
have you match the winter liner this
when it's in the shade ac/dc and you
like it but I'll just text your
questions together although this is one
of the special effects lipsticks oh my
god isn't two times it is called reserve
my right you'll be able to see with my
lighting but it's actually kind of
greenish and purple all right that one's
a lot more pigmented than the other one
to share out close that's what the lip
top coat looks like okay and then we
have the Advocate razor sharp liquid
eyeliner Oh would you like to packaging
it's go oh good god hmm I love this okay
is what I quickly up the eyeliners just
watch like that transmitted onto my skin
so well and look how like glistening and
beautiful a gold is but it's very pretty
thank you haven't okay now let's see
what's in the box
okay this is not what I expected this is
a scarf from under here I think Oh the
brass box have a private family wrapped
has a brand we have to get that from oh
it's it's a Mexican beach blanket which
really I thought I was make out when I
thought I was God but now it makes my
hip this is so nice this make you think
Jenna actually this is really great I
also saw that hundreds of gems like she
month what I love it it's so pretty
thank you over the K okay coming through
with the beach goodies that is really
unexpected really kind of something that
I actually really like because it's just
so pretty I mean actually like whole
watching review videos because they're
really chill and nice to film I liked
the videos which is you and me talking
directly to each other and talking about
makeup or whatever it's just always so
much fun and the kind of video that I've
done with playing a background but not
actually watch just listen to it now
because otherwise when it comes to
actual watching YouTube videos but
that's beside the point
I'll see you guys in a few days have you
ever really week and into the next time
