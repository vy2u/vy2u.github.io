been feeling really under the weather at
the moment this is my look like first
thing in the morning when I spent the
entire day yesterday in the Sun and
forgot to take my cell screen with me I
wake up at 3 a.m. this morning and was
basically having a panic attack like
three hours I just couldn't get back to
sleep
I felt like breathless and shaky come on

it's raining outside I always would love
to go back inside right now

and different days and Auckland New
Zealand and I just got up and compare it
with some you have a proper bed yet one
of the most beautiful thing I found here
in Central Florida art we have the
Spanish moss on and I think it looks
like a little fairy tale the fairy tale
tree so different from anywhere else
I've lived I love it so much
how far along with that and the dog and
this is a town that I live in call them
in the north northern part of Sweden
well the hunger the business has been in
I fried egg Wow
we totally served in a restaurant yeah I
totally Scott buy bread honey bread
I'm playing went box and pretty much
ranking out because it was like
everything seriously noted any message I
don't like to something slime on your
time what do I love most in this world a
lot of the hottest questions I think you
do too ever ask I did have to think
about this what why when you ask what do
I love the Mars shy so so many things I
cannot choose one of them would be my
phone and our beautiful garden and
little flowers that you can get from it
it depends like there's a physical love
and there's you know feelings and
emotions and experiences I love as well
for example when I wanna go ahead or
like when I'm at work and costumers
refer to me by my name my name's had I
realized today for multiple reasons
because of multiple people is that I
really love good quality time with
people one-on-one not distracted by your
friends and just good quality
conversation
I like taking pictures and like editing
photos I like drawing as long as hearing
people talk about fashion and being
there I sign up on the top ultimately to
sharing some really enjoy the love from
one of the most probably my relationship
with my boyfriend
okay I know but I feel like what you
find someone you can laugh with joke
with have fun get annoyed and kind of
make up he just makes me so happy
the thing that I love the most is
Jonathan like my life just wouldn't be
complete without him
I love you more than anything you like
my best friend
the soulmate over a drink
Yuri is the best thing that's ever
happened to me it's what I love in life
honestly family over the past few years
and we have completed everything to meet
your family reveal around remaking you
are
I know I wouldn't be here without them
and I love them so much because I've
being away it's what matters most and
it's what laughs and what is the most
important and it's what we also kind of
leave life with the people that was
known and loved and they're the reason
why we can have such your life hi my
name is Ivana
I'm from Zurich Switzerland and what I
love the most are the little things or
moments in life that makes you happy
I'm on vacation right now that's why I'm
empiric because whenever I get the
chance if you now I have a kid
I definitely love puppies oh my goodness
I wish man a dog hey I love you
thank you hey happy birthday
if you're just looking outside
completely confirming that yes you do
have to go outside outside
your cookie that's not yours
that's not nice
you'd steal from you what he says no
night yeah we're very excited
hell yes
oh okay by me hmm - very much all the
hair that I can do like buddy play like
internet boxes are so different in real
life
you
he's a little scared of the water
six good
my god images device because I would not
be Who I am today if I did not have his
guidance this year and working a lot
more on self-love and accepting myself
and not holding myself to high
expectations especially with social
media and everything one thing I love
most is people and words are different
but at the same time everyone to think
wait
and the grand scheme of things the
things that I fear the most are failures
becoming old and being I'm happy to fly
I'm working so hard to push my
boundaries make sure I do everything in
life always worried about my
grandparents house something like two
breathing some expense that quite a lot
and it's really hard
we're here the most is probably being
alone I fear the most of being judged by
friends or family getting in a serious
accident or passing away those things to
get a crop out of me
my biggest fear which is well startled
it's just the fear of wasting my life
and wasting my time I just got home from
uni and me and my birthday book and for
my dead boyfriend Patrick we just ran
out food shopping and now we're just
making dinner and you want to say hi hot
Oh

lake
