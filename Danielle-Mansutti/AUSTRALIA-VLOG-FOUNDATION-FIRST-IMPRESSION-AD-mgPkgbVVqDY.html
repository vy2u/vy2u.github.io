where this whole channel was born it's
insane
I'm in Australia right now and I'm so
excited for this video today because
we're doing a first impressions and also
blogs to our video we are going to be
using a new foundation from one of my
favorite friends in the world which are
cover effects and it is this guy who is
the star of the show
this is the cover effects power play
foundation I am in the shade g50 because
I'm actually in Australia right now
because tomorrow is my cousin's wedding
I'm all fake turned up and ready for the
wedding tomorrow it's a little bit
darker than a foundation shade I would
normally pick but due to all this orange
and goodness we have going on right now
I picked a yellow shade for as well I'm
actually gonna take you with me the
other day because I need to go to
Chadstone which is a big shopping mall
because I need to actually dress but
tomorrow don't even have a dress yet
organised Queen right here I'm super
interested to find out how this goes
because I'm dying to find a new
foundation because I am like getting so
everyone I always use cover fix and I
are working on this video together to
show you this foundation I could not be
happier to be working with all my
friends in the world and I'd love to
thank coverfx this one's for me on this
video today no matter what my opinion is
of the foundation throughout the day you
will get my honest truth opinion I'm not
just going to say positive things
because it's sponsored I want you to see
for yourself if this is a really good
product and I'm sure it will be so let's
just jump into it and put this guy on
I'm feeling really weird doing such a
long intro with no makeup once I'm ready
to look normal again so I'm gonna put
this guy on I'm going to do half of my
face with a Beauty Blender and half of
my face with a cover FX a liquid
foundation brush that's what I see if it
makes any difference whatsoever so you
know that when you buy this foundation
if it is worth investing in a brush or a
Beauty Blender but first things first we
have to pry but is the cover FX
illuminating primer I wanna look glowy
and summery and nicer I think the
illuminating primer is perfect we go
ahead up a little bit don't to my face
not actually already making me look nice
and glowy that's what we like I'm so
tender at our nights I never faked and
my hands either so I'm a bit like oh my
god I actually match the ones what is
this and here is how the foundation
looks once you have it up I'm gonna
place a few drops onto the face so it's
going to start really small like this
and then work our way up and took a
blend this in with my Beauty Blender now
I actually have quite a lot of breakout
on my chin I'm not too sure what from
but I'm going to zoom you in let's go
ahead and see what happens
so it's actually covering these peoples
really nicely
this is extremely skin like I haven't
done my 40s if they'd ignore that but
this is just first first best first
impression I would have ordered out my
neck probably it is so natural and skin
like so far I'm loving it you can see
I've still got some pimples and stuff
here I've got to tie my knee right here
but you really just can't tell at all
which I'm so happy about because they're
just so annoying
I feel glowy I feel well covered we're
now gonna go ahead and use a cover fix a
liquid foundation brush just to see it
makes any difference whatsoever and
we're going to start putting it on this
side of the face
all right so the foundation is
completely on and I'm like loving it is
perfect color
the finish is like extremely skin like
it's covered everything that's also very
hot today outside I've also been up
since 4:00 a.m. with my jet lag so
there's lots of factors that are really
gonna push this foundation to really
test it today but for now let's continue
with makeup so I'm gonna be using this
cover effects cream concealer to pop
underneath my eyes isn't it also insane
like when you're feeling a bit tired or
a bit rundown or whatever
seriously just putting on a little bit
of makeup like how much different it
makes I think so it's hide this one my
jet lag but soon as I pop that
foundation on I'm really just like ah
I'm alive I'm always we're gonna set it
with a cover effects perfect setting
powder as well and with this I'm going
to take my Beauty Blender and I'm going
to dab the powder I don't think my eyes
will just put the concealer
it'll stop any creasing it will just add
the coverage and make the makeup last
throughout the day as well you know what
though I swear like as time goes on it's
actually better like I'm gonna zoom you
in so you can actually see fully clothed
very very impressed so thought so I need
to pull myself up I'm just using the
sunset cover effects bronzer with any
excess I'm just gonna go ahead and I'm
not along my crease my forehead that
makes a hell of a difference
will and in terms of this side because I
use a brush on the side I didn't find
too much difference in terms of the
finish however I did find that by using
a brush you do use significantly less
product because your bead Wendell
literally sucks away like any liquid it
can't know we're nice and Bryan's gonna
take it one step further with literally
in one of my favorite to cover FX
products of all time I'm sure you know
exactly what it is it is the cover FX
custom enhancer drops it's seriously
like the most beautiful thing I've ever
laid my eyes on it is just amazing there
we go let's blend
I've just finished blending that in like
can we just it's just not you know
mudding or anything it's so just like
sheer and beautiful and bright and I'm
gonna take some of the color effects she
might bail for my eyes I think I might
stick with I might stick with this one
which is called Soleil and for deepening
up my eyes a little bit I'm going to be
taking Italy and naked heat pallet and I
just finishing off the makeup look I'm
going to add some mascara as well so
that when makeup is on we have a one a
last step which we one of the most
important steps as well I'm using the
illuminating setting spray I actually
went to an event with Patrick Tarr not
long ago for color effects I learnt from
him and his little demonstration because
it's illuminating you want to do it
mainly spraying onto the sides of your
face but so much the front because
you're at the front to be too
illuminating because you don't it - kind
of like pick up and highlight any areas
that you just don't want out there so
I'm going to go ahead and I'm gonna
spray it onto the sides of my face only
what I loved about this is like it's
like it's such a fine mist it's not like
a super you know spring okay so I am all
set I'm all ready and I am absolutely
loving this foundation make new favorite
most likely if it does actually last out
the day this will quite quite easily
become my new favorite foundation and so
now I'm just looking forward to see how
this is gonna work out the day I think
it's gonna be incredible if it looks
like my skin the car match is perfect
the finish is perfect didn't oxidize
into any kind of like horrible yellow we
mess or anything and it lasts all day
and it's gonna be an easy ten and
without further ado let's get into the
blue part hey guys it's actually been a
few hours I have not actually got to the
shops yet my mom went to get her hair
done jeans just got back now so we're
actually gonna head out now
well my mom came back from her hair
point regime issues like your skin looks
so nice no it's like I'm doing in
Australia in like six months I'm gonna
be so so weird to be like driving in
Australian for me the weirdest thing is
kilometres now alright now I'm going to
do commoner like that so callous but
it's really not I'm just leave the miles
now but we're gonna go get stuff mom's
gonna get herself some nice Jews as well
yes trips nothing gals down mom and I
have found like a hanging chest if we're
going to get
so cool and yellow
we are finally finally leaving deed is
done we finally found a dress it only
took four hours we found it it's now
6:40 and look at that it has not moved
my lipsticks come off that's because
it's not cover FX at lunch I passed her
actually was drinking water was so tired
I pretty much just like threw it all
over my face so all my upper lip my nose
got wet but how's the motion I'm very
very impressed I've had it on since 9:30
ten nine eight nine six that is nine
hours
I can't him out I can't do much nine
hours and it still looks fantastic
I actually met so many of you today I
chose to which is lovely I don't tend to
meet people too often in England so to
feel like I had so many of you guys
there was really really nice moment joy
at 2:18 p.m. everyone was really really
kind really lovely we're now heading
back and then gonna have a cup of tea we
are don't worry
actually went to teacher and got heaps
of tea stuff so you have to try my tea
it's really nice there's like a vanilla
green tea and it's bomb it's really good
so we're gonna drive to money to pitch
that's tonight and I'm trying so hard
not to have a nap because it's going to
ruin the lake the first impression of
the foundation so I'll power through few
guys but considering our jet-lagged I am
and everything it's looking good what
was that good evening guys
it is 9:00 p.m. I have survived I'm
still awake just my eyes are absolutely
like oh so I have not touched my face in
any way in about 12 hours since I filmed
this morning applying the makeup and
just as I with any finishing ever I tend
to like rub my nose and there's like a
small spot we just come off but come
about the fact that I've had this on for
12 hours how like how this has happened
and when I met so many of you guys today
at Chad's dinner I had a lot of people
compliment my skin a lot of people like
those skin is flawless and I love your
skin what foundation are you using and
it was just like whoa hoping people tell
you in real life like that your skin
looks amazing it's like the best
compliment ever and I can quite honestly
keep this foundation a ten out of ten I
can't fault it I literally can't fault
it the finish was amazing it lasted so
long / the day I could easily wear all
the way through the night if I was going
out tonight and it wouldn't budge and
it's just insane it is lasted so long
and through me being sweaty
lu-shi pouring water on my face lunch
and trying on different dresses all day
somehow somehow this foundation has
saved me so I'm defeated I'm so ready to
go to sleep right now I'm gonna take up
my makeup give myself a little bit of a
skincare routine and then head off to
bed because this girl is so tired so
thank you guys so much for watching this
video I will check in with you sososo
say and I'll chat to you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
