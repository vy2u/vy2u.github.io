talk about a few things address a few
things that I've seen floating around on
the internet which is quite unfortunate
and they make me feel a bit uneasy and a
bit upset so it is undeniable that my
own YouTube likes being a little bit up
and down with drama and hate and
negativity and it is unfortunate and I
hold my hands up to everything bad that
I've ever done because I'm not an angel
I hope there are certain things that I
say about me which make me feel very
upset because they're really untrue and
I just want to address that in
particular just that you can kind of get
my perspective about certain things so
unfortunately when I've been looking at
a few youtubers videos recently
especially in Australian Beauty
community I've seen lots of comments but
myself on their videos I was watching
them when I scroll down to see the
comments and I was just so surprised to
see so many of helped me I was like oh
my goodness I think the thing that gets
me quite upset is so many of these
comments accusations but there's no
proof things like Danny's fake Danny's a
bully Danny's an animal abuser but
there's never the proof there and I just
kind of want to talk about that because
it does make me quiet disheartened
there's one comment that I saw on I
think it was on Bella's video it was her
youtubers I hate video and there was a
big thread about me on there and this is
specifically who I wanted to address
so it's had no excuse to be a toxic
lying Ibiza she was one of the cool
girls at school a model a party girl
firstly I just don't understand this
comment because I was not cool at all at
school I was bullied at school I
actually spent my lunch times in the art
room painting I don't know if you want
to even ask my teachers that to confirm
I don't know how you want to confirm
that I was never cool I tried to be cool
once and fit into the core group but
they could see right through it but it
was not a good time for me school I
think that's why it kind of annoys me so
much because it's just so far from the
truth I actually would sit and paint and
then we used to have like artworks on
the wall with teachers would like love
your artwork they put it on the wall and
the hallways and it was absolutely
heartbreaking it was getting really bad
with bullying and there was one time
like I went to the bathrooms and I
opened the toilet door and one of my
artworks was in the toilet and ripped up
all my other artworks which took me a
month that was like my escape was just
doing art and it was just I couldn't
even do that without it being destroyed
because it was just so bad how bad the
bullying got and so much happened in
terms of like physical abuse and how
messed up being bullied has made me now
and how I'm very paranoid these days and
always think that everyone dislikes me
because of what I went through and I
don't feel like I need to justify that I
was bullied I think me just saying it
should be enough because I don't have to
get back into that like I can't even
talk about it with a therapist because
it's so I just don't know I just don't
wanna talk about that
it just really affects me and it has
effect it has completely affected me as
a person because I had this instant
feeling that everyone I meet dislikes me
I tend to be really bad at keeping in
touch with people because I think that
I'm annoying them
there's no way to explain that but yeah
I definitely wasn't and then it said I
was a model and a party goer I've never
been a model I do not think that I could
ever be a model that's not something I
don't want to do that didn't really go
out to parties when I was 18 and I met
my ex he had a really big social group
he like kind of invited me into a social
group and went to a lot of like 18th
birthday parties together and stuff of
his friends but I feel like that's a
very normal thing to do isn't 18 year
old so I yeah I find that weird she's
insulted and since lost all of her
friends since school they weren't famous
enough for her wouldn't help her enough
in her career
instagrams weren't as well followed
doning is only interested in what will
make him more popular this is why she
fakes the intense color of her eyes I
just don't understand where people like
make this up from it's so strange to me
I see that kind of stuff all the time
that I like I'm social climbing and
Northup but I I don't understand that I
really don't like even if you want to
look into all my best closest friends
from youtuber small channels if I wanted
to I could go and climb the ladders of
so many big youtubers but that's not me
I don't want to do that and once I hit a
million subscribers that was it for me
that was my biggest goal so anything
past that for me is like incredible but
I don't like anything sorry any
subscriber that comes after a million is
just a blessing because that was my
ultimate so to say that my friends
weren't famous enough for me is just
rubbish I don't even want to say myself
on that why she fakes the interns
collaborize I don't do that and I'm
using this camera specifically today so
that you can't see anything edited or
skewed or anything my eyes are blue my
mum's eyes are blue but my dad sighs I
blew my brother's eyes blue and you've
seen me and my mum film a video together
and you've seen that we have the same
colour eyes as well so I will probably
face you in detail on my eyes but that's
about it
Danny is only interested in what will
make him more popular this is why she
fakes the intense color of our eyes I
didn't know that by having blue eyes it
made you instantly popular we
photoshopped herself to her house and
window friends and doors have been I
definitely did used to but I have cut
back and
it's actually really hard to kind of cut
back when you have so insecure but I did
used to do it so much more lived in
Australia and it was more because I felt
like I had to kind of fit in with these
standards of what other girls and
Instagram look like and I felt like I
didn't look like that I've been body
shamed so many times that I have even
more issue so my buddy know them before
YouTube and it's the same people body
shaming me who didn't also say why is
she like everything of photos it's like
well because of you because you were
making me so insecure about my body and
I just wish that more people were just
spread kindness and not be so nasty
online because there's no benefit to it
I mean they might feel bad about
themselves for a few seconds but then
why do it I don't really understand why
you have to make someone feel so bad
about themselves but I do also snapchat
and Instagram stories my outfit so you
can see that's not edited so yeah I've
definitely cut back since I moved to
England but I mean I can appreciate that
comment but at the same time I think a
lot of people don't realize it's such a
common thing in this industry like so
many people Eve on Instagram that photos
been face tuned and it is something
which is my own issue it's my own
insecurities so it's something I'm
working on I promise she moderates a
comment so insanely in books everyone
who speaks up because anyway for her to
maintain her fake reality she is a mean
girl and I feel no sympathy for lying
bullies so I don't actually monitor my
comments too much as a thing on YouTube
called helpful review and I have a few
keywords in there like fake bitch did it
about so that all gets like through the
filter and doesn't get posted I want to
have a positive space on YouTube so I
don't want there to be any comments
which could be caused into like a big
fight in my comment section so anything
that I think is a little bit
controversial or whatever I will just
remove before someone like either
defends me and attacks them back or
anything like I just want to have a
positive side of the Internet so that's
why I do moderate my comments I don't
know why I'd want to see hey by myself
like I'm gonna block it it's just how I
deal with that I just get rid of it and
then block the person who said it
because I just don't want to waste my
energy reading that stuff
if it's criticism I mean I'm all for it
but if it's you know body shaming me
taking photos of me in other people's
blogs putting it online talking about
how fat I am how disgusting I am how
ugly I am how bad my face looks from
different angles zooming in on my face
looking at all my pimples and way
imperfections
that's not criticism that's just
straight-up nastiness and that is
bullying it's really horrible harassment
to have to see about myself all the
times it's nasty and it is just
ridiculous and I understand completely
why people do it it's to make themselves
feel better about themselves like look
at how she's so imperfect she's so fake
she's so this you say that this makes me
feel better about myself it's just like
it's exhausting when I just feel the
people that have to pick people apart to
make themselves feel better it is such
an exhausting thing to do and I just
hope that one day they can find
happiness by doing something else
because is a really lonely and sad thing
to have to do to have to help people
you've never met on the Internet and I
do feel really sorry for them and I hope
that they get the help they need and I
hope that they can talk to a friend or
something about certain things without
having to create anonymous accounts
online and spread hate around because it
is just unnecessary and it is just nasty
I think one of the comments on Chloe's
video as well this thing that's been
thrown around about me being a bully
I'd love to address that because I don't
understand where that's come from and it
makes me feel very upset that people
could ever think about me in that way
because it's just so far from Who I am
and what I believe in I'm so against
bullying and in the past I've made some
stupid mistakes and I can wholeheartedly
say that in my past I've been a really
nasty person myself but I've learned
from being that way to not be that way
now I tend to be very passive-aggressive
it's just my personality it's the way my
mom is as well like we just are quite
passive-aggressive and I'm working on
that as well I am completely conscious
of my flaws in my personality and I am
working everyday to get over them and
I'm so much better than I was a year ago
and I hope that you can just understand
that I'm growing myself so when I see
bully it makes me feel very upset
because I can't think of a
single thing that I've ever done to in
like intentionally harass someone all of
you think of mostly is that if I ever
get a hate comment and I screenshot it
and put it on Twitter people say that's
bullying because I have shown the
person's name or username but the thing
is it's on a public platform anyway so I
just don't understand that but I've
learned from that from people saying you
shouldn't screenshot people's comments
on your video so now if I ever you know
have to show comments on once and I will
blur at their name and I will blur at
that photo I've learned that from people
telling me not to do that I can't
understand this thing about bullying and
people saying I'll bully my young fans
it makes this help set to think that
anyone could ever think that because it
is just so so not me so who not me like
like so annoyed that I just can't find
the right way to explain alright when I
think about it
all I can think about was that one
instance which I've already addressed
when those two girls follow me around
who are quite young in a shopping centre
and at the time I was just in a really
bad place I got really anxious really
panicky and I don't want to get into
that they commented on one of my photos
to say sorry and I specifically deleted
their comments that people wouldn't
harass them yeah I just think I'm to
interviewing without it just things
skewed so badly but I've already talked
about that in a video I did like a year
literally you going to them the last
year and it's still you know popping
around that really annoys me and there's
lots of tumblr account instruments
websites which are dedicated purely and
solely to hating me and spreading these
things around about me and I can
appreciate it when I've actually done
something or tweeted something and it is
like the wrong thing and then they talk
about how that is the wrong thing I can
appreciate that because it's proof
behind it but I think what gets me
really frustrated is the amount of stuff
which doesn't have any proof but it's
just name-calling I just see so often
fake manipulating ladder climbing dog
Ibiza all this kind of stuff and it's
just like I'm not gonna sit here and be
like I'm a victim
thing is why I'm quite protective and
defensive right now is because I don't
see anything about something else
pacifically done so if someone were to
comment and say Danny you did this it
made me feel very unhappy fair enough
but I think because there's no action
that's why it can sound like I'm being a
victim because all I'm defending is
words that are being used against me
which I don't believe in and I don't
think are about me because I don't make
any sense and they don't actually
correspond to my behavior and Who I am
as a person so then I do get defensive
but I can quite openly discuss with
someone if they are quite unhappy about
something that I've done I think as well
the biggest thing flooding around still
is I neglect my dog and I abused my dog
and it could not be further from the
truth I travel for work I have to travel
for work so an opportunity so in October
I was asked to go to San Francisco for a
Pixar trip and I wanted to go obviously
because it's an amazing opportunity and
whilst being there obviously for things
like my auntie lives in Yorkshire and
it's about a five hour train ride there
five hour train ride back because it's
literally the other side of England and
my auntie has three dogs they have all
these fields around them where dogs play
with each other all day they where each
other out beans gets like four walks a
day
she has the best time ever with my
auntie my auntie adores her it's just a
really happy safe place for her to be so
if I get a work opportunity overseas and
beans cuz I'm always going on our own
holiday and be playing with dogs all day
and having the best time it just makes
sense I'm not gonna pass an opportunity
just so I can stay at home and look
after the dog when there is that option
of her going to Yorkshire and having a
really good time there's also a service
which I came across when I first moved
here because there were some days that I
was working and I couldn't walk beans at
the same time like right now I can't
walk because I'm filming obviously I
can't do two things at once there's a
service called boring my doggy that
everyone suggested to me it's a service
we're in your area people that love dogs
but can't happen themselves will happen
like walk your dog view or whatever and
I've had like 70% up with this website I
was just gonna get like a few dog
walkers for when I'm working so that
means get some exercise and stuff when I
can't actually get at the house and
exercising myself because work and I
never used to service and it was
obviously found on my gossip websites
and stuff and there was Twitter accounts
made for like saving beans and all the
stuff this is what I find hard as that
people just don't see that I have good
intentions with her I do walk her in the
mornings every single morning but I just
thought like a second walk especially
further bring around other dogs would be
really healthy for her it's just a shame
that people can skew that in such a bad
way but I never even used the service
once and I don't know if you want to
check that in any way but I've never
ever ever asked anyone to keep overnight
a walker because it didn't make me feel
quite uncomfortable knowing that
strangers would be around my daughter
because I adore her and I'm just a bit
worried not knowing people and you know
being around her and stuff I am instead
going to go for a guy who is a
registered dog walker like in a pack
they take them to a big massive field up
north of Brighton for like an hour and
there's like
pack of dogs moves run around and play
with each other and I'm gonna set up
that service for her like every single
weekday and so that she gets out and
she's social and everything and I think
that's a really good thing I think
that's very healthy for her to get some
exercise and to socialize and I don't
think that's neglect
I think neglect is by me filming and
then not walking her all day because
I've been busy filming that's actually
trying to put what her needs are first
for when I go away because I can't just
not live my life because I have to stay
home and look after the dog when there's
someone else who's more unhappy to look
after and where I'm away I adore her and
you guys know that and it just sucks
that I have to snow off and defend the
fact that I adore my dog and even a few
months ago I chose not to show as much
as snapchat and everything because
people were just like just saying that I
was an abuser and I was this and I was
that and it would just it broke my heart
because I thought no one no one sees my
life no one sees how much I love her no
one sees how much like I just spend so
much of my day with her I walk in every
single day without fail I just I play
with her all the time and we cuddle all
the time like she is part of me and
she's always with me she's right here
you can see it she's right here as I'm
filming that she's always my little
shadow and she's the best thing that's
happened to me and it just sucks so bad
that so many people want her to be taken
away from me when I only have good
intentions for her and I learnt lots of
things through you know I don't keep her
in her own room anymore I've addressed
that a year ago and it has stuck around
like a bad smell I wouldn't have paid
three-and-a-half thousand dollars for
her to go from Australia to England if I
didn't hear about her but that's the
thing I there's no way that I can just
explain enough about how much I love her
and how wrong and nursey these comments
can be and how skewed they are and I
think the final thing to address is
other youtubers something I've always
been very open about and I am very open
if you want to ask me a direct question
you can ask me on Twitter and I'm more
than happy to respond to you but not if
it's hateful if it's a genuine question
I will chat to you and I think a lot of
people really enjoy the YouTube drama
these days and someone saw unfollowed so
and so so there must be massive drama
and people get really enticed in it
and I so missed the days of YouTube
where it was just like a camera in your
bedroom and it wasn't about drama it was
about tags in collabs and everything and
yeah yeah I think it's what are
youtubers again I don't hate any other
youtubers or anything like that I really
really love this new UK community that
I've discovered in you know in the
beauty world they're so lovely and
friendly and I really really really like
the girls and he and I really got on
with them very well but I think because
from being bullied and all that kind of
stuff that's happened in my life I just
like I said I shouldn't people don't
like me and maybe it's something I need
to work on to keep in touch with people
a lot better than I do because I tend to
just get anxious and freaked out about
texting people to make plans and stuff I
just I don't know I just don't feel like
talking about this anymore I'm just
really sad seeing the way that people
can talk about me online when they don't
know me they haven't met me and they
just don't know the full picture and it
just it breaks my heart seeing that the
some people can believe that I'm a
certain way as well when I'm really not
and I've read these comments sometimes
and I just think that's not about me
like I don't know who you're talking
about because it just doesn't make sense
so many of you are wonderful fabulous
people who are so lovely and understand
where I'm coming from but for the 1%
that unfortunately can't see my
perspective on these things I hope this
helps for you to understand where
certain things within myself come from
and why I have certain issues for
certain things but I just I hope you
know this platform can just start to
become more of a positive place it's
just really really sad the way that it's
you know turning out and I will get back
to making some fun you know routine
videos and Christmas videos things I
actually want to do and hopefully you
know we can put this to rest and if you
need to know anything feel
Rita asked me but yeah I'm not going to
talk about any youtubers anything for
that privacy I'm not gonna get into any
tea or anything like that for their
privacy and I also think it's
inappropriate so that's pretty much it
and I'll talk to you guys very soon
thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
