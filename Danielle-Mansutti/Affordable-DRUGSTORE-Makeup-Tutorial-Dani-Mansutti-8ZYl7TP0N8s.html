welcome back to my channel in today's
video it's very exciting because I used
only drugstore makeup well two things
going
I only drugstore makeup to create this
very like bronzy glowy summery look with
hater Browns and I absolutely loved it I
loved that I sprayed this look I know my
drugstore products as well I feel like
old school down here again and just
before we jump straight into it if you
like my shirt you can get it on daily
beauty calm it is the infinite black put
it back on the rack show which is my
life and I will link it in the
description below if you'd like to go
and get one for yourselves and if you're
not already subscribed I'm going to do
is hit that subscribe button and turn on
beat notifications and that's about five
the things you have to do anyway let's
get straight into it hey guys so I am
changing my setup once again so in the
previous video which I will leave up
there if you haven't seen that already I
did film in the mirror this is the
biggest farthest away I can get my
camera looking in the mirror with this
setup I can't have the camera obviously
like right in front of my face because
and I can't fit in there so we will
figure out the setup together
personally I really liked the other
setup that I had in the first impression
to you I really like that set up
whatever you didn't like it so I studied
your feedback before I start but let's
get into the structural tutorial I'm
actually using all drugstore brushes
today as well which is a first for me
but firstly we're going to start with
foundation and I'm going to be using
this Maybelline fit me a matte and
poreless foundation this one is in the
shade 3 1 0 going to feel really weird
not using with youth under but I'm using
like a whole bunch of NYX brushes today
because I recently got my hands on this
and this moon eye
I'm not going to private status because
I personally haven't found a good
drugstore primer and I wouldn't want to
just use any drugstore primer
so sake of the video when I don't
actually think it's good and that makes
them he said I love this foundation you
know you always forget how much you love
a foundation until you actually use it
again you're like oh yeah and this brush
is honestly working so well it's so soft
I've actually not used Nick's brushes
before yesterday massive Nick's all for
my own so I'm so excited to use like a
whole bunch of next product today
actually so excited because in Australia
they're actually quite hard to get your
hands on I mean it's easier nowadays I
do think that happened in Paris by now
but that's like a year ago I wish you
were like nowhere to be found so it's
like so hard Foundation is on I love
this foundation if you do have dry skin
and of course use the jus erosion I use
the matte and poreless version I have
normal skin so I can kind of go either
way but this is just my Holy Grail dr.
foundation it is so good so let's move
on to one else for my eyebrows today I'm
going to use a sleek brow kit which is
in dark eight one eight and I'm going to
use the powder more than the kind of gel
thing because going to use a little tiny
brush and it comes with as well just to
make it a little bit easier
you
so we are going to do the eyes pretty
early on in this because I really want
to do the pigment I just feel like if
there is a pigment over set makeup it's
going to go everywhere so just to get
started I am going to quickly set my
eyes using the maybelline superstay at
24 matte finish powder which is
waterproof and this one is in the shade
said so I'm putting that quickly
/ - that's just so that we don't have
any creasing or anything like that I am
very very very excited to film this eye
portion because the palette and a
pigment that I'm using so it is so the
part that we're going to be using is
this NYX perfect filter golden hour eyes
shadow palette I think is absolutely
ridiculous like it's so pretty so pretty
so I'm feeling like kind of bronzy
golden summary eye because it is a nice
sunny day stay in England well whoever
thought so I kind of did something got
in and summery and then the pigment is
all my god it is to die for
look at this wrong the orange pigment so
nice so this is a Shanghai Sun which is
by NYX and I'm so excited to make a look
with these two today we are going to
start with a transition shade I'm going
to go ahead with this brown shade here
I'm going to use this with this next
blending brush on a wallet super dry on
my crease
so it is quite shimmery I will just take
the Miss Brown in the palette here which
is more of a matte shade and I'll just
quickly go over that part again I'm
going to wet my brush I'm going to use
this NYX brush and we're going to
literally just slap it on a loop you
ready you ready here we go
oh so pretty
yeah oh my god oh good I was going ahead
with that Brown from before and just use
it to blend the pigment into the
transition so it goes look like a really
nice bronzy look I'm just going to put
the pigment on the other eye it
literally makes me so happy seeing it
applied and just like it's so dyes
I love pigments so much seriously the
drugstore price difference in England to
Australia is just madness I just
understand why I do understand why jokes
will make over so expensive it's just
for the import tax is still when
high-end makeup is the same price as
drugstore makeup in Australia and one's
going to adjust your makeup so they need
to talking about that they need to fix
it
it's just it's weird it's weird not fair
as well
hello mascara I'm going to see a L'Oreal
telescopic this is probably the most
popular drugstore mascara on YouTube
isn't it Oh
everything that I'm using is just over
it I might take a shot every time
Irsay's there's like I hate when like
ones a toothache and you just literally
can't see anything with this one okay so
all those little bad boys but now for my
lashes I'm going to use to be either
eyelashes in smitten I haven't won this
pair I think it's like the third time
that I've worn this
they are in such good condition too
delightful and just use them anyway so
I'm going to use smitten looks nice and
natural and beautiful and it still makes
such a huge difference your eye as well
here we go
so as you can see the lashes are now on
they're just super natural like eyelash
legend who don't look like ridiculously
false lashes so so the reason why I use
smitten eyes eyelashes today is because
they are actually cheaper than a lot of
drugstore lashes are considering these
are about four pounds five US dollars
six trillion dollars - very affordable
and I'll make all the details for these
lashes in my description so now to clean
up the eyes and everything I'm going to
use the fit me concealer by Maybelline
this one's a shade although it does not
have a shade out 20 I'm going to use
this - you clean up my under eyes in
case there's any excess or fallout of
anything like that and I'm going to use
the same brush that we used for our
foundation as well
around TARDIS
you're the one dropping my car
just counting away
and now taking the powder that leaves
before to sit on I'm going to use this
over my full face and I'm going to use
another NYX brush as a hard brush that
is so soft so good because he's been
just like constantly like the background
so I'm so sorry if you can hear her
snoring or anything she was quite a big
walk before this issue while we're on
the topic of dogs I'd also love to know
and love to ask you to pause this video
and write in the comments what kind of
dog you have if you have a dog or even
if you have a different kind of pet what
kind of pet you have because I'd love to
know like what's the most popular breed
or animal that we all have because I'm
such a dog crazy woman look I would love
to find that stuff out before abroad to
say I'm going to use this Rimmel Watson
shimmer bronzer in medium matte and I'm
going to use this kind of contour brush
with it my cheeks and I was wondering it
would be really cool to find that
actually how many of you guys are like
oh geez to this channel who has been
here long enough to remember when I was
like exclusively like just to only and I
was like my dream on Days to own MAC
lipstick I was like I will never be able
to afford one name yeah
like it's just seriously so mad to me
that some of you have been asked to use
now and watch my videos for years that
blows my mind I'm like whoa that it
makes me kind of like emotional little
my god I love you guys it's ridiculous I
quickly just do my nose as well but yeah
I was thinking about it today I was like
I really watched your drugstore because
it has been like so long since I have
done one but made me feel a little bit
like young Danny kind of me here
okay now this one I'm very excited for
because we're going to liquid highlight
which I might never ever ever use and
I'm very excited and kind of really
scared because I forget that I'm going
to ruin this and make it like really
good short Alexis Park is recognize that
it is the NYX
away.we glow liquid highlighter
it's like a really nice bronzy color so
wish me luck I just hope this works oh I
think I just dab it on my skin like that
and then he just says dab it in the
engines like snoring so how'd it go
right now I'm trying with a guy that I
highlight with some sleep highlighters
just to sort of amplified a bit more
because this is like a very bronzy sunny
kind of look I want to make it like very
glowy as well so I'll use this highlight
here just go ahead and blend it in okay
perfect
so the highlight is now on we are now
blowing hell yeah exactly what I wanted
I'm just going to put a little bit of a
highlight the sleek one just on my inner
corners as well okay now for the under
eyes so that brown shade that we were
using before this one here I'm going to
put that on my under eyes and I'm going
to use this little NYX pencil brush to
do that
and then Linda asked this like a really
harsh luck or anything like that because
that would look weird
now it is lips time and I'm going to use
this NYX lingerie cashmere silk lipstick
I do think it may be a little bit too
cool to and so I might actually mix it
with this highlight from before I
checked on the back you can say anything
about not being able to use envelope so
I just house it'll work still want my
looks way too cool toned and I
fortunately I don't have any drugstore
lipsticks that are like super glowy in
one but we'll put this on and then we'll
see if we need for the highlight over
the top
but you'll always be cool so we'll see
how this works I am going to apply a
little bit that highlight of the top
just to make it a little bit bronze eeeh
this is giving it like a really subtle
nice shine just really actually like
that so yeah hopefully it is a battle if
this anywhere would live so and I'm
taking this chichi liner remember to
your we're going in it center fold and
I'm going to outline my lips so I want
to say a massive thank you for watching
this video today I had so much fun at
something as a tour of you and I really
hope that you guys enjoyed it as well

then please tag me on Instagram I would
love to see it and like it and give you
love and it's actually so happy when I
see you as a great and stuff so until
