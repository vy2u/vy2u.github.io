channel I thought today I was still a
whole video because I've been buying
what sort of things in England because I
can't resist when I come here
I can't resist the food I can't resist
the clothes I can't resist fragrances
the candles like it's so much more
affordable than in Australia and it's so
much better that I just go like all that
and I'm sitting in front of a yellow
lamp if I look fluorescent orange I
apologize man today's whole video I have
things from Primark new look debenhams
River Island lots of clothes a lot of
fragrances candles perfumes gem alone oh
my god a lobster and I think that I
should get into it I'm also going to try
the clothes and show you the clothes as
well
so you can see 100% what they look like
and everything like that and without
further ado let's go and do it ok so
basically let's talk Primark everyone
knows I love myself a bit of prime Arne
I mean oh my goodness if you don't know
Primark yes essentially it's like heaven
there are so many basics and cool
clothes and stuff and they're so
affordable it's insane for example this
pinky cost me like 7 pounds or something
and it's so comfy it's so soft as well I
get just so next I picked another
pudding which is a slightly different
shade of pink I was there I was like oh
I can see some like in easy vibes here
and I like the moment like all the rich
things are really in which you know like
my great-grandma would faint at the
sight of that Noah it's cheap and I'm
going to get it from slightly different
colour than the other pink hoodie but I
think it's really cute it's really long
as well but it doesn't have like an
front pocket or anything which is a bit
like and then saw that Primark are doing
a bit of activewear now which I was like
what oh my god that's amazing we could
activate like the most expensive thing
ever and it's like a portable active and
I was like hell yeah so I picked up this
black long-sleeved top it feels like
really good quality which is amazing and
I actually honestly think I would wear
this out just as like a long sleep up
anyway because like my perfect hope it's
a long sleeve and it's high next I'm
like
you guys know I love my basics of course
I had to pick up a basic black tea in a
central superstein this the light way it
would look so nice to like denim shorts
it's quite long and the best thing is
that the sleeves are long thank God it
is like a nightmare as a girl trying to
find Topsail and cut off the shoulder oh
my oh and then also in like the active
work section I saw they had a similar
talk to the other one but in gray so of
course I had to go ahead and pick that
up and they also had matching bottoms as
well business with five pounds active Oh
bottom and we just appreciate that right
next I have a bunch of things to show
you from Rua yeah River Island like me
look over Island it River Island which
is literally like one the best shops
something that I love River Island the
first top that I got was this black top
which is high neck the sleeves are like
sort of like a see-through mesh fabric
and the top is like power inscribes I
kind of a more fake materials and it was
in like the kind of smart businesswoman
section or what okay I'm going to
pretend but I'm just hot for this moment
I really like it I just think it's so
effective it's so simple I think just
like the kind of tops
I love like I just feel like they're
classic they're timeless and they're
beautiful and they're so easy to wear
and like match the other things and a
lot stuff like they're just beautiful
beautiful tops does work oh yeah
okay next I love this top I did get
another colors all you'll see the other
color minute I absolutely love this top
so it really sucks you in at the waist
it has an inbuilt belt on it I was like
oh cool like I looked at it I was like I
need that every single color I can buy
and I saw this coat and I just couldn't
resist because it honestly just looked
so beautiful and so stunning I would
have to move wear this with like a white
thing little something there like
something very light because I know that
I matched it with the black t-shirt and
I didn't really go together very well so
I know in the future that I will match
this quote more so with filling light
and bright so as I promised I did get
the top in the other color as well and
you can see the whole belting a lot
clearer on this top and it's all
McCallum yes with it and it looks so
good with like a sick joke or something
like a thick black lacy choker would
look amazing and then finally I got this
top which actually in the right light
this actually goes kind of like hollow
holographic that would like that kind of
fancy rainbow
constanzo's looking effect but it's we
need a guy doesn't like certain types of
light but I got this t-shirt because you
know it's really cool messy slim stuff
is really cool extra wear t-shirts of
like oh yeah so I had to make the trip
to Joe Maloney whilst I was here because
the thing is my mom my high life is
always been like in love and obsessive
Geminoid so it kind of got pasta really
reminds me of like my mum's and and
everything and I just genuinely loved it
and I walked into the gym alone in Leeds
yesterday when I was with my aunty and
we which is sniffs the whole store
together found one that I really loved
which is this one it was the English
pear and freesia freesia sweet freesia
basically in Australia teas are so
expensive that it was really worthwhile
to get the big size because of the
smaller size like it wasn't worth the
price the big size I said like so much
money compared to what it would have
paid it back home this smells like so
fresh and floral and like spring to me
it smells like
oh my god I wish you could smell this
like I wish that you could smell what
this is like so I picked this up I
sprayed it on I was like wow I love that
smell like I've never smelled anything
like this in my life and then I picked
up little Casper in it so that it works
really well with another sense means
probably a marketing thing but you know
to make you buy more but it works for me
I try the other side
I was like actually I really like this
scent as well so I mix them together
this one is me I believe it's the to
give arose and jelica I believe and oh
my god
it is incredible I'm pretty sure this is
one of the new ones and it's just like
the most amazing thing ever when you mix
these two like honestly it is just the
most heavenly smell ever
like I can't if it makes me genuinely
happy how is that like it smell makes me
genuinely happy but I swear to God
smelling this right now I think it's
because there's so much Association I
have it I can just imagine my family my
mom like these kind of sense but it's
not so good I love the bottle so much
they like the perfect things to put like
on your dressing table this is so
gorgeous and oh my god if you are
anywhere near jo Malone
please smell these two and please tell
me what you think because oh good okay
now I am like in love with this clothes
I walked past a lift to London store
which I've never been in before and I
saw it like on the style rack and I was
like that's what I want because when I
came to England I was like I really want
like a black coat like time laughs maybe
a little bit of white or just pull back
and I saw this and it sounds like
40-something pounds and I was like give
it to me now oh my god I tried it on I
absolutely loved it this coat
I love it so much I'm actually stowing
away my old coat is so bad it was like a
Ken doll my micro for like five years
ago and I finally have it upgrade I
can't believe that this cost me like 40
I love it so much I'm so happy that I
found it yeah this is like you know when
you set out to buy something this is
exactly what I had mine and for such a
cheap price of like hey continuing
almost cents
huh oh okay sirens gone hello continuing
over cents what else it's Holly's house
I noticed all around a house which
smells amazing like a house which is
incredible singing what is that smell
and like every single ring my heavy big
fat candles and they were old Yankee
Candles and now in Australia I've
personally never seen them anywhere
never seen them at anyone's house in
Australia we have a lot of like oh my
god I forgot the name you know the big
orange one that is like the vanilla oh
my god the glasshouse we have vast as
ever oh my god I can't live off the
government and to be a weed over there
Yankee Candles we've just got a bath and
Bodyworks opened up but like it what
expensive compared to American optimize
even worth it so I went into Devlin's
today on a hunt for some Yankee Candles
now you know whatever disaster let's put
it that way because um I found a candle
which I love like I loved I believe it's
like a honey and oak one or something
like that
it was the last one there so I was like
alright I'll grab that one and then I
was like you know I might as well look
around for something else I picked this
one up and relax it as well which I'll
get into in a second and what was I
doing I was like look just witch's
picking things up and smelling them and
I was holding on my head and I was
holding it kind of like like this I
think and then like my finger just like
split and in the candle
only about this one sister hit the floor
and it smashed
everywhere like everywhere the candle
smashed
everywhere and it made the biggest noise
and M&amp;amp;Ms and I had every single course
in the world today I mean I was like it
was like the most embarrassing thing
ever and it's because and you guys will
notice if you followed me for a long
time you will know that every single
time that I've ever liked showing a
product up to the camera what happens
like nearly every single time my hand
shake because I'm a little nervous wreck
sometimes I was like this for some
reason I just get like that sometimes
was just feeling living really tiny I
have a bit of it like I don't notice
that I do it but you know like no matter
what I hold up to you like my hands are
always like I don't want to think about
it and I'll do it more but they you know
I can never hold things still and like
even when I do love this everyone's like
it's so shake again I'm sort of my hands
on which you like all the time um yeah
just me my dad oh yes I was so
embarrassed and kind of annoyed because
it was the last one in that scent and I
ruined it and then I was like oh my
goodness I'm so sorry I found like the
nearest last number I like offered pay
for it offered to pay offered to clean
it myself I was so embarrassed like but
anyway that was my experience today
buying Yankee Candles and M&amp;amp;Ms but I
know now to always hold it like this I
think what I really like about Yankee
Candles that they have that kind of very
sweet
punchy sense like the Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
one sounds like like strawberry ice
cream at like 30 cents like it's a bit
like very preachy really nice actually
and then when I was out and about I knew
that I had to buy some morphic turns so
lovely in England they stock the rim all
asunciÃ³n our self-tan this isn't
sponsored on some genuinely love is
product I go on about this all the time
but not wanted to talk about this I
literally went into they boots or safe
drug and I was like a new tent and you
can because that's where I get a leg
because I'm so white and you'll see like
in my product shock that product shot
I'm really white at the moment
yeah I was like the mini cannot fall on
time I go to Brighton description so
pick us up because I love this bad boy
it works so well for me I got the dark
matte mousse as well I was actually
quite shocked at how expensive fake tan
is in England I was a bit like whoa we
paid we get to pay less for in Australia
and while that is but the o'the amount
of seeing which like England paint more
for so the really okay
but this was really affordable this is
like under 10 pounds I think but like
for other brands like Central Asia which
is like 30 pounds look the big has some
gorgeous appear I might put it on my
back for me for that price or singing
like whoa I love time favorite I was
like oh that's expensive so that was my
rule santera schedule sucks mark oh my
god I am so pale right now my makeup
doesn't match my mind I'm like dang huh
and say that concludes my home home I
know I need a break
what is that are we going today my
clothing fragrance and socks haul yeah
