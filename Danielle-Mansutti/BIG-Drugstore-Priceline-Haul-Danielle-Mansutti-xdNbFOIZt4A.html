today I have a Priceline hall I have
been spending some big bucks
at Priceline lately and I thought you
guys would want to see what I bought
sorry I just want to start off by Oh
avoiding any confusion be a date today
is the 6th of May I'm heading to
Kentucky in 9 days so this is like the
last proof film video I've done so
currently there's a promotion which if
you spend over $60 in the store you get
a bag full of makeup worth over $200 and
I haven't opened it yet to avoid any
confusion yes is being uploaded in June
obviously I'm in Europe so I can't film
so this is I don't think that promotions
are any more so yeah don't want to give
you guys or anything the first thing
that I bought was a simple kind of skin
hydrating light moisturizer I've seen
this simple being used on YouTube a lot
a lot of people love simple and I really
wanted to give it a go so the bottle is
like this a very little bottle of just
opened it I'm gonna use it tonight but
it says it's kind of skin hydrating like
moisturizer it says for sensitive skin
which is awesome so it's not gonna hurt
I'm not gonna break me out or anything
like that lately I've just been
searching high and low for any
moisturizer so I'm hoping this one will
be good so if you guys use simple then
please let me know if it broke you out
broke you out is that the right term did
it break you that you think I'm supposed
to say or if it's a really good
moisturizer all that kind of stuff
because I'd appreciate knowing that the
next thing that I bought are these
beauty essentials oval cotton pads and
the reason why I bought this is the fact
that they are so massive I use the
Garnier micellar water to remove my
makeup so summer this is amazing because
normally the cotton pads that you buy
like the tiny little round ones but
these are massive so I'm just gonna like
slap it on my face when I take off my
makeup and be like ooh
in one go let's hope you know you're a
bit pathetic when you're excited to use
cotton pads but I'm pretty excited to
use them tonight the next thing I got
with these travel Medicare bottles I'm
going to use this for when I go in
Europe they're - 75 mil travel
bottles I'm going for my shampoo and
conditioner in there not very exciting
but hey I bought it so I'm going to show
you also for traveling I have the adult
go fresh moisturizing cream in cucumber
and green tea do you hunt did you guys
know that if you have mosquito bites the
number one way to just soothe via tunas
in the pain is to use roll-on deodorant
it sounds so weird but I'm someone who
gets bitten all the time by mozzies and
I swear to God that is a lifesaver so
make sure you have roll-on deodorant if
you're prone to getting bitten because
it helps so much and this is just so
exciting but I bought some panadol Wow
the next thing that I picked up was the
Maybelline fit me foundation in the
shade 310 Sun beige now this bottle to
me seems tiny in person I don't know why
but I thought it was gonna be here it's
bigger than this I don't know do you
guys find that when you watch something
on YouTube it always looks bigger than
it is in person so I have not tried this
yet I'm gonna wear it tomorrow it says
it's a Jewish smooth Oxton whoa Achtung
Achtung oxide sunscreen yep for normal
to dry skin which is me does really say
anything else about it next I picked up
this face of Australia blush in the
shade of peachy you guys know I'm
obsessed with that one NYX blush in full
play and I hate saying that though this
seems like a very similar color to the
NYX blush that I use so really shimmery
and light pink and just very pretty so I
like it
the next item is something which I
picked up really fast because my balance
was at 42 dollars worth of makeup and I
needed $60 to get the free back things
so I just ran over and picked up the
first thing I saw which was this L'Oreal
pink nude lipstick from the outside it
kind of like velvet teddy so I was very
interested in it of course velvet teddy
is my favorite I love more brownie nudes
so hopefully this one will go with me
the next thing I picked up is this array
lipgloss now I don't ever wear look was
I really want to start doing it because
my lips always look way too dry and
gorgeous so I thought I would pick up a
lip colored Nicholas
this is 315 supernatural the packaging
is extremely boring but I'll go to go
tomorrow as well and see cut yeah the
last thing that I picked up for myself
is this big big big makeup bag it only
cost me seven dollars it's got three
little compartment things I'm gonna be
taking this with me to TP and I love the
color and the design it's so cute and
girly so that's why I think this one up
as you guys saw I got lots of like other
stuff like the tribal staff as well the
$60 thing bag thing you can only get it
if you spent $60 on like L'Oreal Rimmel
etc but I've got a lot of things which
weren't and I basically it'll cost me
like $90 I think all that was $90 and so
I got the big pink bag which I haven't
opened yet so I'm gonna open it now on
camera I got this big bag here with my
purchase size of it's valued at over
$200 so lovely bag yeah sorry we have a
glorious a little a loofah from Ecotools
this is the eco-friendly fast sponge
customer - my colors man okay next we
have an Essie nail polish
this is number 72 don't know what the
name is it just says 72 it's a very
corally pink Coralie bit like kind of
fluorescent Pink's next there is a I
don't know if it's natio or natty oh um
French nail color the thing is I didn't
buy this so I don't know what to say
about it I'm just like yep that's the
name of the Brooke
next we have the organic we're back
outta mascara it says 100% natural
origin false lash effect almost
unbelievable I've never ever tried this
brand before I'm gonna read the shape is
it in the sky okay here we have a triple
lutz shine Sally
hence
don't know I think it's a nail polish
but it's black everyone I've never seen
a car like this before and I definitely
don't own a car there's so much you're
gonna put this on right now because I
think it's awesome so that is awesome
love it let me have Anna Knox are
setting machine spf30 and natural finish
makeup in a buttermilk so it's a light
creamy textured makeup suitable for
normal to dry skin it provides flawless
long-lasting natural color and SPF 30
sunscreen for a day long protection from
the sun's damaging rain radius so is
this a foundation it's kind of weird
though if you have a bag that you give
to everyone not everyone give you
through skin color but we'll see next
there's a revlon colorburst a lack of
balm which looks like this so it's a
very pinky color obviously a lip balm
but she's so funny head down hill those
Falls gone since I've opened this bag I
don't know what to say next we have a
scandalized a rockin curves mascara by
Rimmel I do own everyone's a little
mascara which is similar to this one and
I used to love it so absolutely good I
sort of don't want to open it it's all
dried out you don't know me but I want
to see what the one looks like we have a
L'Oreal Paris base magic transforming
smoothing primer this has to be the
smallest primer that I've seen in my
entire life that is tiny this is
actually tiny we have a nude by nature
mineral lip gloss in the flirty sort of
like an orangey pink yeah
orange a pink I'd say don't really use
lip gloss but do you want to start using
more like I said before so who then we
have a savvy clear brow gel I am
actually really excited that this is in
the bag because I love brow gels
especially the clear ones I had a clear
brow gel from
from our dough and that used to be clear
and now it's brown look how gross is
that for the makeup products so kind of
like what you want to try it out instead
and finally we have a models prefer
moisture lust glossy lip tint which is
sort of like an orange each shape here
as well
so that is the whole I would like to
apologize if I've been looking in the
previous screen too much I'm not
checking myself out or anything like
that it's just that my lighting is not
working today and it's just that it's
storming out so I've been checking being
like it's the weather okay but I know
how annoying it is when you're watching
a video and the whole time they're just
like looking at the preview screen and
just looking around the room and never
looking at the lens so I want to
apologize for that because that would
annoy me a lot so I hope you guys
enjoyed this whole exciting news you're
watching this on the 16th of June which
means I arrived back in Australia in
alas hide it's the way that I'm saying
that because I haven't even left yet for
Europe once but I arrived back on the
15th at nighttime so this video my next
