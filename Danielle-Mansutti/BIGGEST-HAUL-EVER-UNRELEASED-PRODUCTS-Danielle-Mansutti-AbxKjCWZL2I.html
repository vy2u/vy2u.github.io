just got back from LA I picked up a lot
of goodies over there and I also was
gifted a lot of goodies over there as
well before I get into the video I did
daily vlog every single day in eilat and
then every single day in our leg things
like on a scent Monica going to
Universal Studios Michaels in heaps
where vlogs and blog the Too Faced event
I've looked so much shot I will leave a
little box here for you to go and check
out my blog I don't also leave on my
blog description below and also before
we jump straight into everything I also
want you guys know I'm very quickly that
I have done any date tonight makeup look
on the I love makeup channel I'll leave
all the links and all the description
down below and go and check that one out
I haven't filmed a video and so on and
literally touchdown in Melbourne a few
hours ago and I'm like I need to film
video I need I'm really excited me
filming again it's nice to be home and
let's get straight into this so the
first thing that I picked up I would
love to do a first impression review on
this is the makeup / H Street foundation
for Ultra HD foundation this is in why 3
to 5 I pretty much just took my nas
barcelona's that I picked this one so
hopefully the color matches right I got
this from Sephora and it's the only
foundation that I picked up and if you
want to see your first impression on
this please let me know I'd love to do
that there are so many to face products
in this haul because I went to a Too
Faced event it was an international
bloggers event and they were way too
generous and gave us way too many gifts
there will be a lot of two-faced in this
hall as well and the first toothpaste is
my favorite new palette from Too Faced I
love it so much and the packaging design
on the inside it's just huge variety of
colors in this palette as well I love
the blue and I love this pink it is such
a crazy king of those has a lot of
lovely mattes
shimmers a lot of warm tones and
so it's absolutely perfect and I was
using this palette so much when I was
away and I'm pretty sure this is part of
their Christmas collection continuing on
with palette I got for this bad boy I
got the Lark Pro whoops a new makeup mic
on that exactly and one of this was so
long I feel like the only YouTube that
doesn't own anything from the rack until
now how insane you know all those colors
it is so beautiful there is so much
variety in all the colors as well the
only thing which I'm a little bit like
about bestows oh what many wives I wish
they took out a few of these like light
colors and put a few more like sort of
like - this is Gogi color this goji and
tangerine or my favorites I just think
that they are so stunning you might have
seen in my blogs as well the Too Faced
event when I went out ages Part C create
a nice soft brown smokey eye as well
which a lot of you have requested and
your makeup tutor along but please let
me know if you'd still likes to love
this color year called gold leaf it is
absolutely beautiful
next is another two-faced product we
have the Too Faced natural matte palette
this is a little eyeshadow palette which
is perfect for traveling it has your
basic natural matte touch me as it says
on the box I think it could make a
really beautiful striking up sort of
mummy
very very very warm smoky eye using this
palette I'm someone that's sort of like
shy away from that's a little bit but
meeting the other youtubers it made me
realize Danny you need to like calm down
the shimmers and focus on the mats cuz
the girls wearing matte I showed it
there oh I knew that I need to learn how
to do max like why my don't take mats
okay I'm really glad that this was an
honor goodie bag as well and I
absolutely adore the packaging we have
this little sister or brother on the
side here this is the natural eyes in
the shimmering version which
but seriously just look at the honeypot
honeypot is incredible
the shivery on does have more like a
golden-brown feature within it and this
one is a lot more like a plum - the dark
purple red same going on oh my goodness
I use this this morning this is the
hangover primer by Too Faced I'm not
hungover but my skin is so dehydrated
from being on a plane or yesterday and
honestly and this is an incredible
product I use underneath my NARS sheer
glow and it just sort of like hydrated
my skin made me feel more awake and
alive and so it has coconut order
probiotic base ingredients and skin
revive is and that it's silicon free
okay guys how could I not how could I
not to get champagne pop by Jacqueline
Hill
I honestly saw this as soon as I opened
Sephora and I was like I need that part
even seeing this lighting because the
Sun is so crazy right now but I do have
it on today I love this I do find with
soft and gentle by Mac it looks kind of
money on my skin I don't really get why
does that but this one didn't this was
really shimmery really fresh and really
nice on my skin this is a another Too
Faced palette this is an absolutely
gorgeous range Browns future and a
lovely blush at the end as well this is
a perfect palette to me I absolutely
love the names in this palette because
it will French so you have like feet
feet feet Bonjour oui Mademoiselle it's
so cute I love how French inspired all
the packaging is so thanks to you guys
and your recommendations when I was in
the USA you were all like daddy me to
see Bath &amp;amp; Body Works I kept calling it
van Basten but I go ExxonMobil team-best
I'm going into that shop and just going
around the candles and just sniffing the
wall such a weird eye but oh my god that
kind of amazing they have like waffle
scented candles pumpkin scented candles
all these like really sweet different
things in Australia we just all kind of
shops know we have like lavender vanilla
I picked up this lakeside sunrise candle
because I couldn't fit a big one in my
bag because they are so heavy and I wish
you guys could smell really YouTube
screen it's such a fresh scent and I
absolutely love it do any of you guys
have likes like sunrise but the body wax
I also had a lot of suggestions from you
guys to check out Kat Von D's range so I
went over there and then everything was
sold out and I thought this is a good
sign this meeting stuff is pretty good
so I picked up this one called more
power it is such a beautiful red plummy
color and if you guys can see this like
my hand is so white right now it's just
like bouncing all over light number
those when i swatched it in Sephora i
was just like you are kidding me like
this is incredible
continuing on from the Kat Von D range I
also picked up one of her liquid
lipsticks this is fan Pieria every
single one the liquid lipsticks were
sold out except this one and a black one
I was in my last day in LA vlog when we
went to the comedy show and I loved the
fact that it stayed on for so long I
find with any liquid lipstick when you
wear it for a long time I do get that
like horrendous line stayed on through
eating drinking it is avanthika that is
the perfect way to span period it's a
dark purple but it does have that hint
of red as you can see on the outside of
my hand how it's gone a lot more of like
a lot of red it is a really really nice
color and I love bring dark lips at the
moment I don't know what it is I'm in
spring and I'm wearing fall colors I
don't know it just goes up but I love a
good talk with like a very naked eye
just a very simple eye and this is gonna
get used a lot next I have this cute
little baby this is the NARS creamy
concealer in custard this is
one I actually was just about to pay it
Sephora and I started to check out
goddamn your marketing is so good at the
checkout they have so many minis that I
try and show you for quite a price as
well and I'm like always like I need to
have it however I did find that it was
very hard to get product at all I had to
like keep dipping it in again to figure
it out and getting product more on my
face because the product wasn't coming
out as much as I would have liked it
cheer like my naked concealer does when
she look smashed republic's concealer
does so that was the only downside with
this but it did actually work out really
well it blended really wants my skin to
look muddy or anything so I was going to
keep this fit to the end but I think
I'll just show you guys anyway so you
see this lovely to face bag right here
are you ready for how insane this is oh
my god we're gonna have to get through
this really fast there aren't no words
to describe the feeling of opening all
those gifts from Too Faced and all of
that was in it I am very lucky to be
given this kind of stuff how exciting
it's so exciting right but this is the
entire melted range including ones which
haven't been released yet and you guys
are gonna see a sneak peak of quite a
feat things now so this one is called
melted rainbow and then we have melted
melon and then we have melted nude
melted metallic debutante melted sugar
this one is a baby size one it is melted
peony puny we have melted coral this one
is the metallic frozen of hot chocolate
which is not out yet so a chocolate
milkshake
we have melted frosting melted metallic
a macaron and then we have melted
Chihuahua
melted velvet melted jelly donut
melted strawberry melted metallic
Dreamhouse chocolate honey melted
marshmallow melted candy mountain violet
ultimate Alec - too melted fairy melted
fuchsia metallic candy bar melted
villain melted metallic bunny
chocolate cherries and melted chocolate
diamonds
isn't that insane it's just my boy like
how lovely they are in generous they are
the next thing I have is this glamour
super cleanse daily clearing cleanser
which is for problems in skin
imperfection support refine mattifying
and clarifying this one is more of a
cleanser version of the traditional mud
mask I've been using this quite a lot
when I was away and I did find it was
helping my pimples a lot because I don't
know about you guys when I travel I get
so many pimples and it's probably to
blame on how bad my start gets my job
opiate balanced diet that we should all
follow disappears and it's gone until
I'm back home and then I'm eating
chocolate chips
I mean burgers I mean fries all day
every day and then I'm like why you have
pimples seriously we have another cute
little to face palette and this one is
full of your Pink's these ones are all
shimmers except for this one here I
don't know about you guys when I go
makeup shopping I always go and think
what's comfortable to me like golden
shimmer is and brown matte like wow you
have so many dating do you really do
anymore this is the kind of palette
which I need to just practice more with
because I need to go in my comfort zone
and just like try new things and try new
colors and see if they like look really
good or not and then I'm just going to
quickly go into another Too Faced
palette another one with the absolutely
stunning packaging on it I love the
little Eiffel Tower in the background as
well I think my favorite tooth base
color of Alzheimer's honeypot and that
is in this palette as well and while
we're still on that topic I will quickly
show you the last two face part that I
have and this one it contains a lot more
of like your darker colors as purple as
black Ricky's a grey and then you have a
brown a pink and a white so this would
work very well with a purple smokey eye
and of course I had to check out
Anastasi Beverly Hills and I was there
and you may have noticed I stopped using
my date for a pomade the dark brown one
and the simple answer for that is that
it was just way too dark for my eyebrows
so I decided to pick out the be a soft
brown and dip brow this is a lot better
for my eyebrow color it is not as dark
and it is a lot more natural and just
suitable for my eyebrows and my hair
it is slightly lighter than my natural
hair color and I'm like can you see I
use this on the beginning of my eyebrows
and I am so using my Mac deep dark
brunette on the ends it just creates a
really cool gradient and I really like
colors to products work really well
together and my final product to share
with you guys is this baby toothpaste
bronzer so this one is in chocolate
Soleil and it's just the perfect bronzer
color and I absolutely love the Too
Faced are bringing out a lot of minis
because they're so cute and they're
super could be a handbag so that is my
entire la mole it is absolutely insane
and I'm so grateful for all the
two-faced products which I received I'm
also super excited to try all the
products that I bought as well so please
let me know if you want to see a makeup
forever first impressions video I'd love
to do that because I've heard so many
good things about the foundation I
really hope you guys enjoyed this whole
video and I really hope you don't think
this is something like a showing off
video I really don't want to come across
that way I've had a lot of people
request for me to show them what I got
at the toothpaste event and that is the
sole reason I do not want to look like
I'm bragging or being like super
stuck-up like oh my God look what I
bought in America no this is just like
if you my friend and we were sitting
together and just showing you this and
this but I do hope that you really
enjoyed this whole I love pull videos
