in the morning I've been having the
worst leap ha
I'm getting up like every 20 minutes and
the Restless good morning everyone it is
some day as the Sunday the 15th of
January I'm about to go into a little
bit of a workout that's what it would
include it in today's vlog I was binge
watching it so many bloggers yesterday
and it just like inspired me to lobster
I'm going to include my workout when I
eat I'm seeing friends for lunch today
I think I may go grocery shopping
seriously a normal Sunday and I think my
focus on legs in the boot a shit-eating
almost for thrush I'm also going to give
you a life update because I feel like we
haven't had a chat in a very long time
which makes you really sad so ah some go
to gym okay so I am now all ready to go
I am wearing Nike shoes a color release
from and this bralette top Singh is from
forever 21
I'm just using the gym that we have
upstairs in my apartment but I'm like a
hoping that there's more in there
because the gym is so small and it
really sucks I'm wondering if you know
of any good change gyms I know there's
like Anytime Fitness - Fitness first f45
on an early I really do sign up to a
proper gym the reason why I want to
change that I want to be able to use if
I go to Sydney or Queensland or wherever
so if you do know of any really good
gyms I should turn up - nonetheless know
if you could also let me know your
favorite activewear brands that would be
incredible no need to stop just buying
it from like cotton on body and so I
need to buy some actual good active wood
now I'm just going to feed beans her
breakfast and then it is all - 15 years
Oh
so now that students done it is time for
a protein shake to help repair the
muscles and all that kind of fun stuff
so I'm going to do that now so it's
going to grab my cup I just put in one
series of protein pad other kids of the
nominal sizes one and all I'm going to
add is a little bit of oil
let's go out of breath and it's going
trick just right how to do in one hand
I'm just going to blend this very
quickly
what about I'm so over this pricing data
especially over the artificial banana
flavor it's a bit like I want to try um
is it being protein or something I think
this is whey protein but I want to try
some new versions so and I said you guys
know any questions today I'm like just
starting my fitness journey that might
help me also I am completely aware that
my form may be completely wrong here
like all the exercises that I did please
don't watch that video and watch the way
that I did it and redo it because I'm
literally a child is like two weeks ago
like full one two weeks ago I honestly
recommend to invest in a personal
trainer because my sense was trying to
correct my form all the time when I do
stuff on myself obviously my form is
going to be slightly also slightly wrong
so yeah I'm a well aware that my phone
may not be correct so well I need new
flavors we've had so I'm going to take
beanie out for a walk then I see some
grocery shopping I'm going away in like
two days to LA so not a big shopper too
little want to get some bananas and
fresh fruit and all that kind of stuff
I'm going to do it further hey guys I'd
go back from taking a little miss beanie
for walk I'm about to do a very small
grocery shop because I left at the start
I'm going to LA in two days I only need
food to last me for tonight and for
tomorrow as well I just want to take you
along with the thing is I just realized
cuz of Sunday it's going to be packed I
don't even care
I mean I'm going to fly it my shyness
and vlog in the supermarket in front of
everyone because why not
so I'm a cold girl here in Australia we
are either like a cold person or a
Woolworths person personally I prefer
Kohl's don't know why I do some subset
when I get to LA I'm going to go
straight to Whole Foods and stock up on
some goodies it is winter and la is not
need to figure out what to pack because
there's a cold at I really think so X is
LA this week I've been doing a lot of
filming which will be coming up in the
next week or so with all the filling
that it have done this week I actually
because this is the third video that I
filmed this week I actually haven't done
makeup like put a full face on to any of
them which is under photo for me but I
can't wear makeup that often in real
life like this is how I look most of the
time I just have mascara on and I have a
little bit of concealer here and that's
it like my browser sell abroad normal
kind of stuff really like how I don't
feel the need to put on makeup as much
anymore like online it's really nice
really refreshing to to have the freedom
of not feeling like I have to hide
behind a mask or anything if I actually
know I'm going to put makeup on later to
see Maddie but I don't know I was like
even my skin a breakthrough you know if
you wait to the time sir
yeah oh that's your L always take your
bag the plan is
snacks or plane because on that flight
to Los Angeles hate eating plant food
I'm going to get snacks playing I'm
picking dr. goji berries I may get some
fruit and we can
he's already notice but the golden rule
when it comes to shopping is to do not
encounter something around the outside
such as fruit your veggies you're not
and still meet and do 10% in the middle
for your naughtiness and stuff like long
lasting milk protein bars and all the
best little bit of the berries I'm going
to grab some strawberries a moment grit
piece from specials and I only need one
panics I'm leaving soon anyway
so just one semester berries I do love
grapes and my favorite forever but
they've learned so much from not having
groups today these are my favorite
tomatoes in the whole entire world of
the I'm also going to grab some bananas
that are ready now because I'm going to
go today and tomorrow to eat and just
kind of go through it's a really big
packet closure hmm that's more like it I
already have some Bolly salad and stuff
a horn but normally I would get the baby
spinach one oh yeah I'm going to get a
red capsicum as well so this is not just
a little one for a little untidy
the computers largest breasts when you
like massive arms which is a white
demonic so I ate all that so I'm kind of
like so this is like one of the only
aisles accidentally little shopping
sometimes I mean Steve Marcus Chris
behind chicken breast really fine did a
dark breast Phillips going to be good
and off of these on my favorite protein
bars by the bar cancer they are so yummy
and I'm going to get some for the plane
it's cool she's like my guilty pleasure
than women I've got something plain
Naomi that's how the goji berries you
know and normally I get my milk from
here I don't think it's the unsweetened
almond milk but I have so much time that
I definitely don't need my god don't
tempt me please young now I'm currently
in the nori aisle just because I want to
have a look if there's anything slightly
healthy here my favorite young and this
is my favorite popcorn brand in the
world my favorite flavor is salt and
vinegar I mean never ever ever have it
come on called company so I'm going to
skip the math because it's naughty and I
shouldn't have this also I got this last
time I was here and I had it all in one
night
