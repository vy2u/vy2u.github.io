I have returned from jet skiing my body
feels like really salty and stuff right
now but I just came into this these are

so thank you so this was just delivered
to my room house wait for this I think
we're about to feed the Sharks ah how
exciting this is a big reason of why I
love Tarte cosmetics so much so as you
can see that kiss and makeup campaign is
about anti-bullying which we all know is
something very very very important to me
in spreading positivity so I think it's
amazing that a company is spreading such
awareness to such an amazing cause it
actually means a lot to me alright time
to try this bad boy yo I'm just sitting
here chillin
I was just on snapchat because I just
figured out I've literally traveled the
world with this headband like everywhere
it's got it everywhere with me
it's meets like 120 countries it's
insane definitely worth the 30 years I
bought it for Disneyland that's for sure
I just jumped on snapchat and did
something that I definitely would not
have done a few months ago actually
showed everyone on snapchat my bloated
belly so I don't know why I did I just
ate so much chocolate but Tarte
delivered to my room and instantly like
and I only blow underneath my
bellybutton
it's really weird like it's so weird I'm
just so sad and what does this mean that
I can't have chocolate like the worst
news of my life so quickly before I show
