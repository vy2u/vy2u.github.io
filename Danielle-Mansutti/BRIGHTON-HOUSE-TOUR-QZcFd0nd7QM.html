people at an Airbnb which is super said
of us now we packed up my stuff
I could be Tyler coming soon we just
watched back with love that you would
have always seen by now quite funny
isn't it
probably something more weird

so I have just arrived in my little
Breton hounds which I booked an ethane
baby I thought I wanted to experience
living solo for a little bit so I'm here
tonight tomorrow and I leave the day
after two nights here and I'm going to
give you a little bright house tour
right now so this is my cute little flat
for next P nights have my kitchen and
we've got our little table of beautiful
mirror and we have this TV station which
in management a little st. Matt and all
16 games little couch and then like a
little study bit my favorite bit is
outside I can show you that and this is
my little bedrooms the next two nights
too I think is so sweet smells like my
Nana's house in here I don't know how
I'd why but it smells like my Nana's
house baby here
jadon crazy and then finally on our
little toolbox I like my Nana's house I
don't understand this is a little
bathroom and shower and all the
constants best fit my favorite bit it's
outside because how cute is this
courtyard I am and go and explore now
I've absolutely no idea where I am like
I've never been to Brighton for my life
or anything like that I thought I want
to visit here because like as you
noticed how many people are live here
I'm going to check it out Mike alpha do
but if wandering and exploring alone and
on the drive to my taxi driver was so
and lovely and he was just telling me
like so much history about Brighton and
he was telling me like all the places to
go a little shops to see and stuff like
that and one key I am going meeting up
with some people not sure overboard or
not we will see sorry I need to go do
some food shopping when I get some fruit
in chicken and there's cream stuff like
that I'm really excited going up a
little wonder outside it is a bit of a
cloudy day compared to all my other days
it is a bit rainy and overcast and stuff
so hopefully I don't get rained on or
anything like that so I'm staying in
Sussex Square
how beautiful are these houses they are
some English I love it there's like
gated gardens in that is another one
back oh my god my voice
that's for my cold is killing me I think
these are so cute I love them as you can
see the sky and the sea has merged with
the sea is right there
but we're going to walk casting right
now woo I'm loving these houses
how cute are they I need to see I like
it down there this is the family the
else is there and I'm up here so I go
down this method pass English like might
be that our episode of mr. bean when you
went to like the beach yes girl for
download
that's how I feel right I'm sure look
like a more logical way to get down
I'm sure I'm in college but you know
anyway so as the chicken fruit veggies
key chocolate I'm gonna get me through
it because walk what else she's the kind
of saw in my life
love oh my god Oh environment people
again my money's missing why am i rude
amazement okay you actually no no we saw
sounds good
this is wrong I don't know what I have
to old answer very says like I often
woke up afterwards
with all my shopping I'm very confused
right now
might have gotten cool in the rain maybe
just slightly my hands are like really
cold I haven't had this feeling in like
what good is it alright just carry these
all the way back which is about a mile
two miles walk so got some cardio and
then today I'll show you what I bought
okay so he is my little food haul and
this is what I call a balanced diet so
we have some treats at the back but we
also have lots of whole foods and fresh
fruit which is good so I got some
strawberries I love in the chill breeze
or scrub to reserve their from they
honestly pish-posh better than tell
anyone sorry cherry tomatoes of course
got some minestrone cuz it's freezing
and soup sounds amazing and I've got
some tuna but the thing is I could not
find tuna in olive oil anywhere so I had
to get some flour oil gently does it
helps me is it not a normal thing to
have olive oil Trina inning let me know
on orange got some leafy salad
close the risk again for tonight so
meets my protein and I found with
granola it's a very very very impressed
with because on the back it is a
thirteen point five grams of protein per
so which is a lot of like whoa of course
have to pick out some apple cider
vinegar because YUM I have my
unsweetened almond milk and of course
and Patrice I got some snappy jacks and
lovely so much I had to get an Easter
Egg because I love English chakra so
much some mayonnaise McCoy's so my
favorite English summer crisp I love
them and yes yes so that's everything
that I got big advocate of a balanced
diet usually healthy diet healthy I
guess I'm going to heat up that chicken
I'm going to roast chicken and a lot of
salad because I need some greens
I hope the tap water is okay I have
I'm sure it will be fine and I forgot to
buy a bottle of water ah
I have food I have a microwave I so I
cannot wait another microwave oh I do it
Friday yeah I think it's free office I
don't really have the best relationship
with food at the moment like I'm going
to be completely honest completely open
about that i-17 I start training and
stuff I fall into a habit of almost like
feeling ashamed when I eat like snack
food junk food where like I feel really
ashamed and like really down and
hardened myself and I always I always
think that I look huge to myself but I
don't it's just my head like playing off
me
I should just save ourselves you should
be allowed to have traits you should be
allowed to indulge sometimes but for
some reason I get really hard on myself
and I put on weight really fast so one
of those people my metabolism is long
gone now so yeah I had like three
consecutive days of cheat day when I was
a charlie recently so I'm gonna eat some
healthy food right now but I'm working
on it like I am just going to be
completely honest with you and I do have
a bit of an issue at the moment with
food just in terms of my mind the way
that it works with food and beating
myself up about eating certain foods so
so work in progress like I said with my
fitness journey and everything and my
health and fitness journey it is
something which is gonna take a long
time before I actually find the healthy
lifestyle that I'm looking for that sort
of works that works into my lifestyle
and is balanced and I still have treats
it's still really healthy and stuff like
that sorry
yes I just want to explain that because
I noticed in my last vlog I said a lot
like oh you know I'm eating so bad and
oh you know I'll start eating healthy
Sirian like I'm trying to explain like
I'm trying to like apologize to someone
for eating bad but sometimes I think I
just need to chill out and be like it's
okay to indulge when you're on holiday
and when I get home I can go back into
my routine of eating really good not
consumption just wanted to apologize for
that because I do go on about it so you
might so need to stop it's not very
be and it's not very healthy when I have
a young audience that can be exposed to
that I guess I think it's a normal thing
to think it's a bad thing to eat bad
food so I do apologize but now I will
have a chicken salad when I eat good I
feel good so I'm gonna have some death
and I'm going to chill out for we played
Zelda
I got a Nintendo switch recently I have
another chance to play it sleeping in
England so catch up on that and chill
out I'm going to sign off for today when
you see me next it'll be the next day
it's going to rain tomorrow but I do
want to explore Brian so to be like okay
I'll see you guys good morning everyone
let me just make sure the door is locked
I had just had my breakfast and I just
had my shower now I'm going to go out
and explore writing so I could do a
little first shoot outside because I've
got a cute little beach box as well
later I have to do it and I'm loving how
I have an actually wonderful thing to
make at once for pina loving the mascara
still deny Brown's life makes life so
much easier and I'm going to wander
around with that planned that is the
plan like I like to do wander and look
at what I stumble across and then just
go from there instead of turning out too
many things because I don't know
sometimes response you know come across
something that you didn't know existed
so that should be good so I'm going to
venture outside now it is very cold
it is very gloomy again today so I'm
thinking I'm hoping that it's not going
to rain on me please so I'm gonna get my
stuff ready and then I'm going to take
you along on my little Breton
sightseeing it's bit just do any
experience what have you got to go
you
