been forever and a day since I've logged
I'm gonna do some baking today as well
which is going to be kind of fun because
I'm going to bake a recipe that I've
never tried before I have actually never
baked in my oven here before so it could
be such a big disaster I don't really
know yet I'm going to my PT at about
half an hour so I'll film our exercises
and the stuff that we're doing my bed
here right now is on point yeah I've got
PT I've got baking to do as opposed to
give away late is Tuesday the 11th of
April so I have to run down to the post
office and host a giveaway which I
announced today so go to post that to
her I'm getting six right now hey Nene
but I really miss vlogging I feel like
it's been so long I feel like England
might really love some other blog so I
figured I'm just going to take you along
with me say we're going to chill we're
going to hang out so just found a way to
change my text noise considering that I
am so incredibly obsessed with Zelda
right now I don't know if any of you
pray pray play Reza's a while but I'm
like chef Schneider funny
so attach my ringtone
and every time when I get a text I'm
going to be like I want to play so about
every time I sit down to get a pug
growing on me as well she's so sweet
he's six months now I reckon she's
actually fully grown but she's just a
super small bug but she's just such a
gorgeous little thing I love it so much
I'm actually planning to give away about
95% of my makeup well so you're always
dating me that is up but it is time to
go to PT and it's not at a time where I
sit in the car and I tell myself you go
to gym right now
you can have like a Hulk cake okay I
have met Jim now I just need to get
myself a bit of a pep talk
this is a load time where I sit in a
contemplate life and I contemplate the
pain I'm about to go sir so I still got
a piece a three times a week but you
like Monday I do buddy Wednesday and
then Lex again on Friday but it was
slugs yesterday so it's the cheese
sanding like today and it's gone the
thing I hate the most is lunges and
Jesse makes me do them the most because
they actually work the most Mel's why I
hate is mostly hurts
when you're going to do my hair I feel
like I'm saying like choke it open a
book Oh can't big that buck let's do 10
reps breath 1 2 good for MA
then this is oh my gosh I'm dead I don't
know why would today I got tied so fast
I think it's cuz I'm wearing like a
long-sleeve shirt I was like I'm dead
it's funny though because my PT who I'll
link her info down below her and I was
talking it down because they always talk
about what's going on on life or what
kind of stuff as well and we're talking
this is saying that such we have a gym I
look in the mirror like I have two worst
the worst chronic resting bitchface ever
and it really just makes me so sad that
like I can look really unapproachable
without realizing it like I think in my
mind that I look smiley all the time but
my resting face is like oh I know - I
just want a really badly sometime so if
you ever see me in real life or anything
like that and I look gronke it is my
face and I'm so sorry I just can't I
can't change as you to tell myself like
when I see people more like I'd such a
smile more but my like no teeth smile is
really like it looks
it's it I feel it looks like ah so
annoying having resting bitch face alone
I have returned home now and the plan is
I'm going to try and make some protein
banana bread right now which I have
never attempted to make before nor have
I ever begged in my oven before so I'm
assuming this is going to be a huge
disaster feel like I need a bigger open
openness okay so what are we doing I'm
so long it's Instagram Ross who 160
Celsius what we need to set the oven to
accredit set my oven on fire again well
this one normal height I'm going to have
to go down here so I put in to these of
protein powder to start with and then I
have three red bananas put some almond
milk coconut oil sea salt some baking
soda cinnamon egg honey and some vanilla
extract so I believe this recipe is
dairy free and gluten free which is
great I have absolutely no taste so
firstly I'm going to take a quarter cup
of melted coconut oil coconut oil is
great at heaps of healthy natural fats
which is super good so I'm going to go
ahead with a bananas and get some anger
out and mash these because boys are the
recipe didn't say like what ingredients
Todd wins
oops I'm gonna assume and go with what I
think is right fine bananas I smash your
arms I'm just like these are long like
Oh measurement oh yeah you can have a
guess or any I don't have like an
electric mixer or anything could be like
that so everything is going to be done
by hand so I'm getting a full body
workout you think about that way just
train legs doing my arm by baekje that
exists oh yeah I'm going to go and add
closely banana chip in it and then let's
see a little baby is going to lick the
whole lucky beanie doesn't she you know
sit good huggy - girl awesome bananas in
I'm going to add the coconut oil which I
melted and I'm just gonna scoop so I've
got a free-range egg here and you don't
want to add we have the eggs the banana
the protein powder and the oil in so far
I'm just going to go ahead and give it a
bit of a scooter if you like there's too
much coconut oil in here actually the
episode cup of coconut oil I'm like
that's a lot I've never caught up
what else about my teaspoon again it's a
half a cup of honey that is a lot of
funny I don't even think I have a much
funny left eye Sam's gonna win this so I
think it's about you I would say that's
about maybe needs to happen for the
stickiness that we make a lot of sense
enough next it says one teaspoon of
vanilla extract of perfect okay one
teaspoon of vanilla extract and then it
is 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and cinnamon
which I will show you from the amount of
evidence and mix it as much as I can
till there's no more bit because it's
lots of like banana and mushy bits that
it's chilling around that's what I
forgot so I've got to add slag or milk
so yes but it's the first time that I've
tried to line it in with baking paper
and yes it looks like a whole mess food
: so I'm going to add the butter into
this tin
and I'm just going to take my spatula
grab all the extra bits which we're not
missing out on any of them mixture some
are out at my she takes a picture see
how it is this is going to be so good
now for the scary part of putting in the
other I'm really screwed four times fell
asleep in the oven but I'm still
checking it and I get to look secure in
it to see if it's done risky to the
skewer and it helps that clean and this
is done it's ready to go see I'm such a
professional Baker alright so I'm going
to go ahead to the oven and we're going
to hope for a miracle to happen so just
put the bread in the oven
and the smell good it does smell good
doesn't it and then we're going to wait
and keep checking it because I had no
idea what I'm doing
so I've got a tea on the go ready where
it's all faith so here cut looking at
partly through the glass but face a
little bit
it smells ho good which I'm really happy
about I've just taken it out of the oven
and doesn't it look Laura goes I mean
not having any self raising flour
definitely different but oh my god this
smells so unbelievably and I cut myself
a little slice to try and I'm so excited
to see what it tastes like it's still
like boiling hot
it tastes like normal banana bread it's
so good it's like a really flat but on a
road and it actually need a little bit
long in the oven
I'm still a little bit moist me inside
but the top is burning a little bit so
Al's a bit like my smoke line here so
sensitive I really didn't want to turn
it off again and we'll give it another
10 minutes I reckon which would have
made it a total of 40 or 50 minutes in
the oven I think I grabbed it 3540 I
mean isn't enough but it still tastes
good so I had my slice as my dairy free
gluten free protein banana bread so that
one mouthful can't you it is a little
bit roll which sucks so if you do follow
my recipe like it tastes really good
it's just not cooked enough should have
given it a bit longer because some in
front a little bit raw
well Lisa didn't go down the kitchen
once again that's all that matters
logging it follow my snapchat would have
seen that time um that I might have been
kind of caught fire the baking paper
almost potato chips just decided to
catch fire and I was letter home
what do I do what did I do I googled
what to do when your oven is on fire
that was my first response fairly she
was like a sim you guys know like when
you're playing The Sims and the oven
catches on fire and they let you go
although with me so at least I don't
have to yesterday that's all that
matters
so that that wasn't bacon with Danny
where we don't tell about perfect base
we tell about not setting the kitchen on
fire now I'm going to go to the post
office and post this giveaway if you
don't follow my Instagram I am going to
be doing a few more giveaways over the
next few weeks and stars I was going to
pack a giveaway and post it off

photo shoot hence where Sam was dressed
