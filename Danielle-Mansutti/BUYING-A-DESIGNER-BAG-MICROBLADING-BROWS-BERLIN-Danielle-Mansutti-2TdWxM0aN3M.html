little before so as you guys know I have
micro bladed eyebrows which means that
when I do this you can see all the
little like brushstrokes underneath so
basically we're gonna darken that up a
little bit so my eyebrows need to be
matched

blonde so we're gonna head up to the
station now and tomorrow I'm going to
Berlin with a victor and a role that I'm
so excited about it because they are
like my favorites but as you guys know
Flowerbomb has been like one of my
ultimate favorites but the longest time
so I'm so like honored to be going on a
trip with him I literally can't wait

just parked a match yet my boyfriend's
place because going to London from he
was easier and beans is staying with him
and I'm away but you guys don't care
about that

today might be the day that I treat
myself to a designer bag because the
outfit that I'm wearing tomorrow is
really nice I don't have any like bags
that will go with it so it's perfect
excuse to go on a little bit of a bag
hunt today so it's good at London let's

with me
I've just arrived at the location for my
brows we are at the Georgia start our
ablution thank you and then also we've
got a bunch of like Amy's products this
one is a brow powder which I'm very
excited to try and these are brow
pencils and they look gorgeous
there's also some PEC handles as art and
they smell so good I'm very very pointed
so now we're gonna get the cream to pop
on my brows and um me up because
otherwise it would hurt a lot okay so
here's my before I've got to be a little
bit quiet because it's like 5:00 in the
morning I know how last night but the
Browns done painting a little bit I'm so
laughing I mean they're gonna look at me
how can they talk today and for the next
few days I go to the airport ain't
obviously staying here with Nick when
I'm away but yeah
about to go I'm very excited to meet
everyone here Paul kind of Berlin
we've just landed in Berlin we are now
heading off to get some lunch in the
Marriott hotel get ready and then it's
time for the event I deliver Matt from
the plane so I'm feeling like a
refreshed which is amazing but I'm in
beanie and foursome so excited to see it
I have made it to my hotel room and oh
my god real this room wait is in focus
yeah look and this massive mirror which
I'm just like dreaming about it is so
sleek and so nice I'm so exciting to
guys I did something really naughty
really naughty but I'm proud of myself I
feel like it's just like a nice present
to myself I caved and I bought myself a
really really nice and hag because as
you know I used to wear like all black
all the time I just black without black
so my bags are black I don't have any
like light bags and I'm about to wear a
really light-colored flowing floral
dress so any excuse to look at my new
baby isn't she gorgeous it's a Chloe bag
and I absolutely love it it is so
stunning we only have 20 minutes I have
to be ready for an event into a new
intern right now right now I look a bit
like a foot I have been awake since five
I am traveling not wearing a lot of
makeup and looking kinda bad so pray for
me that I will be ready full dress full
makeup in 20 minutes we have like a
little Berlin guide because oh she's so
cute
oh my god Bri bands but oh my oh my god
this okay Thank You Victor enroll oh my
god not to draw myself a flower ball I'm
so excited right pants this lovely good
I'm gonna get ready super super super
super quick hopefully we'll be a little
less stressed a little less a blow-up
next time we chat so chat to you when
I'm ready I do not know how I did it
but it's been 20 minutes and I'm ready
and I've earned this really really
gorgeous flowy dress which is from Lipsy
London and I haven't had any time to run
but anything this is all that I could do
with this 20 minutes that I had and I'm
gonna put on our high heels am I gonna
go to the flower bomb at nectar event
I'm so sorry so rush like this you have
to be in the lobby right now but I'm so
excited thinking about it I'm so excited
to guys along with me before I go though
I quickly have to spritz this guy on of
course this is the flab of nectar as you
can see I've already gone through so
much of my nerdy little flat lay station
just so you guys know what is going on
we have the three times here of all the
different flavor perfumes and nectar is
the most recent so cloud on the first
and it was twelve and they
some of the flowers and then here we
have yeah yeah
I feel like a real-life level
hello my love's I have just returned
back into my hotel room so the event was
so gorgeous like it was just so
beautiful and it could not have defined
album more than I did I look like I'm
naked I probably would never were
strapped this dress I just I felt like
dressing up because this this fragrance
has a lot of meaning saying that this
fragrance actually has like a whole lot
of meaning to me it's a story I don't
know I wear a bomb nectar all the time
already gone I'm already on my second
bottle I kept on threw a whole bottle in
the space of two months I guess I've
been wearing it so much and it's a smell
which reminds Nick of me so like I've
just gone through hits of it and it's
just something which is very special
between him and I like we just love this
scent together so I will just make an
effort at the event because it's such an
honor for me to be like invited to a
finger roll with it like it's just so
exciting because I've been such a big
fan of this since high school I swear I
want high school and stuff so that's why
your girl got like old you're home today
I've had such an amazing time with him
today and I love the group of girls that
we have on the event like I just I feel
really like it ease with them they're
just really really really nice girl so
I'm having a really really really really
nice time and we are about to run down
to grab some dinner and some drinks I'm
just going to quickly get like come for
your clothes only because if I went
heels for too long I get really moody
because I get in pain I'm just I'm go to
bed bitch I'm comfy I last a long
morning and check out always just
arrived oh my god this breakfast is
unreal and good morning everyone I'm
just packing my bag because we are like
home let's say we still have a full day
of activities but we are about to check
out of I tell so I'm just in the process
of you know recently have been troubling
way more which is a small carry-on
instead of like having a whole door
under the plane baggage and I've
actually found a way to do it to make it
super super super super easy it's like
all my outfits almost shoes everything
just in one little carry-on
and I am thinking about doing like a
pact with me videos soon or something
because I have learned over time I think
what to do and what definitely not to do
when it comes to packing so I'm just
gonna finish doing all this I have so
many beautiful little / themes from
Victor and Ralph heaps of little like
handbag ones as well a little thank-you
card and I just honestly cannot thank
them enough so we have a very quick
little chance to chat with fly around
downstairs and start today's activities
but honestly guys this has been one of
my favorite brand trips ever 100%
because the girls that are on this trip
like they are just so lovely and have
such a nice energy about them and I was
actually just saying it didn't last
night like there's not a single person
on this trip that you get like a bad
vibe about I am so big on energy and I
know I under % like there's some trips
for events or whatever where people are
quite negative and they might just come
up to you and start bitching about
another person and in my opinion the way
people speak about others is the way
they're gonna speak about you so I don't
really like that sometimes you know in
the beauty world it can be quite nasty
sometimes and I found the girls when
this trip were just so lovely like
they're such nice nice girl so I've had
such an enjoyable time if I'm being
honest with you guys there's sometimes
but I feel like I have to kind of be
someone else to fit in and be a bit
louder and feel like by being shy you
know people always perceive me as being
stuck-up or reserved but I'm just a shy
quiet person and all my videos I might
be a little bit louder sometimes but the
truth is in real life I'm really shy I
just find it easy to talk one-on-one
with people and then when I vlog or I'm
filming a video we are one-on-one so
that's why I probably come across a
little bit different because I'm very
into that in real life but the group
that I'm with I felt like instantly
comfortable with the students at down
with him at breakfast at the airport
yesterday and I knew that I could be
myself and that would be enough like I
didn't have to put on a bit of a show
and a song and a dance and act really
loud and confident like I could just be
myself and I'd be okay with that and
that is the most like relieving thing
ever just makes me so happy
even to the pike even to the fact today
we're going to do like a bit of
sightseeing around Berlin I've not felt
like any need to do a full face makeup
and stuff which I love like I love that
I've relaxed about that as you can see
like I've given my skin a rest today and
the brows are going strong so they are
looking good that obviously still a bit
dark they're gonna be a bit dark and
scary for a few more days
and I can't put makeup like anywhere
near them so you can see there's a
little bit of a line but I actually have
makeup on my eyelids or like around my
forehead I put a little bit of bronze on
my forehead but that's it my eyebrows
honestly like my life has changed
because the fact that I do not have to
sit for like an hour and do my eyebrows
is just the best thing ever
and we did such a good job with this
shape and everything they feel like so
symmetrical like I really really really
loved them so this time and we didn't
actually do Michael baiting she did
something what was it called missed
brows I think she called it where like
basically the needle she used on my
eyebrows was like was it have it was not
like one needle I had almost like 14
little needles and like she's like
dotted it on my face instead of like
dragging a micro blade it was just
constant like a woodpecker lit up um I
mean obviously it doesn't hurt because
you've got an aesthetic but if the
anesthetic cream obviously fades away
then it doesn't start hurting and feels
a bit frizzy but honestly it max like 2
or 3 out of 10 it's so fine but she's
done the best job but I just love the
fact that I can roll out of bed not put
on any eyebrow makeup I've got a tiny
bit of shape tape and I've got a tiny
bit of fat girl bang and then I've got
velvet teddy on my lips and that is it
today kiss my skin and needs a rest cuz
look I'm like yuck and now we're gonna
head off to do some of the activities
and then flying back to say Melbourne
fly back to London and I'm gonna go
straight to net expands as it NYX NYX
been taking beans to work it's so cute
if you follow her Instagram you like see
all that stuff and then
just have a nice chill Friday night with
him I'm so excited to just see him and
debrief or just cuddle and then it's a
long weekend this weekend so that is
very exciting this will be up on
Wednesday I'm pretty sure so I hope you
guys had a great weekend and I don't
filming this it is Friday so just before
I stopped mattering I'm using my canon
g7x instead of my sony you know filter
even camera so this camera this vlog
should be a lot less shaky a lot better
quality and just smooth so let me know
if you've noticed a difference from my
normal vlogs because normally it would
be like really shaky bit it's like
stable which is nice obviously for me it
doesn't feel to my face it doesn't put
airbrush on my face but I I like a few
weeks ago I decided I want to stop
hiding myself so I've stopped using my
like filtering camera you like what you
see is what you get now and more like
airbrushing stuff like everything's
gonna be real and yeah so let me know
what you think of the quality but we're
gonna run downstairs and we are gonna do
some activities I will show you my
outfit before I leave but I'm very very
exactly for today a bit of a shame I was
gonna wear that Zara coat that you guys
saw my hole from last week but it just
didn't work so I mean I so unfortunately
only because I'm trying not to but I'm
in luck again today now that she might
only option because I just like the coat
with this black top it just look wrong
so today I am back in all black which
isn't really ideal but I can't really do
anything about it just don't really have
any other choice so wearing this so I'm
just wearing black knit from Zara that
you guys saw in my haul this leather
jacket I do know it's wrong but I will
link it let me have my bag which I am so
in love with these leggings are from
River Island and my shoes are just these
black about it heels as super super
super comfortable for walking around
which is what we will be doing today so
that is what I'm wearing I was
by my side I could it just looked like
classy and wrong and weird with the
blacks there what a damn shame two sides
