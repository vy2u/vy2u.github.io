going on next door or something and it
is so loud so it's gonna be a bit noisy
today so when I went to school I wasn't
really allowed to wear makeup but I
still did because you know rebel and I'm
so sick of seeing all these like
tutorials for back to school makeup with
like high-end makeup and expensive
things and eyelashes an eyeshadow I'm
sorry but I do not know what kind of
school would allow that so this isn't me
especially for you ozzie girls because
we are not only on makeup at school so
this is how to get around it this is how
I got around it I did go few detentions
and it's goreng makeup but it's worth it
it was worth it
this one does have a color on it and I
love will don't like the fact that it
has a color I was going to clean the
primer on my finger okay and my mirrors
here as you can see so if I keep looking
that's why so I'm just gonna what I do
is I kind of rub it between my two
fingers and then we're going to cool
it's in my hair good start and my face
is really boiling hot because I just got
my eyebrows tinted and I ghost burning
because whatever they use on it wasn't
nice and my skin is not happy with me
right now okay so now I am all primed
and I am ready to go and actually tell
you how much it was but I am missing the
prices because I've just run up to Kmart
and bought all this stuff on a budget
for you guys okay so the primer was $13
95 which isn't too bad I mean
considering how ridiculously expensive
high end can be like oh I was gonna go
grab this Gardea BB cream um I've just
bought it so this is sort of like a half
person person flow okay so that she
looks like this see um
I got the shade medium because I thought
with my turn I guess I've been medium
through I've got the lighting is so
terrible I'm so sorry I'm going to put
this in sections of my face so forehead
nose and in my cheeks and I was going to
be using as always the Real Techniques
buffing brush you do not need to buy
this so when I was at school I use my
fingers so whatever you are comfortable
with just going to start with this much
I look so attractive right now I'm just
going to see how we go with the BB cream
because I think that obviously
foundation is just way too noticeable
for school especially in Australia and
England as well cause I have been to
high school in both England and
Australia and in both high schools I got
in trouble for me
mmm this is lovely okay so it does just
it's the lightest coverage but it's all
you need you seriously don't want to go
OTT at school I last nights but my not
researching these back to school makeup
tutorials to see just what everyone else
is doing just so didn't repeat something
else two products whatever and I was
just like in tears because I was
thinking okay so if I imagine myself
being at school again do I really think
that I've got out to like Mac and nas
and Bobby Brown and whatever for my
school makeup I was like are you guys
insane cause you can't afford that
you're in school like you have a
part-time job at McDonald's like who can
afford mac makeup on a McDonald's wage
seriously nice nice BB cream going on
all right so what I'm gonna do is learn
the dance my neck because you don't
wanna be that girl in school
with the orange band oceany grows line
on your neck I'm just blending that in
or a my neck okay so I think I fixed the
lighting issue um I'm just carrying on
with burning it through my neck and all
that good stuff I know some of you guys
don't like it when I'm not looking
straight at the camera but I'm sorry my
mirror is literally fixed in one place
so I'm like I don't love this being a
cream it's so pretty it's just like
refreshed skin um what should we do I
mean honestly I would go to school just
like this but I have to give you guys
some sort of tutorial next I'm going to
bronze up my cheeks so I'm using the
Rimmel natural bronzer as you can tell
it's like come on Danny got my sweat
some want to get some more but can't be
bothered I'm just using this on like an
angled contour brush as always this
whole sure oh guys you don't need to buy
the brushes I'm using they're just the
ones I have available sitting next to me
you can you know improvise in my makeup
hacks when I show you how to do a
bronzer to tour of a bronzer brush from
like any other brush so don't worry just
for some below okay and I like to do it
on my eyelids but let's turn it to you
guys I just do it because makes my eyes
a little bit bigger if you're going to
school you have the most ridiculous
hours in the world I will never forget
how I how early I had to get up
I'm so glad school's over V what you're
going to love is concealer and I'm going
to give you a choice of I wanna do like
two different ones and see what the guys
this elf concealers only three dollars
which is a steal if you are at school
because I mean come on we can't afford
feelers for concealer so after your
sleepless hours of being on folks we're
going on at being on YouTube or not
being on tumblr all night and having no
sleep waking up at 6:00 in the morning
you go to school we all need a little
bit of help from
sealers so I'm going to go in with my
ELF concealer in ivory this is like a
chalky matte kind of concealer I do also
have a choice if you won't have a liquid
concealer I recommend this may range
from for birthday something whatever
it's called concealer and I'm just going
to do a little bit of a line underneath
my eyes but not doing too much grabbing
a concealer brush and just blending that
out like this okay so I'm only going to
do the concealer on my eyes I'm not
going to do any contouring on my nose or
anything like that because I just think
it's a little bit too intense for school
okay next with my eyebrows I haven't
gotten tinted today so they're like
ridiculously dog they look so stupid I
know
so going to go with my models preferred
brow liner this is also from Priceline
and it cost me about $10 I have to
double check that month you guys all I'm
going to do I'm not going to fill in any
of the inside of my eye I'm going to
zoom in now so you guys can see it's all
done so firstly I'm just going to brush
out all the hairs I'm still at least $72
I was like 60 Soza and I'm simply just
going to fill in the outside
my tail and that's it I'm not going to
touch the front of my eyebrow so so far
we're looking quite glowy and natural
like we don't look too like cakey and I
think the glowy doing products are
definitely better when it comes to
school time because you're really mad
and pretty orange it yet you'll stick
out like a sore thumb yeah so I'm just
going to curl my eyelashes and I'm using
my essence I love extreme crazy volume
mascara
this one is 495 so I'm inclined I mean
especially because it always makes you
want to cry how cheap makeup is
everywhere else except for us Aziz and
also frosty knees we have to pay so very
much more money for our stuff so this
tutorial I specifically picked out
products which are like so audible and
know that it now looks a lot more
noticeable that you're wearing makeup
with mascara but you know what if you
get in trouble for having mascara on you
tell that teacher to fix their priority
can you tell I hope future Chin's in
school yeah whoops I'm not being a good
role model am I look I know we're in
America you guys have a lot more freedom
with the way that you look especially
with your makeup I like specifically
went to Kmart like you know I'm gonna
wear a shirt so like I'm go to school
and you can't even see it
oh you know feel free to put on powder
or whatever and for me I feel like this
is the perfect amount of makeup to
school for uni work because um you look
naturally beautiful and you don't look
caked I think that's the biggest thing
is looking caked is so easy I can just
do one more step and all of a sudden
you're like oh my god did someone just
like shoot I got a perm makeup on my
face
yeah that was a really bad one yes I'm
gonna do some sexual close-ups we guys
no see my my comfy closer I know that my
eyebrows were looking a bit hilarious
today please give me work I just get
into did like right now
um and the lady didn't wipe off my ten
so I came home and we're like black
eyebrows so I was like thanks all right
guys so I'll do the close-ups now and
then I'll have a chat with you at the
end
I know guys it's obvious is the u.s.
going to finish because the Sun has just
come up and oh my god I cannot see I
would also probably type my hair like
this I've literally just put it around I
know my types are showing me a break
alright so if I were to go to school
today I would probably just have my hair
like this because it's so simple and you
don't want to go to the top of school
because if you have like a crazy
hairstyle it's so annoying to keep up at
school like boo and I always get these
little bits down so like I have some
crazy science and then I'm just going to
get this and scratch the top of my hair
just to get some volume and stuff so as
you can see now it looks a bit more sort
of fun avoid mess and from behind my
hair will just tease it a little bit
like this and scrunch it up a couple my
takes yeah so that is how I would wear
my hair to school as well as the makeup
I would wear to school
this also exploit uni work everything
like that so yeah
