today's video I'm answering your
questions from the last few weeks on
Twitter and I'm so excited because it's
a bunch of questions in here that I've
never answered before pug case still
going strong guys okay first question is
who was the last person you held hands
with um last person I held hands with it
was about a week ago just after I got my
today done I went and saw my friends for
dinner and then we all like all four
more some holding hands down Chapel
Street and it was really weird who are
you looking forward to seeing as you're
watching this it's Friday I'm filming
this on Sunday because I'm pretty
filming for England so if you are
unaware as you're watching this I'm
currently in England I'm so excited to
see my family in England they're the
reason why I'm going over because one of
my family members is sick so we are
going over there to spend time with them
but like I like to see that I'm so
excited to spend time with them do you
think you'll be in a relationship two
months from now
whoa no I don't at all I am a single
Pringle at the moment completely single
and actually like I liked having the
independence too so just focus on myself
only so I don't think I will be and I
think it's very hard because I don't
know if I'll be living in Melbourne next
year that way you can feel a little bit
hard but in terms of like a relationship
I don't think I'm at the right point in
my life right now if something came
along I just meant to be that it's meant
to be but right now I don't think I'll
be in a relationship for a long time
okay would you kiss the last person you
kissed again mmm
probably not too dangerous what are your
bad habits
I was just doing it then as well my bad
habit this is so gross I picked the skin
around my nails do it when I'm nervous
I can nose when I film so I'm like you I
also bite my nails I also make that
noise before I talk I go like um I need
to stop doing this is so annoying
my mom doesn't as well so I got it from
you mom what part of your body are you
most uncomfortable with Wow I feel like
every girl can kind of relate to me here
but I can't say I've ever woken up in
the morning and look slimmer being like
damn I love my stomach I don't like my
stomach I never have fast because we're
women we get bloated sometimes at some
times we eat like one slice of peach and
it looks like with nine months pregnant
so it's very hard to say have any of
your exes told you that they regret
breaking up well these questions today
man um yes and everything happens for a
reason so you have to think of why you
guys broke up in the first place and if
you're better off now
have you ever liked someone and never
told them well yes I like someone right
now and I'm not telling you this a lot
of the time yeah if I like someone
unless like we get really close if it's
just like that awkward stage where you
don't really know each other at all and
no one's making the first move then of
course I won't say anything but um yes I
guess well thanks you get out of bed in
the morning breakfast is my favorite
meal of the day and I stuffed my face
full of sugar and it's really bad but I
love breakfast so what is something
irritating you right now the man who is
right there outside my window banging
stuff with a hammer and it's Sunday it's
like sure why are you working on a house
egg thanks trainee guy go back to this
is chasing ever okay no I don't believe
it is I don't think there's any reason
why cheating should be okay I mean like
I hate when you watch movies and like
isn't about relationship and they meet
someone who's really nice and suits them
better and a new cheat on a partner and
you made to think it's a good thing that
they did that because they've found
someone that like respects them now and
stuff but not at all if you like someone
else and you're in a relationship Ling's
breakup that person first and don't put
them through the process of being
cheated on and having trust issues and
I'm still with that it's so much easier
to break up with them and then get with
the person you want to get with kids
cheating is not okay doesn't matter if
you're married to someone 50 years you
should be with the person that you want
to be with forever and if you think
about cheating on them but you're not
with the right person
I have been cheated on many times so I
know that it is not a nice feeling and I
would definitely say there is no excuse
as to why it should be okay here would
you really like to just punch in the
face
Donald Trump do you hold grudges I'm a
Scorpio I am a professional at holding
grudges I will tell someone that I think
you've been but I will never forget it's
more like mistreat me once and we'll
figure it out whatever but do it to me
twice and I'm like done what is
something you hide about your
personality well we that I'm a
over-thinker and extremely sensitive I
try and hide that as much as I can like
if someone's joking around with me or
teasing me or something then I will
obviously like respond and humor and be
like oh shut up whatever but deep inside
I'm just like you're crushing my soul
what is the last supporting event that
you watch um if you're not a spy person
like me then give this video a big
thumbs up because my god I'm the least
sporty as fans in the world
I actually have no idea so my family are
huge Liverpool fans you'll never walk
alone my dad
rather watch the Watchers downstairs
that's probably the one thing I've
watched recently but I honestly will do
anything to get out of anything sport
related when I was in school I used to
like try and prevent being in like PE
game sport class whatever you got to
call it and every single time that we
had a PE class whatever I would tell the
teacher that I was really bad cramps and
I'm period is so heavy like our play
sport oh and I like forged a note from
my mom saying like Danny is really
unwell today I can't contribute to any
physical exercises sorry mum I used to
do that
Oh time teachers were just under this
impression that I had the world's
longest period because I tried
everything to get out of some sport I
hated it so much I was just like thank
you I'm just gonna sit here and write or
draw I thought I hated it so much thank
you for watching this Q&amp;amp;A today I hope
you got to know me a little bit better
and know I don't actually have the
world's longest period it's just a joke
I'll see you guys very soon I love you
