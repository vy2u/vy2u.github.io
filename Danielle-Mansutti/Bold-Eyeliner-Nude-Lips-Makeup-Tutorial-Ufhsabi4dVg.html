slow Excel Dante's video because I am
working for my favorite brands in the
entire world I'm so excited
this video is brought to you by Sephora
we are going to be focusing on for a
collation today I created to like a
really nice versatile bold wind Anna
look paired with a beautiful a new
lipstick so the majority of the products
you will see in this video are like a
one brand or Sephora collection which is
an amazing brand and I can't get enough
of it I did have to use a few different
brands but my eyebrows and my mascara so
of course I'll leave all of the info
about sapporo collection products that
I'm using in my description bar if you
want to go ahead and follow the for
collection Instagram that would be
amazing
and last but definitely not least if you
aren't part of my family in the world to
me if you would hit that subscribe
button right Laura I would love you to
be part of our family so if you'd like
to see how I create this really classic
cat eye look quite a nice nude bold lip
then please keep watching and to begin
today we are going to use Sephora
collection 10 hour wear perfection
foundation and this one is in the shade
medium 32 F let's just go for it guys
time for some lawless skin first
foundation shade matches my tan really
well so you will notice it's a little
shades darker than my natural skin tone
but it is perfect for my neck because I
fake tan a lot easier I do have if you
complete one please right now so this
condition is really good for just
covering it up completely because the
coverage and this is really good so now
that we have our base on what I like to
do now is actually go in and do it the
eyes before I do my powder and my
contouring what kind of stuff because I
feel it is much easier to clean up when
you do it first with a kind of really
pretty so like bold winged liner and I'm
so excited because it's the most
versatile look ever and you can use it
for literally anything it's amazing I'm
going to doom you guys in up
and firstly today for my brows I'm going
to use the anastasia beverly hills
dipbrow it's wears in the shade dark
brown and you can buy this at sephora so
i'm going to put this on my brows
firstly of course I have to get it fully
brush and get all this foundation out of
my brows then I will start to fill in
these bad boys
now that eyebrows are done we're going
to go ahead and use this absolutely
gorgeous Sephora collection glitter this
one is called Hollywood calling and all
my goodness it is so beautiful so what
we're going to do is I'm just going to
put a little bit on my fingers and I'm
going to apply it directly onto my lid
and once it passed on is going to take a
brush and blend it in that's what should
be our thing eyes shadow color I'm going
to use this one like a really pretty
shimmery effect on the lid and also just
to deepen it up a little bit so this
color is absolutely perfect next moving
on to it Sephora collection fine line
liquid eyeliner so as you can see this
is such a really fine gorgeous eyeliner
we're going to create a really pretty
cut I with this and I'll show you how I
do it
the most important thing about eyeliner
the reason why I'm doing this before my
powder is that it is easy to clean up if
you do it first so my eyeliner is never
perfect on the first time so it's
completely 5 yours is messy because it
can always be clean as that's the most
important thing to realize so we're
going to aim to do is imagine that this
line on our lower lash line continues
upwards I'm going to have the most
pressure sort of here and then release
the pressure as you go upwards once you
create a line like that we're going to
start from the top of the line and then
it drag it down onto the top of my lash
line so I'll demonstrate this for you
now it will not be perfect on first go
but we will clean up to make it look
flawless
and once you have the basic outline like
this we're going to fill in all of the
middle then I'm going to keep going
across check out here on my lashline
so once your wing is looking a little
bit like this we're going to clean it up
really easily so all you need is a
concealer and concealer brush so I think
I bit of concealer to my eye like this
but I'm going to take a concealer brush
and we're going to clean this line up
and make it super sharp I do this every
time I do a nurse and trust me I can
never do it perfect on first go and I'm
just going to cut out the bottom line
now that our wings are finally complete
it's time to put on some mascara on the
top as well I'm going to be using this
Too Faced better than sex mascara which
you can buy at Sephora as well this is
in the waterproof version it's amazing I
love it and how nice the color color is
very beautiful and I'm just going to
wiggle this onto my lashes to make sure
they look nice and long because long
lashes look so nice with the bold winged
liner now we're using Sephora collection
colorful shadow and liner in let it snow
this is so highly pigmented a absolutely
adore it the reason why I'm doing this
is it helps to make your eyes look super
open and super big and full it's just a
nice little touch to add to the eye look
as well then it's Ontario Sephora
collection a bright future gel serum
concealer this is in it shaved 9 stable
and we're going to place this underneath
our eyes just to ensure that it is nice
and bright and away computable just be
super careful that you don't mess up
that line because then that will be a
nightmare now using a Sephora collection
matte perfection powder foundation this
is in shade 42 warm 10
going to lightly dust this over my face
just to make sure that it is nice and
matte and even and we have qt2 coverage
because you can't go wrong with a snake
the coverage I'm also going to lace down
on my neck as well to make sure that
it's all even beautiful and now using a
Sephora collection bronzing face powder
it's as it is in Canary Islands number
seven I believe I believe that's J I'm
going to use this brush as well it is
the pro air brush from Sephora going to
make sure to tap off the excess of
course I'm just going to use this to do
a little bit of sculpting and contouring
with the bronzer we seriously love this
brush it's so beautiful and lychee is
like an airbrush it blends out really
really really well and here we have a
Sephora collection Rouge bomb and it is
the most perfect color I've ever found
it's just so beautiful so I'm just going
to pass on to my lips I just think that
I knew is just perfect for this kind of
look because it is just such a versatile
easy look to wear so I thought I would
definitely pair it with a nude
so bearing to love it this used to be a
final look I really hope you guys enjoy
this video today I like creating really
wearable looks like this so please let
me know if you enjoy something a little
less like glam dramatic a little bit
more like I can definitely wear this
every day so I hope you guys enjoy this
video and so much fun making it I'll see
you all very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
