today's video we're gonna be talking
about breakups and bad relationship it
is sort of a hard thing to talk about
this video will be very similar in style
to stuff like my video about bullying my
video about depression I would
appreciate it so much if you guys were
quite respectful about this video in the
comments and stuff like that because
it'd mean the world to me the whole
intention of this video is to help you
guys out with advice when it comes to
breakups and all what kind of goods to
help think your iron you to my channel
than hello and welcome to the family my
name is Danielle I've been in two
serious relationships in my life my
first relationship was when I was in
high school and that was about two years
and then in between that and my next
wish it were always sort of like are we
seeing each other are we dating
are we official we're not official kind
of things they are the worst and then I
had a three and a half four year
relationship so the topic of breakups is
one of which I have definitely
experienced and gone through recently
so now it's time for us all to get quite
deep and meaningful in this video
oh boy to start so bad relationships I'm
sure we've all experienced maybe even
about friendship at the end of the day
it does sort of come down to your
self-worth and how you see yourself if
you are strong and you're independent
and you don't need people then you don't
let people sort of screw you over but if
you're someone like me that just trusts
everyone and thinks everyone's going to
change and thinks everyone's got the
best intentions in the world you end up
giving them second chances and third
chances and tenth chances and the
hundredth chances you keep being taken
for granted
you're never appreciated I feel like in
yourself if you know that you don't want
to be with this person forever or you
know that they make you miserable or you
know that they make you sad then why are
you with them if it's because you're
lonely and you find it hard to connect
with people when you connect with them
you will find someone else it does sound
like such a cliche thing like oh you'll
move on plenty fish in the scene
whatever but you do need to remember
that this is just one person your
laughs and you are probably I'm assuming
a very young person and someone that
doesn't need that kind of energy in your
life anyway in my past relationships
I've had quite different experiences and
different breakups and different
problems in some previous relationships
like I've been cheated on quite a lot
with ex-girlfriends which is always a
little bit weird I've had a guy who
treated me really horribly in high
school and dealer horrible things to me
dealt with guys that are just sneaky and
just lie to me all the time and guys
that just use me for when it's
convenient for them and all that kind of
stuff so I know what it's like to go
through heartbreak and I know what it's
like to deal with people that don't
treat you the way that you should be
treated like you deserve a lot better
than that we all seem to settle for less
than we deserve just so that we don't
end up alone because being alone is the
worst thing in the world oh my god I
want to be alone it is so much better to
be alone and we're dealing with someone
that is making you and your life so much
harder it's one thing you really have to
remember is that you are so important
and I do not want you to forget that you
are so important and your feelings come
first when a breakup happens it happens
because either one of you knows that
something is wrong and there are
actually perfect relationships in the
world there are some relationships which
you know people will be markedly to use
and they're deeply mapping and love and
if you know that something is wrong in
your relationship and you know it's not
going to work out I know it's so I've
not run back to it because it's what
you're used to but one day you will look
back and you'll just laugh and you think
why did I waste so much time like being
so miserable over something that could
have been like solved so quickly if I
just left earlier with my own broke up I
feel like the most important thing for
me to do it was to be extremely private
and respect his privacy as well I was in
him for three and a half to four years
and I feel like not seeing him after we
broke up is one of the best decisions
that you could do if you can't keep
seeing them again to chat and talk
things through you're just going to end
up
together again it's inevitable it was so
hard to have someone that I've spoken to
every single day of my life who was my
best friend and everything and then one
day you never speak to them again I look
back now I think I am so much happier he
is so much happier it was the best thing
that we could have done for each other I
am someone who talks a lot on Twitter
about my life and everything so I was
trying really hard to just not say
anything and I still haven't told anyone
outside of my close friends the reason
of why we woke up or when we woke up or
the situation because it really isn't
anyone's business that mine and his
still get asked now even though it was
months ago like a long time ago now
people still comment like are you guys
still together individual so for me
having a relationship in the public eye
was very difficult and it's very
difficult when people are assuming
things about my relationship assuming to
the point that you cheated on me with my
friends and all this stuff which isn't
true I didn't want to share anything
about my breakup because like I don't I
didn't have to I didn't have to and I
would have felt really guilty if I did
that's sort of like the general gist of
my breakup as well most important thing
that I've learned was it gets better it
really gets better I reckon after
breakups it's a good about two to three
weeks of just the most full-on miserable
just everything is all your empty all
the time you're crying all the time
you're grieving like breakups you grieve
and it's okay like people grieve when
they lose partners and then those
relationships and stuff like that
and it's just part of the process if you
didn't grieve that's more worrying than
if you are grieving because it's like
what was something that wired up from
flee or did you like not love the person
or something you have every single right
in the world to sit with your tub of ice
cream and watch a movie and boil your
eyes out cry it out you feel so much
better after crying because it relieves
so much stress talk to your friends see
your friends going
do things just do what you feel like
it's gonna make you happy for me I
actually turned to my work when I was
going through my breakup actually worked
my butt off as a distraction so I keep
filming and everything and I was being a
little actress you guys couldn't
actually tell when I had my breakup
because when I was talking to the camera
I was just like well a lot a lot a lot
I'm just pretending like nothing
happened about three weeks after we
broke up I really just hit a point where
I woke up one day and I'm like I
actually feel okay today like I don't
feel sad I don't feel empty I just feel
normal again after the first day of the
break-up you need to realize that's
going to be the worst day and it will
get easier and easier and easier it's
actually positives to being single at 21
you know I just want to go and grab a
plane ticket and go travel the world I
can do it I want to go out in the
weekend
I can do it if I want to look a certain
way or worse oh and dress or whatever I
can do it without being commented on
about how it looks too sure many of you
like me and are people who no matter
what you put their happiness before
yours and it never works out well for
you because you're left being like so
now I'm doing it for me when I need help
if you are someone that has a lot of
friends
please use up your advantage and go into
your friends and do stuff with your
friends even if which is going out for
coffee goes the movies like anything you
will find I'll be in mind while you're
out with your friends you will not be
thinking of the person you just broke up
with it will be like it didn't even
happen and you'll be in a completely
different mindset and just feel so happy
I was going to throw a lot of that time
and unfortunately I don't really have
anyone there for me at that time my mom
was my rock at that time during my
breakup and she was always there for me
but when it came my friends it was more
because I wasn't really reaching out to
them or anything
normally they're for me so I had to sort
of make my own way of getting myself
better reaching out to new people and
making friends with new groups of
friends and sort of like pulling away
from my old life my old relationship and
experiencing a new chapter of my life
and it's very hard when you have such
low self esteem after a breakup and
you're miserable and everything to
message someone you
they would like to hang out for the
weekend and that's something that I did
occur over it was a few months after my
breakup was something I message in our
girlfriend that I haven't seen him so
long if we wanted to go out on the
weekend and she was like of course like
I haven't seen you in so long it'd be so
much fun and it ended up being one of
the best nights of my life
you can't expect everything to come to
you during the hard time in the break-up
sometimes you have to reach out to
others to help you a very valuable
lesson when it comes to bad
relationships is to not give too many
chances because you will then suffer the
consequence of being a doormat and then
walked all over and I've been there so
many times it's actually something that
I still do I just give them too many
chances to screw you over and hurt me
so they know that when they do have in
the future it's just going to slide
because I don't really react much to
what I guess if I put my foot down I
might know like you shouldn't treat me
like that that's really horrible and
really nasty then they'd be like oh wait
a minute she's actually really hot and I
might lose her and oh my god you know so
sometimes you do put your foot down you
may feel like a horrible person but
being assertive and standing up yourself
there is nothing wrong with that and you
shouldn't feel like a peach or feel like
really horrible for doing that because
you're not you're just sticking up for
yourself because if you're not going to
stick up for yourself no one else will
you are going through a breakup then
hear this through me it gets better and
you will actually feel a lot more
confident eventually you will feel a lot
more sort of independent and just feel
like strong and strong independent woman
you will bump into someone is like I
like this girl's confidence like this is
awesome you will feel I'm never gonna
like find someone again and I don't feel
like I'm good enough for anyone and blah
blah blah but trust me give it like two
months and you'll look back and you will
laugh and be like I'm fine now and
please know that if you need a friend
during your breakup I'm always going to
be your friend I'm always going to be
here and I always try to offer as much
advice as I can so if you are going
through a tough time or anything like
that it will get better I promise
and we can all chat in the comments down
below if you are experiencing a bad time
in your life or anything
we can sort of help each other out and
use other YouTube community on a little
fam City family for the best possible
reason and that would be awesome to see
I have so much chalk in my head I'm just
like why should I say what interesting
so that's all for me today if you would
like to know anything else about
breakups oh I had a deal things and what
kind of stuff and please leave a comment
below I'll try and get back to you and
I'll talk to you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
