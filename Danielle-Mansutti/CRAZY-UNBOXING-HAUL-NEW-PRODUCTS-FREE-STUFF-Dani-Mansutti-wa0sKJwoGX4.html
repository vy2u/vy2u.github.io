insane haul unboxing kind of video this
is like all the suffers accidentally
being sent to my Australian peer box or
old Australian address since I moved to
London and there's a lot of it so this
interest can be very short and sweet if
you don't really subscribe to my channel
I would love you to hit that big red
button down below I put up two new
videos every single week if you put a
little bell on you will get my
notifications as well when I upload

books from a mecca which is always so
exciting because I can't wait to see
what's in here
oh my god I just like my head oh my god

like my ultimate Saviour when it comes
to my skin the converse super model

oh my god that is some good packaging
how cool is that moisturizer but it's
silver no it's like that it's a matte
moisturizer it smells so good oh my god
so there's also a glow starter Sun glow
I don't know how I haven't heard of it
is because I love grand works very much
so it's like this I'm assuming I'm
hopeless at this stuff you got hydrated
glory and ice we're good this is like I
thank him I face the things I don't have
a part of like this so now there's the
product which is the moisturizer but it
actually isn't a tinted moisturizer it's
actually a her glowy and moisturizer
yes there's also another one of these
this one is in the shade this one is in
the color no just wanted in that
whatever
he'll blow so that was obviously a lot
less Wow there's also the firming
treatment that sounds like silver on the
inside it's like the coolest thing ever
and lastly oh my god the packaging this
is a makeup setting spray from glen glow
