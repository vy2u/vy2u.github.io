today we have a very last-minute easy
Halloween tutorial I started to be very
basic hello in to term today because I
just kind of feel like it's something
that I would wear to a Halloween party I
absolutely loved what she didn't really
like gory Halloween tutorials but
unfortunately my skill set is not quite
there yet
so we have a cute little cat it's 10
today so I hope you guys enjoy this
Halloween tutorial today if you're not
subscribed already and then all you do
is click that big red button down there
I've been up to new videos every week
and I would love you to be part of the
family so without further ado let's jump
into our starting with a fresh face if
it is the mecca cosmetic a primer today
to make sure my skin is ready for the
ridiculous amount of makeup we're about
to fly and then I'm using the Kat Von D
lock-it foundation in medium 53 warm and
guys I am currently obsessed with
foundation it's my new Holy Grail the
coverage is amazing like it is amazing
and then I'm going to make sure it's all
padded onto my face and then as always
used my dip brow pomade and dark brown
on my eyebrows and I'm going to run
through the base quite quickly because
those who are subscribe to me know I do
quite similar thesis every single time
and then I was in the Kat Von D lock-it
to concealer underneath my eyes to make
sure my skin is now fresh and alive and
awake and all that good stuff and I'm
also going to put a little bit
underneath my cheekbones before apply my
nice pressed powder in the shade Beach
over everything to make sure it is set
in place I just did that all in one
breath oh my god I'm using the Too Faced
sun body bronzer on my cheekbones my
temples and on my chin as well
then with a Becca champagne pop
highlight I am the best
the whole time I swear to God obsessed
putting on my cheekbones down my nose
and on my Cupid's bow now using this
corrupt black eyeshadow and I'm firstly
going to map out the crease of my eyes
just above the crease actually and
mapping it out it's kind of like a cut
crease but it's a lot Messier because we
don't have to be too specific and then
grabbing a napkin and I'm going to add
more of corrupt on and start blending it
through and with black as it is a really
tricky color just add little bits and go
very very very slowly because if you do
too much it's a nightmare to clean up
then it was in the citrine a glitter by
motives and I'm going to apply this all
over my lid just underneath the line
where we made that little cut crease
now using this tart eyeliner I'm just
going to map out a quite a thin wing on
my eyes I'm going to end the wing where
we finished the cut crease as well so
they meet there in the middle
now using the cheat sheet 3d magic lash
a golden ollie of mine I'm just going to
play a little bit of mascara before
going on to falsies later I'm using this
burnt orange matte shade from Anastasia
Beverly Hills and I'm applying this on
my lower lash line first and I'm going
to go over that with the corrupt shadow
I'm using that orangey Shay first make
sure it's all blended nicely and has a
bit of a gradient then we will go in
with the black and deepen everything up
dark and everything up and just go crazy
so I'm going to stop the black eyeshadow
bout Midway because I will be using an
angled brush just to make a bit of a cat
eye effect with the eyeliner here
I'm gonna make sure that everything is
nice and blended and then apply that
Tarte eyeliner once again and use the
pencil side this time
and I'm going to apply some ice by Luna
lashes I've used these about four or
five times in the stool and very good
condition so I'm going to apply some old
Luna lashes that I have because I
thought why not just use these and I'm
going to put them on my lashes and these
are be perfect lashes for cat eye look
because they are created to give you an
almond cat eye shape so I definitely
recommend looking into getting some ice
while Luna lashes to create this look
now using that glitter once again I'm
going to apply it quickly in my inner
corners and then applying this Anastasi
Beverly Hills liquid lipstick I'm going
to apply it onto my lips and I've left
all the products in the downbar for you
guys if you want to go and check
anything out or couldn't understand my
accent or I'm talking too fast I get out
is check in the description and then I'm
going to apply some eyeliner onto my
nose to create little cat nose just play
with this I didn't do it perfectly
breath look there whatever and my camera
cut out but I did do some little
whiskers and some little dots on my face
as well
and so here is the official look if you
