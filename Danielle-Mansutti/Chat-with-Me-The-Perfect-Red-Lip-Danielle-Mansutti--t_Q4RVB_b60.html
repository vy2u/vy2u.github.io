you'd like to get some sort of going out
dinner date look like this then just
keep watching um I'm going to just start
by putting this on my brush my C's Mac
Studio big this one yeah um I found that
ended up being really cakey and I'm over
and I don't know I I'm in love with
Lauren Curtis and uh she's always
wearing what about rematch stop so I
decided to give it a go and I'm actually
like too much um I thought that I was
going to be been weird about it just
because it's a lot cheaper to your bigs
but hey no but I recommend it to anyone
go on bail with this one like it's just
a lot more natural and I think that's
good it's when I was with like all of
young guys or a lot of really heavy
coverage just because I didn't like the
way that I move to whatever and now that
I'm older I'm used to it
it doesn't really matter so yeah anyway
dig there so yeah I'm using Australia's
because I've run out of money what I do
is that I'll just brush through them
take them a certain shape and
it only takes me quite a few guys to do
this second um yeah I just struggled
with eyebrows you can I do them
religiously every day so I just didn't
read out like that and then I just get
brush which is a nude by nature brush I
rather done um sorry I'm just going to
start with concealing under my eyes just
cause they very tired today I was
working last night to midnight and now I
am so tired a whole life I've been
really um self-conscious about things
just because I don't have easiest school
life and this is getting really cheap so
I've always been a bit worried about my
face just because when I was really
little I used to get a lot of stupid
comments from great silly girls about
you know my face whatever and
I just may be really insecure fill up
time and I was about 14 probably when it
was moved worse and I just wish so much
makeup just kind of annoying because
when I first um joined the world tumblr
I absolutely hate saying that word out
loud that's when I was the most just not
happy with myself and I was in a very
bad situation in my life and that's why
it's very frustrating when people take
photographs of me from my tumblr from
when I was about 14 16 years ago and
they put it next to a photo every now
and they go make up it makes such a
difference I think that was me six years
ago and I had braces of one pair but bla
and I mean it's kind of funny that I've
had some people who are amazing enough
to have been following my journey from
these little tumblr days now because um
I honestly think like I don't really I
don't care anymore about what people um
their opinion about
Tumblr's I mean stuff uh-huh
someone because I think that this is
getting so deep
uh-huh so the I found that actually on
tumblr and everyone's and be really nice
things um was like the turning point in
my life you know people don't realize
how much things that they write to you
even or anonymous like nice things
mean when you're going through something
where like everyone is yelling and
screaming at you and calling you names
and my call me ugly and fat whatever and
then I come home and I log on to my
computer and I find all these messages
they're just like I just couldn't
believe they're written for me because
they were almost being so nice and ever
the first time so I call me pretty on
tumblr what the hell
yeah and I just thought that the whole
you know um message wasn't that for me
and I don't know like I saw it I find it
now that when people get weird about
lead with all this social media stuff
like I don't really care anymore but get
really embarrassed about it
um because other know why but people who
I know just not nice and they used to
just you know constantly um tease me
look for it and what I found this world
where people were appreciating me and
you know they really were interested in
my life I just you know I was just like
wow and I thought it was like the best
thing in the world so if you are
watching this and you have been um
following me for a long time then I
definitely love you you have made my
life very special so yeah just really
good that if they say yeah got really
deep but yeah so I just recorded lots of
things and I wasn't even recording so
what I was saying is that I was using my
concealer and my nude Burnett brush and
I just literally have just on a line
like that and it's amazing because it's
just like a little mini um surgery at
home which I love the idea of really
makes a difference when you were smiling
in photos or whatever make you ignore it
especially with the flash looks really
good like really straight
I just been using other translucent
powders but I've seen this one being
recommended a bit sorry I'm gonna give
it a go so I'm just
openness it's not doesn't have any color
I'm using my new by nature brush do you
guys ever have those girls in school who
were just like so orange that all over
the school uniform all clothes in
America
it was just like orange stains so bad
they ever went through the orange trays
in high school I know I sure did Oh fun
hello makeup textured my eyelashes are
currently non-existent so I'm going to
finally put on some mascara when I apply
my mascara I tend to blink and then I
just give it a wiggle yeah and that gets
a little bit I look like it's an albino
albino
I don't know I want like a little white
rabbit or something I just weird without
my without my own are you girl thing
well that one was going on so I don't
know I should really get them tinted or
something but I'm too lazy for that
we'll use a light powder and I'm using
facing straily again
use X call the pressed powder in beige
which I've nearly finished and I'm just
gonna brush the yeah so I'm just gonna
put this under my eyes sometimes when I
do read lips a lot people really like it
because simply because my theory is
because I have non-existent lips anyway
when people actually see them they're
like oh you look like a person again so
really is my favorite lipstick it's
called frou-frou sh t Armani which photo
is your money so now that my lips are
done I'm just going to do a little tiny
liner alright just following my bottom
lid
oh um I love that this look is very very
feminine obviously because I haven't
seen too many guys wearing the food I
was gonna be using a very little brush
to flag I'm just going to do
so I do about that much and then I just
get a smudgy brush I just going to blend
everything in I could run some eyelashes
but today I'm not really going anywhere
to important so I won't do that um okay
this is pretty much all so I hope that
you enjoyed watching do fine within two
hours because I'm not really used to
doing the whole camera stuff yet I cut
things weren't even for the nice
gentleman egg Disney so like Oh hot deal
haunted but um yeah so if you would
kindly let me know like what you would
want to see in the future so I have some
sort of idea that would be awesome that
would help me out a lot and yeah
hopefully see you guys soon that's
pretty fun
and thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
