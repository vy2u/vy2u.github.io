and welcome back to my old room I
thought I would film in this setup today
without my professional lighting or
anything like that because it's so like
a part - to my old eBay cheap brushes
video and today I thought it would be
perfect because you guys know that I
love my bargains and I literally put up
a photo on Instagram about an hour ago I
asked you if you guys wanted to see it
and I thought I probably have about two
people say yes but I had a lot of you
saying yes so here's the video today my
extensions I'm just sitting over there
because I just couldn't be bothered
putting them in today so that's why my
hair's like all over the place in this
video um today is a first impressions
full face on the Jessop brushes so I
have just applied some I decided I would
give this a go to see how they were
applying a full face of makeup so I
focused on mainly my eyes and my
contouring and powder so starting up
with the important part these brushes
cost me seventeen Australian dollars and
then five Australian dollars to ten so
they cost twenty two dollars in total
and can you tell that maths was my
strong point at school yeah right so
these brushes cost twenty two dollars in
total they are not for foundations and
then they don't work very well with
liquid products so they're more prepared
and stuff so just to give you a brief
description of each branch I have the
large powder brush which is absolutely
massive it's insane and then I have the
tapered face brush next is the powder
and a blush brush then we have the
tapered highlighter brush and the giro
fibre powder or blush
I can literally never say the word blush
brush blush brush and moving on to eyes
we have got the flat definer brush we
have the large fluffy brush the small
eyeliner brush and the tapered blending
brush we also have the small tapered
blending brush the concealer brush and
finally the blending brush so I did not
use all of the brushes today I did use
like 80% of the magus because there's
only so many powder brushes that you can
use in one makeup application so yeah I
am going to show you a full face first
impression using these brushes and then
the end I will give my honest review and
so we are now popping on our lovely
headband and I'm gonna get straight into
the brushes first impression now I have
applied my foundation my eyebrows and my
mascara because there were no foundation
brushes or eyebrow brushes so I thought
I would do that beforehand so I'm going
to be using the large concealer
concealer concealer brush with the
Rimmel wake me up concealer if I can get
the consumer
okay this brush is really really really
fluffy so it is really hard to blend out
because it's sticking to my skin and
once I'm blending it which is kind of
annoying because you'd want it want to
be like a slide but it's like sticking
to my face like this
alright so I'm just gonna pop on a
little bit more concealer just a much in
area I'm going in with the hoola Bruns
up by benefit I'm going to use the
powder blush brush with this one and
don't really know how much I should put
on the brush because I dunno ate it up
or if it's not gonna pack it on at all
but we'll see I think if that may have
been because I didn't put much product
on all right stead of the brush is
slightly almost like eating the product
away I'm putting quite a lot of runs on
my cheek on the brush but it's just not
transferring onto my skin because
yeah it looks good on camera though but
in person it just isn't building up
great I am going to contour my nose I'm
going to use this large fluffy brush for
my nose contour and I'm going to use the
same bronzer the hoola bronzer for my
contour because it's nice to make it
bird shadow match your cheekbone shadow
part of me and then slide it down my
nose this is not bad with some other
brushes I use for contouring it's so
annoying because I get it's like black
line down my nose but because this brush
is so fluffy it's good because it's not
making it like incredibly harsh I don't
know if you know what I mean but yeah
I'm now going to go and conceal my
bridge middle of mine hooks I love going
from like a really fat nose whose jack
nose in two seconds I love makeup I
really really really love makeup I'm
going to use the tapered highlighter
brush to pop this underneath my eyes I
know this is like the wrong brush to use
but it's the best one in the kit so
that's transferring the powder onto my
face really nicely and this brush is
really fluffy and like it glides on your
face which is great I think these
brushes I think the problem with these
brushes that they don't work well with
liquid products like my concealer worked
was like blur my concealer just was not
working with my concealer brush it's
almost like powders seem to work really
nicely but liquids and do not alright so
I'm very happy with the powder that's
this brush applied onto my face so big
thumbs up first one so now I'm going to
pop on some blush I'm using the NYX
blush in the shade or play so again this
brush is just not transferring the blush
to my face which is really annoying I
don't know about this one and today I'm
going to create quite like a warm
eyeshadow I think I'm just going to use
some of these peachy colors here and
then some of the orangey brown tones
yeah so firstly I'm going to use the
blending brush so the blending of the
blending brush is a bit weird it's all
like stripy don't really know how to
explain it but it just looks kind of
weird
I do really prefer this brush though to
the older Jess it ones which I've
reviewed because these ones are a lot
more professional I guess I'm now going
to use the short shader brush so I'm
just going to pack this on my eyelid and
it's not really coming up
gosh I don't know it's really a lot to
explain it's like you you can pack so
much on your brush like this and then
want to put it on your eye it just
disappears like it's I don't know it's
just not much that comes off there which
is kind of weird
to be H now I'm going to test out the
small tapered blending brush it's just
it's packed on a bit of color but it's
just not blending it out at all I'm
going to use the same blending brush
that I used at the beginning and I'm
just going to use this to try blend my
transition shade with that shade I just
put in my crease so now I'm going to use
the concealer brush well auto focus on
and I'm gonna pack this underneath my
eyebrow as a highlight and I have had so
much fallout just come out then which is
awesome now I'm going in with the short
shader brush for my lower lash line and
I'm just going to pop this underneath my
lash line this brush seems to be working
quite well especially for this
particular task because it's not
smudging the product out too much or
anything like that it's working quite
well sorry I've just finished my eyes I
will use the large planner brush which
is the largest powder brush in the whole
world it's almost the size of my head
and I'm gonna use this with my Australis
pressed powder I could not believe how
big this brush is it is in pain so I'm
just going to tuck this around my face
this brush is so big it's not really
doing anything oh yeah that was really
quite rubbish didn't really do anything
for me the last but not least we are
going to do the tapered highlighting
brush with the highlighting shade from
the AC on to a contour and highlight kit
I'm just going to see how it go so now
I'm just gonna go and give you my honest
review I really really really really
like the eye shadow brushes I mean for
the price you should really get them I
think so the retail price of eBay was
like 17 dollars the easy money so I just
yah when I was applying the eyeshadow I
was a bit unsure about it but now that
it's on and I'm looking at it I'm quite
happy and safe to say that it worked and
that's the main thing that really
matters is that it actually worked
and in other news I don't really like
the big pad of brushes I found they
didn't really do much for me but my
favorite one was the large fluff brush
really like how this looks for my nose
contour out of these I did not use the
dura fiber brush the powder blush brush
was awful I do not like this brush at
all that's going straight in the beam
the large powder brush did work but it
didn't pack on much product the tapered
highlighting brush did work you can see
that my highlighting my highlighter is
there so it did work I would recommend
if you are looking for some nice cheap
eye brushes to definitely purchase this
but in my honest opinion I didn't like
the big powder brushes because yeah
really annoying kind of disappointing
but what can you do and so my number one
we not is the large fluff brush this one
is definitely my favorite and the loser
is the powder blush brush this just yep
let's just say I'm not that much of a
man so that is all for me today guys I
hope that you enjoyed it and I hope that
you enjoyed that it was a little bit
more relaxed this video I'm just filming
in my bedroom I don't have my
professionals lights and setup and
everything and my camera is sitting on a
bin so I don't even a tripod but I just
felt like doing this video in a more
relaxed style because it's sort of like
a part true to my old eBay brushes video
so I wanted to have it like a similar
setting or whatever and it's just more
like a relaxed chilled videos so I do
hope that you enjoyed it let me know if
you enjoyed the cheaper review first
impressions videos because you guys know
that I love bargains ok yeah I really
hope you enjoyed and I hope that you
have a great week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
