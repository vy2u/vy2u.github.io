in today's video I am in my hotel room
in LA I decided to do sort of like a
brown smokey golden evening glam
shortest title ever makeup look I'm
heading out to a dinner event tonight so
I thought I would film I get ready with
me I feel like it has been way too long
so I come to get ready with me or makeup
tutorials this one is just a very casual
chitchat get ready with me and I really
hope you guys enjoy let's jump in front
so the headband is going on which means
it is time to get started
I'm going to use my little pink mare
today it's all really dirty and gross so
don't really come with that prepared
today I'm going to get started today by
using the toothpaste hangover primer
this is just to ensure that my skin is
nice and hydrated before we start and
then for foundation today I'm going to
use the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation this is in the shade sand so
now that's all rubbed in I'm going to
take my foundation and my a Beauty
Blender which I just tried to clean with
a bar soap so hopefully it's clean
enough and I'm actually gonna do this a
super lazy way and put a pump directly
onto my face this just makes it so I
don't get foundation like all over my
hands because we all know how nice it is
to have orange hands and everything that
you touch becomes orange in your leg a
my Dorito this Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation the shade sand I swear to God
is the perfect color match for bondo
sands dark tan match made in heaven I
swear to god cards it's so good well
this is an attractive look isn't it okay
so today we're gonna do things a little
bit different and actually start with
our eyes first because when it comes to
using dark colors you want to make sure
if you do make a mistake where there is
a lot of fallout which I probably will
be you want to make sure you haven't
done your powder yet because imagine
like a whole club of brown powder going
on your cheeks and you can't clean it
it's like oh my god I'm going to begin
with filling in my eyebrows and what I'm
going to use today is the anastasi
beverly hills dipbrow pomade this is in
the shade dark brown and I left the lid
open for too long and now it's
completely like a dried out of me so
please don't be dumb like me make this
mistake but this is the color of the tip
rather
I'm going to use so I'm basically just
going to start by filling in the outer
part of my brows and then I will work my
way into the front as well so now that
we're brows are filled I'm going to take
my Anastasia Beverly Hills brow gel just
to make sure that my brows stay in place
all day don't fly off anywhere into the
sunset so I'm just going to spread this
out throughout my brows we're going to
use the burnt orange mat by Anastasi at
Beverly Hills and we are placing it
right here as a transition shade or our
crease color I'm just going to go ahead
and place it here in my crease
I'm going to go ahead and take this
shade here which I believe is called
cognac not cognate hopefully that's
right what I'm going to aim to do is
place this right where my crease is and
the aim is for the transition color to
sit just above it and this to be just
below I'm just going to be adding this
slowly to my eyes and I'm not going to
put too much my brush at once because I
want to make sure I don't go too
overboard with it so just using a little
bit and then adding as I go so this is
always like the make-or-break moment
when we actually use a really dark color
this is an Anastasia Beverly Hills I
shadow in the shade fudge my aim is to
put this over my entire lid and have
this as a transition so this can either
go really well all the way I've been
punched in the eye but we will see how
we go and this is the part where you
gotta be super careful about fallout as
well I do find that with Anasazi shadows
I do not get a lot of Fallout but it's
better to be safe than sorry I'm just
making sure this is all evenly packing
onto my lid okay so this next step could
either be the best decision I've ever
made
or completely ruin it yesterday I picked
up some glitter and it's from a brand
called motives or clean motives and this
is how beautiful it looks this is gem
sparkles and citrine I believe it's
called so I'm just going to go ahead and
add a little bit of political ooh and
here goes nothing okay this is very
pretty
I like it this is cool this is
definitely gonna have fallout thank
goodness I'm doing my powder afterwards
I'm really feeling that glitter I'm very
glad that we did hat I'm going to go and
use the Too Faced better than sex
mascara and I'm just going to apply a
coat to my lashes with white bones
I'm going to be leaving my lower
lashline alone until we do concealer and
pattern everything so it will all come
together after we do the powder for
lashes i'm using the dani beauty store
ice wife flirt lashes these are
ridiculously beautiful these lashes can
work with natural makeup looks or more
dramatic ones like this they're so
versatile I love the flirt ones so much
I'm going to get them as close to my
lash line as possible so now I'm going
to go ahead and use some concealer I'm
using the bare minerals of bare skin
concealer and this is in the shade fair
there's quite a story fun because you
actually get to clean up the lines from
your eye shadow and make it like more
professional I'm just following the line
from my lower lash line and I'm just
cleaning up all the eye shadow on the
fall out from there
and now for setting up my face makeup
I'm going to be using my Mac Studio Fix
this is in the shade c3o and I'm using a
real techniques brush to apply onto my
face so let's talk about la sharp if oh
my god look at the mascara of large in
my hand
whoops oh la I am here for business
meetings I'm also going to many and
Patricks one-million party which by the
time this is up I probably have already
been to improbably put up photos from
which is going to start citing hello me
in the future how are you and it's been
so fun like I really love LA I love the
States I really want to come back one
day and do a proper road trip around the
u.s. because I feel like this place
there's so much to offer so much to see
and now that I'm 21 I can actually go
and drink here and everything which is
like yes but I just feel like the city
is so exciting and there's just so much
going on here it's such a cool place to
be and ah I love it and then I'm going
to New York really soon as well which is
like amazing and then I'm going
somewhere else and mate
lots of travelling happening lately for
my cheeks today I'm going to be using
the Anastasia Beverly Hills contour kit
and I'm using this brown shade here I
used to go so overboard with this
contour oh my goodness I was like Who am
I so I've come to LA alone this time and
that's completely fine like I love
traveling alone so even though there's
some points where I'm like okay I really
miss my dog right now traveling alone
it's something which like I feel you
have to get used to and then once you're
used to it it's just not even that bad
at all now I'm going to go ahead the
yellow shade and I'm going to place this
underneath mass this will just hide all
my lovely veins that love to pop out
around there how good is the arm
production value of this video today
nice background hey that is done let's
move on to my long-lost little baby this
is the Mac of gold deposit in my
everyday makeup store you guys are like
how come you don't use that anymore but
rediscovered it rediscovered my love for
it so we're going to add a little bit to
our cheekbones as well now we're taking
good old mary-lou manizer by the balm
I'm going to add this highlight to my
cheekbones down my nose and probably a
little bit need my eyebrows well because
I'm why not
I'm going to spray this bad boy all over
my face this is the own decay all
nighter makeup setting spray - gone
orange because um foundation thing is
young I'm just gonna go like an X
formation and then like a cross
formation it's a bit weird but you'll
see what I mean
look I'll never get used to this feeling
it's like I don't even know what that
noise is supposed to be is it a baby
crying who knows now I'm going to zoom
you guys in very close and personal Hey
and let's do our under eyes taking the
shade cognac not clogged neck I'm going
to be placing this underneath my eyes
with this pencil eye shadow brush and
this is normal part rice stuff up so
fingers crossed we do not stuff this up
to add
I'm going to go ahead with that glitter
glue from before as well and put a
little bit of sparkle on my lower lash
line too now I'm going to go ahead and
apply some roller lash to my bottom
lashes and it's super annoying because I
forgot to bring black eyeliner to the LA
to the LA to LA so I'm just going to try
using a black eyeshadow instead can't
believe I forgot to bring eyeliner well
it's kind of working I guess and now I'm
going to finish up to date by giving
myself some lips so I think I'm going to
go with a nude lip option I think that
would suit this best I'm going to use
the saw lip liner by Mac let's make them
bigger
for my lipstick I'm going to use velvet
teddy by Mac bringing back all my old
golden oldies in today's video this is
like the only makeup that I pack with me
so I pack my favorites so I'm sure you
recognize a lot of the products that I'm
using in this video I can't do that
stick and talk at the same time
thank you guys so much for watching this
get ready with me please let me know if
you enjoyed it and I'll chat with you
guys in the comments bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
