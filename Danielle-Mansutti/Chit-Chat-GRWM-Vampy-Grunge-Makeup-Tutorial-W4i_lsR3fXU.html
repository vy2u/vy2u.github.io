in today's video I decided do something
very different it is very edgy it's dark
it's vampy I just wanted to have fun
with makeup today and I'm really happy
with the way it turned out I really hope
you guys enjoy this tutorial and lift up
it would know everyone I've just had the
first impression for a foundation so the
first step that we're going to do
strength is concealer I'm going to use
the Rimmel wake me up concealer as you
can see I'm getting quite low you go get
some more but I'm using the Rimmel wake
me up concealer underneath my eyes to
start with write myself up a little bit
it's 8:00 in the morning I need to wake
up I'm doing a grunge vampy look at 8 in
the morning it feels so nice to be
filming again though as you guys know
I've been traveling all over the place
recently I went from LA I went home for
like three days when I went back to New
York and then I was talking for another
like three days and then I went to the
mall teeps
Josh you sit down in my bedroom and film
again it's been so long I'm so happy to
be back and filming normal videos once
again because I missed it so much so if
you guys do have any requests for
requests I could never say no but
requests for any videos you want me to
film and please let me know because I'm
on a filming spree once again now that
I'm home and I've stopped traveling
around so much for now who knows what
we're going to be traveling again like
really you know how it is I love hearing
what you guys want to see so yeah back
to the makeup tutorial sir but powder
stay I'm using the nose pressed powder
not in Beach oh my god oh my god it's
another pressed powder in desert I
always thought it was desert it is
desert this is a slightly hello camera
can we focus thank you so much this is a
slightly Pinker redder warmer torrent
powder wow I really haven't filmed it a
long time yeah this is a little bit
warmer which is good because I try to
need
10 this is the center of a fake tan it
is slightly warmer than bondo sands so I
figured I would use this powder today
instead I'm using a real techniques
brush I wish I could tell you what it is
but it doesn't actually say powders on
it's time for brows I'm using V Anastasi
pepper hills dipbrow in the shade dark
brown I knew that one layer to look I
was weird yes I'm going to use this on
my brows using as always my makeup geek
Gio brow brush what's really weird is it
when I was away in the Maldives when I
got home a lot of people in person said
to me all your life I look really
different did you like that something in
a month no I feel like maybe I'll be so
order and the chlorine and all that kind
of made my eyebrows that lighter maybe
fade in my feather brow which is super
sad times that browser done I'm going to
move on to eyes I'm going to use the Kat
Von D shade + light eye palette I
actually have not used this before but I
think it it's so beautiful I really want
to use it and it's all in that so I'm
going to flick a vampy look today so I'm
thinking I'm going to use these two
shades here but firstly let's just focus
on our crease I'm assuming these are
super pigmented some-something's this
light brown at the very end first just
to see what the pigmentation is like
because if we use a dark one for my
transition I could be like whoa well
it's a very warm pretty shade I like it
you may know disguise this lovely mark
on my finger please don't be too grossed
out about it
basically if you've watched my Molly's
vlogs you would have seen when I was on
that watersports thing on that little
inflatable thing it's kinda like banana
boat but it was like a doughnut kind of
thing and I was gripping so hard on to
it that I ripped all the skin off my
finger I was holding a gopher on the
other hand so multitasking
in the vlog when I'm in the little like
inflatable and I'm like oh this is so
much fun my finger is getting completely
burnt off gotta say though Kat Von D's
makeup products are such high-quality
aren't they now so pigmented and so
lovely okay crease is now done I'm
feeling and I'm feeling like doing
winged eyeliner today but I'm just
thinking what should I do it to my lid
might sort of mix these two colors here
and play around them on my outer corner
the eye to see what look we achieve my
brother is watching Game of Thrones in
the room behind me right now and I can
hear smiles makes sure now you guys are
nice and personal you can see it is just
like a very subtle smoked out look I
don't want go to ofwhat because I will
be doing winged eyeliner and stuff like
that but I am just going to use one of
the light shades from the palette and
I'm going to use it underneath my
eyebrows and now it's time for my least
favorite thing ever to fill in makeup
styles which is Griner I'm going to use
this Too Faced I'm that kind of girl
sketch market eyeliner today on my eyes
the worst bit is over it's time for
mascara I'm using the bare minerals lash
domination mascara today
I'm going to leave my lashes for now
because I'm going to finish them off in
a minute I'm going to do my contouring
and stuff first before I do my lower
lashes and for my lashes today I'm using
the I spy lashes in Luna which I feel
are the most perfect lashes for this
look because they give you that cat eye
look they're going to be absolutely
perfect for winged eyeliner now time for
my favorite part which is contouring I
love this because I get so sculpted
right now it's good I'm going to use the
lorac Pro palette which I've been
holding for like the last five minutes
and I'm going to use a mixture of these
two shades here and then I'm going to
use the yellow highlight shade here in
the middle underneath my eyes and I'm
doing quite a deep contour today because
I feel like with this fabulous it is
very edgy and it's different it's dark I
just feel like why not go all out on the
contour I'm also following it up to my
temples or my forehead so even though
this look is primarily matte I still
want to put on a little bit of highlight
I'm using the mary lou manizer by the
balm highlighter because i just feel
like it's missing something so on a
little bit of highlight with this fan
brush this is a rose garden Zoe the 1 to
9 luxe fan brush
I'm going to run it down my nose as well
now for underneath my eyes I'm going to
take this warm shape here once again I'm
going to be using it with a pencil brush
I don't have a clean one-owner
we're going to run it on my lower lash
line
I'm using this black eyeliner which is
by I of Horus and I'm going to use it to
line my waterline and sort of make this
a little bit more dark and dramatic and
smoky and then with the same mascara
from before I'm going to use this on my
lower lashes and now the star of the
show to bring all this look together
this is the Anastasia Beverly Hills
liquid lipstick this is in midnight and
is black it is just black as black envy
and it's long lasting with one lipstick
it's going to make this look complete
thank you guys so much for watching
today I appreciate it so much and if you
do recreate this look please tag me on
Instagram so I can find you and give you
some love and that's all for me today
guys I love you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
