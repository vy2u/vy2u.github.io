today we are baking my crap Christmas
cupcakes I had such high hopes for these
cupcakes but um yeah I'm moving in and
guys doing a break I really wanted to
try baking video and I thought it'd be
amazing to do a Christmas one because
it'd be so much fun it's perfect time to
do it and everything I'm like I'm gonna
wing it but we have these beautiful
designs you guys to try I really hope
you guys enjoy this video it's not
serious it's just a bit of fun and let's
jump straight into it
so here's everything that you're gonna
need for the cupcakes today I'm gonna
keep it really simple the most basic
vanilla cupcake recipe of all time first
of all we have got two lots of cupcake
holders I think the word is like a
bright shimmer but it's good and then we
have some scales which we are going to
need throughout the whole process just
to make sure we have the right
measurements this is totally your choice
I do have some candy canes so I thought
it might look really cute as well but
we'll see let's see how that goes
also we have got some salt reduced
butter for the whole baking process
we'll need is full of cupcakes and also
for the buttercream icing at the end we
have some silver cat coals I don't know
the word is but I think it's a tough
choice I don't know there's silver sugar
balls so I don't know you are going to
need some milk also we have six free
arranged eggs
thank you yes free-range we have some
red and lime green gel food coloring so
hopefully that will work just as well
you'll need some vanilla extract as well
we have our sugar flour don't know what
this one is icing sugar if you prefer to
just use a handheld mixer that's fine I
normally do just this video I want to
look super cool so I'm using a really
like professional mixer which I'm really
not used to it also might be a disaster
this is all you'll need it looks like a
lot but once we actually get started it
will be fun the first step is to
preheat the oven to 180 Celsius which
I've done and now it is incredibly noisy
I'm sorry about that so for the first
step we're gonna need 200 grams of
butter we also need 370 grams of sugar
and we need our vanilla essence and
we're gonna cream of those three
together we don't reuse hard butter
because this is going to be not good and
also just so you know I will leave all
the conversions for the American the
measurements in the description just so
that there's no confusion but I'm gonna
do this in grams because that's how I
understand it all there I'm gonna make
sure that I have 200 grams and I hate
butter so I hate touching it and then
I'm also going to cut it into smaller
cubes but you take it off first and I'm
gonna put it into small cubes just to
insure that it's gonna mix better as
well
so now I let us in these little chunks
I'm going to add them straight into my
mixer next we're gonna add 370 grams of
sugar into Vitamix a lot of sugar love
it okay let's go Oh 370 grams come on
this isn't even gonna fit in my little
bowl I'm on it that's bang on 370 grams
I think I'm gonna need to even to clean
up before my next scene I'm gonna add
one teaspoon of vanilla extract as well
and the next step is to cream everything
together so I'm just going to do that
with a man mixer and I'm gonna start on
a low setting and then just go higher
and higher until it's got the right
consistency
so once your mixture is all being
crimped together what we're gonna do is
add eggs one at a time instead of
throwing them all in there at the same
time as the mix is still going if you
have a handheld mixer then it makes
sense to stop and then do it but I'm
just going to do it as it's still going
just as the mix all combines really well
on everything I'm gonna get this to kick
going crack an egg put the shell in
there and then so on so I'm gonna put
this back on a lower setting for the
next part we're gonna need 405 grams of
self-raising flour that is 200 grams
sitting in there I'm just going to sink
this into my mixture of the birds and
then I'm gonna grab the other half but
if you have a big mixing bowl I mean big
scales because you're smart then just do
it all the one go going to bang it on my
hand like this and just make sure it's
all aired out and lovely yeah just some
moisture in the mixture a little bit
more I'm gonna add a little bit of the
milk and then I'm gonna add more after
I've mixed it together just so that if a
powder doesn't explode everywhere when
you have flour just be careful because
like I said it can and it probably will
go everywhere so don't stress and now as
it's joining I'm gonna put the remaining
product in them
ever since have the speed of it
so once your cupcake mixture is all
mixed together my favorite part of the
whole process is looking the spoon
afterwards we're going to put it all
evenly into our little party cake
cupcake holder things and then all the
remaining stuff we can lick from spoon
so now I have used my red and green
cupcake holders and I've distributed
them as so because it's Christmas and I
mean perfect colors for Christmas and
we're going to actually spoon it into
the holder but the thing is is that you
don't want to do it too much because
cupcakes
gosu be in the oven so I'm gonna aim to
do it around like the halfway mark so
I'm gonna do this mixture is I'm just
going to grab a spoonful like so and
then if I can balance this I'll grab it
and I'm just going to come home I'm
gonna add it to my corner
for now I'm just going to add a little
bit because it's better to start with a
little bit and add to it and have too
much now to take it away so I'm just
going to add the same amount to the rest
and if there's remaining mixture
I'll just distribute distribute that
through out the whole cupcake situation
so now we have got a lovely little
cupcake mix looking very cute it's time
to put these in the oven for 15 to 20
minutes and remember it's at 180 Celsius
so keep an eye on them I don't know if
you any of you guys watch bake-off but
be like that constantly watching your
little oven because we don't want any
black cupcakes today and then it's gonna
be my favorite time on the whole thing
time to lick this food
now I've just taken my cupcakes out of
the oven and you can see that there's
two very different styles you have
volcanoes and then we have flat cupcakes
and the basic reason as to why this
happened is because if you leave your
cupcakes at the bottom of your oven they
tend to be a lot flatter but take a lot
longer to bake and then if you leave
them at the top they reach towards the
sky and they're gonna really feel like
volcanoes
little bit more like muffins so just so
you know depending on what kind of style
you want your cupcakes to look like
that's what you do it's so important to
make sure that your cupcakes are
completely chilled out before you apply
the buttercream icing onto them which
we're going to create now what we're
going to need is 300 grams of icing
sugar and it seems like a lot but a lot
of it just disappears into thin air
literally I've also got 170 grams of the
same butter that we used before I've got
a hundred mils of milk we'll be adding
it as we go but that's just to be safe
but I might use more might use less well
definitely let you guys know so the
first thing that we're going to do is
grab the butter and we're going to put
this into our mix and you got to make
sure that your butter is really soft as
well and then after that I'm going to
start sifting my icing sugar and I'm
just gonna add a tiny splash of milk as
well so what I'm gonna do just to make
sure that there isn't a crazy explosion
is I'm going to add a guard to my mix no
one does click down make sure the open
bit is facing the back like that it's
not gonna go everywhere and we're gonna
start this on a low speed and then
gradually go higher and it does actually
need a long time to mix so I'm gonna
start off giving it two minutes and then
I'll see if it needs any more but I
might leave it even for five minutes but
we'll see how we go so I just had this
mixing for about two minutes or so and
you can see how thick is just clinging
on to the mixer it needs more milk as
well then I'm using a spatula again and
just making sure that we get all the
remaining mixture from the sides and put
it back in and when it comes to this
stuff you should know kind of like what
icing should look like anyway so just
kind of go with your own employ I don't
have to follow my instructions or
anything if you think it looks wrong and
add whatever you feel
we'll make it look right so now your mix
should be you're looking at something
like this the paler it is the better
path down the middle and add half to
another Bowl I'm gonna use a food
coloring and this one to make it green
and I'm also knees one in that one to
make it red I feel like this icing will
probably cover one batch of the cupcakes
and for the other batch we might do it
in a different way to show you guys that
there's lots of different ways that you
can do it anyway now I have to lots of
the buttercream icing I have some food
gel coloring which I haven't used before
so we'll see how this guy's
so as you can see it's pink
and I'm not an advanced little bakers
home I would recommend getting the
liquid food dye because I use the whole
pipe of this but it's still pink no now
we have a very green icing and we have a
let's just call it red so now for the
super fun part which is piping so it's
do piping I industries a disposable bag
like this one here and I'm using a star
nozzle today for the cupcakes see where
the nose is gonna land in the bag and
then make a snippy snip snip cut now I'm
gonna be completely honest with you guys
I am piping for the first time ever
right now I've been watching tutorials
for so long how to do it but we're gonna
wing it I mean why not so I'm going to
fold the disposable bag inside out to
make it easy to actually put the icing
in because if I put it in like this
would just be trapped all that size so
now that the Ute bag is inside out I'm
going to scoop up a bit of this icing
and try and put it's like halfway on one
side and then the green icing half but
on the other side and I'm just pushing
it down to make sure as you can see
there's a little bit of a mix going on
inside the bag okay so now my icing bag
is looking a bit like a marbled icecream
it's looking a bit crazy but I'm sure
it'll be fine so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna start from the farthest away
cupcakes from me and that way I'm not
gonna be messing up the hunt at the
front or anything like that and I'm just
gonna squeeze from the bottom and I'm
gonna squeeze out and then
around so now it's time to improvise my
cupcakes are not looking very
Christmassy so what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to grab a random one like
this one looks a bit like a poo outside
this designer icing in white another
doctor out here okay
I'm not too sure I have another one of
those it comes with the nozzle as well
and I'm going to just pop this on my
cupcake like that and my goal is to kind
of make that look like a Santa hat so
that's what we're trying to do they kind
of look like boobs let's just pretend
that um this Santa hats so now for my
crap cupcakes I'm going to add a little
bit of snow bit of sparkle because I
mean it can't really get much worse
candy
so for the volcano cupcakes right now
I'm going to use some ready to roll
red icing so just to show you that's two
different styles to make really crap
cupcake service once your big solid
she's been laid out what we're gonna do
is just grab one of your little volcano
cupcakes from before I'm literally just
going to cut out just a tiny little
section like this and then we're gonna
make it look kind of like a Christmas
pudding so kind of like a little melted
thing on the top of it and then once
it's covering the majority of the
cupcake we're gonna take a little candy
cane like so and we are just going to
dip it in like this now taking some of
these giant white stars and I'm going to
add it to a cupcake as well we're going
to use the silver cut all wrong sort of
it like old from before and just stop
them around the cupcake just to make it
look a little bit so thank you guys for
sitting through my crap Christmas
cupcakes of 2015 I know this video is so
different from our normal videos and
it's a little bit of a disaster but I
thought I would just put it up you guys
anyway because you know it's a bit of
fun why not we can't all be perfect
little bakers and everything if any of
you even try to recreate these I'm sure
they look so much better than mine
anyway so I think the last thing that I
have to do is to try them so let's give
them a taste
hopefully health pays better than they
look as well mmm
now really good please let me know if
you guys enjoyed this kind of baking
video even though it was a disaster I'd
love to practice more and do more kind
of fun things like this so I hope you
guys enjoyed it and have a great
Christmas bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
