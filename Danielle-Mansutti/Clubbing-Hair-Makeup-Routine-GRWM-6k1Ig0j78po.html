in today's video I have my clubbing
routine which is a get ready with me
style video here is a little before and
after of what you're going to see today
I'm going to show you everything from my
washing hair process to makeup and
everything in between so I am still
using a salon I am so obsessed with this
I showed you guys a little while ago and
I do have 50% off any of the products or
three products for $15 if you use the
link in my fire which is a sound calm
for its lash daddy so this beautiful
product is the color safe volumizing
shampoo I've been using this for quite a
few months now and I've gone through so
many bottles I will leave some
information on the screen about the
shampoo for the really in-depth things
about what's in it and what makes it
amazing and yes I am wearing a bikini in
the shower don't worry don't worry
remember to click my link in the video
description below to get 50% off as well
and this shampoo makes my hair so thick
and so healthy I just can't even
describe how much I love it and now the
next step is using the color safe
volumizing conditioner I swear nothing
makes my hair silky and shinier it is
sorry good and it is formulated with
body boosting proteins for softly
enhanced effect and final limp hair
without weighing your hair down at all
just like the shampoo as well it has the
Vives your technology the vegetable
protein the pro vitamin b5 and the body
boosting polymer which all help to make
your hair look amazing now only once a
week I use the leave-in conditioner as
well I don't overuse this because it is
quite a intense product the leave-in
conditioner will combat your frizz and
flyaways which is so good it hydrates
your hair and protects your hair color
as well and it is great for all hair
types and as you can see I'm avoiding
putting it around my roots I'm just
using it in my ends because that's where
I need the conditioner to work the best
for me and the fourth and final step to
get the most amazing hair when you go
clubbing is the renewing treatment oil I
literally can't live without this
product I always take it when I go
overseas it is the best treatment oil
I've ever used it protects your hair
from heat styling it's good for all hair
type it helps to tame frizzy hair for
sleekness and it has hydrating shield
which prevents your color from
eating it's absolutely amazing and it is
seriously my little secret weapon it's
so good I am way too lazy to blow dry my
hair properly so I just dry it like this
and look at how shiny it is from those
products I love it
I actually flip my hair upside down and
dry it this way for the best volume I
feel like it really does work for me so
as you can see I'm doing my dramatic
hair flip and will volume and now it is
time for make out so I'm applying the
Minnie Mouse headband as always to hide
those little baby hairs I'm starting
with the two-faced hangover primer today
I'm gonna rub this into my face and then
I'm going to use the Too Faced Born This
Way Foundation in the shade sand it has
no flashback which is perfect for
clubbing and it lasts all through your
sweaty messy dancing as well I promise
I've tried it many times and it does
truly work so it was right about this
point in time I noticed how white my
hands were compared to my foundation
self like damn girl so I did to have my
hands after this don't worry so I'm just
going to apply this over my face the
foundation is meant to match my neck and
not my face because I do fake tan then
with my eyebrows I'm using the dark
brown dip brow pomade by anastasia
beverly hills and just filling in my
brows very very very quickly a few guys
using the Kat Von D shade + light eye
palette I'm going to use a really warm
red shade with a very very very light
amount first I'm just using this on my
crease and I'm actually gonna put up my
lid as well just all over cuz it's such
a beautiful shade as you can see blender
blend fast forward so just blending and
blending and blending and then I applied
a whole chunk more so I went in with a
light hand first and then secondly went
in with a deeper I guess you could say
he just applied more product onto my lid
and then I just kept doing this over and
over and over again until I had the
exact red shade that I desired so once
it was really really really red like
this I used the lighter shade in the
palette to sort of make a highlight
underneath my eyebrow and then I use
this gorgeous gold eyeshadow from
Africa's medics on my lid this glitter
is by a brand called motives I believe
it's called
the citrine and then I'm just applying
the UH what's called glitter glue that's
it I'm going to get the glitter glue and
then applying the glitter on top wow I
really just like stumbled over my worth
as you can see applying glitter the more
glitter the better just go crazy
and then of course applying some Skaro
so firstly I'm just quickly curling my
lashes and then applying a little coat
of mascara before I apply my falsies I'm
so excited I'm about to show you guys my
new iSpy lashes packaging for the first
time ever I'm so excited
tada KCU packaging I hope you guys love
it and wild it's a brand new style by
iSpy it will be live very soon I'm
thinking around about the beginning of
September and this style is gorgeous I'm
in love with it it's like a mixture of
Admira and flirt and oh my god I am
obsessed I love it guys so I did a
little before and after so you could see
how the lashes truly looked I'm so
obsessed Anna can't wait you guys the
editors all sorry I'm using the Born
This Way concealer the lighter shade I
think it's just called light I'm not too
sure I'm just going to clean up that eye
shadow line there I'm just like
obsessing over these lashes still I'm so
in love with them I can't can't can't
light so you guys can get them and I
hope you guys love the new packaging I
love it too and back to the makeup I'm
using the Too Faced cocoa contour
palette to apply my contour and then
using the Too Faced sun body bronzer
which I am obsessed with right now I'm
going to apply this generously to my
cheeks my temples my forehead a little
bit under my chin you know the drill
just bronze it up for clubbing
I'm also applying some that contour down
my nose I'm just using the brush that
came in the contour kit it's beautiful I
love the brush then using the yellow
shade underneath my eyes to sort of give
myself a little bit extra coverage as
well now going in with that red shade
once again I'm now applying it to my
under eye area just very gently just
underneath the eye to sort of blend the
whole eye look together
and then I'm applying the better than
sex mascara once again to my bottom
lashes this time this mascara is my
favorite mascara ball time as I'm sure
you all know very well it's so good I
love it makes such a huge difference to
my bottom lashes as well now is in the
color pop eco-park which you guys know I
have been using religiously lately I'm
obsessed with it I'm applying this on my
lips because when I go clubbing this is
the are only lipstick that lasts all
night that I've found recently so I'm
loving Echo Park Echo Park not a good
part
what tani wash then I'm using the mary
lou manizer highlighter on my cheeks
also a little bit down my nose and all
that good stuff you know how it is now
time to sort up my hair so this is how
my hair dries and naturally as you can
see it's got a little bit of a kink and
it's a bit nut so I'm just going to put
it in the middle parting as always and
then first of all I'm going to tease my
hair a little bit to create a bit of
volume because my hair is quite flat
once I wash it and then after this I'm
just gonna use my GHD only on my front
strand so I only straighten the front
part of my hair I guess they aren't
really bangs but you know what I mean
and that was the finished look I really
hope you guys enjoyed it and don't
