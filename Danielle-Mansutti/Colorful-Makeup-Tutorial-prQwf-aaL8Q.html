hey guys welcome back to my channel in
south korea I've been inspired by a
sunset to create something colorful and
beautiful just like it so we have our
yellows oranges are pink and I'm loving
all the color and the craziness in this
looks I hope you guys enjoyed our
shadows birthday I had the best time
well so many really colorful look see
and if you are not yet Tyler family the
subscribe button is right below be
amazing if you subscribe to my channel I
set up two new videos every single week
so without further ado let's get into it
I don't know why I don't know how but
all my eyelid primers have seemed to
disappear on me so we're just
improvising with this NYX jumbo pencil
in milk and then I'm using the white
shade from the morphe 35o palette on my
eyes over the top and I'll be using a
35-year palette for all the colors today
now using this gorgeous yellow shade I'm
using it on a sigma tapered blending e35
brush and we're going to blend this in
the whole windscreen wiper circular
motion all the way up to very close to
our eyebrow bone a masters I look to be
extremely blended and like a really
lovely gradient so it's great to blend
this a little bit more than usually
would
adding to the sunrise uses gorgeous
burnt orange a with a morphe m4 33 brush
I'm actually applying a really light
pressure onto my crease because I don't
want it to be too overwhelming so I'm
starting with a very light hand and
building it up as I go in little
circular motions but not going as far up
as the yellow shade and I'm using this
pink shade but I'm going to use my
finger to apply it first that we can
pack on as much as we possibly can and
I'm going to go in with a brush and
blend it all together now I've lost a
bit of orange along the way so it's
going to add a little bit more into my
crease using the same brush that I used
before and again just using the whole
circle motion we all know we've all been
there we've all done it five million
times learn learn learn learn blend and
a bit more blending and then I'm adding
the yellow again with my big fluffy
brush and adding this back to where it's
all sort of faded away for my lower lash
line I'm actually doing this in the
opposite way of my top so I'm starting
with the pink shade first on a pencil
brush then I'm growing a small tapered
f45 blending brush with the orange and
then you guessed it next and using the
yellow so I like to do it the opposite
way to speak here just means I don't
have to go back in like I did with the
top lid and keep adding more this is the
way I like to do the bottom and then I'm
going to blend it until I'm happy with
it
I feel like it has been fun tantalizes I
applied eyeliner on camera so I thought
it is about time
I'm intimate art to clay pot in black
with a winged liner brush and I was so
nervous filming this because I felt
forgotten how to do eyeliner but this
was a really good product to use I
really really really liked it was
actually the first time I used this
Tarte eyeliner and I was very impressed
that I'm within the Too Faced better
than sex mascara on my lashes to prepare
them for my falsies and for my faulty
stay and the Madonna beauty store eyes
by lashes in famous which are these big
bold lashes and I love them and just
like that we have the finished look
and thank you guys so much for watching
today's tutorial I hope you loved it as
much they loved filming it for you and
if you do decide to recreate this and
tag me at density on Instagram I would
love to see your creations so until next
time guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
