pick up my camera and film right now as
you can see I'm not exactly dressed in
filming mode right now but I am
decluttering and sorting out when I have
sales thought it might be something that
you guys want to see welcome to the room
which when people come over I normally
like lock away because it's actually
like awful huh messy and this is about
yeah welcome to my mess this is a room
that I used to film in a sleep and they
just mean everything was kind of really
possible I have lots of things to sort
out I have so much makeup in terms of
like figuring out what makeup I use for
giveaways what makeup that I use for
doing to women shelters stuff like that
I literally have like so much stuff
hiding away every single plastic bag has
like hips and makeup and as well so
today I was thinking I am just going to
go ahead and declutter organize you know
what's going where and all that kind of
stuff and today is a Saturday I've done
all the things I need to do today so far
so I thought I might as well tackle the
be stupid this has been sitting here for
like months and months and months means
being sought out for one over to England
again yes as you guys know I've
everything that unfortunately means I
can't take every single makeup line that
I own so I really have to narrow it down
to what I will use and what I love
what's been eating so as you guys know I
normally store all my makeup in my
drawers on my desk I've already like
checking out some things to put them in
this room and everything so we're going
to go through that all and I'm going to
put things into piles ok so getting this
show on the road don't even know so I'm
going to section things into donating to
charity women shelters and etc then I'm
going to do a giveaway pile as well and
then I'm also going to a third part of
things to throw out that have been used
and aren't exactly the most clean things
to donate to someone and I just realized
a bit like a redtail hi
so what can I see first first I have
these
hello I have these urban decay setting
sprays now these are so good
I do already have and use some of these
and these are all used for different
purposes and stuff like that so these
are all such good growth products that I
think we're going to have the first
items in the giveaway park because these
are really really good things that I'm
sure you guys would love to get your
hands on these clean or swishing
australia getting your hands on setting
spray it's just so hard even more hydra
charged complexion is priming spray and
a vitamin infused complexion prep primer
spray so they're going to give what how
to and then also all these match box
photo finish primer i've already taken
out the primers that suit me or i want
to you so giveaway pile and i think that
even more here as well so we've got more
and we've also got primer water as well
now you have much attack skincare i am
going to give away the two that
definitely have not been opened I saw
the chart labels and this one I think
probably has been pumped once ever so I
will donate this to the women shelter
she's so like wants to be involved in
this BSA don't you say no he has very
big color pop highlighted trios I think
giveaway pile for these because they are
unopened on you so I have this lipstick
holder which has like five million
Brazilians to lipstick in it I think I'm
going to donate every single one of
these to the women shelter or to charity
because it's been not in their original
packaging I find it a bit things I find
it's a bit strange to be giving away to
a subscriber so I think everything here
has all been open not all that's being
used obviously and we check which ones
have been having the news but it's going
to be donating organs lipsticks - thanks
mate you've got Charlotte Tilbury and
decay Mac nas tart and color pox so
that's really really really good
donation best thing in the world is
seeing how much these women appreciate
it as well and it makes me so incredibly
happy
they truly deserve it you know it
doesn't deserve to be sitting in my
apartment never been used
like I just more than happy to give this
away to those that need it more and just
to give you a closer look I'm also going
to actually give one slip towards
charity as well but yes we have like
chout Tilbury NOS max hell pop top and
then a whole bunch of decay lilies as
well so these are all going to go to the
women's shelter okay so next um I'm
going right for this massive massive bag
of makeup as well and just to say no no
we comment about this anyway I want
everyone to know that I do appreciate
absolutely everything that I get sent I
appreciate it so much and it's just
unbelievable overwhelming just so
generous and so kind but I am someone
whose values represent if someone needs
it more than me I'd rather they have it
so that's what that's what we're doing
like it looks like I'm giving away
everything and I said much em like this
is a collection of everything from my
drawers that I took out and I didn't
film like the taking out of my drawers
bit this video would have been like five
hours long we're just floating out and
decluttering us I did just declaring
that of my drawers like three months ago
so she's been sitting here like oh no so
we have a color pop duo which I'm going
to put in a giveaway pile because it is
in its packaging then we have these two
foundations by bare minerals which I'm
going to put in the charity pile because
when it comes to giving away you don't
know people in Tony's but if I give it
to charity than the women can pick and
choose what suits them which you know
match my heaven my thing does to sit
like right right here just right here
why not I have some Too Faced melted
mats these are going to go in the
giveaway
okay we have a big box stuff all right
this is amazing I'm actually want to get
this low for a long time this is like to
lots of the two-faced boy away
concealers which you know I'm so good so
I'm going to give away pal this one I
obviously can't give away or anything
it's missing the top and it's being used
so unfortunately this bad boy
it's got 1/2 the pin well so many
lipsticks these are all wet and wild
lipsticks and I'm going to be charitable
and we have some stuff like space masks
more nog stuff like actually I think
this whole entire box is going to go to
church because it's all unopened so
maybe we'll make it easier and just put
it all on bar oh my god
oh yeah so much makeup of this bag
the Anastasi belly hills brow pro
palette which i'd use maybe like twice
sorry I'm going to have to put this in
the cherry pile and then have nos
Olympia Charge Card and I have oh my god
let me just take you off the stand and
show you this probably look either I
have so much stuff in here which is just
safe now
all of it is unopened I believe maybe so
it's been used once like has this been
used at all a bronzer no that's not Ben
you still got a little brush so I can
put that in our little giveaway pile
we've got going on over here
but oh my goodness everything in here
looks like it may have been used we have
tarte pro quo it's really dirty I would
want to give it away it's not in good
condition so hmm I feel like this might
be worthwhile going in the charity
section because I just don't want to
risk giving away two products I have
come to the conclusion that everything
in there is just going to go to charity
make it easier because it's all face
makeup so we've got a bunch of two-faced
bonus ways Urban Decay all nighter which
is my favourite foundation of all time
as you can see this is a little bit too
light for me we have Tarte Amazonian
clay Kat Von D like a bunch of really
really really nice high-end makeup and
like every single color ever
heart-shaped tapes open stuff like
literally my favorite brands my favorite
products but the wrong shades for me so
I'm going to
a beautiful woman who definitely will
deserve this a lot more than it just
sitting in my drawers nothing else be
used because it is a completely
different color than my face the whole
bag is full of stuff lots and lots of
stuff they have lots of like melts Matt
listen going on giveaway poll so much
stuff oh my goodness every year in a
package unopened I'm going to put in the
giveaway like we have all of the new
heart lipsticks is so good I've already
pulled out my favorite shades certain
shades that I wouldn't particularly well
at dark Browns and stuff so on my
quality how much jump in the ocean even
real and she looks like I haven't even
touched me yet but I just grabbed like
all the stuff out of it so special we
have a bunch of cute face melted Matt we
have tardis lip prior to face peach
Oprah Anastasio Beverly Hills cold pop
I'm just going to grab all of these
lipsticks out of here and put them onto
here again for hygienic reasons I don't
want to put these in the giveaway pile
what's going on
nearly done but update on the lipsticks
there's also a bunch of Kylie lip kits
in here as well and a very curious pug
given that I am like the laziest person
in the world
kind of like gave up a little bit so I
put everything down here that I could
make enough room for but I bless still a
bunch of stuff in there in there and
there's so much face makeup in there so
there is so much makeup here oh my god
if you add that like everything in this
we found that as a value thousand
thousand be a lot of money eventually so
much that ridiculous though I'm going to
keep moving on I shelf so I watch to get
there and I don't this video tribute
like ten hours long we have a bunch of
benefit Porefessional which I'm going to
put in a giveaway pile gone everywhere
as well as this big bad boy as well we
have this huge not what's going on with
my hair
I thinks local feel yeah just follow all
concealers and every single shade
possible I think I'm able to keep this
away I think I already decided stuff for
giveaway Charlie Christian we have lots
of mascaras and the stuff there's no way
I'd give away in the sky which isn't in
a packaging to a giveaway I noticed as
we know from crystal group sticker on
that Physicians Formula color for my
green what's a drugstore in here the
minimun in the rest of park we have got
some bondo sand stuff we've got some
brushes we have makeup holders for inque
dr. Dennis gross my favorite stuff
blackheads poor stuff
Sephora lipstick eyelashes and sneaky
cat blondie foundation hiding there
again this is going to go in the charity
pile
so the charity pile is definitely
growing closely which are actually so
happy to see so this exercise right now
of all the stuff that's going to be
throwing nated oh my goodness so much
stuff it's crazy
okay now a while ago and you'd actually
section out like ten giveaway bags for a
giveaway but I'm doing in a different
way now that I'm doing on YouTube so in
each one of these bags we have more
giveaway items so essentially all of
this stuff is pretty much all that's
going to go to charity then we have lots
and lots and lots of things in here so
for examples mac lipstick every news
we've got mascaras but skincare we have
lipstick ah one of the toothpaste
Christmas palettes let me try and open
it with one hand can we do it things
yeah look how nice is that and it has a
mirror as well gorgeous so that's going
to go in the littler pan
so what I'm going to do now is I'm just
going to empty out all of this pretty
boy stuff that I plan like three months
ago and I'm going to lay it out with all
the other giveaways stuff so we can see
exactly what you guys can win
okay I like out of breath oh my god Gary
for the skies I had pretty much divided
everything up now so we have a giveaway

tied cap on the Urban Decay everything
you could ever think of that we have a
whole box of stuff from what is this
brand designer brands whole bunch of

other things I'm like running out of
breath how am I good and I call myself
fit and healthy home because so that is
the donation pile for now I still have
more to add stuff so we're going to my
recent deliveries so that's the first
part second part is
the giveaway we have all the goodies
that you guys can win in the giveaway
zone so just to go over like a brief
overview we have some stuff from
colour-pop the bomb toothpaste or
Smashbox gel from for the hoola to face
self-taught palette to face bronzes tile
it is lots of MAC lipsticks that have
never been used where I carry max dust
car pop pull the bronze and Smashbox -
first are lots of vyse lipsticks

they're real professional car swap matte
look Mac sister / green stuff from
bareMinerals but on second sky a bunch
of Frank body stuff Real Techniques
stuff Nasser moon sleep makeup Kat Von D
cup FX Oprah more - based stuff type
stuff benefit what's up I love that my
letter it's so good benefit professional
or the bonds we highlight is the urban
decay stuff or banal concealers and just
lots of solvers actually like there's
just so much stuff here I'm going to
give you guys a very detailed slow-mo
overview so you can pick anything up
that I didn't mention
now when it comes to us give away you
guys need to be following my Instagram
because all going to be done by my
Instagram page if you don't have an
Instagram just make one for the surface
if you really want to win but I don't do
boy through YouTube it's very hard to
tell people following you and all that
kind of stuff so it's going to be
through Instagram and I will lay out the
rules I think we're going to do is in
sections you're going to be like the lip
giveaway the skincare giveaway the eyes
and brows giveaway and so I think
that'll be the most effective way to
give away like all this past conditions
so I stopped it's ridiculous so I'm
super excited to donate all these
goodies to the women at the shelter as
well as to the charity shop aren't
appealing to guys have your own makeup
that you're not going to use or it's not
your shade rinsing it's always better to
donate than keeps it lying around in
your drawers because you're going to
make someone else extremely happy
because they're going to have a product
that they're dying to have and it's just
sitting on your drawers it just it just
makes sense it just makes so awesome I'm
really gonna figure out how I'm going to
fit all that in my car my Jeep can't
like handle anything is hilarious Little
Miss meeting is ready for her dinner
bugging me for some Dindin so I'm gonna
have to get going and start to organize
get away all this stuff thank you guys
not watching today I'll see you on my
Instagram I have enjoyed going through
this ridiculous amount of makeup and if
you do participate in the giveaway all
the best of luck from me then you go so
much for watching and I'll see you on
Tuesday
