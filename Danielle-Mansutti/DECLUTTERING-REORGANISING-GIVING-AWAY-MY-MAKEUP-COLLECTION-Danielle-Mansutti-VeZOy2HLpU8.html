today's video we are decluttering and
organizing my makeup collection
literally 90% of it was like see you
later I've been very kind of Bruce all
this time because I just felt so heavy
by the amount of products that I had I'm
so mean hates being wasteful I'm not a
collector I am just someone that puts
makeup on their own face so I am so so
lucky and so fortunate to receive so
many makeup products in here but
sometimes I do have to kind of narrow it
down see what products I will use
personally of everything else I don't
know to women shelters friends and
family because I just feel it's a little
bit of a waste I mean I have makeup but
I'll never use and will just expire so I
tend to do color every six months or so
because I do actually have quite a lot
of makeup that I won't use myself
because it's just stuff like foundations
in the wrong shade lipstick colors I'd
never used because a lot of time PR
companies will send you stuff we're just
every single shade of the range which I
really appreciate because you get to try
out everything but when I have a
foundation which is way too light or too
dark it just doesn't make sense to me
having it so I hope you understand the
kind of purpose behind the decluttering
also the organization makes me feel so
happy like I'm someone whose environment
affects their moves so much so for me
just decluttering my drawers and
organizing stuff makes me feel like so
content it's a really hard thing to
explain but I have filmed the whole
process this is gonna be a long the
videos to make sure you have a snack
it's he some popcorn it's something
really nice you're nice and comfy and
without further ado let's jump into it
alright so here is stuff I have
accumulated within the last week so this
is from like meetings events stuff
that's right at my door this week I'm
gonna lay this all out and I think it's
best to kind of declutter this first
because I need to figure out what new is
going in my drawers before I make room
for it if that makes sense so let me
just lay this out in front of me and I'm
gonna start a bit of a donation pile and
then a four-out pile and then a keep
pile as well so I've just laid out
everything that was in those boxes and
those bags and everything oh I love me
as you started because there's lots of
stuff to get through here and please
keep in mind that I am pretty brutal
when it comes to the
donation and decluttering process
because I don't believe there's a single
person on earth unless you are a makeup
artist and you are freelancing I don't
believe I need you know as much makeup
as I'm said I'm so grateful for
absolutely everything that I'm sent I do
find it incredibly wasteful for me to
keep stuff that I will never use for
example like foundation shows that
aren't my shade so that's why I donate
90% of everything that I get sent or I'm
given at events to women's shelters and
I keep all the essentials that I will
use because I really really really
dislike being a wasteful person and it
means so much more to me if someone else
gets much more use out of it like this
foundation for me it's so so so so so
light so obviously what's the point of
that being in my drawer when it can go
to some fabulous woman or man who would
love it a lot more and get more use out
of it so I'm thinking that let's start
with skin that start with foundations
I've just grabbed my current finish that
I'm using I know I'm the wrong color my
arm I'm not paid turn this is NARS
Barcelona that is my perfect shape when
I'm thanked and so basically I will just
compare other foundations against it
like that and if they are incredibly off
then that will go in donation so that's
how I'm gonna work with it basically I
am just gonna compare as many shows as I
can
to Barcelona and then see how some what
she looks like both the white cell or
our foundations that I have here are not
my shade that are very very very light I
find that PR tend to think that I'm
quite pale I know I actually am right I
mean I were fake tans my face is never
that light so I do have this in my
perfect shade so I don't need these two
at all then one of the foundations we
have we have some chopped rainforest of
the sea so I think out of these three I
think the middle one is looking quite
promising
this one is medium sand then we have
these clinic even better glow light
reflecting makeup with SPF 15 these look
really cool one's kind of ivory one's
kind of like warmth
so I'm gonna put these in like a try
pile I really want to try these and see
how they look so they're gonna go in the
cake I'm not too sure which one my shake
would be and we have some cover effects
power play foundations g50 is my like
ultimate shade in this so here we have n
50g for T and n 40 and out of these I
would say this one is really off however
this one is actually quite bang on which
is G for T so that is a shade lighter
than I use normally and what other
funders should okay we have these two
these came today they are the lifeproof
long-wear mecha max
foundations I think that's so exciting
that Mehcad doing our own foundation now
I would say that this one is probably
more my shade than those of that one
although they are both nice
so once and ones natural I think again
I'm gonna have to put these in a try
pile I haven't tried this yet so I don't
know I'll just keep them by just in case
these primers from Y sell off so say
like so so so so so so sick because
they're all for different purposes I
really like the yellow one and the clear
one looks like the gold in that and if
you can see the reflex but it's just
beautiful and then we have some brushes
these are from Tarte it looks so
gorgeous I love the rose gold on this
this one looks kind of like a blush
brush it's super soft I'm like a sucker
for brushes I find it like I'm picturing
such a hoarder of them so I'll just pop
that packaging away so this could be
like a highlighter suppose but I do
literally thing that the packaging of
these are so beautiful
how could I not keep them alright so we
then have the Too Faced lives of
festival
I showed up palette and I not actually
used this yet or swatch this yet so I
will quickly swatch it
this is euphoric rainbow life sunset
dream I mean the colors are really
really pretty
they seem a little bit chalky I suppose
like not as strongly pigmented as I
would have hoped I do have a really love
the color selection I do think it would
be really cool for festival tutorials so
I think for that reason I'm a keeper
okay so we have a naked Heat mini one
I've already been sent one of these so i
will donate this there's no point in me
having to and then we have the tarte
hosted palette i actually received this
today it looks absolutely unreal like
that looks so so gorgeous I know that
I'm gonna get so much use out of this
I'm just gonna quickly give that a
swatch oh my god alright that copper one
is so beautiful you get a makeup wipe I
think I'm gonna get like pickup out to
the FBI hold on Primark face wipes to
the rescue right now this is a YCL jo
with three cool tone colors in it it's
not really my color range I suppose
absolutely beautiful product but I doubt
I would use those colors so i will
donate this then we have the it's part
tingling treatment skin care which is
for exfoliating balancing and minimizing
the appearance of pores which sounds
super exciting oh god let me try this so
it's like a liquid I thought that would
be like really different so it just
feels like water is that right it's not
tingling anything
hello oh it's an acid complex the
powerful be a little up pH of
rebalancing blend renewed the surface
and appearance of skin why don't I feel
tingling I don't feel anything nor do I
still really like anything exfoliating
so I'm gonna put this one in a donate my
consulate changing up the camera I don't
know which one's the best feel like give
you a proper view of things okay this is
a really really cute Tarte palette this
is the foil finger paints shadow palette
that is so gorgeous this gold here my
lord this is the clay play volume to eye
in cheek part by tot this is really
pretty
and I'm thinking about looking at this
looks looks like super prom to me which
I will be doing a tutorial for very soon
so I think I'm a gold keep this because
it's really oh my god and it's super
pigmented oh yeah and we have the Tarte
man-eater palette which is a bit of me
that is gorgeous
okay so let me just give it a swatch
yeah but it's pigmented it's beautiful
a hundred percent keeping that that
would be such a good traveling palette
as well because it is just like so it's
just so small perfect colors love it
alright how it's getting smaller all
right what do we have here we have three
Estee Lauder what is this the Double
Wear custom coverage correcting duo one
of them is green this one says light
this one says full
what do you mean though okay so you
well like and then what do you do you do
the other side as well I guess looks
pretty cool alright what does it
actually say on the box the light form
of effect large areas what full-coverage
consentrate concentrate concentrate it
helps cover spots for 24 oh I get you're
all right that is super super super
super light
let me just probably won't actually I
know I won't you ever use a green one so
I'll put that away
this other one looks like a bit more me
this in terms of its color it's a bit
more like Pallavi and a little bit
darker so I think oh yeah this is going
to my mum necessary mum if you're
watching you get a nest a load of
concealer because my mum is a lot more
fair-skinned than me I've got my dad's
olive tones so I will keep the yellowy
one that is really interesting and then
we have this lifeproof mecha max if this
is like the banana reef I don't think
I'm like keeping it because I love that
one so much oh it's just white mmm I
think I used one before I didn't
necessarily like if I do love the banana
powder either banana powder all the time
so in that case I will donate that
because I know I'm not gonna use a white
powder I'm guessing this is a
translucent one yeah it's a loose powder
it was it wet oh yeah god it's so wet
okay it's why it that kind of scares me
because the flashback but you know I'll
give it a go I will give it a go okay
this looks so so Christmassy to me this
is a Smashbox liquid lipstick oh my god
that is so nice
check that out that's super pretty so
I think this will be perfect for
Christmas so I'm gonna keep that funny
isn't it how like there's some makeup
products that we're only gonna use like
once a year but we're like yeah I'm
gonna keep that and then when it comes
to it I just don't like this one's like
similar but in a copper which is my
thing
oh that's really really pretty
okay that's safe you can see that so
that's like really really really pretty
shade something again I wouldn't
normally wear but I just think that
formulas so nice that I'm a is looking a
bit all right this is a two-faced angel
tears which I guess it's clear Oh
actually no it's not okay I don't wear
lip glosses but I actually really like
that it's really just like she owes and
I'm pretty and you know what I'm gonna
keep it no I didn't actually think I
would but I actually quite like how
that's any quite subtle it's not to like
overbearing we've got some lipsticks to
open from Tarte as well this is gonna be
the longest video in the world I can
already feel it this is gonna be like my
longest video for sure it's like so in
depth about everything that is like
purpley and sparkly and not pigmented
that's a shame
alright the kids I just watched that I'm
not gonna donate it because that's not
hygienic so that will go in the donate
to friends pile because I have like
women's shelters friends friends get the
stuff that I've used once or twice
because I don't want to donate anything
which you know I've touched because that
is not cool then we have this one which
is you know I just think these
rainforest to the sea lipsticks or no go
for me I'm just not too fussed about
that formula so we'll donate those we
are getting there guys it's like smaller
this is the cover FX illuminating
setting spray this is so No
like honestly it's just like a fine mist
I hate it when a setting spray is super
watery and this one's beautiful I'm
keeping it sure then we have the
Clinique take the day off balm I've gone
through one of these before so
definitely gonna keep this one as well
and this is the it cosmetics bye bye
pause I just went to an event with it
cosmetics and we tried this at the event
and it was really really beautiful
keeping that and then this as well isn't
it cosmetics bronzer and there's this
brush as well you literally just like
sweep it along and it was really really
really stunning so keeping that too then
I have the it cosmetics your skin but
better CC cream illumination so this is
like the new version of the CC cream
this one's in medium I love this just
like you know doesn't even look like
you're wearing makeup just looks like
you have really good skin so it's a
really good one to keep as well as the
brushes from cover effects as well okay
and complex I mean eCos legs this is
makeup effects eliminating primer which
I used in also I'm pretty sure it's
super super super sheer I like that
right keeping that then we have a Bobbi
Brown highlighting powder oh my god look
at this like oh my god 100% keeping that
and I have a bunch of cover effects
these these shimmer veils these are
really good for your eyes I used to
think they were lip sticks but they're
actually don't like them more for your
eyes I just don't know what it is when I
do my eye shadow I always forget about
stuff like this I just use like a
palette and then I forget about all
these like liquid eyeshadows and starts
here are the shimmer veils now looking
at these I'm trying to work out which
ones I've used I would not use this one
I think the rose gold one is very me as
is this pink one here my arm is gonna be
like the most glittery arm you've ever
seen we have got two liquid matte
lipsticks or the first one make sure
that you can actually see it first one
is like a nude kind of brown
whoo that was like really really
hydrating and pigmented second one is a
kind of what kind of red this is okay
the formulas of us are so different the
nude one is way different like more
liquidy the red one looks very pigmented
the nude one however just looks super
watery to me and they are very smudgy
very very smudgy so don't think that
they would last through a meal because
they're not drying they are very just
like wet all right this is a top lip
bling I'm actually not heard of this
before oh my god that packaging is
stunning gorgeous how have I never seen
this before I don't understand oh my god
oh my god I do not wear lip gloss but
that is making me one way look buzz so
this one looks like bit more golden
I love these then we have some cover
effects drops I absolutely love these
drops okay so here are these swatches of
the drops now I'm looking at this and
I'm thinking what would I use as a
highlight of myself
as you can see some are a lot more
intense than others so actually it would
be like oh my god I'm gonna break if I
do that mmm actually really hard to say
because if there were our shadows it
obviously go for that second one that
gold one but because they're more like
highlight oh maybe the middle one and so
that's these two so I didn't actually
think I would because I mean the gold is
so beautiful but I just think it would
be a little bit too intense for me
as a highlight so I shot a second one
all right this is the oh my god the
George Armani luminous silk lit really
like to try this for the longest time so
I think it's not quite my right shade so
if I put a little bit of my Barcelona
my hand and then comparing it to this
guy which I still can't believe I've
never actually used the luminous silk
myself this is the luminous silk here as
you can see it's a lot more ivory and my
bus learners a lot more yellow now it's
really difficult because I really really
really want to try it but it's obviously
not quite my tone the shade is pretty
good it's just like not yellow enough
but I think I will keep it for the sake
of trying it anyway I may have a tan
which is a bit more kind of green based
one day less you know who better than my
ig works I will keep it then I have the
judge Romani second skin makeup so this
is a foundation I believe that they
discontinued it and have just brought it
back so that's super exciting so this
one does actually look a bit oh that
does actually look really really good
for me I need to try this like ASAP it
looks so good then we have a mascara
this mascara is like quite nice and thin
which is really really beautiful and I
will keep that I've got a Beauty Blender
of course keeping that but then the
little ones I'm donating I don't
particularly use the little ones so I'll
keep the big pink one and I'll keep the
actually not I already have about five
of these so I can donate one of these
actually and I do not have one of these
and I'm very excited about this this is
a bTW Bleen abusive Lina am i ok a
beauty blender cleanser I need this for
my beauty blenders are disgusting right
now
and we have a it cosmetics meet
light/medium bye bye under-eye is it
it's not coming out very well
oh my god
ok this concealer super super heavy duty
like a list will go a long way with this
concealer so I'll keep that but I have
to keep in mind it's very very high
coverage please that is my keep pile
which is actually really really really
big and this is the donation pile so I'm
gonna put that into like stuff for my
mom stuff friends
and stuff for women shelter but it is
now time that we've arranged that to go
over to my mess and actually start on
organizing my drawers so we're gonna go
through all my drawers and we're going
to just take everything out
declutter gonna clean up my desk or that
jazz
so just to explain this draw this is
foundations CC creams concealers and
powders however I do actually have a
little thing over here that I keep like
Holograms in which I'll show you later
and yeah all this is good so let's go
through what I kept so I've kept two of
the new NARS foundations as well as a
NARS Velvet Matte skin tint thing
two of the cover effects power plays two
of the it cosmetics CC creams then I
have the mecca max one to try this is
the Urban Decay all night at ease all
the time then the Georgia remaining one
which I want to try it the right price
at the C matte and poreless Maybelline
and the two clinic ones to try as well
every concealers of course I've got
shaped a we've got the mecca max went to
try I've got bye-bye under-eye we're
gonna wake me up why I sell or hours and
this is a color pop one and then for my
kind of like skin powders or whatever
loose powders I've kept a few however I
do actually have heaps that I'm gonna
put another drawer just for like other
things but this is my everyday kind of
ones but I will keep some others in here
too
now for the lips it's a little bit not
super straight but I've kind of arranged
it in a way of like let's dock just so I
know when I'm grabbing it what to do and
this looks on this camera this looks so
don't convert everything else it's like
freaking me out anyway I've just kept
like my lip liners and lip top his lip
gloss in there and then here we've got
stuff like the wire so we've got lots of
tight lip paints got some algaas Stila
we've got some and it stars it and
hiding at the back to face melted the
smashbox one we just showed we just
showed i just showed you
I'm already losing my body then I have
Mac velvet Teddy's and some other lip so
that's all my lip products excluding the
stuff that's in my hologram power over
there
obviously we're doing some some watchin
too and got a few things to pop in the
donation bottle as well so we are two
drawers down here is how our little
donation pals looking so far next we
have got eyes shadow which is very
exciting my favorite makeup product so
let's go and do that alright now this
drawer is super interesting because it's
kind of the drawer that I've just shoved
things in I think we all have these
drawers in our lives so I think this was
like makeup palettes for my last
declutter I didn't want to get rid of
but I didn't necessarily use that often
anymore like extra things or whatever
but I kind of feel like it's a waste of
space if I'm not gonna be using the
products so alright so like the money
MUA makeup geek palette I do love it I
love it level of it and this is gonna be
the hardest part for me to go through
because I do actually genuinely love
these products it's just that they're
taking up too much space and I'm not
using them very often so I really really
have to figure out if it's
all right I have really really changed
this drawer so at the back actually have
a few pallets that I'm just gonna keep
but I decided to just put primers extra
powders etc in here so I've got like the
sprays that I showed you guys before
some beauty blenders some extra to face
powders and then I've got like some
primers and stuff sitting in here so
these are kind of stuff it I haven't
really used yet like I've used kept one
day before but the huda beauty and some
other things like avenues the peachy one
yet anything so that's a draw I'll let
you had to get rid of so many eyeshadow
palettes that I've loved for so long but
I just thought I'm not gonna use them
anymore so oh yeah by the way check out
this you guys aren't seeing that drug
that there was a mess but we are feeling
very light which I am loving I'm loving
the fact that this is like giving away
off my shoulders if that makes sounds
like just having the essentials in my
drawers oh it feels good I mean look at
this pile it's like ridiculous right now
my god
oh my god I was just like trendy the
last drawer or something okay so this is
the first side of the drawers done so
here's a quick overview we've got skin
up here so we've got foundation and we
have powder and concealer second drawer
we have lips third drawer is a mess
fourth drawer is like backups extra
powders and then primers setting sprays
it's such a roll the last drawer we will
figure out in the end I'm so annoyed
all right time and look at how much of a
mess
everything still is but it's time for
this side
all right so brows mascara eyeliners and
donation so I have just kept my absolute
favorite so I've got benefit roller lash
Too Faced better than sex I've got like
everything in a mini as well
my backup bad girl bang it's when I'm
using at the minute I have a why sell
one and it cosmetics superhero and a
mini there as well and they're real then
I've got a bunch of wire so I've our
products hourglass IRA products so many
benefit and slate I love this powder
it's on and my favorite IRA powder FR I
do again have other ones which I'll show
you my hologram pile later and then I
just have some eyeliners in here I've
got lots of the it's heart this one and
I've got some colourful ones and then
I've got some pots too so again feeling
like a massive weight off my shoulders
because I have way too many mascaras
like it was just insane
probably my favorite draw of all time is
the glitter drawers you may have seen
all of the gypsy shrine jewels that I've
got most of my glitters are from gypsy
trials I have some Nicks got my glitter
glue and I've got some little like
pigments and stuff there too so this is
like my favorite drawer
oh my goodness it's so just like hard
saying goodbye to so many good products
but I know I know that going to better
home so I've got my bronzers here I've
got some two-faced knows who why I sell
stuff then I've got the new Bobby Brown
one I've got lots of Oprah that I've got
some stuff from like Al Basquiat a hits
for artists good shot I love them know
they were hiding you my drawers for so
long and now I'm obsessed with them some
blush even though I literally never
blush then all my cover FX dropped some
extra artists could sure sure and I've
got some pallets from algaas sticks I
love these sticks are so good a sleek
palette an hourglass palette and then a
NYX palette as well
oh my god the pile is getting bigger oh
my god
so that was actually the first pile that
I didn't take anything out of I do
actually go through my I shop I look i
shadow pellets a lot and reorganize them
but I've I will always no matter what
keeps this Too Faced chocolate bar
because I remember saving up for a full
weeks of my job when I was I think the
console to afford it it's just like a
special pallet to me um so I've got who
knows does it dusk
Lorelai's palette this one's a two-faced
glitter chocolate bar peach open decay
and I could heat then I've got heaps of
stacked or like morphe palette
I'm just being the edge cosmetics parts
as well then I've got some tart stuff to
face stuff and then at the back I keep
my colorful stuff like other BH
Cosmetics and I've also got like the new
Too Faced festival one as well and I
think that I'm nearly done oh my god all
I've got to do is like tackle my actual
like desk clean that up but I'm actually
because my bottom drawer is just like
storage and stuff let me move this guy
out the way
so the drawer overview is now like
feeling so much butter so mascaras
eyeliners eyebrows then we have all the
glitters love this drawer then we have
highlights
bronzes and blushes and then we have
eyes shadow palettes as well we did it
we did it we did it why is it not focus
that's really I know you think yeah oh
my god I'm so excited that we clean desk
in like organized drawers and oh I feel
like such a weight has lifted and I
think this is my favorite role
it's just so pretty okay so this is
where I keep my holy grails and this is
where I film by the way I'll sit here
and I'll film so I have a bunch of stuff
in here that you guys wouldn't have seen
so that some of these are away and my
drawers but there's some things that I
keep here like the Too Faced peach
perfect moment I love cooler artists get
your stuff I've put that tart thing here
before cuz I know I'm gonna love it the
tart medium shape types my favorite
bunch of lip liners with scars I'm using
eyebrow products I'm using Excel etc and
then baked products that I like to use
while I film and stuff to keep myself
hydrated but oh my goodness like oh my
god this pile alright so how on earth
did this there's a lot of makeup a lot
of makeup to give away so now I have
even more fun tasks going through this
pile and actually figuring out what I'm
giving to friends what I'm donating to
women's shelters all that jazz if you've
made it this far congratulations what a
marathon that was I really really
enjoyed filming this whole process for
