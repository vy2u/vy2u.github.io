hair and makeup tutorial for you guys
it's something really sort of glitzy and
girly and I just love this kind of
makeup so if you'd like to see how I got
from a left to right then just keep
watching starting with a tapered
blending brush I'm using the shades
sunset from the Stila in the light
palette I'm using this as my transition
shade so I'm using a big fluffy brush to
just get all into my crease now I'm
going in with a gorgeous shade bubbly
I'm just packing this on my eye just for
a little sparkle
now using the shades sandstone I'm just
going to place it into my crease just to
darken up the look and create a bit more
depth into the eye itself but I'm not
gonna go too harsh because I don't want
us to end up being another smoky eye I'm
now placing that same shade on the outer
part of my eye
now with the shade kitten I'm just going
to place this in my inner eye area I
think it's the tear duct area but I
always say the wrong way it just helps
to open up the eye a bit and I just
think it's really pretty
just gonna kill my eyelashes and apply a
coat of mascara I'm using the essence I
love extreme crazy boy in the sky and
once again with kitten I'm just going to
use this as my brow bone highlight just
helps to open up your whole eye I think
it just completes the eye look
altogether
now taking some makeup remover I'm using
the micellar cleansing water so I'm just
going to use this to erase any fallout
of her from my eye shutter and just
create a crisp straight clear nice line
if you know what I mean
so now I'm just applying some falsies
this is of course optional but this is
just what I'd like to do I have a
foundation I'm using my Real Techniques
buffing brush of my double where I stay
Lord of foundation and I'm just going to
put this onto my face and then buff it
in with my favorite brush at the moment
I love the buffing brush
what is your old favorite brush your
foundation because I cannot find
anything better than this leave in the
comments what your favorite foundation
brush is that would help me out a
tongues I'd like to find a new favorite
now he's in the Rimmel wake me up
concealer just to clean up all the mess
from underneath my eyes I'm just going
to dab this on and then use a sponge to
dab it or blend it out but you can see
what I'm doing now returning back to the
eyes I'm using sand stone and I'm going
to put this on my lower lash line I'm
doing this after the concealer just
because it's a bit more dramatic once
it's on after you've cleaned it up if
that makes any sense and then using
Khitan I'm just going to pack this on my
tea ducts once again just to brighten up
the whole look so now I'm just applying
some more mascara to my bottom lashes I
always do this after my concealer so
there's no more cleanliness and all that
kind of stuff so I'm just going to put
on my bottom lashes and help to just
bring a bit more drama to the look so
now with my hoola bronze up by benefit
I'm just going to places onto my
cheekbones and I've angled the brush
upwards so I'm trying to blend it
upwards into my temples and then a
little bit on my forehead now using I
believe it's the rockatuer blush from
benefit I'm just going to put this on
the same brush and put this on the
apples of my cheeks
oh my god this product I just bought
soft and gentle by Mac and it's
incredible just look oh it's amazing I
love it so I'm just using this as my
highlight I've only just recently got
something using this I bought this about
a week ago and I'm in love with it it's
there my favorite favorite favorite
highlighter so putting on my Cupid's bow
and down my nose sneezing lady danger
from Mac I'm just going to pop this onto
my lips it's a very cool red tone it's
almost got a hint of orange in it and
I'm loving this shade and now it is
definitely time to sort out this hair so
I'm going to be using my nume a 3:1
killing one-step now for summer discount
codes for you guys if you use the code
strawberry you'll get 40% off the entire
new me website freeze trailer shipping
and US shipping and the code jewels you
will get $100 off all sets ten dollars
Australian shipping or free us shipping
which is incredible and I'm using this
big bad boy for it today and so firstly
I'm just using the truffle products in
my hair running it through with my
fingers so this product makes my hair
very soft and smooth and it can be uses
an anti-frizz serum heat protectant and
it's also good to just add shine to your
hair and now it's time to pop on the
gloves and get started so firstly of
course I'm just going to clip the top
half section of my hair behind my ears
and just concentrate on my bottom bits
of her first that makes sense
so I've heated up to 200 Celsius I'm
just going to wrap it around the curler
and I like to approach the hair from the
back so I like to just wrap it around
the curl of my arm behind my head and
start at the back and then once I let go
I just squeeze it all together and then
drop the curls to create a very loose
effect
so as you can see I'm just repeating
this in different sections I like to
keep my sections quite thick because I
don't like really tight curls I'm into
more like the loose curls so this is the
difference that it's made and I would
even brush it through anything it's
incredible
Sam is going to take out my hair and
concentrate on the top part once again
I'm just going to brush everything
through and throw back the coat bits
that I've already done and I'm loving
how healthy and shiny my hair looks
whenever I go out after using this it's
amazing
so for the very front part of my hair I
make sure that I'm curling it away from
my face so I wrap it around like this on
an angle it gives it a lot more volume I
find it just gives a lot more bouncing I
really like it and I'm just going to
tease my hair and we are done so this
was the finished look guys I really hope
you enjoyed it and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
