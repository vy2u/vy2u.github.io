extremely swollen face after dental
surgery and it doesn't matter what my
face looks like because it's a message
that I'm getting across which is a lot
more important to me
mate is coming to an end and Mei has
been Mental Health Awareness Month and
for those that don't know me I am
someone who has and I will not say
suffer because I hate that tough but I'm
someone who has experienced depression
for a lot of my life and I experienced
it for the first time when I was 12
years old and I also experienced anxiety
and panic attacks at times as well
depression is one of those things that a
lot of people in the world don't
understand and because they don't
understand when you experience it
yourself you feel like you're the only
one going through it because it's not
approached in the right way in our
society depression is just an annoying
little thing that likes to enter your
life at random moments and overstay its
welcome and all you have to do is
honestly just punch that depression in
the face and tell it to go away we need
to learn to laugh at our depression just
like oh god here it comes again and not
give it the power to allow it to take
over who we are a lot of people in the
world do not understand depression and
believe that the in depress means that
you're a broken person or there's
something wrong with you but there's
absolutely nothing wrong with you there
are millions and millions and millions
of people that are going through what
you're going through as well and there
needs to be more talk about it there
needs to be more openness about it
because if we treat it as we do a common
cold would it really affect us as much
something which I have never spoken
about online when it comes to my
depression for good reason
is that I have allowed it at moments to
enter my mind and consume me and take me
to places that are so dark and so
damaging that I don't even know what I'm
considering and what I mean by that is
your mind taking you to a place we start
believing there's no reason to be here
anymore that people will be happier if
you leave you're a burden to people
things are going wrong in your life so a
reason because you're not meant to be
here but I can tell you that you are
meant to be here
you are meant to experience so many more
things in life list of things in your
head of places you want to see and
things you want to do and there will be
something whether it's skydiving seeing
the Northern Lights and Iceland our
society is designed in a way to make us
depressed industry is the rise of us
feeling bad about ourselves when it
comes to aging we are scared of it
because we see anti-aging cream anti
wrinkle creams advertised every road
that we're meant to believe that looking
old as a bad thing we have grown up
surrounded by imagery of these ideal
westernized bodies and if we don't fit
that standard we believe there's
something wrong with us I fall into this
category today I'm extremely swollen I
put a massive mask of makeup on my face
because society's taught me that if I
lay here with no makeup on being
incredibly swollen and looking what is
to find is ugly I would be less of a
person
we teach ourselves to worry we teach
ourselves to feel inadequate because we
believe that's what's right it's not the
only things in life that matter are the
moments that make you so happy to be
alive I want you to understand that you
have made people smile and you make them
laugh and people genuinely love you
whether or not it feels that way they do
and it's something when I hear that I
feel like rolling my eyes being like
well no one loves me but they do trust
me things will always appear worse than
you think in your mind with such so that
we are unfortunately we believe those
things but I want you to turn around and
just say screw depression I'm going to
keep going and I'm going to show it how
strong I am
I'm going to do it for the day that I'm
floating in the ocean and I just think
I'm so glad that I kept going and I say
is that life is waiting for you whenever
you're ready it will always be here
waiting for you it may take time to get
through the pain but no matter what I'm
so proud of you for still being here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
