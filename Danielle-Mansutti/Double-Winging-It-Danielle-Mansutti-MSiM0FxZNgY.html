done a tutorial today for a double
eyelid a wink
I've practiced this look about three
times now so I'm definitely not perfect
at it but this is as good as I can do it
you see that I've had this look on
snapchat a lot asking for your eyes
wanted to see it so it's finally here I
heard that you enjoy it and let's get
straight into it
so to start off the looks today I'm just
gonna prep my eyes with a soft ochre Pro
Longwear Paint Pot and to apply this I'm
using a concealer buffer brush which is
number one for cherry from a zoo
let's start off with today I'm using my
Steeler eyes are the window pilot in
mind and I'm just going to dust the
lighter shade in the palette all over my
eyes and then we're going to use the
same brush once again to apply this
eyeshadow to my eye
and then next I'm gonna mix these two
brown shades and just put that on my
crease to add some depth into my eyes
now taking a sigma e30 9 button blend
brush I was going to apply as my crease
I'm using a sigma winged liner eo6 brush
with the Inglot AMC island gel in 72 and
i'm going to create a v wing with this
pink one I'm gonna put the black
underneath it so the ping wants to be a
little bit thicker than the black
and that's time for the really fun part
which is the wing so we're going to make
sure the wing is a little bit thicker
than normal because we do have a second
aisle and underneath so map out from
your waterline to the middle of your
brow where they meet in the middle
surround here and you're going to want
to wing back to the bottom of your lash
line and then wing it back to the top of
your lash line
so here's what your eyes should be
looking like so far this is actually the
easy part because the next part we're
going to be grabbing a zoeva three one
five fine liner brush which is even
thinner than the last brush that we use
and what we're going to do with this one
is to try and get a wing right
underneath where that pink wing is now
taking my England AMC Ireland gel in 77
thank you guys so much for watching this
tutorial today I hope that you enjoyed
it and always seeing you really soon
bye Joanna this job I earn up Island Oh

practiced about I've practiced this look
