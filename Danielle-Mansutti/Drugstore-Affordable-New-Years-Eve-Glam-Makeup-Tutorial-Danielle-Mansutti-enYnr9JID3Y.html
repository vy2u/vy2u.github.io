hello to my baby hairs what is going on
here
today I've created an affordable drug
store Year's Eve makeup tutorial and I
hope you guys like it I had such fun
making this mistake oh my god there are
no warm tones what is happening Who am I
I don't even know like this is crazy for
me so most of the stuff that I'm using
today I just found like a boots or super
driving super super super easy super
affordable never further do this do it
do it
first things first I need to tackle my
eyebrows because I feel like they frame
the whole face I make everything come
together so I'm gonna be using this
sleek makeup eyebrow to a musical feel
I'm very sorry about it so I'm gonna be
starting with this sleek eyebrow is
there a brow kit so here's how this
looks and I'm gonna be using this powder
on my brows today and also how extra is
this brush it's insane I'm just gonna do
brows and eyes first for foundation
because we're using a lot of glitter and
when it comes to glitter it is like a
disaster waiting to happen if you do
your foundation first because there is
always so much fallout so I just
completely miss my brother so that we
can clean up as we go even though we do
kind of want to like disco balls today
it's not gonna be like a festival makeup
tutorial and then go over here with this
Rimmel wake me up concealer I'm just
gonna use this to clean up the brow
section because I have gone overboard
whoa how does her intense
I always forget it was so intense to set
my brows into place I'm gonna use the
there's no the NYX control freak by brow
gel
and taking that concealer once again I'm
just going to pop it all over my eyelids
and we're going to use this as our
eyelid primer so we're going to be using
this NYX palette on our eyes today and
we're going to start with this shade
here and then progress onto this shade
as well and just go ahead and pop it in
the corner of my eyes
and then taking a blending brush I'm
just gonna start blending this out till
here's something like this and now with
the darker shade from before I'm just
gonna repeat that process again so it's
gonna do pin this up as we go we're
focusing on keeping the middle bear
because that's what we're going to place
all the glitter and now from the NYX
fire palette I'm gonna be taking this
really really really gorgeous deep
purple shade I'm gonna put this over
everything once again that's gonna be a
way of like deepening everything up and
making it dark and sexy and smoky as
well
Nicoletta I'm gonna use this next
pigment which is in number three I will
be applying it with the NYX glitter glue
as well
and then once at glitter so I'm sorry go
back in with the blending brush from
before and I'm just going to add it back
into the front and the sides so now that
that is done it is time to just clean up
underneath so I'm going to go in before
my foundation and I'm going to use the
Rimmel wake me up concealer once again
I'm just gonna pop this under my eyes
because I'm just going to go straight in
with a flat brush I'm gonna sweep the
edge as well essentially you kind of
want it to go from your eyebrow to your
lower lash line and then for mascara I'm
gonna use this la roche-posay mascara
and for my lashes today I'm going to use
to be a daniel restore of luxe
collection eyelashes in selfie these are
just the balm like they are incredible
so finally now that all the
concentrating part is over we can focus
on the face finally and I'm just sitting
here eating a dolly mixture he'll kiss
the most amazing subscriber in the world
I came to my beautiful are making great
gave me a packet filling mixture nails
like so I need a Plaza Foundation I feel
absolutely terrifying with this like
intense oh hey I'm like those in this is
the Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
and this one is in 310 Sun beige I'm
gonna apply this with a real techniques
brush all over the base Missisquoi a
full coverage foundation which i think
is perfect for New Year's Eve but I just
honestly feel if there's one day of the
year we can just go like all out with
your makeup it is New Year's Eve why not
look a bit different from I think are
lookin is that same concealers before
the Rimmel wake me up concealer and I'm
just gonna pop that under my eyes so I
was thinking of doing full drugstore
today - and lashes and her lashes are
really joke at all but I was thinking of
doing this because I actually have been
using a lot more drugstore makeup since
moving to England and if you guys do
want me to make more drugstore are in
the tutorials and more than happy to do
that because it's kinda like what I
started doing if it wouldn't rain around
for that long just honestly be like oh
my god one day I might I'm like mac
makeup or something amazing like that
and then here we are
I was drugstore Queen back then I still
have jobs still makeup I just haven't
used it for some reason as much my
tutorials though there we go
sooo that is done we're gonna grab a
powder I'm gonna use the maybelline
superstay 24-hour powder and it's gonna
grab a powder brush I'm gonna go ahead
and start to buff that on my skin this
is giving us the coverage and also kind
of blending all those skin products
together as well and I totally didn't
use a primer today oh you should
probably use a primer if you don't use
it make it look
I did use a moisturizer but I forgot to
pry much my eyes too much but yeah he's
a pro I've got one out everything I was
gonna use the NYX pore filler what
something else do you that they're just
like halfway done with their makeup
routine they just got like a really
obvious product it's like oh it's bones
are actually ice first or bronzer lest
you bronzer and then we'll finish up the
eyes why can I not stop eating oh my god
I'm gonna speak Rimmel Sun she met
bronzer this is like a golden oldie
absolutely face of mine I was gonna
start by being on my cheekbones and then
blending it upwards and outwards and
it's always got to drag down to neck
also make sure that you're all the same
color as well that's always bonus and
then from the NYX born to glow part were
actually using this for a highlight -
I'm just gonna look I'm gonna grab the
shimmery bronzer shade and I'm just
going to pop that over the top just to
deepen it a little bit more and add a
bit of a shimmer - or die - now for the
fun part so we're going to highlight I'm
actually gonna mix the white and golden
shades together cuz it's actually not a
warm look - no but I've done oh my god
I'm actually using cool tones Who am I
and what am I done with Danny so it's
gonna pop that mix of the two
oh that's good looks at the two
highlights on my cheekbone I've actually
never used that before but boy kids
really nice it's like it's subtle which
is nice it's not too overpowering and
very blendable go Nick this is really
good so we're gonna actually do the lips
first to get them out of the way and
then we will do the under eyes but I'm
loving the fact that this is coming out
so nicely with drugstores let me just
grab some sweets cuz I
so I'm gonna Jamil it's no I literally
can't decide what color but this is
really nice this is a NYX cosmetic metal
metal lip cream which I've never you
before I'm gonna go ahead and just apply
some lip light onto my lips with a NYX
lip liner I'm sure you can tell the fact
that I love Nick since moving here it is
such a good company right so my lips
have some shape it some definition to
them now it's here really go either way
really good but maybe with it see what
happens it doesn't work out well then we
could something else I over the top
let's do it
I like it this is cool we like much just
like the eyes really well cause like
listening this is always along by Nick
sartorial isn't it like he's have a
really good stuff
OSs do we like it or do we like it hey
it worked
anything okay so that's a win one more
sweet for me and then we're going to do
what under eyes so from the NYX ultimate
shadow palette I'll use of this shade
once again here and just pop that on the
lower lash line strange this up and make
it more purple in here oh yeah now it
actually matches the makeup I've no idea
where I heard it set to yellow no idea
what I do I don't even know and I'm
gonna go ahead grab that really dark
purple shape from the fire pellet and
really tight line that above the other
purple shade you know I might actually
put a little bit of silver here and here
kind of much everything else so I'm
gonna grab that pigment oh god I know
you spilt that everywhere I'm gonna
anyway that's pigment again put a little
bit glue on it and pop it underneath my
eyes
