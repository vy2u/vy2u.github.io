today I'm doing a really easy 5-minute
drugstore back to school makeup tutorial
I love this look it is so easy and it is
so affordable so it's perfect and it
doesn't take long at all
this look is slightly different than my
last back to school makeup tutorial this
one is a teeny bit heavier it's still
very very very natural-looking but my
old back school toriel was super natural
because when I was at school I wasn't
know how to wear makeup so I didn't
realize how many of you are there to a
makeup school so this is my impression
of what I would wear to school if I were
allowed to wear makeup I really hope
that you guys enjoy the tutorial and
let's jump straight into it so here I am
in all my makeup look sorry we're gonna
start with the Maybelline fit me
foundation I'm actually using the dewy
one today because here's a bit more of a
natural finish and the matte one and
this foundation is amazing it lasts all
day so I would definitely recommend it
for you guys now with the covergirl
Ready Set gorgeous concealer I'm just
gonna put this under my eyes I know at
school you guys probably been up all
night watching Netflix or on tumblr so I
would definitely recommend this step to
make you look a little bit more awake
and concealer is done just to set the
under-eye concealer as we do have long
school days I'm using the yellow banana
powder from the Australis I see on tour
a contour kit and I'm just setting this
under my eyes only
and then just quickly at lining my lips
with the colour-pop BFF liner now with
the car pop bronzer called carrion I'm
just gonna lightly dust this along my
cheekbones the trick to this is that you
want to look really natural to avoid any
really harsh orange bronzers you want to
keep it as natural as ich and the
schools though this one worked really
well and my little tip is use it in your
crease and it makes a really cool
eyeshadow effect as well now setting
everything with my Australia's fresh and
flawless powder I'm just gonna dust this
very lightly over my face so that it
ensures that it will stay on all day
and using my Maybelline lash sensational
I'm just going to pop on some mascara
onto my lashes this mascara is
incredible it's so good and it just
makes my lashes so long I mean look at
that difference thank you guys so much
for watching this tutorial today I hope
you enjoy the look and please let me
know if you decide to try it out for
school or work or just an everyday look
I'd love to know if you guys enjoyed it
so let's have a chat in the comments and
until next time guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
