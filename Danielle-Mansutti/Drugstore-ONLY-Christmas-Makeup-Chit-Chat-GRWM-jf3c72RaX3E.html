today's video I have done a drugstore
only a Christmas makeup tutorial this
look is so simple and so easy and
something I went a hundred percent way
through Christmas I know all of my
tutorials I try and like make them look
a little bit like fancy whatever but
this is just so me and so simple so I
really hope you guys enjoy it and let's
jump straight into it my hats gonna fall
up so I just realized that my microphone
wasn't on there so he was talking about
that I'm just buffing it all into my
skin with the zoeva buffer brush it's so
good guys I love it next I'm using the
Rimmel wake me up concealer and I'm
going to use this underneath my eyes I'm
just using this in a little triangle
shape underneath my eyes so we got it
down and then you only got it in my eye
then so once you are absolutely covered
in consumer lets blend it out no it's
with my makeup bases today I keep
pulling really ugly mouth faces I know
why this brush it's just like instantly
replaced my love for the beauty but uh I
think I have things where I like I hate
makeup brushes and then I go to the
Beauty Blender only you know I'm in that
things like bullrushes yeah okay I am
completely concealed up now so I'm going
to apply powder over the top and my
favorite drugstore one is the if it
wants to add the focus the Rimmel stay
matte powder I'm just using this with a
big fluffy brush and applying it on my
face
my makeup always comes off on my
forehead like at the very top I always
get like a white line towards him in the
day so that's why I'm packing on like a
whole lot of stuff on now time to fill
in these bad boys I'm going to use the
Maybelline brow precise pencil did I
have one of my dog's hair it's got on it
but well that's just something to it
I'm just going to start from the tail
and working my way outwards so now to
give our cheekbones some definition
we're going to use this NYX Beach
favorite blush it is so gorgeous
no actually so much it's a bronzer oops
but we're gonna use this bronzer on our
cheeks I'm going to grab a big fluffy
brush and work it just up and down my
cheekbone and then I'm just gonna go and
blend it out and I'm once it's mostly
blended out on the side I'm also going
to add it up to my forehead and then
just blend that too this just creates a
little more of a slimming effect on your
face it's all like nice and sculpted and
on this side it's like where's your
cheekbone now it's time for the scary
part I'm using the covergirl intensify
me liquid eyeliner and most could go
really well or really bad on camera so
what's up - I see so my aim is just to
have a really cute wing I guess
everybody
I hate doing this on camera especially
when I'm talking it's like division so
hot I'm gonna like disappear a little
bit cuz once I close my Marisol he has
yes I'm 21 I know I have to recreate it
on the other side
zabi I wanted to turn out a little bit
way more like woe than what I wanted but
we're just gonna roll with it we're
gonna wing it to get it but um so now
we're gonna move on to lashes and I'm
going to use the models prefer bold and
beautiful high-impact mascara Lister so
are you guys like getting super excited
for Christmas
I definitely I'm gonna be over in the UK
for Christmas it just sucks family so
excited I'm gonna be up north and then
all right New Year's I'm going down
south so so how many of you guys are
watching from the Northwest or North
East of England because we may bump into
each other around Christmastime it's so
exciting
but I don't know what it is I know that
I would if this so long now but a real
Christmas to me is still in English
white Christmas I just don't know having
Christmas in summer year it's just so
weird it's just not Christmas because it
runs more excited about summer than they
are about Christmas so I'm not going to
take this Rimmel London it's scandalize
what's it called an eyeshadow stick and
I'm actually gonna put it in my
waterline
I'm going like although out to my tear
duct and then putting it in my inner
corner as well for my blush today I'm
using the face of Australia Oh peachy
blush and I'm just going to get it on so
to talk with the blush face I don't know
if I should do false lashes or not I
mean like if this were like my Christmas
day I probably wouldn't say maybe I
shouldn't put on false lashes but feel
free if you want to put on false lashes
to go ahead and put in some false lashes
that's trying to go choice kay the
highlight I'm going to use the color pop
electric slide super shock cheek
it is so good I know that sorry boys
guys check that car pop is super
affordable like so affordable so I
definitely recommend them if you only
like spending a little bit of money on
your makeup like me so what do we have
left I think I might just keep this
really simple and just do lips next in
that it because I feel like I don't know
let's just not go too crazy this time my
lips I'm using the Loreal color riche
riche 3717 perfect red and I can't use a
lip liner because we're only lip liners
aren't dressed perfectly yeah it's good
it's up too much but this is a gorgeous
color I love it
so here is the finished look I think I'm
going to keep it nice and simple and
easy for Christmas I love doing
drugstore in the tutorials it's so much
fun and please let me know if you'd like
to see more drugstore in these tutorials
in the future and of course if you do
recreate this look please use the
hashtag Pham city on Instagram so I can
find you and you'll like and give you
lots of love and virtual hugs so ever
you guys have a great Christmas and in
doing this makeup tutorial and I'll see
you really soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
