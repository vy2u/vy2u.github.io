today I have a Priceline haul for you
guys which is a drugstore here in
Australia
Priceline occasionally has a 40% of all
cosmetics haul and when I see it I go
crazy
however this haul is not as big as some
other bigger hauls because I did limit
myself to only spending about $90 I
didn't want to go like crazy so I ended
up spending about $80 which is still so
much money and I'll show you everything
that I bought and I'm so not used to
doing hauls I've done like one haul ever
on my channel which was for chichi and I
don't even buy that stuff so yeah I
haven't actually done a haul from stuff
I bought before I used to feel like
hauls very like showing off and being
like but you guys say you enjoy watching
them so I'm doing it for you guys today
yeah so basically when I show you these
products now they're gonna Stewie in
their packaging but the close-ups will
be not in that packaging I haven't
actually used any of the products yet
but once I do the close-ups which I'll
do after filming this you will see what
it looks like without the packaging on
it woah
and so the first thing that I saw as
soon as I walked into price I know it
was this bad boy right here which you
guys know that I already have
it's the Australia's AC on tour
contouring and highlighting kit I am
running out of the banana powder so I
decided by the whole kit for the banana
powder because I use it all the time and
it's like my favorite thing in the whole
world
Australia so you need to bring out a
separate banana powder please and I'll
buy 50 million of them got my little or
estate out world big receipt so this
should have been 16 dollars 95
it was about $10 for the whole kit so I
was very happy that I saw these in stock
because I've really wanted that one for
a long time I really really really
really do not like the contrary shades
and that palette there's so money and
hard to blend but I love the
highlighting trades in that palette so
yeah ten dollars why not
the next thing that I picked up is
something I've seen all over YouTube
that is the Australia's fresh and
flawless power
and I got this in the shade darkest
Brown this says it's a quick touch-up
powder in a convenient compact for a
radiant matte complexion just to stop
shininess and whatever I usually hate
powders because it means that flash
photography is like white and stuff but
I can't see any SPF in this one so I'm
hoping no horrible white flash backs cuz
we all know how sexy this is $7 for that
powder well good at math hey so the next
thing that I picked up was something
that I used to have a long time ago but
I never really knew how to use it
properly but I've seen a lot of people
using it again so I thought you know
what I'll try it again I might have just
liked it the first time and that is the
Maybelline master precise liquid
eyeliner in the shade blackest black so
this would have been 15 dollars but I
got it for nine dollars in the sale I do
know that I did actually like this buy
think I lost or something I can't member
something weird story with that one the
master precise eyeliner is something I
see quite a lot and I don't really have
a favorite liquid eyeliner so I'm open
to trying lots of different liquid
Islanders to find the right one for me
oh my god I am actually worsen it
disguising stuff in the walls I'm just
like it's really good that's why I
bought it so this is the matte lipcream
and I believe it's in the shade Rio
that's all I can see it says rear D
matte lip so I'm not too sure if that's
the right shine it's a very orange E red
tone something really different I don't
really wear this kind of color so I
bought it because I thought you know
what I never really go for orange cuts
that I would be like oh my god orange so
I thought you know what I'll buy it
anyway and see how it is in tutorials I
heard so many different things about
this product some people love it and
some people absolutely hate it so it's
really difficult I don't know I'll see
what I feel like for myself but I have
had very mixed things about it and -
everybody's overseas the thing is
Australian makeup is normally almost
three times the price as US makeup so
this price but Aziz is amazing but you
know a drugstore
Foundation in America which costs you
$10 will costs $35 here and our dollars
not really that difference so it really
doesn't make much sense so this is why
I'm telling you guys the prices because
everyone in Australia but I caught my
god that's awesome the next thing I
picked up was a Maybelline lipstick I do
not own any Maybelline lipstick so this
lipstick is called 280 rum Ricci or rich
not too sure the correct pronunciation
of that one so this was originally 1695
but it got rid of 678 so pretty much $10
for this lipstick so just like the
Australis one it's a color that I don't
use or don't have so I thought instead
of just sticking to what I'm comfortable
with a constantly getting the same new
shades or the same red shades I thought
I will get something different because I
love doing very different tutorials for
you guys don't know I want to get stuck
in a right of doing the same tutorial
over and over and over and over again
this is why I got a lot of different
products and I was sad just buying stuff
that I'm comfortable with because I just
want to venture out to different
products so once again this product I've
seen all over YouTube I've seen so many
American youtubers uses product and they
say they absolutely love it and that is
the covergirl outlast stay fabulous 3 in
1 foundation and I got this in the shade
golden tan it says it's an all day
flawless coverage lasting power of
primer
coverage of a concealer and blend
ability of a foundation in one and let
it shine free so a lot to live up to
this foundation I have very high
expectations for this little guy I'm not
too sure if I got the right shade but I
think it's pretty bang on I mean my holy
grail is the Estee Lauder Double Wear so
if this comes anywhere close it is a
fraction of the cost so I hope it comes
a little bit closer I want to spend $50
on Estee Lauder every time I want to buy
it and so that foundation it was $19 95
and it was it had seven dollars 98 taken
off so it was about 1295 ish which is
awesome that's like a fifth of the price
of the sa lot of foundations
it's good the next product that I got is
something that you'll remember I used to
be obsessed with months ago like when I
first started YouTube which is the
L'Oreal True Match however I did buy
this in a different shade so I used to
be w3 I think it was called golden beige
but now I picked up w-4 which is called
golden natural and I've done this
because my old one was like my winter
foundation and now that I'm a fake tend
to really max all the time that I want
something a little bit different I
remember the best thing about this
foundation is how all of it is it's not
pink doesn't have any redness throughout
the foundation at all
it's very blendable however it gives you
the most ugly smile lines in the whole
world I guess oh I remember using this I
would walk around I would age about 20
years having these like big fat wrinkles
down the side of my mouth and I was like
that is really really sexy hey boys I'm
like 50 years old but I haven't eaten in
a long time so once I go back to using
it again then I'll let you guys know if
I like it again or if I still mmm about
how it dries and stuff that one was 2995
originally I got $11 98 taken off the
price so that's heaps taken off the
price so I'm very happy you paying that
much for that foundation because I used
to be obsessed with that foundation but
it's really hard because once you go to
high-end foundations after using
drugstore ones you can't go back to the
drugstore ones because you just keep
comparing to your high-end ones you're
like this is so much better and lucky
last is something I've never used before
but again I've seen on you all the time
which is the stay matte powder by Rimmel
this is in the shade silky beige and so
I pick this up because a lot of
youtubers have talked about it in their
videos or used it again I'm just I don't
think I've ever found the right powder
for me because I feel like powder washes
me out and makes me look lighter instead
of you know just evening out your face I
guess what we're talking about I've no
idea
I've seen this one talks about hate and
I thought I would give it a go hopefully
I don't have flash back as well it just
says it has up to five hours natural
shine control with natural minerals
helps minimize the appearance of pores
and
to be tested so I'm hoping it does not
have the beautiful SPF which makes me
look like a ghost with a brown body in
fire oh my god and that is my little of
priceline whole guys I know that it is
very small compared to a lot of other
girls I hate spending a lot of money
unless I'm really after anything but $1
for me to spend oh Christ I need heat
that's so much money so I don't want a
girl like terribly stopping by so much
product but we should be away sitting at
my make up drawers I bought stuff but I
actually want to use and just get the
most out of and all kind of stuff and
also I feel like buying more drugstore
products will make me want to do more
drugstore tutorials because I know you
guys love a drugstore tutorials also I
know that most products are Australian
only but I do have one Australian
viewers so it's kind of like a hard one
because I know half of you like well
that's really not as Danny but I can't
buy it but that's how I feel when I
watch American or English videos so yeah
anyway I still like that you enjoyed the
video so casual just sitting in my room
whatever it's a really fun video to film
so I hope you guys have an amazing week
and I'll be seeing you really soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
