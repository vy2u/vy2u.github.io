we are doing a very very fun video it's
a very affordable and effective everyday
makeup shot on this whole look he's
under 30 pounds in total so it's an
absolutely gorgeous sunny day today so I
thought I would sit and film my lounge
it said it with my studio lights and I
really like filming in like a homely
space so just gives a different vibe to
the video sort of like with the studio
stuff because it can I come across a
little bit like flat to me I guess
filming with a white hope you would like
to see how to achieve that this natural
everyday makeup look for under 30 pounds
then please keep watching what we're
going to use today is the l'oreal true
match foundation this is an absolute
golden oldie of mine
this is like the ogia when I sell my
channel I used for this all the time so
this one is in the shade for n beige and
I have got quite a dark color only
because my fake tan is what this is just
such oh my god how does that even happen
I don't understand this we go ahead and
blend this in with my Beauty Blender I
always prefer using a sponge for liquid
rather than a brush and also as you saw
I've got a ton of breakouts the minute a
ton of redness my skin is just
misbehaving so much right now I'm trying
to figure out what the cause is
I think it's because I reintroduce dairy
a little bit to my diet and now my whole
face is like that's why I picked a
foundation which is really really really
nice coverage as well because true much
as you can see it's like your skin bit
clearer and better which is what we want
I literally feel like transformed why
foundation on so we're gonna conceal now
I'm gonna use the Maybelline fit me
concealer and this one is in 20 but I'm
gonna definitely need some of these
spots because they are just like why
it's just amazing what a tiny bit of
foundation can do get self-confidence
like before I can even look at my skin
now
and they love my beep line once again
I'm SHINee's that to blend in the
concealer I'm just doing it in that look
like triangle shape yeah because we
don't want to go too far with it
although it wouldn't hurt a little bit
on this spot on this one sitting on my
skin in place we're gonna use the
Primark insta go banana powder which my
hair add is actually amazing it's insane
how good my much makeup is actually
linking a cath you guys above if you
haven't seen my trying Primark makeup
video I was just like shocked it is good
but it is some good stuff and I was not
expecting that and for my brows I'm
gonna be using the Primark brow pomade
it's better than aviation my opinion
like it's so good but it just glides on
and just like that I actually feel like
myself again of course if you are
blessed with naturally gorgeous eyebrows
which I was not you can skip that step
and save some money in the process but I
was not born fantastic so I always have
to fill my name this is the collection
fast stroke defining a lash I have not
used this before but it was the only
thing I could kind of find within budget
and I have tried other collection and
makeup before and it actually liked it
but this is what the wand looks like and
let's see that goes to being honest
that's not bad that's actually pretty
good it's quite decent for that price is
really I wasn't expecting too much but
it's actually really nice oh god once my
lashes are done it feels so much better
makes me so happy having my life
I did find this bronzing and
illuminating compact and on the inside
we have a bronzer and then we also have
a highlight and like kind of like a
highlighter bronzer so I'm gonna have to
find a way to try not to get them oh god
hello focus what are you doing so I'm
gonna try my best not to mix and match
them all together and actually get each
one to do its purpose so because I have
never had this one before I just really
wanted to give it a road test see how it
is sooo let's go ahead and bronze
ourselves so I'm just gonna make sure
that my brush isn't touching the other
side because you don't wanna be too
glowy
so I think the one word I used to
describe that is subtle it's very
natural which is always a great thing as
well for an everyday makeup look you
don't want to go too overboard because
we still want to look like ourselves
just enhance it is very subtle but it is
actually quite nice and natural as well
now with this illuminating side on the
top I'm gonna grab that with a fan brush
no I don't contour my nose but I'm still
gonna pop a little bit down my nose
anyway just to kind of illuminate and
try make it look a teeny bit straighter
and then under the brow and over here
think what I might do quickly is grab a
big blending brush like this one which
is a Sigma tapered e-40 blending brush
i'm actually gonna pop it in the bottom
two here i'm gonna go ahead and pop this
right there just to add a little bit
more depth i feel like there is
something missing and I thought perhaps
its eyes that's already opening up my
eye a little bit adding more depth and
dimension to the face because it can
look quite flat otherwise so I'm just
going to go ahead and pop it on this out
to
and of course in order to bring this
whole look together it is lift time and
I was really intrigued by this product
it's a two-in-one lipstick liner by the
natural collection so I found them in
Boots and I thought the colors are
really really pretty really subtle and
really natural which is exactly what we
are looking for today and I'm just gonna
put it on like a liner but I'm also
gonna put it around my lips with it both
say it's a lipstick liner that says lime
define and then color lips so we're
gonna do all three with this one product
can I just say this liner is so creamy
and glide herbal like it's a dream it
was so creamy I let you glide on so well
so mmm it doesn't have like a shade cut
I can see oh wait pink petal is the name
of the lip liner but seriously that
glided on like an absolute dream and I
love how it looks on the lip I love the
color I love everything like that is
that is a hidden gem that is amazing so
now that the lips are done with the
whole look is complete and I'm just
blown away with how effective and how
affordable and how amazing this is like
it least she would take me under five
minutes
especially if you'd open your eyebrows
it will take about 30 minutes like it's
just so easy and so good so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and let me know
if you like the vibe of just sitting in
my lounge room I love it personally I
love like inviting you into my home
you're just sitting here and sharing
some beauty tips
it's just what YouTube is all about so I
hope you guys have a brilliant week and
until next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
