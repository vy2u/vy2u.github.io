today I am doing a whole video but it's
a little bit different so I hope you
appreciate what I found for you because
it is amazing I have my boss here and
what the website cool so the name of the
website is shop miss a dot-com and
absolutely everything in this box was
one dollar like seriously it was one
dollar every single item in here I can't
believe that I actually got all this
stuff for a dull age it is absolutely
insane and because you guys know how
much I love my bargains it's just
amazing so I think this is a really
great idea because christmas is coming
up and especially for us girls in
Australia the stuff that's in here we
pay for like $10 each sometimes some of
them maybe even $15 each so that's good
still I don't know I haven't unboxes yet
so I'm so excited to start looking
through all the products so firstly I
have got some eyelashes I did sort of
cheat a little bit I are wearing so I'll
just put a like identical to this one so
as you can see this eyelash brand is so
natural looking I really don't like the
eyelashes which have the big thick black
rubber band thingy on the top these ones
are very natural um next I have got this
which is a little headband I thought
it's very cute color oh so it's like me
no so no this isn't gonna work me right
now I'm just gonna sit there like a cool
little does this look please I'll figure
out how to put this on something yes
next I have got quite a few elf brushes
because on this website - they have like
all the Elfie of the of products the
brushes that cosmetics everything in
Australia we get help from came out and
it is still cheap but I mean imagine
getting a lots of $4 thick so I've got a
few little brushes here
I have my concealer brush my smudge
brush and a powder brush I think the
biggest thing about elf cosmetics as
well is that they are so good for their
price don't understand why elf is so
cheap but their brushes are such good
quality as you guys know I use this one
quite a lot this is the elf flawless
concealer brush I don't have autofocus
on my camera I'm sorry I have like a
really older camera but excited to try
these out because I really really
recommend elf for people like me who
don't like spending money this is the
natural lash kit from elf and this is
the brightening eye college is a very
little palette I mean these do have that
black band which I hate but we will see
how they look mochi ish I power to try
out too so yeah cool so it's not just
cosmetics and beauty and all the stuff
that they do they also do quite a lot of
accessories so I decided to go and enjoy
myself some accessories and everything
is individually wrapped which is great
because then I know that it's not just
been like chopped in a box and just you
know damaged so I got this really cute
little like golden bangles which I
should totally put on because I think
that they would suit this whole garden
look gone up I've also got this necklace
which has a cute little owl on the
bottom so like a turquoise I see
rhinestone thanks real cute and then I
have a bird necklace a very long golden
necklace and I think that necklace would
look so good with like a black long
sleeve knitted sweater
it would look awesome I also have this
black necklace here very cute on what I
guess yeah I can you tell I'm not much
of an accessories person I'm like and
yeah then I have this little hearing I
bought to put on my car keys because I
think it is so so cute and
I just love it I mean I'm not even like
halfway yet and considering that
everything that you seen so far I got no
ten items or something
sounds like ten dollars that's just oh I
get my head around it because you guys
know that I'm all about my bargain so
it's so great to find website like this
because I'm not going to shove in your
face by this Naked palette by this
frigging nas not to face stuff because I
can't afford it so maybe one day in the
far future I will have enough money to
go and walk into Mac and not be
terrified and walk the other way yeah
hopefully one day I will be able to get
those products but for now this is
perfect for me so I'm sure all of you
would really like this website too which
is why I'm doing a video on it so yeah
another elf product I have the
correcting concealer and this is in the
color beige I think it's sort of hiding
what the color name is but I think it's
beige cut some friendship bracelets cuz
you know why not I'm gonna give one that
to my boyfriend and friends only if only
I can give all of you guys a friendship
bracelet oh dear God I would love to
give you guys French person something so
cute I love these that's so pretty
I think I'm going to put this on now
well soon because this is gonna take me
forever working hard put on oh my got
some pretty earrings I think these are
my favorite earrings they are so so cute
these liking little garden leaves they
are very very very cute and then I've
got another pair which is just sort of
another gardener earrings can you tell
that I prefer gold over silver jewelry
this one is like an ear cuff um to put
on the top of a and then to come
sandwich very cute and this one's so
cute this is a little elephant necklace
I think it's just the cutest thing ever
so adorable so I'm definitely going to
probably wear this one today so much
jewelry I've still got some fun cover
- you just post you know why not
and they Raptors all which is really
cute as you can see I have a podcast
that's all like smudged and ripped off
because I paid $5.00 for it
surprise looks like that that's really
pretty actually like this this is really
cute this is a lot better than my one
and it has a little um it has a little
love heart I think this is really good
this is really really really cute I
really like this phone cover meeting so
excited for a one dollar phone cover oh
my god this is a cute little ring it's
like a little infinity symbol on it they
don't have the lengthening and defining
the scar from elf and I think it is the
last product is a makeup little cute
makeup cake with a sequin case I'm so
excited with this I think this is so
good like fully affordable affordability
that isn't even a word yes so this is
some really great stuff for the price
that you pay and because you know that I
love my bargains I would so recommend
this website I think it's good as well
that I can help you guys with what I
would want to see if I was watching a
video because sometimes I watch a whole
video and they're just going on about I
got like 500 products from Mac and I'm
just like well good for you but I'm
never gonna be able to afford that so
why am i watching this like this is just
stupid ah rant angry thoughts no
hopefully one day I will be rich enough
to buy a mac lipstick so we'll see I
just thought that I would do this video
on our surprise Sunday because I have
been loving everything on YouTube at the
moment and I've just been like I want to
feel more and as you guys know I film on
Tuesdays and Fridays but I've just
thought why not film more because I have
been working this week but I've just
been wanting to film so much I'm just
like addicted to it now I just love it
it's like really weird talking to you
guys on a Sunday but I hope that you
enjoy a Sunday night and if you go to
school tomorrow I feel really bad for
you I'm glad I'm not you I hope you guys
have had a good weekend and
this little surprise for video expect
