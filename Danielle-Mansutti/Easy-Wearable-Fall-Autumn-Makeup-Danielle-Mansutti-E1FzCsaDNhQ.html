covergirl outlast stay fabulous
foundation mine is in the shade golden
tan and the whole purpose of this makeup
look is more of like a daytime wearable
look rather than a really dramatic fall
look like all my other ones and
continuing oh my god
using my Beauty Blender just to blend
everything into my face can't go wrong
with a Beauty Blender it is the best I'm
using my broken Australis fresh and
flawless powder which I still love even
though it's broken I'm just gonna apply
this all over my face with a big fluffy
brush just to set for my skin makeup I'm
also gonna blend it down to my neck to
make sure we don't have any cakey makeup
lines as well I'm using the deep dark
brunette fluid lines brow gel cream by
Mac on my brows and hello uninvited
pimple how are you I'm just using this
on my brows just to fill them in
moving on to the vice palette by urban
decay I'm using the shade downfall on my
crease with a fluffy brush from makeup
geek I believe so I'm just using this in
my crease back and forth back and forth
back and forth and blending it through
so that we have a nice transition shade
then I'm moving on to this beautiful
shade called Sonic everything a flat
brush and I'm just applying this all
over the lid
I'm going back in with a fluffy brush
just to make sure that everything is
blended in together and then I'm also
gonna use that fluffy brush on my lower
lash line to continue the eyeshadow down
there now using a last sin I'm just
placing this on way in a corner for a
bit of a highlight and then I'm using
the Too Faced better than sex mascara on
my lashes just before we apply falsies
what are you doing daddy so now I'm just
gonna put on some a black eyeliner in my
waterline this is the Eye of Horus got a
smokey eye pencil and I'm just putting
this in my waterline just to ensure that
it's nice and dark
now I'm using the car at wispy lashes on
my eyelashes and oh I struggle doing
this on camera using the Bahama Mama
bronzer which is my current favorite I'm
using this on my cheekbones but this is
a very dark bronzer so I'm making sure
to blend it out as much as I possibly
can to just make sure it doesn't look
muddy on my face at all I'm also popping
a bit under my chin and then up to my
temples in my forehead as well I'm also
gonna put a little bit down my nose just
to make it look a little bit skinnier
using the matte gold deposit and then
going over that bronzer just to make
sure it looks very luminous and glowy
and now using hot mama by the bum this
is just a nice nice nice blush and I'm
just gonna put this on my cheekbone just
to give me a flush of color
using colourpop's chili chili a liquid
lipstick and popping this onto your my
lips and it is a gorgeous shade I'm
currently obsessed with his lip color
I sort of revolved the whole look around
it and easy is that that is the finished
look for the wearable fold I really hope
that you guys enjoyed this it's more of
like an easygoing daytime full look and
I'll see you guys by name using the mix
roll on shimmer and I'm just starting
this on my forehead because it is a
festival get ready with me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
