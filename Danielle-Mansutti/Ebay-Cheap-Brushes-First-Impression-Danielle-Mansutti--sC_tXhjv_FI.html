channel today I have done my first
impressions of some beautiful pink
brushes I got from eBay the cheap
knockoff brushes which everyone seems to
hate but I decided to try them anyway in
this video I do my full face with these
brushes I tell you if I love them or if
I hate them because I bought it with my
own money sorry I'm not representing
anyone or anything like that so what I'm
saying is the truth and so if you enjoy
watching my first impressions video
today then please let me know because it
was fun to film something different but
I am a bit brain-dead today because I've
been very faint all week so I'm sorry if
my head and my mouth don't connect in
the speaker but I was just sort of like
oh yeah that's pretty much it
I hope you enjoyed it today and let's
get straight into it so I have done my
eyebrows and my mascara I'm just gonna
be using the brushes for my face makeup
today and I'm trying to look which one
will be the best to apply foundation
with and all four of these sort of facie
ones I know this one's more of a powder
one so we're not gonna do that one okay
so I'm just going to try first with this
one and see how it go okay
the brush itself feels really soft to
the point where I don't really know if
it's doing anything it's like hey I'm
comparing all of us this is my holy
grail brush at the moment is the Real
Techniques buffing brush even though we
shouldn't use this for foundation I find
it works really great so I'm comparing
when I put this on my face it feels like
it's doing more how to explain this one
just feels like bit me yeah the whole
reason for this is that I am a big money
saver and I saw these brushes on eBay
for $30 for the whole packet and I was
like whoa so I said buy them sorry that
I'm not really giving much detail but
it's quite shiny and yeah it's not
actually I do feel though that these
brushes would get steeper daily quickly
because they are not that great quality
I mean I've just done one pump and it is
already gone from that color to this
color in one pump which is pretty
ridiculous
I guess that these aren't synthetic so
so as you can see the foundation is now
on I'm quite happy with the way that it
looks
it has blended in quite well so I'm just
going to go ahead and use one of the
little brushes just to see how it works
with concealer maybelline superstay 24
concealer
I just pops out under my eyes and I
always like freaked out when I watched
videos and girls you so much conceal and
I'm like you're wasting so much money
yeah so I only use a tiny bit and I just
try my best to blend it around
everywhere okay this brush is gonna get
out pretty nicely
there's no yucky brush bumpy marks or
anything and what I like about these
brushes as well I like the fact that
they're so long because I hate having to
hold a brush like this cause my face but
this one I can let you like this see it
I love it that's good so I'm just gonna
go ahead and try contouring with the
brushes because why not i don't have
auto focus i'm sorry i'm just gonna dip
this in my bronzer and i like the fact
that this brush stays hard when you put
it down if it doesn't just become a soft
it in it stays at the one shade so I'm
just gonna try and do my contouring with
this brush a little here just this one
black better know what is the word it's
not brush it's what
buff it out a Danny Logan can you tell
that I'm like completely brain-dead
today I just been having the most week
about sorry I'm going to go ahead and
use the diss brush which doesn't have a
name but you know it looks like looks
like this and I'm gonna use this for my
translucent powder I'm using the face
metallic powder okay I do not like this
brush okay I'm not gonna sweat going
with this one it feels nicer which is a
flat top brush and I'm just going to try
this with the powder instead
yeah woohoo so I'm just gonna pop this
around my face I'm really sorry if I
sound like really stupid today very
brain-dead I'm hurt right
well this brush is really nice actually
feels really good on my skin and it
seems to be doing its job quite well I
just wish there was a bigger brush I
wish there was a massive brush which I
could disease because I wish that there
was some way with translucent powder
where you could just get a gun and just
press it that's just put on your face
cuz then it would save so much time
translucent powder is an amazing product
but oh my god is it a pain to apply okay
so um my nudity and I will use this sort
of golden shade with the brown shade
just something a bit natural for this I
literally don't want to make it a really
bold eyeshadow I just want tiny little
tiny little bit just to give me a tiny
bit of definition so I'm gonna use this
brush which looks a little bit like a
blending brush and I'm just going to go
and do it straight onto my crease and
see what happens so there isn't much
product coming off whatsoever with this
brush
yeah yeah so it's just not really doing
much at all
the I'll try and use a dark color to see
if it's just the pigment of my eyeshadow
no all right so this brush talks and the
story it's not really doing anything for
me I put on a lot of product on this
brush and it's just that's why I'm not
gonna use falsies today because it's
just about the brushes so I'll just
mascara so overall I'm quite happy with
the way that the brushes have blended
everything out don't really have huge
problems or anything with this look so
would I recommend these brushes yes if
you are like me and you are tired ass
and you don't have that much money to
spend on heaps of brushes and whatever
um then this is a great great way to
save money because I definitely know
that I will be using these again because
um yeah I'm quite happy with how it's
looking however there are quite a few
pushes I did not like but the majority
of them I do like so that outweighs it
anyway I don't really like the little
brushes so these brushes are a bit new
don't really like these ones but I do
like this one for contouring because it
was the pointy one worked really well
but these ones are a bit boring crap so
I think these brushes as well I think
that they are absolutely gorgeous I love
the fact that they're pink because
finding paint brushes is like impossible
and I do really like how it has a really
large handle I guess you would say the
brush there I do not have a direct link
to the brushes that I got because they
were just from eBay I do think that they
come they fall under the name of and I'm
probably gonna be wrong
so I like Jessup just stop just soup
other day it's j es su P and I know that
a lot of girls get that from eBay it's
pretty much the same thing F colors
unlike baby blue and purple and white
and gorgeous colors and the very cheap
but I did find that these took a long
time to get delivered to me because I
bought them in July and it's now midway
through August so even though Australia
and China quite neighbors it did take
quite a long time so if you live in
America
it may take even longer so hopefully
find a country which is a little bit
closer if you need an alternative to
expensive brushes I would definitely
recommend these so I'm sorry that I was
a bit brain-dead today and looked a bit
thoughtful but I'm just a bit yeah I'll
see you guys on Friday with a hair
tutorial until next time guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
