channel in today's video I've done
something very different I know you guys
wanted to see a very colorful look for a
long time so I hope I do not disappoint
I use the Urban Decay vice reloaded
palette for this look today and as you
can see on the inside the colors in this
palette I like whoa
they're crazy this overyou 4 so bold and
they are storm pigmented as well and
really hope you guys do enjoy this a
makeup look and electronic toy today we
are starting with the soft ochre Pro
Longwear Paint Pot on our eyelids
students sure that we get the best color
pale from the palette
and then using the Sigma defuse crease a
38 brush then pairing this with the
color - and with - I'm just using it on
my crease for a transition shade
you
and now using this morphe brush with
this beautiful shake with 501 and
putting this in the outer corner of my
eye and I'm also extending it to the
inner corner of my eye and blending it
together this creates a little bit of a
halo effect but I'm leaving the middle
bit of my eye alone
and then I'm going in with UVB which is
such a gorgeous shade I'm using my
finger to pack this onto the middle of
my lid to create a little bit of a
gradient
you
just add a little bit more color I'm
using this show called mildew I believe
it's pronounced I'm using a 2 3 1 luxe
petite crease brush by zoeva and placing
this on my crease
and now using this amazing show called
asphyxia I'm now putting this in my
inner corner
I'm going back in with a 501 shade now
and I'm just going to go over the top to
add a little bit more darkness and drama
to my eye then using a makeup wipe I'm
going to clean up with a fall out and
then just fix it up with either a
foundation or concealer just following
the line from your lower lash line
upwards to create a really clean crisp
edge
now using the steel stay all day
waterproof liquid eyeliner I'm using
this to create a very simple winged
eyeliner
then using my bare minerals bare skin
concealer I'm using this to clean up any
mistakes with the eyeliner and dabbing
it through with my Beauty Blender then
using - once again with a pencil brush
I'm applying this to my lower lash line
going in with roller lash by benefit I'm
just applying a cart of this to my
lashes first just before applying the
flirt ice-pile lashes by Danny Beauty
store
and here the lashes up close they are
absolutely gorgeous my favorites I love
them so much and I'm just applying this
to my lashes to create more of a
dramatic effect and then we are done
thank you guys so much for watching this
tutorial today I really hope that you
enjoyed it and if you want to see any
more bold and colorful looks and please

create if you guys recreate this please
