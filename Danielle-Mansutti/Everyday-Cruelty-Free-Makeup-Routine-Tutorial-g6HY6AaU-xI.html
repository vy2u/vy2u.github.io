my channel today today is actually super
exciting because I've been doing a bit
of research to look into cruelty-free
brands and I was so pleasantly surprised
by the fact I use so much makeup which
is already cruelty free so I'm like damn
I stuff like to face of decay nose color
pop and assessment hills makeup think
that all cruelty free and that makes me
like so happy lately I have been using
just quality food products and I wanted
to show you how I do my everyday makeup
look using cruelty free products and
without further ado I will stop yappin
on and ho let's jump into it say I'm
going to start off with the Too Faced
Born This Way Foundation this one is in
the shade sand and I will be using a lot
of two-faced stuff today because it's
all cruelty free so just grabbing my
Beauty Blender I'm actually just going
to start by putting a pulp flat on my
face
like this and then I'm going to the lend
it into my skin and this sand color
matches my neck because I fake tan
that's why my face is like a million
change water because you're wondering so
as you can see we make my face in the
same color now yeah I'm looking
incredibly scary
it's and for those who can see that
never under the eyes to conceal I'm
going to use the Too Faced Born This Way
concealer this one is in the shade light
and I absolutely love how the bottle and
the concealer I like the same design
everything it is so cute I love it so
I'm just going to put this underneath my
eyes and this is a lot lighter than my
skin because I want this to be like a
bit of a highlight underneath my eyes if
that makes sense I'll also put it a bit
there is there grabbing my Beauty
Blender there going
lend this into our skin I was just
looking at my hands and my hands are
like so wide move out of my face I
should probably do something about that
I'm like fifty shades of white now
that's all blended let's get some
setting powder to put over the face to
set it all together my setting powder
which I always use if you are watching
my channel you know this is the NARS
pressed powder and guys I was so happy
when I found out that nails are cruelty
free which is so exciting because
they're a high-end product and they are
cruelty free so I'm going to use the
beach press powder all over my face and
I'm just going to a little light layer
over everything and then after this step
I'm going to move on to my eyebrows and
guess what guys anistar the about the
hills is cruelty free so I can use my
dip brow yes we're now moving on to
brows and I'm using the anastasia
beverly hills dipbrow and this is in the
shade dark brown so I actually seen that
a lot of BS youtubers have really jumped
on board with cruelty free makeup and I
was honestly thinking about it and I'm
like it's really not that hard to take
this which is it that's why today I'm
experimenting with using only cruelty
free products and we are only talking
about animal cruelty free products here
please don't have conversations and
arguments about food and diet and
veganism vegetarianism this is just
about quality food products I don't
really want there to be a huge
controversy in the comments you know
this is a positive thing that I'm trying
out so it'll be great if we could all
have positive vibes together guess who
has eyebrows again so I'm gonna be munch
of eyes and guess who was so happy to
find out that both Anasazi another hills
and makeup geek are cruelty free because
they are my Fuli drop today my favorite
eye shadows ever as you guys know so
today we are going to use this shake
here called flamethrower on the lid mix
it around with this one here called a
creme brulee
I'm going to take the flame for a shade
and I'm just packing this all over my
lid just keep it super super super
simple I've been loving this combo
lately and then I'm just going to take
that fluffy brush again and blend the
crease color with the lid color now with
this gold shade here by Oprah cosmetics
I'm just going to put that on my finger
and put it in my inner corner so like a
scary rabbit right now we're going to
put on some lashes mascara I'm using the
Too Faced better than sex mascara and
then we'll move on to the bottom lashes
in a second so I'm not to do the mascara
face right now has anyone mastered the
art of not having a mascara face because
if you have you are talented all right
so what mascara dry for a little bit
before I put on lashes or anything once
again a toothpaste product this is the
Too Faced cocoa contour palette day I'm
off I can not drop it on the football
I'm going to be using this shade here to
contour and the shade for underneath my
eyes Oh lighting change whoa what's
going on here back to filming with
natural light again and I remember it's
very hard to control one minute it's
stupid orange in here next minute it is
super blue and dark most going to bring
this up to my temples and my full hair
did all that stuff and now with that
same shade I'm going to contour my nose
I'm just going to run very quickly to my
notes I totally understand if you're
watching this in your life that's why
she much makeup everyday that's
completely fine if you want a more
natural look I'm happy to do that but
honestly like if I'm going out somewhere
shopping I will do this I love makeup I
love playing with makeup I love how you
can wake up one morning and be like Who
am I going to be today that's why I like
to wear quite a lot I guess like I wear
eyeshadow blushes and all that because
it's fun and I enjoy it so yeah so once
again I'm taking flamethrower from my
color
and I'm going to run this underneath my
eyes we're come through and you can use
a pencil brush for this I'm just being
super lazy and using the same brushes
before the kids I can't be bothered
watching two different brushes but
seriously it's like any Instagram photos
you see know me recently
I am always wearing this makeup look
like I'm obsessed with flamethrower so
beautiful I love it so I'm just going to
put a little bit of mascara on my bottom
lashes for my top lashes I'm going to
put on the ice by Luna lashes on top
these are absolutely perfect for
everyday use I love learner's so much
and I spy lashes are a hundred percent
cruelty free 100% synthetic so there is
no animals involved at all and to party
I'm going to use the Ardell glue which
is also call T free RL is cruelty free
which awesomes and I've changed my glue
if you use the Giro glue that is also
cruelty free
I also completely understand you guys a
bit like hey your eyes look very similar
to Friday's video but today's video is
just me showing you literally what I'm
doing every single day and using cruelty
free products I just love this eye
shadow color so much my promise after
this video I'll stop using it I
apologize but I loved it so much that
I'm like I'm sorry
just before we hop on to doing the lips
I remember in my last sort of like
everyday makeup look kind of thing I did
ask you guys to let me know where you're
from you guys are from all over the
world
obviously and it's so cool just knowing
that like this some of you in like
Germany and Sally Arabia and like these
are countries or to just like to me wow
someone in a country that knows who I am
it's really weird kind of thing it would
mean so much to me if you would also do
it on this video so if you could pause
now and let me know in the comments
where you're from that would be so cool
this is the colourpop lip pencil in Chee
I have top lips wet right now damn girl
okay can't talk about it
for the lipstick we are using
colourpop's
this is in the shade acro path I have
worn this like every single day this
month this really is like an everyday
makeup essential for me perfect nude it
lasts all day lasts you're eating or
drinking everything it's the best and
last but certainly not least is
highlight I'm using a Becca champagne
pop the Jack of the hill one and are we
ready for this
hey when I need to open it on the right
side fast when you travel on a speedboat
and you have your makeup bag on board
and it's a very choppy day you open up
your makeup bag and you see this
rest in peace shampoo I'm still using it
though like I'm so careful with it even
though it's smashed to smithereens I'm
just going to pop that highlight oh yeah
