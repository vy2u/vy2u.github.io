to be doing a very in-depth and
informative everyday makeup routine for
beginners this is just for people that
have no clue about makeup or it's for
people that do have a clue I'm wanting
to watch anyway that's fine you're all
welcome I was thinking like what would I
want to see in a video if I didn't know
how to do my makeup properly so I just
explained it in a lot of depth you guys
if there's anything at all that you are
unsure about or I don't cover them
please let me know at the end and ever
get back to you in the comments but I
really hope you enjoy this tutorial and
let's jump straight into it so here I am
all fresh-faced for me I've never found
a primer which is like amazing like I
need this problem every time I do my
makeup so I jumped straight into
foundation first for my foundation today
I'm using the Maybelline fit me matte
and poreless foundation I have the shade
three one zero which is Sun beige I know
pronounce to this three one ten ones but
it's three one zero and so cool us to
get started I have to put on this lovely
headband firstly with foundation there
are two ways around applying it which I
think are the most useful one thing I
really want to convey to you guys first
off is do not be restricted to using
brushes by what they say they use is for
for instance I use a contour brush for
my concealer so just see what works for
you and just go with that but personally
for my foundation the two things that
work really well for me are the morphe
m4 30 + 9 brush because it is such a big
fluffy brush just get the foundation all
around the face really evenly and it's
amazing and of course there is this
amazing tool called of a Beauty Blender
and the Beauty Blender is just amazing
it is loved by professional makeup
artists it
just really really great for a pine
foundation like evening up everything in
your skin it blends it it makes you look
airbrushed and perfect and it's awesome
however for my foundation today I will
use the morphe brush so this does not
have a pump it's always great to start
with a foundation that does have a pump
because then you know how much you're
using but what it doesn't have a pump
what I like to do is just put a little
bit on the back of my hand and then what
I do personally is that I take it up put
it in little dots on my face and then I
will blend it in with my brush and now
I'm just going to spread it around my
face in little dots like this but the
fun thing with makeup is that I feel
like it everyone applies it differently
and everyone finds our own little
techniques for oryx for them because
obviously we all are different faces
therefore it all works in different ways
when it comes to foundation a great tip
is to start from the middle and work
your way outwards and that way it looks
the most flawless and natural please
remember when it comes to foundation
that less is more you don't want to look
like you mentioned have a layer of thick
paint on your face because people know
how sexy that is remember it's always
great to blend it down to your neck
because or they want to be at least
appealing things that we could do is
leave a straight line here a massive tip
when choosing your foundation and
something that took a little while to
learn is when you're choosing your
foundation match it to your neck and not
your face my face naturally is a bit
more like white and pinky if I match my
foundation to my face I would have a
white pink face and a yellow neck so
yeah that wouldn't be appealing as I'm
about to assume you guys in and go onto
my brows for beginners I would
definitely recommend something like the
Maybelline brow precise shaping up
pencil like this one here this is great
because not only does it have a pencil
on one side but it has a spoolie brush
on the other snap zooms you guys are
nice and close so I'm gonna start using
the Explorer brush on this end and I'm
just going to brush
my eyebrows and give them a bit of a
guru so that they're all in its shape
with the pencil what I'm gonna do is
start from here in my eyebrow and then
work my way on the tail I'm going to
leave the front bit alone for a while
because we want that to look quite
natural where my tail is I'm just going
to follow that down and then extend it a
tiny bit like that I have quite a few
days missing in this region here so I'm
just going to fill them in as well so I
added a bit of product to my brow I'm
just going to go in again with this
fully brush and then just brush
everything through so the product is
evenly spread out within the brow I'm
gonna jump in with concealer I'm using
the Rimmel wake me up concealer this
does not have shade on it which is very
annoying so what I'm going to do with
this is just pop it underneath my eyes
and I'm gonna put it like this why I'm
not gonna put it in dots I'm just going
to put it this way and then I'm going to
blend it outwards so as you can see
right now I've put it in three little
stripes underneath my eye and what I'm
going to do is take my Beauty Blender
and I'm going to Pat it into my skin
like this and then drag it ours
and the purpose of doing this is that it
just brightens up your under-eye area
they're just comparing with my eyes now
you can see on this side I have quite a
glow and it's nice and awake and wide
and on this side it is a bit darker and
I do have a bit more of a shadow than I
do on this side so that's why I like to
use that concealer to avoid creasing on
your concealer it's always great to go
in with a powder and I absolutely love
this yellow shade here for underneath my
eyes and then if i zoom you in a room
all I'm gonna do is just have this
underneath my eye and then just give it
a bit of a wiggle and turn and a
squiggle and whiz and this really
prevents creasing it actually adds a
little bit more coverage and I just
absolutely love this trick it's amazing
it's time to set our foundation I'm
using this hurry damage to Stralis
flawless they look fresh and flawless oh
my god
Australis fresh and flawless pressed
powder on my skin and have a bit of an
accident and drop to this little guy on
the floor
so he's crumbled to bits but this is my
favorite drugstore powder any pressed
powder which is your skin tone would
work absolutely fine reason why I
include this step and would definitely
recommend it to you guys is that this
just ensures that your makeup will last
all day and not only that it just gives
a much more even flawless coverage to
your face don't want your brush little
looking like this if you can see there's
any excess on your brush just give it a
tap like that because otherwise you will
get that cake appearance on your face
and I'm just going to dab this onto my
skin and as you can see I'm not pulling
it I'm just dabbing it on top
I'm just zooming you up nice and close
and personal once again I I know that
this is a drugstore focused tutorial but
for eyeshadows I am using makeup geek
eyeshadows these are so affordable
anyway and honestly these are my
favorite eye shadows all-time or
definitely recommend looking into buying
them online because you can only buy
them online I believe they're extremely
pigmented which means it has a lot of
color payoff with some eyeshadows and
unfortunately a lot of drugstore
affordable eyeshadows when you dip your
brush into the eyeshadow and put it on
your eye there's hardly any color that
comes into your eye and that's the
pigment however with makeup akashi knows
they are very pigmented and I would
definitely recommend using these as a
starter just so that you can build up
your confidence with the eyeshadows
because they are great and they are
affordable so with your eye you have
your eye ball which sits here that line
there is your crease we use transition
shades so that it's not like a harsh
color from your lid to your skin color
this is the color which helps the
gradient to bring it all in together
this is a brush from a brand called
Sigma it is called a diffused crease be
thirty eight brush it is quite expensive
so I would recommend just looking at
stuff like elf because elf do stock
brushes like this I'm just going to dab
it into the eyeshadow like that and as
you can see there is a lot of product on
the brush we just tapped that away like
this just imagine I'm here in the car
and you put your windscreen wipers on
and it's going what we're gonna do is do
that same motion on our eyes just like
this here and don't worry if it gets
below this crease line I don't like to
go too far into here because I don't
like the effect that gives to my eye so
I'm just going side to side like this so
I'm stopping around the point where my
eyebrow ends and my iron so just right
here and what I'm gonna get towards the
end of my blending process and then use
my brush again but in this sort of
circular swirly motion and this just
helps to get rid of any harsh lines that
we've created with our brush
blend everything together now we've gone
to the lid which is just all of this
area here once again I'm using a makeup
geek eyeshadow I'm using a foil shimmery
eyeshadow it's called the starry eyed
and it looks like this and it's best to
use a flat brush you can just use your
thing is it's completely fine if we do
want to using fingers for this step I'm
not going to tap off my brush because I
do want a lot of the product to go onto
the brush and then I'm just gonna tilt
my head back like this so I can actually
see in my mirror dab this onto my eye
like this I'm not dragging it across my
eye I'm just going to Pat it onto my eye
like this and just add as much as you
want I'm just gonna add this a little
bit more and my last step for eyeshadow
is just using an eyeshadow like this
this is also from makeup geek and it's
called shimmer shimmer and what we're
going to do with this is place it right
underneath our eyebrow just here this is
an awesome thing to do it gives your
eyebrow business by a little bit of a
highlight and I'm going to just place
this underneath my eyebrow like this and
you can see just gives a really cool
effect and it is now I'm going to add
some mascara just to open up my eyes I'm
using the Maybelline lash sensational
mascara this is a great mascara because
I find that it really lengthens my
eyelashes when it comes to mascara I
like to start in the middle and I don't
go outwards what I do is I actually go
the other way I sort of go a little bit
inwards and I also wiggle and give a
little bit of a wiggle when I go up
because it actually helps to separate my
eyelashes as we go so as you can see I'm
just going to go like this give it a bit
of oil and then go towards the inner
part of my eye I'm also going to go
ahead and add a little bit to my bottom
lashes as well so now our eyes are done
it's time to move back onto the face I'm
going to use the NYX beach babe bronzer
and I'm going to use this with a very
very very big fluffy brush this is
of the m4o to brush any big puffy brush
is fine I just like this one so I always
like to stick to shades which are not
orange they're more Brown
I found that orange warm bronzers can
look a bit on balloon for some time so
it's best to stay with more like a
neutral Brown like this one and we're
not gonna be a contouring to know
anything like that because I do feel is
a little bit of best but if you do want
to see a beginner's guide like a contour
routine I'm more than happy to do that
but we're just amuse bronzer right now
for a substitute so I'm going to focus
on stopping around here so sort of for
the middle of your eye if you just
follow that line down your face you
should stop around there so don't bring
the runs are in any further than that
because it just doesn't look natural so
another thing you can do is just stuck
in your cheekbones like this and then
that's how you'll find your cheekbone
but you can just normally feel where
your cheekbone is and you want to just
learn that bronzer to where that is
instead of just sort of doing all around
the side of your face and the reason why
we use bronzer is just to sort of bring
more definition to the face and also
give a bit of an appearance that you've
been a holiday you've got an amazing
dance and also a great tip is to not
just stop here actually sort of blend it
upwards around your temples and then
onto the top of your forehead this just
makes it look a lot more natural and
just sort of blends together very well
so I dove in to visit that they don't my
ear and I'm repeating this on the other
side
surprises done and now as you probably
guessed blush is next again I'm using an
egg mix product at this is a blush
called foreplay day baked blush which
has an illuminator in it which means
just got a little bit of a sparkly
effect within the lash which gives such
a I can talk which is such a pretty of
back to the chase I think with blush and
smaller brush is better because it is
very hard to clean up brush blush if you
go a little bit too like crazy so when
you smile here you have quite a round
part of your cheek and that's sort of
all we want to focus the blush on cuz
that's the most natural air for the
blush to be in so it's gonna be so hard
to talk and do this
hmm so I'm gonna just smile and put it
on my cheeks
very lightly
and as you saw Ben I just sort of did
little circle motions I don't go too
high up I just sort of stay around this
area here and as you can see it just
ultimately gives you chicks a bit more
of definition and also a bit more color
just makes you look a bit healthier and
glowy and amazing so now it's the last
step of the whole shebang the whole
tutorial we're gonna do lips when it
comes to lips I like to keep it really
natural I've chosen a nude lip liner
this is the chichi stay on lip liner in
the shade centerfolds and the purpose of
lining your lips is just to make them
appear a little bit larger or you can
just use it before applying a lipstick
just to get a perfect even line around
your lips so great tip for doing that
one is if you smile when you do it your
lips actually widen a little bit and you
can see exactly where you are to line of
course start going to remove one billet
mining we've all been there before my
lips are quite small may also run a bit
of a love heart shape I've got a bit of
a dip in the middle of my lips as well
so I like to just fill them in keep the
same shape but just make them look a
little bit larger
my planner is done and I'm a very proud
of guys still sitting here this long
into the video if you are new to my
video you may not know that I like to
keep secret comments within the video
towards the end if you could write in
the comments for me where you are from
like your town your city your a country
anything just really interesting to find
out where you guys are all from because
I love how we could all connect through
YouTube it's just like it's incredible
so that is my super comment of the day
okay
I'm using the NYX soft matte lip cream
and it's in the shade at athens
subscribe to Atlantis weird it just
matches the lipliner that we used and
I'm just gonna pull this over the top
and also if you are wondering why I'm
not at the camera like this that's why
you can't see my face I'm looking at the
camera holding a mirror up and if I look
down and I'm like this so that's why I'm
on the side okay so now we are taking
off this headband so that is my everyday
at a drugstore makeup routine complete I
really hope that I explained it in
enough depth and was very informative to
guys if there's any questions that you'd
like to know such as why certain brush
or what product do you think you need
for certain reason please feel free to
chat to me down there in the comments I
really hope that you enjoyed it and I'll
see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
