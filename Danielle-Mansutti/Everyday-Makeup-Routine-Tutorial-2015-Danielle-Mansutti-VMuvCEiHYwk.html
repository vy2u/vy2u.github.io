today I'm doing my updated everyday at
makeup routine they have done and makeup
routine in the past as you guys know I
don't think I use any of those products
or any of those brushes or anything to
apply that anymore I have a completely
different everyday makeup routine and
you're going to ask to see a new makeup
routine so I thought I would make one
for you and all the products I use today
I'll list below I know I always forget
but I've actually done it this time
so this makeup look is perfect for like
work probably not school depending what
school you go to if you're not allowed
makeup then not school a little bit if
you are loud makeup then it's a great
makeup look for school and it takes me
15 minutes to do all my makeup so it
doesn't take the whole day to get ready
sometimes eyebrows take an hour loads
the eyebrows can take a long time so
just depends what kind of mood I'm in
and seeing how fast I do it if that
makes any sense
so I'm going to be quiet now and show
you guys the tutorial and let's get
straight into it
check out these bad boys eyebrow girls
and I'm using the anastasi public hills
dipbrow pomade in the shade dark brown
and I'm also using a zoeva 3:22 brow
line and brush to apply it today and I'm
really shaky I'm sorry sorry
I don't want so shaky today but it's
going to quickly outline my brows if you
do want to see how I do my brows in more
detail I do have an eyebrow tutorial on
my channel and to clean up the eyebrows
I'm taking the Rimmel wake me up
concealer and I'm going to use a
concealer brush like this one just to
clean up any of the wonky lines that
I've made my eyebrows so I just got a
little bit of concealer like this and
then I'm just going to drag it along my
eyebrow and clean up the mess and I'm
taking a gimme brow by benefit in the
shade medium day to really know why I
use this but I'm
it's something I just find that it just
sort of leaves my brow hairs in place
and also just darkens up any areas which
is still a little bit too much and
moving on to it the face I'm using the
covergirl three why not at last a
feminist foundation in the shade golden
tan I do wear fake tan so this is the
perfect color for me it's so cheap and
affordable I'm in love with its
foundation and it's such a good jute for
stuff like Mac Studio Fix or the Estee
Lauder Double Wear really love this and
really recommend this as well I'm going
to apply this in it little dots around
my face like this I don't like apply
foundation from the back of my hand or
off a surface um because I just don't
know I really just hate doing that so as
you can see the color is slightly
different than my skintone it is a lot
more yellowy than my skintone and
there's a good reason to why I do this
so I'm one of those people
unfortunately I'm born with a red face
with yellow skin because you can see
this is my hand without fake tan on or
anything and it's yellow
compared to my face okay I literally am
like half English and half Italian like
my face is English and then my body is
Italian it's bizarre if you're new to my
channel you might not know that in most
of my videos I like to ask you guys a
question to answer in the comments so
for this video
seeing as I just spoke about
nationalities write in the comments what
your nationality is like your mix or
whatever because that would be so
interesting to find out then just hear
more about you guys because I love
getting stuff you guys so much how many
times can I say you guys in one sentence
so there's a slight difference after I
apply my package yeah so I'll you can
see I love this foundation two bits
I've just been obsessed with it so now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to pop
on that some mascara and today I'm going
to use a mix of the Chi Chi 3d magic
lash mascara as well as the Too Faced
better than sex mascara
and I'm just going to pop on a little
bit of the mascara and this makeup look
seriously it takes me about ten minutes
not even most of the focus on this
makeup look is on the skin so it's all
about making the skin look beautiful if
you guys are put in a position where you
and they have one makeup product for the
rest of your life what would it be
because I would definitely mascara this
is something that I've talked about so
much in videos I just like look at that
difference I just don't I just a quick
little tip if you want to make yourself
appear a little bit more awake and alive
then I was just getting a white eyeliner
I'm just using a cheap one from Gigi
which is the single white female
eyeliner
and just run it in your waterline here I
just find that using a white pencil as
opposed to a black one it just opened
your eyes a lot more um makes them look
bigger and lot rounder and I just find
that with me using a black eyeliner in
my waterline just sort of drags my eyes
down quite a lot so I would definitely
suggest looking into using what I
learned I like this now just going to
contour my nose and I'm using the Too
Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer as well
as a large fluffy brush from Jessup
which is that cheap eBay friend and I'm
just going to Pat it very lightly in my
powder and then I'm just going to sculpt
the line down the news lather it on my
nose but then it's all about as the
blending figure out on the same picture
as before I'm just popping that on my
nose and then i'm using the Real
Techniques essential foundation brush to
draw a line down my nose and this will
just help to straighten up my nose and
make it look perfect I haven't yet
blended out my contouring on the sides
of my nose but I'm
I knew that first I just do concealer
down the sides and also underneath my
eyes like and then I'm just going to
blend that through and then place a
powder on the top and that helps to
blend out these harsh runs the lines
that I have come under my nose which are
extremely sexy by the way and now with
the Australia's AC on tour highlighting
and contouring kit I'm using the banana
shade yellow shade in the palette to set
the concealer from underneath my eyes so
I just find that this brightens up my
under-eye area so so much and I just
don't know I'm obsessed with this powder
a father this helps my concealer from
creasing as well now it's finally time
to give our cheeks home with definition
so using the Too Faced chocolate Soleil
bronzer the same one that I used for
contouring my nose and I'm using a
models prefer contour brush which looks
like this and I'm just going to dip it
in a little bit like that they just feel
where your cheekbone is mine's quite
high it's right here you want to just go
along the hollow of that bone um and
just give it just more as for shadow I
use a bronzer for this however because I
find that it's more like orange shades
work really well for me but if you want
a more like shadowy shape feel free to
invest in a contour kit because they are
incredible but for now I'm just using a
bronzer to contour as it works for me I
don't like to put on like so much
bronzer but I can't blend it out so I'm
just like adding a little bit more as I
go and then I like to blend it upwards
into my temples and then also on my
forehead this just gives your face so
much more definition and makes you look
super sculpted and skinny faced and
amazing now going to pie sum up the lush
and I'm using the NYX baked blush in the
shade for blue I'm going to just pop
this very lightly on the apples
my cheeks and this just brings a little
bit more color to my face it is very
like brown yellow so we're just making a
little bit more gradient with the pink
now it's time to set everything and I'm
using the Rimmel stay matte powder and
I'm going to apply this with a real
techniques multitask brush I believe
it's called it's like scratched off the
brush I'm just going to lightly dust
this all on my face and this just helps
to blend everything together and make it
stay matte like the box adjusts I've
only recently discovered
um highlighting for my face and my
favorite is the Mac soft and gentle
highlighter and I'm just going to put
this very lightly on a duo fiber contour
brush by Real Techniques and just dust
it along the top of my cheekbones I
didn't used to do this but I find that I
do it a lot more now I don't really know
why I do it but I just like looking
sparkly it is that make any sense so
last but certainly not least is a lip
liner this is like I have to do this no
matter what because I just waver for how
my lips look with lip liner then without
yeah it's just like contouring once I
started doing I could not do it any more
I just like the shape my looks a lot
more when I used lip liner so my
favorite natural lip line at the moment
is the colour-pop lippie pencil and it's
in the shade BFF I don't actually use a
lipstick I just use lip liner and this
just helps to make my lips appear a bit
larger and I can't do it and I'm talking
makes my lips appear a bit larger and
also I just like the way it looks so
so I hope you guys enjoyed this everyday
makeup routine please let me know if you
did and leave your feedback in the
comments and I will have a chat to you
