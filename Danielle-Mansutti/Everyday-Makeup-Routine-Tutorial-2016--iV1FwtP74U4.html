today's video I'm doing my updated
everyday makeup routine it is submitted
for more other makeup routines but all
the products that I use in this video I
swear by their my holy holy holy grails
I'm also using a very exciting product
of my own this is the makeup look that I
do on days that I've gone shopping I'm
going up some I want to come like a full
face of makeup normally I just don't
wear makeup everyday I guess if I am
this is my perfect okay point out the
fiber I do it all let's jump into it and
I hope that you guys enjoy the one thing
that I like to use first is always the
two faced hangover primer and then just
rubbing it in so my favorite foundation
of all time as of right this moment many
of you already subscribed to me know
this the NARS sheer glow is absolutely
amazing I love it so much I use the
shade Barcelona this matches my fake tan
perfectly I love it so much what I do I
hope I it is kind of weird actually take
the applicator out of the foundation
bottle and I actually don't it around my
face like this that way I don't get
foundation all over my hands it's just
directly put onto my face so as you can
see this foundation does not match my
face skin color and I'm doing that on
purpose so that it matches my neck my
concealer today I'm using the bare
minerals bare skin concealer and this
one is in the shade fair I normally use
a Beauty Blender or a brush today I'm
using a brush because I just felt like
doing a brush and I was using the Zoe
about 104 buffer brush it's pretty bit
of concealer underneath my eyes like and
this and then we're done and I'm just
going to blend just conceal it out and
this just makes me look awake and ready
for the day alright so now I do not look
like I was up until 1 a.m. last night
watching Netflix so now that I look like
an alien man with toast
foundation concealer on Santa brought
some powder to sort of set everything
together I use the Mac Studio Fix powder
in c3 oh don't anything
is what the product is intended to be
useful I think it's actually a
foundation in itself but um then we'll
coverage the better it is now time to
give myself some eyebrows so I actually
use two different eyebrow products you
do not have to do this my hair is like
50 million different colors so this is
why I do it
basically for the inside of my IRA up
until here at my arch I used the
anastasia beverly hills dipbrow in soft
brown and then for the rest of my
eyebrow i use the mac deep dark brunette
the line Brown gel cream my arch my tail
my favorite blush of all time for
eyebrow application is this makeup geek
jewel and did brow brush honest to god
it's the best i'm just going to start by
using the soft brown on the front part
of my brows so now you can see that the
front part is filled in I'm not going to
go in with the deep dark brunette shade
and fill in the rest of my brow now I
have eyebrows again you know I'm going
to use the Anastasia Beverly Hills clear
brow gel Wow my focus is at one point
today I'm using the brow gel and I'm
just going to apply it to my eyebrow
hairs to make sure that they stay in
place all day and now it is time for
some contour I'm using the Anastasia
Beverly Hills contour kit and I'm going
to be using this brown shade here and
I'm also going to be using this yellow
shade this brown shade we've been using
it for my cheekbone area and the yellow
shade I'm going to go into underneath my
eyes as well you're the problem with
contouring is once you start doing it
you do it every single time for your
makeup so once you start there is
absolutely no going back I'm using a
sigma small contour brush to apply this
date away just in case you're wondering
and my aim is to just follow where my
cheekbone is and then blend all the
harshness upwards toward my temple
now grabbing a mafia m4 22 brush I'm
dipping this in that same contour shade
I'm going to do a straight line down
both sides my nose this makes such a big
difference I feel it makes a big
difference in photos I think my nose
looks really different in photos but in
person it looks okay my goodness letting
to come to my nose was fun because when
I first started doing it I literally had
like two black lines doing my face it
was like what tiny note like it's a
contour guys like have you heard of
blending dirty I'm also going to use any
excess from that on my brush just here
oh wow that was a lot of excess alright
let's blend that out okay oh my goodness
I did not expect it to be that dark well
looks like we've got ourselves a
transition shade oh my god no that's
gone cobble no my iPad oh god I have
enough to face this I'm just going to go
ahead and blend this and then try and
fix it as much as I can so it's not
something I do every day guys but um
oops okay there's more see blend a bit
now I'm going to come this banana shade
from the contour palette with my Real
Techniques contour brush and I'm just
going to place this underneath my eyes
okay let's do something which is going
to change my entire face and that is put
on mascara it always makes me look so
different so I'm going to use the roller
lash by benefit I love this mascara so
much I love it love it love it
I'm just going to pop this on my lashes
and you will see I like a different
person after mascara so we have a slight
difference of the way that I looks right
now so I love you mascara the obviously
the bronze up our faces a little bit
more I'm using vehicle a bronzer by
benefit I love this bronzer so much I'm
Sonia the pan as well as it's like and
I'm taking this Real Techniques brush
and I'm just going to pop it on my
cheeks a little bit more just so that I
look like I feel the holiday 10 but I
mean considering how much I sit in for
as a computer and watch Netflix on my TV
you think I get a suntan from the screen
one minute and also when you do apply
bronzer try and start from where your
eyes sort of level because otherwise it
will look a little bit crazy I'm now
applying this lip liner called spice by
Mac and I do over draw them a little bit
just because I like it to look full so
it's totally up to you you feel
comfortable with following your lip
shape or making it a little bit
overdrawn
and now I'm playing my favorite lipstick
of all time which is called modesty
Womack for my highlight I'm using the
mary lou manizer by the balm this is
just a golden already it's a classic I'm
also using a zoeva luxe fan one to nine
brush how beautiful is this friend I
love it and I was going to pop the
highlight on my cheeks and a little goes
a long way with this highlight so don't
want to put too much on and now for the
super exciting part guys I am using my
eyelashes these are the iSpy lashes in
elegant I love them so much they're so
perfect for just like a natural look and
there is a super close-up for you guys
to see so these are my lashes they are
coming out on the fourth of April this
year I am beyond excited for you guys to
start wearing them trying them I fall in
love with them in so many videos that so
many snapchats I've been wearing white
eyelashes last months but I couldn't
tell you guys I was like oh these are a
set of my natural ones called elegant
and yeah so excited to finally use them
on camera for you guys so excited so
here's the tray and these are what the
lashes look like they're absolutely
perfect like an everyday kind of look
just to emphasize your already beautiful
eyes I'm going to get all close close to
the camera because I need to apply these
like literally with the mirror here
so here you can see the difference that
that is made to my eyes I love this lash
I think it's just so beautiful it will
suit so many people as well these are
elegant just remember that elegant Oh
