welcome back to my channel in today's
fear I felt like we are so overdue so
every tune for an updated everyday
makeup routine basically every single
makeup look I ever make is with this
skin routine so this would be the
easiest way if you understand exactly
what base are use these are my Holy
Grail products but when I say everyday
just hear me out like if I'm gonna run
down the shops to get some chocolate I
ain't wearing no makeup and the only
thing I have left to say is if you're
not already subscribed to my channel
hello I am Dani I would love to have you
on board I have like 20 videos every
single week and I would love for you to
be part of the family all you have to do
is hit that big red subscribe button
below
camera at further ado let's jump into it
and hello I'm focusing the Smashbox
photo finish primer riser I love this
because it is a primer and a moisturizer
in one so it's just perfect anything
that makes me use less products is
always like a win who is texting me I
swear it no one text me at all it's like
alone so if I film more than I feel like
I have more friends my foundation I am
using the Urban Decay all nighter
foundation this one is in the shade 4.5
and this one is just the most amazing
foundation to match to the fact 10 that
I use I use the Rimmel Sun shimmer or
the bondo sands instant black that like
wide bottle I cover what it's gone
so this one for me works the best for
all that kind of stuff I like to just go
for it everyone fits right onto my face
because I'm not wasting any time and I'm
using a Beauty Blender to buff this in
as well because I find that for me it
just gives the most natural finish
compared to a brush and yet to find a
brush which you can compete against my
Beauty Blender but I honestly love this
so much is so good moving on to brows
I'm using the anastasia beverly hills
dipbrow this one is in dark brown
I've usest the site used used used this
for so long can't even speak English
it's just one of my favorite products in
the whole world and if you're interested
in seeing like a full-on like fully
in-depth eyebrow tutorial I'll leave it
in a card right here for you guys I'm
not gonna take the benefit Ready Set
brow gel this product is a must honestly
this is the only eyebrow gel that I've
ever used which actually works my
eyelashes are me eyebrows stay in place
all day like seriously is good and then
I'm gonna use the benefit gimme brow
this one is in five and I'm just going
to use this on the outer part of my
brows just to make sure they are nice
and dark like the rest I just find that
for some reason with my dip brow pomade
it just doesn't go dark enough on the
end so I prefer to use the gimme brow on
my arch and my tail I take it why does
that to me just plays me all the time
I'm like what are you doing this to me
oh my concealer I've been using the
colour-pop and no fill to conceal it now
this looks gross I don't know what has
happened the inside of the packaging is
just gone really strange
probably because it's not empty because
I use this much too much this on this in
the shade light neutral 50 and I'm
pretty sure this is like a real bargain
like it's a really affordable product
and it honestly just works so well for
me I would quite happily compare it to
my Tarte shaped oh it's that good Loki's
how many times my seems so good one
video I swear I'm just using my Beauty
Blender again to blend this into my skin
I find that it is the most effective way
for me to well then this in you just
don't want to see warm product starts
and one product finishes product product
my accent is all over the place cards if
you don't know me and you are new to my
channel first of all hello and welcome
second of all I moved back to England I
was born here until I was 12 and moved
to Australia I moved back to England in
June which is about five months ago and
my accent is just confusing it's like
half English half Australian in half
northern English know what's going on I
don't even know what my words are gonna
sound like before I come out these days
it's just like who are we gonna get
today what accent I'm not gonna have
this is the most amazing product that I
have found recently I've been using this
so much I cannot do my makeup without it
is the Too Faced Born This Way powder
I was so
unsure about how to actually use it in
the first place
but the way that I use it is I just tap
a bit into the lid and I use my beauty
blender underneath my eyes with this
product I put on about that much powder
then I'll dip my wet blend it into it
and then I will just go over the
concealer that we just applied and I
swear to you it is just hope magic it
just blends into your skin so well
leaves your skin looking absolutely
incredible like I just can't even
explain how good it is we are now going
to set our face this is the mecca max
banana baked filter powder I absolutely
love this product it is so good and just
makes my skin feel like flawless I love
the fact that Mehcad Maxima which are an
Australian brand if you weren't aware
about who they are I'm really better
they've got their own products and stuff
now it's now time to bronze ourselves up
and I have been loving the Too Faced
chocolate Soleil bronzer once again
you know how it is when you used to be
really in love with a product and then
you found something else to replace it
but then you go back to that product you
use beforehand and you're like oh my god
I'm a assistant so good that's how I
feel about this bronzer so I like to
start with a morphe full brush this is
more just a kind of contour in a way
like I don't really contour anymore but
I just like to do this first just so
that I have an idea of where to be
placing the bronzer so I'm gonna lift up
my hairline and get right in there the
smell which you never get old it's just
sorry no I wish I could eat this and at
this point something that I've been
doing recently instead of using an
eyeshadow I will just use the bronzer
and I'm just gonna take a little flat
brush and I'm just gonna put a little
bit on my crease of both eyes and then
with any excess I will very lightly line
it on my lower lash line once again just
to add some more depth it's almost like
contour for the eyes which is always
cool and I'm gonna use this on my nose
just to give it a little bit of shape
I'm just gonna go in the smallest amount
like this that actually is not the small
well that was quite a lot that was
really harsh god dammit now that that's
done I will actually grab quite like a
powerful powder powerful powder like you
know what I mean like a powder lots of
coverage powerful well this is the Mac
Studio Fix NC 30 but it's very heavy
coverage which is perfect for under the
eyes so again I'm just going to place it
under here and then I'm also using it to
blend out that nose contour so just from
where I place that bronzer I'm just
gonna blend it outwards just works so
well for burning stuff out like to do
now is grab my Mac gold deposit this is
actually a highlighter but I just love
using it on my cheeks because I don't
play by the rules I'm hit the pan on
that I'm about to get through it so this
is gold deposit I've used this for the
longest time the same product has lasted
me years and I use like every single day
so I'm actually just going to pop it on
this outer part of my face I just really
love the color that it gives them a
little bit finish of the kids it just
gives you really nice bronzy glow now
this product is absolutely stunning it's
a liquid eyeshadow and it is honestly
incredible so this is in the shade rose
gold and it is so pretty so I like to
just add a little bit on my inner corner
tap that in and it just provides like
the most beautiful glow so I just like
to do that for a pop of something
different you know to look glowy I know
that it's like you're going to know but
I just feel like Chloe for me just never
never ends it's always oh it's always
attractive so that's why I do that my
favorite mascara right now is this Marc
Jacobs one unfortunately it doesn't
actually say on the packaging or what
the mascara is called the fine print is
honestly like a size 2 font like is the
smallest size font in the whole world
but with this supervision I will tell
you it is the noir velvet noir major
Volume Mascara I'm gonna go ahead and
pop that on my lashes and I also love
the fact that this mascara is bent
because you can actually get in really
really hard to reach places and it makes
a holding the wand really comfortable as
well you guys know any people in London
or Brighton that can do really good lash
lifts and hit me up because I need to
fly them away my lashes just looks so
these days up a little bit on the outer
corner but I don't want to go to interns
because I don't really want to have
spiders legs I mean how much does anyone
else have a favorite eye for mascara
like this eye the lashes are so much
nicer and more curled and this one I
don't even know what's going on half the
time I'm like eh you okay what was
happening it makes me so annoyed that
like they can't just both be pretty
lashes like I just don't understand why
this has to be so much better why this
is a it's really dirty actually this is
an amazing highlighter which I've
recently discovered which I don't really
think you should be using over powder
but it works anyway okay that's fine so
this is the cover FX custom enhancer
drops they are so good this one it's in
moonlight and I love how it is a little
bit more like a rose gold kind of color
but I'm just going to place the smallest
amount just like that and I'll start
blending it in with my finger and I will
actually use another highlight over the
top of this but I find that this
provides that bare space in the whole
world for my highlight once I have kind
of tapped that into my skin and it is
blended oh it's just so good I really
feel like the whole highlight train is
gonna end soon as well which makes me
sad because it
oh that's but honestly hasn't highlight
being like the biggest makeup trend of
2017 in like the beauty world it really
has and it makes me like really excited
to see what's gonna happen next year
every year it's something different like
you know contour was the big thing then
it was what was the other thing it was
like the glowy contour thing I kind of
strobing that was cool for like six
month wasn't it and I've ever moved on I
think next year will be more like a
natural thing that will be really
popular watch the space we'll find out
soon okay you can see how incredible
that looks but I do like to put a little
bit of Auntie beauty over the top this
if I can open it is this
hustle up everyone is my favorite let's
go ahead and pop the smallest amount on
my face just over that because it kind
of transformed everything into more like
a golden glow which I love and I'll put
a bit under my brows and then lastly in
the corners too and then you are glowing
we have got lips left I have to really
go ahead and wipe be sure that's as
gross I'm gonna go ahead to use the
colour-pop BFF to line up to land my
lips and I can't wait to show you that
like product that I'm using because I
honestly swear by it
holy hell holy grail and it's not the
Tarte lip paint I promise I use it way
too much this lip product has changed my
life this is the yl oh I'm about to
butcher this tattoos tattoos Couture
matte stain I'm so sorry for French and
I just really offended you beautiful
words when it comes to pronouncing names
but this one is in the shade 7 I had a
meeting with myself Beauty they get me
through their goodies to try and then I
went home and I tried this and I cannot
explain to you how much this has changed
my life because I'm so used to liquid
lipsticks which you look incredible for
the first 10 minutes but then dry your
lips and make you feel like the horrible
what I love so much about this is more
of a lip stain but when I say that I
mean like it actually looks like you're
wearing lipstick all day but you don't
feel like you're rang lipstick at all
that is the most incredible thing ever
this is the only liquid lipstick I've
ever tried in my life
which does not feel like I'm wearing
liquid lipstick does not dry out my lips
and lasts all day all day it's lasted
three dinners dates going out it's
lasted everything for me so it is so
good I love how the applicator is like a
real straight applicator it makes it so
much easier for applying it on your lips
as well
and I'm sure you can genuinely say like
how incredible I find this what I would
like I can't even explain happiness and
then last but definitely not least I'm
going to use the Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray this is a must honestly
put any makeup look I swear by this and
so that is my everyday makeup routine
/it tutorial and I hope you guys really
enjoyed it and I can't wait to see all
in my next video so until then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
