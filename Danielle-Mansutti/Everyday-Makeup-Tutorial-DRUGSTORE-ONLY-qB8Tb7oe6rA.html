in today's video I started doing the
everyday natural drugstore only makeup
store and I really hope you guys enjoy
it so this is very fresh clean look here
but just before we jump straight into it
if you want to join our little YouTube
family then all you have to do is click
the subscribe button below
I put two new videos up every single
week and I would love to have you on
board in our little family die remember
you guys enjoy and let's jump into it
and so today we're gonna be starting
with one of our old favorites which is
the covergirl outlast stay fabulous
foundation and this one is in the shade
golden tan this is such a good
foundation it is like one of my favorite
drugstore foundations this foundation is
quite dark which is really good for
thank tanners in the world like me and I
just realized because I think tan this
morning my fingers are looking gorgeous
Oh what is going on and just love the
way this makes my skin look my times can
I say that guys it's so good it's just
so and that would be maybelline instant
age rewind I'm going to put this
underneath my eyes so induce a little
bit of a triangle section here and here
to spoon wake ourselves up a little bit
give us a little bit of life in our face
again I love this concealer a lot more
than what high-end considers as well
this is seriously a double bit suck
double just playing it like this looking
fabulous right now and I don't you blow
this out once again with the Beauty
Blender and as you can see once it's all
blended we look nice and bright
wake ready today with the excess that
still might be Linda I like to run this
underneath my cheekbones or eyebrows
today we're going to be using this a
color pop it is a what is it a brow
color well and this one is called bang
in brunette so we're going to put this
on our eyebrows just nice and gently so
they look
Roland just filled in and full and
pretty this color pop product that I'm
using now is the only thing which is an
online or in the product in this
tutorial I just unfortunately haven't
found a brow product in a drugstore
which did the drill for me I chose Carl
pop because they are extremely
inexpensive and they now ship worldwide
well I figured I would use them and said
everything else that I'm using today I
picked up at Target this is the only
sort of like online e-book store ish
kind of one to set everything in place
we're going to use this Rimmel stay
matte powder this is in 0:04 sandstorm -
something I was actually thinking about
this morning because as of right now the
Olympics is still not as I'm filming
this as watching a mix and stuff I was
really thinking that I so regret as a
child not learning more languages and
that's such like a random thing but it's
the only good speak like a second third
fourth fifth language like you guys are
so talented and I wish I could do that
so actually be really interesting in
this fear in the comments section if you
speak more than one language then write
it in the comments below because I don't
wanna see if you are the most talented
person in the whole world I admire you
so much
so as hope I family art Italian as you
may have gathered from my surname they
like to talk about me in front of me in
Italian so I actually probably I'm
Italian but I would just seriously love
to learn like Italian or French or
something
so I write in the comments below if you
speak more than one language
I'd love to know and now the absolute
star of the show tell us seriously how
insane is this you've got a whole heap
of eyeshadows but some blushes
highlighters bronzers everything it's
incredible story what we're gonna use
today is this brown shake here on our
crease and then I'm going to join that
in with this gold shade here on my lid
2g eyeshadows are so primitive so if
you're in Australia or New Zealand and
you'll sort of like to starting up on
your love of makeup in your makeup
collection and everything starts with
chichi because they are affordable
they're good quality and I actually love
them
always love them if you watch my old
videos at which region use anything with
GG I was like obsessed so now it's all
blended we're gonna go and with the go
change we're just going to pack this on
homage you guys you're gonna try it on
my finger as well see oh oh
the pigmentation Oh what comes up a lot
better my finger I think they're just
dusting through once again to ensure
that it is all blended and I'm taking
this silver shake here and I'm going to
place that on my inner corner and after
my lashes I'm going to use the Chi Chi
3d magic lash mascara keeping in the
whole Chi Chi theme here I'm trying my
best not to do my mascara face I
honestly think if I could only live with
one makeup item I would choose mascara I
don't know why I just feel like so much
more confident and better when I'm
wearing this Cara could just be me but
honestly I could not live without it I
love it so much and I think there is
quite a difference I have this going on
so we are now going to move to bronzing
ourselves up a little bit okay I feel
like this might be a little bit
controversial but I bought the balm and
target in Australia and I was like is
the balm drugstore like what when I did
my drugstore shopping so the bomb
targets I was like it's in a drugstore
so I'm going to classify it as drugstore
I don't know if the bomb has chunks or
not in the US but in Australia it's
drugstore so the good old Bahama Mama
we're just going to use this to bronze
and contra at the same time and I'm
going to share a secret with you guys I
don't do it how to do it like when it
comes to contouring and bronzing I'm
actually the same thing
every time and I act like I know what
I'm doing but in my head I'm like what
about to weigh my hip bet is on
backwards
how long is it be my demo honimaru using
the bar right now we're talking about
this is the is something mary loumanizer
highlighted by the bar I feel like this
is about to break just like flipped and
light weight everything weird noise so I
was going to adjust that on my
cheekbones I'm a Cupid's bow and you
guessed it down the nose so now the face
is pretty much done that we have these
to deal with now and get increasing so
I'm going to use this cheeky lipstick in
the shade which I just wanted to say a
huge thank you for watching today it
means the absolute world to me and I
hope you enjoyed this very simple fresh
natural drugstore makeup tutorial I'll
see you all very soon I love you all so
much bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
