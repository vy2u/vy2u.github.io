today's video and we shown you how I
paint my face on like an everyday makeup
look this is the stuff I'm using for
months really just like these like my
Holly out
holy great a lot of products kept using
all the time have you guys in your
tutorial and let's jump into it okay
let's do this I have got my makeup bag
it does say lips get loot on it because
I think that's hilarious
that's my good you know so I literally
everything that I use it's in here I
don't know how much better my voice will
get progressively further video right
now it is a little bit creepy and a
little bit of skin a bit sexy hopefully
video get bit better let's paint our
faces to make us look more attractive
step 1
I'm going to use a primer this is one
that I always use I just put a tiny
little bit like this once my finger then
you will rub it into dusky and I use the
powder I use a prime huh become it makes
your foundation last longer
apparently it could just be wives tale I
don't know if it actually does but
everyone else does it so I do too the
next item for my baby is a VE Urban
Decay all nighter waterproof long wet
liquid foundation so as you can see I
have the marvelous you know next one
color face is another color so hurry
this foundation will match MONUC a lot
nicer so I like to do a pump directly on
my face like this because I don't like
pumping stuff like on to of try or
something and then on to my face because
I feel like it loot loses I feel like it
wastes so much makeup so I just put it
directly on my face look like war paint
and then I just like blended it to my
skin now that I'm looking kind of
similar to a Simpsons care
tarah banana because I'm very yellow I'm
going to do something with my eyebrows
and I recently got them every feather
brow thing which basically is like a
semi-permanent eyebrow and everything I
just used a little bit of eyeshadow
powder like whatever dark brown I can
fires is what I just picked up it's a
Smashbox one and I just run it through
my brows a little bit so I just like to
keep the shape I'm just filling in any
empty spots but I don't use a whole lot
I just use a teeny tiny a little bit to
ensure the browser's both the same shape
now for concealer I'm using this Tarte
shape tape concealer and I use the super
light one this is in the color fair and
it does look ridiculous when I put it on
my face I just like to do it because it
really brightens my under eye area a lot
it's gonna be super white and super
bright guys I hope you're ready for this
put on your shades get ready it's going
to be quite bad today I just use this in
like a triangle section under my eyes
and like just then I'll blend it out to
ensure that it doesn't look like it does
right now
sometimes my Beauty Blender I'll go in
with a brush and just go over the top of
that to make sure there's no lines or
anything
whew step done we're going to set
everything together
I'm using the NARS powder in beach this
is a pressed powder and I go through
them so fast I already hear the pan on
this one I think this is my 6/6 uh
powder my favorite powder all time
nothing will ever replace it because I'm
in love with it so I'm just going to
press it onto my skin and this like
blends all of that sort of concealer
foundation together flawlessly on this
side and then that site is still very
shiny and stuff like that so it's an
amazing product and after powder I like
to bronze this is the Oprah Americana
bronzer I do have disco covert Oprah it
is Jenny 30 and you get 30% of
their makeup products honestly recommend
this to all of my friends and everyone
that I know I'm like you need more open
products in your life I just love them
and I feel like they're incredibly
underrated so yeah you'll notice I use a
lot of the products in my everyday
tutorial because I'm just like those so
I don't like contour anymore I just
bronze my cheaper it's like I sort of
flatten my brush and then do this motion
and then push upwards
I just don't can't do any more because I
can't be thought that doing that you've
got the time to do that not me I'm just
like I just want to be bronzed and
straight out the door do you want my
nose still a little bit but not too much
she's of Tootsie Tootsie bitch was not
just a little bit my teeny come from
because I just ate a tea that's why I
was going to say is she came out is she
though we are Brahms
now I'm going to do Mia's I just use a
little flat brush like this one like
there's naturally aligned anyway on my
nose and I just like to dark and deepen
it up a little bit and I'm taking this
banana powder by over which you can use
my just comfortable we're gonna place
this under my eyes and also use it to
blend out that nose contour even further
table lip just like stop swimming
annoying I know how you can stop an area
of your face from sweating but right
here for me ah I just realized my fake
tan is looking pretty cool I literally
just go back from like a four day
festival
hence the rundown voice hence the dirty
fake tan
it's all good next I'm using this Oprah
highlighter in Rodeo Drive and I'm going
to play it to face of course you knew I
was going to do that so why should I
tell you I don't know oh my god I'm so
Eggman turn I always forget
and I'm just like shove I am everything
the Ready Set brow for benefit I love
this product I use it to keep my
eyebrows stuck in a certain place all
day and I swear to God they do not move
they do not budge I personally love this
kind of I read product which is sort of
hard in a way like it makes your
eyebrows stick you know what I mean and
when it comes to my eyes I don't use I
shower every single day I will hire use
that bronzer that is before with a
blending brush like this and I will put
that same bronzer shade throughout my
crease just to sort of give my eyes a
little bit more definition but I don't
like to go home with eyeshadow every
single day because you know it's really
hard to like on this side because I'm so
twisted my mirror like has to be a
certain way for my camera to be a
certain way so I'm always like oh trying
to get this side done it's really odd
actually I'm going to show you this
mascara I do use it like some days it's
really cool I got it in LA I don't know
this brand at all it just says flower
love is the name and it is a zoom in
ultimate mascara come on camera show
them what's really cool about this is
that it has three different mascara ones
in the one thing it's really weird if I
see you do - you lengthen your lashes
with your wand like this and you twist
it once and then it becomes more of like
a you know twisted thing you do it a
third time and it becomes really really
really tight how cool is that it's
really cool so I'm going to put back on
the first setting to lengthen my lashes
really unfamiliar with the brand I got
it as part of a PR thing I'm just like
this is really fun
anything which is like fun or exciting
when it comes to makeup is just awesome
because I find putting on makeup so
yes you know like coming from someone
with a beauty channel who hasn't been
posting many makeup videos I know I know
I just so know like I do my makeup the
way that I'm showing you today with
these products I don't really do
anything else I don't know I just sort
of feel like once you find what you're
comfortable with it's very easy
especially as a woman to stick to that
and then I get super lazy super
comfortable and then just pretty much
only do that ever someone else do the
same thing like I literally just use
these products these days I like to try
everything that I get sent you will go
but I'm very loyal in doing makeup
products I'm like I love you and I'm not
gonna cheat on you I promise I feel
guilty about cheating my makeup products
having a little bit of a hate
relationship with my eyelashes lately
and just not what they used to be and I
don't know if I'm ever a bit inspired or
at the moment so I do tend to wear false
lashes a bit more than they used to like
in everyday use
so I'm going to use these natural
everyday ones from ISO eyelashes these
are the lashes in sweet so as you can
see there's a super super super super
super super natural which is perfect for
every because I don't be like shebar oh
I'm wearing eyelashes wanted to be like
there's your real eyelashes no mo hmm
you can see they're super gorgeous
natural eyelashes and I'm going to be
popping mom you can get these from Danny
be calm they are my own eyelash brand
these are the sweet style they have like
no black big vent at all so they should
look super duper typically we do a
little of good natural
now the lashes are is time to do our
lips and I get asked how many times what
lipstick I'm using lately is the
tightest a lip paint by taut this is in
the shade bestie and they revealed this
back when I did that Bora Bora trip it's
hard and I honest-to-god have not used
other lipsticks since then that was in
October last year so I pretty much
obsessed with this stuff it's amazing
I'm firstly just gonna align my lips
how many good with the lip paint it
dries so fast it's like the most amazing
thing ever you guys are gonna love it so
good then last definitely not least is
applying some makeup setting spray this
is one way over to Kay I'm just going to
do a few little pumps just to o make
sure that all lasts all day and then we
are pretty much done underneath some
little model poses for you now obviously
the makeup up close but this is pretty
much it
and that is the tutorial complete I hope
you guys enjoyed it it was informative
to find out my Holy Grail items and this
is like the stuff please every single
day I hope you guys enjoy this I love
