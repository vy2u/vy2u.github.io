life today I launched my Danny beading
store products the first products we are
watching are the I spy eyelashes and
they're going to be live from today if
you are super smart and followed the
Instagram page for Danny beady store
then you will know the secret code to
get to the website today in today's
video I will be going in depth about
each eyelash and also showing you how
they all look on my eyes so you know
which one would suit you best and just
giving you a lot more if you're
answering FAQ and stuff like that that
I've received recently so let's talk
about the lashes and a little bit more
detail because I was very vague on the
announcement I wanted to design an
eyelash which was affordable don't mind
this some eyelashes which are like forty
fifty dollars I'm like what on earth so
it was my absolute number one aim was to
design these and make sure they could
still be super affordable for you guys
at the same time I know that a lot of my
audience are teenagers as well so I
wanted to make sure that it would be
able to be pocket money prices too
when I was in the design process for the
eyelashes the most important thing to me
was a clear Bend the majority the lashes
do have a clear bed or they have a very
very very thin black band anyone who's
what my makeup tutorials before you know
how much I hate these black bands on
eyelashes I always complain about it I
think it's so ugly and it just makes it
look so obviously ranked falsies so I'm
giving it super affordable the eyelashes
are six dollars 95 Australia which means
it'll be even less than that in the u.s.
we offer a currency converter on the
websites that you know up to date what
you will be paying for the lashes in
your country we don't want to set a
fixed price for every country because we
thought it might be quite unfair if it
turns out one country is paying more or
paying less than other country
personally I think that's a pretty damn
good deal 695 these lashes that is not
including the shipping but every single
one of my lashes are handmade therefore
they may be slightly different might
have a little bit of variance in each
lash as compared to the photograph on
the website because as they are all
handmade obviously no two eyelashes are
going to be exactly the same we use the
top quality synthetic hair for the
eyelashes because you want to ensure
that it's vegan and cruelty free so we
don't worry about any nasties in this
product at all it's all very very very
very happy product I designed all of
this completely myself I designed the
packaging by myself and I send the logos
I'm looking at stuff completely on my
irons and I just psyched thrilled and so
excited these are finally released and
you guys can finally get your hands on
them as well so let's just go ahead and
jump straight into it this is the first
flash that we will be talking about
today this lash is called flirt it's
like it's quite a natural lash but still
adds a bit of drama to your lashes as
well I decided to call these elections
float because I just feel that they are
very very sexy they are very flirty and
they are very girly and cute they can be
used for a day they can be spent
everyday they're so versatile so I love
the flirt lash the next classroom I'm
talking about today is elegant elegant
isn't it absolutely beautiful soft lash
it is so good for an everyday use I did
use it in my everyday makeup
recently this for me is a perfect
everyday lash because it adds a lot of
length to your lashes but doesn't add
that sort of fake big intense look to
your life what so ever and it's very
natural and very easy to wear the lashes
that I'm wearing right now today on the
admire lash one of my all-time favorites
I love this lash because it really
really really gives you that amazing cat
eye look with it and you can see all my
eyes today they're just amazing they're
stunning and they stand out so much and
I love how it gradually gets thicker
threaten the lash the next lectures are
a little bit more dramatic these lashes
are called midnight and my friend is
midnight more for at the party girl
that's why I called it midnight all
makes sense now doesn't it
so I decided to create these morph like
a clubbing party sort of blush we all
need one of these in a lot of certainly
let's be honest they / absolutely
gorgeous for just bringing something
extra to your eyes this is the enchanter
lash and what I love about the enchanted
lash is that it looks so natural people
will ask you are you wearing false
lashes are those real lashes these
actions are proving my smallest lash
that I have but they still add so much
to your appearance like they just add a
little something extra to it so the
enchantment is great for the girls I
don't want to go too dramatic I
personally think that these are so cute
these are the smitten lashes and I love
these because I currently smoke like a
cute everyday girly kind of lash I
really like these kind of style lashes
with a clear band and just very natural
very easy to wear because they are my
favorite lashes to wear and I feel like
these would suit so many different eye
shapes and just remember if the lash is
a little bit too long for your eyes all
you have to do is snip off a bit from
the end not the front so if you just
snip off a little bit from the end it so
much as your eye shape that it will
perfect all these lashes last weekend
you will see me wearing them on
Instagram
these are amazing these lashes are
called glam
of my definite favorites Glamis so
gorgeous and it just sort of starts
thing again and works way thicker I love
this because it does create a cat eye
look and that is the look that I love so
that's why so many my lashes are thin
going into thick I feel like it provides
such a cool look for your eyes and it's
something which you should definitely
try it if you haven't already this kind
of style it looks amazing on everyone
that's ever tries it now these are very
similar to glam however I feel like glam
it's a little bit more dramatic than
this is like a step down from the drama
and these are probably my favorite
lashes personally out of the whole range
and that is the Ilona lash I reckon the
Luna lash is just the most stunning lash
I can wear on my eyes these are a
personal favorite of mine because they
just look amazing on they look amazing
with so many different eye makeup looks
as well for a little bit of drama we
have got the famous lash I definitely
wanted to include a second very dramatic
lash into the range just so that we have
enough choice for everyone again when
designing these I did want a thin band
on these because these are quite a thick
eyelash but then had to be just a teeny
bit thicker otherwise it just wouldn't
hold its shape and it would just be too
heavy for the lash and everything next
we have got fancy now fancy are
absolutely amazing for an everyday look
face it comes out a little bit thicker
on the end so you do get that cut eye
effect once again very perfect for it
everyday use because it isn't too long
it isn't too heavy or anything like that
so yeah the biggest thing is that I want
them to be affordable I wanted them to
be fun I wanted them to look nice and I
want you guys to love them too I really
heard that you do love them because it's
gonna make me beyond happy to see my
little babies being used by you guys and
