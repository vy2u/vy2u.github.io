today's video I have my eyebrow routine
and I'm going to be explained today
step-by-step Huggett my eyebrows from
this to this it's actually crazy because
I was looking at my old about routine
the other day I which you don't use any
of those products anymore so I was like
I think it's time for an update of every
day so I'm gonna make sure this video is
typically as if you're beginner if you
need to follow along but if you do have
any questions but anything that I do or
my techniques and please write it in the
comments and I will try and get back to
you so before we get into video I'd like
to explain that I do have set the brows
meaning I have a semi permanent tattoo
on my eyebrow it's like little brush
strokes a little hairs might have stayed
it a little bit so make semi-permanent
brows are great when I'm not wearing any
makeup whatsoever but you'll see that
when I do put on my foundation and my
skin makeup they can't disappear so I
need to fill in my brows afterwards ooh
I'm going to show you all the products I
use the technique so you tips and tricks
everything in between so I hope you guys
enjoy this tutorial and let's get into
it and here are both my brows completely
naked against being completely filled in
firstly I'm going to do a little bit of
grooming and maintenance so I'm just
going to pluck out any stray hairs that
are sitting underneath my brow and I
don't personally plug above my brow I
just go by underneath and then I'm going
to start with the benefit cabral to fill
in my brows today I used a brow in shade
4 and it does come with this cute little
brush as well
but I will be using my own brush today
and this is the color of the corral that
I'm using when it comes to filling in
your brows honestly the most important
thing is the pressure that you're
applying on the brush as you can see I
am using quite light strokes at the
start and I'm just mapping out the shape
of my eyebrow and you'll see as I go I
actually change the direction I'm
holding the brushes so I can get in
there to benighted minute I can go to
get in there a little bit better on the
tail
I find the tail so hard to do with the
brush flat but I like to direct it above
my head and work downwards and then I go
to the top of my brow and I try and keep
my eyebrow like parallel lines so keep
them as symmetrical as possible on the
top and the bottom but when I get to my
arch I do tend to have it a little bit
narrower than the bottom line it's very
easy to see you then explain I've no
idea how to reply it basically and then
I'm going it in the middle and I'm
filling in all the empty gaps with my
brow and a sneaky little tip from me if
you grab a spoolie brush and you brush
your hairs downwards it makes it so much
easier to find all the hidden patches
that you still need to fill in
I'm someone who loves a bit of a fade in
the browser a nice gradient going on
there so in order to get that I'm
changing the way I'm holding my brush
and I do little strokes like this to
imitate little hairs at the front and
just keeps it nice and light and natural
then I'm going in with a concealer brush
with little bit of concealer and I'm
using this to clean up my eyebrows and
now honestly this makes such a huge
difference makes your eyebrows look so
sharp and so clean and I can't recommend
it enough
to ensure my brows stay in place all day
I'm going to use the Ready Set brow brow
gel life benefit this is my Holy Grail
brow gel I am obsessed with it so I use
this to make sure that my hairs stay in
place all day and don't sort of like
hang below my brow which is always like
oh and it's quite a common with filled
in brows to have your brows looking a
bit blonde and stuff so I use the
benefit gimme brow to get my brows a bit
of a tint and make them nice and dark on
the ends as well and now you can see the
huge difference to my filled in and non
filled in brow these products give you
life they're so good I swear and here
are my brows both filled in so this is
how they look at the very end
and that is my eyebrow routine I do that
like every single day it doesn't go too
long takes about five minutes so it's
super easy perfectly it helps and also
you learn a few tips and tricks and
stuff like that I'd like to thank
Benefit Cosmetics response to mr. J
which is amazing because I only departs
anyway from eyebrows like win-win and
thank you so much for watching my video
so until next time guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
