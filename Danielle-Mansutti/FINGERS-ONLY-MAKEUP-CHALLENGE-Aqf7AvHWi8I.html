let's just start right into it guys
so the no brushes challenge is pretty
much self-explanatory I have not
actually watched any of the know brush
challenge videos I just know it's
trending because my internet is down
right now thanks T PG I can't watch any
of the videos I'm going to go off what I
assume the no brushes challenge is which
I do you don't use brushes so let's
start we wash let's just start straight
with foundation I'm going to use the Too
Faced Born This Way Foundation
personally I am dreading my eyebrows and
my eyeshadow it's gonna be my Solaris
thing about this feels like I'm putting
sunscreen on my face this is so weird I
have like so many makeup wipes in front
of me cause um that I'm actually putting
moisturizer or something it's probably
good thing that I haven't seen anyone
elses for you're doing this yet because
it saves me from like knowing tips that
they did to do their makeup or something
like special chips are used to do that
eyeshadow okay let's go up to the
forehead and hairline to make it look
like worksheet and and on hairline not
why did I ever to people put concealer
on my finger and then on their face or
do they put it straight on their face
and blend out with it finger it is a no
brush challenge guys so you know what
I'm gonna do I'm just going to go like
super hardcore here and actually like
put the concealer on my finger this is
the bare minerals spare skin fair
concealer so I'm gonna put this straight
onto my finger and then on my face oh
gosh if I just left like this damn now
we blend this bad boy in my forehead is
stuck it is definitely looking cakey AF
right now after face comes eyebrows I'm
not going to use dip brow my finger
because that is just a disaster waiting
to happen
Ami's and eyeshadow
cosmetics modern neutral palette so I'm
not yet to use this I just received it
it looks very pretty
so my eyebrows what color my IRA is kind
of a she I'll use this color here oh do
me very sad okay uh-uh girl those
eyebrows are fine
all right now this is a mess mess I'll
try to clean this up with the concealer
look I can see like in a nail and try
and use this as a brush I was shooting
the challenge with this is to actually
try and make it look somewhat good I'll
try this but this is really hard
I'm going to use this as a transition
shade which is gonna be so hard okay
oh that is very very pigmented okay I'm
thinking very like I'm sure that is
mascara when we get to it because I
can't for them with my finger so hotties
the one for that surely how much do that
and then that's what my thing is often
the leaf color it's just as orange looks
like fun something different yeah we
have got orange everywhere I'll grab
that crease color once again and run
that under my lash line hmm
so with the scar I'm just assuming that
I just do it as normal just going to it
very lightly as I just got in tinted so
I don't need too much I'm using the Too
Faced better than sex mascara yeah yeah
we have the really fun task of as a
simple base having to do the bronzing
and be highlighting in the contouring
I'm not looking forward to this I'm
going to grab the Too Faced cocoa
contour palette
I'm grabbing medium maca making up and
trying to put this in my tree the knots
my temples as well alright now it's time
to wipe my hands I'm gonna grab the
cocoa butter shade now I tell my nose
and then underneath my eyes true good
one right so I now have highlighter all
over my table and all of my pants so
good one
I'm just picking it up table right now
just couldn't straighten my legs and
down no oh my god my nose is like Dean
so like I said before about oneis
applicator ones this is a Smashbox a
liquid always on liquid lipstick
stepping out I'm ready sure think it's
applied so the applicator
this feels really weird your gosh pileup
stick really what we're doing this cuz
you can feel so much better and are the
wand the more you know guys make it was
all oh my forehead my eyebrows is like
girl you okay so that is why a no
brushes challenge complete I feel
extremely cakey and extremely fatty
right now so I'm just like I cannot wait
to run to the bathroom and take this
home so I can guys enjoyed that I mean
I'll give you massive room and then
you'll be like whoa like check out that
brow risky makeups okay it's just kind
of like hi far away and so that is the
