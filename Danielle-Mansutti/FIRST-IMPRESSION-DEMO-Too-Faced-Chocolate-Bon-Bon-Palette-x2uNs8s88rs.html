today we are doing a first impression at
a review on the Too Faced chocolate
bonbon palette this is the 3rd edition
to the chocolate bar palette by Too
Faced I was so lucky to see a sneak peek
of this back in October when I visited
the Too Faced headquarters and as soon
as I saw that this is released I was
like I have to get my hands on it so I
only have and I decided to do a first
impression and a review today I have
done with this eye look with the palette
you will see me creating this look later
on in the video if you like to stick
around to the end to watch but first
we're going to talk about the palette
itself so let's just talk about the most
obvious thing which is the packaging
does anyone polly pocket because it all
things that you supplier than you a
little girl I don't like that much so
much polly pocket this is just such a
girly gorgeous thing to have and it will
look amazing on anyone's dressing table
it's so so so cute so inside the palette
we have got a selection of pinks we have
some Browns a lot of shimmers and a lot
of cool tones as well I really like how
two-faced have been she got two of the
more Pink's for us for this palette and
of course not to mention the love
heart-shaped eyeshadow pairs in the
palette are just the sweetest touch the
develop is so so cute on the back of the
palette that is a little description and
it says discover a candy coated
confection of heart-shaped shadows and
fuse with antioxidant rich cocoa powder
include 16 matte and shimmer shades and
delicious pops of color
sugary bright and beautiful go to
neutrals and the best element one swipe
formula you know I love the way that you
unboxed the palette you do get a little
powerful that comes out with a sort of
help guy to give you just sort of like a
push in advice for what I looked you can
make the palette I definitely felt like
this eyeshadow palette is serve its
whole full length video on my channel
because
I love Too Faced so much and I was so
excited to try this out I really wanted
to do it on camera and know it is it
sponsored I just genuinely love them so
without further ado let's jump into my
first impressions so just from what
taking a look at the palette now
honestly I'm like what should I do
really like their pink and purple shake
it might lead towards something like
that everything here is quite sheer
the only two problem mats my crease
color before dough or maca and they're
both the longer I debate what to use a
more stressed we both loved ones so I
think that I'm going to use a mock up on
my criticals this is a nice color this
actually looks a lot nicer on my eye
than I thought it would from the palette
the palette it looks very sort of like a
grayish Brown but it's actually not
great or thick the Lord I'm just going
to continue to blend this in I'm using a
multi m4 and for three is very brush I
recently got some Mac brushes and these
are just like identical and so much more
affordable so I definitely love morphe
brushes so officially I could say I am
in love with that crease color I really
really really love it I'm just going to
continue it on the other side but I just
don't know like what I shall look to
make bad notes from a weekday I'm just
like but this one is very no motivation
Sundays but you know it once I start
going and stuff and it all sort of comes
together
down how to chat with you guys so long
like when I'm doing my makeup because
I've been doing with voiceovers recently
because right literally right behind
that window they are building a house
currently it's their lunch break which
is why I'm doing this right now during
our lunch break so if there's no noises
but it's very annoying now I'm going to
be super brave and use cotton candy see
how this works on my lip so I need to
get a flat brush and because it's quite
a sheer shadow just so that I get a good
color payoff I'm just going to quickly
write to the voiceprint my brush with um
Mac prep and prime which is fix+
and then I'm going to dip it in to
cotton candy and let's go for it it is
really light so depending what kind of
look you're after it's great for a
natural of this color but I want to sort
of open it up a little bit because why
not looks so like strange to me right
now because I never used never here's a
color like this actually what to look at
purple my island to nothing should I use
this crazy big one yeah let's do it
that's good I'm going to put this on the
outer part of my lid then I'm just going
to take my brush from before and blend
the two colors together what should I do
now I think I'm going to go in with this
shade called Bordeaux sort of got
halfway about my lid and I'm just going
to see how this goes so I thought
they've been over
it's cold it looks so right on camera
though it's so weird it's like
Granderson I'm asking me show you called
molasses chip and I'm going to use my
finger to apply this to the inner corner
of my eye see how that works I'm also
going to put it on my tear duct area I'm
not going too much pigment from the
shade I'm going to try using sprinkles
instead lighten it up a little bit I
think I'm just grabbing curly fetch once
again that super pink color and I'm just
going to blend this over my crease just
a little bit of color back in there now
this is super white shade called
divinity I'm just going to pack this
underneath my brows as a highlight my
lower lash line I'm going to do look I'm
going to take it totally fresh once
again and run it along the waterline now
I'm going to apply lash domination by
bare minerals on my lashes Oh looks like
I will have to wait to try and then get
it off Wow
so I just applied the eyeshadow I have
to say I'm actually really happy with
how it turned out as you saw as always
liked her I think that the pigmentation
of the pink tones was sobered totally
fetch and cotton candy are absolutely
stunning they absolutely incredible I
did find that this molasses chip because
I said the last two was a little bit
disappointing a big divinity I used for
my under eye highlight was actually
really pretty as well and I absolutely
swear by this maka shade down for a
crease color that work absolute wonders
I would definitely recommend this for
something like proms I think this is the
perfect prom palette and it is so pretty
and gorgeous and girl
that I mean come on who wouldn't want it
in terms of how it waves up to the other
chocolate lab pallets I have only done
this one look I can't really compare
them lately because I swear by the
toothpaste original chocolate bar
palette really really really really
really really like this though I really
like honey I look turned out so I would
probably say I compare this over the
semi-sweet palette but the chocolate bar
palette as we all know is like Lewis
palette of all times this sorry
semi-sweet that you're not as good as
the one one palette oh this looks like a
massive thank you to everyone who's
watched this review today and first
pressure or anything on this style with
foundations but is really fun doing it
with an eyeshadow palette as well so
please let me know if you enjoyed and
I'll be singing really soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
