have spoken to you this fresh face I am
doing a first impression today I have
known in a long time it's for the Urban
Decay all nighter liquid foundation so
it is a full-coverage long way matte
finish waterproof oil-free I am going to
apply this onto my face and we're going
to do a bit of a chat about the
foundation I'll do a photo test for you
to see like how it looks with flash
there's a flashback and all that stuff
and then I'll come back in a few hours
throughout the days let you know how
it's been wearing and how it isn't
everything I think we may as well just
jump into it and stop rambling so I'm
going to put on the event as always
headband is on I don't know whether on
to apply primer hmmm okay we're not
going to apply primer so that we can see
how long the foundation actually lasts
by itself sounds good
I have not obviously used this yet it is
still in its packaging so this is the
packaging that it comes in this very
like reflective as you can see that it
keeps catching the light I have the
shade 5.0 think it could be a little bit
dark for me but my neck is pretty dark
today fake tan recently and I thought
that this color and this color look
similar
so male like I end up with mustard on my
face let's hope that I don't let's hope
this actually matches it is telling me
it's shake before yeast because I did
like an urban decay first impressions
a few months ago and I didn't shake it
first and everyone was saying Group me
in the comments because it was like
literally water it was so liquidy so it
has a pump that it's a great start that
is a very great start so I'm just going
to be playing this with the brush to do
this is a brush by Tarte cosmetics come
on you can do it I believe in you oh
that is a little bit dark
alright let's just do this what colors
actually quantumwise this looks like
very similar to the Barcelona NARS sheer
glow Shay to me that is a lot better
than I was expecting I thought it'd be
like yellow I'm liking this coverage so
fast they're good you can see that I
don't actually look cakey are we always
there but like a white forehead oh I
look gay in that sense but it looks very
like airbrush and smooth which is really
nice so because of my new camera it
makes everything look so high definition
you know like wearing makeup a part of
those cameras a bit like but yeah I mean
I don't have like any kind of softening
filter or anything on this camera and
from what I'm seeing on the display my
back it looks very not oh yeah when I
went to Bora Bora this is like my little
potty trick a girl found it so weird
okay
and this is gonna look even one way now
sports my eyelids but apparently it's
really weird that I can do this after
makeup I just love that I can do that so
much okay a little normal so as you can
see the foundation is now on my face I
use two pumps for my thai face which is
pretty crazy I'm just wiping my
foundation things right now I'm gonna do
a photo test I'm gonna show you how it
looks with such aa graffiti and
everything but my first impression
before it's like oxidizing anything onto
my skin and it's very fresh is am I'm
liking it a lot it looks really really
really good I'm very impressed with it a
lot more than I thought it would be the
color match I think is flawless
it's amazing and I really hope that
don't get disappointed with it
throughout the day of just having
foundational I feel
I look like a moon so I'm just gonna do
another makeup tutorial and I'll jump
back in about two hours when I finish
doing that and I'll let you know how
it's going but for now I'm going to show
you the photo test and then we're going
to talk about what's the foundation and
look at stuff hey guys so I just filmed
a tutorial and now we are going to talk
about the foundation how it's wearing
everything so I put on four hours ago my
girl it took a long time deformers
talketh I've been at sweating of buckets
of my top lip so I've had to
continuously keep applying it to my top
lip because it's just an issue that I
have and it's so annoyed like ignore my
mouth area and look at everything else
the foundation itself let's talk about
what it says on the box
so the ultimate foundation for a
flawless looking complexion this
waterproof formula provides complete
coverage at lasts all day or all night
with that modern matte finish that never
looks overdone we loaded this full
coverage foundation with such an insane
amount of pigment that little goes a
long way there's no need to build your
coverage or apply multiple layers so
personally I was incredibly impressed
her and they needed one pump per side of
my face because that never happens like
ever it's crazy because normally I would
put like so many pumps on my finger and
then onto my face but this coverage is
amazing it's very very very buildable
and to be honest like I know this is the
beginning of my review and everything
but judging by how it's lasted even
though you know I'm switching to the
lights I'm definitely going to wear this
like every single day because I really
like it I want to see how it goes just
for more natural makeup and everyday
makeup and everything like that but for
four hours I'm incredibly impressed it
looks exactly the same as when I applied
it which is great I do actually have an
issue with the packaging I found it very
very very difficult to judge the color
of the foundation from the packaging
because it is such a small amount of
space where you get to see the color of
the foundation
personally prefer when I can actually
judge from the outside of the foundation
like what color it will be because I
choose between like four foundations it
was just a bit of a nightmare I was like
squinting at it like what is that color
I'd be like for example what a
foundation is like a full color like
that because to try and see the color
this one I found very difficult however
I understand in order to have this
beautiful design they had to compromise
from seeing the color
I just wish maybe this was a bit more
open so I could have been able to see
because that was my only issue my first
impression issue when I did open it up
and it's always like impossible to see
from you know a 2d image of a color to
judge that to see the color of the
foundations as you can see what it says
on the box here actually looks very
different to my skin like the box looks
way more like kind of ivory and yellow
my skin definitely more neutral I'm
actually very glad that I did just trust
my gut and take this one because it
matched flawlessly it's the 10 that I'm
wearing today which is so nice for once
to actually a foundation which matches
you 10 yeah so the foundation dude
oxidized when I applied it it does end
up being a little bit darker than when I
first applied on to my skin because it's
something like a smidge darker but
luckily that kind of worked in my favor
because I needed it to be a little bit
darker to sort of suit my neck so I was
like yeah I'm happy with that you guys
saw had a big pimple here like you can
hardly see it at all right now I had a
really big fat red pimple right here and
it's like it's gone it's gone it's peps
bags and it's gone until i take off my
makeup later but i'm very happy with
that like that's awesome normal you can
see like a bit of a bump in a bit of
dryness whatever but no dryness which is
amazing no dryness for my nose I do
however have dryness here in my smile
lines but that's because I'm talking and
when I talk as this foundation sets it
will set into my smile lines and
everything like that so that happens
with most foundations anyway it's
definitely not as bad as some other
foundations that I've tried even some
other urban decay foundations that I've
tried they know
do sink into here a lot more so that's
really really really good that it
doesn't do that because it's such an
annoying thing that I have to deal with
because I smell too much oh just kidding
out how they I'm small I think I was
smiling in my head my face is like this
resting bitchface moment I'm like
seriously hard being with this
foundation stays like this the rest of
the day because if it does I'm using
this foundation every single day because
I really fall in love with it I really
really really like it I don't really
have that much bad to say about it
except like the bottle think of the
design of the bottle best decisive point
was the actual product on my face looks
great and the color is great and I'm
really happy with it I'm really loving
this really excited to see how it lasts
for a day I'll check in with you guys in
about another three or four hours and
we'll have an update when it's reached
around about the eight hour mark okay
well hello guys it has been three hours
since I last checked in with you I am so
happy like this is eight hours I just
like I don't get it I'm like I can't
believe this looks what it does and no
this is not a sponsored video I'm not
being paid or anything like that I
genuinely and like shocked by this
foundation it is really really good if
you need to know I do have normal to dry
skin so I can't speak for those with
oily skin because my skin is nor too dry
it has worked fantastically for me I did
a little bit of research well I was off
a few hours and I have seen it amazing
for oily skin as well
so since I'm a very versatile amazing
foundation and I'm just like blown away
by it I'm going to start using this
every single day because I'm obsessed
I'm in love and I don't know what else
to say I love it guys I really love it
and I'm so impressed so I'm just like
can we get married now I would give this
a nine point five out of ten the only at
point five mark is because there's a
packaging like I said before I couldn't
tell color so it's that incredible so
hope you guys enjoyed this little review
of this foundation today
I hope that the like flash test helped
you out it did have a slight flashback
that's because the phone was like here
when I was taking it babe it's a normal
photo and same for far away you be sweet
so hope you guys enjoy this I'll say
till very soon and have a great day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
