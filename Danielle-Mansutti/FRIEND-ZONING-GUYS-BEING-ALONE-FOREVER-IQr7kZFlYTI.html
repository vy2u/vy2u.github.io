today's video I asked you to send me a
some questions on Twitter's and the
hashtag ask Danny so doesn't really do
much of an intro let's just get straight
into the questions first question is do
you think staying friends or best
friends with your ex is a good idea in
my personal opinion I wouldn't want to
be friends with an ex unless it all
depends on the circumstances I guess my
ex I would want to be friends with
because it'd be too difficult because if
you've been with someone for a long time
to be their friend and to see them with
other people and other relationships um
unless you haven't been with them very
long and you get over that very fast I
couldn't I couldn't bear to see anything
but I feel as well like to move on to
the next chapter of your life you need
to like close all the other chapters
from your past if you meet someone you
tell them hey I'm really good friends
with my ex um kind of like else to my
opinion so Harambee it's a stupid
question how did you get motivated to
start exercising and eating healthy more
I basically got motivated by seing
really really really awful photos of
myself for really awful angles and I
just kind of liked it somewhat I really
look like okay then there's also some
documentaries that I've watched like the
amount of sugar we consume it's crazy
and it is very scary to think that we
are all likely to have diabetes with my
order because we consume so much sugar
and sure isn't so much stuff that you
would never think like a can of baked
beans has like what is it like a quarter
of your day's worth of sugar in it it's
like why why are you putting sugar in
baked beans but that's the size point I
also got motivated to start this whole
healthy thing because I'm going to Bora
Bora so this may be uploaded one in Bora
Bora tart but I didn't want to feel
self-conscious or the other influences
who have like the most amazing body job
even though I'm we will still be quite
covered up because you guys may see that
I don't really wear many outfits that
sort of show my shoulders or my stomach
and I may occasionally but I'm saying I
don't often I feel more comfortable
covering my shoulders and covering my
belly so we'll see how I go in Bora Bora
but I don't know I was a little I felt
load
pressure a little bit scared that end
day it's all what's in here which makes
you confident not here so many keep
telling us how but it's a good one which
youtuber would you love to mate pretty
much just within his last year I've met
so who they love
I met Casey nice day I met desi I met
Katie I met Lauren I've met so many you
choose this year at events and stuff
like that that I've met like pretty much
everyone I want to meet there's two each
was like absolutely love I don't know
Matt investor from the UK I would love
to meet zoella and I would love to meet
Luiz okay sprinkleofglitter I love
watching her videos because it makes me
feel really homely because it reminds me
so much of England and I just love to
meet them I think they're really really
really gorgeous women and I reckon we'd
get on pretty well and I have a good
fangirl moment what's going on I don't
know I think they would be really
awesome to me so yeah any lustige maybe
it's just a lot let's play on the life
do you have any brothers or sisters
every single time I mentioned my brother
some of us you have a brother yes I have
a brother my brother is two and half
years older than I am so he's 24 I hope
so I don't actually know if I've really
told you guys about my brother before my
brother is really into games
he studied games graphic design at uni
and he completed that and then he went
on to do another degree and now he works
in like programming and games and stuff
like that so growing up he always passed
down things to me like all I Nintendo
games so I grew up playing a Pokemon and
Zelda and stuff like that because my
brother passed down to me I was such a
tomboy growing up because I pretty much
had all of Lawrence's secondhand things
so I loved playing like with trains and
cars and stuff with him and reenacting
like Pokemon battles and stuff still
growing up we loved we loved at the
Nintendo 64 like it was the best thing
ever
here and I even though we have our
similarities our values are similar to
be like that we are so different in
terms of like our hobbies and I
interests and when we moved here I was
12 and he was 14 or 15 and
I instantly lost my accent I wanted to
just mesh in with the crowd and do want
to be a set of attention or anything
like that my brother kept his accent he
was like that in that screw you I'm
keeping my English accent I want to be
different so that's the biggest
difference right there my brother wanted
to stand up being different and I wanted
to like close myself in a little shell
and sort of transform into everyone else
around me I don't really talk much about
my family online to sort of respect
their privacy as foes and also because
it would break my heart if people said
nasty things about my family like you
can say nice things about me but you say
nose and things about my family and I'm
like no I got even me threatening I'm
just like like scratching my neck yeah
seriously I would love to do a video my
mom though it loves to a Q&amp;amp;A video with
my mom but I just don't want to put her
under this spotlight of scrutiny because
it would kill me how do you tell your
guy best friend you don't feel the same
way without hurting or losing him well I
have been in situation before twice in
my life I think all me no primary school
high school doesn't count in my
situation
the first one it was kind of awkward I
just said I'm really sorry that you got
that impression but I really through
thought we were friends and it sounds so
horrible saying it out loud it's like no
unfortunately sometimes your niceness
can be interpreted as flirting I've been
there before and it's very hard because
you do care about them but you just
don't see yourself like romantically
interested in them and the only thing
that you can do is communicate and be
honest and please don't be around the
bush and be like yes but sorry but I
just straight up you gotta say you know
I'm not the right girl for you we're
really great friends but there's someone
else out there for you to suit you're
better than me you have to leave it at
that like no like oh no oh my god like
just say it and then be done with it and
he will either get really embarrassed
and really hurt and disappear or if he's
very mature I feel like okay cool it's
totally up to like what the guys like
but yeah it is
very awkward situation I've been on the
other side of the situation as well so I
know how it feels on both ends but being
rejected you just got to suck it up and
be like okay okay it's fine it's fine
it's it's not a fireman it's like not I
mean what's your favorite guilty
pleasure TV show or snack one of my
guilty pleasure TV shows is on at the
moment so I've been watching every
single week and just oh I don't know why
I love it so much but I'm obsessed with
all the MTV shows so I'm obsessed with X
on the beach right now I love you know
Geordie Shore I loved what was the Welsh
one p'malee easy as the valleys I love
the valleys I just love laughing at
people that are really drunk miss not
make any sense I sit there on the couch
in my pajamas and I'm like I'm younger
than you guys and I seem like more my
favorite snack is either the big the big
massive size a table top top cooked our
own table room table Aaron Wow that
really couldn't get out and could it I
love that that's chocolate I also love
popcorn like any flavor salted butter
whatever with Maltesers in it like
melted and oh my god I can't dog well
since I'm on a diet right now also
College taught me to go popcorn all
about that it's amazing it's the
best-tasting thing ever so I really need
to change a question cause I'm getting
really hungry craving yeah yeah how do
you stay positive through old hate love
you so much love you too um honestly
ignorance is bliss don't look at it
don't read it if you do see it block it
remove it end of story
I'm fine with constructive criticism
fine you know very very very happy to be
told constructive criticism in a nice
way not in a nasty way what was my eyes
Dana's like but the hague
very cute Achilles oh so ugly ah
whatever
if I don't know you personally I'm going
to take it personally
end of story what's something that makes
you feel super and nostalgic that is an
amazing question that is such a good
question I actually managed to wait
about this not too long ago
um the Disney soundtrack playlist that I
haven't Spotify is like the nostalgia
from that is insane I mainly get
nostalgia from music so if I hear songs
from like Ocarina of Time Zelda Pokemon
games Disney movies I instantly feel
like a very strange emotion it's like
nostalgia but it's like your heart hurts
a little bit because you're kind of
realizing that you're old now and you're
not going to experience it over again
and then time is ticking away and he was
just getting older and life slowly
slipping out of your hands and um anyway
I'm just I'm just kidding it smells it's
weird it's really weird how you can be
like in a shopping center or summer in
public and you look past someone it
sounds wearing a perfume or something or
they have a candle lit and instantly you
have a like that's a raver kind of
flashback thing and you're just like
whoa I'm five years old again like it's
so weird how that can happen
oh I know actually when I am in England
and I see the snow and I see Christmas
lights on the houses and really random
when I see the bubbles falls on the tree
on the Christmas tree like Christmas
decorations on a Christmas tree and the
smell of Christmas literally is the most
overwhelming nostalgic feeling just
seeing Christmas decorations in a shop
make my heart feel very weird like I
can't describe it it's kind of like the
child inside of you that's died I can
say is it like a nice way wow that is
depressing let's my god here is the last
question what's the one major thing that
scares you when getting older that is a
good question
I am getting older it's my birthday on
the 4th of November guys and got me 22
it's not that old
but it's it's older I'm not like 16
anymore ah thing that scares me the most
in all honesty is that I won't have
settled down yet by my thirties just my
personal idea of life I would love love
to have my first child in my late 20s my
second child when I'm 30 or in my early
thirties and obviously like you're
married before then as I'm someone who
you should believe in marriage Prosecco
my parents being married and they're
still married and I'm very lucky that I
have that view on life but it is very
unrealistic I know in these days but I
hope you pray that within the next few
years of my life I'll come across
someone and that loves me and wants to
be with me forever and wants to settle
down me as a family with me because that
would be amazing and in a way that's the
one thing that I want out of life more
than anything is a beautiful marriage
and beautiful children
so that's the one thing that kind of
scares me I'm enjoying being single um
21 I mean come on I'm 21 but at the same
time a lot of my friends getting engaged
a lot of my friends are getting married
I love my friends having kids I'm kind
of like I'm not young anymore
am I like I'm going to baby showers now
this is very strange
so my biggest fear is that I won't ever
find someone and then if I do maybe it's
too late to have kids or something that
would just get worse so my future
husband if you're out there I find me
sometime in the next few years because I
love to meet you then yeah
so at the end of my Q&amp;amp;A if your
questions are answered and let me know
in the comments and I'm going really
brain-dead right now what time is it
10:15 p.m. that would be wise
thank you guys for watching so by my
mood I was a little bit like Oh today
but I'll be all so much and I'll see you
all very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
