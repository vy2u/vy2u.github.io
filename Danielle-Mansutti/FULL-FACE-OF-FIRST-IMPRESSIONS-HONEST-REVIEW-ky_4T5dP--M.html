I'm actually sitting from my mirror I
just got it actually loved it
I'm obsessed and I have so many new
products to try for a first impression
so I thought I would film that for you
today
take a shout out in the world to
Disneyland Paris who saw that oh sure on
the right okay saw that I had my e is
destroyed by certain pug lips so they
have sent me new these I'm so happy
thank you guys so much
so my primer today I'm going to use the
al glass number 28 primer serum this is
the one if you watch my LA vlogs that
Talia was like obsessed with because the
smell is so good so I haven't actually
tried this I tried there hourglass
mineral primer it's like right there but
my god it smells so good like literally
yum sounds gonna love my things it feels
so like velvety and smooth so continuing
on with the our boss theme I have to
watch this just to see if I was color
matched to it and loved it this is the
hourglass a world of writing it's so
small
stick around a oh really but the
actual name was the full name of it
it's like veil something on a mirror
after link everything in description as
always but this one is in shade beige
which is actually super dark but because
I turn off with my SEC turn
I'll see how we go so I have literally
no idea how you're supposed to apply a
stick foundation but I'm just going to
go ahead and cover my face in it in
which you like over there so I'm just
going to my Beauty Blender I don't know
if you're meant to use like a brush the
stick foundation because I honestly have
never worn one before like properly mmm
you're like that's taking it all
literally brush
when they're not applying enough I'm so
confused okay I just feel like it's
coming off oh actually know what I'm
blending this end it's really pretty
wow it's like it's very very skin like
it's not like how my foundation it just
looking like how my skin is really good
right I'm still going to brush anyways
just to see the difference just see
there is any difference I don't know I
don't know what our last products their
products are mainly more for like a
natural look anyway more so than like
was it how much makeup I'm wearing it's
more like do I just have really
naturally beautiful see no am i wearing
myself kind of my coat
so I staged I really like it I feel like
it complements my skin really well done
I was white dollars on my lips so weird
okay okay so the color is great it is
not as high coverage as I'm used to I'm
used to wearing like a lot more of like
a suitable coverage foundation so this
for me is quite different because I'm
normally used to like a lot more things
being completely covered so I'm gonna
lose a bit more concealer underneath my
eyes and stuff so make sure that that
bits covered these new lights on this
mirror I like so warm and drunk thanks
for you so I'm going to jump over to
concealer I'm going to use the Smashbox
to do skin at 24-hour waterproof
concealer oh my god concealer packaging
is so nice when you have a music before
it's actually clean whoa okay so this is
much darker just making sure that I use
as you guys probably know I usually use
like concealer which is why did you like
my skin but God is pretty it is actually
adding that coverage that I was missing
just underneath my eyes I just have a
thing about my under eyes because
personally my under eyes are like so
veiny and like purple which is pretty
hot but I definitely need you know
something to cover them like literally
not creased in what so
or till guess it's time to do my
eyebrows I will just you just better
while I do it because of this mixed
explore levels I really many step
precisely my brow pencil which is my
benefit
Talia loves this I already have it
really heated myself before I'm not
really a big fan of for our pencils but
my brows look amazing with it so how do
you actually get this out am I doing
wrong way why is he coming
Oh would you like wow that's amazing
hello anyways so I'm gonna use this in
the shade for I'm pretty sure that was
so I'm just going to go ahead and pop
this on my brow oh my god brow pencil
feels like it's been so long since I
used one oh my god this spring to that
clip my old days seriously we're going
to feel like I've never felt in an
eyebrow before like what am i doing is
also a shape I must clean this up a lot
with my concealer the product itself is
like gliding on so well but my technique
using a pencil is pretty damn awesome
let's be honest the brows are done so
the pass itself I would say is really
good the only thing and I might just
increase the light a little bit so the
only thing which personally I don't
think that I'm going to make a switch to
brow pencil personally I think that I'm
a pomade gel kind of gal yes that's done
finally and I'm so excited with the next
part oh I was so excited because I'm
going to be using the naked heat palette
I have never used it before I'm so
excited
look at that seems like you actually
scratch from the top line very progress
trying to destroy the cover there but
look at that untouched making heat
palette they've had so many mixed
reviews online to which I learnt that I
shouldn't believe everything that I read
or hear online I should just judge
things based on my own experience
because i swatched the power
in Sephora in LA with Talia and you guys
would have seen that in a vlog and we
were just blown away by the pigmentation
like we were like this can't be a same
pilot we still like water soft whitter
about but it was seeing as it is I make
it heat palette it looks like that is
going to do a warm tone eyeshadow for
once oh my god who have ever thought me
doing warm toned eyeshadow revolutionary
I'm sorry if you don't want to see me do
another warm to an eyeshadow I'm sorry
but I just really want to try this
palette so I currently do much else then
I'm going to start with this one here
called sauce as my transition I've
watched a tutorials on the heat pal
actually I watched like any Shiraz in
general I know you're watching this now
and I thank you so much for that but and
you like me where you watch more vlogs
and tutorials sisters because I'm sure
you guys know that I richly have been
hardly posting any makeup videos and if
you don't follow me on Instagram or
snapchat Twitter or anything I've
explained on there sort of what was
going on for me so I lost a lot of
motivation and passion with makeup I'm
not sure why I think it's just because
the community in general the beta
community I just didn't agree with a lot
of things that was only mental things
that were being said about people and it
just got an urgency well with me so I
just kind of distance myself from the
community and therefore lost a bit of a
passion for selling makeup tutorials and
I found that before I film a makeup
tutorial I'd let you like sit down and
watch so many youtubers and their
tutorials and then feel sad because I
didn't have to kind of set up that they
had or I don't know it like I just felt
crap and I noticed that every single
time that I posted a makeup tutorial you
get more negative comments about your
appearance because that was like what we
were looking at so I was just like ah
screw it I'm going to blog for a bit and
I really really really love to enjoy
doing blogs and I've been doing them for
months now but going oh my brush is
fighting everywhere going to LA recently
literally like ignited a fire within my
soul the makeup video and I was like
they just want to sell my makeup store I
had this like burning desire to fill
makeup store and over the next few weeks
you may see me feel more makeup style
videos because all my little sweating so
much my lip stopped I had a moment where
I was like oh my god I miss doing makeup
so much I feel like it maybe went off
and so for with Tyler and I was like I
miss that let's use this one it looks
very nice but essentially I don't know I
just feel like being surrounded by oh my
god okay my dad being around you know
youtubers and makeup people again it
just made me feel like I miss it so bad
so yeah that's basically how it is but I
find that I don't really watch Beauty
youtubers anymore and like I'm a big
YouTube watcher like I spend so much
time everyday on YouTube and normally
like when I'm eating breakfast or eating
lunch whatever and I find like living
alone
watching me YouTube is like even just
having it on the background it's nice to
just kind of have like a voice playing
and that sounds so lonely but you know
what I mean and I get just nice to have
some background noise I like just like
putting on vlogs and just sort of like
clearing my house with that in the
background and stuff so yeah I don't
particularly have makeup styles on the
background so not really like watching
them that make sense so I've been
listening to podcasts and stuff too but
what are your thoughts on that what kind
of video in your favourites to watch at
the moment because yeah I love blogs and
bloggers love them so I just pulled that
darker shade and I'm now going to mmm i
dont know realy either look can you see
it there you go one of these two yes
that's scorch order talk so I think I
like what score it some lurid fire I'll
see how it looks with better talk so
let's see how to scorch look all my law
that is so pretty
why am i eating the wrong hand I don't
get what we do it I like this
I like this I thought Scott should be
way more pink but it's actually really
really warm I used to have a makeup geek
shadow which was like this exact color
as i favorite makeup each other in the
world and then it smashed every hours on
the flight sounds are happy that i have
something with some soup now because oh
my god this is Friday so I'll just blend
that out a little bit as well you think
B oh it's a double not G so he double
shade and then I was a concealer to
clean up all this excess the subscribing
the same concealer from the fall and
we're just going to clean up the line
there we go for my mascara today I'm
going to use this kick I'm Alana extra
sculpt Volume Mascara hardly ever use
anything Kiko but I'll give it a go and
my oh my god my lashes right now I'm so
bad because when you get a last lift
which is when I like time at the coat
when I drop because it's been like seven
weeks or so since I got my last lash
lift that's so gross right now they're
like little spiders legs and they're
going like every single direction and
they just I'll do my lower lash line
when I've done my lower lash line I
shadow which will be past the powders
well well hmm this is guys okay it's
just that it's not really making me very
long as it is time for the powder
I will seem to get this really
attractive foundations I hope I lose but
II see powder we're going to use this
Smashbox photo photo photo filter powder
foundation in size which look like me I
can't seem to find my beloved nas beach
powder anywhere so I bought this at
Sephora
and hopes that it will actually measure
up
I just really who has been discontinued
because I literally can't buy the NARS
press powder anywhere anymore
I'm so sad this is adding a bit of extra
coverage as well which is a lightness
the patter is on and I'm now going to be
toothpaste baked to luminous glow
bronzer which I don't believe I I have
actually used before as you can see if
it's looking pretty damn untouched I've
all want to try but the packaging is
just so pretty that I just I've never
even considered using it on my face just
because it's so pretty to look at if
that makes any sense
I'm assuming it would be too dark it
doesn't look hmm yeah I'll need a lot so
I was going through as always bring it
up to my flat and then down my cheeks
always stop it like the center of your
eye
the golden rule where is quite nice and
glowy is a little bit patchy so this is
my powder over that a little bit
salute hmm
my whole face just looks a bit more
patchy than I'm used to I don't know if
it's the foundation or the crime ayah
but or just really sweaty in
front of the lights but normally my skin
does look a bit more like color than
this
like it just looks a bit but and for my
highlights a I'm going to use this
hourglass ambient effect stroke alike
noting that they were so lovely to get
to me I've only watched this have now
actually worn it on my skin war is
pretty it's so much more like silvery
then highlights that I use ages like
kind of golden highlights you say so why
do you like this with my nose looks
shiny we're going to finish off the
eyeshadow portion a mini is scorched
once again documented as insane
seriously
yes love it something to use the same
car from before but on my lower lashes
now now I'm going to go ahead and use
this two-faced hangover 3 in 1 prime set
refresh it is the replenishing prime own
setting spray which yep so it department
or since I've tried to see a box I don't
want oh just squirting right almost all
that smells good yeah well good I
thought my face is so wet
huh hmm oh my god no just ruin
everything
no no no no no no no no no no no no no
no our face looks so what abort mission
abort mission abort mission
I came ahead a little bit of an issue it
was like basically I was saying I don't
know if it's the foundation or what but
because I am half faced water which
isn't the best thing in the world
register on other when I sweat and also
when I put on that spray it just looks
like I don't water like my face and now
I don't really get that with with
carnations but anyway when we went to
the our grafts event in LA it was for a
new secret weapon which was their new
lipsticks and I have not yet oh no very
good it isn't one I have not yet tried
the range but isn't it just insane I'm
so excited
so the way that this works is that they
are refillable lipstick and I'd love to
do like a lipstick swatch video on
things is that something you guys would
like to see I'd be more and over to do
that
so basically yet it looks like this you
open it up so you remove the lipstick
and you put it into this golden one and
it's great because it means you have to
throw away like nice packaging you can
always keep the golden part it's just
like refills so we go ahead and want my
lips kiss or a bit foundation II oh
let's just do this
pigmentation oh my god so creamy and so
I start with applying but my god this is
nice oh my god my gold and here is all
the makeup on my face and oh my god I'm
seriously shocked I mean like shocked
with those lipsticks literally like oh
my god you saw when I put it on like how
it glided on like it was just like hello
and you guys know how like I am at the
tartlets main so it's good to find
something new for a change for me so my
hair is currently stuck to my lips
that's always a really sexy look but
let's go through what I put on and what
my honest opinion is of each one so we
started with the hourglass foundation
and I'm not sure if it is the foundation
or if it is the primer or what but for
some reason it just sort of exchanged on
me the thing is a really weird though is
that when i swatched it I took it when I
went out for like dinner with Tyler and
her mom and my mum a few weeks ago and
her like you guys care about that but
here you go
and it looks really nice when I had like
more like a natural glowy look on
basically all I did was that I put a
little bit my face and I like actually
worked it in with my hands because what
I really like so we really class it is
like actually wearing it properly like
I've never actually worn it with a full
face of makeup and seeing how it lasts
and how it works so it's been
interesting to see how it works with
other products on the face but I
definitely tried again in a different
circumstance that I'm not sweating Jeff
from lightbulbs literally looks like
this so the foundation is undetermined I
love the color of it love it but I don't
love it as much as my Urban Decay one
however I do think there's potential and
I have found with a lot of my
foundations the first time that I try
them I don't like too much love again I
love them it's really weird I don't
understand why that happens but if
things happen a lot and then the
Smashbox concealers afterwards love it
absolutely love it all I can say so
creamy so easy the blend like so good
and then after that was the eyebrow
pencil which the eyebrow pencil for Moe
itself great glide on so well
if you like pencil give it a shot why
not for me our pencil isn't really my
thing I'm just going to keep using gels
because I found it quite difficult to
apply because I'm just not used to it
then after that was the eyes and I am
obsessed obsessed with the naked heat
palette which I never thought I would
say kids like people say really weird
things about it and I love it
what is wrong with it it's so good that
how can anyone say anything bad about it
and Richard I understand it's like
really good I'm just like why was it so
much controversy over I just I don't
know but anyway that was awesome powder
is fine I mean I'm creasing though which
my nos doesn't do for me but drugs
powder is a great color really love the
color of it then we did the bronze are
not super thrilled with it I just don't
know it's a bit in my opinion not really
great probably will needs it again the
packaging is awesome
socially difficult then we did the
highlight which has faded a bit not as
good as my Oprah highlights but
definitely something which I will still
wear which I want like a more silvery
based highlight why was I going to say
eyelid what a dog after that we moved on
to the
it's got oriental works our scarf
formula it's really good the Kiko
mascara formula they know what they're
doing but the wand mm-hmm
not a fan too big too bulky couldn't get
into a little bit of my eyes what the
formula it sounds really good I might
put like a different one to it and just
need some formula because the formula
was sick then do did the primer spray
smell really good the Too Faced hangover
promise racer like coconut loved it then
the lips obsessed literally obsessed and
I don't wear lipstick because I hate the
transcriber but it's looking pretty good
don't transfer though well can you see
that definitely does transfer so it's
one thing to consider because I wear
liquid lipsticks mostly so it doesn't do
this but yeah I think that transmits
quite a lot which is a bit of a shame
because it's definitely something that I
wouldn't wear for like long events or
long knives I just work for like very
simple dinners or meetings or something
something which I don't have to ensure
that it's on all day it's so annoying
because this home is so good I just wish
that it did transfer because that's like
anyway overall I think my makeup looks
very similar to how it would look with
my hologram products which is great
because I didn't use anything which I
normally so it's great to be able to
make this kind of look without using
those products
what was that those hold on those
products hmm
can't speak right now this if you like
this new lens then you might assign and
the new mirror thing and then let me
know before you go I am uploading over
the next few weeks on Wednesdays and
Sundays at 7 a.m.
London time which is about 4 p.m. in
Australia 11 p.m. in LA so obviously you
guys on Wednesday and have a brilliant
day why</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
