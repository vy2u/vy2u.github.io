today we are doing a full face of first
impressions I haven't filmed everything
like this in the longest time I'm so
excited we have stuff like Oprah nas do
your heaps of to face some huda beauty
why so our class but I'm very excited to
get stuck into this without further ado
let's dive into it the headband is on
which means we are getting front in
business right now I'm gonna start by
using the earth for a cool as a cucumber
primer now it says is a moisturizer
primer in one that hydrates smooths and
soothe so I'm very excited to see how
this goes I haven't actually ever used
an open primer I don't think it's very
blue that does smell like you come back
it's quite thick feeling as well very
thick it a bit tacky all work with it oh
my god I literally have all the feels
about this next product if you could be
watching me long enough you would know
how obsessed I used to be with the NARS
sheer glow and the nas the long wearing
one I sweat all the time this one is the
natural radiant alum wear foundation and
I am in Barcelona I'm so happy to show
you names are like the same as like the
sheer glow on so I knew exactly which
one would suit me because Barcelona was
like my one true love I loved it nation
you guys have no idea like no idea I
just haven't used a nice foundation in
like the longest time and it's weird
because like I wonder why you just kind
of stopped using certain color love it
you just stop using certain makeup
products I think it's just because you
discover and you wanted to stop it
remember why I loved you so much just
covered up all my redness like so well I
love it okay time to cover the whole
face make myself look a bit more at Lisa
Simpson s cuz it is a little bit y'all
over there to get my neck is like yellow
I'm literally just so happy about this
another good foundation I keep finding
so many good foundations the minute it's
just like amazing amazing okay so let's
zoom you into the eye portion now
sir my eyebrows sound because I never
use like a pencil or anything I always
use a pomade so this is the hourglass
arch brow sculpting pencil we'll give it
a go be happy oh it's first impression
so I'm gonna oh wait it's a pencil rice
you gotta go should to be fair it is
quite natural isn't it so I just I don't
know I think it's because I'm just not
used to pencil but I think they look ok
for the most part look kinda normal I
suppose I just felt like I didn't have
as much control over the fade or
anything like I do with a pomade but
we'll work with it and then if it's too
thick we could always like shape it out
later on so I'm thinking now I might
just jump straight to the eyes now that
were already zoomed in nice and close
anyway for my eyes I'll be using this BH
Cosmetics Zodiac palette it looks so
sick I'm gonna do something a little bit
different today I'm thinking kind of
like in the realm of blues and purples
or greens just kind of mix it up a
little bit I'll let you know I was like
which one I'd pick but I think I'm gonna
start with this one on my crease and
then blend it out with one of these as
well I'm gonna use a morphe and 502 I'm
gonna start with that pinky shade and
just work it in here and kind of blend
it upwards towards my eyebrows because
we'll use this as the shade to blend out
too but I'm just feeling like doing
something extra because I mean why not
I do lots a couple looks I get told that
I do a couple look so let's do something
really different ones I'm not taking
that purple shade and I'm just gonna
brush this over the top but not blend it
as far outwards is that pink and then
that's done a lot of color so I'm gonna
go in with a brush from before and just
blend it in with that pink shade and
then with the deeper purple shade I'm
just gonna concentrate this primarily on
my crease itself I'm just gonna go in
again blend that through alright we've
now changed the background to purple I'm
gonna use a little bit of touch
tape in fair I'm just going to pop that
on my eyelid like literally teeny tiny
little amount and with a concealer brush
I'm just going to place this over my lid
and create the illusion of a cut crease
I'm now going to take this shade here
called Libra we're going to pop that all
over the Zulu it's just such a beautiful
foil shade and then I'm gonna take Leo
and I'm just gonna pop this in the
center of my lid I think I'm gonna test
out the concealer now so I can clean up
these edges this is a do your skin
forever undercover concealer nobody's
ass never seen this in my life so I'm
excited to see how it is anything I've
ever really used to your over on my
channel but I was recently sent this and
I was like no I'm gonna set that with
this two-faced peach perfect powder as
you know I love the poorness whey powder
I have not used to this one before
though why never smelled like patients
I'm sure it will
I can admit oh my god is very nice it's
a piece to have more of color to it and
the bonus whey powder the bonus whipped
butter is just super transparent this
one looks slightly peachy so it's a
little bit pink toned but it's still
fantastic so basically I assume this is
just the exact same on this way but just
a different shade for it makes such a
difference to conceal literally I could
not live without to face ball this way
powder it is my everything
I kinda want to use the Urban Decay
heavy metal eyeliner now if I do purple
that might just kind of disappear into
the eyes I'll give it a go just want to
see if it would add anything to look at
my new year as well
this is quite pretty
barskaya minis this or ylm Moscato look
beautiful I will just give it a play
that is my thigh bike move why is it the
I never get a text and then I sit down I
do work for a few hours and everyone is
like hey guys my mascara is her noise I
really like it I've been using benefits
bad girl bang like Luke's really ever
since the Modi's trip that was our guys
changed I swear actually the first time
I used to honestly like I'm just putting
on next to Tyler in the bathroom on our
last there the moldings I just didn't
get it I was thinking like am i doing it
wrong I don't understand it felt a
little bit clumpy and then I realized I
wasn't really applying it the wrong way
it's meant to be light and I wasn't
really lying or anything like that and
then when I kind of I think I washed
Karen who's so sorry on Instagram I
watched her story cuz Tyler showed it to
me and she applied it so differently
than I was doing in her lashes right and
then I tried it that way and I was like
my god now I could not stop wearing that
girl bang it's just but I figured I
couldn't use it in this video today
because if you can using it like every
single day for two weeks so that would
be a bit of a lie would really be a
first impression because I work all the
time I'm like in love with that mascara
I'm feeling all kinds of washed out
right now I just feel like I need some
Sun please it's been snowing here all
week so you look Brown this is the Too
Faced unicorn tears iridescent mystical
bronzer smells are really nice as well
honestly to face and that smells you
just they're unbeatable so so good just
reminds me a lot of chocolate so they're
actually it's actually not as
glowy it actually kind of looks Matt
doesn't it doesn't look very like you're
a doesn't maybe I need to actually like
put my brush on the unicorn maybe
make a difference no really I do love
the color though I just thought it would
have a different finish on it it's
actually really nice it's growing on me
a lot it's kind of like just super
blendable goosing blendy blendy blendy
and for highlight and we test out the
unicorn dream stick now I'm very
skeptical about how strong this will be
but I'm just gonna pop it on give it a
blend and we'll see so yeah that's what
I thought
so because it's a stick it's very subtle
so it's nice if you're someone that
likes natural very like very can I like
my highlight being like you know
sunglasses look at my highlight kind of
thing so from the front you can't
actually see it but it's only from the
side catching the light yeah it's not
strong off pretty though very pretty if
you're just doing like natural victory
like you don't want people to know
you're wearing makeup makeup just like
you want a nice glow 100% for that but
the full face of purple eyeshadow and
glittery eyeliner
not quite you know I'm actually give
this cover drop become a truck got my FX
glitter drops I go I've used their other
you know these little ones the little
custom enhance and drops all the time
but they can let it drop I'm not sure oh
my god it's actually blue anyway let's
try and blend this out okay I get Jay
blending now I'm gonna highlight middle
like a slough okay so are we liking it I
think it's nice however it definitely
suits this makeup look I don't know if
it would see
just because it's so blueish I'll see
I'll see if flushes unneeded I guess I
was sent these everyone done sister my
hey I'm visually cool I was sent these
Michael Kamen number nine now they like
hectic just super super big you know we
go um oh these are hard to get out just
so much packaging right
oh line things up you'll see haven't
used eyelash brunt of the mine and like
years and I'm already regretting this
it's just the band is so thick compared
to my lashes this intently a long time
so I put them on alright let's do it
let's do what do we do I always think
this in my tutorials and so I prefer you
I'm just using like the GI glue a little
less do it let's get the last we it's
now time to do lower lashes they feel so
heavy on me I'm not used to writing
lashes with you this heavy and thick so
I'm a little bit like what see anything
nope I'm gonna grab a small tapered
blending brush I'm gonna start by using
that pink shade that we used first
originally on eyes blend everything out
I'm just gonna place that on my lower
lash line find it so I want to talk
whenever I do eyes I noticed when I edit
as well I'm always like so now I'm
coming to apply it my my so dramatic
it's crazy
okay now I'm gonna grab a small brush
like a pencil brush and I'm gonna use
the dark purple shade I'm gonna really
really really tightly pop this and then
we're just gonna add that those be
I'm just gonna add some oh this is
really good for your lashes so now we
have to do lips and move to spritz the
toothpaste festival refresh I believe
this is like a setting spray or a
refreshment spray some sorts I'm just
gonna use it I think won't kind of screw
up was the makeup but we shall see I'm
very interested to see oh Jesus that's
like watery really really really watery
careful if you're using that one like
normal water proof makeup that's alright
that's thick I think of it is this
morphe one I mean it kind of like goes
with the oils I think make sure they
could go either way but hmm oh it's like
super metallic as well so this is lit
she ended up like so vampy I love it I
actually am super super happy with the
products that I used to I want that
money that stood out to me that I really
dislike Percy probably won't use for Too
Faced to highlight stick pretty good I
know that I personally wouldn't wear
these eyelashes again I'm not just
saying like cuz I have my lunch brand
I'm saying it because I'm not useless
being this thick and this heavy my eyes
just keep watering a lot
I just I'm used to Rome my own brand so
my own brands a lot lighter on my eyes
on this side it's kind of irritating me
a little bit besides that and the
highlight stick I actually like it and
surprisingly really like the lips I
thought the lips would be like Oh God
it's just that a nose so not that kind
of makeup I normally wear so I'm just
kind of like God who is this person this
is so weird
but I think the absolute star of the
show the one product that blew me away
more than anything else was the NARS
foundation I absolutely love it where is
he where is over here literally in love
with this guy I'm gonna be using this
obviously so much more because I feel
like this is my perfect shade like
Barcelona nose always been a good shape
me
because effect and that I wear it just
matches really well so I will definitely
be using this foundation a lot more in
the future I might just make it purple
in the background again because hey I
just feel more like on brand when it's
behind me this is really fun to feel on
first impression with you guys I hope
you enjoyed it and until next time guys
