stuff when it was winter and stranded
but I'm that call that I want to I need
a coat to film I'm freezing
hey guys welcome back to my channel I
asked you to ask me some questions on
Twitter using the hashtag fan city ass
and I'm not gonna do bro internet
systems straight into the questions so
the first question is why don't you own
a pod yet probably one of the most asked
questions did you guys know I've now
moved out I don't have a pug yet because
I'm doing a bit of traveling those in
the next few months and I don't want to
have a responsibility of looking after
plug until I have like a long time at
home and not to keep putting it like in
kennels and little like dog holiday
places or in the cold but whenever the
time comes for me to have a lot of time
at home then it trust me you'll see a
little pug walking out I'll be vlogging
much when I get a pod codes you will
know when I get one how long were we
doing YouTube for like until what age I
am planning to be doing YouTube until
I'm 80 years old lying in bed doing my
knitting and doing my jigsaw puzzles and
stuff and vlogging about my day like I
want to do it for as long as I possibly
can I do know that YouTube isn't going
to be around forever like anything it
has pink and it'll probably like crash
one day so that's why I want to make the
most of it now while I'm here and I'm
like loving it as my job and all that
stuff but I will be doing it for as long
as I possibly can and when I get married
when I have kids and be so awesome I can
still vlog would you like to do a tour
to meet your families I love you so much
- I definitely would I mean I've never
done a meet-up yet because I feel like I
can't really do one unless it's
organized by a company if I went to a
certain place and I told you guys I'm
gonna be here at this certain time there
could be some people
they're for the wrong reasons if you
know what I mean and they're just I
don't know and it's not controlled and
it's a sorta was scary that kind of
scenario so I definitely think I would
love to do a made up first before doing
at or anything like I doubt I'd ever be
in a position to do that but if I was
that would be amazing and the biggest
thing to me is meeting you guys and be
friends with you guys so I would
definitely take up an opportunity for
that in the future what's your best way
to get away from the social media world
this is actually something I want to do
an entire video on social media isn't
real life I mean you can capture moments
and that's fine but at the end of the
day we all try and betray ourselves to
be who you want to be on social media
and in reality we might be quite
different that's just the way that it is
I think social media because true
consumed by it it can become very
dangerous and just take over your entire
life that ultimately leads you to living
in like two different personas like your
online persona and your real life
persona something that I don't know if
you guys notice like when I first
starting my videos I wasn't really
myself in my videos because I felt like
I had to sort of be really polished and
my formal I don't know like I just had
to be like a professional version of
myself but the more that I film the more
comfortable I am with just being myself
I had Nicki say this with her cousin
desi I think it was that video it was so
true she said if you think I've changed
on YouTube it's actually because I'm
being more myself than I used to be this
is not relate to the question is it I
need a like I wrap this up pretty quick
so what I do is around 5 p.m. most
nights I will shut down everything I
will turn my phone off I will turn off
my computers and turn off anything
that's connected to the Internet
turn it off and have some time like my
family has some time with my friends
without like taking snapchat photos of
my food or anything like that and just
sort of leave you know in the real world
for a bit I think it's so healthy to
distance yourself from social media
sometimes what you make is a great thing
it's not a bad thing
it can be dangerous though if you get
too
immersing it is what I'm trying to say
but I definitely feel like you need that
time for yourself what has been your
favorite song recently I love you what
are your favorite and least favorite
things about living alone so far now
it's been almost two weeks since I
sounded living alone I think my favorite
thing about it is just the freedom like
everything is yours you don't feel bad
because something's place to the wrong
place or anything like that like you
placings what you want them to be and
things like buying cutlery is exciting
like it's just crazy I think it's great
to always have company you know always
have someone around and I might have
quicker with me soon oh and lastly we
have how do you deal with fake friends
oh don't you just love them check you
love them really they met few times okay
I think guys the most important thing is
never feel guilty about removing toxic
people from your life someone is in your
life and all they seem to do is bring a
lot more negativity to positivity a lot
more drama than fun you need to just let
them go I feel like now the older that
I'm getting them why I'm realizing it is
so important to let go but I feel so bad
for it but then in the long run I think
oh thank God that I'm not having to deal
with someone that is purposely using me
for something or doesn't have my best
interests at heart
your friends are meant to support you
your friends are meant to be there for
you they meant to encourage you and the
most important things your friends are
meant to ask you how you are and how
you're doing and if they do not do that
sometimes you got to think why am I in
this friendship you know what am I
getting from it if you feel like you're
doing way too much for them than they
are for you you know it's really
difficult but sometimes it's just worth
having quality over quantity and that's
why I can quite openly admit I have only
a few really good friends I do not have
a lot of friends because I feel like
it's very important to know that you can
trust your friends and know that they
are there for you if I really wanted to
I could try my hardest to be joining in
like a really massive friendship group
but I just feel like every single time
I've been there there's always someone
that stabs you in the back or uses you
there's always drama especially girls I
know how it is when you know you trust
someone and you know that you guys click
and you get along hold on to that anyone
that you know is fake does anything
behind your back you need to just let
them go and then just be a mature person
that if you see them in person again
be nice to them and say hi don't just
like ignore them or anything you just
don't like the way that I treated you
but you're quite happy to be civil with
them and and that's it so I hope you
guys look after yourself please don't
just hold on to fake friends because you
need friends you will find amazing
friends one day don't hold on to people
that make you feel crap please I really
hope that you guys enjoyed that Q&amp;amp;A I
love gonna make you a nice for you guys
and I'll see you really soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
