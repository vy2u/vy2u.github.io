Channel today I've done an autumn e full
makeup tutorial because I seem to
confuse a lot of people when I did a
spring tutorial about two weeks ago and
everyone was like but it's not spring
it's full it's autumn and I'm like but I
live in Australia I have done an awesome
tutorial for you guys today it's just I
totally winged it today
I just wanted to stick with golden and
red tones because I felt it was very
awesome me if you would like to get this
finished look then just keep watching
so now it's going to pop on the headband
and I'm going to be using a foundation
today which I haven't actually tried yet
so it's gonna be interesting I do have a
few blemishes at the moment so I'm going
to just wing it with this foundation I
am gonna go right through the five steps
quite quickly today as always I do have
my full routine on one if you do want to
see it out this yeah and I'm just going
to be using my look the names gun
Australis for my foundation with SPF 30
I've seen it doing the rounds on YouTube
so I feel like I might give it a go so
it's a little like army or something so
we think oh my fans know like just
kidding we're going with my Real
Techniques buffing brush and just sort
of see what
this has got an incredibly high coverage
which is good today because I'd be
breaking out sets with me what I need so
it's a little bit pink for me but you
can't see it on the camera - it does
look quite pink so the coverage of this
foundation is like unbelievable so high
coverage so it's definitely a foundation
that I would use to an event or
something which I need long lasting
because it seems like it would last all
day and all night because I want this to
be more about the eyes on the lips so
I'm just gonna run through all of these
steps now I'm gonna go in with the Sun
bronze bronzer and I've lost the top of
the bronzer so I will hunt it and Link
it the lines dead okay so I'm just gonna
do as always contour my cheekbones I
normally put bronzer over my eyelids as
well to make me look a little bit fuller
and on my temples so I'm going to run
through its really quickly because yet
this tutorial about the eyes and stuff
so
and next going in with my Maybelline 24
a super-state service day yeah superstar
24 concealer I'm going to be doing a
triangle underneath my eyes like this
and then I'm going to take my ELF
well this concealer brush and just blend
it out so I must say that I'm absolutely
so happy with this foundation that I use
I was so skeptical about using it but
looking at my skin now it just looks
like refreshed and healthy it costs to
be like $12 as well that's what I was so
skeptical but I mean it just gives me
very natural finish I'm very happy with
it it's a really high coverage as well
so just wanted to leave that in there I
bought this on a whim thinking probably
like really bad wolf always talking it
up yeah it's a great part of the day so
now I'm gonna be going on with the eye
shadow I bought this palette from
Maybelline because it was bright it has
like gold and it has creamy color and I
sort of want to work with the gold but
the full makeup because I would like to
sort of a Goldy reddish
I'm gonna start with this nice creamy
creamy is shiny shimmery shade and I'm
just going to apply this on a very cheap
drugstore brush I'm going to be using
this for the base of my eyes I always
find the biggest thing about using new
eyeshadows is I'm always so scared that
it's gonna be one with so much fallout
and it's the first thing when you've
done all your makeup and then you look
very again you go Pat ever and you know
huh oh my god nice I've got this brush
with this product on it I'm just gonna
use all the excess and just do a line
meaning from sort of the end of my eye
this purpley colored here just on my out
of beat of my eye I'm just gonna be
applying it with this brush and then
I'll be blending it out onto it
and I'm going to use my ELF blending
eyebrows just to make it not so hard to
apply
draw a line underneath my eye then just
make the gold part that I did oh my Mary
sitting in revealeth anyway grabbing a
lot of shade so I'm going to take this
pink shade I'm going to use that on my
outer crease just so that the eyeshadow
blends out a little bit lighter
so using the same color that I use for
my crease I'm just going to use it as a
highlight so I'm just going to put a
little bit on my brush and then just
placing that color underneath my eyebrow
next I'm going to going in with my
models prefer at sort of a golden liquid
eyeliner and I found this in the $2
minute price like so I'm just going to
do a winged eyeliner but with this
golden color just to sort of match the
other corner shades
so today kill my lashes and then put on
a coat of mascara and I'm using mega
flush volume Express from them
Maybelline anyway I'm just gonna put
this on my bottom lashes as well just
wear the dark eyeshadow is
this is all like my legs my robot okay
Zach boy Jeff field oh my god
well that was what happened ever so now
the lashes are on it's time to start
with lipstick and this is the last step
for this tutorial I'm using a lipstick
or go long long red lipstick by
Australis it is in the shade glam and
I'm just going to not line my lips today
because home when I don't have a lip
liner so it's this color it's a nice
sort of deep red almost got some purple
tones in there which I love for this
tutorial so I'm just gonna go ahead and
put this on my lips and then we'll see
what the final look looks like
