today I have done a full / autumn makeup
tutorial I also offered two different
lip options right now during the neutral
nude option and here is the dark version
of this look it is more dramatic but I
do think it suits fall very well so I
really hope that you enjoy this video
today and let's jump straight into it
for the first step I'm using the makeup
geek eyeshadow in creme brulee with the
Sigma diffuse crease diffuse crease 838
brush and this is the most perfect
transition shade of all time so we're
gonna put this above our lids above our
crease and just below the eyebrows
moving on I'm going to use the sleek eye
divine sunset 568 palette and the first
companies from this palette is this
golden shade and I'm using it with a
morphe Envy at 25 brush just in that
same place to put the transition shade
just to add a bit of shimmer to the look
because I want this to be super shimmery
and sparkly and then we're moving on to
this pink shade here and I'm using a
sigma buffing blend a 39 brush and I'm
just adding this into my crease for a
bit more definition and yep so I'm not
gonna try and go too far above the
crease just staying in decreasing this
time and then we are going to move on to
the lid now this is gonna be super
dramatic and it looks so bad when I'm
applying it that trust me at the end
it's worth it so starting with a makeup
geek eyeshadow in drama queen I'm just
going to apply this onto my lids and
pack it on with the Sigma exact blend
e32 brush and then going over it with
corrupt from makeup geek just to add a
lot of darkness what normally happens at
this stage is that you need to do so
much blending and so much adding because
well when your dark colors is always
good fun so what we're gonna do is go
back into the crease with the pink shade
and the golden shade because we've lost
it a little bit and just add those back
on and pack them back into our
transition just to add all the sparkle
I'm using my naked skin Urban Decay
concealer in light warm and
is going to clean up all the fallout and
all the yucky not so neatness neatness
make the lines a bit straighter and more
perfect and then we're just going to go
over the top with the associate Beverly
Hills of banana powder from the contour
kit this is my personal favorite use
whatever powder you want to set the
concealer but I am in love with the
banana pepper and now the next step is
the lower lash line start we're just
going to align our water line with a
black eyeliner pencil Wow I'm struggling
to speak today so I'm just gonna do that
in our water line and straight
afterwards using the same pink shade
that we used in our crease we're just
going to use this on a short shader
brush just below the lash line and then
following that using the dark purple
just very very very close to the lashes
just for a nice little ombre everything
I guess you could say a gradient effect
we're gonna go in with some mascara and
I'm using the Too Faced better than sex
mascara on my top lashes and my teaching
3d magic lash on my bottom lashes well
Howard you know I do it every time and
after that I'm just gonna move on to
falsies I'm using the wanderlust false
lashes from XO bTW these are gorgeous
full natural lashes and I think that
they stick this look really well do you
guys like my head we're just gonna move
on to the face now
now Philips it's the star of the show
this is diva by Mac now you can choose
to just go with a nude lip if that's
what you would prefer I really love the
shade it's like a really rich dark red
shade and I think it just works really
well with the eyeshadow and for the nude
option today I've got 280 rum Ricci by
Maybelline which looks a bit like this
so thank you guys so much for watching
today I really appreciate it as always
also let me know which lip color version
was your favorite and I really hope you
guys have a great week I'll see you
really serious hi today I have my
September favorites so excited to tell
you that sorry these are old Beauty
favorites</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
