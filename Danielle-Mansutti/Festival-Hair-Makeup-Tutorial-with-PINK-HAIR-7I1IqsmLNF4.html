today's video is so much fun and it's so
exciting so as you can see this is a
dying hair pink at home festival
inspired kind of looks because I have
heard amazing things about split hair
online I'm sure you guys have too when
they reach out to me to work together it
was absolutely perfect timing as I
wanted to see what I look like with pink
hair for so long now today I'm trying
out the splat colorize a five-minute
color toning conditioner on camera for
you guys today and I'm so excited to
show it to you I did ask you on snapchat
to screenshot if you'd be interested in
seeing a dying hair home video is wet
hair and the house ins of you
screenshotted it so here it is I've
decided to try out the pink color today
however they do also offer other colors
such as bossy blue and violet vixen when
you're ready to go back blonde you can
shampoo the color out as it lasts 5 to
10 days so now I'm going to show you a
demonstration of the products and go
step by step on how to apply the splat
products according to the directions on
the box it is so so important that you
must wear gloves and make sure to keep
the product away from your eyes please
keep that in mind I'm using the
conditioner on my extensions today so
I'm firstly wetting them I'm not
shampooing them or anything like that
and I'm getting ready to put the
conditioner on and I would suggest
putting something in your sink just to
make sure it won't stain timing was so
perfect for me because the bathroom was
getting renovated the next day so it
really didn't matter in my situation so
as you can see I'm rolling my extensions
into a little ball and then squeezing
the conditioner on and spreading it
evenly throughout the hairs I just
repeated this step over and over and
over again and all the other extensions
and the color like straight away gets on
the hair it's awesome so then after this
I set a timer on my phone for 20 minutes
and I left my extensions on a towel for
20 minutes just that the color could
absorb into the hair and then I rinsed
it out after 20 minutes and you can see
a lot of the colors stayed on the hair
not much came out at all which is so
cool and then I left it on a towel
overnight to dry and now it is time for
a little bit of a festival makeup look
to go with it so starting with the eyes
today I'm using the burnt orange matte
eyeshadow from
Anastasio Beverly Hills and I'm using
this in my crease as a transition shade
and just buffing that in with a big
fluffy brush and then packing on
flamethrower which is a foiled eyeshadow
by makeup geek I have been wearing miss
Li every single day this week I have
fallen in love with it absolutely
obsessed and then after packing that all
over the lid I'm adding fudge by
anastasi Beverly Hills in my outer
corner and then blending it through then
using my NARS creamy concealer I'm just
using this to clean up the wonky edges
on the end of the eyeshadow and I'm
using the benefit roller lash on my
lashes for a coat of mascara before
falsies I'm using the ice while lashes
in glam today I feel like these are
perfect for a festival and just popping
them on my eyes as so before we move on
to contouring using the lorac pro
contour palette I'm using the darkest
shade and I am just using this on my
temples my cheekbones and also to
contour my nose and just below my mouth
as well now using Mac gol deposit and
putting this on my cheeks I thought this
is great for a festival because it's
very glowy
it's just bronzy it's beautiful and then
of course put it on some highlighter
because why not then I'm using that
flame throw shade on a pencil brush and
I'm putting it on my lower lash line and
then blending it out with a fluffy brush
then adding some eyeliner to my
waterline and also a coat of mascara
then using the spice a lip liner by Mac
I'm going to align my lips and then I'm
using the colour-pop ultra matte lip in
the shade Chee all over my lips and the
next step we're going to move on to hair
and I was so happy with the way of my
extensions turned out after using this
flat hair it's such a cotton candy pink
it's so so beautiful tying up different
sections of my hair I'm going to apply
the extensions to my head and I haven't
worn extensions so long so it's really
cool to see my hair really thick again I
always like to start very low from the
bottom and then work my way up and add
the weft higher and higher as I go and
as you can see I was getting pretty
excited about how cool it looks already
and then again just putting up the
middle section and applying some
extensions in there I was just getting
so excited it just looked so cool that
was like I wish this was my real hair
and now I'm putting up the top layer of
my hair and I'm putting two big weft of
extensions on either side of my hair and
you can see how it's really cool now
that it's all sort of faded together
because the extensions are on different
lengths that actually looks really
natural at the bottom of my hair as well
and I'm also putting very short wefts on
the very very very high point of my head
near my partying just to make sure that
blends in with my front bangs as well
and here is the finish hair so beautiful
as so many colors I love it so much so
I'm just straightening it very quickly
to make sure that there are no kinks and
bumps or anything like that and I
actually decided to braid my hair or
plat my hair however you'd like to say
it because I just felt like it looks
really cool it's fun it's festival
friendly and also having different
colors in your hair like this and having
it braided or plat or whatever you want
to say looks so cool like seriously how
cool does that look do I say it again it
looks really cool
then I'm brushing it a few hairs from
the front to make it a little bit
Messier and I'm also pulling out chunks
of hair from the braids to make it messy
and voluminous and that is the finished
a festival hair and makeup I hope you
guys loved it and I will see you very
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
