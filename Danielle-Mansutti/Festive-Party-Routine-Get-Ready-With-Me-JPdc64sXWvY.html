today's beer I'm gonna be sharing with
you a holiday themed party get ready
with me
and of course my routine starts with the
shower so I want to make sure I'm fresh
and clean and fully shaved for the party
I've just discovered this new razor by
sheet which is this chic Hydra silk and
I have to show you guys it because it is
so good so firstly I wet my legs in the
shower then I'm using the hydro silk
sensitive shave gel all over my legs to
make sure they'll be super super super
smooth I've been loving this razor it
seriously hydrates longer than any other
roses and the water activated
moisturizing serum hydrates the skin
throughout each shape and for up to two
hours after shaving it's amazing what I
love is that it is designed specifically
for the contours and curves of a woman's
body and this is perfect for me as I do
my knees to make sure I'll actually not
cut me and it will shave properly before
a party I always use a wash often
because it's just so much easier so now
that my legs are silky smooth and tan
it's time for the makeup and I'm just
going to leave this as self-explanatory
you guys see me do this five million
times so enjoy
you
that is the makeup portion of this video
complete next we are going to move on to
the outfit and beans really wanted to be
a part of this so my legs are feeling
and looking amazing up these in the
Schick Hydro silk razor today and this
is my outfits from house of CB I love
this dress it's so beautiful and so
Christmassy and so flattering Fanny
wanted to come in and show off her
outfit as well and I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I had such fun making
it for you and let's chat in the
comments bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
