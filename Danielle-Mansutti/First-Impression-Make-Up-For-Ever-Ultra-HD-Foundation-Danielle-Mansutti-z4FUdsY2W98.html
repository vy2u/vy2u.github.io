today I'm doing a first impression on it
the make up for ever ultra HD foundation
now I took the shade white and three one
five to match my neck and I'm super
excited about trying this because so
many issues have this foundation as
their favorite it's called the Ultra HD
foundation because it's meant to look
amazing in photos so I'm really excited
to see if it works for me with all first
impressions what I'm going to do is I
will do a photo test and I will also
come back in a few hours later tonight
and let you know how it went for me
throughout the whole day so what we're
gonna do now is boom this hip and as
always and we're gonna get straight into
trying the foundation this is the
packaging of the foundation I think that
it is absolutely gorgeous
The Vanishing does come up with a pump
which gives me a tumor sin thumbs over
with all foundations I pick them and
match them to my neck so it might look
slightly different to my face color so
that's because I fake tan so that's why
it looks a little bit different but it
will suit mine expertly
you
so straight away we can see that the
color match is pretty much spot-on it
suits my neck really really really well
I do feel like this foundation looks
kind of matte so drying my skin out a
little bit but that just could be
because I didn't use a primer today
the rest of my face then I'll get back
to you guys hey guys - the foundation is
now completely on my face so far I'm
absolutely loving the finish I think
that it looks it looks like my skin
which is like the biggest thing it's a
foundation which doesn't look like
foundation I feel like I started to
apply more and more and more thinking
that I need more coverage but the actual
thing is the foundation is meant to look
like your skin so it doesn't give you
like an ultimate full coverage however
as its oxidizing it is getting fuller
and fuller coverage on my face if that
makes any sense
however I am loving how natural it is
looking and and very pleaser that's so
far and I'm very happy with the car I'll
match mm-hmm
now I will read off the Box just let you
guys know more about this foundation and
what it's about or what kind of stuff
it's great for the very latest high
definition technologies of the film and
TV industry Ultra HD advanced formulas
look invisible on 4k camera and to the
naked eye perfect for the makeup froze
and for you that says it feels like a
second skin but still provides medium
coverage and the light diffusing formula
of natural and mexican looks flawless
and feel moisturized it is great for all
skin types and features a full range a
full range of shades to cover all of the
skin tones so that is something that I
can definitely agree with I feel like on
camera it is picking up quite well in
person it just looks like my skin it's
so hard to explain like it's a
foundation but it's such a natural
foundation it's not like oh my god
you're wearing flats the layers of
makeup kind of Foundation so what I'm
gonna do now is I'm going to film
another beer I'm filming a tutorial and
I'll be coming back to you in about five
or six hours to update you and how
fun now I'm going to do a photo test and
then I'll check in with you guys later
hi guys it's now 4 p.m. and I've had
this on since 9 so it is lasted very
well considering how long I've had it on
for the thing that I love the most about
foundation is it it has not creased
around my smile lines I always have like
the bigger problem ever foundations they
always create around my smile lines and
I use the NAS pressed powder in Beach on
the top of the foundation and it helps
just like keep everything together and
it's just really smoothed it out it did
give you a bit more coverage using a
powder foundation definitely is a medium
coverage it is not a full coverage so if
you are looking for something a little
bit more intense and having to hide
imperfections pimples whatever you may
need to use a lot of it or go to a
different foundation so my Holy Grail at
the moment is not sheer guy as running
you know but I'm gonna keep using this
because I feel like with foundations you
have to use them for a long time before
you actually realize like hey I like
this or hey I don't like this so I'll
keep using it and I'll see how I go but
for now I'm very happy with it I'm very
happy with how it's looked in my face I
do think as of right now like right this
moment I do prefer my nice sheer globe
that's just because that is like my
go-to foundation I keep using this for
about another week or so that I will
update you guys on my Twitter to let you
know how I found it after week but my
first versus first impressions that I'm
very very very pleased with it and I'm
definitely going to continue using it if
you are writing about this makeup look I
did do this makeup look on Tuesday so
it's my previous figure to this one so I
really hope you guys enjoyed this first
impression and then I gave you enough
detail about the foundations as well and
I'll see you guys really soon
I hope you have an amazing day fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
