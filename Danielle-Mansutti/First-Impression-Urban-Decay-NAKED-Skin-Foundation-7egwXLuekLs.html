start this first impression so I'm
really excited to try this because I
really love the Decay Naked skin
concealer so you see religiously as you
guys know my first impression of the
bottle and everything I'm really happy
that they kept the same kind of look as
the concealer so they work really well
together I'm hoping that this is my
shade I got sent this so I didn't color
match it to myself so here's to hoping
it does look like my shade and it's not
going to be like Dorito orange or
anything like that this is in the shade
4.0 so it looks like a glass bottle but
it sounds like it is plastic which is
great it's like a smash everywhere and
I'm ready to give this bad boy a go so
let's just get right into it it has a
pump on the top like this which is
always good
so what I wanna do is just put a little
bit o sort of running oh my god but
although I'm expecting that okay so it
is ridiculously runny it's like a liquid
yeah I think we're going to pump this
around to my face because look at that
it's like dripping everywhere I'm just
going to use my Beauty Blender and buff
this a little bit into my skin and then
see how we go I probably found liquid
it's like water
that's so weird it looks like skin it
doesn't look like foundation a little
bit more or a bit more coverage this is
so weird it looks so natural maybe
that's why it's called naked skin Dani
oh I'm very impressed with that
the shave looks pretty good as well I
also decided to not use a primer today
because I want to see how foundation
lost on its own without any help
this is crazy it looks like my skin do
you guys prefer putting foundation on
with your fingers would you prefer
putting it on your hand first or what
because I hate pre foundation away
and first because in my hand is just
full of makeup and I feel like I've
wasted so much for the product of you
know me you guys do it I love to know
leave it in the comments this is
definitely a low to medium coverage
foundation I'm so used to wearing the
Too Faced Born This Way Foundation at
the moment so this is looking like so
much nice coverage to me because that
foundation is like that amazing skin but
it is really nice so I do like the
finish because it's just so natural this
is like a perfect foundation like in
everyday use I feel like a work kind of
thing but I probably would not wear this
clubbing or to an event because I like
to wear stuff which is super
long-lasting but that kind of stuff
super high got rich so I'm assuming you
guys in real clothes I'm looking at my
Mac display over there so that I can see
myself so I can see that I'm focused if
I'm looking over here don't morning
here's the finish of the foundation I
feel like it did match my neck color
really well it is a lower coverage
foundation because as you can see you
can still see so my freckles and stuff
like that but all in all I feel like
this foundation is incredibly natural
and incredibly flattering for like an
everyday use now we're going to finish
doing my makeup and then I'm going to
come back to you guys and give you a
full view and about two hours from now
to see how it lasted till then and then
I'll come back in another few hours and
another few hours you guys know how this
works so I will see you later
how everyone does so I've just been
sitting here I've been filming for a
little while and now I've been editing
for a little while so yes my makeup
isn't looking that great I've eaten like
half my lipstick off let's just ignore
that I've had this on now or I put on at
8:30 it is now tooth it is sunk into my
lines a lot so let me zoom you in and
shows you look at this no foundation was
doing so well for itself and then it
just started getting a little bit dry on
my skin I do have normal skin so that is
quite mmm
not very that common for me I love the
finish of this foundation though because
it is very natural and it does look like
your skin so you can get away with
wearing it everyday and not look like
you're wearing makeup kind of things
just to give you more info about the
bottle itself it says it is a weightless
ultra definition liquid makeup and
unfortunately on the bottle itself there
is not much information at all is all on
the Box which everyone throws out we're
gonna have to read straight off the
website it says enriched with peptides
to restore elasticity and sodium high
I'll dive deeply this revolutionary
liquid foundation uses light diffusing
technology to create a radiant flawless
looking complexion
the light is our formula melts into the
skin to visibly blur the appearance of
fine lines coverage can be customized
built and concentrated on different
parts of the face desire for medium to
full coverage finish the foundation
comes packaged in a sleek no mess no
waste pop bottle and is available in 18
meticulously calibrated shades okay now
as you saw from my reaction I agree with
all that except the fine line part
because what's going on here it's so
annoying I really like the finish but
it's drying on my skin a bit strange why
do you do this to me so as of right now
I would write this foundation a 7 out of
10
it is only missing those last remarks
because of
that's not because I didn't use a primer
I don't use a primer a lot of the time
anyway and my Too Faced Born This Way
doesn't sink into my lines so I don't
know I am going to finish editing a few
videos and then I'll probably come back
about 6 p.m. tonight I'll let you know
how it lasted throughout the rest of the
day and my recommendation and my full
review or not and stuff like that hi
everyone it's been about three hours I
last checked in as we are winter now in
Australia it's going to get dark soon
I'm using natural lighting so what did
it feel miss never forget to hug I've
been wearing this foundation quite a
long time now for about eight or nine
hours and I am very impressed because
look it looks pretty good hasn't faded
or anything like that which is really
good I will zoom you guys in so you can
see closer on my skin you can still see
that I have got lines on my face you can
see it isn't patchy though that's what I
really like it's not been patchy at all
it's just sunk a lot so I've had to
quite a lot throughout the day get a big
fluffy brush and sort of blend that out
because it's not the nicest looking
thing ever so close and personal I love
the shade the shade matched me really
well and so that was the shade 4.0 in
this foundation I really liked it
definitely sticky with my 7 out of 10
and personally I would recommend this
foundation for people who are using it
for work or for school or for everyday
use and stuff like that however as you
saw on my photo tests it didn't have a
flashback yeah that is good so you can
wear clubbing if you prefer more of like
a medium coverage for that it was my
full review I hope you enjoy this first
impression I have not filmed a first
impression it's so long it's been so fun
to do this again if you have any
recommendations for things you'd like me
to review the
please let me know and I'll see you guys
very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
