give you bit of an update life updates
because for those of you that follow my
blog read my blog like red stuff which I
will leave link below it is Tony Martin
calm I did recently make a post kind of
opening up about what's going on here
recently and it was quite difficult to
write but talking about it's going to be
even harder so I'll be very vague I
guess but she's chosen apply I feel like
I haven't spoken to guys like me
directly to you by a camera in a long
time about you know life and stuff and
I'm getting a cat O'Shea which is very
exciting and all kind of linked into
what we're talking about today as well
something you don't really see on social
media very often as people openly
admitting that they're lonely or openly
admitting that they're really depressed
or just don't know everything has to be
a bit of a song and a dance online to
show that you're living a perfect life
when you're happy in your great and
incredibly exhausting to have to
constantly be keeping up that facade I
suppose there are times obviously when I
am super happy and everything is genuine
online but there's other times where I
stop and I think why are we at a point
in society where we just don't talk
about bad times anymore therefore when
people are going through bad times it's
a million tongue-tied for them because
they feel like they're the only place in
the world going through it it feels like
sometimes you're trapped in a cage with
this thing that is just trying to
absolutely take over your entire being
and make you stay in bed all the time
and pin you down and you can't escape
it's almost like you don't have the key
to the lock and it can be very difficult
to explain to someone that doesn't
experience depression to express what
you're actually going through and
over the last two weeks or so I've had
quite a bit of a bad patch and I have
spoken on Twitter mostly and it's been
lovely absolutely lovely to see how many
of you are just so nice and supportive
and writing the kindest word ever
towards me because it really does make a
huge difference to me when I read that
stuff and chasing flies silk there's
about two new people that are meeting
next week which is awesome and that's
something which I'm looking forward to
and I'm excited about and the little
anxious pol Anatomy is of course a bit
like oh my god you people but you just
got to like suck it up and enjoy it and
take it for what it is it's Sunday and I
haven't noticed anyone since Monday I
haven't actually hung out with a horse
it's Monday and so people that I am
friends with here busy this week and
it's making me realize that I need to
put myself out there and actually like
make friends strangers and I've tried
going to cafes or myself and stuff and
it is incredibly hard it's always such
an easy thing to do but it is very hard
and I always tell myself to just write
this way about and all these phases they
pass and they crash just like a ways and
you have your highest point during the
wave and after the crash is smooth
sailing and that is something which I'm
going to get inked onto my body today
because it's one thing I keep telling
myself it's one thing that always gets
me through these times but I think like
the first month is really groups of
going to the
some stars and like social things and
hopefully like there's some events
happening sooner I can go to politics
another massage photo just like this
stuff yeah
what I was out the quickest Heather of
my life that literally focused and I
mean I honestly that was about 20
seconds if it wouldn't be hope you can
hear me but I want to see think it was
about 20 seconds a minute goes it took
longer for us to the placement that I
did the actual tattoo but I'm bleeding a
little bit and I'll show you it once
it's all cleaned and everything but yeah
it's definitely a little bit bloody I'm
just going to grab some oh my god
I have an idea you guys haven't seen
flat in a little while so I thought I
would just give you a quick little
update on what's been added in so this
is my lounge slash workspace this is my
bail and these are her toys lying around
it's not super clean it's just like semi
clean this is sorry and that is but no
but oh my god I can't remember that
sorry it will but a cotton bar
but where I sit and I watch TBH i hate
my couch I got some eBay it doesn't
actually like these things like they
keep sliding apart and it's really
annoying
really cheap and I really really really
want a proper couch because I'm trying
to realize the importance of a good cat
my kitchen not changed that much I've
got two little welcome-home happy home
cards I've got my 100 K Plus bear themes
of cornets dead bins there doesn't know
one for myself but this is pretty much
air I spend a lot of my evenings and my
little workstation so got my million
subscriber plaque down there and try to
keep it nice and tidy I think a clean
desk gives you a clean mind and all that
no I just
that would commute but he has it plants
very cool it's real birth like real
plant so it's a little bit like bull
ever taste and then this mirror I love
it I got from next and then as we move
on we make it into my mother room and
such really consider my bedroom except
it's nice and bright which I love
oh my betta toys again Haney somebody
boys you need so this is my bed that's
where I spend probably 80 to 90 percent
of my time but what I love is the view
into the garden from my bed I don't know
the curtains look really weird but it
just brings in my line this way way I
love the view into the garden it's
really peaceful and you like it I think
that's about oh I just can't remember
this is my big expense recently this is
where I've been sitting filming so if
you can imagine it it's very difficult
trying to figure out how to film in
there so I've tried having the camera
standing upright looking into the mirror
and then I've had the camera on here but
I'd just make a wide angle lens
otherwise you wouldn't be able to see me
- close so I'm still trying to figure it
out but I do love this it cost me an
absolute fortune my lord but um I love
it and it's really cool and here it is
with the last one so long the front at
the moment I just got some basic things
that I use when I get ready and my
perfumes and yeah so makeup still
battery charger and like was in the
bottom hey beany when you did it
shouldn't the other room
so that bathroom doesn't probably look
quite different from when you saw it
last
except this whole cabinet changed
because relative to here before me like
look like they kicked their cabinets and
I was throwing holes in it so but that
changed which is nice
you know a little view into the garden
these bars can't creep me out a little
bit but I can't do anything about that
so we then go into the spare room which
is a work in progress still and here
obviously I'm just kissing like my extra
lights and everything like that he loves
going on this bed I just get a bed frame
for this bed fun fact about my bed so
one of my room and the one here of the
exact same because they are both Simba
mattresses and I am so obsessed with
some of mattresses it's not even funny
so this bed and let me just quickly
called school all this mud so Simba they
sent me this mattress first when I moved
in and it was just like a dream
literally it was so so so comfy that I
contacted them and I was like um I love
your bed so much can I please order a
second one and I go second one and I'm
obsessed if you remember me taking it
out of the box in my vlog when I moved
here which I'll give you a little
flashback all can't wait to see like how
long if it is a really concrete not yes
I did oh yeah I'm going to magically
turn this box into a bed oh my god I
just think it's mad how this came out of
a box and it's so comfy this is not
sponsored I'm so obsessed with these
beds not even funny if you need to find
a mattress you need to get on Simba I
literally have had like the best night
sleep and I'm not interested to say this
at all I just I can't recommend it
enough so my third is Simba as well and
Ben's up that you guys caught me a sunny
day we have got not much change to
really want to have like outdoor seating
area and I'd love to have like the
bunting and stuff on little summerhouse
right now it's like a chair and like
it's just really kind of like no he just
follows every everywhere like
pick Nene ask take that offer and second
okay okay so that is what is
looking like moment face wait I know
that it's not like decorated to a
standard that some lychee was decorating
their houses but remember I'm 22 this is
as much as I can afford seriously
I wish I could make go crazy with my
interiors but kind of don't have that
money in the bank I want to though this
is fine for me as simple as all the
necessities this I love this mirror and
that's pretty much it because I get to
know the time has come whoa my voice oh
my god ago the time has come to clean my
tattoo learn the word for you please
data okay time to wash the tag so there
it is but we came to my toes so for the
healing process should be fine I mean
the worst thing about this healing
process is that I kind of basswood
shrinks and that for me is like what
mm-hmm that really goes I'm like waxing
me in a pot on my elbow
okay that hurts more than the tattoo
okay so dressing is off there's a bit of
blood around so I'm just going to wash
my tattoos so don't have any like the
pants and everything unfortunately I
might go and get some tomorrow but I
think considering its size like
certainly think I need a whole chew and
then for it which is the cream that you
put on your heads as the healing okay
I'm now washed baby I'm pretty sure it
with a normal tell you can get the fuzzy
stuff in you old tabby which sounds
quite horrendous they gonna stab it to
Roy and here it is my little way
so I am very happy with my little ways I
absolutely a lot of them that you will
hear very fresh
wait maybe that's better if you go to
see but super fresh and and just happy
like it's going to make me think when I
do go through these times to to know
that things get better and I know it
might be the most cliche tattoo to some
people but it means a lot to me and it's
something which I constantly tell myself
and I'm going through a tough time like
I am recently and I'm very happy with it
I hope you guys like it too and I will
show you one more time before I log off
so now I have three I promise
oneness and one there so thank you guys
so much for watching my life updates
video today and I will see you all very
soon there's a fly that is attacking my
camera right now but I'll see you all
very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
