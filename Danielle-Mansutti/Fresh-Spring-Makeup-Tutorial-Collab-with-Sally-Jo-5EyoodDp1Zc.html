their really exciting video because as
you can tell from the title this is a
collaboration with the gorgeous
Sally jello I have done a spring fresh
pretty girly wearable look and Sally has
done a full look for the different
hemispheres because it Australia we have
just hit Springs no it's nice and warm
again I'm so happy so I'll leave some of
Sally's Clips here just so you can get
to know her better and please check out
her video as well and the theme of this
collaboration is spring and fall but
also we're using makeup geek eyeshadows
so I've achieved this look with makeup
geek eyeshadows and sally has achieved
this look with makeup the eye shadow
it's very simple it's very basic and
it's very girly I really hope that you
enjoy it and let's jump straight into it
and it's lovely headband time I'm gonna
start with the steel at one step of
correct form eye primer and then I'm
everyone to be a covergirl outlast
today fabulous foundation in golden 10
yes this looks so dark army but it does
match my Terran now I'm using a deep
dark brunette fluid line by Mac and I'm
using this on my brows to make them
appear nice and thick because as you can
see they're not naturally nice and thick
so I've got a compromise and use this
amazing product that I've fallen in love
with
now using Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer and just popping this
underneath my eyes letting it out with
my Beauty Blender and then also using
the bottom of my beer under to tap it in
and buff it around my face this is an
awesome set for the spring makeup look
as it makes you look a lot more fresh
and awake now I mean we're able to stay
matte from my powder just popping this
over my concealer and my foundation just
to make sure that it is set for the
whole day for eyeshadow I'm using creme
brulee from makeup geek in my crease and
using this as my transition shade
starting with the little windscreen
wiper motions as always back and forth
back and forth and a little bit more
back and forth and I'm using one's
gorgeous shake of a whimsical and I'm
packing this all over my lid and just
stopping at the very very very top of my
lid where it meets the creme brulee
shade and I'm using a flat brush to
apply this now this shade is amazing
this is grandstand from makeup geek and
I'm using this in the outer corner of my
eye just to darken it up so I'm popping
it in my crease and then blending it
towards the middle of my eye where we
make the light shade
burnt backing with whimsical I'm using
this as my eyebrow highlight oh my god I
have fallen involved with roller lash
from benefit it is amazing you know I
haven't found it sooner dis apply this
to my talking bottom lashes I decided to
stay away from falsies today so yo
using the next milk jumbo pencil I
believe it's called Oh anyway just put
it in my water line and all obsessed
Matt go deposit
you need to get it is so nice so I'm
just popping this on my cheeks and then
blending it up to my forehead as well
I'm not doing any contouring so just
bronzer and blush I'm using the NYX
blush in for play on my cheeks so lip
liner I'm using saw which is also
amazing I've found a lot of new products
lately which I'm just obsessed with I'm
putting salt on my lips and just
aligning them to get them ready for the
lipstick and I'm using this lipstick
called modesty by Mac it is very similar
to that it's heady but it's more pink
enveloped Eddy's warp around and oh I
love it
perfect for this look all right now this
is the first time I ever use this spray
so get ready for my face so thank you
guys so much for watching all way to the
end I love you for that please check out
Sally's video as well and check out her
full look and please leave any comments
