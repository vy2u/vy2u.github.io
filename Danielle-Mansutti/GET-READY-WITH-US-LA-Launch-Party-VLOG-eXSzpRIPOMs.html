to do this is not where's that thanks so
much
ecology from and I always wanna go to it
Red Bull so you put a red huh yeah I'm
actually trying to frame and go for the
red I'm gonna do a pink
I'm going on oh no such a very method is
kill I like time never has Rama for me
well but when I saw it in the stand
along River and I'm using anastasiya
shadows by the way we heat up waking up
let me go up another question if you can
only take one make up product with you
on a trip what would you teach brothel
oh we can see one oh hi I'm open about
well I'll be honest I can't wear any
yeah I will take the back knee never Art
and Design really yeah I feel like I
will have to take that you're not trying
to go out the house keep jumping I'm
that way is mascara
oh sorry we lost a minute Boy oh yeah we
have some relation yeah sorry so awards
the way to scar like a dirty Catherine
should not leave the house without is
there anything that I asked you like I'm
not boring so I can I have roller lash
or bit of a six are going to one thing
to see green turns to the left of the
filaments like Bowl since like what Oh
what were your first impressions of each
other I don't think it's difficult Ella
first the pressures when you see to an
online I think you were more like you're
cooking this aura well but more like
talk tips and I saw you movie because I
knew that you were shy so I seem to be
really shy really but I was like oh no
she's like she's cool I was living for
you were going to be like because I'm
not going to talk into that ocean we're
talking
hey guys hey how are you imagine we
would being like very shallow walk with
a like no nothing is normal I am NOT I'm
not great at all me but I feel like I
don't know but if we clicked quite
quickly
I think my first verses depression which
is weird because I want it so like you
have seen in which is the weasel yapping
I didn't recognize you because I was
looking for girls pink hair literally I
starts looking around but that was like
before I knew about Tyler and Half Moon
wings yeah and many others do do you see
her anywhere the girls a bit more just
muscle it one with drink and when we met
as well I was a little bit was not like
scared but I was thinking you know
because we met online and through
Charley like praising my lashes and
stuff I was just thinking I hope that
like we get on as friends and we're not
just sit down to what YouTube again yeah
that's what I really don't like I don't
like the conversation all that me and
stuff and because I might Talia through
what I do I was a little bit like
rewarded hope it's not going to be like
I'm really actions about my return sense
but then when I saw she had a black wig
on with a cap and she just had been like
chased around by people thinking into
Kylie Jenner I was blown away actually
when I first met you about our confident
you were really oh my god no way I was
because I didn't expect it literally the
moment I saw you it was like it wasn't
like the first time you met you like oh
hey oh my god this would happen yellow
that it wasn't like awkwardly like hi
I'm telling ya oh yeah I just like
straight into it and then I was like oh
okay and they're like we're just like
the last thing about that and then I
took tired because I asked everyone
before I what what what am i select any
comfortable size for me
yeah throw the cover in the face and the
key National Journal and it was just
natural yeah which is nice when I kind
of was a bit relieved because being in
LA as well I didn't really have like
English outlets with someone that kind
of understood my humor yeah and then
when I came across Talia I realized
because as you guys know I couldn't
really find many people in Australia
that could quite understand my humor
either but I found that we kind of just
like clicked with what we found some
English if you could speak honestly like
blue thumbs up but probably laughs up
like we've watered up as a lot of 10
minutes we were loving it nothing
glittering and then we were even saying
the other day that it's weird because
the first time that we met we didn't
cook as well as the second time second
times we like it happened what it is
falling in French in dollars too because
it's weird because that second time and
you can see it on camera as well yeah
that second time wasn't supposed to
happen it just is like a random thing
that we organised last millennia but we
had completely different plans like by
noticing an assassin like with another
youtuber too and then last minute we
were kind of like stranded in earth cafe
which winter today were to do it yeah
because the rain was so bad and we have
to talk to sure that like two hours
straight and we just which is quick yeah
and there's no like yeah that's I
remember that time to that like a second
aggression all that way it feels like
really weirdly natural yeah no awkward
pauses like well going home I know and
my whole life like every every person
but most people come across that had to
feel like I have to be the different
around them just do like accepted but I
was just being a bit of a dick and being
back with me and I was like oh okay like
you guys know that I hate when people
think that if you're forward you're more
important and other people will like
whatever I think everyone's saying that
much in hang out and vehicle and that's
why and I think if people put me on a
pedestal and act as if like I'm a really
important I think I'm like I'm really
not like just draw me like I'm normal
like you and
you did that which is noise because if
someone's often by five any questions
about me and acting like I'm very
important I'm just like yeah it's really
not enough ISM getting to be that love
because I before major situation so when
I decide she's Maya before racial back
the lashes are odd love these one so
much letter and glam literally I'm
getting this look is I do
Oh Sheriff is literally what is each
other's worst habit okay I thought how
every single other litigants astrology
about the fact that you don't see like
little is positive in yourself like you
see yourself so differently to how you
actually are in a negative way you see
yourself so negatively and that's about
heaven because which Almighty other day
like one day I hope I'll have the
confidence that I pretend know how you
see yourself
this is so bad confetti okey one I'm
gonna go bring a dress slay me I say to
intrude Oh
literally amount of time cuz how I
always choose this draws and every
single time we get drink sugar these
tumors are so honking hello
and she which would shoot the whole
thing so it's impossible to drink out of
it I like is it everyone is like Talia

actually a horrible person is quite a
bad thing freshly washed and truthy Dame
