in today's view I'm sharing a really
really really easy and effective summer
makeup tutorial along with how to do
beachy waves in literally like five
minutes and I'm not even kidding I'm
gonna show you a really cool hack so
make sure to stick around to the end for
that and the makeup that I'm going to
show you is so versatile but it's like a
summer party a picnic it can just be
like an everyday makeup look it's
amazing and I want to give a massive
thank you and all my love to Revlon for
partnering with me on this video today
I'm gonna show you a few of my favorite
things from Revlon Before we jump into
it I would love to ask you from me to
you if you're not already subscribed to
my videos you will see those have been
red button to subscribe down below but
unfortunately YouTube is making it
pretty hard for us crews a minute
because even if you are subscribed to us
our videos won't always pop in your sub
box so if you could hit the little Bowl
and then comment down below letting me
know that you hit about I would really
really appreciate that
and without further ado let's get into
it and Here I am with makeup on my hair
it's freshly washed ready for the
styling in a minute so first of all I'm
gonna prime it using the a Revlon
or reducing primer and then we're gonna
follow it up with the Revlon Colorstay
foundation and this one is in the shade
three 3-0
I've literally fallen so in love with
this foundation matches to my turn like
it's a no but this is you see how I just
look like I have a really nice clear
skin love it so I'm gonna run onto my
brows now fill them in a much you can do
my eye portion first because we're gonna
be doing eyeliner I like to do Allen and
before powder and stuff just in case is
any mistakes its way easy to clean up
with just foundation I'm gonna use the
brow fantasy by Revlon and this one is
in a really really dark brown shade what
I love about it is that this side is the
pencil as you see and then the other
side is like the gel so it's like a
two-in-one it makes life so much easier
it's insane it's also waterproof which
for summer is like I deal alright so
let's start doing this and I might Suman
for you guys in a sec so you can see
exactly how to do it but the angled tip
makes it so easy to make it precise as
well and make it look more like hairs
and then I find with the gel it just
helps to like brush it and tame it's
like a sculpted brow so let me zoom you
in see you say exactly what's going on
and as you can see this brow is now
filled in with a pencil and this brow is
not the with the pencil I like to kind
of start at my arch and just do really
light strokes because this pencil is
super precise anyway and then I'm just
gonna follow my natural shape and change
the pressure as I go so what everybody's
feel anymore I'll just press a little
bit harder and then when I get to the
front when it goes super super super
light and now I'm just taking the gel
side to set everything in place and also
sculpt my brows alright so now that the
brows are down we're gonna move on to
the eyes and the Browns have a 24-hour
wear formula and so it does what I'm
about to put on my eyes as well this is
the Revlon Colorstay cream eye shadow
this one is in praline and what I love
about it is that it actually comes with
a brush in the eyeshadow you don't have
to be like lugging around too much you
can let you just do it with this brush
so I'm gonna pop this on my eyes because
it's like a really nice glowy summery
color I was gonna dip the
it's like really mess free which is
perfect and this is waterproof - just
like the brows so it's gonna be fab for
like summer holidays I'm also gonna add
a tiny bit of the Revlon Photoready
insta-fix highlighting stick to my eyes
as well just really a bit more shimmer a
little bit and now for the absolutely
star of the show this is the Revlon
exacta fire eyeliner it is so cool I'm
gonna show you guys the applicator but
first I am just gonna give it a little
bit of a shake shake it like a yeah all
right what I love about this it has a
wheel tip applicator is that not the
coolest thing ever
it's when you actually put it onto your
eye and I'm gonna do like a bold look
first I'm gonna bold on afterwards
you'll see how easy is to piranha with
this baby so after we shake this bad boy
we're gonna hold it our eye and then
roll the eyeliner on we're gonna roll it
down like a very thin bold line first
now we're left with a nice clean
straight line and then I'm gonna go in
and hold my eye and roll the eyeliner
into a wing following the bottom it's
basically use this as a template so the
way this goes up I'll follow this
upwards as well
this is a very thin little wing but I
want to go folder so grab the eyeliner
and we are gonna start from here and do
one continuous roll just like that I'm
gonna go a little bit thicker so again
one big roll and now you can see we are
left with this beautiful bold eyeliner
and it is so easy to apply it hey let's
just roll it on its glides and same goes
for this side as well like it is just
sharp I have tried and tested this
mascara and it is really really good and
also comes off with just warm water
which is a game-changer because you guys
know how frustrating is you can't get
mascara off but this is like flake free
and smudge proof yet comes off it's
really good for like plumping and
extending your lashes if that's what
you're looking for I mean that's right
down my street I'm like oh yeah it
literally gets right in there
in that line and I will zoom you guys in
for my other eye so you see exactly what
I mean
Revlon always do good mascara is and I
think it's really like underrated I
remember one of my first mascara ever
was from Revlon I swear it at school
over time and it was just like the best
thing ever that was back when I used to
like blue mascara as well how times have
changed
let's get these fibers working to plump
up these eyelashes so you see how you
can still see a little bit here on my
lash line that is literally gonna
disappear in just a second with this
mascara like I love her gets right in
there so I like to kind of wiggle wiggle
my wand sounds like we're getting weird
Harry Potter reference I would not
recommend putting on mascara just by
blinking and going up I actually blink
and wiggle and I find you get the most
out of it for sure
now that our eyes looking great we are
gonna do the rest of the face I'll run
through it super quickly for you guys as
well I'm gonna be taking the fill and
blur concealer this one is in
too late peel some of these little
sponge applicators that you press and it
will come through and then for lender my
beauty blender you can also use this to
pick us up any issues with the eyeliner
so you have any bits to be wing that I
like completely flying away you can
always that kind of tame it with the
concealer with just like a flat brush as
well and then now just grab your
favorite bronzer and we're gonna bronze
ourselves up with summer we want to look
nice noise and brown for sure then I'm
taking the amazing highlighting stick
again yeah you want to make sure to
blend them and okay so if Harry's out
just before we style it I'm gonna put on
some lipstick this nude is unreal like
is the nicest nude ever and this one is
in zero for pair so there's no killing
time and I've got the best hack ever I
like to make your hair curled in
ritually and no time are we taking at my
ghd's these are GHD platinum and you
want to do is just put your hand to or
having your part your hair if it's on
the side and then we're gonna look it's
a really buddy and we're gonna tie it
into a side ponytail or a bunch and then
it looks fabulous I feel like I'm in the
Spice Girls right now but if you
honestly saves so much time
I find that we're calling it this way
you get every single bit of hair so I
find that just curling your hair when
it's day
you missed the back of your head all the
time so I'm gonna be taking my straight
up put myself in the oh I'm taking my
straight news and what I'm gonna do is
angle it this way and then twist and
then I'm gonna pull down like this I
broke my hair with a straightener over a
curling one these days just because I
find with a curly one that can just look
like obviously like tight curls are all
identical but I just want a hair
straightening your curls just look like
unique they don't look like too uniform
and to kind of like tight they just look
really loose and effortless and natural
so like I love straightness for example
so now that is all cold I'm just gonna
give it a bit of a school lunch as well
so I got two apps in there total and you
can see that this is like perfectly coat
this side straight and when we take out
honey like entire head so now once the
other side is done you'll have these
like really loose bouncy waves you can
use hairspray or like sea salt spray or
anything you want just do a little
spritz in your hair and then scrunch
scrunch inge is like the most important
thing to build a bit of body in this
hairstyle because it can go a little bit
flat sometimes so I just like to school
brunch as much as possible to give me a
whole Advani and then all these little
like flyaways
we're just gonna tell you in person and
then now we are left with this finished
look we've got some bold eyeliner we've
got glowy skin we've got nude lips this
could be an everyday makeup look or a
summer party look very easily let me
know down below if you do decide to
recreate this makeup look or this
hairstyle I would love to see it on
Instagram to tag me on the photo so I
could find you and until next time guys
