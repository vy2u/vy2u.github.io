today I'm doing a get ready with me I've
always wanted to use that blue berry
blue color whatever it's called from the
semi-sweet palette so I sort of made
this look around that whole color and
I'm also showing you how I get this high
ponytail with extensions it's so easy
guys you're gonna love it it's so easy
you know that I've done this no time
center tutorials before but I thought I
would actually show you in the get ready
because I'm heading out so I thought I
made I'll show you how I do it it's such
an easy thing to do and it's perfect if
you have short hair long hair no
thickness or whatever so I'm gonna get
straight into this tutorial I hope you
guys enjoy it and a let's get straight
into it to the first color I'm gonna use
say is pink sugar and I'm gonna put this
on it a luxe to take crease brush from
zoeva and I'm just gonna place this on
the inner corner just for a little bit
of sparkle and this will just lighten up
the blue wants me apply as well so I'm
only gonna apply it on the inner corner
it has hardly any pigmentation as well
so it's just a little glittery glittery
color we're gonna get luck smoky eye
shader brush by zoeva I'm going to dip
it into a blueberry swirl and I've been
dying to try out this color so long so I
sort of made this whole look around the
blueberry collar so what we're gonna do
once you have it packed onto your brush
is place it in the middle but stop
around here so we're gonna pack it on
the lid but then stop here because we're
gonna darken the outside
now I'm taking the color hot fudge and
the aim is to put this in our crease and
also in the outer corner of the eye so
imagine if we didn't blend our eyeshadow
and it look like this in the end it's
pretty horrifying so now I'm going to
take the color peanut butter and I'm
going to try and blend out the harsh
lines around the dark hot fudge color
we're just going to apply this above the
hot fudge color and sort of attempt to
blend them together this may take a
little while though because blacks are
always the worst things in the world to
blend out
now I'm taking a big fat concealer brush
like this one and I'm using it in the
color coconut cream I'm going to use
this as my eyebrow highlight and this is
also going to help clean up all the
yucky mess we've made with the peanut
butter color so now the coconut cream is
packed on I'm just going to take peanut
butter once again and blend it into
coconut cream and we will host quite a
lot of the blue color so I'm just gonna
go over that once again and I'm just
gonna darken up the outside of the eye
once again
so I'm using pink sugar and I'm just
going to add a bit add a bit of glue it
up to the look so I'm just going to make
sure it is so not pigmented so it's only
good for like glittery stuff like this
and now it's time to get some eyelashes
going on I'm using the Too Faced better
than sex mascara as always how original
so I'm just going to put on the mascara
and then I'll put on some false lashes
straight after just so you know the
false eyelashes that I use are from shop
miss a I know you buy them on bulk
because they're $1.00 on there and I
love them so much so that's where
they're wrong I think they're cool
Cara eyelashes is mka but I'm not too
sure and if you watch all my videos you
know that I leave my under eye part
until after I do my concealer and stuff
so I am gonna be doing a little bit more
eye shadow stuff to my bottom lashes but
just not yet now I'm going to attempt to
get these lashes on in one go on camera
so wish me luck
so now there's a little bit of mess
underneath my eye I'm gonna take my
naked skin
weightless complete coverage concealer
in the shade light warm and I'm going to
use this just to clean up any mess and
also just to highlight underneath the
eyes to give it a nice effect and I'm
going to use my beauty blender to blend
this out okay you guys also let me know
in the comments to you guys honestly I
do you prefer voiceover things do you
prefer when I talk when I chat through
it or be prefer videos where it's just
like a sped up process at the make up
because I've tried to do a lot of
different styles of tutorials lately and
I just like to know if you could let me
know in the comments right now which
one's your favorite like to refer chatty
ones or do you prefer voiceovers or just
visual so no talking just me applying to
makeup and you just sort of figuring out
what I'm doing kind of thing because I
love to hear what you guys that you like
and stuff because that would help me up
a lot so now that it's all cleaned up
I'm just gonna put on some eyeliner in
my waterline as I've done on this eye
I'm using the Rimmel exaggerate
waterproof eyeliner I guess who knows is
start meeting likewise I'm I don't know
what it actually is
anyway I'm just going to amend it and
the camera thing actually this is
dangerous because I just copy bother
getting my mirror um
just line your waterline very thinly
and now we're just going to put mascara
on our bottom lashes this is something
that some people like really don't like
but I love doing it so I always do it a
little bit of mascara on my bottom
lashes but I don't want to go overboard
make them like spice so I think just a
little coat of mascara looks so much
better
it's turning personal opinion but I
really think that it really makes a
difference how many times can I see
really in one sentence I think I need to
expand my vocabulary a little bit and
just a tip because I just noticed I
asked to my glorious mascara right there
on my eye if that ever happens to you
guys do not wipe it straight away you've
got to wait maybe two minutes until it's
dry and then just get a q-tip and wipe
that a little cheeky thing off your face
so I'm gonna use my luxy hair extensions
today and I'm actually doing a giveaway
for you guys so if you allow someone 20
or 24 inch luck sees they'll be
following myself and luxy hair on
Instagram and YouTube your friends for
extra entries and get 5 bonus entries by

the winner and shipping the prize so
I'll leave all the info for that in the
description and I wish you guys the best
of luck so right now we're moving on to
the hair part I thought I would include
this because I did this sort of pile a
lot in my videos but never least shown
you how I do it with my hair extensions
so my natural hair with a ponytail is a
base length yeah so first just grab a
hair tie like that and with your hair
just a few inches down around here just
tie it in a I guess like a second fence
up and you want to leave about this much
of room between the two hair ties it's
now just grabbing my hair extension it
is a little bit lighter than my hand but
it gives a cool little ombre effect so
that's why I picked a lighter color and
this one is a full clip piece like that
now what I'm going to do is at the very
part of this second pair time is I'm
going to start clipping in the hair
extensions around the actual hair tie
itself and now you'll see that there is
obviously like a band around the top and
airing of the first part in so you're
gonna want to grab another wet now girl
you're getting it another way and this
is another four clip piece and I'm just
going to brush so now for this part
you're going to want to put it in the
middle of that section so now we have
one on the end section and now we're
going to put one in the middle now you
can see obviously that there is the weft
there and you can see some of the clips
and all that kind of stuff and just make
sure you have some bobby pins or
something and what we're going to do is
we're going to wrap this around where
the weft is to hide the extensions so
you're gonna wrap it around your head
like this until there's no Clips visible
or anything like that so now that we
have this cute little two hair thing up
peanut one's gonna pull it down a little
bit just secure it in place with some
bobby pins and seriously that's all
there is to it and now we have a much
longer pickup ponytail so easy to do and
I love it I've only used two weft of the
luxy hair extensions so you don't have
to use too much I'm just used however
many is thick enough for your hair but
do remember that if you use a lot of
works it will be really heavy and really
painful on your hair so as always thank
you guys so much for watching today it
means be well to me don't forget to
check out the little giveaway that we
are doing I'll link all the stuff in the
description if you missed it throughout
the video and that's pretty much it I
hope you guys have an amazing week and
I'll see you really soon
I'm here with this boy this is Michael
and he's my boyfriend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
