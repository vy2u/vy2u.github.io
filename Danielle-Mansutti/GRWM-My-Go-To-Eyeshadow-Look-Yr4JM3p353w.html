in today's video I filmed my eye shadow
looks because I am getting ready to cut
clubbing tonight I wanna start shadow
look recently in a lot of vlogs like
from New York and LA you guys are like
where's the tutorial oh so here it is I
hope you guys enjoy let's dive into it
we are starting off today with the Mac
soft ochre Pro Longwear Paint Pot I'm
just going to put this over my entire
eyelids to make sure that we have a nice
face ready for all the color for our
transition show today we are using
blazing by Anastasia Beverly Hills I am
placing this in my crease and then I am
continuously burning it out it shaded
actually kinda know how to blend so as
you can see I was blending and blending
doing just a little more blending on top
of that as well then I moved on to fudge
by Anastasia Beverly Hills and I just
packed this all over my lid with a flat
brush
and then blending that through with a
clean fluffy brush this gorgeous gold
eyeshadow is from our cosmetics I love
it so much lookout pigmented it is so
I'm backing this all over my lid with my
finger because I feel I get the best
color payoff that way and then I'm using
corrupt by makeup geek and I'm putting
this on the outer corner of my eye so
just in the last third of my eye and
sort of winging it out a little bit and
then I'm going to blend it all together
and then I'm packing on that gold shade
once again to all the places where it's
sort of being blended away and then
check to see how to look after I have
cleaned it up I'm using the lorac Pro
contour palette and I'm using the
highlight shade just to put that
underneath my brow bone and also clean
up any of the transition shade which
went up too far
then using the NARS creamy concealer in
custard I'm placing this underneath my
eyes and I'm starting with a flat
concealer brush first to sort of map out
the wing that I want to create and clean
this up with so I like to do this first
and then I go with my Beauty Blender
afterwards and just blend all the
concealer into my skin
using fudge once again I'm now placing
this on my lower lash line with a pencil
brush and I'm only gonna go about half
way because I don't to be too dramatic
this is sort of like a semi dramatical
look I guess and then I'm putting that
gold shade on the inner corner of my eye
following this I'm using the eye of
Horace black eyeliner
now I like to use roller lash by benefit
and the Too Faced better than sex
mascara together for different reasons I
use roller lash to sort of separate my
lashes and make them super long and then
I like to go in with the better than sex
mascara to add a lot of volume because
that mascara is like oh it's so good it
makes your lashes so big it's amazing I
mean look at that difference
oh my god anyway moving on to falsies
we're using the ice by lashes in Luna
these are my ultimate lashes I love them
so much and they make my eyes look kind
of almond shape and like a little cat
eye and I love it love it love it love
it and that concludes the tutorial for
my go-to eyeshadow look I hope you guys
really enjoy this and I'll see you all
very soon in my next video why</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
