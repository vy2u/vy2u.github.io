today I created sort of like a very
spontaneous smokey sunset si that makes
any sense this is a get ready with me
because I am heading out right now so
what you guys would like to see it in
and that's it guys I really hope that
you enjoy this today so we are starting
off with my little skincare routine that
I've got going on at the moment so I've
been using skin ink and it just helps me
to achieve that perfect skin and before
you master your perfect makeup look and
I have been loving the skin ink
optimizer voyage and get awesome kit so
I got my hands on this throat lock
solocom and they've got like 220 brands
on there they've got free shipping to
Australia I think it's four orders above
$40 free shipping to New Zealand above
$60 so I'm going to add one drop of each
serum and massage it onto my cleansed
skin
and this is a sleeping gel mask that
hydrates and boosts cell renewal in one
step so let me introduce you guys to the
skinning optimizer void set so it looks
pretty funky but basically the optimizer
voyage it uses LED chromotherapy and
low-frequency current stimulation to
wake up your skin cells basically it
just helps to enhance the absorption of
active ingredients in your skincare
products
so here's a big close up of using it on
my skin and my favorite thing about this
is its size it's so compact and cute so
if everything in the description below
for their details and to follow them and
all that kind of stuff just so you guys
know I do have a discount code for lock
solar it is BLX immense sweetie at the
checkout and you can get 25% off which
is awesome all the products that I'm
using in this tutorial today are from
luck solar so I'm going to be starting
with my gorgeous Beauty Blender which I
am in love with just to apply my
foundation
and now I'm using one of the sleek
palettes I have fallen in love with this
I'm not going to do too much of a
voiceover now I just so you guys can
watch and learn I just feel like talking
through this might just ruin it so I'm
just gonna let you guys watch my little
get ready with me
so thank you guys so much for watching
today I really hope that you love the
look it was very spontaneous and I
really didn't have any clue of what the
look would turn out like but I think
it's nice it's very colorful and bronzy
just yeah it's different so I hope you
guys have a great week and always seeing
you really soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
