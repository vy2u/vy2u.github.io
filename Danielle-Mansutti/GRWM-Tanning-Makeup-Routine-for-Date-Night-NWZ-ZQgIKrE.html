today's video I'm showing you how I get
ready for a date night in one hour so
I'm going to show you these steps like
my turn and then we're moving on to this
gorgeous shimmery bronze II and makeup
look as well so as you guys know I love
ain't anything you pretty much never see
me without it you guys know that I have
my favorites right go and have some fun
and have a hot 10 fling with the Rimmel
Sun shimmer so I'm going to show you how
I apply that in today's video with my
tips and tricks and all that kind of
stuff as well so Ramon I have partnered
up to express the word about some
shimmer in this video is still one of my
favorites I absolutely love it for a lot
of reasons the first of all it's
affordable it has a really natural color
as you can see for me today it develops
in only an hour it doesn't stain your
sheets and it lasts longer as well so
it's a great little turn if you go to
Fitness first or anything like that I've
seen some people Twitter better being on
Spotify you may have seen the hilarious
add that Rimmel and I filmed for its
spring it's time to have a hot turn
fling with room if you have seen that
let me know in the comments will be
awesome to find out how many of you have
already seen that ad that we made so the
talent I'm showing you today is the dark
a matte color you're in Australia in get
in place like Priceline pharmacy chemist
warehouse Target Kmart Big W and then
also like selected Kohl's Woolworths and
various pharmaceutical literally get it
anyway it's just a for job over to
showing you how I applied my tear my
before and after it all the in between
most important thing you have to do is
exfoliate please make sure that you get
some kind of exfoliating mitt or an
exfoliating cream or something and
explore your body before you start
because it'll give you the best possible
base for the tan there's some times that
I've been too lazy to my or cocobolo
explain whatever and I can't really
scaly scaly scaly tan so try and avoid
those as much as you guys can so here is
how I do my 10 and I'm going to show you
as well this makeup look so please keep
watching so here is my a little before
and yes I am very pale so I'm using the
Rimmel Sun shimmer mousse mine is in the
shade dark matte it does come in three
shades but dark matte is my favorite so
putting on my pink Rimmel tanning glove
to start with then I apply three pound
so my neck and my chest I'm going to
start applying this in sort of circular
motions and blending it all in and it
has such a natural bronze color it's
gorgeous
it dries within two minutes as well
which is so good as you can see I am
picking up the pace and making sure it's
all blended and I grab a brush like this
just any fluffy brush and I use this to
blend it in that's my little tip and
trick of the day guys if you want a
perfect tan and what's really great as
well as it doesn't have a fake tan smell
thank the Lord
so this lasts really long was tan lasts
up to seven days it is streak free as an
even finish and it has an oil enhance
formula which does not dry out your skin
which is amazing and as you may have
heard me say at the start it does not
stain your sheets
thank God less washing amazing I love it
so I'm just applying it onto my hands
like this I choose my brush to apply tan
on to my hands that way you don't get
the really gross fake tan hands and you
can already see the massive difference
between that fresh coat and my other
white arm here's how the town looks
immediately after drying it does develop
in one hour and because it does dry
within two minutes I can pop on my top
and start to get ready
and now moving on to a makeup I'm using
me a nice sheer glow foundation in
Barcelona and quickly just applying this
all over the face this matches the tone
really well as well and agrees my
Anasazi belly hills dipbrow to fill in
my brows which you guys have seen five
hundred million times so I'm just
speeding through it very very very
quickly and then as always I'm grabbing
at some concealer as well and cleaning
up the brow as I go because I could
never do it perfect on the first try
then using the Rimmel wake me up
concealer I'm just applying a little bit
on to my eyelids blending it out and
then applying the Rimmel stay matte
powder over the top
it's just finish early we have a really
good base ready for the eyeshadow
application and for my eyeshadow today
I'm using this gorgeous Tarte palette
which is called the rainforest of the
sea palette I'm going to start with this
little brown matte shade here and apply
it onto my lid in my crease as a
transition shade it's a really warm
glowing shade perfect for this look and
then I'm moving on to this really
coppery bronzy color I'm just going to
pack that over my entire lid now with
this shimmery golden color
I'm just going to apply it in my inner
corners and also drag it a little bit
into the middle of my lid as well now
I'm using the Rimmel scandaleyes
reloaded mascara I'm just applying this
on to my top lashes before applying a
falsies now the grand reveal these are
the eyes by sweet or lashes these are
going to be released on a Monday on
Danny bTW calm these are a perfect
mixture between flirtin and Mara I
absolutely love them and can't wait to
release them I'll leave all the info
about them in the downbar I am obsessed
with these stars we have four new styles
coming out on Monday I'm so excited and
then with the Rimmel wake me up
concealer once again I'm going to apply
this underneath my eyes to clean up with
the eye shadow that we just made
so i'm following my lower lash line
upwards as you can see and I'm just
making a really nice crisp strong line
and then I'm just going to blend it out
with my Beauty Blender and apply the
Rimmel stay matte powder over my entire
face to make sure that it is all matte
and nice and covered and beautiful I
love this powder I've used it for years
now and honestly best drugstore powder
of
all time now using the Bahama Mama
bronzer I'm going to quickly use this to
contour and bronze my cheeks I'm just
using this one product today just to
make it a little bit easier and this is
a very bronzy look so I thought I would
go a little little bit overboard so I'm
using the Anastasia Beverly Hills aglow
kit I'm using this gold bronze color on
my cheekbones am that highlight the ho
so good and then of course putting it
down my nose and all that good stuff
grabbing that copper shade again I'm now
putting this on my lower lash line and
then after I do that I'm going to apply
some mascara as well to my bottom lashes
now I'm using this gorgeous Kate
lipstick it's in the shade 55 all the
products are in the downbar if you do
need to check them out and here is how
the makeup look turned out I really hope
you guys enjoyed it
