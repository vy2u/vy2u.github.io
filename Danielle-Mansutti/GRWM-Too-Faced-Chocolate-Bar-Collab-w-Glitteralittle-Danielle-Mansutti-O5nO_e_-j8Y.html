today is a collaboration with my good
friend Chloe on YouTube
we've decided to collaborate and use the
toothpaste palette so I used to talk
about palette and she used the
semi-sweet palette and I have come up
with a sort of golden es sparkly jewy
summary girly glittery you look I really
hope that you guys enjoy it so the first
part is a voiceover because I was doing
my eyes and I was concentrating so like
oh I can't talk but the rest is me just
going like bah bah bah so I hope that
you guys enjoy it please let me know if
you do and let's get straight into it
using the Tweety fabulous and flawless
foundation in the shade ate my face and
I'm using the real techniques sponge to
apply this so I don't know if you can
see or not but someone's been breaking
me out quite a lot recently so
definitely gonna have to go and cover
this up ASAP so I wasn't a gooey
foundation today only because a little
bit over the hole on that thing I have
going on like every single week so the
foundation is go on and I am in so much
pain because a lot of you know that I
wear contact lenses for my vision and my
left continent is virtually like folded
over itself and its course very much
pain I'm just like don't remember I wake
up don't I'm gonna use the Rimmel wake
me up concealer in the shade ivory and
I'm just going to pop this underneath my
eyes and then what I'm going to do is
just take my finger and blend out all
the big blobs and then I'm taking my
sponge once again and I'm just going to
fully blend this out and then we're just
gonna repeat this on the other side so I
want to give a quick little shout-out
because this morning I went to my peanut
box and I had this lovely head up from
this girl and sent it to me all the way
from the Czech Republic and I was like
what and she sent me these gorgeous
little earrings are like little foxes I
just wanted to give you a shout out
because I know you watch my videos to be
just like any so
really I couldn't say thank you pretty
amazing when I think about the fact that
you guys are like all over the world
you're not just in my backyard you know
like yeah everywhere
and I love when you guys comment stuff
like my greetings from Argentina or
greetings from Saudi Arabia and a list
off kind of like oh this is so cool so
please don't you know where you're from
in the comments today that can be your
little comment for this video just stop
this video now and tell me in the
comments where you're wrong because it
interests me so much I think it's just
like the most amazing thing and how it
also connected but we love each other
about the little hair sweep I've got guy
and it's just keeping the hair out of my
face I'm using the hoola bronzer by
benefit on my cheeks today and I have so
fallen in love with this bronzer lately
it is it's just such a nice shade
because it's not like super super super
harsh but it's not orange as well so I
love it and then I'm also going to pop a
little bit of it onto my temples and the
forehead and now I'm taking the a banana
powder from the Australis FC onto a
contouring kit and I'm just going to
place this underneath my eyes just to
lighten it up and set the concealer as
you can see it makes a really big
difference result also I'm starting to
get the foundation lines going on with
my mouth so I started looking pretty 60
now I'm taking this NYX baked blush in
okay and I'm
to pop this on my cheeks just see
dressed a little bit of a shimmer each
time you know go away so I'm just gonna
grab a small type of blending brush and
I'm going to use this brown shade here
from the chocolate bar palette and I'm
just gonna run this down my lower lash
line and now I'm taking the I forest
charcoal pencil and I'm just going to
run this along my waterline looking like
water line and just darken this up a
little bit but I'm only gonna go around
the middle of my life and now I'm taking
some mascara from before which I was
using the masterpiece transform from Mac
Specter and I'm just placing this on my
little tiny baby lashes underneath my
eye so now I'm taking the chichi creamy
matte liquid lipstick in a calendar girl
and we're gonna try this on our lips
because it's a very um brownish need and
I just don't really go to the bosses
normally I thought that I would try and
do so many different booths looks very
gooey and glowy and
so thank you guys so much for watching
today it means the world to me don't
forget to check out Chloe's video as
well I will leave the link in the
description books to you guys and I
really hope that you have a great
weekend bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
