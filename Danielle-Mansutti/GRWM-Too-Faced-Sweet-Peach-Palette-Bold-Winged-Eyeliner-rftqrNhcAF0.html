in today's video we are going to be
talking about the sweet peach palette
okay this oh my god smells even better
than the top of our palettes in my
opinion just have a look at how
ridiculously beautiful it is this
palette is sort of like my dream card as
many of you know because look at all the
warm shades yes silica which palette has
a variety of mattes and shimmers it is
primarily warm and there are a few
random colors just to give you
everything you need really and of course
I wanted to make a peachy inspired
makeup look so I've gone with a lot of
pinks if you do not want to see a pink
makeup tutorial then please do not watch
this yes it is another pink makeup
tutorials and it's obviously match it
with a bold winged eyeliner which is
always a drama doing eyeliner but I
thought I haven't done it in ages so I
thought I would do winged eyeliner as
well the packaging of this palette is
absolutely stunning I absolutely love it
and I definitely recommend that you guys
get your hands on it so without further
ado let's join me - uh-oh
Oh
Oh
what I hear do you care if I care
do you know we share
thank you guys so much for watching this
tutorial please feel free to leave any
suggestions in the comments for videos
you like to see in the future so until
next time guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
