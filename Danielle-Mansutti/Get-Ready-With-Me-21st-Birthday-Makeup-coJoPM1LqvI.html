today I'm using me remote fixed and
protect primer just to shelter my skin
from pollution it filters out harmful UV
rays and it will help my skin stay
modified for seven hours thank you
matching it from the Rimmel match
perfection foundation I chose this one
because of its weightless smooth formula
I am obsessed with it this foundation
comes with a pump which you guys know
I'm obsessed with I love it when it
comes with a pump so that's why I've
done it around my face evenly and then
I'm just going to spread this out with
my Beauty Blender and put it in it also
has a 24 hour moisture vitamin E and SPF
20 I'm also going to drag the foundation
down my neck onto my ears and literally
all over my face just to make sure
everything's blended there moving onto
your concealer I'm using with Smashbox
high definition concealer I'm just
starting this under my eyes and then
we're gonna blend blend blend blend and
blend it out with a Beauty Blender so I
like to use the tip of the Beauty
Blender first after I've use it all
around my eyes I use the bum side I call
it the greedy founders to the bottom oh
yeah we use that side on the rest of our
face to blend everything yeah make sure
there's no harsh lines and everything
looks very natural
now with the NARS pressed powder in
Beach I'm hitting the pen on this and it
is making me very sad but I love it so
much I decided to use this powder
because it is my favorite powder of all
time and it makes your skin look so nice
and photos as well so then when we onto
eyebrows I'm using the deep dark
brunette fluidline brow gel cream by Mac
and we're gonna go and but we're filling
in the eyebrows and you guys have seen
me do this a million and one time so not
much to say everyone's eye shadow I'm
starting with creme brulee by makeup
geek I'm just going to put this in my
crease as a transition shade then I'm
using Coco bear and I'm going to use
this in the same area as the transition
shade but not put it up as high if you
know what I mean so we're just going to
stick to the crease
now with magic act aka the most
beautiful passionate ever I'm gonna put
this on my lid however I did actually
take this off in the end but I just
included it because I wanted to show you
how I got ready but I decided maybe not
but anyway we went with flame Farah put
that in my crease again and I use a
pencil brush but it's my crease to make
it more defined and sort of make a
little bit of a cut crease while we're
going with it
then I use this amazing Mac dazzle
shadow and I put this on my lids on top
of the gold like I said I just got rid
of it I don't know why I just thought
pink looks better and then I'm just
putting a little bit of a wing on to my
eyes I just used the AMC eyeliner gel
from Inglot and I'm using a on a wing
brush
it's time for some lashes I use these
Cara lashes my faves and I was having a
bit of trouble with them but they stayed
thank God so just with all the XS that
was on that brush from before I decided
to use this on my lower lash line just
to give it a little bit more depth
underneath the eye
with the IRS black eyeliner I'm just
popping this in my waterline it lasts so
long I love this product
now with Bahama Mama I decided to carve
out my cheekbones to make myself look
super chiseled for my birthday so I use
the contour brush to apply it and then I
blended it out with a big fluffy brush I
also decided to put a little bit down my
nose as well just to give it the
appearance that it's super straight and
skinny and then with the matte gold
deposit I'm just going over all those
areas and I was patting that onto my
skin it gives a really lovely glow and
it looks amazing in photos definitely
recommend it how many times do I use
this way too many
then using hot mama by the bottom I'm
using this on the apples of my cheeks I
know this is very similar to a lot of my
tutorials but this is like my favorite
makeup look so sorry if it's repetitive
but I love these products so much guys
then I'm using the Mac Studio Fix powder
and I'm just going to put this in a
little triangle section under my eyes
just for extra coverage now free flow
we're using champagne pop and I'm using
a fan brush to apply this to my
cheekbones and can I just say if you do
not have champagne pop guys get it for
Christmas it's so good I just can't get
over it it's amazing finally on to the
lips we're using the cherry a lip liner
by Mac and then I'm adding the jeffree
star liquid lipstick over the top
that's the finished look I really hope
you guys enjoyed this get ready with me
for my birthday
and we'll chat in the comments I'll see
you soon guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
