today's video we are doing a date night
get ready with me I'm going out tonight
on a date so I figured I would kind of
film everything from start to finish my
hair is literally dripping white in
hotel when we start this video so
everything from my makeup to my hair to
my fragrance eyes I'm gonna clean
everything that you guys need to know
about how to get ready for a nice little
date night even if it is a don't like
with your friends like this could work
for anything it's so wearable girly and
pink and a bit glowy winged eyeliner
lashes I mean you can't go wrong with
that so I hope you guys enjoy this video
and wear that further ado let's get into
it
so looking fabulous right now this naked
base glory I've just washed my hair and
to prime today I'm gonna use the cover
effects blurring primer I must say
though this is a pretty good look is
enough it feels like so long because
I've sat down and film like a proper
makeup tutorial so I've made this little
cording here like a work corner and I
kinda really like it so you guys think
ourselves so we are primed and I might
just do my foundation now with my towel
still arms because like pull back on my
hair and I can only get right in there
so I don't have like really attractive
or white hair line that I always have
don't do it now I'm not just using a
Beauty Blender and foundation should I
use this might be a little bit hmm no
that should be alright so I'm going to
use the D cover FX power play foundation
this one is in G 15 I love this
foundation I think it's good using the
same brands primer as their foundation
as well because you know they're gonna
work together and they're designed to
work together so I think that blurring
primer will be fantastic with this
foundation as well
does my brows today I'm actually gonna
use the Primark iconic brow it is so
good if you haven't seen my Primark
makeup video check it out I was
literally floored I'm going to take the
hourglass arched brow gel this is like a
kind of brunette 501 the large side is
really good if I'm just like running out
the house but like the kind of fella
perfect and also don't mind this kind of
matted whatever we will deal with that
in a second so I'm gonna do my concealer
I'm going to be using of course my Tarte
shape tape I'm actually nice medium
still my college absolutely everywhere I
feel like for this look today I want to
be kind of I can't say natural because
it is not gonna be natural but I don't
want to go too crazy with the eye shadow
I just feel like liner and lashes you
just you can't go wrong with that ever
now I'm gonna do something risky here
that I never do but I just want to do it
because this is a benefit hoola contour
stick now if you guys watch my videos
you know I never use like cream contours
or anything like this but I kind of feel
like why not so it's gonna put a bit
like in the shadowy parts of my face I
did use this once on the benefit motive
strip which I will link here if you guys
haven't seen that and I really loved it
I found that it did blend in really
nicely alright look at him fab so lets
blend listen I'm just gonna use my
Beauty Blender and we need the bottom
side of this is not a foundation
sticking to it and I'm going to blend
it's blending so nicely that's so good
why do I not use them I don't understand
they're really good and just do it pop
I'm gonna top of that I'm going to use
the two-faced son money for ronzo I was
gonna place this over where we put the
contour stick so I'm glad the ball and
so glowy it's before I forget I made so
I'm clear this because why not
but if we're gonna contour one area of
our body we might as well contour the
other areas come on I'll get the boys
out I'm gonna contour my babies yeah
how's life guys been up too much so it
is time to do something with our eyes
I'm really gonna change myself to not do
something rose gold or copper is you
guys like neutral what do I have which
is neutral you know what I'm just gonna
go ahead and do my highlight first I'm
gonna use this artist kit sure this is
in cocoa bling let me go ahead and pop
that on and then blend it in and we just
I think I finally just had already
hardly ever do just nuts or neutrals or
anything so I'm thinking like these here
somebody's a really big brush this is a
more for the m5 11 I'm gonna go ahead
and start with a bit of metal in and see
what he does but we're definitely gonna
do a winged eyeliner today in big lashes
and I think that when you have big
lashes they kind of just counteract any
how much honey you've done really so
doesn't really matter too much I think
I'll just play with depths and
everything and kind of work you know
from dark to light and I'm gonna take
Matt Evans
so today going on a day which is really
exciting so on Valentine's Day a little
bit of backstory anyone knows me very
well that you know that I love the
liking and if you follow me on Spotify
you would have known for years that I
have like a soundtracks playlist which
is pretty much dedicated to like liking
music as well I know that's kind of
weird I don't really talk about it too
much that I am like I just find it like
extremely nostalgic and company and I
think I've one time ever mentioned that
to my boyfriend and for Valentine's Day
he surprised me with tickets to see the
Lion King in Theatre in London's that's
what we're doing tonight and he's such a
sweetheart like I'm like so I'm gonna
add a bit of Matt Kumar kind of it's a
reddish color I don't know if this is
gonna be a really bad idea I'm using a
morphe M 505 right now and I'm just
gonna pop him on the outer part of my
eye and see that does anything but any
of you guys big Disney fans like me as
well and if you are please comment below
what's your favorite Disney movie or
your favorite Disney character I'm just
not going up since about the age of four
and totally I'm just like Disney so it's
a little bit of play on the other eye
this is our glasses mom's one flash I'm
going to take a little bit on my finger
and then I think gold kind of going into
purple was actually surprisingly really
some eyeliner this to me so bad to tell
camera I'm gonna actually do the other
one off camera so I can copy it on but
there's always a lot of pressure what
they say let's get into it I'm using the
color cosmetics black gel liner and a
zoeva
three-one-seven winged liner brush and
for my lashes today I'm going to be
using Anna Lux collection these ones are
in the style selfie black like all over
my hands let's get these bad boys on and
tada they are on with a sigma small
tapered blending brush I'm gonna go in
with the same color that we use on a
crease
I'm just gonna take a little bit of
mascara I'm gonna pop that on
actually I'm not gonna use better than
sex because I just do some date but I
guess in mascara I'm gonna use the it
cosmetics superhero mascara and I'm
gonna pop that on my bottom lashes okay
sweet if I go any more I think that's
gonna look Columbo I'm gonna grab the
etosha Salina and I'm gonna use the
pencil side just to do half of my lower
lash line so I'm not gonna go all the
way I'm gonna go that half way so I'm
thinking we have got lips and then we've
got hair like I am including my hair I'm
my fragrances everything so it's my
lipstick I just wanna give a quick
little explanation about this a little
while ago I did a photo on Instagram and
I said I used the jeffree star liquid
lipstick in Christmas cookie this was
sent to me by beautybay in a PR package
I didn't advise from where money sent to
me I tried it and I really love the
formula I never tried any of Jeffrey's
products before so I was really
impressed with the color of the formula
and how long it lasted other day and
because this is a date night I want to
wear a lipstick which isn't going to
come off if you know everything will be
taken as a drama whether I ignore
addressing this or I do address this for
me post in the past I have felt a little
bit uncomfortable why Jeffrey's actions
and that led me to not really want to
use his products on my channel now I
take someone for how they treatin me not
what I see online because I know from
experience of being a youtuber that half
of things you see in read online but
people are just absolute fabrications
and they're not true I just believe each
to their own it's just a makeup product
I wouldn't actively go out and buy my
own Jeffrey star products anything like
that but I do actually really like this
product so I'm just gonna be honest to
have a that's why I'm using it
that's kind of what my heads out so I
hope that make sense so I'm gonna start
by using the colour-pop
BFF line on my lips and I'm gonna take
the Christmas cookie at lipstick and pop
that on
so I'm feeling curls I was actually sent
this GHD just says tri-zone technology
so I think I got this yesterday in the
mail was not expecting out all so very
very very sense to use it and I thought
today would be nice day to give it a go
give it a test and see if it works and
I'm just gonna grab a section I see the
one gets smaller oh you know you should
go inside actually great really nice
kind of cold it's sort of like leaves a
top quite flat and then the bottom
really cold
Joshu they like nice so gonna use this
hairspray which is by L'Oreal and then
I'm gonna give it a bit of a spirit and
then I'm gonna do is scrunch my hair
upwards so just even more like a kind of
big bouncy voluminous or voluminous
whatever you want to say wave my hair is
looking slightly big right now I'm just
gonna finish off everything by
highlighting my body so I'm just gonna
grab an O for this is the blissful
highlight and what I like to do I'm
trying my best not to get it on my top
ears pop a bit of highlight on my collar
bones and then the last thing that I
would do in this situation is put on my
perfume and obviously get my coat get my
bag and run out the house and the
perfume that I'm gonna wear today is the
Viktor and Rolf flower bomb as you can
see nearly out this is my third bottle
that I've ever had
I will they start my hair just going all
in my last day I used to wear this all
the time when I was at school I think
all University and loved it and then
when I run out of my second bottle I
just didn't top up I fell in love with a
different perfume and then I recently
got this again and I realized how much I
loved it I love when you just recover
perfume in your life
yes that is nice also be wearing a wire
sell black opium at the minute they
might to kind of go to sentence if you
know of any sense of the very similar to
that opium or flower bomb let me know
because you know from that I'm a very
kind of florally sweet kind of person so
I love bonbon as well by Viktor and Rolf
I love to see by George Armani but my
kind of went off because it's in the
sunlight so it's not something too good
and then I think that is everything done
are needed for the date night tonight so
I'm gonna grab a coat I'm gonna grab
something nice and long because it is
freezing outside and I'm going to you
head off so hope you guys enjoyed this
style the video I had so much fun
filming it for you it feels like the
longest time so film like this kind of
sit down proper tutorial video and I
absolutely love making it so let me know
what you think and until next time guys
