life foundation in Barcelona oh my god
obsessed I love love love the foundation
so as you saw I was just using my
fingers to a pipe onto my skin and then
using a big fat fluffy brush to blend it
all over moving on to brows I'm using
the Mac deep dark brunette fluidline
brow gel cream on my brows just to
thicken them up a little bit because
they were looking a little bit sad and
thin today
the concealer I'm using the Rimmel wake
me up concealer I'm just going to put
this under my eyes to literally wake me
up maybe look a little bit more
refreshed and awake and alive and ready
to party at the festival whoo moving on
to powder I'm using the Rimmel stay
matte powder and just putting this all
over my face so at this part I sort of
realized I'm still wearing a Fitbit that
is pretty ugly on camera using this
Desilu eyeshadow from Mac I'm actually
just going to apply it with my fingers
because it's such a gorgeous shade and
I'm not really mixing it with any other
eyeshadow so I thought I'm gonna go old
school and use my fingers
I'm now using me English eyeliner gel on
my eye I'm just using this as a nice
wing on my eyes and starting from the
outer corner of my eye working my way
inwards
I'm not making this wing too dramatic
just very very very simple I hate the
curling my lashes it hurts so much I'm
using the roller lash by benefit on my
lashes another thing that I love are
just uses everyday it just really
separates my lashes and makes them look
really nice
using the hoola bronzer by benefit a
golden ollie and I still love it so much
I'm using this as my bronzer and my
contour so I'm just popping this in my
cheekbone area and then I'm just working
it up to my temples and my forehead a
little trick for you guys just grab a
small fluffy brush and also apply it
down the sides of your nose as well just
to match the cheekbone shade and I'm
also using this fluffy brush in the
crease of my eye it's because it creates
a really nice deep transition shade
using hot mama by the balm I'm using
this blush on my cheeks just for a
little bit of a pop of color
using matte gold deposit aka my favorite
product of all time I'm just going to
use this on my cheekbones and up to my
forehead and this is something that I'm
currently like raving about this is the
what's up by benefit highlighter just
look at that oh my god no words negative
moving on to the Mac and night mouth a
lip liner I'm just using this to line my
lips because we're creating a little bit
of a gradient with our lips today the
lip liner is darker than the lipstick it
looks really cool once it's all together
now using media by Mac I'm just applying
this onto my lips we create a sort of
nice red to black gradient with our lips
using the combination of the lip liner
and the lipstick now missing the NYX
roll on shimmer and I'm just dotting
this on my forehead because it is a
festival get ready with me and I thought
mmm may as well bring out the glitter so
I'm also using a pink one and I'm just
also popping this above my eyebrows and
then I also decided to do a little bit
underneath my eyes as well and that is
the finished look I really hope that you
enjoyed this get ready with me and
please leave any comments below
bye today I have done a full / autumn
makeup tutorial I also offered two
different lip options</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
