or welcome to my channel if you're new
today I've created a get ready with me
for holidays sort of festive season and
this is all revolved around like my
holiday fantasy so basically what my
perfect Christmas Day and Christmas
party look is all in one so festive oh
well I think this would work really well
for a Christmas play and would still
work really well just for Christmas Day
or something more casual like that
my holiday fantasy this year is to get a
pug I think we all know that this will
be like sitting under my tree except it
won't be a stuffed one um it would be a
real one
so let me know what your holiday fantasy
is down in the comments and let's jump
straight into it me get ready with me I
really hope that you guys enjoy this
it's so fun for Christmas and let's jump
straight into it
the first things first of course I'm
brushing my teeth in the morning got to
make sure we have some minty fresh
breath and then after I brush my teeth I
love to moisturize before I do my makeup
I think this is so important and it just
makes your skin ready for makeup
application and then I'm going to go
ahead and brush all the knots out of my
hair and make it a lot smoother
moving on to makeup I'm starting with my
foundation and just starting it all
around my face and I'm just taking a
flat top brush and buffing it into my
skin then taking a concealer I'm just
going to put this underneath my eyes and
also on the top of my eyelid just to
give me the appearance that I'm super
awake and ready for opening Christmas
present I just carry I'm blending that
until there are no harsh lines and then
apply a powder over the top of the skin
makeup just to set everything
next step is browse and I'm just going
to fill them in really quickly you guys
to see me do this at you time
I have to say I am obsessed with off of
our shoulders at the moment so I'm just
using one on my lid in my crease and
just keep blending and burning burning
until it's nice and flawless and then
I'm using this gorgeous shadow called
glitterati by colour-pop this really
Christmassy silver one and just packing
that all over my legs like all over and
then I'm using their dgaf collar pop
eyes shadow and I'm going to put this in
the outer part of my eye and sort of
make a gradient between the gold and the
silver but it looks kind of pink on my
eye but it's meant to be cold
weird isn't it then I'm just going to
apply some mascara
I got a lash lift recently and oh my god
guys I recommend it so much look how
different my lashes look then I'm just
going to use a bronzer on my cheekbones
and also on my temples and up to my
forehead just to give my face a bit more
depth and definition and then after I
apply the bronzer I like to carry on
with a blush
I think blush is really really really
nice for Christmas as well because you
just want to look really pretty and bit
colorful with of course we're going to
do a highlight why not I'm also putting
it in to help my nose and then I'm using
the Anastasia Beverly Hills candy apple
liquid lipstick on my lips it is a lot
more read in person the camera made it
look a little bit pink but it's amazing
I love it and then moving on to our
outfit um BRB to accessorize with my
outfit I'm using my favorite perfume at
the moment which is fantasy Britney
Spears it's sort of a nice it sort of
has like a mix of red light key exotic
Kiwi the fragrance combined succulent
fruits and Brittany's favorite white
florals to create a really sensual
fragrance it's just absolutely gorgeous
I am obsessed with it and then I'm just
pairing up my outfit with this gorgeous
little coat from forever new it's like a
cute little Marini plum color and it's
so cute for Christmas and these are my
favorite white shoes they're from Zoo
and yeah they just go
and now I'm just packing my bag getting
everything ready that I'm going to need
for the day for the Christmas party or
just the Christmas Day and just popping
it all into my purse and then once my
purse is packed it's ready to get going
put on my coat and that's it guys I
really hope that you enjoy this get
ready with me and I'll see you next time
