hangover primer today this is the best
primer for any long-lasting event and
then of course using my trusty and NARS
sheer glow foundation I'm gonna buff it
into my skin
now even is it cosmetics concealer and I
know it looks so white on me but that's
a good thing we'll blend it out guys
don't stir it so I use this because I
wanted it to really like open my eyes
because I was really tired so when I set
it with my NARS pressed powder I use the
one in Beach you'll be able to see the
huge difference it makes between the
bilenda third and the more London side
as I'm demonstrating for you guys there
you can see it's just so much nicer once
the powders over it then is the steel
eyes are the window palette in soul and
I'm beginning with this little matte
brown shade in my crease and I'm just
using it as elaborate red transition
shade and just buffing it into that
crease
now using this pink color and don't
stress guys it isn't another pink
eyeshadow tutorial I promise I change it
up later on but I'm just showing you
what I do in the day so don't freak out
yeah I do decide to not use that pink
thing in the end I went over it so no
use a sort of sparkly purple brown shade
it was kind of weird but I didn't really
know if I liked it or not so as you can
see I keep lying things on top of it and
whatever and say yeah ice but that it
might add a third then I went over
everything with this really matte brown
shade in my outer third as well and then
I continued to blend that out with a
fluffy clean blending brush then I used
the gorgeous kitten shade from the steel
palette and I use this all over my
latest for bit of sparkle his look was
just looking waiting matte and then of
course using another claim brush I was
gonna say blush to blend it out I also
put heaps of it on the inner corner of
my eyes well just to make my eyes pop
even more then I use the benefit roller
lash mascara on my lashes I didn't any
falsies on because I hate wearing
falsies at festivals so annoying and
even the hoola bronzer by benefit I
learned this trick from Chinese so thank
you just to get a nice straight line I'm
using my powder there and then blending
it all out
I also put some down my chin as well
just with photos you know you know how
it isn't that it gives my back girl to
pause it and just put that over the top
of everything separate my hair up
because it was oiling hard I just used
more of the NAS powder from before
underneath my eyes just to make sure
that everything was nice and covered
then I used the champagne pop Becca
highlight by jaclyn hill on my
cheekbones and
then I use the Urban Decay all nighter
makeup setting spray and I just put my
face right into it and I use the
Anastasia brow Pro palette I did get my
eyes feather brow tattered so I only
have to put a tiny bit of powder over
the top now just to make sure there's no
little holes in my eyebrows or anything
like that
and how I'm pulling so many weird faces
there and then using the lipliner saw by
Mac on my lips and I'm following this
with the best that sick of all time
which is modesty by Mac
that is how I got ready for Stereosonic
I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll be
seeing you really soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
