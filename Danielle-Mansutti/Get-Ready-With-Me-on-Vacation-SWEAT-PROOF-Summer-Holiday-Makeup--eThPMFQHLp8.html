very appropriate dress today
Nik and I arrived in a crete this
morning and I am just filming I get
ready with me because this background is
stunning the makeup look that I'm doing
today it's kind of inspired by like
sweat proof
holiday makeup so it's still glowing
this is kind of like we're doing natural
sweat but in the right place is not here
which I always went here and here we're
keeping it going it's simple I'll show
my - can you see you guys can actually
wear makeup on holiday if you want to do
that and it doesn't like just slip and
slide all over your face like a melted
candle because I've been no one too many
times and it isn't very attractive if
you guys are going out for dinner or
something on holiday or just doing
anything fun I would completely
recommend doing this tutorials if you
want to see how I achieve this and then
I think this is quite easily the best
background I've ever my skin makeup
because I'm holiday I think it's best to
go with low coverage instead of really
full cakey makeup because I want to look
like just having nice glowy skin really
natural really summery so many is the
giorgio armani face about break this is
the second skin makeup and it is in five
white boys and love this because you
guys will see when I put on it doesn't
actually look like foundation which we
just want people to think I only have
really nice skin you'll see when I blend
it just kind of like covers all day
north of this I'm gonna jump in with the
concealer neck so this gives the beach
type type in medium it's in my little
like a plastic bag and I'm just gonna
pop I do feel that with all that makeup
because here right now it's about 35
Celsius it's really really really warm
so obviously me thanks but I'm gonna
sweat so I find with makeup and holiday
sometimes unless now that we have Fila
on we're gonna just power up underneath
our eyes I'm not gonna go crazy and go
or wear on my face today because amazing
the hourglass veil primer as well I'm
not gonna go over my face again five too
much powder on my sweat is very obvious
but this with the Beauty Blender
underneath my eyes to set the concealer
so I feel like my skin color isn't that
different from when we started maybe
it's a little bit darker I'm wearing so
much fake town on this holiday though
because I don't really like to turn
naturally I'm the kind of person that
was sitting there something like five
minutes I just want to leave as I'm sure
you know the thing is with sweat if your
foundation it's really having it really
cakey really brown and you're really
pale underneath then it's gonna look a
little bit like oh god and that's when
it's gonna show so we don't want that
obviously so that's why I don't put
powder like everywhere cuz I just feel
like I don't know it's too obvious when
I sweat most important step I feel is
bronzer but any holiday makeup I'm using
the hoola bronzer by benefit I'm also
gonna use him in my crease as well and
this makeup look is really really quick
too I think if I wasn't actually filming
I probably get this done 10 minutes like
it's really fast I caught my arm is so
Brown for once compared to my face this
is like my hand actually definitely
fatal ones I do but I've done this
really quick already was it being that
half an hour all right I'm gonna tuck
these brows now I've been doing I can't
say it's lazy actually think it's really
instead of taking a million eyebrow
products I have been using the Tarte
toasted palette to do my eyebrows I
don't know why I did it in New York
because I didn't have the right eyebrow
products and I started using this shade
which is fireside fell in love with it
and now it's like my eyebrow shade which
it did Tennant my eyebrows recently but
as you can see the foundation is just we
are staying as you guys can see behind
us at and the most beautiful it was all
ever like I hadn't actually hit me at we
arrived here a few hours ago and it's
just dreaming if it doesn't actually
feel real yet is it dials with Dale's
day of scope I keep saying dial it might
be does your the great corn you went to
know those days day off like good day I
literally feel so much more like myself
now am i back on that was such a
disaster like I just realized I forgot
my flat brush so I had to clean them
with a q-tip but I just smudged
eyeshadow like well in my face and it
was just really hot I'm just hoping that
by the end of the night we play the
traditional Greek song with Slash and
play it's because I'm dressed for
everybody so I'm gonna go in with this
one which is called a latte and I'm
gonna just really messily place that
over the entire lid and then blend it I
will then grab a small brush that was a
multi m5o fight that I used and I'm
going to use a sigma e45 weave this one
called warm and I'm gonna place him just
closer to my lashline then I'm gonna
grab cozy again placing that in the same
bit blend that awkward so it's like a
continuous gradient and we can't see
where one shadow starts and one to end
is the goal I'm gonna grab loss again on
that brush and latte
let's go nope bad girl bang on the
lashes this is the artist good shot this
is in it's called lickable noise texture
this is like a super super bronzy my
lipsticks trick I guess guys you're
gonna get it right anyway it's velvet
teddy by Mac my absolute they live right
now one thing left to do which probably
be most important step in the whole
routine to stop me from sweating is of
course using the urban decay setting
spray this is such a game changer when
it comes to face weights if you like me
and you're unfortunate enough to get the
little Tash wet you need this this is a
little travel size one as well because
the big one is quite bulky but I'm
pretty sure at Sephora or anything like
that you can just find these sizes
honestly this just changes everything
there was like a festival I went to once
and I should try out this it was like 40
Celsius one day it did the exact same
makeup did the exact same dance didn't
wear it and then one day I did and the
difference was in sight and I'm like a
massive thanks for this that was like a
big deal for me and I would now say that
this is the makeup look complete and it
definitely is complete because nick has
fallen asleep we've kept it really fresh
really glowy really summery all these
tips should help you guys to stop it
sweating so much in holiday because I've
tried and tested this a lot I mean I
can't ever stop the fact that I do swear
my Mari but my putting less products on
it it doesn't look as bad when it does
where did that make sense hope that this
helps you guys I hope you enjoyed this
gorgeous view I actually feel like I'm
sitting in a studio with a fake back job
like it is so stunning I hope you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you all in my next
