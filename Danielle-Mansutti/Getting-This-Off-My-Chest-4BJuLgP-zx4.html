gonna have a chat there's lots of things
that are on my mind that I like to talk
about and I've been thinking about for
so long and I just feel like isn't
spoken about especially in the beauty
community it's not working about I have
seen many videos on this in like the
entertainment community the gaming
community in for some reason it's just a
little bit quiet in the beauty community
so this is stuff I want to talk about
but there's also some personal stuff
that I want to talk about which kind of
links into it all together I feel like
this is such a wide problem for so many
creative and also for so many creators
that have such a small voice so they
feel like they won't be heard and my
channel is very small why I consider
myself a small Channel when you look at
like all the channels in YouTube I
consider my channel to be quite small
one so it's quite hard my voice to be
heard but it's always worth the shot and
if this means that a channel through the
line with the same issues can be heard
for the same reasons then that will be
amazing so I don't know how you are
aware that that's happening but a few
weeks ago someone at YouTube entered a
code which basically meant that they
decided to filter out a lot of videos of
restricted mode and it included the
entire LGBTQ community so anyone that
had anything to do with that community
was just filtered out and disappeared
immediately I also have people telling
me on Twitter that my videos about
mental health and anti bullying which I
have created solely for people that
aren't young and experiencing it at
school especially that they had
disappeared for them on restricted mode
that was so incredibly just offensive
and hurtful because it was to say what
is and what isn't
right like how can you discriminate
against like entire sexual orientations
just because of who they are did not sit
ok with me at all
literally the stigma that I fight
against when it comes to mental health
which is that it's wrong and it's taboo
and I want to talk about the fact that
those are being restricted for me it
just kind of was like a slap in the face
because everything that I'm fighting
against because I won't be able to
openly talk about depression and openly
talk about bullying and stuff
so that was really quite hard to see
that happening I dunno for my channel
now that a lot of my anti-bullying
videos and stuff are coming up which is
great so it seems that they did speak
something but at the end of the day
there was still someone that works at
YouTube that entered a code to
deliberately filter out those kind of
things and honestly look you just have
to stop a bit how many young people are
going to be searching things when they
have no one else to turn to that's what
YouTube is each of is a community where
we share things because we are people
talking to people if there's someone who
is 13 and they're confused and they just
feel like they need advice from someone
who is in the LGBTQ community the fact
that they can't access it with a chips
mode is just so wrong I guess so wrong
it makes no sense to me so when I saw
that happening I was literally like what
is happening to you to like who is
deciding this who's sitting in a border
and thinking you know it'd be a good
idea like you can filter out this whole
group of people like it's just it's so
wrong but when you look into it
unfortunately and this is where every
corporation is when you ask why are they
doing that the answer most likely is for
money so when you have advertisers
coming along I want to place premium ads
on videos
it's the advertisers that would probably
say to YouTube so we have this ad which
is about X Y Z but we don't want it
associated with this kind of group or
that kind of group and I believe in the
theory that YouTube is like testing
these filtering out things so that when
it comes to them being what our YouTube
TV thing which I will get into soon it's
almost like they're preparing for these
premium advertisers all that is like
doesn't make sense to me because I'm
someone who believes that you are equal
no matter what your sexual orientation
your gender your religion if you're a
refugee asylum seeker I don't care like
every single person in this entire load
is equal to me I don't believe in anyone
being superior and that's why I can't
see why certain people being filled out
is because of who they are and
I do think of money as a lot to do with
it and I do think there's so many
underlying reasons why YouTube is doing
these certain changes now for me
personally I'm having a big issue with
my channel people being unsubscribed for
my channel without realizing and may not
show up in their subscription feeds at
all it is incredibly frustrating because
it feels like I'm shouting at a wall
sometimes because there's literally like
nothing I can do about it it it's like
I'm doing everything I can to be you
should be to be created to create good
content and the fact that like I have
these forces working against me it's
just so disheartening and just so
infuriating as well I have made an
Instagram post yesterday saying
basically touching on a few of these
topics and so many people commented
being like oh my god I'm unsubscribing
the channel
I never unsubscribe I know what's
happening and then recently it was shown
that there was a glitch on YouTube which
I believe is still happening where if
someone unsubscribes from your channel
it actually ends up being two people
that have unsubscribed there's a reason
why you should have chosen to do that
like that doesn't just like pop up
overnight like it's something that in
the coding of the website so many people
saying I never saw that video and it
became up in my subscription box and
it's just fine and I've also notice I
get like 100 unsubscribe instantly
whenever I upload a video which is very
weird as well there's a Serie I've heard
when it comes to the whole on
subscribing date and basically if your
channel it's not like a hundred percent
family-friendly I mean personally I
don't really curse often in my videos or
have anything that offensive but I do
know that I have spoken pass about
things like sex and bullying and mental
health and some reason some people this
is not appropriate for all audiences
which is you know their opinion that's
fine therefore if my channel is not 100%
family-friendly then it seemed that this
unsubscription glitch seems to happen so
this glitch doesn't seem to happen to
channels that are like 100%
squeaky-clean channels and it seems to
happen to us instead and there's a big
theory about this basically were now
that you should
more like commercial TV on YouTube maybe
it's way for them to kind of filter out
these independent craters that they
dislike and I personally have seen
especially when I go to the US because I
always find it amazing that they
actually have billboards promoting
youtubers and stuff like that in the US
because it's like unheard of in
Australia but it's almost like every
single YouTube event that I attend or
every single billboard or advertising
material I see for YouTube they are
always pushing the same creator there's
always like three creators that have
like million subscribers that they
always push on all their billboards and
everything and these creators are
family-friendly and used to swear in
their videos now we'll say like what the
ask instead of actually looks worried
they've almost like changed the way they
are to be like this commercial
family-friendly thing and obviously they
work there with YouTube to come that way
and I YouTube's promoting them
everywhere but I never really see
creators like PewDiePie or jenna Marbles
advertise anywhere and it makes you
think like is it because they are not
squeaky clean channels they are
suffering from this glitch is what
PewDiePie has made a lot of videos about
it as well and it is very interesting
that channels are a squeaky clean don't
have this glitch and it's just like
something's not quite adding up here and
I don't know there's too many things
it's just kind of point is just being
really fishy and really odd and we don't
know what the answers are this is just
like theories that are going around
because we're not getting any answers
from YouTube but also we just have to
come up with things that we think sound
right like we don't actually know how to
write or not something that I have found
very interesting observing as a creator
and also a viewer in fact over the past
year maybe two years definitely over the
past year YouTube started to become a
lot more commercial and a lot more TV
driven it was strange to see that the
amount of time for Gamma YouTube
homepage I would come across like Jimmy
Kimmel Allen VEVO like all those
channels would come up first for my like
recommendations or suggested watch or
whatever
and it was very interesting because
these are the kind of channels that are
paying to be you know the top only you
should like they're paying for exposure
and they want to be see and they want to
be clicked on and the way that things
work on YouTube essentially is that if
you log on and you see that there was a
video that was uploaded yesterday
and it has millions of views naturally
you have this curiosity of like oh my
god where this video that everyone's
watching and I'm not and you don't have
like the FOMO of not knowing where
everyone's talking about kind of
trending and every single time I go on a
trending page like TV related things and
it's very interesting because they will
pop up on your sidebar as well when
you're watching this video or whatever
like you may have suggestions for stuff
like Ellen and stuff like that and it's
very interesting that they started to do
that and then announced recently that
they're doing this whole YouTube TV
thing it all just kind of made sense to
me I was like ah so that's the direction
that they're heading they want to become
like a TV network and they want to
become more commercial and it kind of
contradicts so many things because I
feel as a viewer because I was a viewer
for like five years or five
pema creator and as a viewer YouTube is
a place where I like to watch people
being genuine people and I like to watch
TV for things that are scripted and more
commercial and all that kind of stuff
and even like reality shows on TV
they're not real to me but watching a
vlog or something is very real to me so
I enjoyed going to YouTube to come
across content that was extremely
relatable because it's just someone
going about their everyday like doing
the dishes and cooking their dinner or
whatever and then when I became a
creator I always wanted to include
things of me just being me in everyday
life like just me being goofy and stupid
and sarcastic like I am and showing that
like not being the squeaky clean kind of
TV girl I was the squeaky clean TV girls
like the first half of my youtube
channel guess I just sort of thought if
I'm a bit more like clean and
presentable as being like
it's like innocent girl-next-door kind
of thing then maybe that's what people
want to see that some people like I can
just imagine the kind of girl that
people would like and I pretended to be
her but then about a year ago so I
mentioned I really feel like I was being
under percent myself and then over the
past year I've just been like completely
how to present myself on my channel and
subsequently I've got a wireless
subscribers are being myself and I mean
that's the way it is like the more kind
of commercial blonde makeup Beauty kind
of girl I act the more subscribers I'm
going to get because that's the kind of
image that represents that community but
the more that I'm like sarcastic and
goofy and weird
the less people are going to come across
but it is a bit of hard interesting the
more on myself or less high for me but
at the same time I feel like the more
that I myself the more people will love
me for who I am you know and feel
connected to me and feel like they can
relate to me in my life and my content
so what I was just saying about how you
see these kind of TV channel clips
coming up in your suggested things we
were trending things all the time
you may see something that it's been
made by like an independent creator
that's been up for a day or so and say
doesn't have that many views your screen
thing art school video I'm not missing
out on much here by not watching it
recently on a few of my videos when I
upload the views froze for about 24
hours and have like 5 or 10,000 views
for 24 hours and then when it became
unstuck it's hard to gain views again
but it didn't gain the initial views
that it had over the big exposure time
of its first 24 hours and I was watching
the lives analytics of it and it didn't
add up at all there was something not
right you know having 5,000 being to 24
hours of like something isn't quite
adding up here and then one yet it
became one stuck I didn't gain back
through the original views and that was
so disheartening and I thought what is
going on you guys think if you two
pushing these commercial channels
because they are making them more money
and then when it comes to the solar
independent graders is that why they are
freezing our views our videos like
coming up with subscription boxes or
even we're losing views I was going to
use my video
I don't know how this can possibly
happen if I have ten views and how can I
possibly go back to eight you know ten
people have viewed it it can only go up
from that so it's very weird sometimes
when it goes like into a negative it
makes absolutely no sense I'm baffled by
how I can possibly lose you really small
channels or they're just starting it's
almost impossible for them to be
noticeable to be heard and the whole
reason why I want to do is for you as
well that I feel that there's so many
really small channels that probably
experienced the same thing that they
feel like no one's going to listen to
them if they talk about it I have a
romantic subscribers so it's like it's
decent platform I'm not a big channel at
all but I feel that I can actually say
something that might get noticed and
might actually help them be their voice
as well and it is just so unfair like
being a small Channel it's almost
impossible you know I have so many
friends so they want to start a YouTube
channel it's almost like that peak of
being a creators is gone like that peak
was like a year ago two years ago and
yes if some creators it's amazing like
everything is going amazingly well you
know I met nikkietutorials a you and a
bit ago and she had about a million
subscribers and now she has like six or
seven million or whatever ships in her
it's going amazing so that's great it's
not like this has happened to every
single creator but it's weird that it's
happening to some of us and we can't
figure out like why is it that things
just aren't working for us and it is so
hard and people say to me I really want
to be YouTube I want to start a YouTube
channel and it's almost like saying well
you know if nothing has changed to man
it's just not worth it it's really funny
actually because yesterday I was really
beating myself up about my channel my
views my subscribers I was looking at my
statistics and I was so upset because I
just thought why it is happening
genuinely thought people just don't like
when more that's what it is like people
don't like me I'm not good enough for
them anymore and I literally put it on
myself and then talking about it a
little bit on Twitter I had Gabby whose
velvet ghost who actually messaged me
and said I'm having the same thing with
my news and literally everything that
she said to me was exactly what I was
going through
hold on a minute it's not just me going
through this yes maybe it is that people
think of me maybe that is the reason I
don't know hopefully not I mean is how
you should glitch any other roles play
as well and it just sucks because I love
my job
like I love creating videos it's what I
do that's what my life is like I don't
leave work I sit and I research and a
constant watching tutorials like Final
Cut Pro and just how to become a better
creator it's so hard when I feel like my
content hasn't changed too much but no
one is seeing my videos in the
description box or the thing I subscribe
to me or my views are frozen and this is
my job this is my livelihood and it just
sucks kind of seeing something self
destruct right in front of your eyes and
you can't do anything about it and it's
like my little baby like my channel for
me it has been one of the most
unpredictable surprising and incredible
things and for the rest of my life this
whole like being a youtuber face of me
will just be something that I'll never
actually be able to even contemplate
that it happened because it's just been
such an incredible journey and I I feel
blessed every day to be a youtuber and
to be able to call this my job I just
wish that all this stuff wasn't
happening like it's just so hard to
constantly feel like a being kicked out
I get into face where I'm so unmotivated
so frustrated and so disheartened
because there's some videos I put so
much of my heart into it so much effort
into and I just feel like it doesn't
even matter into the day I could sit
down to a great drama and I get like
millions of views and it just sucks that
that's what you just become and so often
when I'm on YouTube in my suggestions I
always have the drama channels now I
feel like the drama channels weren't
even a thing until a year ago and you
know exactly who I'm talking about and I
don't need to name names here anything
especially in the beauty community if
you're watching and you're not in the
lifestyle Beauty community basically
being in the beauty community
essentially means that you are going to
be criticized on your appearance and who
you are and you're going to be
pretty much like picked apart as a
person by people I don't know you
haven't met you and a judging you from
your edited existence on a screen
essentially does what it is I just want
to go back to the days where the biggest
issue with YouTube was the ever-changing
layout like do you guys remember it's
just like oh my god the layout has
changed again and everyone was just
going crazy hard it like and that was
the biggest problem on YouTube that was
like the only and the biggest problem
was the layer guys don't talk much now
the drama channel's the thing that
doesn't sit well with me is how much you
should purchase them and promote them I
personally don't watch any drama
channels about any youtuber because I
know as a youtuber anything that they're
saying is untrue because unless you have
met the creator you know them well I
don't believe that anything that they
say is worth listening to because I'm
only going to listen to the source and
that is the youtuber so at the end of
the day I don't watch them so why do
they constantly keep coming up in my
suggestion box and obviously they're
tagging my name in their time as well
and it just sucks because I've worked so
hard on my content for so long and I
want it to be when you type in dating
methods my videos to come up not someone
speculating about me and my life instead
about like untrue rumors and everything
like that like it just it's incredibly
frustrating a job challenge didn't exist
that long ago and the reason why they
asked groom has taken off so fast is
because of their views because you know
people love love listening to the drama
and love kind of laughing about you know
someone else's issues it's why we watch
reality TV it's why people buy tabloids
something that's always been around it
doesn't sit well with me because I
really meant like genuinely genuinely
mess when YouTube was people sitting in
their bedroom and putting on their
makeup and just talking like I miss that
sorry you should so much and I
personally I can't relate to makeup
stores where they have like professional
lighting and professional backdrops and
a lot of these people who are lucky
enough to have their partners do a lot
of their filming and all of their
editing and that's amazing if you can
have your partner that can do that for
you you know I'm extremely
jealous of envious I wish I had that I
wish I had that into everything on my
own but essentially like personally it's
just my own opinion I literally can't
watch a makeup tutorial and I someone is
like sitting in a room or sitting in the
house anything because I can't connect
with it I can't relate to it I just feel
like so much of you should be just
becoming so commercialized and so
professional but I'm like I just missed
the authenticity and just genuine people
and just watching people be people and
there's still some people that I watch
that I feel are still true to that
that's why I'm such a big fan of so well
I because even though like her life is
so amazing and incredible and she's
achieved so many amazing things she's
still a person who goes around and
dusting and shows her being herself she
doesn't use like professional studios or
anything to film and personally as a
viewer that's what I like to watch and
for other viewers they may prefer to
watch professional things it's just a
matter of opinion I tried the whole
professional route I tried getting a
backdrop I tried you know really
professional lining and what to do
cameras and everything I personally felt
like it's very empty to me like I wasn't
showing off who I was in my personality
and I feel like when I sit on my bed
like I said like in my apartment and you
have like beans running around the
background she's currently like right
here Thanks um I feel like you see more
of me like that's who I am this is my
space like you're invited doing a friend
sitting with me and I find that really
difficult to come across now especially
with like big channels in the beauty
lifestyle community so I just kind of
feel in a way that everything is
becoming really sort of unrelatable in a
way like I feel that disconnecting other
Mary I just loved the way you should
used to be and I may go back using
professional backdrops and this that
whatever I don't know but for me right
now I feel like literally I'm just
sitting on my bed
my camera is stuffed up on like a few
boxes and stuff and this is who I am and
this is what I like to create and I feel
like I will always kind of stay true to
myself like that and just sort of things
like this is me for role and when I blog
we're just showing you everything that I
possibly can be so open when I have
depression and stuff like that
because why not like I'm just a person
and I feel like you should with a
platform for people to watch people and
I am really scared if it's going to
become like a big whoop-de-doo TV
network and it's literature's going to
be like you're watching TV and then all
the independent creators I just push
down push down push down so much it like
wit they leave and we lose that reason
why we've watched YouTube in the first
place
it's just who shouts the loudest gets
the most attention this video is like
applying foundation with a condom or
just something ridiculous like that it's
like what is the most ridiculous loudest
thing that I can feel I don't know about
you but I really do miss the whole old
YouTube just the way the community used
to be I have seen and witnessed like all
kinds of flights and just things I
didn't want to be involved with in the
community and that slack and I backed
off a little bit but I still love makeup
like I still gonna do makeup girls when
I want sets like that because I didn't
just wake up one day and just just like
my girl look I never said that I just
said that things didn't sit well with me
that were happening in the community and
it just like I don't know and it's no
shade to anyone or anything like that I
just mean in general it's kind of felt
like high school in the popular crowd as
you move you are watching minute if you
want to keep seeing your favorite
youtubers create content and you don't
want them to quit I just suggest that
you know you do them things like have
your notifications on on their channels
you'll see it next to my subscribe
button there's like a little bell and if
you press that you'll actually get
notified when I upload and stuff like
that liking your favorite crows videos
like just giving them support because
without you we wouldn't be here and I'm
so grateful for each and every one of
you that have watched this video today
because you're the whole reason why this
is my job I couldn't be doing this
without you and I can't thank you enough
but I'll never be able to thank you
enough
just for watching my videos like it
means everything to me and it is just so
heartbreaking to think that maybe one
day we won't be here anymore because we
have all these forces going against us
that we which you can't make content
anymore I don't want to get to that
point you know I do we know that because
it is becoming a bit more commercial
everything that's why I love your jump
ship to watching people on
Chatham sent because it's live and it's
raw and you're watching people be people
I hope that you guys see exactly where
I'm coming from I'm not bashing YouTube
or bashing any kind of creator anything
like that I'm just talking very
generally about it all I'm just speaking
up because I feel that this is an issue
that's affecting a lot of people that
feel they're not being heard and I feel
the more that we talk about it the more
agreeing attention to it hopefully the
more that YouTube will actually look at
it and try to fix it because I love
YouTube and I just wish that it won't
lose its authenticity and what it is to
us because to me
YouTube has always been a place that I
can escape and watch these videos and
just feel so connected with people I've
never met before and I just hope that
that will always be there you know and
it's just the way that it's going is
quite scary looking like it's not going
to be that waste much longer but here's
some really good it will like I said I'm
not going to talk about it
I'm not scared if I get in trouble any
way shape or form for this video because
I'm someone who believes and standing up
for what I believe is right and I'm
standing out for people that need a
voice as well so that's why I want to
talk about a year and I swear to God I
really horribly fix the whole LGBT hue
thing because that broke my heart I just
couldn't believe what I was saying I was
like how in 2017 it's like is it coming
sis like how in YouTube restricting
people for being who they are but I just
have to get this off my chest and I hope
that it just informed a lot of you of
just what's happening messages that this
all gets sorted out soon because I want
to be making content for you guys for as
long as I possibly can because I love
you all so much and I love my job and I
just hope that if things will get better
eventually and in here for creators and
smaller channels will actually get the
recognition they deserve and people who
are just starting issue will actually
have a chance because everyone deserves
a chance and I just hope that this helps
you inform a lot of you that weren't
aware of it all and
yeah here's to it getting better let's
just hope and pray that things will get
