exciting I'm getting tattooed number
four and most likely the last area that
I'm gonna get for a long time not ever
but for a long time for sure just
something very small it's just gonna
mean a lot to me and of course I'm gonna
take you guys along with me and as you
can hear I am just recovering from a
cold right now and that's my voice is a
little bit like weirdly raspy time to
get a teeny tiny bit nervous about each
other it's in like 40 minutes I think so
I'm gonna be heading down this sec she
found my tattoo artist through Susie who
was hell October like all the tattoos
are done by G or Georgia I want to show
the right way I have to ask if she was G
or Georgia but I will leave her
Instagram here for you guys to have a
look at because she just has the most
amazing lime work I've ever seen like
it's so delicate and so fine which is
really what I wanted for this one but
this one ended up being really like
thick and bled a lot and I was really
disappointed with that so I'm going to
Georgina specifically because she does
very fine a line work but I'm super
excited I'm so sum it means a lot to me
something that I'm always gonna see
every single day for the rest of my life
so it is very exciting and I feel like
we need a little chart because it's
literally been the longest time I don't
have a quick little catch-up before I
run off and show you a few things that
I'm actually laughing because this top
has been stretched when I went skydiving
in Dubai which again I could not believe
that I actually went skydiving it's
insane I will actually include my
skydiving clips in a second for you guys
because it was all recorded someone
jumped out with me and filmed everything
for me they do that at Skydive device
that was really sick so I scarred I
would make and the whole time he was
just like why are you nervous
it's like I was in the plane like so
excited like I can't wait to jump out
and everyone in the plane is like white
with fear and I was not nervous one time
not a one time it was just something
I've always wanted to do and take off my
bucket list it's been like right the top
of my bucket list normal Mike the first
didn't quite get to see them when we
went to Finland so I'm just gonna have
to go back
skydiving was number two and that is
done now thank God so here are my
skydiving Club
how's the view how's everything so it
was a pretty amazing experience but I
don't think I'd ever do it again weirdly
enough like the one thing that people
always ask me tell would you do it again
but for me I really feel like it was a
one-time thing like I have done it now
so I struggled a little bit when we did
the freefall so as soon as you come out
the plane you may have seen my head was
too far thought it should been further
back but it really hurt to do that so in
turn actually hurt my neck a little bit
but the freefall bit I really did not
like because the whole body is like what
are you doing this isn't right like your
brain is fighting against it was
actually happening you were falling
through the sky like it just doesn't
seem right but the biggest issue for me
it was that obviously my videographer
god bless it was trying so hard she was
looking at me she said come on smile do
this do that and I was just there at one
point I thought I can't breathe I
literally can't breathe and everything
was just going so fast and like I was
falling and I was a legend my mouth
opened I was like and nothing was going
in so I started to like panic a little
bit I was like I can't breathe I can't
breathe I can't breathe so I probably
went a good like 20 seconds 30 seconds
or so without breathing properly so I
got really dizzy and really faint which
wasn't the greatest feeling ever so my
video at that point literally my skin is
just flapping against my face I never
realized I had so much excess skin
before it's insane um I was really
struggling so that part of the video
isn't really like great NYX or like
doing it's all thumbs up he's like yeah
like loving it I'm just let you see like
I'm struggling like I breathe I can't
breathe like it's crazy but then once
you and the freefall parachute goes up
it's just so much better the whole
paragliding Bay is my favorite bit I
would a hundred percent power of that
again but that freefall oh I just don't
like it and the coolest things cuz we
made Nick like jumped at the same time
he jumped up just after me that when we
were
regarding we actually ended up providing
all right next we tell like our
instructors made it so that we were like
right next to each other and it was like
a really really cool memory a really
cool experience so that was fantastic so
Dubai was really really fun it was the
first holiday that I haven't vlogged in
a year and a half so it's really nice to
me to just kind of have some like
relaxed time and chill time that's why
there is no do my blog let's get this
show on the road
let's get this tattoo done I'm getting a
little bit nervous now I'm more nervous
right now for a Tony like this big in my
arm that I was having so once I get the
tattoo and I'm home that's what I want
to explain the significance of it to you
just that you can see it and you can
actually picture wire but it and why I
got it in that certain place I thought
you guys haven't seen beans in ages but
she's just gonna have a good snow time
yeah I'm gonna get her a nice treat ooh
a nice treat yeah and you can stay in
your bed with a nice treat aren't you
lucky I made it I made it I made
hello hello hello hi and I've just done
a massive food shop so I'm just gonna
unpack that but I actually have to take
my tattoo in its dressing for a little
bit before I wash it and put coconut oil
on it so ji said that coconut oil fell
and the peñón which is something new to
me I always use the penvenen so I'll be
trying this coconut oil trick instead
but I'm just gonna unpack these bags I
also do a little bit of a cleave shop as
well and I have about I think I can hide
it if I do that I have like 10 million
things to open which I think I don't
camera with you guys and they ordered
some stuff from misguided at like 9:00
p.m. and arrive state midday that is
good service we're gonna open those PR
boxes together really quickly I'm going
to unpack the food and then we're gonna
finally watch the telly and we are going
to look at it together and I'll explain
its meaning it's all that stuff and I
also have a very needy pug at my feet
one look of loving affection no no
gorgeous Hey
the first time I ever saved a package
Fenty beauty well that's incredible
sticky tape sticky tapes oh my God look
at you I have a Fendi telmo's so this is
the this is the offensive beauty body
lava it just makes your body shine and
look fantastic
oh wow oh wait like myself and that
stuff next time I go out wishing you a
relaxing pampering session with our new
botanical soothing therapy hair care
that is really pretty that was so nice
like a nice relaxing bath after Matsui
cooled milk chocolate infused with
lavender YUM here is the little Becca
package I have only ever used champagne
pop before so it's very very very
exciting for me to have my hands on
hello me I can see me there like to get
my hands on some more backup products
okay so we have Prosecco pop and
champagne pop I've never tried Prosecco
pop myself then we have the primer and
then this one Hydra mist is a very odd
name because it's a powder I'm a little
bit confused
I'm excited to try it but I don't quite
get why that's called a mist Wow so on
the Left we have Prosecco pop as you can
see it is more gold on the right we have
good old champagne pop so this is a big
mixed bag of stuff from my management
for me in this one I'm so excited about
this is Lydia's makeup bag with
Elizabeth Arden like Lydia is filling it
my mom loves her like absolutely adores
Lydia which is all have vlogs as well so
she's gonna like one steal this from me
for sure this is such a cute little
makeup bag I love that has a mirror
as well it's so so so so handy then we
have these two which I have seen all
over the gram like look at that the one
on the right I'm just like calling my
name should we shake it one more time
let's do it oh that's so cool okay we
are in the bathroom is time to give it a
wash undress it and my instructions were
warm water you put a little bit clean
let it air-dry for half an hour and then
pop on some coconut oil not happenin I
am already lit come off whoops
I shouldn't realize how loose that was
so I'm just gonna pop off the dressing
oh my god it is so beautiful so delicate
I love it I am going to give this a wash
then I'll pop the oil on it and then
when it's all like clean in half an hour
I will do a grand review hey guys it has
been about half an hour so it's actually
this one studio time so she is hanging
around like a bad smell yes just
cleaning the tattoo I'm so so happy with
it like I cannot explain how talented
she is she her attention to detail
everything I keep looking at it I'm like
I've never seen lines this fine before
like I'm just so happy with it so you
guys know how on the back of my arm I
have a wave and that wave symbolizes the
up and downs that come with having a
mental illness we've been just the ups
and downs and life things have to crash
before they could subside and come and
look and stuff so that was the point
wave and the wave is placed behind my
arm because I want to think of that area
of my life as like behind me although
it's not I like to think of it in that
way the new tattoo is on the complete
opposite side it's parallel to it and it
says you can and we have written the
word and the font in a way of like a
wave as well this one is on the front my
arm because this is a positive message
to myself of you can't like you can do
anything you've got through it before
and you can do it again it signifies a
lot of different
things in my life if I ever have moments
where I feel like I literally can't do
it I want to give up I just don't think
I've got the strength or whatever I
looked down and it says you can so here
is I'm gonna go into the light so that
you can have a better look but I think
is so beautiful the line work is
absolutely incredible as you can see is
a little bit tender because it has only
just been done so I'm a little bit red a
little bit sore and I also have a fake
tan around it which doesn't look too
fantastic
it was know very dead here so I what
meaning I just can't get over the line
work though like it's just so fine it's
so beautiful so with my arms you can see
I've got the wave and then we have that
I love the placement of it as well like
I think the placement is absolutely
beautiful too very like strange to get
used to but as you can see like it it's
just so small so tiny but I'm very very
happy with it she did an absolutely
fantastic job so thank you so much I am
one happy customer
I was not happy having three tattoos I'm
like I need four I'm one of those people
that like these things upset me like I
need even numbers in my life and I need
things to be structured and I'm just a
bit crazy but there it is and it's gonna
be there forever and ever and ever so
thank you guys for watching this super
quick little vlog there will be another
video in just a few days this is just
like a bonus video but until next time
guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
