getting and now I shouldn't even get in
we've got a scoided and they kicked us
us the Train and it was eight it was 40
minutes like they meant to find our way
from East Croydon here so I didn't catch
the bus in time to train this 45 minutes
to wait my friends are on the other bus
I've been sitting around waiting because
I've booked another bus again later on
right before the break of day and I
never side you trying to think of
something to say you're gonna have to
leave someone so I'll give you this
harder part means I'm gonna miss you
every time because I can't get used to
letting you go
when the tears roll down your face okay
with a drama yeah
the Germans on munchies here it is so
cute yeah isn't it is like you have
unless you go to the markets yeah we're
never gonna get there but it's very very
very cute
noise so bad that you came back he's
already passed us by
but I know I can trust you even when I
can tell you're lying but I'm scared
heavy so the car is parked just outside
are you still coming with me along for
the ride because I can't get used to
letting you go

Bailey's a lot of loves it isn't it too
hot
yeah we can well we can get
pick your own way we can go today we can
be the world behind so honey let's go
let's do it we lost do all things we
dream up
[Laughter]
good morning Dini hello everyone I am
back home got home really late last
night picked up the dog now we are fresh
Monday morning I am going to the gym
today what the hell is happening here
I'm going to explain to you guys it's
got who I'm going so if you've been
following me for a while you would have
seen I had quite like a intense fitness
journey
this year and and last year actually and
was doing it more for like approval of
others more than anything else and it
just was really toxic for my mindset and
I got to a point where my eating was so
toxic how I would tell myself like I
wasn't allowed to eat until like later
on that day ate all my calories and all
its kind of stuff like it was just so
wrong and basically yeah it messed in my
head I got hits of body issues from it I
kept thinking I was bigger than I was I
said to myself I will never go back to
gym again unless I'm doing it for myself
and I finally feel like I've reached
that point now where I'm like I want to
go to gym for my mind and on my body I
think that is the main thing here like I
just don't want to get sucked into doing
it for Instagram lights and all that
kind of stuff and to actually do it for
myself I'm just gonna go to a gym I'm
gonna sign up I'm gonna go I'm gonna see
what I can do my body is gonna be so
weak compared to what it used to be
because I haven't been to gym properly
in about four or five months so a lot of
my muscles gone I just want to look at
this more and approach more in a way
like if I get any benefits from gym
that's fantastic but I don't want to go
with the sole purpose of like growing a
butt or there's all that whatever so
that's the goal today and I'm sure I'm
going to be dead tonight started reading
the secret and I'm already trying to
sort of work that book into my life I've
read maybe like a quarter of it and
that's kind of pushed me again to do
this today and to go out and to focus on
what I want out of life so that it can
come back to me and everything so I'm
just not supposed to give away the next
one onto my Instagram and
I am going to go to the post office and
I'm going to post the last giveaway to
the winner and then when it stops
raining we can go up for a walk
currently so I am just doing a another
giveaway I'm just setting up the photo
for it this will be live actually as
soon as you guys see this so this is my
current giveaway that I'm doing on my
Instagram there are 13 NYX lipsticks in
this lingerie bolt so good I've got four
to five smelted mattes Too Faced peach
palette to face love light and then I've
got this red skin care merry little
luxuries it has like all of their best
skin care in there as well so I thought
eyes lips highlight skincare what more
could you want
I have just made the post live so go on
to my instagram which is 2ne1 city
use the hashtag dynamo city giveaway and
you guys could win I'm in the car I've
made it this far let's do it okay so a
little update first gym I wanted to
check out it has no parking at all which
is an ideal thing them because I don't
really like walk a mile and the rain
into gym kind of need something has
carpark and it sucked because it was the
gym I really wanted to sign up at but
you have to pay to park anywhere near it
like a ridiculous amount of money and I
was like that'll put me off going so
much to this other gym that I'm at now
which is like a bit bigger more like a
leisure center leisure dojo and it's
just so old and outdated and it just
smelt weird and I was like oh it's just
not working out for me so I've just been
on Google to try and find if there's a
third gym anywhere near me there Islam
which is in another town it looks way
more like a proper weightlifting guys
bodybuilder kind of gym which is
intimidating as hell for me but I'm like
oh but from their photos their equipment
looks pretty good and I just thought mmm
I might going to see if they have
parking if they have nice facilities and
if they're not too expensive then maybe
I should do that because if you don't
like your environment when you're in the
gym you're just not going to go like
your body's gonna be like now
don't want to do it so yeah I don't know
what it was about that but it was just
like the average age there was about 60
which is not a bad thing but it kind of
says to me okay this is more of like a
kind of leisure center older people's
bit rundown gym which isn't really what
I'm looking for so I'm gonna find out
where the hell this random kind of
weightlifting gym it is which terrifies
me
oh my god hopefully it all works out
we'll see I did Jim I was talking to you
guys about it's an expensive um it is
such a bodybuilding gym though like
hectic warehouse kind of gym so walking
in there I was like oh hello I'm the
only girl and there's like 50 guys in
here just a little side note the girls
do these kind of gyms that's where the
hot boys hide there's a few what guys
hiding emails like oh crap next thing
you know I'll be wearing makeup to the
gym like hey boys I'm too predictable
seriously but yes I did
legs and I've left I was only there for
25 minutes to 30 minutes because I knew
that if I push it any more I wish you
couldn't walk tomorrow wouldn't be able
to walk tomorrow waiting there dude -
lots of 20 lunges back and forth oh they
did 80 lunges body weight then I did 12
reps of three sets of deadlift with to 5
kilo dumbbells then I did lunges on the
spot 12 reps 3 sets I tried to do this
flip lunch thing where you put your foot
on something and then you lunge and that
Bulgarian Swiss what so everybody was
like Danny no you're pushing it then I
went on one of the machines and I just
need my legs were like shaking
and I was like alright I'm pushing it a
little bit so I left after half an hour
because I knew that would be the best
thing to do so I'm gonna go back on
Wednesday and do upper body and abs I'll
go back on Friday and he legs again I'm
gonna try though three times a week
but at least now I can feel good for the
rest of the day it's like midday I've
gone to gym
other way I finally go to gym just makes
you want to eat healthier anyway so yes
hopefully I stick to it in my mind not
my body you know it does feel good
what's your in there you actually
working you like this is good I remember
this feeling it's nice so now I'm gonna
go to Tesco gonna do a healthy food shop
then I'm gonna post a giveaway pick up
some deliveries and catch you guys later
oops I've been thinking about getting
one for so long it's so expensive but I
was like screw it I'm just gonna do it
I'm being a healthy guy also got my
nutribullet oh yeah I'm home I'm home
okay what did I get I got some new pots
and pans I got my nutribullet my
retainer is currently cleaning itself
some hangers a cute little dog so I got
some strawberries even though they're
not really in season it's still really
good to have I also got some frozen
strawberries and raspberries this water
bottle which i think is pretty good with
a whole morning and afternoon being on
it I've got some snackage at rice cakes
and the best flavor in the world I got
some ginger nut biscuits for my tea and
then I've tried these much before
whenever straw good it is protein
flapjacks I thought if I want to have a
kind of like guilt-free snack they're
not too bad I got um sweet and salty
popcorn and last but not least the most
exciting thing some Tupperware
make a protein shake something I have
not had in a long time
oh wait take it out I was not all right
what flavor should I have today
here we go oh it's been so long it's so
good I can already feel like being dope
and I feel productive happy this is good
alrighty so for my lunch today I'm gonna
have a little bite of chicken cucumber
and tomatoes and then I'm gonna have a
big meal for dinner but this protein
shake is really filling me up so I'm
just gonna have this much for my lunch
and I'm gonna drink all this water as
well cuz a little it sure the thing is
working out like if I work out I don't
want to eat that afterwards so just
something a lot fresh easy dumb this one
is a little fogged up already
we're getting up a log chewer gonna walk
hey let's go
I am home now I just posted at the
giveaway it picked up some deliveries
