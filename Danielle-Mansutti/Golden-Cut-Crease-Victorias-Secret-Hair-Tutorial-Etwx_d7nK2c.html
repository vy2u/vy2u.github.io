in today's fear I'm doing this really
fun sort of like golden cut crease
smokey eye kind of thing and I'm also
doing a hetero this is sort of like
Victoria Secret Meets be cheaper code
this guy but it's really like back it's
really fun it's really relaxed and it's
really pretty so I feel like it suits
this makeup look very well so I'm gonna
do the eye shadow first and then get
into the hair tutorial so I will this
makeup look on the weekend just passed
and so many of you on instagram of dying
see tutorial so here it is I really hope
I don't disappoint and let's jump into
it today we are starting with the Born
This Way concealer by Too Faced in the
shade light I'm just going to Pat this
all over my eyelids to make sure that
they're super light and bright and ready
for eyeshadow and I'm going to apply
this eyeshadow called Blanc on the top
to make sure that everything is set and
ready to go starting first with this
beautiful shade called burnt orange mat
by anastasia beverly hills i use this as
my crease shade like i do every single
video and i'm just going to blend this
out in my crease as a transition shade
following on from that i'm now using the
shade called cocoa bear from makeup geek
and using a smaller brush i'm just using
this to darken up the crease and i will
be going in for a little bit of a cut
crease effect but you'll see how I
achieve that really sneekly with lots of
cheating later on and now I'm using a
fudge by anastasi Beverly Hills adding
this to my crease to darken it even more
I'm making the transition shade super
dark this time because it is more of a
cut crease and then I'm blending it out
with a big fluffy brush
now using the concealer once again it's
time to cheat so this is how I do my cut
creases I just conceal all the mess that
I've made and make it look like I know
what I'm doing so
you guys know my secret now so as you
can see I'm just cleaning up all of the
fallout and I'm also cleaning up where
my crease is to ensure that it's nice
and bright I'm ready for the glittery
eye shadow that we're going to put on
the top I have fallen in love the artist
cushaw diamond glow powder oh my
goodness it is so beautiful I'm using
the Too Faced glitter glue to firstly
put this on my eyes to make sure it will
stick and I mean damn how pretty is that
it is just so gorgeous I recently
started using the artists creature stuff
and it is so beautiful so as you can see
I'm just speeding up the process here
and applying it all over my lid and then
ending it at my crease where it meets
that dark transition shade
now using my newfound favorite eyeliner
this is by tarte cosmetics I believe
it's called the TARDIS eyeliner so it's
a liquid eyeliner on one side and a
pencil waterline kind of liner on the
other and it is so black and it's so
beautiful and I love it so much
again cheating by cleaning up with
concealer it'll help guys
using the burnt orange matte shade again
I'm just going to run this on my lower
lash line this time and going to be
meeting that with the fudge shade on a
smaller pencil brush I'm just using this
to blend out the lower lash line and
darken it up a little bit then using the
other end of the eyeliner I'm using this
to line my waterline and make sure that
it's all nice and dark and ready for
mascara so for my mascara today I'm
going to use the benefit roller lash
this is a golden oldie of mine as many
of you who watch my channel know I just
love this mascara the roller lash and
the better than sex mascara my opinion
of my two favorites I've never found
anything better to leave in the comments
what your favorite mascara is because
I'd love to know now adding some glam
lashes by ice-pile lashes I'm just going
to pop this onto my eyes and you can see
the difference it makes like shibam
hello so your other finish eyes this is
the eye shadow look complete I hope it
was easy enough to follow because it is
a little bit trickier than my normal
tutorials and you can see how much I
cheat to achieve it so there you go
moving on to the hair portion we're
going to go from left to right from my
thin little little hairs to this big
volume of hair which is achieved thanks
to foxy locks extensions as you know
I've been using them so much recently
and I love them so much so as you can
see I'm just grabbing a portion of my
hair and tying it up I'm super bummed
because all the footage didn't work from
the start as you can see this was the
process I did for everything so I'm
grabbing a weft with four clips for this
section and then clipping onto my hair
for the two sections below I did apply a
three clip weft and a two clip weft and
I've just been curling them so you can
see the process that I've done here I
did that on the bottom as well but got
down the SD card and it's cropped
files not happy journey so as you can
see like I was getting a facelift there
as well so I'm curling my hair and I'm
adding extensions as I go to create more
volume the extensions are the same
length of my hair but they just make it
look so much thicker and bouncy and full
it's so amazing then I'm going to type
this little beard looking thing yeah to
make sure that I'm not going to over
curl anything and grabbing this really
thin kind of part from the top of my
hair I was going to brush it out and
then continue to curl the top part so
whenever I do curl my hair these days I
do use my foxy locks extensions because
it just gives me so much more volume and
just makes it look so much better and
thicker and I love it so much and here
is the finished look it's like a
Victoria's Secret bombshell kind of hair
meets beachy boho waves like I love this
so much it's so pretty
thank you guys so much for watching
today I hope you enjoyed this tutorial
and I'll see you all next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
