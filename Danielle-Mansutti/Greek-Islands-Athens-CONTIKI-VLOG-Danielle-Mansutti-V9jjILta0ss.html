annoying because I was so excited for

that I've put on makeup in ages because
I want to try my myself feel a little
bit better but as you can see for my
face in my eyes like I'm not well and I
feel like really rubbish so I might not
appear too much in this blog and I'm

such a fun place and then just laid by
the pool and I'm feeling a little bit
Brown thank God
tonight we're gonna go and see the
nightlife because it's one of our last
nights on Kentucky
so I am leaving today I just wanted to
show you guys I actually got a real tan
while I was here how exciting is that
can't believe I managed to live out of
this for four weeks it's tiny oh my god
oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god
oh my god
to
I'm taking you home with me guys guess
who's finally back in Melbourne I got
back last night and I'm feeling a little
bit touch today but I've been pretty
good surprisingly I managed to film
today got two videos done and I can't
believe it because I'm like still really
really really tired okay so hopefully I
can get my camera to stay here there's
actually a few things that I wanted to
address about my Kentucky trip but I was
thinking about on the plane because you
guys are my friends and I want to be
completely honest with you because I've
had a lot of you tell me that you are
really keen to do a Kentucky trip and
yeah there's a few things I have to just
get out in the open to explain to you so
I feel really bad if I just pretend like
everything was amazing and didn't be
completely honest with you my Kentucky
trick was the London to Athens tour and
then had an eight-day Great Island
explorer ad on the top it cost me about
5,000 Australian dollars that's without
flights the London to Athens part of the
trip was three weeks and I would
recommend that to anyone you get fed
breakfast you get fed dinner you can
spend every night you have a tour guide
a permanent bus driver and basically you
are part of a group and it's really
really cool experience your tour guide
would probably have a lot of knowledge
about the places and all kind of stuff
so it's a really really really great
experience and definitely worth 3,000
it's really dollars I think that one is
I was incredibly disappointed by my
Greek islands trip all the footage that
I've shown you it looks incredible and
it was incredible because I made the
experience good for myself but I feel
and the general conversation of my whole
group was exactly the same we all feel
like we don't know where our money went
for the trip and I would definitely
recommend doing it alone as you'd save
so much money to be completely honest I
paid 1,500 fish for my week in the Greek
islands we had two days in an articled
Paris which was for some reason we were
taken to Paris instead of mechanize they
normally do Mykonos but we did Paris and
there wasn't really much there it was a
beautiful little
but do you really get much from that
experience there was no nightlife there
wasn't much of an atmosphere and the
whole island had a population of five or
six thousand so it was beautiful but it
wasn't what I had expected out of the
Greek islands and as soon as we arrived
our accommodation was a four share room
she paying pretty much 300 dollars a day
to say that and I didn't think that it
was worth the money at all and Paris was
okay it was beautiful and then we moved
on to Santorini and I had massive
expectations for Santorini I was so
excited for Santorini and everyone that
I've ever known that it's been there
with contiki has loved it so we arrived
in Santorini and Santorini is an island
which is kind of shaped like a moon I
guess and at the very top you have I
believe it's pronounced eeeh it's oh I a
and then in the middle you have zero
right or fear I never knew how to say it
and then the very very very very bottom
you have work and Diggy put you and
honest-to-god guys I was dumped in the
middle of a field with like cows and
stuff and just so far away from the town
cabs are expensive you just you have to
pay for your own transport everywhere
and it just wasn't what you wanted out
of Kentucky this was my view of
Santorini so as you can see not much of
a view right he literally dumped in the
middle of nowhere and I was so
disappointed I thought I'm paying so
much money to be here and they have the
most beautiful accommodation in
Santorini and we were so far away it
just kind of ruined the experience for
everyone it felt like we weren't even
there
um can take it off it absolutely no
options to go to Santorini unless you
paid the money and then they take you in
and also when you're on the Greek
islands trip there's absolutely no
breakfast included absolutely no dinner
included you pay for every single on
your meals you pay for transport
everywhere you pay for public buses they
don't offer any transport so basically
all you're paying for is hotels and
fairies fairies are normally twenty to
thirty euros and the hotel accommodation
that we looked online a four share was
an only 30-year as a nice so when you
add that all up for the week
you're like $1,500 doesn't really make
much sense and then we went to aisles
and I asked is like the party capital of
Greece we walked off the ferry and then
we were told we could walk to our hotel
because it's at the port now no one goes
to EOS to stay at the port EOS is sort
of like a Mexico Vegas five everyone was
saying and it just was such a
disappointment to find out that we were
staying in this like family motel in the
port and all these other tour companies
like top deck and stuff was staying in
the middle of this amazing beach club
place called far out and we were so very
way to get taxis everywhere and the
thing is I don't want to sound like such
a complainer I'm just trying to be
honest because I don't want you guys to
do this expecting something really
different from what it was and I didn't
show much of the accommodation and stuff
because I didn't want it to be like
coming off really rude but I just feel
now that I'm being honest so I'm not
trying to be rude whatsoever chicken
Tiki but I do feel that they need to
step up their game with the Greek
islands tour because it was a big
disappointment and every single person
on the group agreed that we were very
disappointed with a great island
experience however we all feel that
perhaps I have a voice that will
hopefully change it for you guys in the
future if you're considering doing the
Greek islands to just sort of change it
up also our tour guide was very very
unorganized he told someone in our group
that he didn't like the people in our
group and that to me is just so
unprofessional and he wasn't a very
approachable person but that's my
impression I got of him some other
people really loved him and I really
enjoyed him so I don't know that was my
experience and I want to be completely
honest about it but to be honest I don't
know where my money went and I really
want to consider asking them for a
refund because the amount of money I
spent on public transport and my own
food and net my own everything and to be
honestly too
go all the way across the world to
something like the Greek islands one of
the most beautiful places in the world
dumped in a farm where the shower
doesn't even work he got cold water and
you're sharing a room with four people
is bizarre and one of my friends I met
on the tour called Celia she went to the
far-out beach club where we would have
loved to stay she walked straight in
there asked how much a double room is
for the night it was ten years for the
night when we found out it was that
cheap to say some was so nice in the
middle of everything
we were so confused as to why can't he
he put us in such rubbish accommodation
and it just it just really ruined the
trip for us it just made the experience
the experience could have been so much
greater if we were put in a central area
we got to meet other travelers but we're
putting family motels and it just didn't
seem right it was really confusing when
we booked the tour all the accommodation
for the Greek islands was TBA if I had
$1,500 for that week I could have had
such an incredible week spending $1,500
but instead I paid that much money I
really didn't get anything back for it I
just think that I'd like to be honest
about that and I'm sorry if I've tried
this on a little bit too far I just feel
like it's very important for me to be
honest you know I'm not being paid by
Kentucky I'm not sponsored by them I can
say whatever I want I paid for my own
trip it's really hard like I was so
honest and all these vlogs about my
experience so I really hope that you
guys appreciate that I hope that you
enjoyed my Kentucky bugs as well because
I'm so glad I did it I'm so glad that I
told everyone hey like this is what I do
I'm kind of shy but I love filming and
I'm everyone and people didn't seem to
mind too much like I don't think they
did um but I'm so glad that I can look
back on all my vlogs and you guys seem
to really like as well and I'm in love
