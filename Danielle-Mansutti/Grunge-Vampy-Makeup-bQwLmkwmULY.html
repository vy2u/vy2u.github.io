today I've done something completely
different so much fun to go miss kind of
videos and just go like so artistic and
just different and I love it I love the
way it turned out I know it's not very
wearable look that's for show but it
definitely is a really really really
cool I really hope you guys enjoyed this
kind of tutorial and let's jump straight
into it
hi guys talk to us complete in my face I
did my foundation and my bro you guys
just see me do it a million in one time
so I thought you know what save you from
skipping her at this time I'm just not
going to include it if you don't want to
see what foundation and brass stuff I
use check any other of my videos and
you'll find it I promise this page so
many Christmas look slightly that I'm
just kind of like let's dock and
everything I'm a little bit I have a
whole bunch of my a nostalgia belt in
heels and makeup pick single shadows in
here and I'm aiming to do
so like a warm black kind of eye and I'm
going to do black lips for the first
time so we're gonna begin it by using
the soft ochre Paint Pot by Mac Mac and
as you guys most likely know I like
never as I use my little like eyeshadow
base primer whatever on my lips because
I've always felt like it didn't really
do anything for me but I want to see
today if I feel like it makes any
difference in whatsoever so for my
crease I'm going to use this makeup geek
shudder it called creme Brule
so with creme Brule I'm just going to
hit my crease for now I'm just going to
pack it on first and then start blending
it through
I'm now going to pick on this shade
called henna by Anasazi of other hills
I'm going to just place this in my attic
Alanis now
and then I'm just going to blend it
towards my inner corner when the brush
is mostly clean and all the accesses
come off and this is just to ensure that
we get a little bit of gradient and then
we can't see where the eye shadow starts
and finishes
now I'm taking corrupt by makeup geek
and I'm gonna use this with an eyeliner
brush and I'm going to attempt to do
eyeliner with a black eyeshadow and I've
never done this before so let's do it on
camera and just make an absolute mess
happens
actually I'm gonna munch out the awesome
this way it's for a really nice effect
I'm taking a liquid eyeliner I'm just
going to go over that smudgy mark just
to ensure we have a straight line as
well now going to line the waterline
underneath my eye and also tight line at
the top I'm not grabbing Coco bear and
going to egg to sort of put this in my
crease again I don't think I like to it
overboard but I just want to make it all
a bit browner
I'm just in the I'm using the black
eyeshadow kurupt once again and I'm
going to very very very tightly put this
in my lower lash line it's close to lash
line as possible I'm also going to apply
it very lightly to add a crease and just
sort of make the cinema as a hot
unblended messes it's time to bring
everything together I'm going to grab a
big fat blending brush
now grabbing cocoa bear once again and
adding this back into my crease just to
provide more warmth again see totally
lost it and all that black Viper
eyeshadow I'm taking this shade called
grandstand by a makeup geek and I'm just
leaves my little finger to pop this into
my inner corner
so the eyes are done I'm sitting on some
mascara I'm using it be a Too Faced
better than sex mascara
I thought done it's time to move on to
our contour Safari browsers today I'm
using the NARS Laguna bronzer and this
means a big fat let I mean black fluffy
brush and I'm going to go quite intense
sweeping my contoured steaks I feel like
this is such a dramatic look that I made
so I'll just go crazy yeah
and also are going to step it on my
forehead and down Watchmen and over the
top of that I'm just going to dust a
little bit of my max I'll deposit just
for a bit of shimmer about Jimmy
Jimmy
and surprise surprise releasing
made brought by Jackman he'll as a
highlight as well
and I'm running a little bit of a nice
now it's time for the really fun part
I'm using at midnight by Anastacio
Beverly Hills on my lips it's the best
on my whole life and run black lipstick
so this would be really cool like really
like at the end of the day it's makeup
guys you can just wash it off if it
looks bad I'm sure it'll look really fun
good
