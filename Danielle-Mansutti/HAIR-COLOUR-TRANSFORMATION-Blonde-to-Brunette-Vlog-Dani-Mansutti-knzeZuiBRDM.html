early right now that it's still like
dark outside
I'm out to head to London and I'm going
to get my hair dyed I miss you so
excited the day is finally here I've
been umming and ahhing about dyeing my
hair for so long it's currently so
greasy and I just wish I have it on it
but I'm gonna head to London I'm gonna
get done at Daniel Galvan itself adjusts
itself which is Selfridges today what do
you think beanie you're not gonna
recognize me are you and I am just so
excited to see exactly how my hair is
gonna look ever since I did the whole
like black wig on Instagram and on my
fall makeup short which I'll leave a
card for for you guys I've just been
like it converted me and I'm like I need
to do this I'm so over this hair it's so
like limp and dead and I hate the color
I haven't been happy with the color ever
since I've got it done in Australia but
what we can I just hated the colors it
came so today we're gonna fix it and
we're gonna get brand new in so like
literally this is gonna be such a big
thing for me cause like I feel like my
hair is so much like my identity gonna
be like I'm so precious about my hair so
fingers crossed it all works out
let's hope so and they still calm and
very ready I leave myself so much time
and then I'm like oh my god it's my joy
every single time anyway I'm on my way
early in the morning right before the
break of day lying beside you trying to
think of something the same these
freshmen adorable and one brunette color
because they said
my head got really taken momentum David
I'm in the sink
we're doing something
it's basically just going to like heal
my hair a little bit
we'll be coloring my hair bit like
orange fries
like a dog
it was a green you know like a crime
like
fabulous with this battery cream on my
head
a minute people orange and everything
and there will be one actually doing
it's currently like a fiery red it won't
be like this too often for a moment I
was like look at that okay now I think
after this is banana
another one of this
there's a long process but it's gonna be
worth
make a publisher like
bang-won
hey guys I'm back home now this is so
weird
I literally just like can't get used to
this hair like it's honestly the
weirdest thing like every time I look in
the mirror I'm just like and the color
is obviously quite dog it will actually
fade into like a lighter brown color
blonde I like to brunette over time but
I thought I'd show you guys when I got
home what it look like because my run
out of the hair dress is half my makeup
was washed off so we realized why do I
even bother putting on makeup I don't
understand so I just got ready because
I'm actually going on a date tonight
I was also super excited to see how like
my makeups gonna look with this color
hair and everything and it's just it's
weird to me I feel like I have to
relearn everything and relearn like what
colors to put on my face because I just
feel like so do for it it's weird it's
just like the smallest the smallest
change but like it's just hair but like
I just feel different this anyway I can
like describe I feel really different
with it but I do really like it I think
my hair looks so much healthier we cut
off like two inches as well yet it still
is looking like really long because dark
hair looks longer anyway but I am like
so excited to hear what you guys think
as well because I do really like it and
also my experience oh my god the salon
it was beyond incredible like honestly
the best customer service I think I've
ever had in a hair salon like so good I
have like menus you could get like
cocktails and smoothies and food and
everything it was so good so if you're
from the UK definitely suggest going to
Selfridges and checking them out but for
me now I'm just gonna finish and get
ready if you do want to see what I'm
wearing I'll show you quickly you'll
need to put shoes on at some point oh I
get used to me with like this little
hair so weird looking slightly weird
with dark hair might wear dark she's
actually too much the dark hair but
honestly it's just weird like getting
these two completely different hair
color after such a long time but let me
know what you guys think as well I would
love to hear your feedback and your
thoughts on the hair color I am actually
like yeah really growing to love it now
so let's chat in the comments and I'll
see you guys next time bye that was a
really weird bye
let's try that again bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
