because this week is absolutely insanely
exciting so I got to go and get my hair
dyed as we can see it's gone very light
the kind of orangie and very dead so I
need to get quite a bit chopped off and
thinking just like a little bit darker
in the sense of just kind of evening it
out getting rid of all that I want some
orange yes and it is perfect timing that
I'm going to do it because more I am
most likely I say most lucky because I
don't have my flights here but I'm most
likely going to Venice going to an
amazing event there and most likely
meeting Cara Delevingne what the hell
it's just like oh it's such an exciting
week and tonight I'm actually grabbing
dinner with Susy who is hello October
love you may be following her as well
so excited to see how we're gonna get
pizza so I'm just like living right now
I am just gonna put my bag jump on the
train and then head to Daniel Galvan
which isn't Selfridges that's where I
get my hair done they just work absolute
wonders on hair like they are so so so
so good if you're ever in London and get
a chance to pop by it is so worth it so
it's time to get this change have a good
London and I'm gonna watch the crown on
the train excellent
I'm sick about this
see you later and tada we have healthy
shiny darker hair just like that so it
is actually the next day right now I let
you just packed my heart out for but
since I finally got my flights confirmed
last night turning over my job I don't
find out things that I'm doing until
literally like a few hours beforehand

have two meetings it's literally gonna
be the craziest day I've got to take my
suitcase with me jump on Trevor Bryan to
London and I'm literally gonna be
walking around London with my suitcase
going to my first two meetings and then
by the time that my meeting the second
meeting finishes my flight is in like
two hours after that finishes so I have
to run on the train go to Gatwick I just
I don't know how I'm gonna manage to do
it but there will be somewhere that this
can be done so I'm just finishing out my
packing now and then off to today's
meeting so I'll show you a quick little
overview of what I've packed I have
packed so alike
mainly because well I'll tell you now
because it's not confirmed this whole
event is for footlocker and pure
I said Puma I know in America they say
Puma by CP so it's not like a makeup
kind of fashion about anything so for me
I've been a little bit like what do I
wear because I know what to wear it like
makeup event so i'd like pied it really
safe i have some kind of like smart
casual options to take with me but I
didn't think dressing heel suits for
look at Puma event and cara delevingne
is gonna be there so I was slightly
freaking out a little bit but I am so
excited this experience like oh my god I
am just about packed I have a tiny
little suitcase to take with me so
tomorrow's outfit I might even wear that
today cuz it's a little bit chilly

last year of my school which is the
equivalent College in the UK I like was
just in love obsessed with drawing car
alert she's always been like that one
girl that I'm always like she's girls so
yeah I used to draw her a lot instead so
so so so weird
it's crazy worlds colliding and actually
Venice like northern Italy is very close
to kind of like where Mansell D is from
the people up here have like a similar
dialect to the time that my dad speaks
I'm really sure so everything just seems
kind of familiar it's nice

energy sure but I'm very excited to see
it we have arrived
