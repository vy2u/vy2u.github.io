in today's year we're talking all about
health and fitness
because clearly over the past few weeks
I have eaten like whatever I wanted and
then I was like how come I have no
energy how come I feel like crap how
come I'm always bloated how come I just
feel rubbish and I was like well I know
why because I'm not being healthy right
now this week I had a health kick and I
asked you guys if you were interested in
knowing or what I do during my health
kick that I would document for you and
that is what I have done it basically
the first thing I want to tell you
literally you would hear every single
dose of every single person the solution
to every single one of life's problems
is drinking water
only true I drink so much water mouth it
will actually make such a massive
difference yes for your skin for your
energy everything and a lot of the time
you are actually thirsty not hungry and
sometimes I forget that I might be
snacking on my chocolate and thinking
one really hungry but I'm actually just
super since dude I don't order do it I
make sure of course that I'm drinking
lots of water and also drinking stuff
like green tea or tea or whatever um
personally I don't drink coffee makes me
feel like so jittery action so I can't
do that but I enjoy drinking tea it
comes me down and that's also a lot of
my intake of water as well
secondly it is your food so it comes to
my health kick weeks I'm not doing a
health pick in order to lose weight or
anything like that I'm doing it in order
to feel more energy because now that I
go to gym and stuff I've learned a lot
about macros and calories and stuff I
take that into consideration on my
health week just because I know how it
makes my mind feel as well so I have not
been counting calories this week at all
but I have been checking my macros and
your macros are your fats carbohydrates
and proteins
basically what that means is that I'm
getting enough energy is my body enough
fuel into my body because I am working
out as well because I'm working out I'm
training and weight lifting I need to
ensure that I am fueling my body the
correct way because there's nothing
worse than
wasting toilet gym and not getting any
getting from it I went shopping and I
got lots of stuff like salads and fruit
some meats and all that kind of stuff
and that's what I've been eating this
week because I'm trying my best not eat
anything else a packet this week to try
to eat stuff which is real
I just stress around the party style and
I didn't leave got some fool rooms
because they're in season here and I
mean amazing then I thought these are no
Charlie's before these are bins
multi-speed flatbreads I just want
something crunchy they look pretty good
I've got too many carrots just so
crunching on because I crave crimes we
had I crave textures more than food
it's just now weird I got some plums cuz
they're in season I got some enteries
fun fact about me I'm like obsessed with
pinch me don't know why I like a really
good everyone's eye just so good so I do
have other stuff my fridge I'll show you
what I've got
I'll show you what I got for my chest
got delivery of the day but this is like
10 pounds just under movie well it's my
fridge and show you what's in there so
here's a look inside my fridge at the
moment I remember I am a very dear girls
with love themselves so this is a lot of
food because unfortunate when it comes
to buying fresher to me like I have to
eat it when I buy it because I'll just
let go off because I can't get through
this much food in like a day obviously
obviously so let's start here I can
ignore that okay my Domino's Pizza other
day haha ok I think this one's once
opens I've got a bunch of almond milk
with my tester delivery they didn't send
me the right one which is the roasted
almond on Fringe this is the first I've
ever tried unroasted it's quite unusual
now I've grieving sighs not much I can
do about it
yes a couple sources currently obsessed
with pickled onions I don't understand
why they're just like amazing and I'm
obsessed with everything vinegary then
I've just got some roast chicken slices
the entropy Jakarta saw I have a meal in
one sitting there doesn't get there
wasn't spicy prawn spaghetti
I'm currently obsessed with honey rice
ham can't believe how good it is for you
like it's literally again it's kind of
home salt but who cares about that like
seriously it's so high in protein it's
like incredible I had no it was sort of
you and I have two turrets estaci√≥n
cucumber cherry tomatoes salad then we
have a bunch of great
strawberries and we have my yogurts and
two eggs at the back we have squeaky
beam as well what I've discovered is
increasing the volume on my plate of
good food fills me up longer a story for
instance if I want to have chicken I'll
have a chicken salad on which you like
fill my plate with colors and then add a
chicken and normally I can't finish it
because it's just so much food when it
comes to my food for breakfast I'll
normally have something like yogurt and
granola or porridge or even like smoked
salmon on toast or tuna on toast or
something like that something which I
know isn't food sugar it's going to fill
me up and it's good for me because
normally I'm eating like sugary kids
cereal systems is global or I have like
the chocolate granola stuff which
basically is and really good for you
whatsoever but I'm like and because
breakfast is your most important meal of
the day I want to make sure that I'm
feeling myself with lots of things that
someone is remain have yogurt granola
and then have porridge as well it
totally depends on my mood I'm training
all that kind of stuff so lunch I
normally have something kind of like a
deli plate I guess you'd say with like I
have like sliced meats like hand salami
stuff like that I like to bite people
done ioan salad that might have like a
ham sandwich or like salad and ham
whatever and then when it comes time
like to increase my carbs a lot so
normally something like lots and lots
lots of brown rice chicken or even like
pasta or something like that so
basically all the food that I'm eating
is like proper food if you have a dog it
is vital to walk them everyday as I'm
sure you know but during a health kick
week month life whatever you want to do
make sure you walk them every single day
as soon as you wake up get it completely
under way and your dog will be in a much
better mood throughout the whole day as
well so I make sure to walk bean the
minute I woke up I plant some clothes
Walker and then for the rest of the day
she's like chill and happy and content
and it also gets you moving it's totally
a choice if you want to do fasted cardio
and walk before your breakfast
personally I'm the kind of person that
needs to eat as soon as they work out so
I actually eat might
before the walk because otherwise I had
like zero energy so I like to do that
and then I'll come home relax a little
bit make sure I drink about two four
glasses of water and then I pull myself
and get ready for June at the moment I'm
going to gym three times a week I am
doing legs twice and upper body at once
so the thing is with my gym
it is so overcrowded it's ridiculous
like it is so overcrowded so I'm filming
in there's a little bit like hard I got
a bit generator didn't really know what
to film so I filmed a little bit of my
upper body workout the other day I
basically just like a dumbbell only
being and I also used like the lat
pulldown on the road and all that kind
of stuff can do a video on upper body
workout if that's something you'd like
to see but I do find that working out
motivates me a lot more to be healthier
so I found that on my week when I eat
better I perform so much better it
seemed like I can get through so many
sets that I could on like the sugar and
chicken it is so good leaving gym after
having a good workout because over the
last two weeks I've left gym feeling
like well that was a waste of time I
feel like rubbish I couldn't even do
anything and it's because I wasn't
fueling my body with the right stuff so
now that I am I'm fighting like the
biggest difference in the world when it
comes to working out I'm sure like if
you're a runner or you enjoy cardio
which I don't I'm sure the same thing
like feeling your body with the right
stuff to be able to go further and all
that kind of stuff the next thing that I
like to advise is Rp had a pretty
horrible week in terms of your health
and what you fuel your body with don't
feel guilty just move on from it like
don't beat yourself up about it tell me
the ice due to so much I used to really
really punish myself on a date like
badly consistently for weeks on end move
on we'll just start your healthy journey
and be done with it I get withdrawals
every single time that I do this every
single time on the first day the first
night first day is the hardest I get the
most intense headaches from not having
sugar
and I guess cranking through Diaz also I
got like push through that and then just
stop feeling guilty stop hating on
myself oh it's currently 703 and the
cravings have begun like really hard to
the point of having like headaches I'm
craving chocolate or sweets or biscuits
or just like whatever so badly going
into a henna baby into a little bit of a
withdrawal phase right now
um I which didn't like scratch I'm just
like creating so hard but I told myself
today just today no treats because I
literally made myself sick by how much
sugar I had yesterday and I have lots of
healthy things to eat in the house I
don't have to go and eat or go outside
to buy chocolate tomorrow obviously from
tomorrow so eating chocolate again and
stuff like everything in moderation but
today I really shouldn't because I just
yeah oh my god it was just a whole how
much I had yesterday very like irritated
headachy angry because I girl who needs
a chocolate is on the first day serious
but I'm not going to let myself I think
this is actually going to be the best
debating that I've ever done in my life
I always give in I always have
rubbish ruse but I need to do this for
myself I need to do this for my mind I
know if I have chocolate I'll snap back
into feeling rubbish and low-energy
again so I'm going to get through it
wish me look good and it's also a
perfect time to give yourself some
self-love so make sure that you've had
yourself give me some face masks have a
nice bar read a nice book all that kind
of stuff like just do something for
yourself because
it's a waste of time punishing yourself
like you're already doing the best thing
you possibly can by choosing to eat
healthier food so you don't need to
punish yourself you're boarding made a
good decision
and the verdict from me after almost a
week now of healthy eating instantly saw
my body changing as well and feeling so
much more energized so much healthier
there are times obviously where I crave
sugar and I am NOT like not eating sugar
or anything I still have like a Terry
Baker at night or chocolate at night or
something I think everything is fine in
moderation and that's why the leave-in
otherwise I would literally go out
saying so it's not like I'm just eating
like constant rabbit food I allow myself
a treat every single day because I need
to I need to do that because otherwise I
would love to actually like buy
someone's head off of me so angry good
friends want to go out for lunch I've
got lunch with them I won't feel guilty
about it I won't dissect the menu or
anything because 90% of the time I know
that I'm feeling my body with the right
stuff the other 10% it doesn't matter
and I don't weigh myself I've never
bought scales because I think weighing
yourself is like I don't want to do it
personally I don't think white matters I
think it matters what you look in the
mirror and you see personally I would
have put on like 5 kilos at least from
gyms over last year I even know like
when I get to bed like I feel heavier my
hums are a bit like heavier and my legs
are a bit heavier so weight means
nothing to me but looking in the mirror
I can see that like I've lost a little
bit away and I'm not like a full and
bloated and everything because I was so
bloated when I started this and it's
been like five days I'm a difference is
just insane I'd rather just like stick
to this and like every now that's a
treat because I feel charged more
energized to normal and it's awesome and
