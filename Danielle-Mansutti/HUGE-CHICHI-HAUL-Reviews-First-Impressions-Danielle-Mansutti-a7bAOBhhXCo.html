channel today is a chichi haul and for
you guys who follow me on instagram you
would have seen the ridiculous
oh joy that I had spoon up so this is my
first full video but I just really
wanted to say these were sent me to
review and to try out in my videos I'm
not sponsored by them or anything like
this but yeah I'm so happy it was like
Christmas for me yesterday when I open
up the box I was like fully good like
one of the founders of Chi Chi over
email and they love pugs ah I love you
guys so much and they are from Melbourne
they do not test on animals big thing
because like I know that we all use
products which are tested on off but we
don't really know
in fact the thing I was so proud of how
they don't I love it and they're sort of
slogan is only tested on friends and
family I think that is awesome
I have eyes lips face eyebrows body
nails
check is on the floor next week and
first of all I'm gonna start with eyes
today I have created this look with this
palette this is the Smoky's palette from
chichi and I use a variety of different
blacks and grays to create the look on
my face today there is a tutorial coming
soon stay tuned there's also the bronzes
palette which has got lots of sort of
warm tones maybe so good for up on
smoking I think that's gonna be a new
video coming up also have received the
classics palette and it's lots of
different mats and shimmery ones I'm
going to show you quickly while I run
through this how pigmented these colors
are it is so awesome if I just put my
finger on a tiny bit like that you can
already see how pigmented it is so it's
awesome it's really easy to apply even
the light colors are really pigmented so
thumbs up for me the rich gems palette a
very very very bright colourful palette
and I am hopefully gonna use this one
for sort of like a peacock look I don't
know if you guys are like that something
that I want to try for myself so we will
see next we have got the brights palette
I'll probably combine the brights
palette and the rich gems great tutorial
coming stirring something very fun and
colorful I think they would work so
perfectly together and finally we have
got the sultry and also the bases and I
think the bases on is such a good idea
because it's just sort of when you don't
have like a natural look I think will be
so perfect and the sultry look is very
elegant and very sort of sexy so we'll
see how that goes and these aren't my
palettes I do already iron the nudes and
the Oasis so now that I have them all
I'm going to make them so many tourists
for you guys you have no idea I don't
want this video to be too long so I'm
gonna try and run through everything as
quick as I can for you guys I've always
sort of thought of holes is sort of like
a big showing off like oh my God look
what I bought saying don't wanna come
across that way I wanted to show you and
review a lot of products and just say
this is what they have in their range
it's so cool so please don't think I'm
trying to show up right now that I
really don't want it to come across
well I'm just showing you different
products that change he has okay let's
get that out of the way so I'm scared
were like you guys judging me and stuff
so we have eyelashes next we have got a
variety of different ones these are
called the super lashes they're also the
power lashes which are so beautiful I
have got the bat lashes and they are
quite thin but I've never actually worn
lashes like this before so sweet look
interesting to have a look at those we
have got the cat lashes it's very
traumatic sort of winged cat eye I think
it's so like yeah because I've never you
guys but because I am still a bit of a
makeup virgin
I always just buy the same eyelashes oh
it's great to have such a variety these
are just like your natural every day
thank you
these are so dramatic and crazy these
are the Bionic lashes and then we also
have the Wonder lashes which are the
individual ones so I'll be going through
those lashes and a few tours to come so
you guys can see how they look on my
eyelids next we have got the teaching
style eyeliners they are mostly blues
and greens and sort of metallic eye
colors and I will give you a bit of a
show-and-tell to show you how they are
with pigmentation just gonna do a line
on my arm and you see it is so creamy I
can't even deal expungeable yeah there's
multiple ticking all the boxes you guys
oh yes so these are super creamy these
are deep staying islanders their long
wearing waterproof smudge proof paraben
free and talc free high test is a
high-intensity penguins built-in
sharpener oh that's what the egg was
this is oh oh that's so good
so this is a built-in pencil shop
another thing oh my god I thought I
broke it thanks techsmartt Wow
okay so that is these they have a lot of
different varieties of colors I'm not
gonna swatch them all because you will
fall asleep and be so bored we have got
the metallic Islanders these are
absolutely beautiful they are so cute
and girly packaging I think they are so
sorry they're made in Italy just like my
family
these ones are more of a pencil they
super creamy again very bright you guys
can't see on the camera because my Lots
washing it out but I think the best part
about these is they do not drag on your
skin there is nothing worse and um drags
down your skin it's so bad for your eyes
next in the eye range we have got the
double-ended
I brighten up and it says get bigger
brighter looking eyes and two quick
steps so what it actually is is that you
use each side of the pencil on the wart
on the on your waterline and it gives
the appearance that you are wide awake
and everything I would show you but I'm
wearing a smoky eye it's like the
opposite to what this is next is the
eyebrows section and I have used each
one of these pencils in my eyebrows
today I used the blonde from my inner
part than I use it the light brown and
medium brown so that's why a little bit
of a sort of gradient going one of my
over us today I think what's so good
about these is that they have got a
little bit of like almost like a
spooling you're like an eyebrow brush
attached to it which is just perfect so
you have to take two different rushes
and now we're moving on to the loop
section and what I'm wearing on my lips
at the moment is the TG creamy matte
blue liquid liquid in the lipstick and I
am in love with it I love this color on
my lips because I hate pinky nudes I'm
more of a brown nude girl so I think
this is the perfect thing for me I'm
going to get so much use out of this one
this is called maneater I don't know the
box because I've already opened it that
was many eater the one I love is called
calendar girl we also have sexy lady leg
in red shirt stuff ah and ba-ba-boom
beautiful packaging I mean I can't get
enough of
that package tonight look so stunning I
love the colors the boldness
I love the font I love the side of the
boxes and I love just everything about
the packaging actually the packaging is
so beautiful no bad words are all about
the packaging as you guys know that I'm
not a fan of the chichi fonts but that
was funny
I still feel really bad for saying that
I am a foodie hope to see you get some
sort of idea they have served the soup
super wet when you open them up um and
they are like so ridiculously creamy and
you get so much out of it
like I'm gonna smudge this working out
with my thumb like how weird is that I
was like the tiniest bit that I put on
as oh then we have the matte lipsticks a
variety of different purples nudes pinks
oranges and reds I'm not going to go
through all of these yet I'm just going
to swatch one of them just to show you
how they look on my hand this is the
color called turn me on is a beautiful
dark purple color and I will just show
you what it looks fine
next we have got the lip liners and I'm
wearing it when it's 20 that's why I
don't have non-existent lips today I
have got quite a variety of different
lip liners today I've put on the
turtling nude color and when you put
them on your hand they are like so
creamy and they do not drag and next in
the hall we have got the fragrances and
I wish we had some kind of smell video
for you guys because I told them that I
would go into target and Maya which is
who sells them in Australia and I would
always go up to the TT aisle and spray
this on myself is the page of mango
fragrance and it is absolutely heavenly
I think it is so oh you guys cancel
every secret smell could always be like
a room spray as well because it is so
strong it's so fruity and sweet I
actually love it I hate
perfumes which smell like of women you
know anything so the packaging that it
comes in is these beautiful boxes I
think that the packaging designer for
chichi has a really good drum Rob job
with the packaging of these and I think
they're absolutely stunning
I love the pad like the patterns on the
side and I love the bottle it's a glass
bottle it's very beautiful as gradient
going through it and I just love it
so big thumbs up to the package designer
at Tucci and it's actually notes she she
apparently but I can't pronounce it they
keep saying to Jesus sorry
next we are going onto the face products
and first of all I have got the super BB
cream with caviar extract and coal guard
promotes collagen synthesis anti-aging
and ultra mantra mama moisturizing so as
you can see it was a BB cream here just
gonna rub that in funny thing I don't
even know why I'm doing this to be
honest because you can't even see it on
the camera but it is very very creamy
it's color correcting and it is so play
or liquidy it has SPF 30 in the BB cream
so you can wear it just on a normal
natural don't out and you are protected
from the harsh sun oil-free top free
free it's free preservative free it is
just a little foundation it's in a
powder form so great thing you girls who
just want a very light coverage the
packaging again is like the teaching
fabulous and flawless foundation which
I've done a review on it's got the
really pretty girly handwriting on the
side and then it just has the big
cheating point which I hope food
comments about before next we had the
bronzers the bronzer comes in this
really cute packaging it's like shiny I
don't know if you can see how it keeps
changing it's like super shiny and it
says choose cutie on the sides so cute
beautiful you're open it up you have a
mirror and you have got to be bronzer
and I use the bronzer today so the color
is like this I yeah put this on my skin
today just try it out and I having
it's not as harsh as my other bronzer
which is good because my other bronze I
was a bitch - no Dorito colors my next
thing to show you today is the nail
polishes that Gigi has these are the
salon formula chichi their topic
favorites nail set so they are very
bright and fluorescent they are so cute
I have not tried them on yet but I will
be doing a nail video if you guys soon
it's showing you they look like I've
also received these beautiful ones the
bubblegum pop confetti set they have
massive colors together and they got so
like fun and playful and I wish I could
wear nail polish more but I'm a nail
biters hurt unfortunately I put nail
polish on in two seconds later it is
gone I've got a group of Purple's pink I
have actually tried this one on my nails
and it is a very beautiful girl color
drives pretty quickly it dried probably
like 10 minutes of just kind of sitting
around like this and finally they dried
so it didn't take too long and finally
we have got the tanning range from
tuti's so as you guys know I am a bit of
a lover of fake tan if I haven't done
any videos yet relating to fake time
whatsoever so I'm very open to showing
you guys how these look please let me
know in the comments if you do want to
see it because I'm relying on you guys
for your feedback because if you don't
want to see it there's no point of me
filming it obviously so this is the
mediums dark solarium in a can and I
love that name great idea today I'm
gonna can instant body one instant
bronzer and self tanning spray for face
and body this one has got a nozzle as
has this one I think this one is the
same the sorry these ones are the same
packaging is like to me it is something
so fun but it's kind of an American II
90s 80s like really just fun I know that
it's not super modern but I really like
it because it's really different and
it's just
like neon lights and poor oh happy times
good stuff so for this one it says this
is the perfect way to achieve a healthy
sunkissed glow without the nasty side
effects of the sun's harsh rays or the
costly boredom of lying on a hot bed
looking like a Sun worshiping a
Mediterranean Queen it's easy as
one-two-three you have to exfoliate and
then you apply this it doesn't stain
your skin or close it washes up with
soap and water so it is a wash off ten
great three keys going out one day we
can't be bothered like having a full-on
ten same as these bottles but in a myth
so it doesn't have a nozzle it has got
just a spray I think it's just for
touch-ups and stuff like that so that is
my first haul and it is probably gonna
be the best thing I've ever received in
my life
overwhelmed by the generosity of this
company they are so lovely and I want to
think big THANK YOU then once again so
excited because now I have got so many
more opportunities for tutorials and I
was always a bit worried because I don't
know if you guys know I haven't really
got that much pink up until yesterday
obviously so I was always a bit worried
about tutorials because my makeup that I
had wasn't like all these other girls
like Nonna's macking I like to face and
Nas and the dye stain already on a nerve
always a bit worried because I thought
you know I don't have that kind of stuff
to show you I wish I could play around
that kind of makeup but not everyone can
afford it what I think is so perfect is
the fact that now I have these chichi
items that are affordable and I love
them I love all the things that they
stand up for they have great values and
they love pugs oh that's so good they do
ship internationally so if you're not in
Australia they will ship to you so don't
worry about that
if you artist rally there at Target and
Maya I believe and I really recommend
chatting checking out their range and I
think that at the moment if you are in
Australia I think Target having sale I
went to Target yesterday
and I saw that she was like 20 bucks and
also run down there now I really really
really do appreciate you seeing who is
home video I do understand that with
whole videos it's so boring
some people love it that's fun for me a
lot of phobias I store it just sort of
like seemed like a big video look what I
bought bla bla bla and you're just like
oh you're so boring I heard that they
sort of wasn't too boring I gave you
guys a few swatches and my hand is
looking quite attractive it looks like a
30 year old just attacked my hand it's
quite a lot of you do you want me to
make this video
that's why I've done it so please don't
think that I'm being like a big snob
because that's the last thing I want to
come across that I am uploading this
tutorial for my eyes and stuff next
Friday I will see you guys on Tuesday
with my next video of the best weekend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
