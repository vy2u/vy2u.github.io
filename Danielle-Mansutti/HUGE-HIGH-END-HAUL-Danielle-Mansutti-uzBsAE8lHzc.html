today I have my first ever high-end haul
I was a little bit like oh should I post
this because this is just like a
collection of things that I've finally
got my hands on in the past few months
so but I would put it all together in a
big haul
I did ask you guys on Twitter if you
were even interested in a high-end haul
I found that the majority of people said
they do want to see one so they know
what's worth spending the money on so
that is the purpose of today's haul just
to give you an insight into these things
I bought which ones I liked which ones I
don't like and all that kind of stuff so
you know I'm gonna be completely honest
about all the products anyway so let's
just jump straight into it so the first
item I'm going to talk to you about is
the Mac of Burgundy at times nine eyes
shadow palette when I saw this on the
website I thought it would be like a big
big palette and then I saw it I'm like
it is actually tiny I know everything
always looks bigger on YouTube but this
palette is so tiny it's just so tiny and
cute oh love it so I use this on my eyes
today I usually them burgundy shades
from the burgundy palette well if you
don't want to see the makeup look I made
I did make it for the I love makeup
Channel and I will leave all the
description below I made like a fall
autumn makeup look as you can see here
quite a dark smoky look so I'll leave a
stuff down the description if you'd like
to go and check that out it is such a
perfect palette for traveling with I
think because of the size so I'm
definitely gonna get a lot of use out of
this and I found from using it today
it's or what pigmented next thing I have
is the Mac prep and prime I think every
single YouTube in the whole world is
useless except me I don't know why it's
taken me so long to get my hands on it
but I thought it's finally time to get
my hands on it I've heard also that if
you wet your brush with this probably
it's better to pick up like shimmery
eyeshadow and pigments so I'm gonna try
that out as well I did use up my face
today and I'm still not like used to
using it it's a really weird feeling
just like spraying your face with water
I have make
like this does not feel right next I
have yet again an essay law that double
where however I got this in 3c true
pebble and I've also got my other ones
just to compare with you so you can see
comparing to my other double wears this
is the lightest one so I picked up
pebble to sort of go with more my
natural skin tone another one that I
have is 20 and the really dark one is
shell beige that's when I'm like super
duper Craigs and 10 as you can see this
is the sa lot of cat that I've put two
Mac pumps on my other double wedge so
the pumps that you can buy for like Mac
Studio Fix they're the pumps that I use
for this foundation and I'm wearing this
foundation stay as well even though it
is lighter than my other shades I do
feel actually matched me better
what do you guys think I know I'd be the
one to knock me and I never realized I
have ideas so anyway I decided to pick
that up just because I wasn't happy with
my other two double wear shades so I'm
happy with pebble very happy with
pebbles now I picked up the Stila
one-step correct from who else but
chantix a recommendation she always uses
this and I thought I'd give it a go this
is honestly when I looked it up Mike
this is the weirdest bottle ever like
it's so so weird the way it has like the
little no no it's so cool it is so cool
to look at my I don't know how to
describe it I don't have anything like
this that I was like what is going on
but actually I use this day as well I
did find it made a difference before my
foundation application so foundation
application it said actually worked
really well for me oh my god okay I use
this today for the first time I do not
understand why it's not hyped about more
this is me Mac mineralize skinfinish in
gold deposit and can I just say this is
now my favorite favorite bronzer
highlighter thing ever
I'd actually realized when I put it on
my skin I just expected like a bronzer
know why it's obviously not matte but I
thought it would be like a bronzer and
then I did put on it was show just like
luminous and sparkly and gold and with
the Mac soft and gentle unfortunately it
can look kind of money on me
which is weird like after I put powder
on it just looks really weird but I put
this on after powder and it looked
amazing I don't really know if you can
see but this little shiny thing here is
the gold deposit next thing I have is
the Smashbox contour palette so I use
this today I used this dark shade and I
used the banana color for under my eyes
I found that the nautical worked really
well but I didn't like the contour shade
it was really hard to blend I found like
I just put a tiny bit on my brush but
once I put it onto my cheeks it just
wouldn't move no matter how much I was
like forcing it I was like come on it
wouldn't move I don't know I sort of
found it similar to the Australian icing
onto a contour kit dark shades it just
really didn't do the job for me I don't
know I maybe it's the wrong brush or
something it might be my fault but that
was just my opinion of using it today
the next thing I got was the Estee
Lauder transparent pressed powder again
so it is the press powder but it's
called transparent it is not like a
transparent powder so don't get confused
by that it's just a very light light
shade I did use this today as well I
used a tiny bit because I thought it
looked quite heavy so I only just there
just Heine bit on my brush just put all
over my face and I'm very happy with the
finish that it gave my foundation after
applying it it just you know obviously
it made more matte but it also just sort
of blended it all together a little bit
better so I did the job when it comes to
pressed powders it's hard to find a
pressed powder which isn't good they're
all very similar like all kind of brands
but I thought I would get the nest a lot
of one just to see because I do love the
Estee Lauder Double Wear like I thought
maybe you stick to the skin makeup
because this can make it work so well
for me so that is why I think this one I
have a Smashbox blush this is in the
shade paradise I've also used this today
on my face and I did really really
really like the color it actually does
have a little bit of a shimmer within it
it's super pigmented like super
pigmented I put way too much on the
right side of my face just like fix it
up ages but the thing is because a
little goes a long way with this product
you know it's going to last a long time
it's gonna be a
time before you hit pan because you
don't really new like scratch you brush
around in it too much so I actually
really like this is the foam Smashbox
blush that I own and I'm pleasantly
surprised by I think it's awesome
alright you guys have seen this on my
Instagram a few weeks ago this is the
Too Faced lip injection extreme plumping
lip gloss I am in love this absolutely
it destroys my lips it makes my lips
tickle really really really really
tingle and it makes them go very red but
it when it does get a little bit too
intense the paint sometimes though so I
do have to just like wipe it off but
before it gets too bad it does
definitely make my lips fuller if you
are in that ve TBT Olympic Committee
like myself I would definitely recommend
that product it's amazing next I have my
first Bobby Brown product that I own
this is the everything mascara and I use
this today on my lashes this mascara has
like a super basic one but I did find it
is so good for your bottom lashes it's a
really nice mascara just for everyday
because every day you don't want to go
like crazy with the lashes so for me I'm
very happy to use it everyday now I have
three matte lipsticks to add to my like
full matte lipstick collection
well first one that I have is a modesty
which is this beautiful nude color I
wanted something like velvet teddy which
isn't velvet teddy because I'm kind of
sick of using a penny but this is velvet
teddy here and this is modesty here and
obviously modesty is a little bit more
pink and billet teddy is a bit more
Brown and then I picked up a Russian red
which is this beautiful deep red color
it just really is a sexy red that is
what it is it's a sexy red because it's
like a deep elegant color and love it
and then I have media which is what is
on my lips today this is a very dark red
it's actually not purple once you do
apply it on the lips it's a dark red the
reason why my lips look purple today is
because I lined them with the Mac night
moth
lipliner this is like the darkest purple
you can get it's almost black so i line
my lips with this and then I put media
in the middle I had this cool that all
like grainy going on from dark to Reds
that's I really really like that and to
go with Russian red I got the lipliner
in cherry this is just your basic red
lip liner and you believe it or not guys
I did not own a red lip liner before
this haul
yes how do we today so that is my first
red lip liner ever and then I got
another nudie one to go with modesty
this is the saw lip liner and I found
that this looks so much better on me
then spiced like an everyday look
because it's more pinky and spice a
little bit too dark and grass miso and
then I have the mac lipglass in spice
it's inspired by choices to go with the
modesty a lipstick so it should work
pretty well like that and then have this
lip liner as well and next I have these
Mac eye lashes these are absolutely
beautiful and I picked them up because
one they don't have an ugly black band
and two I don't earn Mac eye lashes so I
thought why not give them a guy next
thing I picked up with the fluid line
that brow gel cream in deep dark
brunette I use this on my brows today
and are you ready for this like a drum
roll I prefer it to dip brow oh my god I
dead-set prefer this to dip brow I think
it's because this is actually like a
better color than my dip brow you can
see how much a lot of this is then my
dip brow and my dick browse through draw
now I'll be a Smashbox high definition
concealer this is in the shade light I
use this underneath my eyes today and it
is very comparable to the naked in Urban
Decay one that I always use I like
having a wand like when you can actually
put it onto your face I don't like
having to squeeze it out of a chair
because I just want I use way too much
and then I just waste so much product
anyways okay last but not least I've
been waiting for this one
because it's just amazing right check
this this is the eye shadow times 15
warm neutral palette from Mac sorry I
dunno for some reason this is like $200
in Australia I'm pretty sure I got this
like $50 in America so I don't
understand why it's so expensive in
Australia I pick this up because as
always it's a warm palette and what does
will mean it means Danny talking about
it so I love these shimmers and I love
mattes I love everything I'm going to
use this palette tomorrow I didn't get
it last night so I haven't had a chance
to use it so pretty
