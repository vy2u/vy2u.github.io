today I have a poll and just watch video
for makeup geek eyeshadows so my makeup
geek order arrived yesterday and I have
just been like oh my god staring at them
like that was so beautiful and I'm so
excited to play with them I had a bit of
a playground move today on my eyes as
well so I'm going to do a detailed
swatch and haul video of all the shades
that I chose the only thing that I
forgot to choose was a palette to keep
them in which was kind of dumb so at the
moment that was just loose in all over
the place I really hope that you enjoyed
this style of video please let me know
if you do it and let's jump straight its
stomach straight into it the first
eyeshadow that we have is magic act this
is a foiled eyeshadow and I chose this
eyeshadow because if you know me you
know I love my golden shoes I used on
Tim is way too much so I love little
love
shipments I picked this one and oh my
god it's washes so beautifully as well
so I was like oh heaven the next eyes
shadow is Caitlin rose and Caitlin rose
is a color that I do not have at all it
is a purple foiled eyeshadow it is so
it's just so stunning it almost has a
little blue reflex within the eyeshadow
as well I picked this color up just
because I do not have this color and I
want to start doing more sort of out
there colorful looks once again the
confidence and the practice to do them
so I thought this would be a perfect
little color to choose the next shade is
Coco this is a warm chocolate brown
shade this is perfect for a transition
shade and this is a very warm I shadow
with the red undertones which I love I'm
a warm guy like just avoid the cool
tones and I really really really really
really like this I think this would work
really well in the crease the next
eyeshadow is this incredibly bright
color called Neptune this color I picked
again because I do not have this color
at all I think that this is such an
unbelievably striking bright amazing
color I would love to use it on the
water lines like a poke
or something like that I think it's
stunning and I'm really excited to play
with more colorful time soon but I just
hope this would actually work for me
next I have prom night and prom night is
a gorgeous silvery almost a slightly
rose pink color the prom night title
suits it so well because to me it is
something that I would wear to a formal
event because it is quite sophisticated
and elegant I know it's a weird thing to
say about a color but that's just
wanting to see you and I'd like a look
at it is that kind of weird or under
next we have masquerade masquerade is
whoa it is so pretty
it's a foiled eyeshadow it is obviously
purple for the eyeshadow oh I would love
love love a love of love to work with
all the blues and purples and greens
that you'll see soon to make some kind
of like really weird eye shadows they
swatch so well and like I never really
knew have pigmented makeup geek
eyeshadows well I thought the foiled
eyeshadows might be a bit not so
pigmented because I've never played
around them before but I can't believe
happy winter they are and how she where
they are they are just next I have the
shade everyone needs which is shimma
shimma just a very neutral light
eyeshadow I would use this for an
eyebrow highlight it also has a tiny bit
of shimmery reflex within it so I love
it it's just one of those go-to things
that every girl needs
next is burlesque and burlesque is a
very nice sort of plumbing warm brown
purple it's like a really nice color
it's just in the middle of brown and
purple however when it's washed it does
look more Brown it sort of loses that
little purple tinge within it and this
is also great for the add V of the eye
or just privat of a smoky eye as well my
next shade is gesture which is color I
have never seen before in an eyeshadow
palette gesture is just like a very very
very fresh green color and it is a foil
and eyeshadow
once it's wash onto the skin it does
have little gold reflex in it as well
which i think is stunning and I have
never ever ever used the green eyeshadow
in a tutorial something that I do really
want
venture into one day I think this would
be the perfect shade who you play around
with for a green look one day the next
shade is something that is on my eyes
today which is corrupt and corrupt is
the blackest black that you could want
Kraft is very very very very pigmented
it's very beautiful
I just find however when I use it today
I did have quite a little bit of fallout
that's with my fault for not having the
brush enough but I did have quite a lot
of black folder on my face and then lots
of black smudges on my fence but besides
that it was beautiful and that happens
at every black eyeshadow anyway this
next shade is unexpected and I decided
to pick the shade because I do want to
work with sort of a purpley pink
eyeshadow in the future so I've chosen
this shade to go on my lid for that
future tutorial and it is a very
beautiful this next shade is absolutely
unbelievable this is a flamethrower
blender is absolutely stunning how many
times can I say absolutely it is so
gorgeous it looks to me like a crystal
like something you'd find in a cave oh
that was weird
I just absolutely love this and I could
not wait to use this I want to use a lot
of the warm tones like a very smoked out
warm orange eye in the future I've never
worked with orange and this is slightly
orange it's like a golden orange but
we'll see how it works it could go
either way but who knows unless you try
this next shade is called brown sugar
and brown sugar is just a matte Brown it
is a very very sleek matte Brown and it
is something that I've picked because I
can never have enough just neutral warm
mattes and I decided on this one because
it is a boring and I love having a few
boring eyeshadows the to serve as well
now going with what I said before about
wanting to do like a pink purpley soft
eye to Charleston I also picked a census
that
sensuous good to go without that eye
shadow result this is a little bit
darker it is a purple it's matte and it
is a very beautiful swatch as well this
is just picked to go with these other
eyeshadows but I did pick it because I
don't actually have a purple like this
underneath my
I shadow palettes because none of all
the pebbles that I have an eyeshadow
palette so like shim is it's kind of
weird and this isn't a eyeshadow show
that's on my lids today it is drama
queen I have drama queen on the middle
of my lids and also on the outside of my
lower lashline and I found that this was
sorted when I use it today I think all
makeup geek eyeshadows are just
incredibly pigmented anyway they are so
nice whenever there's a hyped product on
YouTube because I have always found that
makeup the eyeshadows I like really
hyped on YouTube there's always a risk
when you order it do you order a lot and
then they might not be pigmented and
you'll be disappointed or do you order
just one or two and have to do another
order in the future but I can honestly
tell you guys that these are shows of
some of the most pigmented eyeshadows
I've ever used before I really really
love them and I will give a full review
at the end but I just want to say like
this video is not sponsored or anything
that I'm just doing this out of my own
freewill because you know you guys
wanted to see it it does sound like I'm
a talking advertisement but trust me
these are just my thoughts or my
opinions however I do really want to
convey to you guys that these eyeshadows
are just amazing they're seriously
amazing and if you can't tell from the
swatches already then what else miss hey
next we have a color which is all over
my hands because I don't know why it's
so just a little bit before this is pull
side and pull side is beautiful my
favorite blue color in the whole world
is like this sort of icy blue I love it
I don't know how well I go with penis on
my eyes I don't know if blue eyeshadow
would go with blue eyes because it's not
contrasting and it might just like kind
of weird but it's something I do want to
explore one day here is an eyeshadow
which is just the girliest thing you'll
ever see this is it whimsical it is a
foiled eyeshadow and it's a very light
angel pink I really like this color
because it would be perfect for stuff
like prom it's incredibly pretty
incredibly feminine I think it is just
like well thank you I also picked a
starry eyed which is very similar
because I feel like these two would work
very well together they are both foiled
eyeshadows and star add is just a tiny
bit more
Carly pink I find following those two
eyeshadows we have grandstand which is
also a foiled eyeshadow and I love
grandstand because it is stunning
I love the forward eyes shadows in
general because I think that they are
absolutely amazing and I'm a girl who
just loves shimmers anyway now we have a
creme brulee it's something which I have
seen so many American UG Oh something
I've seen so many American youtubers use
as their transition shade is creme
brulee oh my god I can't even do it
creme brulee it actually reminds me a
lot of the peanut butter shade in the
Too Faced semi-sweet chocolate bar
palette so creme brulee mm-hmm
love it love the name amazing the next
eyeshadow is last dance does have a hint
of brown within it as well and this
would be like really perfect sort of
crease out of the dark smoky color I
think it's very pretty to complement
that shade I picked Showtime which is a
foiled eyeshadow I think they worked
really well together they both have this
sort of powerfully brown warm thing
going on except this is the shimmery
version and I think that they're both
very beautiful and now we have Pegasus
which is just the most beautiful thing
you've ever seen instead of foiled
eyeshadow it is very icy blue once it's
watched so that is my haul and swatch
video what was your favorite eyeshadow
please tell me in the comments so I hope
you have a great wait guys I'll see you
really soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
