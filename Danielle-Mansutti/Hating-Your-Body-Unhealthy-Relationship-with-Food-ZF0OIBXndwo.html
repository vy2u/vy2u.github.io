to my channel and try to remember how to
do this whole camera chitchat thing I
did post an Instagram this morning which
is kind of revolved around a topic I am
so blessed and so fortunate to have an
audience at 1.4 million of you mind I
just feel if there's any way that I can
make your day better or make you feel
better or make yourself to yourself a
different way and spread positivity
spread good vibes and I couldn't ask for
anything more making others happy for me
is such a heating I love making other
people happy you may have noticed that
recently on social media positivity
whether that being how you treat people
and also positivity in terms of
self-love have been a really really big
thing for me recently because I have my
struggles don't from my videos like
creating positivity although I would
love to live like this a lot of times
when I sit down and I compare myself to
girls on Instagram there are times that
I sit down I feel like I'm worthless I
feel like why can't I look like her why
can't I have her life why can't I have
their relationship and social media just
almost like consumes me and I just yeah
compare myself to so many other people
and think that my life in relation to
this is bad or I'm not living life to
the fullest or something wrong with me
because I'm single and I don't know we
just get very consumed by social media
which you know at the other day is
curated by us and it's what we choose to
put out there which influences an impact
on other people what I want to talk to
you today about is your body and I find
that so many of you in my comment
section open up to me and admit to me
that you do have struggles with your
body and I feel like we all do like I've
never met someone ever before who's a
woman who has told me I love my body
there's nothing wrong with my body I
would never change anything about my
body and how because like we want to all
reach that today to our lives is having
the kind of self-love with our little
baby steps that we can take to get there
so personally I have had some of the
most unhealthy moments relationships
with my body
and it's all kind of stemmed from
different things that triggered it for
instance when I was 14 years old and
I've never admitted this before on
social media online whatever but when I
was 14 or 15 years old we had like a
school debutante swarm what kind of
thing kind of like prom I guess and my
boyfriend at the time made a comment
about how I wasn't skinnier like the
other girls and how I had weird hips and
how I should go for runs more often like
the other girls I instantly went into
this crazy little phase where I wouldn't
eat my mom would always pack me a lunch
school and I wake up in the morning I
probably like pretend to eat breakfast
or skip breakfast or whatever because my
parents are always around and then I go
to school and as soon as I get to school
gate I'd open the lunch box and I would
ship everything out into the bin and
then I would not eat the whole day come
home and then maybe have dinner and then
go to bed
so I'd eat one meal a day and I did this
for about a month or two months straight
and I'm not saying that I was anorexic
I'm not saying that I had always
diagnosed with having an eating disorder
but I actively went out of my way to
deprive myself of food to ultimately be
skinny and what do you know two months
later it came around this whole like
debutante thing I didn't fit in my dress
obviously because my idiotic actions I
didn't fit in my dress I had no energy I
was like passing out fainting feeling
horrible all the time I almost just like
woke up one day and it snaps in my head
like what am i doing why am I doing this
and the school that I went to which I
will without a doubt always say is the
worst school environment like I hate
that school with a passion it's not my
private school anyway like we know we
all know stories and have fun at school
and say I go to the canteen and get
something like chicken strips or a hot
dog or something I would sit down and
the girls would look at me and they say
are you seriously going to eat that and
there was this like weed community in
that school where girl
just kind of like looks down on you if
you were eating and it was almost like
they were promoting not eggs it was cool
and when I left that school I found out
a year later that six of those girls
were taken to hospital and really died
from how much they were starving
themselves so of course when you're that
young that is the most toxic environment
to be in
I feel like once that's happened to you
once I'm not saying that I would ever do
that again or would you know I don't
know I don't notice that I would never
ever ever let myself do something like
that again because it damaged me so much
and it was just a really silly thing
that I did and I shouldn't have done it
but when you start to get that mentality
it's really easy to come snap back into
that unhealthy relationship with food
once you have had a period of time where
you have been really dealing with things
in an unhealthy way over the last year
my journey with my health and my fitness
and my body has been really up and down
like extremely up and down because up
until last year I ate whatever I wanted
I hardly put on weight I had a super
class metabolism and I was a smaller
weight than I am now even though I'm
eating right now I've been like I'm
eating good stuff now maybe right now
and then I started training I got a PT
and a nutrition plan and totally change
the way I started working out gaining
muscle and then when I stopped because I
just couldn't find the motivation to
keep doing it or I made excuses up that
I was traveling and couldn't train or
whatever I put on so much weight
afterwards in places that I had never
put on weight before and then it I
realized that hold on a minute now that
I've decided you know exercising and
eating right my body can't snap back
into what it used to have of eating
anything all day and then just being
like super skinny and never caring about
your body because once you gain muscle
it's got to go somewhere where it's not
being used so I then was like oh crap I
need to carry on doing this fitness and
diet lifestyle because
if I don't I'm just going to put on this
away I roll acted very last year of
phases where it goes so hard with gym
and exercise and I'd eat so clean and
such small portion sizes and I had a few
different pts a few different
nutritionist and one of the nutritionist
that I had told me something which was
so dangerous and so toxic and I followed
it and I was miserable sorry about the
noise Brent look scratching the tripod
but they told me that I should be in a
calorie deficit I should lose weight and
that if I'm going out do you know with
friends one night I shouldn't eat
anything all day and I only eat the
dinner and I don't know if maybe that's
good if you want to be like a
competitive bodybuilder or something but
that was so unrealistic for me I would
wake up and I would be so miserable and
so hungry and I could be anything and it
just it didn't work for me maybe it
works for some other people but it was
so strict
it was so unrealistic and I just didn't
like that way of thinking because it
really snapped me back into the whole
like feeling like I wasn't allowed to
eat food and it's just the wrong way to
approach it for me in particular I
believe that you should be eating the
right food not less food that is like oh
I don't know you will understand if you
have been through a similar thing of
having an unhealthy relationship with
food that when someone tells you you're
not allowed to eat who your brain is
like what what's going on so I went
through a whole bunch of phases where I
would literally follow as kind of advice
and I would train so I and I honestly
was mister ruler everyone's little
exercise endorphins oh whatever whatever
I was like no like I was so miserable no
energy so down and it just wasn't worth
it so then from that I start binge
eating where I would just go all out and
eat crap food every single day and you
know I feel I don't care like I'm
happier this way
bla bla bla but it was unhealthy
psychologically I
feel so guilty I feel like shame to
myself and it's always like I would eat
from 3 times the calories daily then I
was the week before and that's not
healthy going from like 1,500 to lay up
to three four thousand of just junk and
constant back and forth back and forth
like because I've experienced that now
and I've had these up and downs and I
will do a proper fitness journey once I
have reached my happy place I have gone
through moments where I've really hated
my body and really hated myself and I'm
really bad a psychological mindset when
it came to my body and right now in the
past two or three months I've been in a
really good space where I see a personal
trainer three times a week I'm not as
hard on myself about the food that I eat
I'm a lot more relaxed about it I'm
doing this journey now for being strong
being fit and being healthy not to be a
certain way or be a certain number on
the scales it's more about how I feel
and I have so much more energy when I
eat right it's so good like sugar energy
is like the worst good free energy is
really good I would constantly fall into
a cycle of spending so much time on
Instagram especially Explorer page and
you always see the same kind of body
work through per flat stomach really
nice round balm and maybe like really
nice boobs and the girls really can
share some of it's like a speck of body
hair or anything wrong with your skin
like this is perfect perfect body kind
of girl and I just I know I would have
sat over this and I'd look at them but
why can't I look like that like if I
look like this and maybe you know people
would like me more if I look this way or
that way and my trainer now who does
compete in like for yielding shirts and
stuff like that she told me which I had
no idea about but a lot of the time when
you see especially sweet girls I'm not
saying I ordered it it's just some just
a change of perspective when they have
their photo shoots and stuff when they
do look that way they literally haven't
drank a drop of water and they are do
hydrators they are fasting so that
they're not loaded or anything like that
and there's so many factors that go into
it them to look that way it's not like
they would have their entire day and eat
three meals and then look that way if
that makes any sense so I finally get
down on myself mostly at the end of the
day but your body is holding so much
food of course Kim it was just relative
in the morning your body's working so
hard to break it down and make it into
you know certain things that your body
needs and it should be love for doing
that that's what I think is so much
stuff about our society is that we don't
spend enough time loving what our bodies
does for us and instead we will look at
it and we hate it and we point out
things about which are different to
other people or you know we think is
wrong or bad or ugly or fat and it's so
damaging we waste so much energy doing
that I just don't understand what
benefit we get out of picking ourselves
apart besides feeling like crap and
that's why in this video I want to tell
you that your body is literally the most
amazing mechanism in the entire world
because your body will cure you if
you're sick your body can cure so many
diseases without you even knowing like
you just can sit down and your body is
working so hard fighting to you every
single day to make sure your lungs are
breathing your heart pumping your
kidneys awakening you live is working
your stomachs working like everything is
working constantly and it never gets a
break it never gets time to just like
chill out I'd never get thanked enough
for all the stuff it does and the most
amazing thing as well about our bodies
especially if you are a woman is that
your body can create another life form
and that is the most amazing thing in
this entire world but I can say that my
body can be used to create someone
else's life and that's the kind of
perspective that we should have when we
look at our boys we should look at our
bodies and think this is a beautiful
thing you know it doesn't matter the way
it looks it doesn't matter it's
obviously all the hard work thank you on
the inside and just watch how amazing it
is that's the that is the mind that we
should have
when it comes to your boobs you know if
you're thinking my boobs are so small
guys like and it likes me outside
chested I look like a boy bubbles of
laughs I feel you I've had those
thoughts if you have big boobs and you
think that people staring you too much
they're so uncomfortable you just hate
them I feel okay your boobs literally
are there to supply milk to your child
can you imagine like if a cow wanted to
get bigger others because it felt it
would attract male cows more you don't I
mean like I'm kind of glad in the way
the big boobs face kind of you know it's
changed the big bun phase now because
things change all the time but it
doesn't matter you have big boobs or
small boobs or fake boobs or no boobs
like your groups are literally there to
supply nutrients to a baby and that's
the way they should be looked at it
absolutely rages me when people think
they have a right to tell a woman that
you can't breastfeed in public the fact
that our society has sexualized
something so natural like that it's just
so wrong and I know for sure that when I
have kids I don't even care I'm hoping
at it out it was a bit of a restaurant
and if anyone tells me off I'm just
going to be like so you never did this
before like when you were a baby you'd
ever suck on your mom's boobs before it
is normal it is natural and anyone that
thinks otherwise society is messing with
you it is messing with you it's normal
if you have stretch marks from hiding a
child they are the most beautiful symbol
on your body that you've been strong
enough to do something like that I hope
that I'm making sense here I just wish
that instead of focusing so much of our
time looking at unrealistic photos of
people that aren't us and they're
bullied in their life and their faith
and their skin and whatever I am
thinking why don't I look like that it
doesn't matter it literally doesn't
matter if you have a flat some it could
be stomach big hips no it doesn't matter
I'm on my own journey I've got my own
struggles
I'm kind of in a different situation to
a lot of people are because I get
criticized every single day on my body
and how I look online I get people
taking screenshots with my body from
other people's videos and telling me
that I'm fat I get people constantly
telling me what's wrong with my body and
when this comes from a stranger noticing
things about your body picking them out
you're going to automatically assume
that everyone in the world sees that as
well that is so damaging and if you do
that why are you doing that like you
just need to stop it's not benefiting
you it's not benefiting me it's not cool
like no one gets satisfaction out of you
calling me fat or you trying to put me
down it's just a waste of energy and
luckily I'm at a place in my life now
where that won't affect me because back
in the day I would have seen this that
people constantly send me images of my
body from bad angles and say all your
actually so fat and you look a certain
way and your photos just to try and make
yourself look skinny do you not
understand that that can so easily cause
someone I'm not going to eat food today
or I'm going to like you know just have
a really toxic mindset of not wanting to
eat or even being sick after eating or
whatever just to be skinnier it's so
wrong even if I was bigger they say that
I put on my double my way and I was
bigger what right do other people have
to comment on my size it is my own body
and I don't think that it's fair to
judge anyone on what their body looks
like and this especially accessible who
are slim telling them that they look
really skinny isn't helping them either
that is actually quite a damaging thing
to say so no matter what just pick
people up and embrace each other and
spread positivity to each other look at
someone's body and think about the one
thing that you love about it and tell
them that when I was in here in Ireland
it actually blew my mind I sort of asked
you bye and sitting down at one point
and I just went up to and I said you
have really beautiful eyes by the way
like I just looked at her eyes and they
were so stunning and I didn't really
think it had an impact anything because
I actually do say compliment
to people all the time because I feel
like it costs nothing to make people
happy and I went back to my room and
then I saw on her Instagram story that
it made such a huge impact to her that I
had told it she had nice eyes and it
really made her day and I just can't
stress enough how important it is to
lift others up because one happened it
costs nothing it will just make the
world so much better this year today I
have to sit down and I had to just tell
you guys that you are so enough the way
you are don't feel you have to look a
certain way up in sit and when I look
like her I'll be like a you as yourself
you are enough your body is an amazing
mechanism which should be loved and
treated as a beautiful thing because it
is it is absolutely beautiful and it's
amazing what does see every single day
and I hope that you never look at
yourself in the mirror and hear these
horrible thoughts about yourself and the
next time you look in your mirror you
see oh my god my body's doing so much me
right now and I cannot thank it enough
even one person feels a little bit
better at this video I just really hope
that we can all start to just support
each other especially as women we can
just bring each other up more and so
tearing each other apart because it
would make life so much easier my camera
is about to die I've been rambling on a
little bit but super important to me I'm
surviving through my own journey for
sure I've got a long way to go still
hopefully by mid year end of the year
I'll start to feel really happy and in a
place where I have a very very very
healthy relationship with food and with
my body but little baby steps and we'll
get this and I hope you guys enjoyed
this video please save one nice thing
about yourself to yourself today and I
will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
