bedroom
today's video is quite different today's
video is something that I've never ever
spoken about my channel we are talking
about sex today
let's get it out it's like Oh sex talk
so I thought I would film this video
today because it's something that we
should we talk about it's a bit of an
educational video it's a bit of a
interesting video and something very
different very taboo I love talking
about things that might be a little bit
uncomfortable because the things that we
should be able to talk about we should
be able to talk about freely without
feeling awkward or embarrassed or
uncomfortable so today we're going to
get run into it and talk about sex in
this video today I will speak it away
which is suitable for all audiences
because I know that I do have a young
audience as well and I don't want this
video to be dirty or anything like that
this is gonna be more educational and
we'll be talking about the journey or
very talking about does it hurt for the
first time we're going to be talking
about all that kind of stuff so let's do
this so talking about sex is so taboo so
awkward to talk about you might feel
like you don't really have anyone to
talk about it where that we have
questions about sex that you just feel
like people will judge you if you ask
there is a very positive happy place we
can discuss this kind of thing without
feeling uncomfortable don't feel awkward
don't feel embarrassed don't feel
comfortable because we're just talking
about it human to human sex is like the
most natural thing in the entire world I
mean your parents did it I will do it it
happens every day in every country in
every place in the world and I feel like
sex education especially isn't really
taught the right way because you're left
with questions that they weren't answer
because you chose to ask it I always
found really way with sexual education
at school than to show you like pictures
of like the reproductive system to show
you like what happens when you're
pregnant but I didn't talk about very
relative things when it comes to your
sexuality and sex like that
but I feel I should even though I can
imagine it you know as a teacher be the
most awful thing teaching sex ed to a
bunch of teenagers they need to be more
specific they need to be more open about
it because it leaves a lot more feeling
right confused and a lot of people find
themselves in situations what they have
like no idea what to do so one of the
most common things that I saw when I
asked you guys questions to ask me about
sex was to like the peer pressure that
you receive now a lot of people who
responded to me were teenagers and
saying that all my friends are having
sex why am I not having sex is there
something wrong with me feeling that
sort of pressure to kind of be like
everyone else and understand what
they're talking about because you're
like why is I real having sex that I'm
not like what's going on and that was me
when I was a teenager as well so don't
worry I was definitely the same and I
know exactly how it feels how you're
like all my friends like they've done
this they've done that and I just sit
there and listen to them because I've no
idea what they're talking about majority
of people that are talking about all the
stuff they probably haven't even done it
before were just saying it and if they
have done it then good for them but it
doesn't mean that you should be doing it
as well I feel a very important thing
when it comes to sex and losing your
virginity is to not rush into things
because you will regret doing that so I
just tell you that when you get your
twenties it doesn't matter how old you
were when you had sex it doesn't matter
if some girl in your math class had sex
before you like it doesn't matter I know
that it's like a huge pressure to feel
when you kind of feel left out and
confused about things so when you get
older it's more likely that you'll be
thankful that you waited and you had a
great experience
instead of rushing into things to kind
of like fish in with your friends and
the peer pressure middle another comment
a question that I received on this topic
was how do you know when you're ready to
start having sex or to have sex for the
first time that is a question which
can't be answered by myself because
everyone in the world is different
everyone
was an experience however there are some
common things when it comes to sex that
you will no feel right in terms of being
ready so I think the most important
thing to realize and remember and
understand it uses yourself if you
haven't had sex before if you have does
really matter you can still use this if
you can't openly talk to the person that
you're going to have sex with about how
you feel about it maybe it's not such a
great idea if you can sit down with this
person and you can tell them you know
that you're feeling a bit anxious about
it you're a bit confused it might be a
bit clumsy and they kind of laugh and
make you feel embarrassed mmm
kind of think maybe they're not ready if
you are with someone that isn't ready it
will only make you feel bad like you'll
just feel no connection and it just yeah
it probably won't be a very nice
experience so it's definitely a big
thing to communicate with the person
because communication is keen for all
this and if you can't communicate with
them about it I don't really think that
they're ready as much as you already but
definitely never feel pressured by them
to do anything you have every right in
the world to tell them no and if they
don't respect that you're saying no you
need to get up and you need them like
you do to leave a person behind never
let anybody pressure you into doing
anything that you don't feel comfortable
with ever when it comes to sex and
sexuality or even kissing someone like
if you feel comfortable with it you tell
them no at the end of the day if my dog
can understand the command no and the
person that is pressuring you into
things can understand the word no so
always make sure that you are sort of in
control and you feel comfortable and
okay
about going hell with it but if you feel
unsure and you feel really stressed out
about it then maybe just wait a little
bit longer it's just one of those things
that ultimately if you're feeling that
way sex will actually probably hurt more
because if you are very stressed and
very tense
that's when sex will hurt because that's
when your body is like all tensed up and
your muscles are really really really
tired it's not going to be enjoyable
with you so that's why the first time
for a lot of people won't hurt because
you are very tense and you're very
stressed you know what's going on
everything like that that's why it hurts
more than the whole popping my cherry
thing you can like a pop your cherry
like horse-riding it's something which
doesn't have to be done only through sex
what does come to pain because you know
you might be a bit scared because our
first time hurts so much whatever I
think it's more the embarrassment and
the clumsiness and stuff which will kind
of stick with you but that's completely
normal because if your first time don't
be scared about it hurting if you're
with the right person and you were both
comfortable ready to do it then you're
more relaxed it probably won't hurt as
much as it would if you like stressed
out and you know feeling very unsure
about it all and let me just tell you
that every single friend that I have
that lost their virginity to peer
pressure and they were very young and
did it with a random person I don't have
a single friend who told me that they
don't regret that like every one of my
friends that did that say that they
really regret it and they wish they
didn't do that and they waited like a
girlfriend or a boyfriend or something
because something which looks fun like
that kind of thing like a one-night
stand or something majority of my
friends is dead it's anything but fun
because you're both so uncomfortable I
both are awkward with each other and
it's just a really kind of weird
situation I'm not saying that if you do
have sex with a random it will be
terrible like I can't speak I don't know
I'm just talking from my friends
experiences I didn't lose my virginity
to a random phone
and so I can't speak for that I was in a
relationship when I lost my virginity so
I waited till I was ready and I'm very
happy that I did I'm very happy at the
choices I made for that that's just my
own personal choice and it's your
personal choice how you want to lose it
if you want to wait to a marriage if you
want to wait until you're in
relationship
it's your choice so don't think that I'm
trying to tell you the right and the
wrong with it I'm just speaking from my
own experience to kind of let you know
how certain things may go because my
friends definitely regret kind of being
with around the person that makes sense
not only is it incredibly important but
it is such a good idea to think about
the contraceptive methods that you're
going to use before you're even sexually
active so to find what kind of thing
works you I totally understand that if
you feel uncomfortable or a bit awkward
or whatever talking to your parents
about it because you're quite young I
understand that and I understand you
might be scared that they're going to
judge you and get angry at you for like
bringing up these things that's a
natural thing to feel when you're going
to talk to your parents but I'm sure
they wouldn't be I'm sure they would
help you out if you are being safe but
do you realize if you feel if you can't
talk to a parent then it definitely
speaks to like your family doctor or
some like that because they've been more
than happy to help you out with
contraceptive and it is so important and
it's something which I feel definitely
needs to be highlight a little more when
it comes to sex ed because it is very
dangerous to not use contraception you
don't to be a situation where like
you're pregnant and you don't want to be
you don't want to be in a situation
where you catch a sexually transmitted
infection it trust me it is so much
better to be safe than sorry when it
comes to these things because it can be
really bad if you don't use
contraception and I don't want that for
you like I want you to be safe
I want you to be
okay so definitely look into things
before you become sexually active and
girls carry condoms with you if you are
going to be in a situation where you
might sexist I like that carry them with
you because you don't want to fall into
that lousy excuse of a guy of not having
any it's so stupid or it feels better
without kind of guys no no no no make
sure that you have them yourself because
that's not okay they can't kind of trick
you into doing that because I don't
think they realize what it's like for us
because they don't get pregnant the same
you know but it is very important to be
protected and I know it's something
which is joked about a lot and talking
about it always seems very embarrassing
and stuff like that but honestly it's so
important and it's something that you
really have to take into consideration
because I want you to be okay I'm
talking to you like you're my daughter
or son I'm just like please be okay
darling most importantly your sex life
is your own private life knowing the
world has a right to judge your
sexuality or your decisions when it
comes to sex except you because it is
you and your body it's very important to
remember that I definitely feel that
there is this annoying sort of thing
that we have in our society where people
are expected to have sex by certain age
and you know boys are considered to be
like them an inflatable it's a sex a
lots of different sexual partners and
then the whole thing I forgot a lot of
sexual partners and she's my boarders
really disgusting names don't know much
I won't say because you know what they
have I just think it's so annoying how
people can judge a person on their
sexuality it doesn't it just doesn't
make sense it has nothing to do with
anyone but yourself and remember that if
anyone is trying to bring you down by
either calling you and then because
you've had too much sex or a name
because you're a virgin or you're
approved or whatever ignore it I wish
that sex which as you
in a different way in schools and I wish
that it was something which wasn't so to
do and so crazy and everything like this
because it's the most natural thing in
the world end of the day and it's gonna
happen whirlwind of sex one day and so
what makes me sick seriously it's such a
funny thing how our societies look so
obsessed sex and everything like that
but so what tell anyone judge you for it
do what you want to do just be safe and
make sure that you will comfortable and
I wish that sex ed in the way was
actually taught earlier because this is
little bit Iowa period and I was nine
knots before we had sex ed I no idea
what's going on
so definitely felt like I wish it was
total up earlier luckily my mom actually
sort of told me what periods were pretty
much like a month before I got mine
which was very lucky because I always
want to thought I was dying the parents
should be able to talk to their children
a lot more openly because I actually
feel personally like a lot of people we
end up in situations where they get
pregnant or they get an STI or something
because they feel like they can talk to
their parents about it and that sucks
like I want to make sure that when I
have children that they can ask me
anything about sex and I can openly help
them and discuss it with them if my
daughter asked me about one in
contraception or whatever I would help
her I think parents need to understand
that your kids aren't trying to be these
like sexual monsters and lose their
innocence and all this stuff if you're
not going to help them it's more likely
that it's going to be worse off for them
so I def
think that if you are a parent watching
this and you have like a team the team
child I'm a good team yeah a team job
that sounds a little bit teen daughter
or son then definitely sit down top them
and do like I do just sit down with them
and be like we're gonna talk about sex
so let's just do go around and get all
the awkwardness at the open and let's
talk about sex this is a room with no
judgment let's talk about it however you
enjoyed it and I hope it helped and if
you have any questions then please feel
free leave in the comments and we will
chat down there so I hope you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you all very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
