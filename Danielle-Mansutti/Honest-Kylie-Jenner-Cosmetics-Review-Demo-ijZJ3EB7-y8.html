today's video I have a bunch of color
cosmetics to do a first impressions on
so I have absolutely no idea why I was
sent these
I didn't buy these I just randomly had
them sent to my parents house I can't
figure out how I got my parents address
but um it's all very confusing but I'm
not complaining cause look what I have I
thought I would give both the lip kit
and the eyeshadow a play with today so I
have come up with the look that you can
see on my face right now this video is
completely honest movies always are you
guys know that if I don't like something
I will tell you I do like something I
will tell you it is an honest review I'm
not going to be like super positive in
hopes that Kylie Jenner will see it and
she'll share it like oh my god I hope
she sees the kind of thing I'm like no I
would much rather let you guys know if
it's worth it if it's not worth it then
oh my god color that's the way but
you're kind of thing so in today's V I'm
going to start with the lip kit I'm
going to move on to the eye shadow so if
you like to see if they're worth money
and you'll see my true opinion and
honest opinion on the products then
please keep watching so as you can see I
have applied my face makeup prior to
giving this bad boy a go but you guys
have seen me apply my face makeup by the
zillion times the exact same way and as
this is like a first impressions I'm
gonna get straight into it so I have
three lip kit lip kits
lip kits to choose from so we have this
color here called a love bite so we have
this one here called brown sugar and
then finally we have this one that
called dirty peach so judging by the
color on the side of the boxes I'm not
going to pick this even that much as my
nails I'm not going to pick the Sun
because I really like brown nudes I'm
going to open both of these and then
just sort of decide from the color of
the actual lipstick which one I want to
go with so this one is a dirty peach and
this one is brown sugar so I think today
I'm going to use straight peach it's
really pretty
there's also a lip liner in the lip kit
as well it's about wasting any time
let's just start doing it oh my god
I can't talk when I do lip application
things know this it was lighter than my
lips my lips are now lined even though
it's so hard to talk like this this lip
liner feels so similar to colourpop lip
liners my opinion like the creaminess
and the texture and everything it's now
going to be the last user in the world
to jump on the kylie jenner bandwagon
and let's apply to look at I don't like
this color really not a fan this color I
am gonna go and apply brown sugar
instead I kind of color does not suit me
at all
okay around dude okay so here is the
color applied onto my lips it does feel
really matte and it does say on the
packaging it's a matte liquid lipstick
so it isn't that sort of conditioning
nice soft feel it's the it's very dry
feeling the thing I find with matte
lipsticks is that they feel horrible on
but they look great so your brain is
telling you like they must look really
bad you feel like they're like dry to
being but they ain't
I think another part that I'm really
excited for we're going to be playing
with the eyeshadow palette so the one
thing that I will address before
actually using the palette which is just
an opinion of mine - please don't count
I do feel that for this palette it is 42
US dollars for the palette and I have
not yet tried it so I could take this
back and I do feel that slightly
overpriced I think it's about sixty
Australian dollars or so a lot of money
so I'm going to see if the quality is
worth priced and everything like that
but that's why I never bought anything
from Kylie cosmetics personally because
I just feel like it was obviously really
hot and I didn't know if I was going to
get my money's worth or if it was just a
hyped product but that's why I'm so
excited pilot
today I can actually decide for myself
so I'm going to be starting with this
shade here which is called citrine
however that's on my crease and use it
as my crease / transition shade this
brush step I'm grabbing another one okay
so that shade is a lot more pigmented
than I had expected I have heard so many
mixed things on YouTube about the color
cosmetics that I just was under the
impression that they were just like
non-pigmented
lalala whatever so I'm going to actually
try it for myself and you know creating
my own opinion instead of listening to
people make like clickbait titles like
Kylie Jenner scandal ever like that
color
it matches the lip really well I'm sure
make sure I can actually like they
complement each other very well tonight
the crease colors on I'm going to dippin
it up a little bit with this shade here
which I believe is called obsidian
obsidian I think oh yeah obsidian
couldn't be anything else so I'm going
to use that with the same brush in the
same area just to deepen it up even more
I'm actually really quite pleasantly
surprised by this I don't know why I had
such a low expectations but I think that
these shadows are very pigmented they're
also very blendable which is great but
I'm very happy with them which is
awesome so I think next I'm going to
play with this shade here which is
called Goldstone if the names of
Kimagure actually corresponding to wool
good one daddy I will use this show here
which I believe is called gold stir and
now I have a big fat finger mark in the
back I'll tell you what so far guys I
have not had much fallout which is
amazing now for my lower lash line I'm
going to go in with this shade which is
true once again and then I will be going
over it in select the outer part of my
lower lash line with AB student like I
hope I'm saying that right now playing
that op soon showed really tightly on my
lower lash line so as there are two
shimmery shades and the pallet majority
is just like warm mats but there are two
shades here which arch shimmery I do
want to test one of them out should I
think which one might try out the really
light one it's actually like really
pretty really really pretty it's not too
silver thank God I was worried it's
going to be like flit filled up so now
that the eye shadow and the lipstick has
been applied my honest opinion is that I
am actually really pleasantly surprised
I was under the impression that these
qualities were bad and that's why you
should just listen to gossip you should
make up an opinion for yourself I didn't
want to buy these because I kept her on
YouTube where they weren't pigmented
they weren't blendable animals can stuff
but they are so pigmented and they are
so blendable so I'm actually really
really really pleasantly surprised about
this palette and very happy with it and
I'm really liking this very full
appropriate look that we've created
today I've kind of say that I'm so about
it and she's her first look oh I was
just like hell no but ultimately I am
very impressed I'm definitely gonna be
using this palette a lot more because
you guys know I love warm tones like the
last time I did a cool tone makeup
tutorial was nervous and those are the
four wheel and stuff like that I did not
have to wipe under my eyes at all which
is amazing so even though I packed on
such product onto my eyes I don't seem
to have any
all at all which is just amazing and in
terms of the color selection in this
palette would be really nice it had like
a nice red tone or a nice gold shimmer
or something that would just improve the
palette such more I would have made it
like a 10 for me because the formulation
is amazing it's blendable it doesn't
fall out
it's pigmented formula very good with my
lips if I didn't have a mirror right in
front of me I would be like they feel
horrible because I hate the feeling of
matte liquid lipstick it's just like the
but actually looking at it in a mirror
I'm like it looks okay yeah it looks
fine I really love the color it
complements the eye look really well as
well and we really interesting to see
how this holds out for other day when
I'm like eating and drinking and all
that good stuff and so my final verdict
on the colleague was my experience I've
tried today is that I'm very pleasantly
surprised they were a lot better than I
had expected okay the thing about Kylie
Jenner guys she's 19 she has achieved so
much in her life she gets so much
criticism so much hate and so it's just
malicious behavior online when you
actually brought it down the fact that
she's just a 19 year old girl she's got
a successful cosmetics line she's doing
so worth looking well for herself that
I'm like you go go I am all about
successful women supporting each other
empowering each other I feel like no
matter what people say about her she is
someone who is just doing immensely well
for herself at 19 it's you've got to
give it credit for that so I just start
this phase impression with the
impression of these products were
overhyped overpriced
and they weren't going to be good but by
trying them I have actually completely
changed my opinion I would buy this with
my own money I would quite happily spend
50 whatever it is dollars on the pallets
so that's pretty much it I really hope
you guys enjoyed this first impression I
was as honest as I could have possibly
been I really appreciate that so if you
want to see more of these sort of like
first impression style videos like
in-depth reviews on certain products
that I receive or I buy
please let me know in the comments
because I don't really do many reviews
and it'd be great to know if you like
that how many times can I go like this
with my hands I'm being so expressive
right now I really am Italian today
Oh proving point I really hope you guys
enjoy this video today I love you all so
much and I hope you have a really day
