today I'm going to do my in-depth
contouring and highlighting routine
because I've never really done one in
in-depth I sort of they're just like
always skipped it before so I thought I
would do a proper tutorial for you guys
and just show you how I do my contouring
so that you enjoy let's get straight
into it so now I have a full face of
foundation on and going it straight into
the contouring so I'm using my estrela's
AC on top contouring and highlighting
palette so I should put it online
because I can find it at Priceline I
think it's 1695 at Chrysler so because I
bought it online I had to also pay for
the $10 shipping so this is the contour
palette looks a very very similar to me
is the Anastasia insider
I don't know fairway hills contour kit
and this is what I'm going to be using
today and the reason the sort of cool
toned brown and I'm going to be using
this sort of funky Wyatt highlighting
shade or under my eyes and this shade of
the very area to highlight now I apply
my concealer underneath my eyes I do not
do just under my eyes and do it so I
like a triangle shape because it just
helps to I don't know why it helps it
looks so much better
so here I would definitely recommend it
I just start by doing a wide like this
my sort of boat straight down as you
guys probably seen that famous Kim
Kardashian contouring photo she had the
same sort of going on with her
contour as well as you can see is very
sort of little radiant looking below
nothing problem there I'm also going to
be repeating this I'm using my ELF flaws
concealer it's my favorite brush book
and see how it works so well on insane
say hey it's not my concealer I'm going
to go in with my powder isaac
translucent powder puff you can probably
work through this probably pressed
powder I just haven't found my favorite
easy translucent one so here we're just
gonna hurt
powder and then contour at the top and
this step is completely optional as well
I like to use a powder because I feel it
helps my makeup lasts a lot longer
during the day so I bring you guys a
little bit closer to see my contouring
in depth and I'm going to be using this
whiter shade here just for underneath my
eyes just to set everything in and I'm
using a brush from public and I'm just
using this just to brighten up
underneath my eyes and you can already
see there's quite a big difference
between both eyes honest different
a lot lighter and brighter and whiter
and and I also a little bit too my
fallen now that will be nice and glowy
I'm gonna have to counteract that with
the contour I'm going to be taking this
middle shade here and I'm using a real
techniques foundation brush whoops
so you apply this come to us so this
stuff is so Connery's you're going to
make sure you only put on the tini
and what you want to do is when you suck
in you can sort of beauty friends
anywhere if you are but I always do it
you can just sort of feel for your
cheekbones and you'll see workers
inwards or you can just place a brush
from the ear down to the corner of your
mouth and what you want to do is to
start from here the ear and stop about
here because we don't want to go too far
down because it just looks very obvious
and not natural what so but I just for
it everyday natural look we don't want
to go to bypass here so I've got a
little bit of powder on my brush and I'm
just going to start to work this
downwards
I like to keep the idea of less is more
because you don't want to go like
full-on on your face and then you can't
blend it out and it's forceful just do
like this start very small strokes then
just build it up and up and up to us
exactly the way I want
it's once I have a very small line like
that like left hum I grab a little sort
of angled contour brush I have this one
from a clinic I've no idea where it's
wrong
I just want of those brushes which I
think probably saw my mom a long time
ago but anything like this and you can
even grab a powder brush like that and
put on a bobby pin and squeeze it and
then you have the same kind of brush so
I'm just going to grab a little bit more
of that same product and just start to
blend it all through and then as I go I
like to start blending it upwards like
this just so that the contour also is on
the side of your face because then it
all blends in it's really natural so as
you can see now we have that sort of
shadowy look that we're going for with
the contour just don't go too crazy with
it because the more you use and the more
obvious against it can start to look
really bad I've only got the teeny
little bit and then I'm going to use all
the excess from my brush and I'm just
going to apply this through my temples
and up to my forehead so as you can
always see this is looking a lot more
sculpted and shadowy and all that kind
of stuff and then this side is still
quite boring and so next we're going to
work the same Brown onto your
so I'm using that same ski tension brush
and I'm just going to work with the
natural shape of my nose and I like to
work it all the way down just to the tip
of my nose and once I get to the tip of
your nose I like to just do a big shape
announcement blend out that nose contour
I'm taking a little bit of that same
pattern we used on our underneath the
eyes and I'm just going to blend it in
with the contours make sure the lines
aren't too much and the final step now
is to highlight so for highlighting we
are using this color on the very end I'm
going to use the elf flawless concealer
brush just for the highlight because I
don't want to go too crazy with it and
having a small brush helps to keep it
under control so I'm just going to apply
the highlight above my cheekbones and
then I like to also work it down on my
Cupid's bow and then also just a minor
if you'd like your cheekbones to pop out
even more than you can add a very small
highlight underneath the cheekbones just
to define it even further so thank you
guys so much for watching today please
let me know your thoughts and feedback
all that stuff and anything that you
want me to answer them please leave it
in the comments so I love you guys and
see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
