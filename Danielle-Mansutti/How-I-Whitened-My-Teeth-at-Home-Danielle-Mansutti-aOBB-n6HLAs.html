may have noticed something a little bit
different about me and that isn't my
teeth or finally white yeah I had a lot
of comments now for quite some time that
my teeth were getting a little bit
yellow so I thought I would do something
about that and for those of you that
happy on snapchat you have been
following my journey to the past week of
my teeth whitening I've been keeping you
updated every single day with all of my
teeth whitening processes a lot of you
are asking like what teeth white are
using and all the stuff that this is
what I've been using so I wanted to wait
until I made a video about it to explain
the full thing instead of just giving
you lots of different information from
different places so firstly what I think
is most important is that I don't let
you guys know that what we're talking
about today is smart brilliant and smart
brilliant did email me to try out their
teeth whitening product and I was really
interested in their product cause I've
seen anything which works well it does
like an at-home kit so I thought I would
give it a go so I do want to let you
guys know this video is sponsored but
after I tried this I would recommend it
to absolutely everyone on the whole
planet I'm obsessed with this stuff and
I'm going to keep using it for as long
as I can to be honest my expectations
weren't like really high and it's just
completely exceeded them because my
teeth are white see the white and wait
go to yellow so it's like yes finally so
this video is to let you guys know how I
did it the process of my teeth whitening
what I had to do and what kind of stuff
and also like for more technical side of
things you want to learn a bit more
about how it actually works so I decided
to go ahead with the teeth whitening
process because as you may have noticed
in some of my videos I have had a little
yellow stain on the outside of my mouth
now I don't know why I've had this
because my whole life I've had really
good dental hygiene especially when I
had brace his I was crazy about my
dental hygiene I brush my teeth twice a
day everything
and i flossed and i look after that he's
mouthwash but no matter what I did I
always had a yellow stain on these teeth
yeah it did ruin my confidence a little
bit in photos and also in video I've
watched something back and I'd be like
oh my god my teeth look so yellow one
thing that really led me to trying out
smart brilliant was because this is not
like a bleach white crazy shiny white
smart and not meant to make your teeth
look like bleach white like super crazy
shiny white all that I'm doing is
actually like stripping back of teeth
and cleaning your teeth to make them
their natural color again more than like
crazy wife and I can't stop smiling
yeah very average person will need 7 to
14 applications so far I've done my
seventh today
so I'm going to get going for another
week don't really need to but I just
want to keep it up because I'm loving
this smile and I'm also going to mention
a giveaway with this product at the end
so stay tuned for that these syringes
which I'll show you guys all the kind of
stuff syringe transmitted like whoa but
I'll show you in video form and there's
really like three applications and a
syringe and all that kind of stuff so
I'll give you guys a bit an overview of
how I did the whole tooth whitening
process now so what's my kit arrived I
had a fully assembled kit it had three
teeth whitening gels free Italy
sensitizing gels three blue putties
three white putties and blue impression
trays the first thing that I did was mix
the putty and the setting in the blue
impression tray and had to do this
pretty fast because it sets pretty fast
so I have mixed it until it was a solid
blue color and then I started taking my
impressions so what I had to do was
position fingers on all three points of
the tray and press and I set my timer to
make sure I'll actually lift the right
amount of time and then all I did was
fill up the returned impression card
insert the card and my dental
impressions in the envelope and then I
sent it back
so bad we planar my impressions arrived
so I learned that a minimum of 30
minutes is recommended for absorption
into the tooth I normally did one hour
so the first step is the teeth whitening
gel syringe so I just remove the
breakaway cap and apply the gel to the
trays and make sure that my teeth are
brushed and flossed beforehand which is
really important you don't do this as du
DT and then I just applied a thin ribbon
of gel on the front inner surface of the
tray that comes in contact with the
front of the tea actually hold the gel
to the entire surface area of your teeth
without interruptions so the saliva will
not wash the gel for tooth and all it
pull in the tray and another plus is
that you don't need to worry about your
lips rubbing the gel off your teeth and
then I just insert the trays and I use a
forward pressing motion to avoid
dragging the gel down the gel then
spreads evenly over the front surfaces
of my teeth and then I wiped away any
excess gel with a q-tip so then I only
waited about one hour for this I did
leave it in once for two hours but I'm
not like sat around with one hour mark
because I got really hungry and I ate
something so after an hour I took out my
molds and then I stretch them under tap
and then dry them to make sure they were
clean and then we moved on to the
desensitizing gel so the point of the
desensitizing gel is that it replenishes
all the essential vitamins and minerals
that you lost during the whitening
treatment and then I inserted my trays
and left it in my mouth with 15 minutes
and then I just had to avoid eating food
for a minimum of 30 minutes just to let
your saliva do its thing which was a
little bit hard but I think it was white
because I couldn't ate as much and that
is pretty much the whole process I
didn't want today the past week and I've
had really really good results so
because I love smile really because they
give me a nice we have come up with a
giveaway for you guys so you get three
