today's video I'm doing quite a juicy
spill battalion Q&amp;amp;A style video I asked
you to send me questions on Twitter
about being youtuber and answering
questions that people normally try and
avoid answering I think that if I were a
viewer there's lots of questions that I
Burano as well how much money youtubers
make drama that goes on all sorts of
stuff so I thought I would just make a
video so make sure that you've got a
drink or a snack and let's dive into it
first question is from Brianna who asked
when you make videos / posts on
Instagram snapchat or Twitter do you
spend a lot of time wording things the
right way so people don't take it the
wrong way you have I second guess
absolutely every single thing that I
post onto my social media is to think
could someone be offended by this could
someone take this the wrong way
I never post anything that's intended to
be offensive I just know that some
people may look at it in a different way
so you do spend so much time censoring
yourself and rewording things and is
quite big task
have you ever met any guys oh my god
okay have you ever met any guys who have
tried to use you to get famous / oh yes
and the majority of guys that I have
dated have so much of a surprise to me
anymore to be honest I think alarm bells
go off in my head when I'm seeing
someone and they talk more about
followers and social media and
everything that I do
wanting to get to know me it's more
about how do I grow on YouTube how do I
get followers and it's like the thing is
when you are you too but you are very
isolated so I'm at home all the time
because my job is at home and
unfortunately it doesn't allow me to
sort of go outside and meet people like
if you're in a an office building you're
around before time and you meet people
so how do I meet people normally through
social media and therefore I meet guys
that are on social media as well and a
lot of them have wanted just to grow
essentially so yeah last year I met
someone who I really liked I started on
I started to ask myself does he know
anything about me or does he just want
know things about the internet and then
I thought you know what he's never asked
me anything like what my favorite kind
of music is or my interests or who I am
as a person but was all for like social
media stuff and I don't know I should
have learnt from that but I didn't it's
great I really like a really difficult
situation where like either I can date
someone who's not on social media who
will not understand my job and kind of
not really understand me because my job
is my life or find someone on social
media like but not quite one percent of
people that actually aren't on it for
followers not on it for fun that would
be ideal because yeah I can't stand just
sitting around talking about followers
and what time should I post and all this
stuff it's just it's such a brain dead
conversation I want to date someone that
I can actually talk about life with and
deep topics because oh my god Alysha
makes me wanna fall asleep when people
start talking about that kind of stuff
what would you say are the best and
worst parts about being on YouTube such
being someone more well-known whoa the
best part there's a lot of good parts
definitely I think the good part is the
opportunities that you get the
opportunities that I've had to travel
especially last year I literally went on
what was like 50 60 slides or something
the opportunities that it gives you for
that is amazing so I would say that for
me is like my biggest Oh amazing
amazement oh my god that's not even a
word worst thing mmm is the scrutiny
because you're not a celebrity at all
you're not a celebrity not in the
category of a celebrity but you are not
considered normal and what I think the
worst part of being a youtuber session
one well-known is is when people
scrutinize you and criticize you for
your appearance your personality your
life your content everything about you
your friends who you're dating
everything's under a microscope and it
feels like sometimes you have no privacy
or people of concept rying to find ways
to I don't know make you look bad or
expose you or whatever and it
it's quite exhausting you know because
it's like sometimes you just wish it
could be an old person that makes normal
mistakes then you make a mistake and
then it's done but when you're youtuber
if you make a mistake it's there forever
and it's highlighted under this exposed
and yeah it's a lot of pressure for one
person to change yes definitely if you
say yes to a sponsorship do you get told
what you can't say about the product and
what you can depends on the sponsorship
personally I reject sponsorships that
have scripts but some sponsorships do so
some of YouTube's visible sign of
sponsorship and basically in return
they're given a script of which they
have to read out word for word on their
video I think it's different for every
single each of it because personally I
will always try the product before I
promote it and a lot of the time I
decide not to promote it because money
doesn't really mean anything to me it's
just the fact that I want to support
products that are actually good and I
actually love and the majority times
that I show product on snapchat tagging
on Instagram whatever it's not sponsored
it's my genuine word because I don't
want to ever throw something in your
face that I don't believe in or doesn't
work just because it gives me money that
does not sit well with me but basically
when you get contacted for sponsorship
it's different for every single company
and it varies so it's very difficult to
answer that 100% as viewers you can see
straight through when something scripted
I think you know exactly what videos are
scripts on YouTube and which ones aren't
because you guys are here to support
real people and not watch like wooden
commercial style videos if you know what
I mean most of the time during the
sponsorship naturally the brand wants
you to mention certain things in that
sponsorship I'm all down for that if
they want me to mention there's a
certain ingredient in the product that
makes it really great cool I'll talk
about it because I love the product I
want to educate my audience on what it
is and what is inside of it but if they
literally gave me like a piece of paper
and I said read all of this and don't
change anything about it and you must
use it as your opinion then I'm like no
but I'm sure some youtubers do
personally doesn't sit well with me and
I can't act just take my life so me
reading a script is just like so this
product is really good it's just it's so
fake so I always actually like actually
give my genuine response and feeling
about the product
but yes it does vary within the YouTube
code in all honesty with how big the
industry is now is it even worth someone
starting it to make money from it
oh that is a good question
who I was thinking about the summer day
actually it's insane how big youtubers
now that was so many youtubers not there
it's nuts like I feel within the last
year you're gonna have like it just went
mad and there's so many youtubers
everybody first started and there was
hardly any one about like that was
really cool because it was just like
people who YouTube Daisy
everyone misses and everything but I
think it's cool that there are so many
people that are able to do this now I
think that's awesome it should be
celebrated I do think that it is
tremendously harder now to start YouTube
and become successful I was very lucky
that when I started I literally started
before the massive peak of youtubers and
luckily got in there fast but I feel
like if I started now there is no way my
channel would be at the level that it is
now I do think it was just timing was
really good for me so I think if you
have the passion and the commitment to
make a youtube channel and to upload
consistently regardless if you get one
view or a million views so my suggestion
to you is if you set about two days a
week where you can upload because I
think chiapas better than one a week and
make sure that you upload on those days
at that specific time you work your ass
off absolutely work your ass off you
will get something back from it whether
it takes six months or a few years it
will happen eventually and I didn't file
just what I got I do recommend that you
do start I know there's some each of is
that may say there's no point don't
bother but who's to say that like you
don't know you might start it might do
really well but it is more down to your
commitment your consistency in your
dedication to the YouTube channel
because he's just kind of like half-ass
it there's too many people you know for
that to work these days so I think it's
worth a shot but I definitely think it
is a lot harder now than it used to be
have you ever met someone who acts
different when they're off camera
compared to when they are filming /
doing a collaboration yes I have
actually and it surprised me because
they were one of my favorite youtubers
and I was just like oh okay
uhm good as a youtuber you know that
when someone comes up to you whether
it's a viewer or another youtuber like
personally I will drop everything that
I'm doing to be like how are you what's
your name let's get to know each other
you're my friend but I am like so
grateful for you guys so I will drop
everything that I'm doing and I met one
youtuber who I loved like adored and
unfortunately they were quite rude and
quiet abrupt of a bit arrogant and stuff
and it was just really disappointing
because they were very different in
their videos so for me to meet them em
for them to be quiet standoffish and had
this massive sense of self-importance
like they were just like sure important
to stop to say hi to people that was so
sad hmm and then I could never watch one
of my videos again because I got such a
bad impression and I really made me
think as well that I never want to give
up my kind of impression to anyone I
mean it's the most part most people you
meet are just bit shy err in real life
because we all have our camera persona
and then in real life we might be a
little bit shy which may come across as
a bit stuck-up I guess but most people
just like really nervous because as
youtubers we are quite a nervous Bunch
normal people don't normally talk to the
camera in the room by themselves and um
I go outside and talk to real people so
that explains that one pretty well and
the golden question and you to be there
how much do you earn a month from
YouTube the golden question how much do
you she was actually make is quite an
eyebrow raiser cause legally I can't
give you a complete figure of me
personally but I will generally speak
here youtubers in the US get paid
significantly more than anywhere outside
of the US and for me personally I
actually don't make as much as most
youtubers because I don't do that many
sponsorships because I just don't want
to like flood you guys with that stuff
and I started YouTube to be really
creative and the money is just a bonus
for me but it's not my main goal if that
makes any sense so you get paid every
single month regardless in Adsense money
so the way to work at Adsense
essentially a very gentle way of working
it out is remove the last three zeros
from a beer and that's normally how much
the youtuber made on that video just by
the ad money so if they have a thousand
views they made $1 if they have a
million views they made a thousand
dollars if that makes sense so you've
got to think those youtubers that get
like 6 million views a day and upload
every day they've been making you know
upwards of 6 thousand a day just want to
add money and that's without
sponsorships that's a lot of money I
think a lot of money from Adsense but
sponsorships very dependent for some
youtubers especially in the u.s. a lot
of those last chips can be six figures
so in like a hundred thousand from range
which I've never done anywhere near to
that I think that's incredible that
people can make that kind of money just
from you know this kind of media it's
insane you Sugar's can be like walking
billboards and just kind of be like a
commercial so you got to think about how
much money people put into billboards
and magazine ads and TV ads and I'm
essentially doing that but to a youtuber
so for me personally with my Instagram
following of well no one is like half a
million and then on my YouTube I've got
one and a half million my YouTube rates
are very different to my Instagram rates
because of the difference of following
following follows on each one so YouTube
is where the big money's are because
Instagram is very very easy to just take
a photo and upload it but the way I've
always thought is fair is that if you
look at someone's following considering
the exposure and sales that youtubers
make for companies and their products I
think for a YouTube video it kind of is
a fair estimate to say the youtubers
should be given one percent of whatever
their following is as a right us
my budgets than Australian companies and
also the US are quite far ahead and
understanding how powerful social media
is in terms of styles for brands so it's
quite difficult
basically let's just say the u.s.
influences you watch will probably make
maybe six seven figure sponsorships
first once like pretty big money
okay I can't even like I measure that
much money it's insane but for anyone
outside the US sponsorships most likely
five bigger poor picker in that range
but very low if I figure hopefully that
makes pretty sense and I'm not saying
it's how much money I make it's just a
rough estimate because yeah I don't know
it's weird it just kind of depends for
each youtuber but definitely the US
they're making that money and I'm so
proud of them because that's awesome
that I can do that it's really cool
let's just hope for the companies
outside the US start to like catch up
with them because that would be a lot
fairer for the rest of us got here that
kind of get screwed over by our location
but the thing is I did have the
opportunity to move to IIIi did have the
opportunity to make those rates and you
know become an LA youtuber a beauty
crazy person and probably good at
cutting blonde again boob implants and
stuff because I know how insecure I'd be
if I lived there I know that I'd do that
kind of stuff but happiness for me it's
more important than money so that's why
I moved to England instead of LA I kind
of feel like I've loved making YouTube
videos but I feel like I don't really
fit into the beauty industry very well
sometimes my raw honest opinion is that
I love making videos and I love working
but sometimes I find it quite difficult
to fit in with the influences and I
think I struggle quite hard in the u.s.
to to be quite happy because I wouldn't
be able to like find a friend about
makes any sense cuz I just I'm quite a
weird person so it's quite hard for me
to to make friends I mean this year I
guess and I hope you enjoyed hearing
quite in-depth things about YouTube in
the industry and I hope that you
understand it all a little bit better in
have any questions both and please feel
free to ask in the comments and I'll
chat to you this - have a great day guys
