welcome to my bedroom yeah I thought I'd
do nice chill relaxing video on how to
apply false lashes for beginners you
don't want to expect perfection the
first time if you do get perfection good
on you but I definitely did not it's a
queen you actually understand how to
apply them properly today I made a
little guide for you on how to apply
false lashes urban is informative and it
helps you out and let's jump into it
when it comes to false lashes there are
lots of styles to choose from you'll
find that there are eyelashes which are
natural ones that are more for parties
and ones which give you effects like a
cat eye look for example the I spy
lashes in smitten a perfect if you want
to achieve a natural look moving on to
something more dramatic like this style
called midnight this is perfect for sort
of like an evening glam look or a party
look or something like that the last
distinct eyelash style is one like this
this is called Luna and this style is
perfect you want to achieve a cat eye
look and can also slightly modify the
shape of your eyes to make them look
slightly more almond or round so once
you have a general idea of what lash
style works for you
what you're going to need is the lashes
some tweezers and of course you need
some eyelash glue my favorite eyelash
glue is the Ardell brush on lash
adhesive once you have your lashes and
everything ready just take them out of
the box and then once you have the
lashes sitting on the little white tray
get your tweezers out to gently remove
the lashes from the little adhesive that
keeps it onto the tray and just be very
gentle because you don't want to ruin
them
at this point if you find the lashes a
little bit too long for your I always
cut from the outer corner so not your
inner corner the outer corner and now
I'm just applying the brush on it he
sifts the lash and also focusing a lot
more on the inner and outer corners now
for the fun part actually applying the
lashes so I like to come down with my
lash from the top down and get as close
as I possibly can to my natural lash
line at this point I like to use my
tweezers to squeeze the lashes to my
natural lashes and also use my finger to
sort of make sure that they're in place
and squeeze them all together so once
again I'm just aiming for the middle and
then I'm squeezing the lashes on the
inner and outer corners to make sure
that everything is glued and secure I
know that it looks weird in tweezers
like in your eyes but it's something
that you will get used to I promise and
simple as that you're done so here is a
before and after and here is the lashes
on I thought you guys enjoy this and
found it very informative and I'll see
you all very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
