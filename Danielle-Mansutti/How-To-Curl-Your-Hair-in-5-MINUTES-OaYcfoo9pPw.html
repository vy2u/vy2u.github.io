about to kill my hair and I thought you
know I'm going to show you is let me ask
how I curl it in that style that I wear
all the time important things first I
wash my hair yesterday because I find if
I wash my hair the day of curling it's
just a bit weird a little bit fluffy so
this is my day to hair and it literally
takes five minutes like it's so so so
simple all you need obviously is a
curling iron you can use a hair
straightened out I do find a canal iron
is easier for this and I always use
quite a thick rod you'll also need some
hair ties I'm using for ideas quite big
here essentially we're planning a hair
into four bits to that point got four
but if you do have spin or short hair
you can't get away with using two and
then of course a hair brush and some
hairspray as well how did you like it
but you want to be high get from this
hair to this then that's creepy watching
okay I'm standing here because my big
mirror is right there otherwise whatever
weird don't go on here essentially the
easiest way to do this in five minutes
is a little trick that I had just to
taught me and it saved my life so you're
going to want to part your hair down the
middle and then cut it into two sections
like this I'm just going to go like this
so they have one part up here and now
I'm grabbing all the rest of my hair and
I like to tie it up closer to the front
so kind of lenses now if you have a
sleek glamorous look whom to piggy tails
on the side or like this I'm going to
brush through to make sure all its no
knots I'm going to throw that other bit
out the way and then grabbing a curling
iron I like to divide my hair into three
or four pieces per Bunch
and then I wrap it around like this away
from my face so I hold the curling iron
in this little way so I have the plastic
against my scalp obviously then I'll
have a metal rod in your scalp and I
give it about 10 to 15 seconds and then
drop like this and then I'm going to
throw that behind and grab the next
section now we have one bunch which is
curled like so I do strongly recommend
to never actually put your curling iron
on the wall actually have a metal tray
which I put on so I put my carpet before
and learn from it so I'm just going to
grab any hairspray and just give it a
little spray like that
and then I like to scrunch the hair up
like this just added texture then I'm
going to let that drop I mean you can
grab your hair brush and just literally
very lightly just sort of look at it
like this just make sure that the curls
aren't too tight so we have this effect
which is so handy so essentially you do
only really need two hair ties I mean if
you're someone that can't stand having
hair in their face and I recommend
having four and time it up into four
bunches from like the very start but I'm
quite happy to just repeating the same
steps once again before we divide it
into three sections again and then curl
if I wasn't talking explain all the
steps you can see how the top on the
bottom which he takes two minutes or two
minutes two minutes each side again I'm
grabbing my hairspray and then I'm just
going to do the scrunch thing again and
I'm letting my hair out and the reason
why I actually do this method is because
I find it's much quick of one and
secondly it actually gets the back of
your hair as well get a nice and so much
how when I curl my hair like in sections
and stuff like that I can never seem to
curl the back for free so now that my
hair is down I'm going to give it a
quick brush and then I like to go back
in to make like the finishing touches
grabbing my curling Island again I'm
just going to take little bits like this
which you just cut a little bit on the
end and then quickly push them through
and now as you can see it's looking
quite tight and frizzy
a bit I'm going to loosen it up a bit
using that same technique as before I'm
just going to take my brush and just go
like this through my hair to make sure
it sort of softens up a little bit and
just like that it's all softer and
fluffier and nicer if you want this sort
of effect I definitely recommend
brushing it out and stuff like that if
you want it to be sort of tighter then
just leave it but I felt like that there
you go and I hope that you guys enjoyed
