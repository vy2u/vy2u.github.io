going to show you a beginner's guide to
eye shadows this video is great if
you're not very confident with applying
eye shadow or you just want to brush up
on your skills so in this video I'm
going to show you a really really really
easy basic eye shadow tutorial I used
three different types of Brown to create
depth within my eye today and this is
perfect like an everyday use it's
perfect for beginners and I'm also going
to show you the right tools tips tricks
and hacks to create a really beautiful
blended eyeshadow this video today will
demonstrate the formula that you'll need
to apply any eyeshadow that you ever
want I threw out the next few weeks I
will be creating a lot of how-to guides
for beginners because this is the kind
of stuff that my mum asked you all the
time she says how do I apply eyeshadow
and how do I apply eyeliner so within
the next few weeks I'll be doing a lot
of these videos so if you want to keep
up to date and we in the world to me if
you would hit that subscribe button down
below
I've put up two new videos every single
week I would love to have you on board
so now let's jump into it and I hope you
guys enjoy when it comes to applying
eyeshadow the first question that you
might ask yourself is what color
eyeshadow should I be applying so all
you have to do is get up a color wheel
onto your phone onto your computer
anything this is the perfect way to find
out which I shadow color will suit you
and of course you can wear any eyeshadow
color that you want but this is perfect
if you want to know if your eye color
what would look at the most flattering
with your eyes so as you can see I have
blue eyes the where determine the most
flattering color for my eyeshadow is to
look at the opposite color of my eye
color you can see that my eyes are round
of this color here therefore the most
flattering colors for me to create on my
eyes of these colors here so sort of red
tone pink tone warm eyeshadow colors
will make blue eyes pop and look really
beautiful same with if you have green
eyes then you would look really
beautiful with like a purple kind of
eyeshadow and then if you have brown
eyes you are incredibly lucky because
you can pretty much pull up any color
that you want so if you do have more of
a warm brown eye you would look
beautiful with really cool tone colors
if you have more of a cool tone eye you
would look really beautiful warm tone
colors so in order to create a lovely
contrast in your eyes and make your eyes
pop and look
beautiful it's great to pick the
opposite color to what your eye color is
so this will be your perfect little
guide for knowing what color suit you
best but of course you can always wear
any color that you want I wear blue eye
shadow with blue eyes it's fine like you
can experiment all you want but if you
want to know for the beginning what to
use and definitely refer to the color
wheel guide the biggest step in this
whole process is actually knowing what I
shadow to use I would highly recommend
to spend some money on a high-end
palette your first eyeshadow look
because it's very difficult to create a
really beautiful I love with most
drugstore eyeshadow palettes and by
high-end I just mean the brands kind of
like two-faced stealer Tarte nos Mac all
that kind of stuff they have beautiful
formulas and so my first high-end part
that I ever bought was the Too Faced
chocolate bar palette and this was an
absolute game changer for me because the
formulas on it was so beautiful and what
I mean by that is that the color
basically comes off really strongly and
really vibrant and a very important tip
when you are going eyes shadow shopping
is to swatch the eyeshadows by swatching
the eyeshadows you are seeing how strong
the pigmentation is of the eyeshadow and
therefore you will see how strong and
easy it will be to work with with your
eyes so if I pull down my sleeve the way
I'm going to show you this today it's
all you have to do is rub your finger in
the eyeshadow pan and give it a little
swatch on your wrist and this will show
you how strong it is so to face our know
having really beautiful formulas it's
what you do is just grab something this
one which is a shimmery shadow and you
just swatch it on your wrist like that
so showing you this very close you can
see that this is very pigmented because
I just did a very light swatch of that
and it came up beautifully on my arm and
then I like to swatch a matte shades one
that doesn't have glitter anything and
see how that works as well I'm going to
take this brown shade here and then
we're going to swatch it down like that
so you can see it is incredibly
pigmented it's beautiful and it's a good
palette you just have to lightly brush
your finger on your wrist and if it
comes off like that
and it's probably worth by to insure my
eyelids are prepped and ready for
eyeshadow and first we're going to
tweeze any straight eyebrow hairs that I
have on my eyelid to make sure it's nice
and smooth and ready for the eye shadow
application for eyeshadow I'm using this
TARDIS Pro palette because it's got such
a beautiful range of colors and I'm
going to firstly use the lightest color
in the palette and apply this powder all
over my eyelid and this will ensure that
all the colors come up really
beautifully as we have a nice light base
using the right kind of brushes is vital
for perfect eye shadow application
dipping the blending brush into the
innocent shape from the palette I'm
going to ensure I tap off the excess so
that we don't have too much product
transferred onto our eyelids we call
this the crease color or the transition
shade because it creates a really
beautiful depth within your eyelid so as
you can see I'm avoiding putting this on
my lid at all and I'm just using it in
that little crease that we have it
creates a lot of depth and it's
incredibly flattering to start with this
first before applying anything onto your
lid I'm using circular motions with my
brush I'm holding it quite low as well
to achieve this effect now we're moving
on to a flat brush because we're going
to be applying product straight onto our
lids I'm taking the lightest shade
tapping off the excess and I'm going to
put this in my inner corner and stop at
the middle of my eyelid it does tend to
be more flattering to keep the inner
part of your eyelid light and the outer
part dark as it creates depth and it
just looks a lot more natural so after
you apply the light shade to your inner
corner now we're going to darken it and
deepen up the eye shadow by applying
some into our outer corner some reason
is don't brush by Real Techniques with
this shade called whimsy and I'm going
to make sure my top of the excess
because it is a very dark color now we
like to call this the outer V on the ice
you can kind of see from your lashline
up to the crease is a bit of a V there
and just start applying the product
right in that crease so then use your
blending brush to ensure that you can't
see where one color starts and one color
ends and it's all nice and blended and
here you can see the huge difference
that putting a dark color or only on the
outer corner creates for your eyes I'm
now going to add a little bit of shimmer
by using my little finger directly into
the eye shadow I do this because with
shimmery products they tend to actually
come off a lot nicer with your finger
than they do with a brush and I'm just
applying this over the light shade in
the inner corner now taking the lightest
shade
hysterically underneath your eyebrow
very lightly to create a really
beautiful eyebrow highlight then of
course finish off the look with some
mascara this is the Too Faced better
than sex mascara and it is amazing
so here's how the eye shadow looks it's
very simple very wearable and I really
hope that you love it and so that
basically is the formula that you need
to apply any eyeshadow that you want so
just remember the three golden rules
keep it light here dark here and
beautifully blended and gradient and
transitional here that's all you need to
do for any color that you want so you
can do like dark purple here light
purple here and then like a medium
purple there and it will look beautiful
and flattering for you so I've had a
really lovely time chatting with you

helpful I will be doing more how-to
videos in the future I shadow does look
