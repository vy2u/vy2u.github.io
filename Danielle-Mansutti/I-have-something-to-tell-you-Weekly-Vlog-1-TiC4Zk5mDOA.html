annoying but this reflection in my
glasses okay you should be able to see
my eyes a little bit better than so
right now it is Thanks
in the morning and I'm ready my makeup
on I'm dressed today is really exciting
I'm going to an event with coverfx
then I'm having a meeting afterwards and
I just feel like vlogging like I find
that when I go on YouTube and I look
through my subscriptions
I just watched vlogs like I love
watching people's blogs and I thought
wouldn't it be fun to just do weekly
ones that kind of challenged myself to
do a blog a week maybe uploading like a
two Sara Wednesday and also have a
Sunday video as well I think it would be
fun to do weekly blogs and it will also
give you like an insight to my life and
you can see what I get up to in the week
and all that kind of stuff so I think it
could be like really really fun and I've
got a bunch of trouble coming up in the
next few weeks a few months so I'm
really excited about this let me know if
you think weekly vlogs are like a really
cool idea so in other news different
camera lens I know so many of you hate
my wide-angle lens or what some people
call my skinny lens so I have just
bought a new lens for my camera which is
actually the standard kit lens that it
comes with
let me know if you prefer this like if
you feel it's more real all that kind of
good stuff but I feel like I'm so doomed
in because tommy was my wide-angle like
it's really far away but I have a car
picking me up in like 15 minutes
and I'm also gonna be with Nicole who so
you might know I'm very excited to see
her and catch up because I have lots of
life update which I'll also update you

chains are from Laurens boutique and my
shoes are
Nike and my pagas cute

so I know negative for and I had to
stigmatism online now put them both like
one or whatever you guys are like blind

getting some new glances treat myself
some a Balmain Wilson's the vet say it
was awesome it was so beautiful like
that she learned a lot about the white
of my highlighted correctly and I know
that I wasn't doing it the correct way
which is a little bit scary I had a
really exciting meeting office as well
some things could be coming out soon and
on my train a little feedback oh my god
so I trained stopped halfway because on
my train line they like disconnect
carriages halfway or something but
whatever um we're just sitting there
like 20 minutes and this announcement
comes on and she literally says sorry

work days everyone get off the train and
we were like what very honored sir thank

virtues recently I've been mowing

stuff like capsicum or peppers whatever

do is add some rice to it as well it's
so easy like Italy takes two seconds the
roasted veggies I get from Tesco they're
already like pre in a little like what's
go ahead packet for the oven so it's
really easy I normally eat the tomato
and basil version I just have this to
try cuz I try this one yet but in like
three two one you'll see what it looks
like when I've actually cooked it and I
also just add some very very seasoned
into my chicken as well to make it a
lead of expensive and boiler boy a lot

the Instagram I wanted to ask you what
you think about Instagram tutorials

make and I find that I actually watch
tutorials on Instagram more than YouTube
myself so I want to get your feedback on
that that would be really really really
awesome but it is time to go so just go
okay I am home and this is what I got

I just didn't blog much oh yes but we
went to hotbox which was in Shoreditch
and it was just so loud and we couldn't
get a table facing each other and it was
just a bit weird so we decided to bail
from there pretty fast and then we went
to just like an all bar one and sat down
and had shaking laws of bubbles which is
really nice and just caught up about
like so much stuff so exciting that
we're actually traveling together in a
few days you're so excited about it and

this way it just started
hey guys I just got home so this weekend
I've spent it with my special someone
and I just such crappy weather today

the hospital today to visit him and just
missed him for a surgery which kind of
sucks I am home now I've got some work
to do I have to finish editing my house
tour which goes up to do it so we have
to say if you haven't seen that click

sent me a bunch of this is like the best
thing in the world for that like quick
get up no makeup kind of makeup day and
then they also sent a planner and I love
this not only because it's marble which
is my fave but it's just like so
beautiful and laid out so nicely I'm
absolutely wrecked like I don't know why
I'm so tired so I'm just gonna pick up
things in a second but yeah I do want to
quickly quickly put in here at the end I
have someone in my life now who may be
the absolute world to me and you can
issue what I make by that but this time
around learning from mistakes I always
believe in the private life as a happy
life so I'm sure you guys could just
respect and understand that I'm not
gonna be like blogging him all the time
because I just I don't know I don't know
like
right in space plus he has nothing to do
with YouTube or anything like that and I
kind of want to like keep my private
life away from work sometimes

this on camera but yeah we've you know
