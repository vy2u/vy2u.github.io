finally telling you this I've been
wanting to tell you this for months now
like months and months a month and some
of you already guessed it actually but
essentially I'm leaving where am i
leaving I'm leaving literally my entire
old life and I can't believe that I'm
actually doing this and jumping to the
next step and everything it's absolutely
insane as of June 2017 I am going to
England I'm going to England for about
six to twelve months to start with and
saying bye back to Australia for now and
starting a fresh new chapter of my life
in England in I'm so excited that I'm
finally telling you this because I have
known this the so long and I have been
stressing myself out just dealing with
all this stuff that I have to do all
these forms all this everything that I
have to do so that I can move back to
England I can't believe a microsecond
that low there's been a secret office
Holly and I have been dying like not
being on to each other routes because
she'd known the whole time that I'm
moving back same would like a few of my
other English friends and they tried so
hard to like spoil it on Twitter or
anything but I wanted to wait until
things were actually set in stone and
secure and everything and organizing Ben
has travelled that's all organized now
so yes Ben is coming with me of course
he's coming with me it's going to be a
huge new chapter in my life my parents
aren't coming my family are still going
to remain in Australia it's just me just
for a little while just heading back
seeing what happens there and I'm so
incredibly excited to see what life has
learning for me there but I've had a gut
feeling to sort of just go back for a
little bit and see how I am there and
yes this means that a lot of things are
going to be happening over the next few
weeks in order for me to move there like
I'm not getting a content or anything
I'm just ended gonna go with my bags and
that's that I'm going to be giving away
95% of my makeup
at some point I don't know if we're
going to do in like a video form or
Instagram form that we know what you
think the best way is I'm thinking about
donating about 50% of it to the Women's
Refuge and then the other 50% to you
guys and there's so much makeup like
when I say 95% my makeup I mean like I
can't fit all in one room like it
there's so much makeup it's ridiculous
because unfortunately I can't take all
the makeup with me I kind of take the
things I really really really really
love which is still I give to my
comments do also I am going to sell my
car so just going to put it out there if
you're in Australia and you want to buy
a Jeep Wrangler which is hardly done any
commoners at all and it's brand spanking
new and beautiful you know what about me
when I do set up the UM the car sales
thing whatever for the car I will leave
a link on my Instagram so make sure you
follow my Instagram because you can buy
my car of me because I need to actually
remove you know how it is as you can
imagine this is just like absolutely
crazy insane so exciting and lots of ups
and downs with moving unfortunate I'm
going to miss my family here so much and
I am going to come back twice already
know twice or three times in the next
year so that's fine
so I'll be back and forth England and
Australia still for a little while so
it's not like I'm leaving forever
anything like that it's just like
leaving for now I want to vlog the
entire living process let me know if
you'd like to see that personally I love
watching people's moving vlog so me
packing up all my stuff leaving
Australia heading to England showing you
my new house showing you all that kind
of stuff I haven't got a place yet by
the way working on that if you'd like to
see all that like as like a full series
of me moving to England then let me know
in the comments because I'd love to to
do that because it'd be great thing to
document and also document for my
parents so I can see how I'm getting on
as well so be me and beanie in a little
house having a new adventure and I'm so
incredibly excited I can't wait to take
you guys along with me and to all my
English subscribers I can't like to meet
you when I'm living over there as well I
guess
we want to do a lot of meetups and stuff
in England it would be so much fun that
is pretty much it if you haven't seen my
last few videos I will leave them a
linked here up for you if you like to go
and click on them but it's not next time
