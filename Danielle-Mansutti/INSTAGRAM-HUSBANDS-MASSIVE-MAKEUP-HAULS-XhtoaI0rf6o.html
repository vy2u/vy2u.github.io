master ox powder and this pretty vulgar
brand I thought so good I'm going to try
that okay there's a little bit of damage
a little bit I'm going to bikini top
from hmm and then a denim skirt for
about 31 from Sephora
but you guys probably the way
interesting but some things that I
really needed I'm so sad because they
didn't have Bernards face powder
I'm not sure that's to continue it or
not but got my favorite primer which is
the cap on the locket one then I got the
Urban Decay all nighter in 4.5 I have
this palette which I love which is the
pretty bag of pretty birdy eyeshadow
palette I got this free roll - because
of them seeing quite a frequent - for
Eva I really like it's just so colorful
and pretty so back my pajamas again
we're going to edit this vlog and we're
going to chill on tonight because rest
bit jet-lagged retired and stuff but
I'll show you what I got from hourglass
this first one is the hourglass palette
in graphite which is an eyeshadow
palette miss ghost absolutely incredible
this I absolutely love it is the
hourglass blush brush and I cannot even
explain to you guys like how soft the
bristles are then this is the primer
serum and entire is obsessive the send
like it actually smells so good it
smells like a massage and it is so nice
and we've been snipping our hands all
day because we put on a hand
it's so nice I can't try this one and
then of course the hourglass veil primer
believe it or not I've never tried this
even though it's like an absolute staple
on YouTube next is this stick foundation
in the color beige and it looks super
dark but it matches my turn really well
I got it color match to me today and one
thing that I'm really loving about all
the hourglass products is the packaging
so when I shake picture my hands like
this seriously packaging is so sleek and
feminine and like luxurious and love it
perhaps wasn't a lot to show you how
beautiful this is this is the ambient
lighting powder in dim light which they
said is their most popular shade it just
works for everyone and I tried that and
loved it I've only tried the radiant one
so very excited for this it is like a
setting powder for the whole face and it
just makes you glow this is the Electra
blush that you guys saw me rave about
before
it's so beautiful like all day I just
looking at Ali because she's wearing as
well just so glowy and like Oh pink and
plushy and bronze it's really really
pretty and last but not least is the
ambient strobe alerting powder in
euphoric it is gorgeous it's like a
little version of a highlighter and I'll
swatch it for you quickly so that's what
it looks like on the skin on so that is
the massive hourglass haul which I'm so
excited to try Jeff they're going to
wear all that to the event as well and
it's really nice because they gave us
like full descriptions of all their
products today because I really tried a
few of them tiles I tried a few of them

like everything about the products and
actually like hands on like hello like
