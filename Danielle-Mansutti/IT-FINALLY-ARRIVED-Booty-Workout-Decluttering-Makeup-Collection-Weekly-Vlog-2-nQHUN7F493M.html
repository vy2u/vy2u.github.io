clothing delivery that arrived yesterday
full of goodies for the mouldings next
week so I ordered it all myself
let me grab the box so I ordered all
this stuff off miss Pat bought all of my
own money spent hundreds and hundreds of
pounds I've actually never tried miss
Pat before but I really like this stuff
so I'll give you a quick overview of
what I got so first thing is this
bodysuit which should be so nice of
jeans and I find with like rubes
material like it makes your boobs look
so big as well so that is the first one
these shorts are next and I'm hoping
that I actually fit they do look really
little to me the next I have a tracksuit
set so it cop top and trackies this is a
little prettier shirt which is gangster
number I absolutely love that this top I
am loving this looks so good with those
white shorts from before it's a crop top
it's actually a lot more green than it
is coming up on camera they like it have
another tracksuit set next with this
kind of style okay these are amazing you
cuz I'm holding it out with one hand but
these are like some red flowy trousers
like they're just so pretty oh my god
and then this is a really pretty set I
have a feeling this is definitely gonna
be a Maltese outfit and then picked up
this velvet crop as well which is very
very north and then finally I have this
body suit which is absolutely to die for
but I need to figure out a way for my
nips not to come through because they
definitely will
hello hi good morning it is time for dam
swear to god this like the one-piece
exact weather actually we're to Jim it's
insane like I need to buy more active
with this chop was from TK Maxx it's
just like a New Balance sports bra and
then these leggings are from Primark
which I love because they actually they
give that illusion that you have a
bottom and it's fantastic there was
gonna go ahead and throw on this hoodie
oh but the top so that I don't get too
cold a but I'm gonna try and these today
I'm actually a bit annoyed because
yesterday my gaming computer was
scheduled to arrive and we delivered and
so I pretty much blocked out the whole
day so that I could wait around for it
there's annoying me sorry I think you
touching it so yeah I literally waited
here all day for it and then I got an
email into the dosing we are now gonna
deliver tomorrow for unforeseen
circumstances and what stuff nothing for
God's sake like they give you a window
of 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. and it's like what
normal person has that much free time to
just sit around and wait for delivery
like I have things to do i watch do i
places to go people to see that I can't
just sit around and wait all day for it
and it's just really frustrating but
screw it I want to go to gym I'm not
just gonna sit around and wait for 10
hours for a delivery like if you're a
delivery service give an actual proper
window like it's not an hour just
ridiculous so anyway I'm gonna go train
my legs and had yesterday was a bit of a
short day on the vlog because it was
first day duh and I was just dying on
the couch with a water bottle I was like
with the watermelon with a water bottle
I was dying so I'm not feeling like a
hundred percent today I'm still Kranthi
I'm still hormonal so I'm just gonna
have to do what I can do today I'll film
some bits Jim just so my phone to the
quality will be a bit like yeah but
you'll see what I'm doing today and then
hopefully when I get home they haven't
tried to deliver
it already because that we're really
annoying because it's thousands and
thousands thousands pounds it's just
annoying if I miss it and I will sit
here and I will declutter and organize
my makeup on camera for you because it's
something that I keep putting off but I
think it'd be really like good to don't
camera so we'll do that that's a jib
town let's go
this woody girl
it's just returned from gym it's
actually pretty good session and I
watched some of the clips back to stand
myself and it's so ugly like the
squeezing thing that I have to do but it
really helps you glutes like honestly it
actually does really help he's like my
delivery hasn't actually come yet thank
God so I'm gonna wait a little bit
longer for that I'm gonna cook up some
chicken and some veggies for like kind
of like a post Jim feed and I'm gonna
have like a carbon meal for dinner I
think you know last night I had tuna and
chips do you honestly feel like I'm my
healthiest and happiest that I've been
in so long and also what is this and
where has this come from I don't even
understand I might even like frying I'm
not counting my macros I'm not tracking
my food or anything it is Tuesday today
and last night I put up my first weekly
vlog which you guys loved you guys
seemed to love it that makes me the
happiest woman in the world because I
find I'm very myself very natural and
bugs I don't really feel like I have to
kind of be a character or anything like
that
and it's just I don't know I really
enjoy making them and I think you can
tell that I really enjoy making them as
well and it's really fun for me to look
back on as well
so wait gulags are definitely going to
be a thing you guys are like 110 percent
like yes I want to see more with you
vlog so let's try and get a lot of 2018
documented and vlog for you cuz they'll
be amazing things is here hello beanie
baby girl I like gorgeous
that didn't yum-yum-yum-yum-yum Baynes
is excited lunch is ready
look what just arrived how is the
computer so big what Roy so the task now
is to build this desk HM something isn't
gonna be big enough for this and set up
everything and they're gorgeous and
aiming to put everything here however I
like I'm pretty sure I injured my back
of Jim so this is gonna be this is Bill
my back is absolutely killing me and um
let's do it let's figure out how I'm
into like assemble is I just remembered
I have to assemble the gaming chair as
well I completely forgot about that all
right
it's funny heavy
I did it I said it ho how cool is that
oh my god but I really screwed up here
because I completely didn't even think
about this a glass nest means you can
see hearing and I hate that like that's
setting up those wise are giving me and
now it is time to build the chair and
it's just making me think of PT five can
you do this so Lou update my chair
actually isn't like bolted improperly I
couldn't get one of the arms on properly
so it could like collapse two seconds I
have no idea so I'm gonna get a wireless
keyboard and a wireless mouse tomorrow I
did fix the wires I've actually taped
them behind there so they're kind of
like out of the way the computers pretty
much done I'm just going to start
downloading a few apps onto the computer
and download you know steam it or do it
everything oh and then face is just
chilling watching me might like a candle
chill and then we're gonna declutter my
makeup hey guys it is Wednesday it's
like 9 a.m. and it is so like dark and
cold and miserable raining outside last
night I did not actually get around to
decluttering because after like building
the desk and everything my back is
killing me like it legitimately killing
me I don't know if it was like the
deadlifts yesterday or it was all the
lifting and building and stuff either
yesterday my lower back is like so so
saw that when I stand up I like I'm
hunched because it's so so so I ended up
just having a warm bath and going to bed
like really early because I just was in
a lot of pain so I'm gonna dig harder
today but today like it's one of those
days where I've got lots of stuff like
piling on top of me and I mean like I
have
lots of work to get through but my
environment and my space right now is a
mess like my house is a mess I have so
much like cardboard packaging downstairs
and like rubbish everywhere and it's
just really frustrating me so first
things first I know what I'm like I'm
like clean environment clean space clean
mind so I have to go for the next few
hours and really deep clean the house
and also do the organizing which are we
doing first and then I'll clean the
house and I'll show you what I mean like
it actually like I've got my washing to
put away I've got like rubbish all over
the floor of just new clothes to like
try on and all that kind of stuff and
then when we kept doing the stairs how
to talk is it it's like not a.m. look at
this look at this mess I've gotta like
find a way to put all of this in my car
go to the tip dispose of it everything's
just like messy then this room is a mess
and then in my kitchen I thought sure
dr. bad but I'm gonna have to like mop
the floors do a deep clean pick up all
the things is poo outside which is gonna
be delightful house is an absolute bomb
site from all that packaging from the
gaming computer yesterday and also just
a pile up of stuff because I haven't had
like a day off like a pub a day off
inside though where I've just woken up
and had nothing to do I suppose I always
kind of feel as before travelling anyway
like everything's kind of piled up so
maybe we should do the decluttering
moves for my lot what is going on
England so if we do the decluttering oh
my god this like isn't Italy okay
hopefully that's an improvement in terms
of lighting so it'll be neatly gonna do
some makeup decluttering oh my god it
needs to so balance basically my aim
today is to
mostly if there's products that I've
never used before not like just give
them away but put them in a pile of like
I need to try this because I haven't
tried it yet I'm such a creature have it
like if I find makeup items that I like
I just wear them all the time and I just
don't switch it up and try the products
so let's do it so this one is just like
extra makeup bag thanks what do we have
here eyes shadow draw
this is like favorite favorite favorite
stuff that I'm 100% key thing this is
stuff which is gonna go and like her I
don't want to throw it away but I don't
use them that often pull out and that's
that I don't think I'll ever use that
part so laid out a little bit with me
but in like I'm oh my god why can I
speak English I actually can't having a
brain fart in like a laid out way so
that I can actually see the pout that I
haven't like dig in and like I want any
things whatever if that make sense I'm
so for powder highlights I'm just gonna
keep in like my reach go to draw a few
over which you can use my code any
thirty four thirty percent off I'm gonna
keep Fanta Beauty champagne pop across
the OG and some our glass strobe lights
I also took my moon dust see I say
highlight back in there as well so in
terms of bronzes my favorite ones
they're all staying are literally
completely forgot that or my actual like
hologram makeup is when he got back is
sitting here so I got heaps more as well
this is to my favorite Oprah's I knew
that wasn't enough I froze like moon to
Safari which I love like a really
beautiful golden highlight and then this
one is blissful I can't forget these bad

concealers and my powders mostly
organizing is done now I'm gonna keep
this productive mode up I'm gonna wash
my brushes like that's when you know
you're having a productive day you
watched your question the exits do the
dishes then it's time to make these nice
and fluffy and why again so all I'm
gonna do is grab a little plate and I'm
using that for my penny butter

enjoy about laughs and now it's time to
mop the floors and back in the house
then I have to get a tip do more dusting
do more vacuuming do more cleaning and I
still such work to do but look like oh I
need to get this anyway
baby
it's time to feel myself so got some
rice which and that to cook up and I've
got some cherry tomatoes and about half
kilo of chicken not look fantastic
because my rice kind of exploited in the
microwave but we have rice mutters and
yeah hey guys it's now a few hours later
actually doing some work things hence
why hold up and I will actually bring
this top tomorrow so I get confused
because we are vit repeating tomorrow
most of my work is now done for the day
so Benny and I are actually gonna head
off to my boyfriend's in a sec oh that
sure still can't get used to saying that
it just sounds so foreign but yeah this
makeup look was really easy and I really
liked it like kind of glittery lids no
lashes but kind of naturally glowy
and nice though big fan I'll probably
recreate this makeup look tomorrow as
well because some are heading to London
for events and stuff as well so I sort
of touch base if you basically it's
being so productive
I see so I've got so much cleaning done
and organizing down and decluttering
done then I've just smashed out a bunch
of work and now I'm gonna head up just
in the boy so it's a good day it's a
very good day and I'm very excited for
tomorrow I'm actually having a
one-on-one with the CEO of hourglass so
I'm pretty much just gonna like meet up
with her which is amazing and then I'm
having a facial which is very exciting
except my neck is so fake turned right
now as you can see like that it's just
ready to go it's ready to be scrubbed
off so I'll probably ask her like do you
want exfoliating my neck without it
so I'll make sure I take a big scarf
because I hope you're gonna walk out
with a white face and an orange neck
device that'll be really hot good
morning everyone
so how much you hadn't to London I just
finished getting ready
I literally have zero idea what to do
with my head stay it's actually such a
mess we're gonna work from there I might
just hide up to be honest because it's
just so messy I killed it last night but
it was like too soft and now it's done
this whatever this is I've got to drive
to say you should get the training but
today is but I was quickly gonna clean
up time for me to get it but I'm
thinking honestly you're like maybe hair
up and glasses because one I have
something on my contact lens that I
can't see put into what is this what is
this
I've no idea right we better change this
is very unusual for me hair up and
glasses there was this person to
understand I feel so naked right now oh
my god so I just got to hourglass and
these are some of the new products
coming out this weekend so when you guys
see this would have just come out on the
weekend and I have to show you these
because they are absolutely stunning can
we just take a moment to appreciate this
formula like oh my god
I'm excited to see this one black in
there wow you can even try
asuka theme and they just got like a
memory
I also show you guys then you brow gel
because week at the brush how cool is
that it makes it so much easier for just
like popping it on your brows and I'm so
so excited to try this tomorrow
I think blogging in a toilet is the best
I was tremendous to feed myself and
about to catch some Italia they are
glass thing went so well I love the team
they're amazing news okay
check out this pretty yeah I look
stunning today
because we have end up with no faces
good we're gonna look very different
okay I understand you're a bit nervous
yes
but you have much freedom so you can see
my skin is looking I mean up so I feel
big below a bit clean a bit cleansed
love it I didn't hurt it was laser and I
was terrified but my god hello it feels
slightly weird to vlog with no makeup on
old but I just had to get on here and
say that facial I had it skin laundry
like it was amazing and all that my
pimples and stuff have like disappeared
this is amazing and virtually amazed
like this is so good
oh I need this bed right now hello guys
we haven't spoken in a little while so I
went and I got my nails done today it
feels really weird to have nails done
and they're actually really long okay
so I got them done all like ombre
sparkly glittery and they're really
really really nice so not used to this
like length oh this is very very like
adventurous for me because as a contact
lens wearer I feel like I should not my
eye colour
it gets very annoying having false
lashes and poking yourself in the eye so
today my boyfriend and one of his
colleagues I guess it's the formal term
have just left I had to do some light
work stuff at my place for some shoot
thing so I've just done that
come on else done picked up some parcels
today I had some stuff from Dior which
is very exciting but I'm so unbelievably
tired and stressed and two days till
maldis I've still got five million
things to do I have to do a post for a
company right now and then I have to
edit this blogger then tomorrow I've
gotta do a whole bunch of stuff I
actually have to buy a new drone and
then pack and then I'm off the Maldives
so everything's kind of happening at
once I had a bit of a freak out last
night on the phone to my boyfriend
meters that you had to calm me down
it's okay daddy I was just you know when
everything all of a sudden just piles up
on you and I think all the traveling I
did yesterday kind of blew my hair I'm
just drag it out literally glue in my
hair long story anyway you just like
calm me down and he said right out to
duelist across it all off so I've been
doing that and I don't know if it's
related to the stress that I'm feeling
right now but I just went in the
bathroom then I was about to take off my
makeup and then I looked in the mirror
and I saw what I believe it was my first
gray hair and it's really directly I'm
what Oh see them really stressed or I'm
just getting old but I found that first
gray hair that was not a great feeling
but I did I know who this vlogs probably
gonna be a pretty long one so I don't
want to you know keep you guys waiting
forever so I am gonna stone off now and
I will see you in my next year when I'm
in the Maldives nice to relax and less
stressed and happy and yeah I can't wait
cannot wait and I can't wait to talk to
you when I'm there I'm gonna have to do
this all the time because I got my nails
done you know how does every shot has to
be like this I hope that you really
enjoyed it because I really enjoyed
thinking it's me
