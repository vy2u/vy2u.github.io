that I talk about this out loud the more
it affects me and the more that it's
around but I guess want to get it out I
get it out and it feels extremely weird
to explain the things that I have been
experiencing and have experienced here
because I understand completely if I had
someone saying there's a belay are you
insane because it doesn't make a lot of
sense at all the things that I
experienced in the last I know since the
service here really is what it's like
really affected me I've had paranormal
experiences in the past I always felt a
presence in my parents house of a little
girl who used to stand outside of my
door and now she was a little girl she
looked like a little girl she was the
form of a child and when I told my
family about how I could feel her
presence around my brother literally
turned to me and said oh does she have
blonde hair and she detained as she wear
this edition wear that and I was just
like yes how do you know that I can't
explain to you how much it blew my mind
that he could describe this this ghost
that I could see perfectly and that
really freaked me out
I've had quite a strange experience
since moving to England when it comes to
things you feel that you can't explain
and they don't make a whole lot of sense
to you now this could be heightened by
the fact that I live alone this could be
heightened by the fact that I'm very
stressed and you know it can play tricks
in your mind like completely you know
except that could be the reason for it
however some things that have happened
don't have an explanation of things that
are beyond my mind playing tricks on me
so I spoke about all this on my Twitter
a few weeks ago I also did a live stream
when I felt like the presence was around
me and it's weird I even put up a photo
and something was coming from that room
in there I feel it a lot from that room
that dark shadow in that room I feel it
was someone there watching and I know
that someone looked into it and they saw
a face in the photo and that freaked me
out which I will obviously show you here
obviously it could just be pixels most
likely is pixels but the face was
exactly the height of the thing that I
could see and it was just very weird
that it happened my experience with all
this started around January this year I
was under a lot of stress and I
experienced my first sleep paralysis it
was awful and something that I honestly
wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy
because it was something which is so
terrifying and so out of your control
that you just you don't know what to do
it was like so it was about 8:00 a.m.
and I woke up and I felt someone had the
hand around my throat and they were
squeezing my neck and I couldn't breathe
and I tried to scream and I couldn't
scream and it felt as if someone had
pinned down my arms and legs to the bed
and they were trying to strangle me to
death
and then I was absolutely terrified and
I started panicking because I thought I
was going to die I looked up and to the
right of my bed looking over at me was
this figure and the figure was about
eight foot a black silhouette no form of
like human shape no phase there any talk
about like literally a shadow looking
over my bed looking at me and almost
enjoying seeing me in the pain and it
was a very aggressive presence and
something which was just so awful that I
honestly thought I was going to die and
it may sound extremely graduated me
saying that but there's no other way of
exciting this fear that it went through
when I experienced
and that figure that entered my life
when I had sleep paralysis has not left
and they didn't exist before I
experienced that but ever since I had
that paranormal experience complete
paralysis this shadow figure has stayed
and it is terrifying because there are
lots of things that this figure does I
can't understand and I can't even begin
to comprehend I see it and it looks at
me and I look at it and it's descriptive
wise it's eight foot tall it's male its
aggressive sometimes it has red eyes so
just these two little red lights and on
its eyes and it just stands in doorways
or hallways and just watches me it
observes me and if I'm like lying on my
bed here it will stand over there in
that doorway behind my actual door and
it will just stand there and it will
observe every now and then it will leave
and go into the lounge which is the room
behind me and then come back again and
that's any way that I can describe it
because you can swear in your life
there's something there it's the same
feeling as when someone is actually
sitting next to you and you can see them
in the core of your eye that's how I
feel all the time at nighttime in this
flat and the presence is here a lot more
than it used to be and it didn't exist
you know if he wants to go but now it's
so frequent that it's really terrifying
and my way of dealing with it is by
being extremely calm and quiet so when I
feel its presence I let you freeze and I
don't ought to do it's like bleach I
react to any confrontation in my life I
freeze and I go into shock
and just literally hearing things that
kind of sound like nails walking on the
floor like when my dog walks on my
kitchen floor I hear like thirty
attempted to do nose on the wall this
way I can't there's no way that I can
explains that sound like a crazy person
but I literally can swear that there's
someone in the lounge or kitchen area
because there are someone walking in
that I can hear them walking in there
and it's not my neighbor from above
walking if I can physically hear it
coming from that room and it's strange
because there's some areas of my flat
that it loves to be in and if some areas
my flat it doesn't go in at all so it
doesn't enter my spare room
it doesn't really enter this room unless
my back is turned but it loves hallways
and it loves the big lounge room now
history on my flat I live in Brighton in
like a very old Victorian flat I believe
this is 1800s 1900s so it is very old
and he must have some kind of history as
well so I'm a little shadow homey only
presents himself when it gets dark so
right now as I'm filming this it is 7:30
p.m. and it's almost dark outside and
this is the time where he reappears he
is not here at all during the day he
lives in the shadows and all that kind
of stuff but it's Richard you know the
way that I feel it but what it's also
quite alarming is that if I'm sitting on
my bed at night and I feel something
over there the weirdest thing is that
quite commonly beans my dog she gets up
and she will stand on the edge of my bed
and start barking and there's nothing
that and that's something which makes it
even worse because I think oh my god she
doesn't bark a lot at anything and when
I was live-streaming on periscope this
to Twitter she did it and she did it
right up there so you guys have seen on
the live stream
I feel like I feel like the time ID did
the live stream it made it worse and I
don't know this video make it worse I
feel like because I spend you know my
whole day in my flat without talking to
anyone that when I do speak out loud if
it's listening to me
now you can hear me acknowledging its
present and then maybe it feels when
powerful because it knows that it has a
power over me and that I'm fearful of it
I don't quite understand but that's
something that could make a lot of sense
I have felt presences in the past but I
haven't felt a presence of aggressive is
this one all my other presences that
I've experienced being ghosts or have
been just observers that there's
something aggressive about this one
which is why it it's just something that
really messes my head there have been
two instances I have felt it touch me
and one quite comment and when I'm lying
in bed and the dogs like on the end of
the bed I'm like here I feel it trying
to like reach out and touch his like the
back of my neck or breathed on the back
of my neck I felt that a lot I feel that
more than anything and it freaks me out
because obviously no jobs coming from
that direction because like the door
windows on the side but I feel lying
here from that side of the room I feel
something reaching it from my neck
another time again same position but I
was facing that way and I had my phone
in my hand and the only way I can expose
to you is I literally felt someone come
over and touch my fingers and when I
felt that my instant thought was it's a
shallow doing it like I accepted it like
that's it he's touching my fingers he's
touching my fingers but I just like
didn't move I just froze and then I felt
this really weird like staticky fuzzy
thing in my eye and then it disappeared
like as if that wasn't supposed to
happen you know when you are sitting
down and you get up really fast and then
your eyes and your brain are just like a
bit of a place of staticky that's what
it felt like when it touched me I get
that weird thing in my eyes as well I'm
sure there's you know an actual
explanation as to why there's a lings
everything but trying to expand it into
words it's very very difficult but I'm
sure you
understand what I mean by that feeling
but I think because my reaction to
everything is quite weak I suppose
because I don't fight the presence I
don't say anything out loud to it I just
accept that it's here maybe that's why I
feel so welcome I'm not too sure so when
I do turn out my life if I do to them I
like because these days about chance to
sleep with my lamp on because it is
affecting me a little bit if I'm lying
in bed the minute the light goes out the
presence goes from over there where it
normally just stands and watch soon the
lights on so like lurks in the shadowy
kind of area and then when the whole
room is a big dark shadow it will come
into my room and that it will stand here
and it will look over me the same way
that it looked over me when I
experienced sleep paralysis so during
the first few hours of trying to sleep
I accept that he is standing right next
to my bed and he's looking over at me
and he's watching me and I don't know
why and I don't quite understand why
anything in the paranormal sense will be
reaching out to me because I don't feel
this is a guardian this is not guarding
up all this is just a very weird
presence it could even be the presence
of someone that used to live here or
built this house and is thinking like
who is this person deserving like me
living in the house or something I'm not
too sure but I don't know it's
unfamiliar to me I haven't experienced a
death of a family member or a death of a
close friend anytime throughout my life
luckily so it's not a grandparent or
anything because all my grandparents
still lives my undergrad panda isn't
alive passed away before I was born
so it's just it's not them because this
thing is like eight foot tall like is
really really really tall somewhat I've
experienced all this I believe she kept
telling myself like you're just crazy
you just stress like don't worry about
it like just like a stupid thing going
on in your head and then I googled it
and then I realized hold on a minute
though so many other people all that has
experience
and we're saying I think I've ever
experienced is when I googled sleep
paralysis and I looked on Google Images
and it was the exact thing that I saw
because I tried to explain to my parents
what I saw but the fact that there was
an image on the internet that other
people have experienced that's when it
all just became very real to me and I
was like oh what is this how the hell do
people know what I saw and I don't know
if that sleep paralysis was an opening
for this presence to enter my life
because the first time that I ever felt
him around he was trying to kill me I
don't understand how he's travelled from
Melbourne Australia to Brighton England
but he is still here and I didn't seem
to super month or so but he said and
when I wake up it's not uncommon for
some things my relative slightly shifted
from where they were the previous night
or like slightly rotated or something
like that and I like planus to you now
it is very strange because I'm just
literally filtering everything that's
gone on my head directly into words to
you so I don't understand like how much
this would make sense because
unfortunately I can't share an actual
feeling with you but my whole response
to him has just been quite weak and
quite accepting but very fearful because
I'm almost so scared of this presence
that I just think if and when done as I
like there's nothing I can do about it
so I am getting my art out of the flat
as soon as possible my lease is up in
December and I'm leaving this place
because there's something about it just
I just don't know I just had it scares
me but the whole way especially he lurks
in there all the time and that have been
times where I walked through him because
he was standing at a doorway and I had
to walk through doorway and he didn't
move and as I walked through him I felt
insanely cold and I got that weird
static in my eye again where
I couldn't see properly camera died then
but I'm back it is really turned off not
saying it's the shadow presence
adjusters like step off now that's my
experience if you have experienced
anything similar to me please tell me
please tell me we did to kind of get rid
of it because I need some help because
this is not a nice thing to live with
and shadow people are aggressive nasty
little creatures and I really hope that
I don't have to live with this thing
around me all the time and I can stop
sleeping with my light on because it is
absolutely half line but thank you for
watching or at the end I really
appreciate that and I'll see you all in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
