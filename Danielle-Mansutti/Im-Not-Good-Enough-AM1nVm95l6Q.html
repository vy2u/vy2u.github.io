today's video we're going to talking
about an issue which affects me a lot
short affects a lot of you guys in the
world as well so today we're having a
one-on-one chat about it I just really
love talking to you guys about issues
and sharing advice and stuff like that
so this is that kind of video and this
video is about not ever feeling good
enough and self-worth in this day and
age we spend so much time scrutinizing
ourselves we spend it so much time over
analyzing I'm thinking and then
overreacting from that as well so much
of our life is spent wasted putting
ourselves down that we don't actually
realize that we are enough we are okay
as we are and there is nothing wrong
with you and it's something which I have
struggled with my entire life people on
YouTube and the online community as soon
as I was open and honest about the fact
that I'm very self-conscious and I felt
I have a lot of self-esteem issues and
they use that as bait to sort of hurt me
and attack me so people will write my
video stuff like it's not obvious how
self-conscious you are and it's so
obvious that you're so insecure which is
such a horrible nasty thing to say
someone who's dealing with issues like I
am I have very low self-esteem and I'm
not afraid to admit that I can admit I
have very low self-esteem just because I
post photos of myself doesn't mean that
I'm super confident because what you see
on social media is not real life social
media is like a show it's like a little
performance that you're playing for the
world but it's not really who you are
it's who you are is who you are in
person the way that you treat people the
way that you are with people the biggest
journey that I'm still going through in
my 20s and probably what we go through
for a lot longer is learning to love
myself a little of Who I am I know there
are qualities that I have which I do
like the fact that I trauma has to be so
friendly to people I try to be really
care
and I'd always put other people first
which is a negative and a positive but
it when it comes to my parents it's very
hard for me to be on a platform with a
million people that scrutinized me or
say things even like your right eye is
bigger than your left eye like what why
are you even noticing that kind of stuff
but I am scrutinized so hard and
everything that I do online so coming
into this YouTube space already having
quite low confidence has been a bit of a
challenge for me having a job where I
sit in my bedroom and talk to a camera
unfortunately it doesn't provide that
social side of things that a lot of jobs
do like normally you go into work and
you meet people and you have colleagues
everything but for me I'm at home when
I'm filming and I'm a Hartmann and
editing but then if I go to an event and
meet other youtubers I love that so much
because we just would like thrive off
each other and everything oh my girls
and my guys out there who are watching
this and know what it's like to be quite
insecure I read this thing about - so
accurate I said when you meet someone
for the first time and you have a slot
machine going in your head of which
personality should I play for this
person it's so accurate unfortunately
the way that we are because we are
insecure we have low self-esteem we sort
of mold ourselves to be a certain person
to impress other people we are never
ourselves because we feel like our self
is not good enough and our self isn't
going to impress someone so we always
pretend to be someone else or pretend to
be loud or we tend to be more confident
in order for people to like us that is
incredibly damaging in the long run
because if this person does want to be
your friend do you really want to keep
up that act for months and months and
years even you need to just be yourself
because people will love you for who you
are all it is is about being completely
100 percent yourself and then someone
will come along please no I'm not saying
you will find someone will come along
into your life who loves you for who you
are loves the way you look when you
frown loves the way you look when you
feel like crap like someone will come
into your life one day it could be when
you're 40 years old it could be when
you're 15 years old it doesn't matter
when it is but it will happen but in the
meantime before that person come
along one thing that we all have to
remember is someone is out there and
they want to write a book about you and
they will admire you so much and love
you so much yet you are waiting around
for that one person it won't send you
text back you know you're chasing that
one person that doesn't care about you
and makes you feel like crap and then
you're the one left feeling rubbish and
you have such low self esteem that you
just accept it like it's just because
I'm this and I'm that therefore that's
why they're ignoring me or that's why
they don't like me because you blame
yourself at the other day they're the
ones to blame because they're not a nice
person at least you can say that you're
a nice person these people that ignore
you and make you feel like crap cannot
say that they're nice people because
they're not please remember in all
relationships and life as well you
should never have to beg someone to
treat you the way that you deserve to be
treated or convince them to treat you
better if they're not treating you
better and you can walk away from them
walk away from them I know it's so hard
to just say that because in your mind
you're like yeah but they're this and
they're that and they do this for me or
do that for me or whatever but they're
not treating you right you know you
can't just keep beating yourself down
and feeling like you are not good enough
someone and then putting up with so much
crap or so much emotional baggage just
because you don't feel worthy of being
treated right
in the real world I'm someone that can't
really make eye contact with people when
I walk around on all this dirt floor I
get so caught up in my mind when I'm
walking around and feel like people are
staring directly at me thinking the
things that I read about myself online
oh my god do they think I'm really ugly
oh my god they're staring at me must be
because of blah blah blah blah blah well
when I do meet someone in person my head
goes into like over try by all these
thoughts like oh my god the way I said
that was so annoying and oh my god they
didn't laugh at that and oh my god like
I just thought going full panic right in
my head and it sucks so bad because you
can't switch it off and it's something
which I don't know how to live with rest
of my life is always feeling like I'm
not good enough for someone or something
I read something the other day
I related to so much and I'm sure many
of you will as well and it's right in
front of me so I'll just really up to
you it says you don't others to be hurt
so you find a way to justify you're
paying for their sake you become a light
burning out for someone else's warmth in
sight a glass half-empty that appears
half-full you become a living breathing
hospital you take in the sick give them
shelter in your mind and your heart and
pray that they don't notice the broken
smile buried underneath laughter that
you have to forcefully tug out of your
throat and you pray that you won't have
to explain that you couldn't take good
enough care of your first patient which
was yourself you do this daily until it
feels like a ritual as commonplace as
brushing your teeth and sooner or later
it is when I read that it hit me so hard
because it made me realize that that's
who I am as a person and I'm someone who
will put aside my issues in my life and
my problems and care so much for someone
else it gives them so much love but I
can't ever give any that love to me and
it's why it's so hard sometimes for me
to just sort of feel like I'm enough and
when it comes to me making YouTube
videos I try to play a little bit of a
character on my own and I'm so much more
like bubbly and lively and happy on the
camera I always feel like the way that I
am people that give soboro angry so
awkwardly I said quiet so it's like
pretend to be someone else sometimes
online to come across is like really
happy and carefree and everything and I
know if I'm getting really quite sad
right now because this is like really
deep stuff to me but I feel like as a
generation we're all way too hard on
ourselves we spend so much time
comparing ourselves to other people and
comparing our lives of people's lives
when in reality their lives that they
portray on social media I do you really
think they're real do you really think
that this girl's body is in Photoshop do
you really think that this
all don't fight every night please never
compare yourself to something you see on
social media because it's not reality
you just can't do it to yourself and for
me like I've been really private this
year but there's been so much going on
my life that you guys know absolutely
nothing about yet I come across as super
happy all the time super bubbly on
Instagram and snapchat and YouTube so in
that sense it's not real you know I'm
not really happy that day as from a
smile for what but like I said I just
don't want to sometimes come across as
being sad because I feel like the more
that I talk about me being sad the more
sad I get I'm slowly learning to love
myself I'm slowly learning to accept
that I'm enough I really want you guys
to understand that as well you choose
how to live your life and if you die
today if you can leave your house today
and get hit by a bus or whatever are you
really going to feel like you've
accomplished what you wanted to
accomplish or did you just go through
life seeking approval from everyone and
trying to impress everyone and try to do
things to everyone but never actually
stopped and thought what do I want out
of life that's something that I totally
just realized not long ago and because I
don't have a script for this video or
anything like I don't really know the
direction of went ahead with it
so I'm sorry if this is a little bit
rambling and confusing but my point I
want to get across to you is that you
are enough you are good enough you are
so unique there is known in the world
who has your personality who likes the
things that you like has the same
talents as you the same hobbies as you
in our world that we've grown up in it's
very different to what our parents have
experienced if you are a similar age to
me parents still experience things like
advertisements and newspaper things and
models that I saw but the way that is
portray to us now is so different and
every single night that you've spent
looking in the mirror wishing your skin
was as smooth as those girls you see on
Instagram wishing that you had a thigh
gap wishing you're but with bigger
wishing your lips were bigger wishing
your nose was smaller I need you to
understand it is completely okay if your
skin is not as smooth as Instagram
models 99% of the time
it's edited anyway so please do not
worry about that you know when it comes
to your weight your stretch marks your
acne your scars they all tell a unique
story about who you are and no one else
has the same ones that you do and they
are just you as a person they're all
very beautiful marks on your body and
you need to learn to love them you need
to learn to say I love my freckles I
love my stretch marks because it shows
that I'm a woman and it shows that I'm
strong all those things that are on your
appearance that you are showing to
others you know when it comes to your
scars and your acne or whatever that
doesn't impact who you are as a person
that is just your little outfit you know
and who you are inside is so much more
important I've met a lot of people in my
life who are extremely confident and
extremely sure of who they are and I
admire them so much I have so much
admiration for girls who are so
unapologetically there we go themselves
just say this is me and if you like me
cool if you don't I don't care that is
amazing I wish we could all be like that
because it would make us so much
stronger and so much happier in our
generation and I feel like it's so sad
to see how many girls hate on other
girls these days instead of empowering
one another all the problems that we
have with our own self-esteem majority
the time actually comes from things that
other girls have said not what guys have
said my entire life I've been bullied
and I still get bullied every single day
online on the websites that you will
know about there's no way of saying that
they don't because they pick apart
everything that I do they comment my
parents all the time they judge me as a
person and they make up lies and rumors
about me and just talk about me all the
time whether it's my YouTube comments my
Instagram comments whether it's online
on these certain websites like it
happens every single day every single
day I'm put down every single day I'm
told I'm ugly every single day I've told
them - awkward I'm too shy I'm too
nervous
I'm just so boring one of them and it
got to a point where I was like wow okay
no one's ever going to love me because I
didn't realize I've so many things wrong
with me at people picking out so many
things that are wrong with me
and the voices that are in my head all
these horrible things that I tell myself
those voices aren't my voice those
voices are the people who have put me
down and bullied my voices they stick in
your mind for so long I need you to
understand if you ever feel like you're
going to put someone down
he's realize the impact it's going to
have on that person first if you like
one of the most important things that we
need to realize as well is that you
should be spending a lot for people who
make you feel good about yourself not
people you feel like you have to impress
and feel like I've judging you you
should spend your time with people who
love you and appreciate you and if you
don't have those people in your life and
go out and find them sitting in your
room like I do a lot but I'm editing and
filming isn't going to solve anything so
I reach out other people all the time
and ask to catch up to get dinners or
good movies or whatever because
otherwise it won't really happen you
know people don't realize that my
schedules are weirdest all over the
place because I have such a unique
strange job the most important thing is
being around people you don't have to
impress because you will never be
yourself and you'll never be happy if
you constantly feel like you have to
impress other people what it does come
to your self-worth and relationships
please hear this from me do not sell for
anyone that you can't be your real self
around it isn't so staying to be like
you can't be yourself in front of
someone or they won't accept you for who
you are by being yourself with them the
more that you love yourself and what
people are going to love you because
they're going to see that you're
confident and you're sure of who you are
people want to be around people who are
like that so the more that you radiate
this confidence and radiate this is who
I am and whatever the more people will
actually accept you then if you are
acting a certain way or not being
yourself to impress them I have a long
way to go my journey for self worth and
realizing but not everything should be
blamed on myself if I get ignored or
something I shouldn't just be like it's
because I'm this and I'm not it's not
it's because they're a crap person not
you I do hope you enjoyed advice style
videos I love filming them because they
are so important to me I try my best not
to get too emotional but I do hope it
helped
at least one of you so I'll see you very
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
