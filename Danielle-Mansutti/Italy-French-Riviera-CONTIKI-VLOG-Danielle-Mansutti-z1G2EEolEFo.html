perfumery funtime Pizza I'm about to go
to Italy for a week but I thought
haven't beat my ass beat but in me
hey guys night we're going to Monaco to
the casino I really pad myself because I
managed to get ready in our cabin which
is like so tiny
very very glamorous so we're going to
just head to the casino now I don't
think I can take photos there but
apparently carly genesee before i forget
tomorrow we are going to go to Venice
and then we're starting our little Italy
trip so that's going to be so super
exciting
welcome to Italy with that precise of
this blast
I'm sweet home
then we're going to the beautiful city
of Venice and going to ride on the
gondolas and get some seafood and a lot
kind of stuff that's going to be awesome
it appears today that runs sort of like
form their own group so I'm just going
to be traveling in Venice by myself but
that's okay it's a shopping yeah it
seems like everyone's formed their own
little friendship groups and it sucks
because I'm always like drifting around
the groups but I don't know I think it
certainly mind doing it over myself but
the thing is is that at the moment
I'm really like lonely and I keep like
getting scared and turning off or
vlogging camera yeah I just really kind
of like commonly find the proper group
now and it's been this is the second
week and I still can't find a good group
the people that always wearing it with
me so we'll see how we go but I'm going
to keep trying to be friendly and stuff
but yeah it's a little bit high
you
you
you
quite homesick and a little bit down
because of situations like today one
know I really wanted to hang out with me
but luckily a few girls walked past when
I saw I was a restaurant by myself and
they came in and they were like oh hey
like we saw you eating by yourself so
that was nice
the monthly check pays up so many
tourists I can't even deal and I push in
through you but you're really on this
bad boy yeah it's really small in a
person
this is the closest thing I've ever seen
which looks sort of like my name
that was quite easily the most traumatic
bus ride of my life we were meant to get
here at 5:00 and it's now 7:00 we didn't
have our normal bus driver and we had a
temporary bus driver and we went around
in circles and you can see how excited
we are to be here yeah he's supposed to
punch alright you can put we're gonna go
do some karaoke tonight and drink away
our sorrows because my god we are
exhausted my voice is breaking and we're
going to be doing karaoke
come on
Mylene today we're exploring Florence
which is going to be so beautiful we
went in there a little bit last night
for karaoke bar and I'm committing the
evil sin of outfit repeating so I'm
wearing this thing that I wore last
night once again today so we're going to
be just wandering around the city and
exploring and then tonight we're going
to go to the Space discotheque or
something this is my Geordie Shore wind
which will should be hilarious so
hopefully my camera doesn't die guys I
forgot to charge it last night I have no
time to do it
we just went to the most amazing gelato
fight ever
I've got peach and Mars bar Sally's got
coconut coconut coconut it's so good
I don't know
so we're now going to eat more food at a
Tuscan dinner and then we're going to
space discotheque to get our groove on
which is going to be so much fun
we went to a restaurant down that street
over there and the waiter said that
drinks would will my drink free someone
was paying for it anyway
16 years later plus a $70
service charge me I don't know just
don't go there please guys don't good
he's our next fabulous cabin it smells
like old people in here these dings it's
big though it's the biggest cabin that
we've had so far
so yeah cool I'm currently too scared to
go to the toilet because there's bloody
insects everywhere and um yeah I don't
know it's still my god oh my god it's
actually so sighs I'm so so gross in
here oh my god this just ends eggs
everywhere what do I do
good morning guys so it is now the day
after today we're going to go and
explore Rome which should be so
beautiful
and I'm really excited to do it just to
explain what happened last night so we
went down a back street and there's all
these restaurants people like pest you
to come in and they're just running down
the street asking you to come in and we
decided to do it which probably was the
worst decision ever
anyway we sat down and then I was with
five other girls and they all ordered
spirits they ordered some alcoholic
drinks I didn't have enough money for
that so I we just said five of that and
he goes oh why are you not having a
drink and I said I don't have any money
I'm really sorry goes all my friend over
there is gonna pay it for it for you and
I was like oh yeah thank you
so I said so it's free and it goes yeah
yeah it's free for you it's free and I
was okay cool
then we get the bill back for 70 euros
he charged each drink ten years each
where it should have been four and then
charged a 10-year service fee because
once I said you told me it was free I
wouldn't have ordered it if it wasn't
free he starts going um oh I said that
as a joke I didn't really mean it that
was a joke and I'm like oh my god I need
returns he couldn't speak English and
then it just went like woo so that's all
sex I hate there so we're going to go to
Rome um and my arms getting really saw
so I will off to Rome now I hope that
you guys enjoy this is my last city in
Italy before I go to Greece
so Rome was an experience
we finally got in after an hour and a
half on the train and so proud of myself
for actually finding how to get there on
the train and then we got into Rome
we're on the Metro and my friend she
wanted got her wallet stolen by like an
8 year old girl at 12 year old they saw
all her money and then we went to go to
there from the Trevi fat and I believe
it's cold but it had no water in it and
it had scaffolding all over it so that
was also awesome so I went out back at
the campsite where absolutely exhausted
I'm looking a bit burnt and it's time
for some of these we're having a party
tonight because half of our group are
leaving Toro so yeah
I'm exhausted I'm ready for a break and
gray seriously
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
