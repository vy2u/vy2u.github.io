in today's video I'm doing my June
favorites I have not done a favorites
video in so long I actually don't
remember the last time I did one was so
jumping straight into it so one of our
absolute obsessions which I fall in love
with recently and I showed you on
snapchat the first time I tried this and
I was like obsessed is the center pay
dark self tanning spray I am so in love
with this bad boy I love the color that
it gives me the only problem is that I
didn't actually have the right kind of
makeup to suit this tan I have found
that if you wear this dark tan the Too
Faced Born This Way Foundation in the
shade sand it's perfect like it's so
good together I have used about two
bottles of these I've got one sent to my
PR company and then I bought another one
and I'm really out like I use it all the
time I love it I fall in love with
sprays again I was using phones for so
long but now I'm back in love with the
sprays and the color is like this kind
of color I love it so much next probably
the most beautiful perfume packaging
you'll ever see in your life this is
Valentina and it is so beautiful I
absolutely love it and I was using it
first of all just sort of like in the
background on display and everything but
I actually started wearing it probably
like a perfume should be worn but I
really love it and every time I've worn
this person people always ask what I'm
wearing it's a very unique scent and I
would definitely recommend that if you
are anywhere near so I'll it sells us to
go and smell it because it's beautiful
so this next item was recently sent to
me and I tried it out as I did with
everything that sent to me and can I
just say I fell in love so fast I've
actually heard about this product a lot
on YouTube and I'm so happy to finally I
should get my hands on it and they are
foxy locks extensions I got some 24 inch
extensions in the shade honey spice
ombre ombre ombre is that it and there
are these bad boys right here they are
so soft they're so beautiful and they're
so high-quality
is literally like no better feeling they
brand-new extensions oh my god so soft
as you can see the blonde matches my
hair absolutely perfectly they would
bang on with the color selection as well
and I love the fact that came with all
the wax on as well like all the little
clips on the West it is the most
frustrating thing to have to sew on your
own because I'm too extension so when
they came with the more neon I was like
well yes even though I do have long hair
now the reasons why I wouldn't use
extensions is to stuff like thickening
up a ponytail
we're just thickening up my hair in
general for like a crazy hair style I
would really love to use this in a
hairstyle tutorial or something like
that because I feel like I could you've
been being like ariana grande hair or
something really fun like that with
these extensions so if you would like to
see that then please let me know because
I'd love to do sort of like extension
hairstyle tutorials as well my next
favorites I have used about four times
this month and I can say every time I'm
used it I've fallen more and more in
love with it however I have to quickly
add these are very pricey they're very
expensive and in my opinion it's too
worth it this is the a llama cleanser I
had heard amazing things about this
cleanser for such a long time and I'm
like yeah right it's just the cleanser
what's it gonna do so if you said about
4 times or so you can see the muddy
finger marks there and basically it is a
cleanser but it is also an exfoliant on
your skin so simply I use my micellar
waters to get off my makeup and then I
put on the Elan cleanser afterwards I
rub it all into my skin and it smells
really good as well you can feel
exfoliating your skin which I love just
being able to feel that sensation and
then after that I'll get a warm cloth
and I rub off everything and honestly
you know that feeling you get when you
just feel so clean and so refreshed I've
never used the cleanser before which has
made me feel as clean and fresh this is
a mess not to mention of course I'm just
telling you that it is very expensive
and personally I would go out and buy
another tub with my own money because
it's worth it in my opinion my skin
looks kind of reddish after I use it but
that's not like a bad thing so - right
it's just so clean and so straight back
from all the dirt that was on it that it
just feels amazing like where you make
it feels amazing but how amazing is it
feel when you take off your makeup it is
like the best feeling in the world and
following on from the cleanser this is
the eve Lama brightening that lotion and
I use this after I use the cleanser
initially I just want to try the
cleanser but Mac will really lovely and
sent me this as well it's extremely
watery extremely liquidy it's not it at
all so once you put in your thing is
just runs everywhere but it makes my
skin feel extremely refreshed extremely
clean and it is the perfect little geoo
to go along with the cleanser so if
you're looking into really expensive
skincare but you really want something
that works I would definitely recommend
this brand Elom I believe it is prompt
Elom I could retain that completely
wrong the whole time but let's hope I
wasn't so basically I really love it I'm
really obsessed with it but it is very
pricey so totally your choice you want
to try it or not but in my opinion it
works so well for me so if you have
normal skin like I do I have no it's dry
skin so as you guys know I have a little
be store called an EPT calm and I sell
eyelashes on their called I spy I
normally am obsessed with the lunar
lashes the flirt lashes glam smitten and
admirer I think I might go to favorites
but recently I went clubbing and I Ward
these lashes these are the midnight
styles I put these on and completely
came back to me as to why I stopped
these in the first place I don't know
why I didn't win midnight that much in
tutorials and stuff like that I think
it's because much tours weren't too
traumatic or anything but I wore this
with a smoky eye and can I just say I
got the most compliments I've ever
gotten from eye makeup when I wore these
midnight lashes they make your eyes look
so big and so open and they're just so
beautiful so here's how they look on the
tray and they're extremely just like
feminine and being and fold and crazy
and I love them they work really really
really well for sort of like dramatic
events like clubbing parties hormones
night out whatever I'm circling around
and I'm still in love with these I'm
taking
I'm packing right now so I like putting
that in my little around case but
seriously midnight lashes next I have
the Too Faced cocoa contour palette this
is definitely not a new product this has
been out for quite a while and a lot of
my friends have used for a long time but
I never really used it for some reason
it wasn't until I did the animal cruelty
free everyday makeup tutorial
a few weeks figure now I use this and
I'm like this is not muddy at all so I
was using the lorac Pro palette
previously and before that I was evenly
asked as it barely Hills contour kit but
now I'm hooked on the cocoa got into a
kit because in my opinion it is the most
blendable contour kit that I've used and
I also really love a really brush that
comes with a contour kit so as you can
see my little contour line I'd do it
with the brush and I use the shade
medium maca first and then I darken it
with deep water on top next is another
skincare product this is a non skincare
product this is the aqua gel a luminous
oil-free moisturizer so the story behind
this one is that I went to New York I've
had a month ago two months ago and I was
really lucky to actually go to the nas
store and the makeup artists use this
moisturizer on my skin before we got sub
into the makeup and I looked in the
mirror and I'm just like wow like what
did you do to my skin looks so cool
things like I used this mister eyes and
a life can i buy that because that is
also just got the super sunny in here
didn't it trying to fix that it sorry
yeah I was looking in the mirror and I
was just like shocked because my skin
never looks so luminous and so glowy
it's just I don't know how to describe
it I'm trying to go descriptive words
I'm like it just looks really good but
basically it makes your skin look glowy
it makes you look like you just drank 10
litres of water and you're so healthy
but the best game in the world rush
you're getting preload it now so I need
to go get some more but seriously oh
good but those were all my favourites of
June I really have
guys enjoyed this video and trust me I'm
obsessed with every single nut products
I showed you you like to start genuinely
in love so I hope you guys enjoyed it
and I'll see you all very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
