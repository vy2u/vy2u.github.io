today I finally have another favorites
video it has been too long since home
lasted a favorites video I have so many
things to share with you guys and I have
apps makeup and books you guys know I
love my book this is how I go to some
books and it's one as well I think we
should just jump straight into it the
the first thing we're going to talk
about today is this baby this is the
love Hallett by Too Faced and I created
this look today using this palette I did
film it so that store will be up soon
and so this is part of the Too Faced all
autumn 2015 collection I believe so the
power actually has a lot of shimmery
shades there aren't that many maps but
I'm a girl who loves her shimmers so
that doesn't really matter for me and
there's a lot of different color range
as well when I first opened the palette
I was a little bit like I don't know I
thought the Too Faced chocolate bar
palette looks more appealing but from
using this palette it is so pigmented
and it's so nice I just I can't praise
it enough it's amazing and it actually
comes with an eye liner which is quite
unusual these days because parts are
normally not generous enough to give you
Islanders anymore so that's really cool
this has 15 different eyeshadows in it
I'm absolutely obsessed I mean I cannot
recommend it enough it is such a massive
favorite of line right now my next
favorite is a lipstick now this has just
been my winter go-to product I'm
absolutely loving this lipstick so much
and it is diva by Mac now look at that
it is so gorgeous it's such a gorgeous
color I'm absolutely loving this I
bought this in duty-free in Athens on my
way home from Europe and I've absolutely
fall in love a bit I wore this in my Too
Faced Born This Way Foundation review
video and
so many of you guys left really cute
comments thank you I'm going to show you
once again just to show you how much I
love it
it's such a perfect color for like
autumn winter so I'm in love next you
may already see me review this product
but the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation is amazing I love this
foundation so much it isn't actually
claimed to be long-lasting but it is so
elastic and this is so natural looking
for my skin when I did my to face review
sorry my first impressions were review
of the two basic foundation yeah I was
blown away I didn't expect it to be this
good because I've never had another
two-faced foundation product I don't
really have anything to compare it to
but after trying it out I've just been
using it so much since then so now that
I have my tunnel again I'm in the shade
of sand and yeah also I have no idea
what's going on with my hair right now
if you follow me on snapchat you would
say yeah my long story about how my hair
is just not behaving so I could both
middle parting it and all that kind of
stuff so we're gonna live with this
ratty messy side parting thing we have
going on so next I have this NYX soft
matte lip cream this is in the shade
Copenhagen I believe I'm oh my god I'm
in love with this seriously I'll swatch
it for you right now and you'll be like
what it is actually beautiful I love
this shade I don't know why but I just
first and then because we're in winter
in Australia like anything dark I've
been loving black background loving the
dock the next thing I want to share with
you guys is a book now this book is a
very dark and disturbing so if you okay
that kind of stuff then go for it
I only recently discovered the books app
on my phone you know the one that comes
with phone anyway I've been loving
reading books on my phone and the one
book which I have to recommend to you
guys because I'm
like two prizes away from finishing doc
places by Gillian Flynn that one sitting
there at the top leg huh yeah there you
can I had my chance by the way
oh this was like I have to rate it
because Cara Delevingne
okay the love of my life is in the movie
but I didn't like the book at all ooh
why to like boring I thought but anyway
dark places my Gillian Flynn is one of
the best one of the best books that I
have read in so long I got so into that
book and it's so different for me to
read like more of a thriller like a more
heart book it is very dark and it's all
about you know gory stuff I guess I know
you guys loved and I recommended I
recommend two books to you guys so far I
know you guys have loved that so that is
what I've been reading at the moment so
if you read it or you want to read it
then please let me know so we can
exchange notes about the book so Gillian
Flynn also wrote gone girl I'm sure many
give you seen the movie or read the book
and trust me it's just amazing this
before I get into my next favorite I
like to just dis gaem to you guys that
this is a sponsored mention this company
and I were talking for a while and they
let me know who they are and what
they're about and all kind of stuff and
I've ended up loving their service so
much that I wanted to actually cut it in
my favorites video what we're going to
talk about is really tell me not and
real tell me not is a lifesaver okay if
you're anything like me you will
literally walk into a shopping center
and walk the whole way around the
shopping center just to find the
cheapest thing like I'll go and be like
I really really really really really
want a plain white t-shirt and then I'll
go into like 50 stores and then go into
the store the truth is I want to walk
out I'm really like loose with my money
I'm a huge coupon saver as well I will
always keep my payments for painters
that's the most important thing in the
whole world and I always make sure that
on the back of receipt so you get a
cause and staff to actually look because
they always have
coupons on there as well the thing is
their coupons as I'm sure many of you
know are so hard to keep track of
I have lost that's many free pepperoni
pizzas because of my coupons just go
everywhere and I can never find them
again so Rita Lee not let me know who
they are basically a app for coupons and
when I found that out I was like damn
where have you been it was hard
it's an app which gives you coupons to
hundreds of websites so in the US you
guys have nots Tom and Anne Tyler and
all that kind of stuff they cover all
that the app is for us but I've been
using it on the website because they're
australian coupons on the website so
there's an app on your phone which is
really easy to download and real tell me
not to have given me a cool little
coupon to share with you guys so you can
save some money get some coupons and
find some bargains so for my lovely
american viewers text only two four to
seven six seven for the app and for my
lovely aussie viewers just jump onto the
RetailMeNot website to grab coupons of
that way so even some stores are
specific to Australia only so it's not
just a u.s. thing or anything like that
it's so easy guys just check my
description for more info and I hope you
don't mind my little announcement about
them but I really really really really
love them and I hope you guys love using
their service as well
my next favorite has been a bit of a
life changer um let's just say that my
inner Kylie Jenner has finally come out
of her shell because of this product
okay the Mac lip liner in spice this is
so good the color of this is so perfect
for my lips I only been using like
cheapy lip liners before this but since
I've been using this I'm like wow that
actually is a huge quality difference
between high end and drugstore lip
liners so the spice lip liner is like my
go-to lip liner for natural lips or I
use it before velvet teddy it works
really well really really really really
well without Teddy and I've absolutely
fallen in love with it and now we're
gonna move on to something which just
shows that Dani immense Unni has lived
under a rock for quite a long time
because I've only just recently bought
my first for okay I do not know if this
is
only thing I think it is a pretty sure
it is Porto is like oh why have I not
found this so you know does anyone else
love for for because I have just my lips
is so much better now so much better no
more crack lips I've been loving this
stuff so much so just an appointment I'm
just like wow Danny you're 20 you're in
Australia and you've just bought your
first ball for so yeah I'm sure many of
you are these will agree with me it's so
good guys wow so I had to put in my
favorite it's kind of embarrassing that
I'm kind of late but next I have a Too
Faced bronzer in the shade Sun bunny I
have been absolutely loving this it's so
luminous and it's so gorgeous I love
this bronzer it's so beautiful that's
like a bronze a bit with a shimmer and a
highlight don't really know what to do
my hand right now but you know I also
love the mirror I've been actually using
the mirror for my makeup application
into tourists and we're so big and I
find that this bronze is really natural
as well it's not too harsh the dark
chocolate Soleil and then the milk
chocolate silly bronzes are a little bit
too harsh for me but I've been loving
this shade which I'm wearing today and
last but certainly not least we have
some a color pop eyeshadows now I have a
massive order of $200 with a color pop
cosmetics we do want to see color pop
