in today's video I have my huge L I hope
to share with you I'm also doing an
amazing huge giveaway which I'm going to
be showing the at the end of this video
so make sure you watch all the way to
the end to get the details of how to
enter that and win all of this stuff and
without further ado let's jump into it
firstly we have a blush and we have a
bronzer these are from Too Faced and we
just take a moment to admire their
packaging once again it is absolutely
beautiful the bronzer looks like this
and the blush is like this it's
absolutely gorgeous I use the bronzer
today and I want to stick I was like in
love I am going to be running through
these products is very fast guidance we
get this so many talked about all the
two-faced products you're gonna see
today I picked up at the two things HQ
they were lovely enough to give me a
bunch of goodies there's a lot of Too
Faced in here today the next product is
on my eyes today it is the Urban Decay X
X by some limited edition reloaded
palette seriously though just take a
look at this palette it is insane it's
so beautiful that I saw what many
colored Zoe's a bunch of Blues I also
use this very warm shade here to create
my eye look and I did film it so will be
coming very soon I promise
and if you follow me on instagram over
to see a few days ago I did a swatch
photo of the palette and I was just so
impressed if you don't follow me on
Instagram you should follow me on
Instagram next we have a bunch of new
Too Faced eyeliners I love these because
they have sayings on the sides that the
owner Jared says himself this one is
called mermaids don't cry and then we
have put it in the burn book and then
she told little white lies I'm that kind
of girl I love this one more magical
than a unicorn
this one says soccer players are hot
this brown one is called chocolate chip
honey dip you're so two-faced to glam to
give a damn let them be jealous
be a flamingo and finally never dim your
life this
that she Larry said because when they
were showing me this human there said it
was called dim your light and I was like
oh my good when you swatch them they are
so pigmented especially the white one
because it is so hard
whoa it is so I define a white eyeliner
which is pigmented so for example let's
have a look at the white one and see how
it is so that it's pretty insane for a
white Island to be like whoa next we
have these two Tarte products now these
came in the goodie bags from Manny and
Patricks one-million party this first
one is the rainforest of the sea it's a
primer it's a setting spray
it's a hydrating mist and a skin
refresher so I can't wait to try this
one out
and this aline is a deep dive cleansing
gel tight packaging is so beautiful it
is actually so cute I love how peachy
and my children all the packaging is it
just makes me want to get like the whole
range I really really really love their
products they're awesome
next we have the Too Faced cocoa contour
palette I try to be yellow shades day
which is coconut butter and loved it
it's exactly like the Anastasio banana
shade as well it smells like chocolate I
was so excited about this product this
is the Too Faced better than sex mascara
in the waterproof edition I'm so excited
about this cuz now I can cry wearing my
thousand sixes
I love that Too Faced have made a
waterproof version of better than sex
mascara because it is more like all-time
favorites and personally I feel like
waterproof mascaras hold the curl better
and your lashes I don't know if that's
true that's just me being weird but I
definitely think that they hold curls
better next I have this jeffree star a
liquid lipstick this is in the shade
Gemini I have not yet tried this but the
let's go ahead and watch it
put a pinky brown shade nude I really
like that it kind of looks a bit like
velvet Teddy's me but not as brown so
that's really exciting
I've heard that Geoffrey style liquid
lipsticks their formulas are so rude and
the ones are really
well I've used the red one back when I
was at Shannon's house so long ago I
used the red one and I like this is
amazing so I'm super excited to try out
a new shade now as you guys saw last
week when I did this tutorial with this
it is the true face sweet peach palette
this is the most gorgeous palette I
think I own I want to just keep it on my
dressing table because it's so cute it
smells so good oh my god I wish you guys
could smell it so bad I was very very
very impressed this part when I used it
I found that the pigmentation was great
the color palette is great pretty much
the same thing isn't it can't power up
the pigmentation as you can see there
are a range of mattes and shimmers
within the palette which is really good
because then you can create lots of
different looks I really don't like what
a palette is all shimmers or all maps
because then it's like the next thing
that I have are these four smashbox
color correcting Stix
now in complete honesty I do not think
that I'm going to probably use these
sticks these were sent to me and I would
love to give them away to you guys so
they're going to be part of the giveaway
at the end of this hall therefore I'm
not going to open them because it would
be very untidy and by senji leaves but
I'm like squashing them all over my body
so it's color correcting sticks are
obviously used for stuff like fixing
dark under-eye circles and stuff like
that and you guys can get all four of
these if you want to stick around to the
end of the video when I do the whole
full description of the giveaway I'm
just looking down right now I'm like
this is like an altar face I'm really
sorry I didn't do so much shopping in LA
I was very lucky that two-face gave
these to me so I thought in return I'd
love to give them exposure of these
products so now we have a bunch of
two-faced lipsticks as you can see these
are primarily a nude pink and purple the
packaging of these lipsticks are all
black and you can see the Too Faced logo
is there and then on the inside the
lipstick looks like this that is a very
very very nice sort of peachy pinky nude
and that was actually really creamy as
well which is great I once watched a
darker one to see how that looks so this
one is called maneater
let's see what the form is like okay so
that is a very sort of pinky purple
color it is definitely a lot lighter
than it looks in the lipstick I thought
be a lot darker than that but it is
super creamy and I'm liking that
continuing on with Too Faced we have the
peanut butter jelly palette as you can
see I've already dived into this color
and use it a few times so if this shade
in the middle it's gorgeous I use the
other day and I was like I love it
little purple shade here is amazing as
well but the only thing is this palette
doesn't really have much as a smell
which isn't a bit disappointing for
two-faced products that I guess peanut
butter smell things not really one that
I enjoy anyways it's probably a good
thing you can see this jelly shade is
super pretty I'm now going to swatch
this one in the middle which I love it's
called peanut brittle ah check that out
next I have a bunch of Ifrah liquid
lipsticks now I broke as maddux company
that I haven't really used much before
but I actually met with them and got to
know them and they're a family owned
business but I think is so cool and the
people behind over are absolutely
amazing I fell in love with them today
on my lips I'm wearing this one which is
called mocha I think I love the most
about these liquid lipsticks is that
they literally glide on my lips they're
not drying at all that's the biggest
thing with liquid lipstick it's so
annoying when they sink into your lines
like in your lips like I also switched
these lipsticks on my Instagram as well
which you may have seen if you find me I
was so impressed with formula these
liquid lipsticks and they're definitely
something that I'm going to be using a
lot from now on okay now this part is a
little bit crazy because just have a
look at how many lipsticks I'm happy to
show you this is the new top faced
melted Mac's liquefied matte
long-wearing lipstick range as you can
see these are the new and improved
version of the old Too Faced melted Max
this is one of my old ones here and I
had to say I'm really loving the new
bottle design I love it actually a lot
more than the old one when you put it
down can actually stand out does the
full live everywhere look the old ones
awesome so recently I've been wearing
these lip plus a lot because I've got so
much to play with right now that I've
been playing with them since I got home
I love the formula of these liquid
lipsticks because it actually contains
coconut water which helps to hydrate
your lips and not dry them out and crack
them like I said before like liquid
lipsticks normally do so I love that I'm
so happy about that so let's go ahead
and go through the whole range the first
one has the best name ever this I'm
serious
is called lady balls and then we have
Queen B this one is called who is zoom
in her and we have this one which is
called feeling myself and wore this on
the other day and I loved it it is
called evil twin this one is called 1998
and then we have child stuff this is
called mrs. Roper this one matches my
nails
it's called me so pretty here we have
Naughty by Nature this one is Marsha
Marsha Marsha here we have unicorn this
one is on point
I wore this one in my peach pal tutorial
it is sell out this one is cool girl and
finally we have drop dead red next I

because I'm also going to be giving
these away in the giveaway at the end so

one is called glean and you can win both
of these in the giveaway I actually have
doubles of these now it's very lucky to
