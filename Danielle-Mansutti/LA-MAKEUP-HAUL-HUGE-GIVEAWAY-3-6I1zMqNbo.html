in today's video I have my huge li hole
to share with you I'm also doing an
amazing huge giveaway which I'm going to
be showing d at the end of this video so
make sure you watch all the way to the
end to get the details of how to enter
that and win all of this stuff and
without further ado let's jump into it
firstly we have a blush and we have a
bronzer these are from Too Faced and we
just take a moment to admire their
packaging at once again it is absolutely
beautiful the bronzer looks like this
and the blush is like this absolutely
gorgeous I use the bronzer today and I
want to stick I was like in love I am
going to be running through these
products in very fast guidance we get
this so many talk about all the
two-faced products you're going to see
today I picked up at the two things HQ
they were lovely enough to give me a
bunch of goodies there's a lot of
two-faced in here today the next product
is on my eyes today it is the Urban
Decay x.x vice a limited edition
reloaded palette seriously though just
take a look at this palette it is insane
it's so beautiful there are so many
colors is a bunch of blues i also use
this very warm shade here to create my I
look and I did film it so we'll be
coming very soon I promise and if you
follow me on it is to go over to see a
few days ago I did a swatch photo of the
palette and I was just so impressed if
you don't follow me on instagram you
should follow me on Instagram next we
have a bunch of new two-faced eyeliners
I love these because they have sayings
on the sides that the owner jared says
himself this one is called mermaids
don't cry and then we have put it in the
burn book and then she told little white
lies I'm that kind of girl I love this
one more magical than a unicorn this one
says soccer players are hot this brown
one is called chocolate chip honey dip
you're so two-faced to glam to give a
damn let them be jealous be a flamingo
and finally never dim your light this
one
hilariously because when they were
showing me this him i loosen it was
called dim your light and i was like
really oh my god when you swatch them
they are so pigmented especially the
white one because it is so hard whoa it
is so i define a white eyeliner which is
pigmented so for example let's have a
look at the white one and see how
pigmented is so that is pretty insane
for a white island to be like whoa next
we have these two top products now these
came in the goodie bags from Manny and
Patricks 1,000,000 party this first one
is the rainforest of the sea it's a
primer to setting spray to hydrating
mist and a skin refresher so I can't
wait to try this one out and this align
is a deep dive cleansing gel hearts
packaging is so beautiful it is actually
so cute i love how beachy and my
children are more packages and just
makes you want to get like the whole
range i really really really love their
products are awesome next we have the
two-faced coco contour palette I try to
be yellow show today which is cocoa
butter and loved it it's exactly like
the Anastasio banana shade as well it
smells like chocolate I was so excited
about this product this is the Too Faced
better than sex mascara in the
waterproof edition I'm so excited about
this because now I can cry wearing my
better than sex I love that two-faced
have made a waterproof version of better
than sex mascara because it is more like
all-time favorites and personally I feel
like waterproof mascaras hold the curl
better in your lashes I've know if
that's true that's just me being weird
but I definitely think that they hold
curls better next I have this joke we
start a liquid lipstick this is in the
shade Gemini I have not yet tried this
but let's go ahead and watch it sort of
pinky brown shade nude I really like
that it kinda looks a bit like home
velvet teddy to me but not as brown so
that's really exciting I heard that
jeffree star liquid lipsticks the
formulas are so rude and the ones are
really
as well I've used the red one back when
I was at Shannon's house so so long ago
I use the red one and I like this is
amazing so I'm super excited to try out
a new J now as you guys saw last week
when i did this tutorial with this it is
the true face sweet peach perler this is
the most gorgeous palette I think I own
I want to just keep it on my
dressing-table because it's so cute it's
smells so good oh my god I wish you guys
could smell it so bad I was very very
very impressed this part when i use it i
found that the pigmentation was great
the color palette is great pretty much
the same thing isn't it can't pay off
the pigmentation as you can see there
are a range of mats and shimmers with in
the palette which is really good because
then you can create lots of different
looks I really don't like what a palette
is all Schumann's or all max because
then it's like the next thing that I
have are these for Smashbox color
correcting sticks now in complete
honesty I do not think that I'm going to
probably use these sticks these were
sent to me and I would love to give them
away to you guys so they're going to be
part of the giveaway at the end of this
hall therefore i'm not going to open
them because it would be very own idea
if i send you leaves that I'm like
squashing them all over my body so its
color correcting sticks are obviously
used for stuff like fixing dark under
eye circles and stuff like that and you
guys can get all four of these and you
want to stick around the end of the
video when i do the whole full
description of the giveaway i'm just
looking down right now I'm like this is
like all to face I'm really sorry I
didn't do too much shopping in LA I was
very like a tattoo place gave these to
me so I thought in return I love to give
them exposure of these products so now
we have a bunch of two-faced lipsticks
as you can see these are primarily nude
pink and purple the packaging of these
lipsticks are all black and you can see
the two-faced logo is there and then on
the inside the lipstick looks like this
that is a very very very nice sort of
peachy pinky nude that was actually
really creamy as well which is great I
once watched a darker one to see how
that looks so this one is called
man-eater let's see what the formulas
like three okay so that is a very sort
of pinky purple color it is definitely a
lot lighter than it looks in the
lipstick I thought it would be a lot
darker than that but it is super creamy
and I'm liking that continuing on with
Too Faced we have the peanut butter
jelly pellet as you can see I've already
dived into this palette and used in a
few times so if this shake in the middle
it's gorgeous I use the other day and I
was like I love it little pebble shady
here is amazing as well but the only
thing is this part doesn't really have
much as a smell which is a bit
disappointing for to face products that
I guess peanut butter smell isn't really
one that I enjoy anyways it's probably
good thing you can see this jelly shade
is super pretty I'm now going to swatch
this one in the middle which I love it's
cold peanut brittle Oh check that out
next I have a bunch of oprah liquid
lipsticks now over a cosmetic somebody
that I haven't really used much before
but I actually met with them and got to
know them and they're a family owned
business do I think is so cool and the
people behind over absolutely amazing i
fell in love with them today on my lips
I'm wearing this one which is called
maka thing I love the most about these
liquid lipsticks is that they literally
glide on my lips they're not trying at
all that's the biggest thing with liquid
lipsticks it's so annoying when they
sink into your lines like in your lips
local I also swatched these lipsticks on
my Instagram as well which you may have
seen if you will find me I was so
impressed with formula these liquid
lipsticks and they're definitely
something that I'm going to be using a
lot now on okay now this part is a
little bit crazy because just have a
look at how many lipsticks are happy to
show you this is the new to face melted
matt liquefied matt long-wearing
lipstick range as you can see these are
the new and improved version of the old
two-faced and melted max this is one of
my old ones here and i have to say i'm
really loving the new bottle design i
love it actually a lot more than the old
one when you put it down can actually
stand up does the full live everywhere
let the old one
awesome so recently I've been wearing
these lip cause a lot because I've got
so much to play right now that I've been
playing with them heap since i got home
i love the formula of these liquid
lipsticks because it actually contains
coconut water which helps to hydrate
your lips not dry them out and crack
them like i said before like liquid
lipsticks normally do i love that i'm so
happy about that let's go ahead and go
through the whole range the first one
has the best name ever this I'm serious
is called lady balls and then we have
