really waiting for assess of unpacking
and repacking like at the exact same
time so I got back from New York like
two days ago I've only been home like
just this morning and I've just had time
to unpack and then repack my stuff for
LA so I'm actually bloody proud of
myself because look where is the black
obviously explain what I'm wearing right
now because it's a I'm bringing like so
much white so much color because I am
going away with Jay Malone and I am so
beyond excited and so honored to be
going on this trip and they mean so much
to me I'll explain why they please watch
me doing the vlog I'm sure but right now
I'm in the process of packing I am about
to die my eyebrows so I might just think
you guys lonely when I do that and I
have about like 5 million we missed you
parcel things I think so in collegues I
think nine or ten eleven parcels because
I haven't been home in two weeks and I'm
only home like this morning and then at
11:00 I'm gonna go drive up to Nick's
and then get picked up from bed to go to
Heathrow
so no but it's all good so let's go dye
my eyebrows quickly because I know that
they're microblaze are normal but
they're a little bit like can't really
see but my hair color is a bit darker
then here so I just really want to dye
this bit new I'm gonna go pick up the
parcels and then it is off to LA all
right let's do this so I actually have
used the same stuff now like five or six
times and I'm still on the same packet
this is the I'll or eyebrow tint I don't
know before name these are the Chinese
like they're really the focus on this
camera so annoying I use like the two
dark ones basically that's a couple
there we go so I use these two and I
just grab like a little brush to do it
sell her um I like to do this before a
holiday so she before a fly because I
just saved a lot of time when it comes
to the eyebrows so first thing
I have to do is the color cream and then
it's a developer I just uses with an
eyebrow brush instead of like a q-tip I
find it easier and more precise with
this and I'm just gonna like pop it on
my eyebrows exactly how I would fill in
my brows I'll show you this my before
show my art in just a second and tada
my eyebrows are now a teeny tiny bit oh
my god the vergis and now they are
darker and like full and filled in oh
yeah and like so you got it he's now
it's gonna save me a bunch of time
filling in Z brows I am gonna go pick up
these deliveries and not doing a massive
unboxing because it will take too long
in this vlog but I think this is German
line surprising there so I'm very
excited to go and pick them up
