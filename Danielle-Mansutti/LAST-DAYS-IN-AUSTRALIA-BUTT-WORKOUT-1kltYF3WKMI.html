channel today we are vlogging because it
has been quite a while since I've logged
actually and I miss it
so bad I just found an apartment tool
which I believe will probably be up by
the time this is up maybe maybe not i
don't do job today is just like a crazy
workday but i just really really really
feel like because i literally
have like no time left to Julia and I
just kind of feel like I want to show
you the madness which is going on in my
life right now so I'm going to gym soon
it's 11 a.m. now I'm going in about two
hours sorry but I've got to walk the
bean before then anyway except done most
my filming this morning anyway like you
know if that feeling it's honestly like
the worst feeling in the world where you
are wearing a lot of makeup just like I
am right now and you can just feel it
like you just feel the makeup on your
skin in your life just get get off get
off so I think it's best to remove my
makeup now before gym because I don't
really want to go there with all this
going on I just found the inspiration
that I needed to go to gym today
tell me does upload of this photo and
can we just appreciate how beautiful
this woman is I can't I just can't I
can't deal with it I'm like I need to
squat every minutes the rest of my life
like Walt and so hungry and I have a
fridge of a 22 year old serious bun so
it's kind of in between breakfast and
lunch time so let's make a little salad
or something incredibly boring
by the way investing in like a knife
sharpener was like the best idea of my
life I'm so much happy and I wouldn't
make my freedom oh yeah
story of my life so it is gym time now
these leggings ah slinky and my top is a
pajama Toba but I was like I'm just
going to wear it because why not so I'll
give you guys a very quick lesson in 3d
posing okay so here is me normal and
then
host and you can see the big difference
or like that do you really like art to
bum out or your back leg out like this
and you twist your body and it makes you
look like got a boobie
I don't really hurt your lower back at
all but that is like my life you can
enjoy your trait Oh see you like bye
baby
you like I'm filming my folks are
driving me again thank you for loving
that veneer by the way like I have the
most fun and by making that was like
really different really funny coming
eating gum because my breasts drink
after that I'm going to go jump on the
balls oh I'm chilling right now you know
yes a little update about me gym fitness
health everything like that so I'm still
gonna gym like 4 cents a week I'm just
definitely not as intense like I said I
would I guess I'm not really doing
myself any favors because I've been
extremely lazy with my diet as of
recently and I mean like type at this
point where I ate like 14 times 3 to 2
gem-like school this is like a pretty
well kept up you know sugar rush all
that but not seriously I have like
cereal in the mornings and I just like
snack throughout the entire day so I
don't have substantial meals I'm just
eating like crap we're constantly and I
don't really know why I think it's
because I'm so busy at the moment with
the move and coming in videos and
packing and everything that I'm putting
myself I deliver the low priority so I'm
just like not even caring about what I'm
putting into my body which isn't good
and I found it a lot easier to eat
healthier when it was summer because
strawberries and grapes mangoes and
stuff like I would snack on them into
the second sweeper but right now the
only food that's in season is like
apples and mandarins and stuff a little
bit like I mean I could be doing what
but I could be checking my macros I
could be getting in my protein you know
it kind of stuff but I just like I know
I got the motivation a lot and amazing
lots of math sounds well because I'm not
like trying as hard so yeah it's a
little harder just people it's like
really low priority for me now but and I
want to get England as well like the
first few weeks I'm going to be awful
like I know I'm going to be eating crap
food and I'm thinking I'm not going to
be going to geom or anything like that
because I'm going to be like settling in
finding furniture trying to like get by
loose yeah I think yes I'm just going to
expect that I'm going to come a little
bit awake when I move over there and
stop I mean I'm putting on right now
because of my diet okay if I need to
cash it's especially hard when you live
alone to have the motivation to feed
yourself probably probably properly yeah
I find it very hard
why did I myself will cook for myself
sometimes and that's I only want to
contribute like super simple to be easy
