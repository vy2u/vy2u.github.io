yeah I'm back all right kind of sappy a
little bit and if you're not with me on
social media but you probably should
then new you will have no idea where I
was seen what's going on I'm doing a
live updates for you today because I
feel like I do have a lot to update you
want I miss you guys like I seriously
miss you so much I also have a bit of a
company blog footage which I've posted
anywhere which I would use for this
video when cardi was over when I was in
Bali you know that kind of stuff and of
course lots of pug puppy footage - I'll
go back from Bali today and I am filmed
in a long time you might have noticed
that I have known an upload last trees
there last Friday as well and I felt
like it was best to come on Myesha
platformer talk about this because I do
have a little more you should follow us
and then dude Instagram followers and
stuff like that so I know that not all
of you have been informed of what's
going on and changes and what's gonna
stuff there's multiple reasons for that
one of the reasons was that one of my
videos is a sponsored video and I'm
still waiting for it to be flea root and
then I was planning to blog in Bali but
when I got there and I was with Edith my
girlfriends who aren't very used to like
my YouTube well like we never really
talked about YouTube at all that's like
that I'm having quite so that Doris well
might work and I can just be a normal 22
year old I just didn't feel like far my
camera in their faces if I'm not used to
it and it is so much easier at like a
YouTube event with other youtubers
because you're all doing it but I spent
about like gnarly I'm gonna have a
holiday and when I just like experience
with my friends and chill out and not
being worked right so I didn't vlog my
boat trip however I did blog little bits
and pieces that he wanted to remember
because our combination was beautiful
and I want to remember it a personal
reaction it was cool yeah Dylan's in
Seminyak pictures so gorgeous insert the
footage of the villains here we were
just so excited
it's so big and then it was the most
beautiful Balinese Villa ever it was
just stunning and amazing and then our
booking got stuffed up so we pretty much
I'd like no one's safe two days and we
managed to stay at the higher voice and
some yeah
none of the last night we say at Chinese
Remillard
in seven yak which I think were like the
worst amazing those hours are beautiful
there and so nice and modern and I just
wish we could have had extra time there
but there are all these issues with the
booking and it's all a little bit like
I met a lot of you in Bali or just sorry
pool and sir Anderson's like this crazy
slow strange I was finding really weed
when I'm outside of Melbourne and
someone recognizes me I'm like oh this
your age but I mean no try to go as you
recognize me for Melbourne but a lot of
you guys are from New Zealand is also
hello everyone that said hi thank you so
much for saying hi I didn't guess with
anyone because I'm me and I know it
should never get with anyone ever sorry
I love life it's still long existence
still pushing along on that mother
distant train cuckoo and when I was over
there I was brown away sent an email
that I'm going to go to LA in a few days
like what definitely definitely gonna
vlog in LA but only after like two days
and then I fly home it's crazy the
timeline is crazy
going there for an event and coming
straight home but I'm gonna be blogging
at that event because I'm gonna be
around or many of you Chisholm's I am
loving like I can't wait to go back and
I would have extended it but I just need
time with my puppy like she's so small
and I booked my Bali trip before and you
know I was getting her and when I was
away from her I was just like I just
miss her and this is like a crucial time
I don't want to be gardening with her so
I want to spend all time there while I
can so I'm not planning on doing a lot
of traveling for the next few weeks
months today after like but what an
opportunity like the LA one came out I
was like have to go like I can't say no
to that
so other things that have happened in my
world in November is it was my birthday
earlier this month and I've got my puppy
as you will know which is like taking
over my life but I can't believe a part
of less than a mom I feel like I've had
this what
yeah and we have when ya know you want
to just sit and chill out for a bit
oh you got my tight baby boom baby I
absolutely don't her to be that she's
growing up so fast it's insane earlier
on in the month
Katya Milan visit is Melbourne as well
it's just something about paella which I
find so intriguing and I admire her so
much and she's the first person I've met
who's a lot younger than me that I
actually look up to just so gorgeous and
we just sat down in my apartment and we
chatted so long about what's going on
with me and the direction I wanna start
taking my channel in because she did a
similar thing where she's sort of so2
slowing down a little bit on the beauty
videos and opened up more about who she
is and doing this short films and stuff
like that so we're exactly on the same
track
in that sense so we have a visitor today
the mail car that work today is survived
I never wear black and this is so weird
for me I'm wearing like I didn't green
I'm like Melbourne for two days and
she's changed telling you in New Delhi
okay excite me I was coming to see done
you know meeting little pop guys um
beans is like way smaller than you think
yeah from the photos cuz I walked in and
I saw this little like moving thing on
the ground and I think it doesn't rat I
absolutely adore that ghost if you don't
follow her you definitely should because
she's amazing and I love that girl to
bits that is a little brief overview of
this month in terms of events that have
happened but now going to talk about how
I felt about a few things this month so
when I put up my the truth video which I
I was a little bit quick but any title
but it was a very truthful video it
really opened my eyes to how many of you
are following me me and not because it's
makeup and you all know that I am NOT a
makeup artist and I accept five million
hundred times that there are so many
other youtubers that deserve more credit
for makeup then me because half the time
I do not know what I'm doing and I'm
like but I'm definitely figuring out the
direction that I want my child to go
into I feel like right now is such a
confusing time of my life because I have
a million ideas and a million different
paths to start walking down and I'm
literally standing there like not sure
what to do like I'm really leaving my
old life behind at the moment I have
sort of close the door on so many things
and I'm ready to open new doors and
seeing what happens and changes and
stuff like that for my life I don't know
I'm just very confused and I really
really appreciate your patience while
I'm thinking it all out and I appreciate
so much how patient you were with me
when I did go on like early holiday and
did not lie for about a week because I
really just needed time to sort of relax
because I've been on YouTube now for
over two years and there's not been a
single week in two years that's more
like 100 and more than 100 for weeks
where I've uploaded consistently twice a
week and I just needed a week off you
know like we all need to wake up
sometimes and I really do appreciate you
letting me do that I am something to get
to the point now where I kind of feel
like I want to start uploading quality
over quantity like I know I've always
been about to upwards a week I don't
know sometimes I just feel like should I
be churning out videos to fit a schedule
or should I be spending more time on
videos that a better quality in terms of
things like routine videos big short
films and stuff like that it just not be
out learning is often because I would
love to spend like a week on one veneer
and then upload it the next week instead
of like trying to cram in a bunch of
videos for a certain week just to fill
the Tuesday and Friday schedule but I
need to figure that out but I honestly
feel like this year for so many people
has been such like a year change this
thing about college oh the year of
realization would be
you change from anyway a lot of you
choose that I want to kind of slowing
down or changing or whatever as well
like sprinkleofglitter
you may not have the same thing actually
really changed the content
I was watching PewDiePie when he was in
LA I mean just like quick tentative
walking for a few days and of course my
favorite KC nice that is now finished
daily vlogging and I just feel like
there's so many of us that are searching
for something new and stuff which isn't
just over routine and I'm just so ready
for the next chapter of my life to start
because I feel like I've been in such a
rut recently and my depression is really
bad recently there is no cure for
depression
I know helping what makes me depressed
like I get to press the piece of
disconnection I have super single and
yes it does get me down because I would
love to have someone cuddle I would love
to have someone to look like tell
everything in my life to and to feel
like someone loves me but I also need to
realize that I could find that
validation within myself and that's
something I'm trying to learn as well
like I'm still trying to learn self-love
and learning that you know I can give
myself a pat on the back sometimes or I
can treat myself to an ice cream or
whatever if I did something which
deserves a reward of whatever like you
know what I mean I'm very a bit I'll
leave this place right now I think I've
stopped caring so much about a lot of
things that used to really affect me as
well what I actually do not care about
the height anymore I'm just like okay
okay I don't know I just don't care I
literally don't care about hate or abuse
or whatever I just like yeah look
walking around like Oh any books
everything and I'm like oh look just
like hey I don't the time for it I just
don't know it like oh thank you guys so
much for believing in me no matter what
and actually being there for me and like
hey like we're gonna follow you no
matter what because that is so
meaningful to me like to have people in
my life like you but no matter what I've
got I will sit down you're gonna watch
my videos you're gonna support me like
oh it just makes me want to give you
like the biggest squeeze in the world
because I can't thank you enough the
loyalty that you have to me is just
incredible and I love you so much for
that like it's insane in love
I just feel like life is about to give
me a massive kick up the bum and I'm
about to go flying into a new direction
and I'm so ready for it I'm just ready
for change and stuff to put my
experiences into the people and bring it
on
oh yeah that's the arm and just caught
up with all the stuff that's happened
live away and then over YouTube drama
it's like well look the universe spec
now I'm like I'm so glad but I'm just
kind of backing off a little bit from
the beading community in the beauty
world because god it's crazy isn't it
like it's just insane it's just crazy
like the drama and the scrutiny and the
Gotham youtubers and the gossip pages
I'm just like it's so dumb why are we
doing this like let's all be friends and
have a brain but can't cut the girl for
bingos if that is my life updates I
haven't known in so long sorry from a
bit like rusty I am going to fill the
makeup surro next week I have it in my
head that I want to film I am wearing
