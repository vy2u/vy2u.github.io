to hydrate myself before the facial then
looks like I'm going to room 276 getting
a facial and we have about an hour to
get ready and then we have cocktails and
dinner tonight
and I'm very excited you know the most
amazing things like I used to find this
terrified going to an event I don't know
anyone who's here I mean I don't have a
clue I could know anyone
I could no no one I could no some people
have no idea who's coming
but that excites me because I actually
really love meeting new people now and
like that working and stuff but it's
just weird I like pushing myself out of
my comfort zones I'm very excited if
it's not not nervous at all it's very
excited and very excited to learn more
about the brand and see who's here just
checking out the room so yeah I will
have a little drink of water and then
it's off or facial even these hallways
of fancy I swear to god this is nice you
look like an egg right now we're gonna
use the original cleansing jelly that's
the one we're gonna use that to kind of
get off this eyebrows stuff but I'm
gonna be so glowy innocent so excited
I'm looking slightly different now I
just finished getting ready so I've just
done like kind of winged liner and I've
got the hooter Brede desert dusk palette
on and I've also got the downy Beauty
lashes in selfie on today so I am
wearing a place in a second when I'm not
like lying down as cold as killing me I
need to get rid of it let me pause that
okay no sorry I really excited I think I
mentioned before yeah I don't know
anyone I don't think that's gonna be
there tonight
so it is a new opportunity to meet new
people and that makes me very excited
and so weird because I used to get so
nervous and so anxious about these
things but I've kind of trained my brain
into just looking around the room and
thinking everybody is human being were
all equal what's said to be scared of
and I just kind of you know make the
most of being invited to such an amazing
event really with such cool people so I
am looking forward to it and this is
like so me right now I'm on a diet and
next to all the elevators they have like
bowls of chocolates they're all from
like favorites or celebrations with like
bounties and Mars and galaxies and I
just keep running to them and coming
back here but I should we save myself
because you have a dinner in a second
but it does feel so nice to vlog again
I didn't vlog last week I was in
Australia because of family time it's a
little bit inappropriate to vlog for me
it feels that way I don't really like
walking with my family because that's
not work to me that's family time so I
didn't vlog in Australia I was in
Australia it's like five days like that
was it
it was a very quick trip and now I'm
back and yeah
back to vlogging again and this week
I've got a few exciting things this
weekend though I might be going to
Yorkshire to get things back finally
like I wanted to get her back today but
then this event came up but it's an
overnight event and I thought why would
I get her back when she's just gonna
have to be with someone else again so
anyway my auntie who's in Yorkshire has
been so it me and my boyfriend are gonna
go up he's gonna meet her I felt he
remembers the first time which is a
little bit nervous but I think that it
should be fine and then we're gonna go
up so this weekend will be spent in
Yorkshire the rest of this week I have
lots of meetings and events I have an
event on Thursday Victoria Flowerbomb
event it's my favorite have you ever Sam
so excited to going to that and then I
am just doing so much work yesterday I
filmed edited that took all day today
filmed editors took all day lots of work
this week and I kind of feel like after
traveling you really need that time to
just catch up on everything so that's
what I'm doing I'm just trying to like
catch up cuz I feel a little bit behind
on life and then next week I get a
little bit more free time so I can
finally finally do some gaming videos on
Play City ever since I got my game
computer three or four weeks ago I have
not had one day of not having
responsibilities or work to be able to
sit down and play so I'm so excited to
finally be able to play something next
week I can't wait but I might just have
a little cheeky sip of that champagne
because I think why not and I'll show
you guys my outfit and then it's off to
cocktails don't know how much I vlog
because I'll be around people who don't
know me so we'll see we'll see if I come
back my shyness so much but I'll show
you guys my outfit so this guy's knocked
at my door and he's like would you like
some complimentary chocolates and I was
like ah wha wait this is whole thing

absolutely love this place suit and it's
time to go and get lots of small talk
and say hi guys my name is Danny and
hopefully make some friends let's go

having Cod Phillip hello hey guys I am
back in my room now guess who is a
running a sloth because I am going over
ready for one I'm gonna watch my hair
get all that nice and fresh and
everything then it was lovely it was so
nice to meet the brand properly and I
also sent it to Suzy who is hell of
October absolutely love her I've been
flying at that age but we never actually
probably met and she lives literally
down the road from me so it was
fantastic to meet her and catch up and
make a new friend it was really really
nice someone left a note for me and then
I was like what the hell there's a
really cool night and tomorrow we have
some brekkie and stuff for the origins
team but I'm gonna take off my makeup
have a bath
wash my hair and put on so much of that
new origins stuff and I'm very excited
to just go to bed with like fresh clean
skin and get all this makeup off because
even though it's so much fun to put
makeup on getting it off it's the best
thing in the world so I'll see you guys
in the morning good morning
I had the best sleep ever this bed was
just like incredible Oh No
I'm gonna run downstairs and get some
breakfast I am starving and it's back to
Brighton I have a full day of like
boring boring shopping errands today
like buying you place my bed and a new
crate for beans and you bedding and then
food shopping so much fun ahead I can't
wait
so I just got back home just got my
period yes I treated myself because I
mean any excuse you know basically yeah
I went to the white company when I was
in London got a whole bunch of like new
bedding absolutely like fitted sheets
and pillowcases do they cover and I
cannot wait to get into these fresh
sheets later
and I also got a seashells diffuser and
I'm gonna pop this in my office I think
I'll do that now and these are the
sheets and stuff that I got I actually
have four white copy diffuses in my
house right now my favorite one is the
winter one is just the best thing ever
and I have that in my room and I also
have then you spring one and stuff in my
lounge downstairs so I'm gonna pop this
into my office which could be a complete
mess so kind of is yeah it kinda is so I
don't know if you guys have actually
seen let's pop that here I think
actually I'm gonna get massively like
OCD about these sticks no gold let me
quickly just clean up this room moved
some stuff around in my house
so now got like a proper filming station
and stuff then I've just got some stuff
up here like camera equipment and
whatnot I've also got like my desk and
my little park and stuff so I just put
everything in like one space for my work
I know it's not like fantastic that I've
got like a desk in front of the
fireplace but you know for now you know
it works to kind of have all my stuff in
the same room and speaking of this room
and my old equipment thing back in it
again I today put up my date night get
ready with me video and I'm absolutely
like overwhelmed by your response to it
because it felt like old school YouTube
again like the kind of stuff that I used
to make for my channel all the time like
all my kind of proper sit down proper
good lighting good background makeup
tutorials and stuff and I loved making
it and you guys have just like had the
nicest comments and it's just I don't
know there's no such positivity and so
much love on that video that I'm just
percent like so determined and they
excited to make more kind of get ready
with me and make up for years again I
enjoy making it then I'm sure you guys
will enjoy watching it if you don't mean
I'm gonna put on some track suits and
I'm gonna be stitching here for the next
four hours also in doing my admin I'm
gonna do this and then I will check in
with you guys later
hey guys I've just gotten back from
doing some shopping done some damage and
I've got some incredible pillows I don't
even want to look at the price because
it's gonna be worth the bedding is the
one thing that you really should invest
in because you spend half your day in it
every single day's at my hobby nice and
cozy
so I also got beans I'm out of breath I
got things a great before nighttime and
also for traveling and everything it's
actually like massive hold on so this
crate is a lot bigger than she is like a
lot bigger it's a really big crate but I
figured that you know I want her to be
able to stand up comfortably move around
and all that kind of stuff and have like
a little water thing in it to pop on
here which makes you really happy that
during the night if she's thirsty so you
can just have a drink so I'm actually
gonna put this crate next to where I
sleep so just right next to my bed
because I still wanted to sleep in my
room I just find it a bit unhygenic
curved like sitting on the bed I don't
really like it and it ruins my sheet
then I just bought some nice sheets they
like their own space she's used to a
crate I had to crate train her for like
three months before she flew to
Australia said she could get used to a
crate as well so the only thing is that
I've got to be like consistent I can't
just like let her on the bed one day
like now that I'm not letting her on the
bed she can't on the bed like at all
otherwise she'll get confused and it's
it's not fair on her if I'm just like
one day you know telling her I'll click
over on the bed in the next she's on the
bed so it's gonna be half of me as well
because I do enjoy
we're on the bed but it's just I don't
know it's never really been something I
wanted to necessarily do she's just I
don't know too cute so I do it and then
I got some stuff from ticking max as
well so I've got some you like balls
photo frame stuff to roast my veggies in
this is my one I've got right now it's
too small so it's been a little bit of a
productive one which is nice and I am
feeling so ready to just make some
dinner and just collapse into my new
sheets and my new pillows that's what
I'm gonna do I am like defeated this
period is killing me so I will chat to
you guys tomorrow see you then good
morning guys it is Friday every let's
watch stuff on the stairs I'm like
stepping over I just got like an epic
delivery from two-faced and I've opened
the box but I haven't like looked into
anything yet because look you sent a
pinata I'm actually like really
interested to see if there's actually
anything in here or if it's just
decoration but is that not the cutest
thing ever but I've got all of these
goodies to open and a two-faced bat is
it time to get the anger out or is that
really kind of weird for me to just be
hitting a pony unicorn I mean not pony
I meant you know I'm not meant to like
anyway so here we have stuff yeah so
here is the collection it's all like
life's a festival kind of brand which i
think is perfect obviously before
Coachella which I'm bloody Michelle was
going to but I don't think this is one
of the palettes which it's absolutely
stunning I love the holographic and then
we have this which is a festival refresh
mystical effects setting and refreshing
spray so cute and we have this brush
which is amazing this is like a contour
brush and it is sweet then we have these
3d lipsticks not sure I will use the
green one personally but they are very
cool I think these are little
highlighters I'll just open it oh very
all they kind of like you know what I
mean
hey let's say alright let me swatch it
Venice a little bronzer
so cute I love it to face always I like
my favorite packaging ever and they're
not disappointed me this time this is so
cool so now I'm actually going to do a
video for my I say my main channel even
though this is going to be my main
channel as well I'm about to film next
week's video and that should be very
interesting one cuz I talk what stuff
but I've never spoken about before so
last night I didn't make it out to the
event in order to make out to London for
my meetings I got really really really
really sick yesterday I don't want to
get into too much detail but I spent a
lot of the day being sick which was not
very nice these events I go to the
majority of them I don't know of the
other people there because a lot of time
they're kind of more on the fashion or
blogging industry whereas I'm in like
the make up YouTube industry I suppose
so that's why I love going because I
love meeting people for my different
industries and stuff too but I just
figured if I'm gonna sit there the whole
time and just feel so sick and unwell
and upset is it is it worth me going cuz
I'm just gonna give a bad impression not
at least the brand it to everyone else
there as well so I figured it'd be best
to stay home so stay home
I actually really glad that I allowed
myself the day off and I put my health
first because now I feel like so much
better and I think that if I did
actually push myself and go out and do
meetings and stuff yesterday I would
feel ten times worse today so it's
better that way I've sent up doing my
meetings by Skype anyways that was all
fine but I am just gonna film clean the
house my boyfriend's coming over for the
weekend so I want to make sure my house
is nice and clean I'm like cooking theme
tonight and it's like so strange me to
cook for someone else
such a foreign concept so I'm a little
bit under pressure about what to cook
and make it tasty though anyway I hope
you guys have an amazing weekend I'll
chat to you very very soon until then
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
