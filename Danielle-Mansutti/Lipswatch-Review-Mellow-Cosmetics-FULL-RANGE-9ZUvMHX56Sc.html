today's video I'm doing a lip swatch and
a review I feel like I've not done a lip
swatch video in so long it's been like
over a year but then I got an amazing
blue brief for mellow cosmetics I got
their lip paints and their lipsticks
what I'm gonna do is do a quick mini
review and then I'm gonna jump into it
the swatches afterwards so the first
range that I'm going to show you are the
mellow lip paints the packaging of these
are to die for they are so beautiful the
lip paints are like a creamy velvety
matte which I love they glide on so well
and the color us a long long time and
they actually enriched with vitamin or
vitamin E and that is to keep the
moisture on your lips and of course it's
very important these are cruelty free
mellow cosmetics range is completely
cruelty free like they're vegan and I
believe they are paraben free as well
amazing so I've actually just filmed the
swatch part which you're about to see
and I absolutely loved the formula of
the lipsticks and the lip paints I found
the lipsticks which is what I'm wearing
now are so pigmented like that I'll be
eautiful and they have like a really
nice smell isn't weird that I actually
really like the smell the lipsticks I
don't know they smell really good so I
definitely think you guys should give
these a go they're actually designed and
tested in New Zealand as well which is
really cool and finally drumroll I have
a discount code to share with you guys
for my like cosmetics so you can get ten
percent off by using the card Danny 10
so let's jump into this watches I hope
you guys enjoy and
so I hope you guys enjoyed this lip
swatch video art it was Hickson fun to
film and I'll see you all very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
