today's video we are going to be talking
about social anxiety and shyness and
things that are very present in my life
and I asked you guys on Instagram
yesterday if you would like to see me
create a little bit of a miniseries we
do talk about mental health because I
think it is such a one thing to talk
about and there are many of you that
I've met in person who have actually
approached me and told me that I've
helped you in some way and that is like
just priceless that is the best thing
you could ever tell me what this little
mini series is going to be it's going to
be an open discussion and if this is
something you feel like you can't talk
to to anyone about them all have
discussions in the comments about it and
help each other out because we want to
create a little bit of a sense of
community for those of you that want to
reach out but the structure of this
video today is that I will be sharing
with you my personal experiences with
social anxiety and my personal
experience of being a shy person and
I'll also share with you things that
have helped me personally overcome that
I'm not giving you professional help or
guidance or anything this is just a
discussion and it's just a great thing
to openly talk about because I feel now
that I have a platform of over a million
of Q which is just craziness stories
like this where I can help at least one
of you means more to me than any kind of
makeup tutorial anything like that
because you are the most important thing
to me jumping on to my personal story I
feel like I have a hair which is
sticking out so firmly so I got to know
you my entire life I've been the shy
person all the way through school the
way when I was little baby and
everything like that I was all shy
always hiding behind my mum always gave
my mum to answer things for me and
always being that kid that gets a report
card every single year for the teacher
being like she's a well-behaved kid but
she needs to contribute more in class
and all that kind of stuff because I
literally did not speak so there's
absolutely nothing wrong with things I
can I just put that out there
nothing wrong at all is part of my
personality I'm proud to be shy I
actually get more attracted to shy
people if I see that someone's shy and
someone's loud whether it's friends or
guys whatever I always choose the shy
one because I'm like you're interesting
now social anxiety is very different I
will explain my perspective
social anxiety I just want to quickly
insert into this part
I've suffered a lot of mental health
issues throughout my life more so
recently than my entire life what I did
was I went and I saw my doctor and we
try to figure out ways to help me
because my my feelings of depression and
anxiety were forgetting very very very
very very very very hard for a few years
I thought you know I'm still get help so
my doctor ultimately the thing that
helped me the most were actually talking
to a therapist so if you are in a kind
of similar situation to me I would a
harder % recommend seeking out
professional help because it really
really really helped me so I will just
go on to personally my experience with
it and then personally what has helped
me
to me it is being absolutely terrified
of answering the phone or when you hear
the phone ring you start panicking it's
also being in a room full of people and
just to thinking that every single
person that room hates you and then when
you make the effort to socialize them
you start to think that you're annoying
them it's always always always
cancelling plans right at the last
minute because you just can't get the
motivation to actually leave the house
and socialize and be around people it is
feeling completely 100% alone in a room
full of people hiding in bathrooms to
get away from social situations and
panicking in the bathroom and just
freaking yourself out and I recently
came across something on tumblr which is
just so accurate I'll read it out to you
it says social anxiety will make you do
weird things like holding on to an apple
call for 45 minutes during the meeting
because you're too anxious to go to the
trash can that's ten feet away or it's
like waiting until someone else goes to
the trashcan first then you feel like
you're allowed to do it but then you
don't know like you're waiting to go
then you wait and see I'm gonna wait
five minutes and then I'll go another
like it's just craziness so there are
the emotions and the feelings you get
from it it's just feel like I can't
socialize I can't do this I can't do
that and it's the worst thing when it
gets interpreted as rudeness or is
actually just sitting there you're like
oh my god what do I do and the actions
and the behavior that goes along with it
for me would be like irritability
constant fidgeting shaking obsessive
behavior so I'd be sort of sitting
around normally like I could get my
fingernails my legs shake and my heart
goes really fast I get really sweaty
hands sweaty palms
my breathing I was really weird when you
are socializing sometimes you talk way
too fast you stumble on your words
stutter and you zone out a lot like
you're kind of looking at the wall and
like not really there in the room and
stuff like that that is also what kind
of feels like to have anxiety as a whole
but we're just talking about social
anxiety today I will do a full video on
like anxiety because that is like oh oh
anxiety guys so when I explained a lot
to my therapist she made it obviously
like well that's obviously social
anxiety and we came up with lots of
different things to figure out why I had
it and things that would help me
overcome it as well because I was
bullied away through high school it
actually unfortunately left me with a
lot of issues with my self-confidence
being a kid who was bullied you will
assume that everyone doesn't like you or
there's something wrong with you
and I just hate the fact that for the
rest of my life just a few really
horrible girls and guys episode of
ruined that part of me as a person
because I was extremely lucky to grow up
in a house where my mom and my dad gave
me so much love and support and it's
just like because I went to some like
snobby little private school these
horrible girls they kind of ruined my
head a little bit so the reason why I
want to talk about this especially is
that it was two days ago I was at an
event a lot of people there who were
bloggers or at social media I was one of
the first people that got there and we
sat in the green room at first as you
guys know I have challenged myself so
hard recently I travel the world
completely alone now I always go to
events alone it wasn't easy to get to
this point I still I still struggle with
a lot of um issues when it comes to
social anxiety I'm someone who likes to
grow and learn and educate myself and
the only way to sort of grow out of this
social anxiety shyness phase was to
literally push myself so far out of my
comfort zone but the more you push
yourself away from your comfort zone the
stronger you become as a person the y-z
become as a person I went on a kentucky
complete by myself a year ago and i
blogged the start of that and you can
see that i'm panicking in the hotel room
because i just was like what am i doing
this is insane i was so dependent on my
ex-boyfriend and my mom for like support
and you should like take them everywhere
me because i couldn't do things for
myself and i just decided one day like
i'm gonna challenge myself so hard so I
wanted to continue by myself best thing
I could have ever done for myself it
helped me so much grow as a person and I
have the option when I go overseas and
stuff to bring someone but
stantly I haven't because I want to be
able to be independent and not have to
always rely on other people it is the
scariest concept ever I know what it
feels like to be shy and socially
anxious to be by yourself in another
country it's just like what more you
push yourself the less you will be
socially anxious and you will learn and
grow so I really want you to think about
that as well but yeah I was at this
event so we're in this like green room
beforehand and all these girls and women
were coming in sort of like in groups
and sitting around the little grey room
like talking to each other and I yes I
was the first one that came in there i
sat down on like this big chair and I
was thinking to myself okay don't be on
your phone for one because that closes
you off and get your bad body language I
was trying to be really open so I was
just sitting there like sort of like
giving off good body language everyone
that came in the room would stick down
and sit with it back to me so I was kind
of like sitting there with everyone's
backs to me and they were like chatting
and just sort of sitting there like girl
like warders I have like all these
thoughts racing around in my head like
oh my god like is this something wrong
with me why is no one talking to me like
why am I sitting here by myself
like I'm I done something wrong I could
have it all started to anyone else it
just looks like I'm sitting there but to
me I'm like oh my gosh I just smile at
people and they're kind of like hmm just
like and everyone it's good to do that
because even though you're like I was
freaking out like so hard by doing that
and giving an open body language and not
being on my phone and not closing myself
off ultimately eventually someone turn
around to me and started speaking to me
and then I actually went up to other
people and I would speak to them body
language speaks more than anything we
look at each other and interpret each
other's body language without realizing
it so from the get-go if you're sitting
there and you're anxious and you're
closing yourself off and looking around
and whatever people aren't going to come
up to me like hey because they're like
oh she looks like she's being rude
that's biggest thing you're always the
same as rude or snobby so there we go
yes it is quite humiliating to be
sitting in a room by yourself and know
that people look at you thinking why she
by yourself it is what it is
it doesn't matter as a thing you always
have to say self will this matter in a
year no it will not like trust me it or
not and then we got up and we went to go
it's like another area whatever and then
this really really really lovely lady
who was a graphic designer
she walks right out to me she said hey
like I saw you by yourself before I
actually watch your videos and if you're
watching this show me feel so welcome
and asking me questions about myself
being so lovely one thing you also have
to remember that if someone is
approaching you you've got to think
there are awesome persons ask them
questions about themselves the hardest
thing when you are shy or anxious is
when someone asks you a question that's
when you start stumbling and getting
nervous or being like what do I say the
best thing to do is to do the other
thing and say to them so what do you do
or where do you live like what are your
plans for us today ask them questions
and you can be a listener because I know
we prefer being listeners being quiet
people it's basically just small talk
and I know small talk is like oh there
were some times but it's rather than
sitting there and just like freaking out
it is always better to be the one that
smiles then the one that doesn't smile
back so even though you're being
extremely friendly people there will
still be people that will sort of push
you aside or be rude to you or not give
you the time of day at least you go to
bed that night that you are a good
person and you are friendly you're not
the rude person that sort of shuts
people down so I always remember to sort
of have a few questions for people and
just realize as well that people can't
tell you're anxious like really they
can't tell so I recently asked you
through much wish I you had any
questions specifically about social
anxiety tips for keeping calm in public
I always end up hyperventilating one
thing that my therapist told me which
really helped me is the distraction game
all I do is that I will look around the
room I'll think of three objects in that
room that I can smell like what the
smell of it is I look at two objects and
look at what color they are
and look at another object and I try and
spell it in my head and that sounds
really weird but anything that you can
do to sort of change your focus is
really helpful best thing to do is to
leave the situation if you were in a
public situation you feel it coming on
go to the bathroom sit in the bathroom
lock the door and take as long as you
need to just sort of place mind games
and distraction games until you feel
like your breathing is normal again
anything and be selfish like staying
apart for an hour of you need who care
your mental health is way more important
than the party or the social event that
you're out like just remember that I
also need you to know for me personally
that everything that you feel is valid
never feel ashamed or guilty or anything
for feeling what you feel because you
can't help it it's not like you wake up
one morning be like oh I really love to
have social anxiety today don't feel
like you are a weird person for
experiencing what you do because no
you're just a normal person it has a
heightened sense of emotion the next one
I want to focus on is depression I also
want to focus on anxiety maybe stuff
like heartbreak things about feelings
like feelings of loneliness and stuff
like that those are in the comments
which ones are the ones I just said
you'd like me to focus on next and I
will make sure to do that because it's
such an important thing that we talk
about this and I'm really hurt that this
made you feel a lot less alone and made
you feel like you are not the only
person that experiences this and it does
get better like honestly if you watch my
first video you will see how much I've
changed like it's crazy
so I love you so much and I'll see you
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
