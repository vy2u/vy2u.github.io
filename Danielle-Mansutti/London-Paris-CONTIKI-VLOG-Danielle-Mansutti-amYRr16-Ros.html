Michaels looks a lot better doesn't
really I'm gonna miss you so much hmm
I'm gonna miss you I've already shape my
sights are taking me to the app I
managed to pass only 11 kilos I'm so
proud of myself and I'm gonna have a
very
love you bye
so just arrived in Doha and it's 35 cell
theaters they've just changed our
boarding passes for some reason and I'm
on a different flight than I was
supposed to be so let's hope I don't get
lost this is actually hilarious because
they decided to just randomly put us on
a flight which is boarding as we landed
and this Airport is shocked because I
like pacing pacing pacing
okay so hey guys this is my just got off
the airplane face looking great
I'm really scared like I'm really scared
about everything I'm freaking out a bit
yeah uh night anyway
um it's kind of weird like when you come
into you little hotel room and there's
already someone else's bag so yeah so
first time I've ever done like Gucci
 room but this is so far out of
my comfort zone I'm really scared though
so I'm like I bought this myself and
everything but I'm just like freaking
yeah because I feel like like I don't
know um but I haven't met anyone yes
I've just been like by myself the last
two days on the plate and stuff
anyway um the flight was pretty bad
I've sat next to some like five year old
kid he kept jumping on the seat and it
was really annoying um yeah I'm gonna
try and get a SIM card now to get
internet on my phone so I can talk with
Michael and stuff and then I'll update
you guys later hopefully I'm feeling
better later cuz I'm just so scared
right now sorry I don't want to be a
marshal I'm surely fine yeah he's my mu
it's not that bad a little view of
London I'm staying in the Kentucky hotel
which is called the Royal National and
I'm gonna go outside now and get
something to eat
this is gonna be like the craziest
hallway I just in my life look how far
down it goes it's actually great
seriously can't get over how green
everything is
so pretty
skateboarding's pretty as well hey guys
so I'm about to head downstairs and
finally meet everyone else who's if I
can take you tour had a little nap for
like 20 minutes or so but I think the
biggest thing right now is just the fact
that I haven't spoken to anyone in so
long like my mom is currently on a
flight to the state so I haven't spoken
her in ages and my boyfriend decided
tonight would be a great night to go
clubbing so that I can't even text to
him so I've just been like sitting
around I'll I can't really talk to
anyone about how I'm feeling so I've
been talking to you guys on Twitter and
snapchat and stuff and you can make me
feel a lot better so thank you guys I'm
hoping that the vlogs from the iran will
get better i know this has been quite
depressing intro but i just don't want
to be fake i don't want to be honest
about how I'm feeling and today I felt
so lonely this is probably the craziest
day of my entire life I have flown
across the world by myself and I'm
walking across London by myself and I'm
just freaking out because I just feel so
lonely and stuff so I'm hoping I will
make some friends that they're made up
for continuing at home good morning guys
it's now the start of the birthday I'm
my way to the bus it's 5:00 in the
morning I'm looking at what are you
doing so I've got my little suitcase and
stuff and just heading to
I think france is beautiful sorry little
story about be you'll see here's
something else the hills aren't you
liked it did it how because this that's
where the bombs are dropped during the
war so you can't go on the grass because
there's mines in there so that's pretty
cozy you know just getting on the bus
again
and next up he's happy so excited to be
Paris I went there with Michael two
years ago but we didn't even get to do
much so it's gonna be really really
really cool going there so I'll be in
Paris tonight
tomorrow the day after and then but
after that living for the French wine
Rijo
welcome to my crib we have two fabulous
hospital beds followed by a fabulous
shower followed by an airplane toilet
yeah but wait there's more
you also have your own fabulous little
sink dehydration dehydration when you
get up in the middle of a night and you
feel like something and then you have
the fabulous that's great
anyway
so I'm looking at these stairs right now
and realizing today with
they invented a short skirt
okay
please fit asleep for me because I came
here why for two years ago so just today
a really funny photo
my Instagram what's really weird is a
bit boiling up this whole bridge there's
like no locks anymore which sucks which
were like 20 euros so yeah we are now
going to wander around
so what Richard sucks today there's only
a tiny little bit over here which still
has a Luxan
hey guys I just thought I would check
back in with you I'm just currently back
at the beautiful hostel we are about to
go out for dinner and go to the Eiffel
Tower and climb it at nighttime which
would be incredible so I was having warm
on because it's really really really
cold outside so anyway I just looked
back at the footage from this whole trip
and I'm so sorry that I've been really
quiet down at the start oh there I am
right there yeah it was really hard the
first day was really tough but I'm
really proud of myself for sticking it
through and just making most of it being
really bubbly and friendly and all that
kind of stuff today was awesome
I really enjoyed today we just took
walked around Paris for eight hours in
my feet are very sore and you can see
from my face I am very tired as well so
yeah today was awesome so I think it's
like to say that a half of Paris for my
but today because I decided to wear a
short skirt on a windy day so if there's
a rookie error and something I've learnt
from so sorry about that if you're in
Paris all my butt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
