today I have such an exciting video
because I have such a peek oh my god
when I was away in Europe
I came back to quite a few deliveries so
some of this stuff I have bought with my
own money some of this stuff has been at
companies they've been so lovely to send
me some new goodies and then there's
some other stuff which I just randomly
found in my peer box and companies who
are lovely enough to just randomly send
me stuff but no reason I was like you
know what I love you the first thing
that I'm going to share with you today
are these acara eyelashes now you guys
know I'm in love with these car
eyelashes I am wearing my car eyelashes
today so these are from shop miss a I
buy this from shop this a and they are a
dollar I've bought one two three four
five six seven
I bought 13 pairs of lashes because I go
through them like so fast it's crazy so
I said to get 13 pairs these are my
favorite lashes of all time they are
just so so so so so natural and I love
them my personal favorites are number
415 they are them are sticking in the
eyelash category I have these lashes I
believe that they're pronounced as Guido
asked we de squadron I'm not too sure
but there are these lashes here they are
absolutely gorgeous these are the roller
lash collection and I think that they
are gorgeous it says they are
handcrafted with care every pair of
lashes is a testament to our passion for
design and fine craftsmanship we invite
you to experience the quintessential
fusion of the exquisite style and one
organs of the mink collection so the
lashes are absolutely stunning and I am
in love with these I'm loving how there
isn't a massive chunky black band around
cuz I hate that's too much just I've got
three pairs and I'm hoping to see a
tutorial soon I told them that I would
so I'm so I think it's a tutorial again
I went to Judy frame Athens just before
I left Greece and I picked up a few
things that I was quite disappointed in
the duty-free there wasn't really much
choice but the first thing I had to get
was the Estee Lauder Double Wear
foundation now this is in a different
shade that I've used usually wearing I
usually have twenty which I believe is
three that you want this is for n one
called shell beige and I thought that
this would be a great color for when I
am SuperDuper dippity-do perfect end and
I'm like Doritos I got perfect now with
double wear I'm sure you guys are aware
of this double wear is perfect in every
single way it lasts all day
and there's absolutely nothing wrong
with it except when you get photos taken
and you look like a ghost I wish that
double wear was photo-friendly it's the
most like on photogenic foundation ever
you look so white with this foundation
on so it's a damn shame so I would
recommend if you guys have or want to
get double wet that you get even like
non flash photography yeah I learned
that the hard way
next I picked up a lipstick I Mac a
lipstick in a velvet teddy my favorite
go to the lipstick cut my bumper today
like anywhere industry anymore so I
thought I would keep it up but when I
was there I actually got to cuz I'm like
obsessed and I can never find it yeah
the next thing I bought from Julie free
was MAC lipstick in diva
now I wore this in my Too Faced first
impressions video and so many of you
were so lovely about you really liked it
on me and that may be the source of so
who knows
so this is the Matt David lipstick it's
absolutely incredible I love it it's
such a nice deep red color and I'm
definitely going to wear this in a lot
more videos so if you ever see me
wearing a dark red color it will be
David by Mac because I'm in love with
this change and the last thing I picked
up from a g3 is the Pro Longwear Paint
Pot in what other than a soft ochre now
I have seen every single youtuber in the
entire universe except myself use this
so I decided to finally pick up my own
soft ochre Paint Pot it was just so much
cheaper in g3 in Athens and it is in
Australia so I was like you know what I
got to do it I'm gonna do it so I cannot
miletti wait to use this I'm so excited
to use it because my eye shadow might
look nice I don't know it because I
actually never use a base or a primer
which it's kind of stupid and then why I
shadows yeah I get annoyed because my
eyeshadows don't look like the right
color girls please
a bloody Paint Pot so hopefully it's
going to better screen that's hopefully
I'm so sorry I keep looking in the
viewfinder have you noticed that I'm
just like this setup is so strange for
me I'm just trying to see if it's
working so I need to look camel okay
camera keeps dying
so my next thing I have to show you is
this wonderful box yeah with this
wonderful name on it my good old mum
went to New York and when she was this
so first things first I have finally got
the anastacio Beverly Hills contour kit
oh yeah I am so excited to finally iron
this baby I've one of this so long and I
now have it don't wait to start using
this in tutorials and get comfortable
with it I already had to play with it
and it's so different from the I see a
little kid I'm like how did I survive I
have
no idea so that was one thing month of
definite so next I got a Mac lip pencil
in spice apparently this is the Carly
Jana color and if it is the color Jenna
color then that's gonna be awesome
because I'm finally gonna have lips I
mean there's another velvet teddy in
here that you were a saying that so yep

just appreciate Too Faced packaging
because not only is the packaging of the
product amazing but the packaging of
packaging of the product is also amazing
next I have got some lashes which are
called crown Morton

when I'm watching a YouTube video and a
youtuber pronounces something wrong and

people being like Danny you're so
frustrating do not ever put out seeing
anything right but uh yes it's Morty
anyway I was not expecting these

trying to lose a little bit overwhelmed
when I open up this box because for so
long are actually one of the shade
Athens by NYX and I kept looking around
for it in my local Target I couldn't
find it anywhere so to receive this
money NYX products it's a little bit
overwhelming it's a little bit crazy
because um I love these products I love
them and also I don't know NYX lip
products that well so if you could let
me know that the matte lipsticks the lip
creams and the butter glosses which ones
are your favorites and wax and then I
also came home to another little package
from my favorites so we have a cry from
Too Faced our fall 2015 collection is
worth falling for like it smart so when
I open the box this is what was inside
and then I had the blushes hiding away
at the back first of all we're gonna
have a look at the Too Faced love
palette I have seen desi Perkins use
