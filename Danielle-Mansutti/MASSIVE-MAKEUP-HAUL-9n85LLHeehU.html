in today's video I cook such a big haul
I'm just like where do I actually start
and I have just filmed all the swatch oh
yeah dedication a bunch of stuff from
Mecca and also a few drugstore products
and without further ado let's jump into
it so the first thing I'd like to show
you are these three two faced melted
metal chocolate or lipstick we have this
one which is a frozen hot chocolate and
then we have metallic candy bar and we
also have chocolate cherries now I was
incredibly lucky when I went to LA in
October 2000 these melted chocolate
lipstick so try that really early nice
feeling I'm gonna give these away to you
guys I'll be doing giveaways soon
because there's just so much makeup and
I can't use a little bit I will
definitely have a giveaway sometime soon
and they will be included but the
formulas are so beautiful and I love how
Browns have been really in recently
Browns just something so different and
so beautiful and honestly guys these
last and hey they're so good next I've
got a base of gorgeous little palette
from Stila
this is the sunset serenade convertible
color do lip and cheek palette and on
the inside it looks like this fun fact
about me I actually have never in my
entire life used a cheek lip palette
kind of thing before so I was feeling
with a lot of this makeup it would make
sense way to do something like a full
face of first impressions or something
especially because it nummies this style
of makeup before but I reckon I should
be pretty fun for me to do a full face
to first impressions with a bunch of
this makeup that I have in this hole
today because I've never used anything
like this before so I'm like okay guys I
am in love with the packaging of these
stealer foundations they are so so
beautiful and I absolutely love the
Grady
on the bottle so this is the Stila aqua
glow serum foundation I've got this one
which is medium tan also have fair also
I have fair light I'm assuming that my
shade will be medium tan so if you do
want to see a first impression I'm
eating my head I have my fennel it's so
hot today too light so if you would like
to see a first impression on they steal
a quick foundation and please let me
know because I would be more than happy
more than willing to do it next up of
these three concealers now these go with
the foundations as well
we've got light medium fair light and
then we also have medium tan ever
actually can never use Steelers face
makeup before you guys know I love their
eyeshadows but never have I use their
face makeup again if you want a full
bags of expressions or anything like
that then please let me know I would
love to try these out okay now these
colors are so gorgeous these are true
stealer liquid lipsticks so they're
called the estate all day liquid
lipsticks and this one is in the shade
backer it is a absolutely gorgeous sort
of plummy pink and then we have this one
which is oh here we go with the
pronouncation she auntie she it's the
HIA auntie I see auntie you guessing
it's Chianti I've never heard of that
word in my life but I think that's is a
pronunciation I'm like I don't even know
next I have two pallets from L'Oreal the
first one is this L'Oreal Paris Allah
palette nude this is a gorgeous range of
purples and cool tones and Pink's graves
basically eyeshadow colors that I need
to use more in tutorials because you
guys know what
my warm comfort sorry the palette is
actually really pigmented and really
beautiful and I love how there is a
range of mattes and shimmers as well so
they give you the option of growth and
then the other palette we have is called
beige which is a lot more of like the
cool toned Browns anymore sort of
neutral sometimes I don't even know what
I'm talking about I'm like you can see
the colors guys
you can see what I'm talking about next
I have these very interesting products
and then when I open these and try these
out I actually totally will i shudders
at first I was like I can't quite figure
out what this is basically the reason
why I was so confused is because the
head of the lipstick I shudder it looks
like that I was just like what are you
what are this I couldn't figure it out
and it actually doesn't say anywhere on
the product what it is I'm guessing from
the colors the lipsticks not eyeshadows
I know this sounds storied on me and
just ridiculous that I'm even
questioning what the product is but I
want to send this as a PR thing and I
don't really know what they are yeah
next I have this L'Oreal liner called
the super liner superstar I've always
worn by L'Oreal eyeliners that liquid
liner is always so good as well sorry
this will be used in a lot of tutorials
alright now I did cheat and I use these
we have a day because I just couldn't
resist these are the bare minerals best
skin concealers and my god they're so
good guys I used the really light one of
course I use this one called fair the
other day underneath my eyes
it did not crease it looks beautiful and
it just made my eyes look so awake it's
so vibrant hybrid what I mean so awake
and I thought I'm the worst at
describing makeup I'm just like guys
it's really good you should buy it
all seriousness we have got fair we've
also got light and then we have medium
and we have medium of golden as well and
same with the Steelers situation I've
never used bareMinerals
face makeup so I'm very interested and
excited to try it out
next I have these two out of glass
products that I've been super excited to
try out the first one is the ambient
strobe lighting powder in brilliant
strobe light and the second one is the
ambient strobe lighting powder in the
iridescent strobe light so they look
like this on the inside and I honestly
have heard the best things that are
glass products they are not products
which I have used too much in the past I
have used some of that powders but I'm
very excited to give these ago next
thing that I have is this which is also
something I may pronounce completely
wrong it could be Ilia it could be alia
I'm not too sure but it's good even me
ili a bit you know who knows this is
this year vivid tinted moisturizer and
this is in 93 something that I
definitely want to do more is wear
tinted moisturizer instead of wearing
like a full-face foundation I mean it's
just sort of like lighten up the makeup
a little bit and this is something I'm
also really really excited to try I'm
not good i am i next I have these
Maybelline products these are the color
blur cream matte pencil and it smudges
now this might be very similar to
L'Oreal's product Mehta showed you guys
before but who knows
so I have a large variety of these that
Maybelline sent out to me once you open
the little stick looks like this and
then you push up this end here and they
are and they're very very very very very
very smudge Abul which I love this is
actually something that I've seen a lot
on YouTube but I've never actually gone
out and got myself for anything these
are the color tattoo your eyeshadows by
Maybelline so the first one I have is
this song which is called dramatic black
and then we have this one which is
called vintage plum that we have
chocolate suede and finally we have
creamy a beige question for you guys
would you be interested anytime soon of
seeing a full-face drugstore makeup
tutorial because I really like to use
these and just try them out in a video
so I'm gonna be great if I did a full
face drugstore makeup store sometimes -
I'm just so using two products and just
used a whole variety and things and show
you guys so if you would like to see a
drugstore thing the things that you know
I've asked you like ten videos that
you'd like to see I'm sure you'll be
like Danny we want to see a little bloom
just make it don't have to us the next
thing I have are bunch of nice products
and you guys already know that I am an
oz addict so I was very excited to get
these the first one I have is a velvet
matte skin tint this is in the shade
Cusco which is medium or 1.5 this is
sort of like a tinted moisturizer this
is it's a matte skin tint now I'm 100%
sure of what that actually means I'm
guessing from what I can see in my hand
it's kind of like a foundation but it
may see my face I'll have to wait and
see what way
next I have these two lip glosses from
NARS this one is vida loca and the other
one is instant crash
I actually think these two colors are so
beautiful and so easy to weather both
nude colors so I would definitely wear
the leader
local one with the salt lip liner by Mac
and I
we're the instant crash run with the
spice lip liner by Mac I now have two
nozzle lipsticks the first one is called
Rose clip and it is this gorgeous shade
right here and this second lipstick is
called band red which is an awesome name
I love how this is kind of a burnt
brownish red they're both super sexy
colors and I really like them they're
going to be so great for awesome for us
in Australia that we're going into it I
can start wearing Browns and reds again
now I'm including these I know they're
not so much a makeup product or anything
but I really love the packaging so these
are some nail products they're called
Smith and cult
I reckon their packaging is so so so
sweet this one is called check the rhyme
which is a gorgeous purple color we have
the Graduate which is an amazing name
when it's this gorgeous color here so
this is by a brand called kit I love
love this palette packaging it's so cute
so I woke up like this
it's the kit one minute or one two
palette so it's going from drab to fab
and an instant with this magical makeup
palette a collection of your need now be
basics to take the fast track to
flawless and we have a flush we have a
lip color we have like a glowy bronzer
we have an eye shadow and we also have a
highlight basically everything a girl
could ever want in one palette next I
have these two li planets which are from
the Gwen Stefani Urban Decay collection
this one is called Firebird and it's
really nice a really nice funny purple
and this one I have one in love with
I've been using it everyday on my lips
just like an everyday plum of them this
one is called ex-girlfriend and then
there's also this lipstick which is
called
spiderweb and can we just talk about the
packaging because I really really love
this lipstick packaging final lipstick
is this
oh my god it's so nice it is called
Rocksteady and how awesome is this color
oh my goodness look it is things I do
and so that concludes my big makeup hope
this wait so now everybody figure out
where I'm gonna put this mine cup
it's a ridiculous amount of makeup but I
hope you guys enjoyed this haul and it
was informative although I am the worst
when it comes to makeup description and
stuff I'm just literally like it's a
concealer and it's awesome so you should
get it I'm just like oh my god yeah I do
