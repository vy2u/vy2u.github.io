 my god oh my god oh my god look
we're just arrived and literally I just
picked this up for my door and my
mattress the guys just pulled up right
now oh my god yes yes yes there are so
what many came home
oh my god actually feeling like an
electrician right now look at all this
ridiculous cable work what I had to do
but it looks like I have cable and my
interests working whoo hey guys so I
haven't actually chatted today which is
crazy
Wow I've seen a bit of a productive one
I need to delivery so I have to build my
I canif it Akina IKEA furniture now
which under so excited about really
should have to pay for someone to come
over and do a Publix and come not he was
but I've been on a traditional day I
actually set up my internet and my cable
and everything like that so that is
working and as I'm filming this I'll be
able to upload my first moving box night
I'm so excited about that so I'll take
updates so it is currently 227 p.m. and
beans
oh absolutely something about being um
she should have landed ten minutes ago
so now I'm being like really paranoid
I'm like why haven't I heard anything
yet and I'm going a bit crazy so every
minute is feeling like an eternity right
now just waiting to hear from jetpacks
to say that she's arrived and she's fine
and what time she's coming tonight and
everything like that sorry
this morning was a little bit strange so
I woke up here on the floor and if Kyle
I wasn't here anymore and stuff was the
first time that I've been truly alone as
all of us have been here and because my
internet was just so awful it would take
me about 10 minutes just like send a
message or send a tweet it kept failing
as well
was so frustrating so I couldn't even
like talk to my mom or anything like
that I felt very alone hmm I guess sad
was that I felt very like I'm sure and
like everything like super homesick and
I was unpacking my suitcase oh I've seen
my clothes into my wardrobe and I just
kinda crying a little bit because I
don't know I just didn't feel that good
I felt very homesick and a bit lonely
and a bit like what am i doing what am I
done
kind of thing the other guy's gone on
the sun shining today it's a beautiful
day we in turn arrived my skin
Makena I keep saying that IKEA staff the
surprise I can build that and actually
have places to sit and I just feel like
I have lots and lots of lot of things in
my mind that if I figure out and yeah
this is not going on in my life but I
kind of stopped for a little bit and let
myself have a bit of a pride I felt like
super overwhelmed and then I thought you
know what what I'm doing is actually
something I should be really proud of
and I never let myself be proud of
myself that makes any sense but I
thought I literally have packed up my
entire life and independently moved from
one country to another like and I'm
doing this all completely on my own so
of course it's a little bit hard and of
course I'm going to start missing people
and I don't know it's like a really
weird transitioning thing so I felt a
little bit like today gel is not bad at
all joke simply fine I've been awake
since forever swing that because I'd
like literally hahaha when I believe I
have a mattress delivery from Simba that
I can open very soon and I'm so excited
about that like that's my little update
that's why I have really been on camera
much staffing a little bit like a bit
emotional but I'm feeling a lot better
now now that I'm like connected internet
I've got my CV and stuff I feel so much
better I just feel like I can just talk
to people again like a lot completely
isolation alone
sexually and like online sense
so yes I think it's time to check out
this mattress okay so here is the bad
boy and I'm actually kind of very
confused so I'm trying to figure out how
there's a matches in the book I'm like
how does it fit in there it's crazy but
yeah Simba they were absolutely
incredible and they're helping a girl
out and sleeping on the floor so
appreciated enough and I'm so happy I'll
have someone actually sleep tonight woo
I have a mattress can't wait to see like
how feel like it is a really comfy
mattress I'm sure it is everyone writes
about it on YouTube I'll say that it's
amazing so hopefully you guys can see me
I have no idea okay
maybe I should just kind of pull this
out I did I did oh yeah I'm so happy
that this in the messages oh my god okay
I just can't wait to actually test it
out and you see how comfy knees begin I
need comfy right now well I'm going to
magically turn this box into a bed says
one mattress five legs comfort so let's
just it oh well I'm sure it's gonna be
better from the floor that I said nice
flexing
whoa and there it is
oh it's gonna be heavy sigh
the whole mattress right normally like
holding mattress is like the worst thing
in the world but look at how well it's
packed
that's actually crazy okay I have just
unpacked my mattress and oh my god how
did that fit inside oh I actually
haven't
rose hazlit yet I thought I wait to go
on camera for that let's do it oh my god
oh my god that is horrible I seriously
cannot thank Simran uh I think it is I
just feel like so much happy now that I
have a mattress and what's really good
is that I have next day delivery which
is why my life has been saved today
literally or yesterday it comes today in
sane it's also the most advanced matches
in the world and it's a copy edge so
they won't go to sleep I'm being
completely honest with you guys like I'm
not being paid for this or anything I
genuinely I'm so comfortable right now
like it's amazing and just realizing now
how bad a lagoon floor only did it ever
on my hair I know guys I was starting to
be a little bit panicky there because
when you arrived an hour ago to London
Heathrow and I wasn't contacted at all
and it is a risk to you know make bugs
travel because of their breathing issues
whatever but luckily branches and have
breathing issues she's got a really good
nose as a bit okay so she doesn't snore
want too much or anything I got but
there's always a chance of it not going
well and I think very anxious about that
so I didn't hear any news from
themselves a little bit worried and I
called them I found I hate their animal
reception number thing just like when my
static anxious eyes whenever like I was
in I was in panic mode I just called her
my children that I had a dull bit ahead
ride
I've heard of anything yet and stuff and
yet over the flight number and my last
name was kind of stuffing so okay just
just hold on a second I'll get back to
you and then I was involved like a
mother and how much is sitting here like
she's making sure you'd make it my best
friend didn't make it like what am I
going to do
and then after be a long time with my
life away to you I'm came back inside
just like was this pug and I was like
whoa yes she is a ploy why and she's
like why she's fine I was like oh and
for you so they just said that right now
she is going through customs being
uploaded and that she's gonna have some
water and food and I can't wait to see
her but I can't be like a good five
hours here and it's like 3 p.m. now but
um yeah it'll be well but anyway try to
go to my teen furniture and I just
uploaded my table my day okay
