blog I'm sorry
silence I was just in London for some
meetings I just got back hence like the
half split off makeup but I'm making a
bit of a progress with my packing and
check out my fantastic outfit whoo I am
currently gathering a bunch of stuff got
my dishwasher onto my plates all tidy
and I'm gonna start packing my glassware
analyst stuff in a second but packing
again I'm gonna do little packs of time
and use my suitcases and stuff obviously
for clothes and Phil that's the bream I
only got three boxes the net wasn't
enough for all the stuff I've
accumulated living here but Tyler is
gonna come tomorrow and we are gonna
transport pea fragile things in her car
first like my 1 million Park my Mac my
ring life a lot stuff and oh my makeup
just all my makeup oh my god crazy and
I'll be checking in with you guys a
little bit light up up yes
breathing you can oh my god ok I've got
to figure out my wardrobe now look at
this by the way so much colour I can't
handle it
also in case you didn't know this
rolling your clothes into your suitcase
is honestly the biggest lifesaver ever
for like just saving room for traveling
as well I mean I could do like a little
packing hacks video or something one day
by rolling it just saves so much space
so with the roll method I've actually
got about 2 or 3 layers here the clothes
just stacked up on each other I've done
a half my wardrobe in half a suitcase
that is good so we're dealing with the
makeup now this is like you know layers
and layers and layers and layers and
layers of makeup this is all going to my
cousin she's gonna be very happy with
this so I'm just saying again 80% of all
my makeup because it's waste if I have
all this to myself so I'm just like
sorting out some stuff now and a little
bit of this oh yeah oh she's found a
trace beneath on that now I'm thinking
doing a little giveaway as well
actually got so much stuff that I want
to do a giveaway for I'll give weird I
mean like so much stuff so I've got like
the nikkietutorials over the web and
here like its benefit staff morphe
brushes all kinds of stuff and I've also
got some Christmas collection things I'm
just arranging the makeup now to give to
her because yeah she'll be very happy
about this hello making progress my
wardrobe is now empty obviously to take
out some coat hangers both wardrobes are
done except a bit of Australia money
because I don't know what it I've done
oh I just tripped over that I've done
all my drawers so my makeup drawers are
clean and all of these oh thank god here
we go
I have packed away a bunch of stuff now
I just decided I got really fancy edges
through like clothes and bin bags as I
uh
a couple of putting it in boxes anymore
I can't fit these shoes in anywhere
which is a bit of a pain in the bum and
about this couch the l-shaped couch that
I had I'm actually gonna donate this to
the British Heart Foundation they're
gonna come pick it up and I'm just
giving it to them as a donation because
I don't really like this couch and it's
like four months old so why not give it
to good charity
am i right I've decided tomorrow when I
wake up I'll deal with the TV and stuff
all of my cabinets or like empty now as
well which is good this is Charlie's
that she left so she can grab that when
she comes back
and obviously tomorrow gotta like empty
out the fridge of my fridge is just like
so sad I've got this salmon in a bit of
like veg your that's it noise it stinks
it was my fishing in my spare room as
well this is room that gives me the
heebie-jeebies I get so much better
energy in this room but anyway I'm
taking this mattress in that big van
tomorrow's but oh yeah this is like size
and beans was here as well thanks it's
gotta like pack my sheets and stuff but
this room is pretty much done my
bathroom is pretty much done I just
emptied like most of my storage cupboard
and everything up for bath obviously
it's got my toothbrush there I'm Aphex
night but this is all empty so we are
nearly there it's basically when I woke
up tomorrow after I've done my face
makeup then I can clean this section and
I'm probably gonna have to unscrew every
single lightbulb as well no idea where
I'm gonna put that actually but oh god
we have to figure that out as well need
it like a soft bag or something for that
really that I'm getting there but making
progress this is good good morning
everyone
it is moving day it's about 6 or 7 a.m.
I can't remember but I've made a lot of
progress I've got up super early packed

gonna set up all my internet and stuff
at the other place so all this here is
kind of like the stuff in tech and tile
is cut it's all the valuables all the
stuff I just don't want to go in the van
just in case it breaks and then we've
got a dog hello Doug good morning Hey

I knew beanie what's going on so this is
done now to be honest like it's pretty
much all packed I've got like my
playstation and Internet in there in my
room I have just removed all of the
light bulbs from my vanity all of my
drawers are empty as a sock fabulous all
I'm gonna do now is just take off the
bedding of it later on when the removal

I'm packing is more exciting applause
there's no wardrobes at the new place or
anything

out some rubbish and clear the frig out

hour I'm gonna head off and pick up the
keys

bedroom which will be this theorem then
right in my bathroom right now I've got
two sinks back you and my bath then so

since I've been here so I'm finishing
off putting stuff around so I will show
you guys properly once I'm a bit less

be in my other place to get
professionally and have to be there to
supervise I don't even know they just
