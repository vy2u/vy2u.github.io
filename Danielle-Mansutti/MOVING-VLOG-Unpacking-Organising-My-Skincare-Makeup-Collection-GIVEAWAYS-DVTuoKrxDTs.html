want to see that let me know but I am
going to make myself some dinner and
continue all this tour because I am
exhausted so I'll see you guys then
alright let's give you guys a little bit
of a tour of what has happened so far so
today I'm actually getting my wardrobe
delivered
hence this but I decided just for the
moment I've put all my fragrances up on
my fireplace I've got all of my
favourites up here and I still have my
mirror yeah and I don't really know
what's new in terms of the layout I'm
thinking like wardrobes and drawers are
gonna be here once they're built
I've actually hired a handyman today to
come and help me do that with my filming
room it's not completely clean I
apologize I was working last night and
had time to clean up but I have set up
my filming space and my whole like
vanity space and everything and I've got
my little Lake plaques there which is
cool and then in the spare room I'm
gonna have some drawer set up at some
point probably around here but I've just
got like a kind of little wardrobe
situation set up for now just feel like
my coats and jackets and stuff and some
heels and bags and I've got my keyboard
there and the bed the bed frame is being
built today which I'm so excited about
finally gonna have a spare bed like a
proper spare bed and then in my lounge
again sorry didn't probably clean up a
breakfast and everything but I love
these flowers so Beth who picked up my
couch she does my nails
she got me his flowers which is so
lovely and they smell incredible and
I've got to gem blowing candles there
and it feels very cozy
yesterday I built this TV unit so that
it hides like all the wires I hacked
like I don't know the drill so I had to
get scissors and make holes in the back
of that it took a long time you tell you
oh my god took forever so I'm still
arranging this room it is a little bit
messy when I do a proper house too
obviously it'd be nice and clean and
everything
and then in here
yeah million flat packs ready to be
built today and then in my kitchen I
have to get rid of like all this
cardboard progress is being made that's
the show I've got all my little things
up here but that is how the house is
looking and I'm loving it because it's
so cozy and I'm obsessed I'm so happy
I'm off to the Maldives tomorrow so
expect some cool videos coming up in the
future if you want to see any more
moving vlogs if you want to see like how
strong Homer Hall let me know what it's
like completely finished I'm more than
happy to do that some of the moving
process I did off camera just because I
had to get so much stuff done so it's
nearly there
once the flat-pack furniture is built
then will be pretty much there's it's so
exciting and thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you very soon bye
