apologize in advance it sounds like
bombs are going off outside but they're
literally building a house right behind
my back fence and it's so loud today we
are doing a Q&amp;amp;A we're doing another
Twitter Q&amp;amp;A I asked you to use the
hashtag don't events we're just gonna
jump straight into the questions and not
have a boring long intro and a lot
canister the first question is what are
your biggest fears okay so this is gonna
sound so bizarre obviously everyone that
fears death well the majority people
fear death so death something I fear is
trucks really weird so if I'm driving
and it's been this way since like as
long as I can remember ever since I can
remember being a passenger in a car or
anything I'm on a freeway motorway
whatever you call it and there's a truck
on my left or my right hand side I
always feel like it's going to emerge
into my lane and like squeeze my car
like into like a wall or something
Louise yeah yeah yeah I'm scared of
trucks weird beer isn't it have you ever
been arrested and what is the best thing
about YouTube I'm no Reid arrested yes
I'm a sweet little girl not really
and I'm never planning on being arrested
that sorry but never happens the best
thing about YouTube to me is you guys
I've said this before and I would not be
anywhere if it wasn't for you guys my
second favorite thing about YouTube is
filming I love filming editing not so
much but I love definitely about knowing
how did you and money make and what's
your favorite part of living together
love you I love you too we met in 2010 I
believe we're a like orientation day cuz
we're going to the same high school for
like a year 11 and 12 for sure you guys
have felt like this before I just
literally saw her across the room in my
head I was like I need to be friends
with this girl like she looks so cool
and she's looking at me and we're just
kind of like giving each other the eyes
and we're like
like you it was the most random thing
ever I was so shy back then as well I
just literally walked up to her and I
was like really pretty she's like oh
thank you oh you're really nice follow
line and like we just started talking
about what I said to her I said that she
like Fe from Skinz I just kept thinking
she like Fe and I used to be like
obsessed with Fe Fe and seriously was
one of my only French s I've ever made
in Australia I've actually clicked up
some 100% but that I have applied force
conversation or anything she's so easy
to talk to and we just sort of bounced
off each other and now we live together
the next question is have you smoked
before the answer to that is yes I have
smoked before going through like a phase
when I was like 14 15 I think my tombow
phase where I was really into like this
kind of grungy dark sort of scene and my
friend Jordan I would take photos and
then in the photos you tell me oh it
looks so cool like if you had smoke and
other stuff I didn't actually smoke I
smoked for photos and that is honestly
like one of my biggest regrets ever
because it was so stupid and obviously
those images are still everywhere no
idea who I was I was sort of got this
like rebellious phase you've got to keep
in mind I was getting bullied at school
and I just did not know who I was and I
sort of turned to like trying to look
really cool and take cool photos and
stuff but oh my god the one way I can
describe it is like what my mom said she
thought it felt like the first time she
did it it feels like a rope is being
like drags down your throat it's like I
am so against smoking but I'm kind of
glad in a way that I did try it and they
did do it for a little bit because it
made me realize now how much I do not
want to go near it like at all yes I did
do it I'm not hiding that I did anything
like that I was just being a rebellious
little teenager but uh I hate it so much
what is your favorite job you ever had
and not so favorite job obviously this
is my favorite job that I've ever had if
you guys want to know it the jobs I'm
head of my life
I've never actually talked to you before
my first job ever was at Centro it was a
chocolatier place and I did it at my
local shopping center I basically made
sure to people make copies and hot
chocolates and melted chocolate and I
ate so much chocolate and got a little
bit Chilean oh it was amazing I loved it
after that I was helping doing
receptionist work and then I worked in a
coal center and I worked in complaint
section of customer service for pizzas
yeah I don't respond at like every
single shift because people had too much
cheese on their pizza or their order was
two minutes late so they called me like
the c-word like I was like okay
someone's a bit angry
tell us about your tumblr days this fits
in very well with life said before about
the smirking question it's hard because
I regret my tumblr nicer than at the
same time I don't because I wouldn't
think Who I am now without the whole
like tumblr thing I am so different now
like I'm a completely different person I
was just going through so much crap it
was like my escape from everything I
almost like pretended to be a different
person online I don't know it's like a
weird coping mechanism I wouldn't be
myself on tumblr so that I could like
not think about my life and that sounds
so d doesn't it I know that so you were
trying to drag up my past and try to
just be like oh look she's be like this
and she's like that but it's like yeah
that was like the most 15 I'm 21 now you
cannot compare a 15 year old to 21 year
old as the same person like that's the
biggest development phase like in your
life pretty much it's like those years
so yeah my tumblr days were my skype is
in a sort of like a big defense shield I
guess when I was trying to like pretend
to be some like dark cool girl and I
don't know and I wasn't really and then
at night time I just like playing the
sins in my pijama ism and have to like
put on it too dark makeup and be like
all of taking an indie photo again
tumblr and all that stuff I should do a
whole video on that like reactants on
photos
nice outfit definitely make me who I am
today but definitely I'm not the person
I was back then I've grown up a lot and
I've grown up a lot even from like last
year oh my god I was watching my vlogs
from like a year ago I changed really
fast it's really today's last question
is what do you miss most about living in
England
apart from HP sauce of course we get HP
sauce here I thank God so I miss so much
about living in England especially like
around Christmas time it made me realize
how much I just miss England because
here everyone cares a lot more about
some of the nature that Christmas so
Christmas isn't really a big thing where
is it England it's everywhere like all
the houses are lit up and it's cold and
you're eating like mince pies and
watching Christmas TV and like with the
fire and the hot chocolates and I'm like
sweating my butt off like trying to cool
down like an ice cream the two things I
miss the most about England are the
people and the food I do not miss the
weather at all that's for sure
I miss the food so much I miss just like
little things if I asked to have vinegar
on my chips here I looked at like I am a
crazy person and I said you know they
give you been a girl like on every table
when you sit down at the pub I miss like
Yorkshire puddings I missed like all
four chocolate crisps and cereals I
missed like a little bit I don't know
it's like all the food the best and I
miss the people I obviously missed my
family and my family friends and to be
honest one thing I really do miss about
England my mum says as well is that a
lot of people don't understand my
feeling here I feel like in Australia
Dejima not saying it's bad at all this
it's just my opinion the humour in
Australia is a lot more like an
insulting humor like people sort of like
call each other names and it's a bit of
like banter and whatever or is it
England it's more like an ironic sort of
dark sarcastic humor so if I'm being
sarcastic people normally turn around to
be like really no like right now these
workers that are making the biggest
noise in the world I don't even know I'd
be like oh isn't it so pleasant to me
it's actually quiet room and it would be
like
it's not quite though for you talking
about megabytes up when I'm with my
family my chemo like goes back obviously
it's like English humor and it's just
think she was very fast it's woody it's
like sarcastic and here it's just they
just don't get it
I like what for this month's Q &amp;amp; A I
