today's video I finally have my full
makeup collection what made the cut what
didn't get given away or thrown out
before I left Australia is all my holy
moly holy boys we great products and I
really hope you guys enjoy it I'm so
excited to show you this we're not going
to do let's jump into it so welcome to
my makeup throws everyone I feel like
I'm doing like a plane safety
demonstration right now so I don't
actually have all these drawers filled
or anything like that so what you're
about to see is absolutely everything
that I have now makeup wise there is not
much at all compared to my old makeup
collection so what your Etsy is all my
mother growl stuff like all the stuff
that I can't recommend enough to you
I have literally given away donated etc
95% of my makeup so this is everything
that sets and all my whole girls and
what survived the cut and let's get into
it so here we have the first drawer
which consists mainly of skin makeup
concealers foundations powder and we've
been running around a little bit in the
background I also keep my Beauty
blenders in here as well so my favorite
concealers of all time or of course the
heart-shaped ape concealers and so when
it came to the selection process I of
course kept there's many things I could
in my skin tone so depending on whether
I'm wearing like they can or not
whatever that's why put really light
ones cuz I'm actually very very very
light skinned without my channe then I
have yes we one is here concealers here
I've got three I've got a Rimmel one and
I think this is maybelline and then a
bare minerals maybe yes so just a few
and then powders I have got my trusty
Oprah banana powder I use this every
single time I put on makeup I love it I
also have this powder from ex1 cosmetics
is well LC of Rimmel stay matte powder
hiding behind there then I have the Mac
Studio Fix we should not really use
anymore but I thought it's so expensive
that I can keep it anyway and it is good
it
that I just don't really use it now then
for my little foundations and this is
now like all my concealers or my
foundations or my powers and that makes
me so happy because it's actually what I
do truly hues so in here I have my two
everyday foundation so this is dependent
on my skin color at the time so I have
five and three in the Urban Decay all
nighter waterproof long wet liquid
foundation this one is running out and
you get another one so when I'm not
wearing my pick 10 I like to use the
shade three but when I intend I use the
shade five and I absolutely do
foundation is my current holy holy grail
and I love it and I also have these nice
velvet matte skin tints I really like
these four days that I want to keep it
quite natural and again I have them in
two different shades depending on how
much time that I'm wearing and against
the natural days I have the it cosmetics
CC cream which I've used in few videos
and I've got two of the Too Faced Born
This Way Foundation in warm beige and
golden love these two bits and then
finally just here hiding at the back is
the Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
in the shade 310 and then I have a few
primers hiding back here like the
Smashbox photo-finish but I've decided
to just leave at the front the ones that
I actually use and as you can see this
is a literary about to run out at the
Kat Von D lock-it primer I use it to
remove and ridiculous and then I have my
Urban Decay all nighter spray which
packaging I no need to clean so that is
my skin drill for my base and I can't
tell you how nice it is to just have
only this now of stuff that I truly
because it was just yes it was a waste
after I'm going to use so this drawer
here actually consists of all my
highlighters blushes and bronzers is
everything now
this obviously is like my Holy Grail
cell so my absolute hologram when it
comes to highlights are the Ophir
highlighters I think they are just
absolutely unbeatable so I keep as many
of them as I possibly can in here I've
also always loved the Mac gold deposit
as well like a shimmery bronzer
highlight it is beautiful
this is the bronzer that I'm currently
using from bareMinerals it is very dark
but I do like it's like a shimmer it's
beautiful and then I have these two Too
Faced highlights the thing is to be
honest I don't think there's that great
but they just look so pretty that I've
kept with me right true if I'm going to
be 100% honest I then have two blushes
here I have this is the gala for Nia by
benefit which i think is absolute
don't know when I have an unused benefit
dandelion one as well because it is so
sweet I also keep the hot mama by the
balm lush too because I do think this is
really really really really good for me
the last blush that I have is the NARS
orgasm
of course now for my bronzer section I
have two - first ones at the back this
one is Sun bunny I think so I'm bunny
which is gorgeous then I also have the
trusty chocolate Soleil bronzer as well
as well as the sweetheart
bronzer and then as you can see I have
so many cooler bronzers this one I had
to keep because it actually is my name
on it which i think is so sweet and so
cute then I have the NARS Laguna if I
can get that out which is an all-time
favorite bronzer of mine and then of
course the Bahama Mama by the balm which
I love and have used in so many videos
and I'm aware my hands look so ugly
today I'm really sorry about that
but it's really hot too saying my veins
are popping out little cigarette and
here are all the lipsticks that I own
which I find absolutely considering I've
managed to just make it only these bad
boys and I still need to get organizers
I still need to you know properly put
them into sections but you can basically
see I'm a bit of a fan of an artist lip
paint slightly obsessed I also have some
of the Too Faced melted maps from
colour-pop here and then lipstick wise I
have some tart stuff smack nods as the
Lord of decay vice then I have a bunch
of lip liners the majority of these are
chichi color pop and a few Mac
underneath I have even more the Tartus
lip paint so you guys know that I
literally wear these all the time I
normally wear like the shades here to
normally Rose a bestie get it salty I
love them and I decided to keep hello
fiends as many of the colors in this
formula as possible because I love it so
much it works as well for me so I
thought I would keep all of them and
then when it comes to lipsticks my MAC
lipsticks are just like velvet teddy I'm
pretty sure yep this is Goa Teddy so
most of my lipsticks are just new do you
want to focus so yeah most of my
lipsticks and news I love the smell this
is really weird I think might look smelt
really good and then the same with the
Urban Decay one this is the stark naked
color which is gorgeous and when I kept
this red by Estee Lauder because I think
it's just like the most classic
beautiful red shade of all time it is
absolutely doing so I just deny I wanted
to kick things off formulas I really
like to me personally there's a lot of
liquid lipsticks that I've tried that
just didn't work for me at all because
it was dry and flaky and horrible and
these are the ones that works me the
best I love Too Faced most maps and the
Tarte
color pop is a bit hit-and-miss some
were really good someone really drives
me just depends on the formula I was
really good as well
you want a Nastasia which is the black
one and perhaps we watch it it really
isn't much you remember back in the day
where all my drawers were like filled
debris still yet to sell this one oh my
god and one below it actually well now
we are moving to the other side of
drawer videos to learn how to speak as
the drawers go in here
I obviously keep my soft lashes so this
is just where all my journey in beauty
store lashes leave I just have them all
along here on the sides as like my older
pairs and my new pairs and everything
like that and then in here I also again
I need to get more dividers and stuff
and I need to actually section this out
in a much more presentable way but for
now in this box are all my eyeliners
here all my mascara and then here all my
eyebrow products so for the eyeliner
draw I have some black eyeliners such as
the top Anastacio Kylie this is Clinique
I believe then I also keep you know a
bunch of stuff like glittery eye liners
which are urban decay I could be wrong
I'm not too sure then I have all the Too
Faced colorful sketch marker liners nice
and colorful hearts up and then I have
my all-time favorite lash glue there as
well and so the - car is where much
using the moment what I love these - of
course always be read music subscribe
but also I'm loving the top light camera
lashes one I think this might be the
waterproof version I could be completely
wrong I think this is the normal version
movie but for some reason the waters
perform works a lot better for me and I
really really really really love it then
I have my eyebrow products here's a
bunch of Benny brown stuff then I have a
tart
max a nostalgia and over for like actual
tip wrappings then for the been
aggressor I have just like the kabrel I
have the Gimme brow and the ready flip
Braille which I use every single day so
my next drawer is a lot of fun this is
my single shadows glitters pigments
drawer absolutely obsessed of the straw
because I'm obsessed with glitters and
pigments at the moment at the back here
this is all gypsy shrine glitter which
is honestly absolute gold it is at the
bottom let's make sure that it's
actually focused like how some names the
like festival makeup stuff I love this
still a lot much then I have some
glitter glue and stuff at the back as
well as some lease payment then I have a
bunch of color pop shadows some single
shadows and like this is delicious as it
is Mac one I love a single shadow so
pretty
get these slow fast slow double shadow
okay Auto greatest personal favorite
pigment right now is probably my Englert
this is the AMC pure pigment shadow one
two four and it is absolutely ridiculous
like how beautiful I seriously I'm
obsessed with the stuff like
oh that was a lot my hand is super
glittery now but whoa messed with this
anyway anyway then I have some Oprah
single shadows and I have got all of my
hands perfect this is a bunch of the
artists cool stuff it's the diamond glow
powder which i think is stunning as well
I do you see sometimes eyeshadows you
can use it as a highlight as well to
just show you it's kind of like a really
pretty so I have all the so god I made a
weird noise in it so I have all the
clothes lined up here pigments love the
short a bit absolutely obsessed that I
love anything pigmented glittery sparkly
shimmery and now for my beloved palette
drawer so these are all the pallets that
made the cut and I might quickly
actually show you all this because I'm
obsessed with eyeshadow it's my favorite
kind of makeup product so let's just
start from easy this is a nostalgia
world travel palette kind of contour
look at it so pretty and I have the
tablet Pro palette as well come on focus
do your thing and here I have two of
these
Smashbox palettes which I love because I
do this would you do it cuz it was like
I love that I play with all of it so we
have this one which is a scissor
oh god is that helpful one two like that
and then this one which is super warm
which is absolute all for me like that
and here I have some of the bomb matte
eyeshadow palette this one is we meet
Matt criminy which i think is stunning
that red oh my god life then we have the
meet matte nude which is also stunning I
did buy this for my own money
unfortunately came cracked though
sometimes and hiding next to that we
have some steal stuff
this one is me eyes are the window
palette in mind and then this one is so
this one is soul it's beautiful and the
former's of these shadows just
absolutable their souls inside then I
have my true face stuff here I have the
Too Faced natural eyes palette this is
an absolute classic I am obsessed with
the shade honey pot I see him like every
single day eggs I'm like I have to keep
this then I also have the chocolate bar
and the sweet peach palettes this
chocolate bar palette is so special to
me because when I worked in the call
center I saved up for absolute month to
like this or it was like 60 something
dollars and at the time as long as you
can really or that for an eyeshadow
palette I didn't have any high-end
eyeshadow palette anything and I thought
this is my first little gift for myself
as high-end makeup product so it is
super old doesn't even have names in it
or anything like that and I've since
been sent other Too Faced chocolate
hearts this one so special to me a lot
of meaning behind it so my first day of
a high-end palette so cute and I have
the sweet peach palette which of course
smells absolutely delicious I love it
and then hiding here we have the hottest
Pro palette which is an absolute
favorite of mine I love this so much and
it reminds me of Bora Bora and all the
good guys then I have like a little Mac
one hardened bear over here I have a
color pop little thing which I kept
because I love red I have not used this
yet and I have a special one which is
actually not an eyeshadow palette so
that away this is the Kat Von D shade
light palette which of course again it's
an absolute favorite a bit dirty is now
well I have some multi palettes hiding
down there I paid for more palette I
love them I think they're awesome
but it was super big I'm sure you guys
have seen multi-part 5 million times and
now I don't have a multi coat
and I have the collie Jenna the first
one that she did that bronze palette
which I personally loved I not had
standing mixed reviews like I love this
I think it's really good
then I have the many mu a makeup geek
collab which is also a favorite because
it will the warm tones a lot and then
we're nearly there
this is the BH Cosmetics take me to
Brazil palette which I actually use the
other day when I had a really red orange
e eyeshadow look and I put on Instagram
you guys to relax it if you want to face
tutorial with me using like a really far
reread palette what everybody read
colors let me know how I use is probably
just funny absolutely that's done and
finally have this Mac palette which I've
never really used in my life before
maybe just like all shade but it sent to
me and it's so bloomin expensive but I
was like I'm thinking it you better
leave via both my eyeshadow palette and
then the final draw is actually quite
sad because I have burgundy palette and
then some expensive outs at the back but
this is the V palette that I use for
everything she goes which so long to
store I didn't quite make the journey so
success please thank you yeah so I've
got a restock so it's the reason why
happened throw needs out yet because I
want to make sure I get the right I
should have to replace it what that is
my last and covet so thank you guys so

card here you haven't seen my previous
