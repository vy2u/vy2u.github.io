welcome finally to my apartment - uh I
can finally show you like everything
because last time that you watch this
I'm pretty much like I'm not living here
anymore this is Riley this is my little
apartment and I love it so much and this
is my shadow and you probably see her in
every single frame just following us
around so this is my kitchen
so my kitchen is like a really small
size but I absolutely love it and side
note I didn't like clean my apartment to
the extent of it looking like I don't
live here I want this to kind of appear
the way it would if you just walked
through my apartment on any random day
so I kind of have a few things lying
around and stuff it normally I put away
but I thought now this is how I leave
like I want to show you guys exactly
what it's like in my apartment sooo
let's go back to the kitchen yeah okay
in the kitchen
first of all we have my fridge which I
absolutely hate because it doesn't work
until they're warm all the time and it
sucks it's from eBay and it's not
clothes anyway here are my keep magnets
I think they're pretty cool yeah my
little stove in my oven and I have a few
cabinets and stuff like that my kettle
which allowed to glass with a blue light
thing that's from Kmart my little
microwave here then I've got some sweet
potato and bananas I love I've been
honest like spotty and black is it like
sweet and awesome and with chopping
board and then I have this photo frame
and yeah that stresses me out as well I
know I'm too lazy that's like the kind
of thing that I look at all the time and
what I should fix that
well I always forget to do it yeah this
is my kitchen
oh hi little thing oh I'm rethinking up
one day to hold an actual MTV Cribs
things and see inside my fridge
so what do we have inside my fridge we
have some wine we have some mayor HD
sauce we have a whole bunch of kombucha
almond milk or some like chicken thing
pasta tomatoes lettuce
get eggs and cassava so that is a breach
of a 22 year old girl who is low pretty
much and then from the kitchen at the
next room that we have is this little
dark room which I like don't really like
going in this service mean a lot of
things actually
I recently like clean it out a lot for
the movie first of all it was my bedroom
so this is where I used to live and
sleep hello shadow and then it was my
filming room so you can see I've got my
lights in here still this is my big one
that I used to use which is a tiger
aquino flow for Bank thing then I have
this little light which I've actually
never used before
as you can see it's a little plastic on
it but for some reason one of the little
tripod things or something here just
stuff that I'm packing for when I go to
England as well as I'm speaking to Nicky
boy these products on my Twitter I feel
like few shoes and stuff and then yeah
these like my drawers so this is worth
stuff like my activewear leaves and my
pajamas and my hoodies and yeah not very
good at folding Am I
so yeah this one's going to few things
this actually leads like into a bathroom
but it is actually been to the bathroom
when it's just kind of gross like public
pads on the floor and yeah it's just the
most appealing thing in the world and
originally I slept in that room and I
filmed in this front room because of the
light in the front room but then you
know things changed like that so
basically now I actually film here at
the front so this is my little lounge
living space this is my couch which I
got from ebay for $70 plus heaps of
marks all over it but it's awesome
because fans can have fun with it and I
don't worry about it too much anything
it's not expensive and then here I keep
some things on this at the table which
is really where I like keep my food this
is like where I spend half of my day
sitting here my laptop working watching
TV then the candle and I'm currently
burning at the moment is this dry am
love another glass somebody like
peppermint marshmallow and it is so damn
good and moving on over here this is
where I keep my 1 million subscriber
this is up to me
I have on the wall but renting and being
a tenant you're not allowed to just like
throw things on the wall hey beanie
what do you did so this is my TV and a
lot of people ask me where the plants
from that was my Christmas present for
my mom and dad and it was from freedom
furniture I believe and yeah I
absolutely love the plant I wish I could
take a team in with me Oh gorgeous
so I spend a lot of my time here you
guys have seen me vlog like right here
as well but I spend a lot of my time
looking at this my mirror is from Ikea
and then over here I have a few more
candles as well like to take I've got
some Christmas ones hiding at the back
my Nintendo switch lives here and my
shadow lives there then that's pretty
much the front that of my apartment this
room you'd imagine a shower and a toilet
all that's in there it's just like kind
of boring so I want to show you this is
what I call Ben's house it's like five
times the size of her but she loves it's
where all the toys live and everything
like that and it's also for crate
trainings when she's going to England
with me as you can see the door or
anything like that so I just keep like a
toys in it and she's kind of learned how
to go in there and not be scared and
kind of see as a happy place so that's
why I've got a big ugly like orange
crate right there this is the other side
of what you guys see essentially so
first of all this is my backdrop that I
use in my makeup tutorials which kind of
sits here and lives here for now I love
it because it's kind of a bit rainbow
holographic and it's from spotlight and
then I have a stand that I cross on
which was from eBay I believe you don't
either
so my desk is from ikea it's one I feel
like everyone in the world has so on my
desk right now again so anything I
didn't clean up too much this is
literally what it would look like on a
normal day so over here this is the
camera that I use for my main videos
I've got like half-eaten Minnie Mouse's
thanks Ben
it is a Canon 5d Mark full sleeves that
I use for filming then I have my little
mirror here which I got my children with
chart trip and a speaker and
my Mac which I edit on and what kind of
stuff do my sims on so when I do my sims
Let's Plays I sit here and I do that I
have my little Marcus on hiding at the
back as well which is a mobile
microphone then I have a bunch of
perfumes here which I believe and I've
been told like five million times it
should be like slept on my hands my
friends because I have my perfume in
sunlight they're like what are you doing
down here like apparently having you in
sunlight makes the smell go off or
something but it's proven to be okay for
me I don't know I just like having it
right next to my desk it is kind of
pretty
so yeah I have a bunch of my favorite
perfumes here and this is just a little
plant from squat light as well another
artificial one else we have my desk okay
lens caps awesome oh yeah this is my
stillness jewelry you guys may seem to
collapse but I did stillness as I kind
of sit here I'm currently working my
mom's birthday present it's really cute
guys look if you look at a sneak peek
hmm Seba get the cheese coming home in a
few days so I'm like working on that
like little scrapbooks for her this is
where I keep most of my like go-to
makeup so I have all of my favorite like
lip colors and stuff in this drawer and
favorite eyeshadow and just little bits
and pieces then I have my and makeup
brushes as well as you guys know these
are like my actual drawers for my makeup
and stuff and I've cleared out so much
of my makeup but I don't really have
anywhere near as much CC oh my god
that's somber what we should've cleaned
and then this is my favorite part of my
apartment my views the screens of toilet
by the way
so got two little chairs here and I wish
it was like a prettier day to show you
but this is the view from my balcony and
as you can see I am very very very high
up so I get a pretty nice view so if
you're familiar with Melbourne you can
see that right there is the Albert Park
like 12-time beans and I would kind of
walk all the way up there outlet passes
and around the lake and then we come
back so Melbourne City is behind me this
is like facing the bay and stuff so my
parents house where you look all the way
down there somewhere this is Port
Melbourne and then you've got like st.
kilda and let me try and zoom in as much
as I can show you you can see you've got
the Yacht Club down there and then
that's like so sort of beats and stuff
it's so beautiful but if you like
literally is what sold me on this place
because it's just stunning a lot of
people when they come over there they
just can't like handle standing on my
balcony because it's just so high up but
yeah I've never really been able to show
you guys my view my little
because obviously privacy reasons but
because I'm moving it really smelled
another anymore so yeah hopefully they
will get a bit slower so it's like that
should show it like on a nice blue day
how many sounds like then we have oh
this room this is my bedroom is my bed a
lot of blask
where my bed covers from there from a
target and my bed itself is from snooze
I think so yeah beans love looking at
the windows well she does it all the
time she's watches the traffic and stuff
when she barks it because she's so sweet
so this is a view that I wake up to I
love it I'm going to miss it so much
when I move it's just like that's what I
see when I wake up awesome
so my room is so basic because I like my
sleeping space to kind of be like my
quiet place and I always found it like
if I had my work in my bedroom like in
my parents odd house even up like my
desk there and filled my room it made me
really shoot it out and I was like I
thought I have a bedroom which is just a
bed and that's all I got that's just a
bit and I've got my to like little bit
side tables that's lamp is from Ikea my
laptop there and I got like the things I
need for sleep things I've got my mouth
guards I grind my teeth and then a got
like more content and stuff then I have
my little Ultra probably close though
it's kind of gross so starting again
got my little ensuite in this room here
so this is my like Russian station this
is my shower and then in here is some
ice going to fly out at me about you OOP
we're good
okay so this is my medicine cabinet oh
you guys can have a peek in here is my
favorite like skincare items at the
moment so I just got like a whole bunch
of stuff that I use like every day but
heaps glamorous and lush got a blonde
top skincare Nas
Mario is it the desk I struggle hard oh
my god you guys I tried this and wonder
lash like anti-iran it's so good it is
so so good then I got some clinic and
Jersey were on bunch of stuff and then
up here is like some stuff that I have
for my hair actually that's not how
about skincare I just like basically all
each cell I don't I didn't even notice
that inside and then the top I detest
them I can shaving cream all that fun
stuff so that is a little peek inside my
medicine cabinet this person wasn't it
ago so this is probably my favorite part
of my apartment because it looks you're
still looking other windows cutie this
is where I literally spend a lot of my
time sitting here and waking up and
looking over at that view it's just
stunning I will never be able to get
over how beautiful this view is so I
think that my apartment has been like
the perfect size for me I have like a
car park in my apartment also 2-bedroom
2-bathroom apartment with the most
stunning view oh and I got a slew of it
I've loved living here so much I have
loved my apartment but I haven't loved
apartment livings that makes any sense
hey because I feel like the whole like
communal living thing where there's just
a lot of noise all the time and it's
just like being up so high getting down
to ground floor just takes like five
million years and getting up my car bar
takes so long and everything a little
bit like annoying especially when you
come home with like you're shopping or
whatever you just want to walk to the
door and like put it down because my
apartment itself like if I could pick up
this apartment and move it's like a
ground floor somewhere would be
incredible so that is pretty much my
apartment I hope you guys enjoyed it I
hope you guys enjoyed seeing the view as
well because yeah
I wanted to show you that for a long
time but my parents always like no think
of your privacy but now I can finally
show you and I'm so excited to show you
like my new flat when I moved to England
as well so thank you guys so much for
watching today's video I'll see you very
soon and until then have a great day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
