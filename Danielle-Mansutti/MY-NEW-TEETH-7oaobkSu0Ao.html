you might be thinking your teeth look
really similar I can't see any
difference and that's the best part
because I went to dr. Angelou alas who
you might know from the YouTube world as
well he is an absolute god of Dentistry
it's amazing I had so much confidence
that I'd received exactly what I was
after
anyway once you see my before-and-afters
you'll be like oh my god
there's a lot of difference the best
part about it is that I told him I want
my teeth to still like my teeth
afterwards and that's exactly what he's
done it's almost like he's kept all the
same curvature of my old teeth and added
it to my UT reason why I decided to go
ahead with this whole teeth
transformation journey was because I was
actually really self-conscious about my
teeth and I don't know many of you know
that or realize but there are a few
things going on my mouth which I wasn't
very happy about although my teeth were
nice and straight from braces that was
fine the actual shaping of my teeth and
my gums were making it really hard for
me to do like big full smiles on the
camera and so I soaked my parents about
it for a little bit as well and then I
called when I loved your teeth and don't
get anything done and then I was just
thinking about it I thought well I want
to do this for myself and I have so much
trust in dr. Lazarus cuz I had actually
been to me a year ago to get a little
bit of a gum lift as well so it already
met him already knew he was and
everything so I thought you know what
I'm gonna go ahead with it why not
literally why not
so if you guys have talked to my vlog
channel and you keep up with me I love
you and you would have known that I went
to see dr. Lazarus first a day before I
met some Sydney so while some thought
boys will go and see him so I went off
to go and see him and we had a little
session wasn't level was a few hours
where we lighted my gums because my gum
line on this tooth and was like really
really low and when I do full smiles
like it made me really really quite
self-conscious to see photographs of me
smiling and having such a gummy smile
you whiten my teeth as well that
actually it's a little bit sense
do I do always want to warn you guys
like I was a little bit sensitive about
it but it was so worth it
my teeth was so white afterwards and so
white that I met so what more could a
girl want I was like oh and love my
teeth so just over a week later I came
back to Sydney and then I went back to
see dr. Lazarus and this procedure was
like the really like for long like yes
let's get straight into your teeth kind
of procedure so it was a long time in
the chair but oh my god looking in the
mirror afterwards I was just like who
are those my teeth oh my god oh my god
oh my god it's once we just look at the
really highly magnified photos of my
teeth and so to recognize all the
contributing factors as to why I was
showing quite a gummy smile so the
underlying bone was quite bulky and that
showed excessive gum display and this
was also complicated by the fact that my
teeth actually lent inwards and that is
actually something that dr. Angelou
thought that it came from my orthodontic
treatment as a teenager so although it
made my teeth look straight it is kind
of pulled them inwards a little bit too
much
I did have premolar teeth extracted and
in order to close the space there my
orthodontist way back when do you
actually pull my teeth closer together
but it did as you can see kind of
collapsed my mouth inputs a little bit
and my teeth actually quite avoid or
round it that means there's a lot of
negative space within my teeth when you
do look at the teeth in isolation like
this you can really see all the patches
of negative space and that negative
space is all the little triangles you
can see her which makes the smile appear
Gaffey so we really had to address all
three of these factors to improve my
overall smile so first of all we
actually raised the gum lines that they
were more proportional and in turn means
that there's more tooth and less gum
when I was smiling he also recontoured
the gum tissue so that it was less bulky
and then we're going to broaden the
appearance of my smile but making the
teeth more vertically inclined we also
wanted to make some subtle changes to
the anatomy of my teeth to make them a
little bit fuller and less rounded so by
making some subtle changes in key areas
we actually improved my whole smile
quite dramatically and most important
thing to me was without losing my
character and this is actually a really
important step because it actually let
dr. Lazarus try out my smile before
actually doing it and going ahead just
see if there's any changes that we
needed to make so he did actually use a
wax on my teeth so we could see an
example of how it was going to look at
the end so there were no nasty surprises
or anything like that and we decided to
go with composite veneers they're also
porcelain veneers but dr. Lazaro
suggested at my teeth watching quite
good condition and that wasn't a row
that we needed to take so we actually
tried out different shades on my teeth
first to see what color he needed to go
is too much my teeth perfectly and all
that kind of stuff and the first step
was to apply a mild acid to my teeth and
then he just was building layers of the
composit veneers and the final step is
the contouring and the polishing and
this is just to make them appear natural
lustrous and just you know as me as
possible it's really not until you see
the before-and-afters until you realize
like how much magic dr. lasers performed
on my teeth like it's insane the
difference it's just made me feel so
much more confident with my smile so
much more confident with just like my
face my mouth you take a such an
important thing I feel and being happy
with your teeth makes you smile more and
be more happy as person yeah I mean how
funny is it when we all try and avoid
dentist's appointments but I would
literally very happily hop on a plane
and had to fly to another state to go to
my dentist's appointment because I love
him and his work so much so thank you so
much doc classes for my new little
chompers I'm so happy with them and I
hope you guys enjoyed learning about my
new teeth transformation why I did it
and the performing offers and all that
cool stuff so I really hope you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you next time
