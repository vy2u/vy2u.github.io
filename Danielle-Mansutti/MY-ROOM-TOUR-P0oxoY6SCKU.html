today's video I am giving you a room
tour it has been a long time since my
last room tour and I completely
renovated my room I also asked you on
snapchat if you like to see this and
there were thousands of you that
screenshot it and it is so funny to
compare this room tour to my old one
you'll see how much has changed it's
crazy so hope you guys enjoy and lift
him so here is just a quick little
overview of my room you guys would
recognize the little background corner
with the fairy lights from my background
and then as we move over you guys don't
see this part this is my wardrobe and my
bed with a little spoiled rotten dog
sitting on it as well she is quite a
little princess the first thing you see
when you walk in is my 1 million gold
play button from YouTube I just love
this park and it makes me so happy so I
keep it near the front door and then
underneath that is some drawers which
keep my undies and really exciting stuff
like that in them and then as we move
over we have the drawers my fairy lights
we have my TV my desk which is where I
sit and film and work so back to the
little fairy light section I love you so
much I'm such a little child I'm like
very light yeah I have some makeup here
I do have a full makeup collection on
this kind of stuff if you want to see it
clearer and then on the top I keep some
candles and fake flowers just stuff that
looks pretty for my background so these
cubes I got from Kmart I believe and I
keep stuff in there like my favorite
books I have my Too Faced travel bag
some two face products Bumble and Bumble
products because their packaging is so
pretty I love it so much and it smells
so good I also have some dry shampoo up
here I also keep a bunch of things like
perfumes my fake tan Sunny's in these
wicker baskets I just have like hair
appliances and all that kind of boring
stuff then I have this bunch of skincare
here my favorite kind of skincare
micelle award is of course because you
guys are slightly obsessed with my
seller water like just just slightly can
you tell
and I have some nail polishes here it's
so oversaturated they all look orange
but you know what I mean and we have
some perfumes these are bunch of my
favorite ones and I also love the bottle
so much so I thought they'd be great to
stick in my little background cube
things as well and then my favorite
perfumes right now are black opium and
bonbon I love them so much so moving on
from my little TV section we move over
to my desk and here we have my makeup
brushes my Mac this is the microphone
I'm currently recording this on it's
called a snowball microphone I believe
you can see some eyelashes underneath my
Mac I should have cleaned that up down
and there we have my camera and then my
bed and then as always um
someone is sleeping on it she is just so
cute I love it so much I'm sorry I show
her so much on snapchat and stuff I
really shouldn't I'm like obsessive
crazy dog lady I swear and then we have
my wardrobes here living up to my quote
that if it ain't black put it back on
the rack I have a lot of black clothing
and I also have a lot of black bags so a
little bit obsessed with the color black
just a little bit I know it's not a
color it's a shade but you know what I
mean I can do a full wardrobe tour for
you guys but it is mostly black just let
me know if you'd like to see that and
then the top my favorite candle ever is
the vanilla caramel taha glass house one
it's so good and I just got these new
little boxes that I keep lipstick soon I
can do an updated collection if you guys
would like to see that just let me know
I hope you guys enjoyed this in room
tour and compare it to the last one
because it is so funny to do that and
I'll see you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
