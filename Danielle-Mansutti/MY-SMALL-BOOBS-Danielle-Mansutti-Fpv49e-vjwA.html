don't have any professional lights we
have no like skin softening filter on
I'm not wearing my big mask of makeup my
big mask yeah that makes sense my big
mask of makeup
we are literally chilling grab yourself
a drink you click on the title it says
boobs and we're gonna talk about boobs
and I'm so excited to talk about boobs
get yourself a drink we're gonna like
chill we're gonna chat I'm gonna talk
about body confidence though it is doing
I am a member of the itty-bitty titty
committee where I'm not actually wearing
a bra right now and I don't really worry
about a lot in a lot of my videos so my
boobies are quite little quite small and
it's taken me a long time to accept that
it's taking me ages to look at them in a
different way and so often have I
contemplated getting a boob job because
I'm always like my boobs out of
proportion with my kids because I'm a
pear shape when you see big boobs enough
on Instagram every time you're
unexplored it is natural to sit there
and think oh mine doesn't look like that
and to be honest we have big boobs small
boobs boobs that flop down boobs that
flop up anything it doesn't matter let's
get the first and the most important
part clear your boobs are made to feed
your child so when you have your baby or
if you have had your baby and your baby
is sucking on you move that is all that
they're there for that is the literal
point of Bhoots when you think about it
and you realize like how sexualized
boobs have become it's kind of weird
because when you think of what they
actually are
they're just fun bags full of milk your
children doesn't matter if their babies
are small with around if they're
triangle it's a teardrop it doesn't
matter you know what matters is that
they're healthy and they do their job I
want to talk about the fact that social
media can really really skew your
perception on your body I go through it
still I know that I'm not completely out
of that zone but I completely understand
that when you see it enough you might
want to do it and if you do choose to
have a boob job
it's your decision and no one else's so
don't listen to anyone else but yourself
if you feel it's right for you if you're
doing it for yourself a lot for the
others go for it like I'm not saying
never have a boob job I'm just saying
I've gotten to the point now where I've
accepted being an itty bitty titty
committee and I want to share why is
small boobs are awesome like small boobs
are fun and they're perky and they sit
there and we don't get a backache and
they're just chill just chill boot my
mum has like the exact same boobs as I
do my mom's are their fifties and they
just haven't moved like having small
boobs means that when you're older
they're gonna be like the same so we're
very lucky in that sense there are pros
and cons to each side I can't wear
certain dresses because they literally
squish me and I look ridiculous isn't it
you have like nothing yeah any dress my
camera bra I'm like because I don't have
like natural cleavage so I just have
this like skin I was like not really
wear lots of cleavage stuff however if
I'm gonna wear cleavage stuff there are
amazing push-up bras out there like
push-up bras are sensational what I love
about having small boobs as well it's
not only the fact that I've never really
have to work bra but I love wearing bra
let's I think they are so cute and it's
just not really appreciated enough I
just want this whole like new wave of
people appreciating small boobs to
happen because that's it and I know that
not everyone watching this will have
small boobs but I do so I'm speaking
from my own experience obviously
sometimes where I let you sit and think
that maybe I was created by whatever you
know out there created me to be a
certain way and maybe I should just
embrace what I have rather than just
looking at it and hating it I will
always stand by the fact that confident
girls are the most beautiful girls in
the world it doesn't matter what you
look like it all depends on your energy
so if you are someone who has fantastic
perfect perky big boobs and you are
really really really like shy like I am
I kind of go into a corner and talk
about how insecure you are like I am no
I do that all the time you're not going
to come across as attractive as a girl
who walks in you might not be
conventionally like the most attractive
person but if she walks in and she has
and
using positive energy she's fun to be
around she's confident she rocks what
she wears she's gonna look so much more
attractive than the stereotypical
attractive girl if that makes sense I
stand by that a hundred percent and I
know how hard it is because I struggle
to I went to Dubai like a month ago and
I just later the whole time thinking
like what people think here my body oh
my god and I have so many body issues
but this is me finally a point run like
you know what screw it like I'm gonna
embrace my eighty bitty little melons
and I'm just gonna like rock it I'm
gonna wear things that look nice with
small boobs I'm gonna just like chill
with I swear to God if that gets me to
gift I'm gonna die I want to be starting
a new movement I want us to all and
breaks up I just want us to embrace it
were born with however if you're really
really really really really really
really really really really really
really dislike what you're born with and
you want to change it it's your decision
I'm like a big cup I can sways into a
stain if I try and make myself feel good
about myself but then it's always like a
bit too big and I have these cups that
are just like too big that I'm like but
I'm wearing a thing it's like feel
better but I'm so uncomfortable you know
what I mean let's spread some itty-bitty
love in the comments I'll catch you guys
down there and until next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
