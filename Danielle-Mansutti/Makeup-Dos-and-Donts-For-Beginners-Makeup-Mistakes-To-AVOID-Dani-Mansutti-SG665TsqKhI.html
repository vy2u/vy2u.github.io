kind of looks like what you take home
first what you will of this hi guys
welcome back to my Channel today we are
doing a makeup do's and don'ts video
which I'm so excited about because I've
actually never done a video like this
before I have watched so many because
they're so helpful especially if you're
a beginner like the advice in these do
and don'ts are life changing and of
course if you do do any of the things I
suggest you don't do this totally your
personal choice if you want to do them
or not feel comfortable doing it that
way then do it in that way but this is
just my guide as my own do's and don'ts
and things I've learned to do and not to
do stuff like that so for this side of
my face we'll be doing it in the do's
and this side will be the don'ts and
just quickly pause this fear if you're
not really subscribe to my channel
always do is hit that subscribe button
down below I set up two new videos every
single week I would love to have you in
our family so without further ado let's
dive into the first thing to mention is
the importance of primer
I will someone is to never ever use
primers can really see the point of it
or the purpose of it but it's seriously
hydrates your skin and it is so
important to put underneath your skin so
that your skin not only is ready for the
complete makeup application but also it
does make your makeup it does make your
makeup yeah it does make your makeup
last a lot longer about the whole day
and I find that like I don't use the
primer I tend to get more lines and you
can see like little wrinkles my loans
just like it I would totally suggest
getting a primer and if you don't know
what your skin type is go to any makeup
counter and I'm sure they will let you
know for me personally I am normal to
dry so for me I like to use primers that
are hydrating and also to avoid that
horrible laugh lines so I'm just going
to get a little bit of primer I honestly
just use about this much not much at all
I really I think it's that necessary -
absolutely drown your favorite not
necessary at all and I'm just going to
lightly rub it in to my skin and I'm
going to make sure that I'm covering my
last lines because I
my problem area seriously ok so now I'm
not going to climb this side of my face
it's a lot drier this snail feels like
really smooth really hydrated so I'm
sure it make a big difference and come
to the foundation application ok so
let's talk foundation we've all had it
where that sometimes we might want to
look more hand so naturally you think
she'll wear like a dark-colored
foundation say and it's never really the
best truth to be honest with you it is
always smart to just always match your
foundation to your neck and for someone
like me that say cones it's different
for that I match my foundation to my
neck and not to my face because I face
obviously like a lot lighter so matching
my foundation to my neck I'm going to
use the Urban Decay all nighter
foundation in the shade 4.5 and I used
to use the show 5 and it was too dark
meaning to use it all the time and I
would totally suggest if you are new to
foundation everything to apply it with a
Beauty Blender because it literally
saves your life so this is a Beauty
Blender
it's always better to wet it before use
because it's not very good when it's dry
and I personally just put one pump
directly onto my face like this and I
just like bounce the Beauty Blender onto
my skin and I just use that for my
entire lower half of my face I just find
it a little bit one way with foundation
if you go a little bit too overboard you
risk the dreaded makeup line so I'm just
going to blend this into my skin and rub
it in and then when it comes to my neck
I like to just blend it down there as
well now we are looking at absolutely
delightful photographers a foundation
and a half without so I'm going to grab
a foundation which is a little bit too
dark for me this is the Too Faced Born
This Way Foundation in golden and I'm
going to put this onto my finger
directly and then I'm going to with my
finger just rub it into my face now when
I was younger I definitely did this
before school and everything I literally
was like
all about this in your application but
not only is it quite messy for your skin
you know it gets messy every us as well
and you can see now that there is quite
an obvious line between my neck and my
face which I'm not going to blend in
because something that I forgot to do
what I went to school I always walk
around with the light on my face which
is just so sexy okay and just to show
you the difference in the Foundation's
you can see on this side of my face
everything is just like a lot more skin
light and that's what you achieve with
the beauty blender I find that there's
just like amazing for making things look
really natural then on this side you can
see that it is a little bit more like
what's going on and by using our fingers
as well everything's just a lot more
like oh I'm blended I definitely need
some of these right now we've been good
oh god I must be doing it with your
thing is I always forget I can't we use
to do that every day and now when it
comes to concealer I'm going to use a
concealer which is a few shades lighter
than my foundation as opposed to
something which is literally why because
my foundation and what you don't want to
do what you want to avoid doing is
applying a lot of concealer like in a
big triangle like this
that's all you never want to do why not
one Dale again using our fingers we're
going to try as best as we can to blend
this product into the skin okay so this
is what we're left with now so as you
can see there's like a big unblended
lined everything too much product it's
just impossible to blend out really
discourage this madness so for the other
side of my eye I'm taking this
Maybelline fit me concealer and I'm
using literally the smallest amount and
taking my Beauty Blender I'm just going
to put it underneath my eye first
so that's the most of the concealer
sticks - and then I blend it outwards so
all the excess I blend outwards but I
really don't go much further than kind
of here like the tail of my eyebrow kind
of don't pass that at all so you can see
really my face is looking like lots of
different colors so you can see with a
darkness that the concealer looks very
unnatural this side is just looking a
lot more natural and flawless and my
foundation is oxidizing which means it's
getting a bit darker well which is like
such a great idea to set your skin
makeup it just makes it look so much
more flawless and just look like it
brings everything together basically
sometimes like this hourglass ambient
lighting powder color of course this one
is in the shade dim light and I'm going
to tap off the excess of course and what
I do with my powder is that I actually
like bounce it onto my skin like this
I don't drag I've bounced it on assigned
I get the most product onto my skin that
way and by applying powder your skin
makeup is literally changed forever I
get insane it just literally makes the
biggest difference and I also like to
look to use a powder on my neck as well
just that everything is blended
and natural not so much for this guide
which will be using a different kind of
powder we're going to use this to face
deployments with powder for this other
size but we're just going to take this
I'm going to drag it so you can see that
the powder is obviously a lot lighter
than the foundation and we still have a
bit of a line here but because I'm
dragging it onto my skin it's actually
removing some of the makeup underneath
as well what you don't want now we're
going to move on to the brows which oh
my god so let's just say before you
rinse this I've had my bad eyebrow years
where I pretty much did exactly what I'm
telling not to do let's have a flashback
to Danny about six or seven years ago
yep a little ways so you don't want to
do that you don't you just use I anyway
we're going to take the a BH get brows
and dark brown and let me find my brush
and I'm firstly going to show you what I
do not recommend doing so I've put a lot
of product on my brush and I'm eating
the same pressure the whole way and then
going down like that
and then I strongly do not recommend
making a block at the front like this
which I used to be so good at because it
is very very unnatural and it just sent
out a message of my eyebrows are filled
in today instead of I just have to be
naturally beautiful library I noticed
might look a little bit dramatic but I
swear to god this is what he's actually
got in public like actually a lot of
maize made out of the way that I look
right now
look how ridiculous is everybody then
anyway so with this brown something that
I strongly do not recommend is dragging
the tile down this far because obviously
it's just not natural in fact I used to
even drug it down too
like around here as you can see it just
looks very silly it is the only way to
describe it
and yeah yeah that's all we're going to
say about that what I do suggest when
you fill in your brows even though I'm
still using that product which is quite
dark I change the pressure of my hand
onto my skin to create a different
darkness business color whatever onto my
brow so I tend to start in the middle
like this for the very light hand
following the natural chose my brow so
I'm using the same brush and the same
product but I'm not pressing hard on my
skin at all and then when a lot of the
product is gone I very lightly will fill
in the front and then I will fill in the
bottom of nine and now I will always
suggest no matter how kind the eyebrow
turned out to still need a little bit of
concealer and kind of clean up the line
that you have you just want to make sure
it's like as crisp and nice as possible
so just using a little bit of concealer
I'm just going to clean up the shape of
the brows
I'm just going to take an eyeshadow
pallete alike this one here and when it
comes to eyeshadow you can do whatever
you want you can mix whatever colors you
want to mix but if you are after a very
like natural eye shows that kind of like
goes together and quite well then let's
start with what you should do because
it's the most important totally suggest
getting some public eye brushes yes if
you don't already use eyeshadow brush
and same will change your life so when
it comes to a palette when you look at
an eyeshadow palette the first thing
that you should be thinking of is what
should I be blending outwards into on
your lid it's best to have a transition
shade which means that it kind of goes
from like dark to light so if I wanted
to do something with like a brown smokey
eye I would not put a dark color
anywhere above my lid the dog the dark
color should be on your lid if you want
like the most natural flattering look
so in that case when I look at this
palette I look at what is a really nice
kind of light matte brown and I look at
this shown here called bra I'm going to
dip my brush into that and then I'm
going to tap off the excess when it
comes to applying the eyeshadow I'm very
lightly he's going to pop this on my
crease which is the bit just above my
lid and I'm just going to go back and
forth in very light pen strokes I'm not
pushing down hard at all and then from
that I will go a shade darker so let's
say we go for this one here called pizza
now pizza isn't as light as what I would
ideally want so again tapping off the
excess I am now going to apply a pizza
but very lightly because I don't want it
looks too harsh or anything like that
now that we have this nice little fade
on our eyes it's time to go in with
something like hey girl and to apply
that I'm actually going to use a flat
brush like this one here
and I'm going to put that directly onto
my lid now you can see I need to blend
because there is a line from where that
Brown has stopped so I'm going to go
back in with that big fluffy brush with
pizza and I'm just going to make sure
that Brown is blended in to our
transition shade and the best rule when
it comes to eye shadows that you don't
want to see wearing eye shadow starts or
stops you don't want to see like a line
you want to see a fade okay so now it
just looks like fading outwards
so when it comes to what you shouldn't
do I would strongly suggest avoiding
black eye shadow it will come unless
you're very confident you can clean it
up because pretty much what to go back
you ain't going back it is really you
guys blend that out playing with fire
when it comes to black so if you are
looking at a palette existing like I
want to do a black smoky eye so let's
say that you grab the black color
you don't tap off and let's just say
that you just decide to go and put it
directly onto your eyelid but I'm going
to go like really far and like inner
corner this time and then I'm going to
go up to my eyebrows as well because
when it comes to eyeshadow you really
don't want to go anywhere near your
eyebrow you want to stop above your
crease so you don't want to be dragging
it this far nor do you want to be
dragging it down at all because it will
obviously age you a little bit so when
it comes to your I show you don't just
want to like slap on a little slap on a
color and have it up here so guilty of
this when I was younger I'm not even
kidding what I used to it always my
eyeshadow this high up and then if you
do this I also don't suggest getting a
light color afterwards instead of
actually like blending Spurs like you
see how I went light and then put the
dark on I do not suggest like this doing
dark
and then putting light over the top to
counteract it because it's just very
obvious and it will go gray especially
the black eyeshadow so now when it comes
to bronzing and blush and everything in
between I am going to grab a bronzer
which is quite cool tones
I find that cool tone bronzers are more
flattering in general I think the hoola
bronzer benefit is awesome and it's
something which if you are a bronzer
virgin we just don't really know what to
do definitely suggest this so I always
tap off my excess when it comes to
bronzer because a little oil goes a long
way I actually use most of the product
here and then with the excess that's
when I start to blend it upwards just
with the excess and I stop around here
at my temples
like that so you can see that I just
caught the shadows of my face very
naturally but that's all I'm going to
leave it up but it comes to stuff that
you don't think we want to do you don't
want to get the bronze which is fighting
dark for you no matter how hand you want
to look you can achieve that with you
know a light cool toned bronzer so what
I'm going to do here is I'm going to
really dig my brush into the bronzer and
I'm not going to tap it off and I'm
going to start here and then drag it
backwards starting with most of the
product on my cheekbone and then
bringing it really far down like this so
I'm just going to going on one line and
then finishing really far down so you
can see by covering pretty much your
entire cheekbone in bronzer it just
looks muddy and it just looks very
unnatural so I'm also going to add more
bronzer I'm going to go all the way up
to the middle of my forehead I used to
do this that's what I going to do this
so you can see with that I know it looks
very dramatic but it's just to prove a
point
so yes we go from nice and natural to
dramatic
lots of makeup not very now at this
point I like to use a banana powder this
one is from overarch just a normal
banana powder and I like to just put
this underneath my eyes this will clean
up any eyeshadow fallout as well as kind
of blend that bronzer back to do it my
little triangle that we put the
concealer in before and I find that this
gives a really beautiful like airbrushed
effect so you can see this side you can
see my veins sticking out a little bit
and stuff this side although it looks
like we have less makeup on we actually
have more coverage than we do on this
side so right now we're going to apply
some hot
I'm going to use a highlight which is
like Oprah I believe all the products
I'm using in the description by the way
and you can get 30% off Oprah with my
clothes Danni 30 just in case you want
to say I will leave that information in
the description if you desire this one
is the barley highlight and now I love
OPA highlight posting because for me
they work better than any other higher
that I've ever found they're the most
like flattering and natural and
beautiful ones I like to use a fan brush
like this and when I put it into my
highlighter I am very very very light
with it and I'm still tap that off and I
like to just keep my fan at one place
and then go backwards and forwards just
like that when you have a really natural
glowing pilot
however so what you want to avoid doing
is taking something which is too light
and using too much of it so as you can
see with highlights more isn't
necessarily better and also putting it
like a line down your face is not
necessarily better either so you saw how
light I was you can see how like nice
and glowy that is and that just looks
muddy it looks really weird it's too
much that is such thing as too much
toilet is where so this feels like the
palate once again and personally I
really like putting eyeshadow on my
lower lash line I just like the way it
looks so I like to take let's say this
one here called blue which is a really
pretty orange shade and with that color
I'm going to put a little bit on my
lower lash line and then I'm going to
make sure that it's blended all the way
up so it's almost like a wing and
connects to the rest of my eyeshadow as
well so you can see just like a really
subtle nice extra thing to do on the
bottom of your lash line again I don't
suggest using a dark color on your lower
lash line because it will drag your eye
down so let's say we go
this because black is very hard to learn
and we're not even going to go past it
we're not going to flip it up the way
that I have done there you can see by
that like how immensely different my eye
shape looks because I've just dragged
this side of my face down by a lot so I
looked really big and quite scary and
this side looks a lot more flattering
and I also see this done with eyeliner
in the waterline which can work always
if done correctly
but if you are using a dark eyeshadow
underneath using eyeliner in the
waterline like this isn't necessarily a
good idea okay now let's put on some
mascara I'm eating this Too Faced better
than sex mascara and on this side of my
face I'm just going to make sure that
all my lashes are coated and then I'm
going to put a little bit on the outer
corner of my lower lash line then we're
left with this like very subtle natural
eye look which is easy for everyday use
and then when we go to this side I would
not suggest with your mascara clumping
it by going down a lot and then moving
your mascara without blinking your eye
which is so hard for me to do every cuz
I'm sorry for doing that but I have seen
a lot of my family members do this they
don't blink when they played Emma Skye
they just let you go like this and not a
little product comes off at all and then
when it comes to your lower lashes
you don't really want to make them into
spiders either so when it comes to lower
lashes West is definitely more this says
primed and the sun's not oh my god like
I just I feel like I look
when it comes to lipsticks something you
don't particularly want to do is to go
to light some girls can pull it off
something else really can pull off the
super super super nude like super super
super nude look I am NOT one of those
girls so I'm hoping to show you this is
salty bite art I'm just going to put it
on this half of my face and you can see
instantly that my lips kind of
disappeared which is not something I
particularly like so I like to take a
shade more like rosy by Tarte because
it's a few shades darker and looks
natural weathering so let's take Mac
spice which will look completely fine
with the darker side let me just quickly
learn that now for the other side we're
going to line it too far overboard right
now something like you know it kind of
looks like what you take home but what
you want helping cific surely this is
scaring me oh my god I'm actually
genuinely scared of my own face right
now I feel like I'm doing a lead or okay
but yeah so here's a good side the
finish result of the good side is that
everything is nice and it's natural and
it's not too much I don't like we want
every day it's flattering for my
coloring so we have the line we have the
eyes are going up too high we have to
really like our lips with the lip liner
we have the very intense contour on our
nose the very big eyebrows that's just a
little bit of a hot mess
to be honest we do oh my god I just know
she don't got any way to make up so yeah
I know that it does look quite dramatic
I know I know even I'm terrified right
now because I'm just like who is that
it's just to show you using pretty much
the same product the same eyeshadow is
the same mascara saying I roll product
the things you can achieve by applying
it the correct way so this is just what
I believe is the right way for me to PI
must flattering way for me if there's
anything that are on the side that you
personally like to do yourself keep
going with it there are no rules in
makeup Idol
