since I filmed a monthly favourites it's
actually being used oh my hair is stuck
my eyelash it is actually eight years
since I have filmed a monthly favorites
and I can't believe it I have so many
things that I want to share with you
guys so I figured I'm gonna do one so
everything that I am showing you today
is a hundred percent not sponsored a
hundred percent I'm just in love with it
and want to share it with you because
it's it is so worth the money well worth
the money all the products I'm showing
you are so worth the money it's so
amazing so incredible I kind of have
like three categories I've got like
fragrance and like shower stuff and bath
stuff then I've got I've got a skincare
and I've got makeup as well and the
skincare one is really really really
exciting because it literally saved my
skin and I'm also gonna give you a
skincare tip which I've done and all my
pimples are participating away from
doing it so stay tuned to the end for
that so let's start with the beauty
portion and let's get into it
I ordered a coffee machine last night
and Amazon and it literally arrived half
an hour ago I don't understand why it's
taking me this long to get wearing
copies in my house now I can drink my
iced coffees and I'm so excited I'm kind
of buzzing buzzy I'm excited to get into
this makeup portion so first things
first the foundation of dreams this is
the nice natural radiant long wet
foundation you can already see that I'm
nearly out of it I've been using this
for like only a month or two months or
so and I have the shade Barcelona now
this foundation is amazing in all my
videos over the last few months I've
just been wearing this or something else
which I'm about to show you
I just gives me the best natural radiant
Aloha from a little beauty guru talk
right there but I absolutely love it the
second product which I am loving is the
Giorgio Armani face fabric second skin
makeup the one I have is 5.5 this is my
kind of natural I'm not wearing makeup
makeup if that makes sense so clear and
beautiful which is what I want when I'm
trying to have like a natural day
thing is the hourglass avail powder now
I've been using this underneath my eyes
recently and I just put on with a Beauty
Blender that was a brush that kind of
came with it and I did really like a
brush but I do get more coverage with
Beauty Blender this just sets your
makeup so well makes your skin look
absolutely fantastic my favorite bronzer
of the month is this YSL oh no no I
can't pronounce it
oh my god let less I have less AHA read
it says that that don't line it's
freaking you out sunkissed glow in a 3 I
hope I got the name in this this is what
it looks like on the inside and it is so
nice so this is what I'm wearing today
and I love it so bun double so gorgeous
and I find it also is a little bit sheer
so it gives a really really nice effect
to the blue as well
and speaking of glow I went to the event
for this last week the Becca royal glow
this is so gorgeous
I find that when you put it on it's not
like they can heavy you know how some
highlighters are just a bit like oh and
they don't blend and they're like a
streak this one is just a glow and it's
so sheer it's so blendable it's so
beautiful I love it it's so nice now as
you guys know I've got my eyebrows re
mic related about two weeks ago so I
believe the card two things there there
I'll leave a card anyway so you can see
my before and after my marker blighting
now that it's healed I do still have to
fill in a little bit on the edges just
when I put foundation on eyebrows and I
disappear sometimes but Amy Jean
actually has her own eyebrow range of
products and that's what is a powder
it's so life-changing first of all this
side has a spoolie to my beauty guru
hand
oh my god my hand is so wide I need to
tell my hands anyway it has a bully they
use up one end to brush now the other
side I've got to be really careful when
I open this because it can spill a
little bit this is a powder which you
don't need a brush to apply it onto
eyebrows that make sense powder or sits
in here and when I pull this out we have
this little guy you just do little brush
strokes with this and you get the best
outcome ever
I was shook when I tried this I've spent
so much my life wasted so much my life
with a dip brow pomade with a little
brush thing like in the dip brow pomade
dries out and then you're just like can
you not so this having a powder and a
brush in one is amazing she really
really deserves credit for how good this
is
I am loving this product and it just
saves me so much time that's like the
one way to explain it compared to like a
dip brow this honestly it's just so much
better all right
finally finally and I have a favorite
which is a non favorite which is now a
new favorite because I've rediscovered
my love for it again I love it when I
reuse an old product I'm like I remember
I love this so much it is of course Mac
velvet teddy and this is my absolute
gone Rd I'm wearing her today she is
absolutely stunning I just kind of wish
like hmm I don't really wear lipstick
very often because it comes off and it's
a little bit annoying in that sense I
love liquid lipsticks that don't dry out
your lips are comfortable and lasts all
day so I don't know if there's a velvet
take a liquid lipstick version but if it
is I need my hands on that right now for
now I'm just using the lipstick again
and loving it it's like old school daddy
again
I love it it is now fragrance / shower
slash bar slash candle down all my
favorite things to make my house smell
amazing and to make my body and myself
smell amazing so firstly I think I'm
gonna start with my favorite perfumes of
the month actually three which I love as
you can see Victor raw flour bomb I'm
like halfway out of this bowl this is my
second
halfway through it is amazing you guys
saw that I went to the victory North
event recently celebrating problem
nectar and it is just next is George
Romano see this is the past past passion
passion nici passion with Annie is how
we're gonna pronounce look I love the
normal Georgia I Marnie see that this
one takes it to a whole new level
oh my god it is so good eventually is
like my going-out perfume I find it very
elegant but still like very sweet very
just and the other one is something
which I've only recently been wearing
maybe for the past like week or so and
that is Kara zona and I feel like this
has been doing the rounds on YouTube a
lot and I had it on my mantelpiece since
February and I haven't really used it
and I picked up the other day sprayed it
on again I was like oh my god this is so
good like what am I not using this I
think what I love about this the most is
that it is just so unique it's a scent
which I can't compare to anything else
and I love the bottle shape I love
everything it's just such a cool design
and it smells fantastic
my favorite hand cream right now is
really dirty because I travel with it
absolutely everywhere it's always in my
handbag hence why it's just covered in
like orange things it is the germ alone
English pear and freesia hand cream I
love the English pound freeze yet
perfume I also have it in a body cream
and a hand cream it's just like
delightful and it is such a good size I
do just like travel around with it all
the time whether it is actual travel or
just going to London in my handbag this
is always with me hence why it's a
little bit stained my favorite body wash
I feel so proud and talking about this
right now in a video is this I don't
actually really read what it is it's the
body shops part of the world Adriatic
peony body wash it's a relaxing bath and
shower cream I've just been going
through this way too quick when I put it
on the shower I'm using it every single
day hence why it is currently there I'm
gonna have to get a top-up really soon
because I'm nearly on so luckily there
water shocked and frightened and I heard
that the body shop and Brian was the
first one ever
I don't know that's true someone told me
on a bus once therefore it's true and
the other thing that I've been having in
the bath this small for like if I really
want to pamper myself and go like all
out there it is the German owned velvet
rose and food shower bath oil yeah
shower oil and it is just I love velvet
or as an ode anyway in a candle so to
make my body smell like it it's just
amazing and the German shower oils are
so good because I find that the smell
lasts a long time sometimes with shower
oils the small fades as soon as you get
at the water but this mmm so good oh my
god I feel like I need to do Talia how
often I've said so good should I change
it to noise no favorite candles are of
course would wick you guys saw me buy
these in my hall about a month ago and
my litter box one on Amazon last night
oh my god it smells so good it's
cinnamon chai oh it's nice so I actually
would recommend to you guys to get them
on Amazon I bought this one Anke candle
and they're a lot Internet so that's why
I know on the internet now I feel my
love she's stuck in my hair
who I've been burning this one wall for
hours and it's hardly even like gone
through that is amazing I actually had
like the really long boat kind of shaped
one downstairs and that one's running
out so much quicker than this one so I
feel if you want to get the most use out
of the candles definitely buy this shape
we are finally on the skincare section
I'm really really really excited to
share these products with you because
they've done wonders for me and also
something which I changed what my life
saw someone as for me as well so I'm
gonna start an order of like what I
actually apply them like anyway
so first things first the SA Lauder
advanced night repair eye concentrate
oh my lord this makes my eyes just feel
so deep huffed and just relaxed I
actually put this on before bed and I do
put it on in the mornings I don't know
here any minute on a night but I'm a
rebel he does it twice a day I find that
this works really well because my eyes
obviously get irritated throughout the
day
and this helps it just kind of like
soothes them and after this I put on my
moisturizer and there's two moisturizer
joint so deeply in love with first one
is the Clinique Moisture Surge and the
second one is the LMS pro-collagen
marine cream the Clinique Moisture Surge
is so fantastic that I've got my
boyfriend hooked on it not even kidding
he uses it every single day as well
I am like mmm 3/4 of the way through
this tub and I've already used a little
tub
he's out of his tub because we've just
been loving it today's just is so good
and it really does hydrate your skin for
a really long time because I find with a
lot of moisturizers you put it on it
kind of has that really tackiness anise
like you can just tell there's lots of
chemicals in it and it's just not gonna
last that long this one I wake up the
next morning my skin is still hydrated
so I love that I have been using this
for the last two weeks because I was
actually out of my LMS protic collagen
marine cream this is a brand brand new
tub that was actually sent to me today
because LM s part of the trio Gees and
saw that I was out and sent me sounds
Thank You album s because I love this
I've also got so many people I know in
person hooked on this too because it is
just so good it makes you feel so
hydrated so when I have these two
together my life is complete and I
literally cannot tell you guys how much
you need these in your life what how
much you guys need these in your life
now the next one I saw a lot of people
using and I had it myself and I couldn't
really quite understand how to use it
I'm here because I threw the box the way
ages ago and the actual yeah thing
itself doesn't have directions on it
anyway I watched a video on YouTube as
you do and I learned how to actually use
it and I use this every single day twice
a day and it makes my skin feel amazing
and makes me glow like nothing else
it is the LA roche-posay hi whoa I've
never actually read that before hi Lou
hi Lou I really need to stop trying to
pronounce things because I can't do it
it's a b5 thing it's amazing and it's by
LaRoche Posie I'm sure you can find it
information so is an anti-wrinkle
concentrate it's repairing and plumping
this just I can't even explain it my
skin just look so nice when I put this
on I actually put it on after my
moisturizer I let my moisturizer sit and
then I put this over the top I don't
feel like my skin look was titled doll
since using this it's such a life
changer
finally the Isle of paradise medium self
tanning drops with face and body I've
been using this on my face I've put it
on my face and be like once a week and
you do wake up with a very brown face
the next day my only flight with this
product is that because it is a water
you can't tell when you're putting it on
if you have enough on or if it's gonna
be streaky or Pat you anything which is
kind of annoying but I've always found
when I wake up the next day it's a bit
patchy but the color stays there for
ages that's a difference because if I
use like a normal phone turn on my face
within a day or two days it's gone
completely this I don't want to see
sustains your face that sounds so bad
but you only like tan for a long time
when you have this on and the patchiness
what kind of stuff does disappear after
a day or two days of showering I find
but once you hit like the second day and
the patchiness is faded and you just got
a nice bronze glow it's amazing it's so
good and it's better than any face that
I've used in terms of like its longevity
Holmwood and also just like the color
and the glow that it gives you it's
amazing now I said I had a skincare tip
as well to show you guys at the end and
I'll share with you before I forget now
this is not something it's gonna work
for everyone
unfortunately because it's totally down
to the way your body digests things chow
down to like so many factors all that
aside if you are finding that you are
getting heaps and heaps and heaps and
heaps of pimples around this area and
this area like I have been in my videos
you guys have seen what I'm not wearing
my makeup I've been breaking out a lot
in this side and you can see right now
there are no pimples on this face at all
and I'm on my period and there are no
pimples so how did I do it I cut out
dairy again I know I cut out dairy like
two years ago but then for some reason
like two or three months ago
I just had ice cream again - the first
time and I was like oh my god
and then I had like yogurt so then I was
drinking milk again and I just literally
introduced Terry right back into my life
every single day was consuming dairy in
one way or another and my skin went so
bad like all around my cheeks just
flaring up with so many pimples and I
have heard that your cheeks are
digestion like every part of your face
means a different thing when they break
out your mouth hormonal and your cheeks
on digestion so I was like alright I'm
gonna test it I'm not gonna eat any
dairy except chocolate mmm for the next
week and see what happens to my skin and
the fact that I'm on my period like
third day in and my skin is clear is
unheard of the clearest has been in
absolutely ages and for me it's from
switching from normal dairy to almond
milk and from normal boundaries to
non-dairy Bernie juries like they taste
exact same and it's just amazing that
they actually have that option as well
I've never been to a doctor about it so
I'm not going to say I'm lactose
intolerant no been diagnosed as being
lactose intolerant but I do know that
when I eat consume dairy etc my tummy
doesn't agree with me either let's just
leave it at that
so I shouldn't really be eating it at
all so I'm gonna stop now I've learned
my lesson I've been punished for my face
and that's that but my skin has cleared
up so much we've got no filtering on my
camera and comparing it sort of like in
my previous makeup stores from the last
few weeks I cannot believe it it's I'm
officially in love tell me favorites
because I'm so passionate about these
products like I love the most so much
and so genuinely that I need to start
doing this every single month again I
need to start showing you my favorite
things because it's just fun I love this
so much because there's just so much
actual genuine love here so everything
that I've mentioned today will be listed
in my description and it'll be super
super easy for you guys to find
everything that I mentioned so just
check it down below and click on the
links and until next time guys have an
amazing week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
