today I'm filming a first impressions on
the Maybelline fit me matte and for this
foundation I have recently got my hands
on this and I'm really excited to try it
I have tried the Jewett long before but
that made my face so it's 20 looking so
I'm hoping this one works a little bit
better for me my skin type is normal so
it's not too dry and it's not too oily
it's really excited to try this like I
really want to find a nice drugstore
foundation because high-end are a little
bit too pricy so it'd be nice to find a
nice drugstore one and the reason why I
am filming on my dining room table today
is because I wanted to use only
artificial lighting up to great start
I wanted these only natural lighting so
you can see the foundation for what it
looks like in person
fine if you're wondering about this bad
boy right here you've been following me
for ages you know that was like my end
of school project and this is meant to
be Cara Delevingne
gonna ask I painted that like so long
ago I really want to get back into
painting mmm but let's get straight back
onto the topic and look at makeup is in
the shade 3 110 Sun beige it's quite a
yellow all of your color too much just
fake tan right here it does not have a
pump which is always a little bit in my
books I love pumps unfortunate doesn't
come with a pump like most drugstore
foundations they hardly ever come with
pumps it says that it's for normal to
oily skin it mattifies and refines pause
matches your natural skin tone its
natural seamless finish and then it's
all in French sorry I'm gonna give this
a go and see how it works to me and I'm
going to use a Beauty Blender to apply
this today and I'm not using primer
because I want to see how long the
foundation last on its face so let's
jump straight into it if you hear like
wind chimes it's so in the outside so
that's what that noise is so now that my
hair slicked back and I look marvelous
we're gonna get started with this so I'm
just gonna
put this on my hand because there is no
pump unfortunately so there's no smell
like this sniff Foundation
there's no smell okay
it is such a good color
yay color match is amazing it's matching
my turn
very well so the coverage isn't that
heavy I mean just sort of like evening
out your skin tone but it's not super
full coverage phony looks very beautiful
which I like so you're not gonna like
look too much like okay yes so that the
colors matching really well actually
to yellow to pink
my neck is tiny bit darker but it always
is cuz its effect there anyway but I
actually like how it's not a really
heavy coverage because it means that
this is great for like an everyday
foundation because stuff like my F say a
lot of double wear when I wear that
every day it's just it's just too heavy
for my face the foundation is now
completely on I think that my first
impression of it is I love it
I love the color I love the coverage I'm
gonna do a flash test now to see what it
looks back but it looks like with flush
back I don't think that it has it so if
it doesn't have SPF in it then it
shouldn't have a flashback and I will
check in with you guys in a few hours
right now it is 10:32 a.m. I'll come
back at college and I'll let you know
how it's gone I can see some line
starting I swear I get this problem with
every single drugstore foundation I get
lines everywhere
hey guys it's now lunchtime this welcome
to Australia my sounds like way too
bright so I've been wearing my
foundation now for about four hours so I
thought I would just do it could little
update you guys so far so good
I'm loving it I've noticed a few creases
like on my mouth and stuff they're not
besides that it's looking great
I know that my eye makeup today is
horrendous I just can't seem to get a
rise it's like but the foundation is
working that's the main things so far
I'm very happy with it I am looking
forward to seeing the holds up all day
cuz that would be amazing if it does and
yeah I will check in with you guys
tonight and we'll see how it lasts the
other day hey guys it's now 5:00 p.m.
you can't even see that anyway um I'm
about to leave my filming house now
except to drive home so I thought I'd do
my final update I've had this on since
10 o'clock this morning and it's looking
pretty damn good hasn't really bunched
at all
and I really like this foundation I
would definitely compare it to double
wear buy or sell order hands down this
is my favorite drugstore foundation now
I love it so I would really recommend
you guys try it out it's amazing and
that's all I have to say I am in love
with it see you next time guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
