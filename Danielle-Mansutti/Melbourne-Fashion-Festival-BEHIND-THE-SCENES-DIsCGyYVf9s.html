channel and welcome to this vlog today
I'm so excited because she'll have given
me the exclusive opportunity to attend
the Virgin Australia in Melbourne
fashion festival today it is day two of
the festival and I'm so pumped
it is about 38 celcius outside so I'm
hoping my makeup is not going to
completely smut of today fingers crossed
so I shall have invited me there I'm
going to be looking at the latest trends
in Footwear and now okay I am actually
someone who is a little bit
self-conscious of bare feet I always
have been I feel like my toes and my
feet are a little bit through so
unshelled sorry about their new wet and
dry electronic foot file I was so
excited about it because it actually
makes you pee it's so beautiful and
healthy and that is the whole reason why
I am attending today is to spread the
word about this new product as well so
here I have all of their amazing
products which they have sent out to me
this one is the one that I am so excited
about this one is the wet and dry
rechargeable foot file it is
rechargeable and cordless and it can be
used dry or used in the bath or shower
this one it's going to make my feet look
so beautiful and then we have the above
it's smooth nail care oil and over here
is one you've probably seen on YouTube
before I've seen a lot of youtubers use
this it is the electronic nail care
system and it's for natural-looking
shiny Nails and then over here we have
the wet and dry roller heads as well so
if it was not for these beautiful
products
today's whole vlog would not be possible
propaganda bump into so many influential
people models beautiful people of the
world and I can't wait but as many of
you know when it comes to fashion I'm a
little bit like but I will be taking you
along with me
to the festival today and I hope you're
as excited as I am and let's hope my
makeup doesn't sort off my entire face
today
okay well just pop my car and I have
absolutely no idea how to get to the
Fashion Festival from here but we're
going to try and find it I think I found
it latest doing the new now that Beck
had all about stopping the show just
during the clinical wails around
so I'm here would be a beautiful Sam
Harris we're going to be talking about
all things Footwear and nail care and
all that kind of stuff so tell us a
little bit about what you've been doing
there yesterday was the first day
okay and I was lucky enough to be and
they
right so that's what I've done this week
and I want to
that's like sister whichever when it
comes to nail care everything new trends
popping up recently we've colors or news
anything like that
well with last night's show there now
train was all kind of you know neutral
tones you know soft pinks and things
like that which is a little bit of a
change considering you know we're going
into autumn and winter yeah yeah yeah
when it comes to your Footwear and stuff
like that have you seen any trends for
autumn that are coming up that you can
tell us about there's a lot of cool
boots coming in the overseas and the
water winter because we are going really
want to be wearing sandals you can no
judgment
yeah definitely a lot of foods a lot of
like black through time in my life
lifestyle really matter
Oh beautiful so when it's more of a
casual kind of day what are your sort of
favorite go-to nail colors and brands
especially for Priceline okay if I'm not
modeling or anything like that
actually don't tend to where I'm like
that I was always getting done but if
I'm going on holiday or something I
always stick to like the nice kind of
creepy yeah and they go with everything
oh yeah because you're walking all the
time and I'm sure you fit that very time
for what everything how do you keep your
beautiful I'm really good but yeah I am
wearing heels all the time and the most
comfortable shoes to wear I
the instance of fashion shows every I
think I think this sounds weird but I'm
a first told me last night that
introspective faith in black ops leader
in warm water and if you have blisters
coming it gets rid of it obviously not
really but just now oh I'm gonna use
that I have you know an event or
something on yeah looking red
carpet-ready exactly and do you think
it's always important to feel confident
with the way your feet are looking oh
yeah thank you so much for stopping by
and chatting with us appreciate it so
much and yeah we hope you had a nice
time relaxing today watching the shade
working in tomorrow tomorrow is awesome
that was my first time ever interviewing
someone that was so nervous but Sam is
beautiful and such a gorgeous girl so
interesting as well to learn about the
nail care and the shoes and all that
kind of stuff from an actual amazing
huge model so it's great I am sweating
my face off right now it is so really
hot I bumped into Chloe Morello before
so it's all very very very exciting
today
30 and surround five now so we just
gonna wipe in a bot a little while I'm
just gonna say hey forbidden boys
so I am leaving the Fashion Festival now
it was an amazing day I met so many
amazing people as well it was so
interesting looking at it from a
different angle for more of the whole
foot we're now looking outside because
it's something that was really
interesting what's actually thought
about it because it's something you
don't really think about that much so
now it's time for me to head home do if
you enjoyed this blog it was so much fun
and I can't thank Priceline and shoal
enough for letting me attend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
