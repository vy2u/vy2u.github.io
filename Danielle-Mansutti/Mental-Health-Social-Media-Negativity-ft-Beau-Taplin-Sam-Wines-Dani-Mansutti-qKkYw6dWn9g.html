podcast style video I'll try and get us
on iTunes as well as to listen to the
audio only
but I'm joined by to my favorite people
in the world if you like introduce
yourselves I'll put you on the spot I'm
Bo chaplain and I don't you have a book
coming soon as well yes so I have a book
coming out called worlds of view through
HarperCollins I've been self-published
for about five years and I'm really
excited about it yeah it's gonna be
exciting to see how it all transpires
hello I'm Sam I am a model I am a small
business owner what would you say is a
self proclaimed science nerd or thought
provoker I'm sure most people watching
this would have some knowledge of both
writing on Instagram and I will link
everything in the description for you
define both of these and lovely men but
in today's podcast we're going to be
talking mostly about social media mental
health I just want to do it like a
really casual setting so we're just at
boys play so we're just gonna be more
casual cuz we're not putting the other
night and I think one thing that struck
a chord with me is just the fact that I
don't have a lot of knowledge when it
comes to men's mental health and their
perspective on everything because I know
everything from my own perspective but I
feel that that is probably the biggest
issue which doesn't really come to the
surface so many men can struggle with it
but there's just no one's really
standing up and saying much about it and
I feel that I would love to come from a
place to help these men but I find it
very difficult because I don't fully
understand their perspective well I'll
talk a little bit about my experiences
with that I've come from a world where
all my friends we've always been very
close for emotions that the whole in
each of my friendship groups have always
been a place where we can be open and
talk about our issues but I also always
saw a worlds of men where they weren't
so comfortable I was fortunate in my
first year outside of after high school
I am was working in a furniture business
just delivering office furniture sitting
it all up wasn't using my mind in any
kind of way I had no idea what I wanted
to do with the rest of my life
and I started suffering communiques OCD
induced kind of anxiety that kind of
expressed itself there's something
called recurrent thoughts where you get
this uncomfortable thought in your head
and morning tonight you can't stop
thinking about it nothing you can do you
can't escape it I have a feedback loop
yes I just think about it and then that
makes you think about it even more which
brings on anxiety and possible person
then yeah I can anger it yourself for
thinking about it and then that just
makes you more than think about more
yeah yeah there's definitely a
psychological name for that I can cut my
own butcher for the longest time I
thought I wouldn't escape it I thought
this was just gonna be my life forever I
thought something happened and this was
just gonna be it I was fortunate because
I eventually opened up to my mom which
is the hardest thing and she suggested
she sent me to a psychologist and was
actually the psychologist who suggested
I first started writing in first place
before that I never did any writing or
anything like that she suggested it as a
way of putting my thoughts down and
thinking about myself more and
what's going on and and that turned out
to be the answer for me once as soon as
I started using my mind and heart on a
daily basis the problem went away the
answer will be different for all kinds
of people but my point is that I was
fortunate enough to have family who are
proactive in my mental health if I never
got sent to that psychologist who knows
where I'd be right now and then the
problem is they're not not all men not
all people do have these support
networks in their own lives yeah I agree
it's fascinating that you said as well
it's sort of writing things down which
which can sort of be like a release or
like a relief it's like it's funny to
think that I was actually listening to a
podcast about this sort of stuff about
how people our age have a lot of
existential angst and like a lot of
issues and I mean anyone knows but like
anyone who's holding on to issues from
the past or just issues in general it's
like normally if you write them down if
you write down your thoughts and feeling
so just get them out
can see it it does it does wonders to
into your mental health and then it's
almost as I said almost like a like a
sigh of relief and then sort of like
I've definitely not before like I don't
take a regular journal but if there's
something that I'm thinking about all
churning over in my head I might write
it down or there's a few good apps that
I've used to to do that but it's I think
that's a very important thing to put out
that especially the people who might not
write you know if if you can't find
anyone to talk about this sort of stuff
at least write it down and then it's
almost like your voice is being heard
sort of thing even if no one sees it
it's still like yeah very therapeutic
I think there's been times well with
because I these days tend to be more of
a speaker that a writer sometimes I can
actually even just like on the webcam
just film what I want to say and then
delete it but I've just said it out loud
I've got it out of my mind and you just
you know be Charlie be but no I mean
especially in England this is a big time
gap between about 9 a.m. and 6 p.m.
where most of my friends
obviously a party and that makes it a
bit hard if I need to talk someone at
that specific time that can be a little
bit hard and with the NHS in England it
takes months to see a therapist and
everything like that so I'm on a little
path to try and discover how to do that
or better yet privately but I do think
that therapy is such an important thing
and something which I feel is kind of
either it's it's misjudged in a way
because when you say that you're getting
therapy people kind of like oh my god
what happened to you did you have like a
traumatic horrible experience but it's
like yeah I'm just talking with someone
who's kind of helping me understand my
mind and I think that's the most
important thing because when I first got
it I not like I felt like ashamed but I
was kind of like wow I've got to the
point what I need therapy like I'm a
broken person but then once I didn't all
she did was listen to me and then just
change my perspective absolutely and
then say this is why you behaving this
way and always kind of stuff in it it is
life changing anyone who is a good
listener who is willing to sit there and
listen to someone talk and empathize
with them which is something that we
aren't really taught to do with you know
no one really teaches you how to be a
good listener right but if you if you
genuinely show interest in someone and
what they're talking about doesn't
matter what their issue might be as I
said it could be anxiety about just not
knowing what they're going to do when
they finished uni it could be just move
to a new kind
there's no as many people as I know and
the beta Sega crap compared to Australia
and the weather's crap and everything
else is crap except the fashion it's we
fashion it well it's been really good
but yeah I think it's um as long as
someone is there just to talk to and I
think everyone it's so isolated in in
this day and age and this so but so much
was social stigma surrounding talking
about if you're not feeling good like
everyone think about it almost no one
says aren't feeling pretty bad when you
ask someone how they like I yeah good
are you busy like no one really will go
oh yeah feel like like oh yeah and
then most I'll give you is like I'm
tired yeah so much there's there is so
much of a negative stigma around feeling
anything else but good and in reality
it's it's a pendulum you've got you
can't have the good without the bad you
know and if it's all good then that
becomes your baseline and so then
suddenly you're what used to be good is
just normal yeah strive for more so it's
like it's there's always gonna be yeah
but then there's also that with social
media and I mean I can obviously I am
part of the problem in a way but I have
changed the way that I speak about it
now because hmm as we're saying like a
lot of the time you do find yourself as
I say you're comparing your behind the
scenes to someone else's highlight reel
but you don't realise that like you just
back in the day and used to see
celebrities and they were like this
unattainable amazing person that
everyone looked up to you and had these
amazing lives but now we're in a world
where everyone we know is that like
celebrity and they're kind of showing
their like best parts of their lives or
you know how much fun they're having but
when it comes down to it if you are
having the most fun time and well when
you're out would you really be
snapchatting it yeah like to have to
consciously think like I need to say to
most people can see that I'm out in
doing something that's like an anxiety
within like trying to fit into it for
some people it's so much like they feel
if they don't document it it didn't
happen correct
and it's definitely that I think there's
a lot of there's a lot of stuff in
society that's like you need to prove
that you've done something we do show
everyone and and and generate Envy
amongst people be like oh did you see
someone says howl
demain or whatever he's like and it's
fascinating to see how that's happening
and it's like all to get attention and I
mean again I'm the same as you want to
part of the I'm a part of the problem
but I'm very aware of it and I never
pretend that the life that I live on
social media is my actual life
ironically it's what I do full-time so
it is but like I never I never pretend
that you know it's not orchestrated for
the most part of it and I guess the
irony of that it was like every time
that I do post like a more casual or
candid show probably tend to get a
better reception than my own the most
sort of structured ones but yeah I think
it's a fascinating because it's almost
like as you said it no one really wants
to admit that is just their highlight
reel it's the same weed traveling like
80% of traveling is yeah like it's
just like that's why it costs a lot of
money it's a crap hotel and that's why I
would say then you get want to say that
it's human it's human nature to to be
doing these things so the highlight reel
and I'm just showing what they come to
me with and what makes it life seem
exciting and you know that's just the
way the world is right now and that's
and that's why it's our responsibility
more than ever as community as as a
human being as human beings society to
really also show the other side that's
showing the challenges and absolutely
promote these conversations and getting
and get people talking about what's
important so we're not just distracted
by everything else that's happening and
we're talking about real things I
couldn't agree more
the more time people spending on social
media the more we need to be having
talking about everything that happened
yeah definitely when you're feeling down
you post a really good photo it's that
kind of boosting self-esteem or I kind
of stuff right so I think I can't do a
good mr. science here we'll help me out
on this I'm pretty sure I've heard on a
podcast as well they said that because
social media is it is like a drug to us
cuz we are yeah it's it's it's of course
the pleasure in general is almost like
an addiction yeah yeah yeah
so like the pleasure of like the
insatiable shopping the eating
everything you can that's super like
high fat and all this sort of stuff like
sex like everything posting on social
media all that sort of stuff it's all
like to try and feel like feed this
sense of gratification and all that sort
of stuff and it's it's it's an
interesting one to see how it like this
sort of like pursuit of happiness and
how people will sort of yet try to only
focus on the positive and it's like that
maybe there's so much to learn from
negative things that happen in your life
like that to me like I learned the most
what most people would assign as a
negative thing to go on in your life but
I think that you learn so much more from
your mistakes you learn so much more
from times when you're feeling
vulnerable and exposed and I think we
need to sort of foster this sense of you
know you should be able to talk to
someone and be vulnerable with someone
but it is hard to sort of perpetuate
that and society as I said because
especially for a male like opening up
and being like I'm feeling really
vulnerable about this like how many how
many you never say that in movies you
never say that in anything it's always
like I'm like Superman I'm a man
nothing nothing goes wrong with me it's
like so I think there's a stigma that
makes men feel like they can't just open
up I mean we had a like a beautiful
conversation about this a while back and
I think we addressed most of the issues
there unfortunately that was no
but the man who listened to its how is
he approach this and any congratulate us
but for the speaking about these things
people are dying for these conversations
they wanted a they want to hear them hmm
and it's our responsibility to start
breathing today yeah
catalyst for change and do you find that
with your work is well you find do you
ever hear men kind of sending messages
like appreciating that you're actually
opening up about things as well they
feel they can't really put down into
words and stuff of course yeah I do
receive maybe two or three is mostly
female but more comfortable to send me
emails and going to it but I do get two
or three emails from from guys at least
you at least once a week they're always
just so grateful that that they have a
place that they can they can open up and
and buy their thoughts and and not feel
ashamed for it cuz they run out here
there are a lot of men writing poems and
know when you think about it it used to
be such a I mean it was very
male-dominated like back in the day lest
you do certain types of suppression and
all that sort of stuff and I wouldn't be
surprised if a lot of the male poetry
was actually written by a female and a
male was used as a vessel to sort of get
that out there but I mean yeah it never
used to be the case it used to be one of
the sexiest things ever I mean but at
the same time like we've got a lot of
like people who transitioned into music
so a lot of the your poets and stuff
like that we would have written down
words now might might be a Justin Bieber
song I'm at an issue I guess maybe not
the best ever but the issue is that once
you get to that level you no longer like
really can or do write about genuine
things see I think it's moving in a kind
of
direction I've been watching the last 10
years and I feel like the direction
everyone is going is improving I feel
like for a while Serena crashed and it
was really negative and superficial I
can see it like I'm really optimistic
but I say moving in a cool direction
saying when I feel that for me I just
didn't matter who it was if I was buying
anyone that kind of gave me this
unrealistic standard of life and would
make me feel down it's not their fault
my own issues making me feel that way I
just decided to unfollow heaps of
accounts that would make me feel like
not worthless but like really low
self-esteem and stuff like that and I do
find now I try and actively follow
accounts that inspire me or motivate me
and stuff and just surround myself with
that I kind of just like ignore
everything else you see that pattern
with everyone as well yeah yourselves
people are gravitating towards people
who are real ends and speak about
important things like I really do feel
like was only so much value that you can
get out of a shallow superficial
relationship right I mean on the surface
you might be like them I'm gonna be like
the best but you see all the time it's
like celebrity relationships and I mean
there's so much any girl you've got so
so long but it's like yeah finding that
genuine connection with everyone like
you can you can have a genuine
connection with literally anyone you
meet if they're willing to open up but
for some reason people are not willing
to do so as much these days everyone has
their sort of guard up and not many
people are trustworthy in how you would
always try and sort of encourage people
to think about why they might think
something so for example like when you
said you fought you unfollowed a whole
bunch of the cast that made you feel I
was comparing myself to them yeah I was
yeah and so I guess I'd say like why why
why did you then compare them to
yourself and then like again my
projecting your own insecurities onto it
but then if you're aware that that's
what you're doing it's a weird thing
because I could be in two minds about
half of me knows
a lot of the stuff that I compare myself
to on Instagram especially in the female
world a lot of it is photos so much
festival it's just really good angles
really good lighting with filters or if
they are beautiful like that's amazing
and good for them
but it's hard because I think because
it's my job when I live and breathe
social media as well that I have to
constantly be on there I can often find
myself in times where I might come
across someone who does what I do and
there they might be succeeding more than
I am and stuff and then it makes me feel
like why don't people like me like what
am I doing wrong maybe it's nothing to
do with a total and like I'm learning
that now but I think it's a process with
me just saying we're completely
different people and I've had to learn
the whole classic like not to compare my
chapter to size chapter 20 yeah not just
that as well like you mean instead of
thinking of that way like frame it in a
different way we like I'm so glad that
this person is doing so well exactly I
would love to do this well and hopefully
one day I can like you can always frame
something not that I'm saying just be
overly positive about everybody you can
always frame something in a way that is
beneficial for you so much easier to be
negative about anyone or anything than
it used to be positive yeah so you have
to be actively aware and doing that so
it's thing what do you think because a
competitive spirit is super important if
you see someone doing well and you're
like I want to do that I can do that
that's really positive and that's really
beneficial because it's when you start
looking at the people in it in kind of a
toxic way or a negative
that's where it can do a lot of damage
and does nothing useful to you so that's
it sorry sorry a lot of the time that's
what leads to like online abuse because
for some it's not the case but for the
majority of people that do write nasty
comments online they're actually deep
down they're quite unhappy and envious
and you do find that when you like when
I'm in that situation where I pay myself
to someone and you know just feeling bad
about myself instead of being like they
are doing amazing I just think I'm not
doing as good as them but for some
people can lead to them trying to drag
them down to their level and be like I
don't want you up here anymore I want to
like jump above you and stuff like that
and that's where it can get really toxic
I think and I think with social media as
well it's so easy to get your voice out
and to attack song but back when it was
celebrities and self thing like 10 15
years ago maybe just a blemish on ya
know so as you said it's one of those
things that it's so easy to hide behind
a keyboard it's so he's a hard behind
the screens like you don't have to look
at someone in the face and say that
there's even anyone who said those stuff
had to look you in the face and say that
yeah exactly right and anyway I don't
have much time to talk about this stuff
because I think that I understand that
it can get you but I think it's not even
worth batting an eyelid like not even
worth considering okay it's just not
worth it like but if you have any not
the kind of scene I know but I think
that's cuz negative is always you always
want think more about the Navy than the
maza that's just any night sort of human
thing but I mean you just got to think
about it's like if they're you should
need instead of being like oh that's so
painful to maybe like man that I could
put yourself in issues like man it must
I feel so sorry if you have to exactly
express themselves like that like how
how upset and and sad can you be to feel
the need to criticize someone in a way
that imagine if you did that to them
like David don't be broken like
definitely I'm not always prefer to be
the person
saves the nasty Co and I'm giving it I
think it's just such a waste of energy
worrying about what other people say
yeah about you and and as I said but I
can still understand why why you might
think that but it's to me it's like I I
are you getting it no not really but I
mean I'm not at the same level as I
would say you are girls and guys don't
necessarily think any differently if you
separate them and you grow them in
situations where the social construct
won't dictate how they behave and how
they do things I think that men and
women would think very similar although
sure we have some certain biological
differences I wouldn't I would say that
you know sure women women in society
tend to be a lot more manipulative with
verbally manipulative because that
doesn't mean that they are they just
genetically art but it's because of in
which the society we live in like a
woman comes gonna punch another girl on
the face you'll get so much more
negative sort of stuff for showing
aggression and what a male would so you
sort of learn that psychological
manipulation and especially with men
like if you said something to us we
could just literally pin you down and be
like no like so women have learned to
have to be a bit more psychologically
manipulative so therefore I would say
that they're more instead of trying
fists they'll throw verbal insults and
they'll get into your mind like to say
it and just you be manipulative and that
works that's you know it traces it all
the way back to like schoolyard bullying
because if guys have an issue that it's
normally you know a punch on or
something but with girls it's like
whispering and excluding and it's like
little tiny jobs that will make that
girl feel incredibly lost and confused
and it's psychological yeah
psychologically horrendous the the stuff
that goes on with girls I mean and I
just feel so I'd so upsetting to think
that that happens and is perpetuated and
I just yeah I don't know I wish everyone
was a little bit more self-aware but
it's like when like how how do you even
make that happen
so it's such a hard and tricky topic and
as I said the only thing you can do is
be a better person yourself and
but be empathetic and understanding you
can't go out and try and change everyone
you have to change it run by changing
yourself and if someone says something
negative you sort of take it on board
and then say something back that they
just wouldn't expect and then it makes
them realize ah you know I'm the bad
person not yeah but I think like you say
I found that these days I'm a lot more
like opening myself online and if I do
have a bad day I'm like I'm having a bad
day like I don't sugarcoat it anymore
and by being that way and also being
incredibly self-deprecating which is
what I'm like a plus that all the time
people have less to pick your part on
yeah this is me and I know that things
are my faults I'm working on it house
with no curtains has nothing to hide and
it's so important you pull back the
curtains and you show them your shitty
messy house and you're so awkward anyway
so back to the house with no Curtis yeah
well yeah you just be completely open
and honest about everything going and
yet you're right people can't pick it
apart so much because it's all their
property and it's real and it's raw and
everyone's got it everyone's got these
challenges and actually the people who
are generally saying these cruel things
you know they feel really isolated most
likely live their lives and that'll
weird
perhaps not in every case but a lot of
the time it's a it's a weird way of
reaching out and I think it's not
accessibility should yeah it is so
it comes from a negative place
absolutely so we are in I'm not in you
know I'm not sure happens the place
you're in or myself or you but it's if
we're in okay places and it's our
responsibility to then just spread a
more positive message as much as we can
because we gotta understand that
negativity negativity isn't coming from
a yeah a hateful place it
would be coming from a damaged or
isolated place right those of you that
have been farming for a while you know
that Sam I went to Switzerland you're
going on a trip somewhere we can we can
film this in the Swiss Alps or yes yes I
think that the inspiration that you
could get the variety of onboard ways in
the night yeah but we went to this time
last year and even back then I was a lot
more affected by absolutely things
people said online and I like it it does
take time to grow a thick skin you know
it's not something that you can just
like wake up one day and like this
doesn't affect me anymore it's something
that I've had to learn I don't I don't
get upset by comments anymore irony I
only take it personal if I know them
personally No so I've had to learn to
just deal with it in that way but I do
think also just in the past year so I've
just kind of discovered more so Who I am
and being okay with it and I think that
we why doesn't affect me I was gonna say
I think it's it's not so much getting
thick skin is not deal with it like of
course those words hurt I can that would
hurt anyone but it's yeah it's a weird
one I don't look like removing your skin
completely yeah exactly
I think it's the opposite it's not about
building up a thick skin it's been like
one like hit me with what you've got
that's not I love it I Know Who I am and
regardless of what you think you know of
me as like you don't live my life and
you therefore do not know who I am but
if you're comfortable enough with who
you are as an individual same goes for
everyone out there by the way as long as
you comfortable with who you are as an
individual you have genuinely
introspectively looked at yourself and
you know what it is and what it isn't
that you like and dislike about yourself
and you
try and make changes positive changes in
your life then anything anyone says
that's sort of negative it's like I
think it's a lot of people comment or
message me saying that they want to you
know start an Instagram study each other
but they're scared about what people
will say or they'll judge them and stuff
and all three of us are on such means
for different reasons essentially and I
think that regardless of what someone
says to you you always just have to
acknowledge that it's not your problem
it's theirs and then if you have a
passion for something to just do it and
I think even for sadly primarily does
like fashion posts and stuff he has a
lot to offer about what goes on in his
head as well because he's incredibly
like science mind and fascinating in
that way because when I listen to you
talk about stuff I'm just like but I
think Beau and I we are almost too
sometimes like we're like this is us
this is raw and like here's everything
that's going on my head but I think
we've gotten past the point now it's
like caring sweet when I actually when I
first started writing I just awful I
just used to write lick bassist Ryan
lips with Kirsten like every single
pollen that's that was my one and I
stick I used to get a lot of flack about
it like people used to make fun of it
all the time and but I used to just I
was blindly confident about it for some
weird reason but I had such low
self-esteem in my life when you met me
last year when you met me last year you
could I was a lot more confident and yes
just socially awkward and but I was
blindly confident but I'm always finally
confident about my writing over this
last year I've done a lot of personal
growth and I found my confidence again
and I'm a lot more stable and who I am
as a person
but now weirdly I have more doubts about
my writing there's always new challenges
you progress any challenge it is a dress
that's because as you said you prior to
that you had bigger fish to fry than is
my writing okay yeah that's from now now
that now that you've you've transcended
what were your your your initial
problems now you come up and now you can
think about you some other things and
then you're like it's like okay if you
know your writing then you might be like
where's my yard problems are never gonna
go away all they're gonna do is evolve
into another type of pump and you set of
challenges and you need them you
constantly need new challenges and
obstacles to progressing shape yourself
into a better human being now you should
write it you should write it what do you
call the motivational like like to speak
a deck of cards
oh you've already what you call it but
tap into Taplin yeah because you do kind
of want to make that other stuff as well
what do you feel hearty back I think
that people will make excuses for
anything if they want to you kill me
humans will rationalize any decision
they make after they make the decision
so intuitively you might make a decision
and then your your rational brain will
go oh well I did it because it is XYZ so
I would say if I want to you I
would say that I just don't have enough
time or I'm focusing on my business the
moment which they're both fellas but I
mean realistically it's just like I need
to just something people take the leap
yeah I just need to pull with my finger
in my ass but I guess the main problem
for me is it's a bit different
beauty and stuff like if I come along
sure I've got a commerce degree and a
science degree in biology but like I
don't have a PhD or a master's who am I
to be this voice of authority on
anything like I I haven't published any
scientific journals I haven't like from
an academic point of view I'd be a
laughingstock so like yeah so I think
but then again I and I've realized over
time now now after reading a lot more
and other sort of stuff that it's like
even academics like I have plenty of
friends who academics who are would
nowhere near as conscientious or aware
of anything and there so it was like
super narrow minded and you just like oh
you're just like anyone else you're just
hyper intelligent but you still haven't
thought of things from a
multidisciplinary perspective and it's
like I realized that you know like after
I read all this of stuff like I just
need to talk about it because at the end
of the day people want to someone they
can relate to it they can tease I think
would like to like the most the most
popular science Facebook page is just a
regular guy people just need people who
are passionate about stuff which ones
that is that IFLS yeah yeah he's just a
regular guy yeah and he's got all these
people you know not everything he poses
that scientific bit he's got people
passionate and caring that stuff and
that's what it needs is people I'm not I
never wanted to be a writer I'm not a
writer I'm not a novelist or and I went
to uni or anything like that
oh yes Will Smith the disparage I'm not
I'm just a regular guy and that's the
thing is that people just need regular
people sharing their messages I couldn't
even equipment grinia
whatever they're passionate about could
be really even what you're not
passionate about I'm not overly
passionate about what I do but I know
that I can do it well and component and
yeah and then what happens is then you
can find another hobby that you're
passionate about which could be what I'm
talking about like starting to talk
about this sort of stuff more regularly
and yeah once I make that my passion
then maybe that could become my job so
it's definitely because that's like how
in the past year or so obedience stuff
was like a fun thing but I wasn't
passionate about my
oh the same way that I am about mental
health and wellness it's great you know
to make sure here and there and like you
know kind of chat to people it's like
harder than everything but I just feel I
had so much more to offer that when I
did start doing more talks about mental
health and stuff and I start to actually
hear people saying to well it helped
them and it helped change your
perspective on so many things and like I
said I don't have any credibility I
don't have anything decree or anything
like that I just told you from
experience about because you came to
elephants to me yeah and it's because
the whole premise of it is just because
I threw my teenagers didn't have anyone
to talk to so I try to offer this whole
big sister role to all the other people
but if following me and I feel like that
just means so much more to me yeah and I
think that even though I took a lot
about mental health in the whole YouTube
raw that I'm in I have brands and stuff
to tell me I don't want to work with you
because you talk too much but mental
health well I get too dangerous because
you talk about this stuff I make a bit
you're contentious and I mean I know and
I'm like you know I would never want to
work with you anyway because and if you
stick to this watch how quickly that
will change over the next example is
exactly it change the culture and you
make it happen than the beginning
because for me it's way more important
hearing someone tell me that I've helped
them than being you know giving a bit of
money for a deal that goes a it's my
values so that's the thing I'm juggling
with what you're saying before like
you're doing you do what you did and
then you liked it but then you're like
oh I feel like there's something more
that I can do and I think that as as you
both know like I I want to stimulate
thought and create and creativity and
encourage people to think critically and
for themselves and and I realized the
more and more I think about it's like
even if you do have a university degree
like they don't teach you to think for
yourself at university you get taught
how to answer questions in the right way
that no one no one teaches you how to
think for yourself you get taught
here's the knowledge and right x by said
you don't get taught how to use your
brain so I think that I'm passionate
about trying to encourage people to use
their brain and sort of understand
things and other people's perspectives
and all that stuff so I think I'm gonna
just bloody bite the bullet off to this
do it
have to get some YouTube tips from you
and how to start this this crap up yeah
and everyone we might be traveling again
yes I will leave both of these guys info
down below because I do want you to
obviously check them out because they're
awesome people
by this time let's hope that Sam is
actually like uploaded what you need to
tell the boy but when do you want when
is your book coming out um it goes on
pre-order three gimmicks
that's two signed copies and that starts
next week I think yes yes you know what
like what day because I might be placing
this next week okay like the 20th of
where you go what it what's the oh yeah
oh yeah over the next couple of weeks
yeah definitely because that would be if
we also you guys could jump over and
give Bo some support as well because
that would be that let me know what to
me as well because it's so cool actually
you know walk talk it's not absolutely
yeah yeah but I think it's this isn't
this sort of conversation that I would
love to hopefully inspire among your
followers as well is it you can talk
about things that aren't just how many
followers or someone with all this said
yeah yeah you can talk about things that
aren't just trivial you can talk deep
and be open and communicate with people
like this and you know we're all gonna
walk away from this feeling yeah if you
get this feeling in your I don't you you
after you have organizations like this
it everything is feels lighter so
therapeutic talking to people I mean we
are the culmination of this like
biological processes that have caused us
to be a social animal like that's what
we are we okay we are we are social
creatures fundamentally social creatures
and this is what we always used to do
facilitate social interact
and it's just sad that people don't do
this anymore it's connection and we
don't know I do feel social media we are
becoming disconnected and people
forgetting her so like ah the irony of
it no no it's also cool to get into
really deep conversations with people
you wouldn't ordinarily smell like I've
never sat down with you guys and got
this deep before not that we endorse
drinking yeah yeah thank you guys so
much for watching I hope you enjoyed
this and let me know if this is the kind
of style that you'd love to see again in
the future because I'm sure that Sam
will be doing podcasts in the future as
well yes that's actually happening
update you want just you go
ahead this much like a thank you guys
and I'll see you next time
but thanks for tolerating me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
