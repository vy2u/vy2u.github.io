I have a music festival inspired makeup
look for you I had so much fun making
this look today like this is the kind of
stuff I just love doing it's a glitter
heaps of color just come like spam out
there crazy stuff so this is perfect for
stuff like summer music festivals
Coachella maybe not so much in every
taylors but if you want to wear everyday
thing go ahead and if you are a new
visitor to my channel I am Danny I put
up with two new videos every single week
and it winter was me uses that subscribe
button down below it will be incredible
if you can join the family so without
further due let's refer so today we're
using me a morphe 35o palette for the
eyes because it's so colorful and
beautiful starting with this green color
i'm using a sigma firm blender ii 44
brush to put this into my crease
and I'm also going to mimic all the
eyeshadow i use on my top lid on my
bottom lid as well moving on to the max
two to four brush I'm using a blue color
just below the green
I'm not taking the orangey gold shade
from the palette I'm going to apply this
on the middle of my bottom lid and the
middle of my top lid as well
it's time for the first bit of glitter
and all the glitter that I'm using today
is from the gypsy shrine
the lashes today I'm using danny
dirty-ice eyelashes in the wild which
are an absolute favorite of mine for
dramatic look I'm now going back in with
that piece of purple from before just
add a little bit more because I felt
like the color disappeared and I did
start with the touch
salty lip paint but I found that it's
too light so I did end up going with
rosy good it's my favorite time it's
good a time whew so this is all
self-explanatory I'm just using cosmetic
glue and then applying the glitter
I hope you guys enjoy Said's video I had
the best time in the world Craig miss
you recently I've been really inspired
doing more like colorful look so expects
more like this in the future because I
have so much fun building to you it's
amazing so as you guys have an amazing
day
I'll see very soon and thank you for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
