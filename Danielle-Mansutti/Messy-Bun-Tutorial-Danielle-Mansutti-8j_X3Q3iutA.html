today I am showing you how to get a very
simple but effective messy bun tutorial
it is my go-to hairstyle and I love it
it's so much fun the easiest thing in
the world I try really hard not to not
to be neat because otherwise if you are
neat it just looks true I don't know
they're boring so with this kind of
messy one you get all the crazy it's the
back end just yeah so I'm going to be
showing you a work one and a special one
today and yeah I'm gonna be showing you
so from the back and also from like this
side front angle how I get this look I
do not have my Texan at the moment this
is with short thin hair so I'm showing
you you can do it with any hairstyle you
want and I hope that you enjoyed today
guys let's get straight into it so I'm
gonna start with being a messy bun today
the very simple work friendly school
friendly bun which I do all the time I
do not have my extensions in at the
moment so that's why my hairs will be
quite different the first thing I do to
get a messy bun is that I like to just
grab the sides of my hair here first and
pull them up with my fingers and I'm
grabbing the top part of my hair as well
and just keep in mind I'm not keeping it
neat at the top I'm just making sure
that the sides are all evenly push back
and then I'm just gonna grab all the
back here until I have this big clump of
messiness in my hand I'm just going to
do the first part of the hair like this
just putting it straight over the head
and then scooping up the hair so what
I'm doing is I'm styling this I twist my
hand grab the hair I just caught it pull
it over the bun
the hair tie still hanging around here
and just pull it across and let go do
not let go to find out let go sort of in
the middle and you'll find that you have
a little bit of a bun going on but what
I like to do is I'd like to start
pulling at where the fun is actually
sitting and then you can just twist it
around until you get the right size one
and just start sort of messing around
with the front bits like this I start
just getting my fingers through my hair
just sort of messing it around grabbing
some loose strands from my hair how'd a
bit of a play biz rough as you want the
rougher you are the better the results
on the back it's just looking like a
whole hot mess and it's just very
wearable it sits there all day and it is
started comfortable I'm going to show
you from the front side angle now how it
looks when you do it up because I know
from the back that looking look quite
strange so from the front as you can see
it just got the hair sitting in my hands
I pull the hair tie forwards first scoop
up all the hair upside down and then I
just tie it and then I cool yeah so easy
like pulling out from the sides and the
back pulling more hair so that is how to
do it from the front and now I'm going
to be going to the work one and yeah I
hope that you enjoy so I am going to do
the same thing and I'm just going to
grab the strands of my hair like this
and always start from the side and then
work at the top so I pulled the top in
and then I get all this mullet hanging
at the back for this one I will get my
hair brush like this and start brushing
all the hair so that the back of it is
smooth and just brush it straight into
my hair so now that the whole sides of
my head are smooth I just grab all the
hair from the top like this
and then next I'm just going to get the
hair tie pull it over once get the head
tie pull it over twice and then I grab
the ends of the hair which are just
sitting down at the back like this
and just tuck them in to the button I
pull all the sides of the bun until it
has a shape that I desire so for me this
is a very kind of work more formal kind
of fun so from the back I will just show
you that you just want to get all those
loose hairs from before roll it around
the front like this and then once you've
tied the hair around the bun I'm just
gonna grab a bobby pin and I'm going to
grab where the hair is here and then
just tie it into my disa cure the hair
and then now as you can see I have that
effect where it looks almost like the
hair is wrapping around my bun and it
looks like this from the back and this
one is a lot more formal it doesn't have
the loose strands of hair flying around
everywhere and I would have this bun
more for like work or school the other
buttons very casual but I actually
prefer the other button because it's so
much easier to do and so that is how I
do my messy bun and also more of a work
friendly messy bun
I don't know what to call it so I hope
that you enjoyed this very simple video
today I really appreciate your watching
I will see you guys in a another few
days with a new video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
