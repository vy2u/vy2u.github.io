vlogged in the longest time first thing
let's get out the way
I have very Kris Jenner swollen lip
vibes going on right now I've got my
lips chopped up two days ago so ignore
the fact that it looked kind of like a
baboon slash fish I thought I would love
today is Saturday and today I'm going to
hopefully buy a card today and also I
want to give you a bit of an update on
the house and everything because I feel
like it's been a long time so we'll do
some more like moving bits and bobs
today I've got all the Christmas
playlist on today I'm just like I'm
feeling it
I have been loving my favorite fragrance
right now is this Jo Malone dark amber
and ginger Lily this is my favorite kind
of autumnal oh that sounds so wrong to
me I don't know autumnal mmm okay
autumnal fragrance my favorite one okay
it's crazy
so what baby is missing my seat and the
baby hello today the car situations so
I've always wanted to get like a Range
Rover Evoque but I kind of food absolute
fortune so I have been looking at a mini
because for brightening stuff it's a lot
better to get like a smaller car because
of all the parking and everything it's
just so much easier to organize a mini
or something
janek on the couch what are you doing
you know cheekymonkey should be up here
in a second but yes so I was thinking
about getting a mini this year's my mom
and dad both had mini so I figured that
I know how there are and everything and
they're really really fast was it
because it's just great and then i saw
the MINI Countryman like the five-door
it's kind of like higher off the ground
which i love because i don't like
sitting in low cars hence my jeep
wrangler and stuff he's texting me it
was they get a note every word Oh kisses
Oh kisses so many kisses so yeah I'm
feeling like decorating my house a
little bit more festive I mean I've
started I've got some like nice little
Christmassy kind of gold pillows the
band has been sitting on a lot watching
my hand and so the thing with the car is
that I'm looking at a used one because I
can't afford a new one and
the thing is that we'll look so far away
for me like the ones that actually and a
good price range just so far away and
for me to get there without a car it's
like I do that so that's the really
annoying thing I can't really get there
there's one in Brighton I'm seeing today
which is so overpriced it's actually
valued at about 12 grand but they put up
for 16 and a half and I'm like oh my god
I am the worst when it comes like
bartering and like trying to get the
price down my dad's like Danny you've
got to do it like it no but I get scared
I don't know like I kind of walk in
there and be like it's not worth that
much money because I just I don't know
it freaks me out like to do that but I
have to go unlike my tough pants today
be like no that's too much money
so yeah the cars from 1,013 movie things
like five years old or so it's anyhow
109 it's naughty or no it's got a
notification my period up saying Dupree
was coming soon whoo fantastic so I'm
gonna run off and check this car out in
a second then I'm gonna be showing you
around the house on yours happen what
still needs to happen and giving you few
updates faintest chillin I'll give her a
walk in a second through the word you
know the word walk so I have been so
addicted to Call of Duty it is
ridiculous that I've lost you guys I've
gained like a full on addiction to it
and I get like my headset on and
everything it's just terrible but yeah
my place I should like is my life right
now I'm just like loving it if any of
you guys like peaceful let me know and
also I thinking about filming something
for my place city channel like oh god oh
my but I suck so bad it'll just be funny
I knew I just see you guys to see how
about I am it again
I just realized it's not even like the
2011
yes Omar you're like I'm reading you
guys really festive as well like I just
feel like Christmas makes me so happy so
any excuse to celebrate it early I'm
just like Thor or I'm actually going now
I'm actually leaving so wish me luck and
I'll check in with you guys many other
happy news or sad news after this so see
you soon
what was that I have no idea I wasn't
meant to be
cars valued at twelve thousand eight
hundred they won sixteen point five and
I'm like II knew I often fifteen they
said no so no car for me mmm back to
square one ago I just got home to see
this is monkey has gotten into my
wardrobe I decided eating my shoes
please that's a bit gross I was coming
gone for like a half an hour
you brought your cond upstairs he's a
clever yeah she loves this so good for
like distracting dogs beans a superfood
motivated so you put a tree in here and
just like figure out how to get it and
she loves it hey baby
EP good girl oh yeah whereabouts on the
bed where you let me guess warm hatch so
yeah no car it's alright though I've
learnt now in life that every single
time something falls through it's
because life has something better for
you waiting on the other side that's
what I always taught myself just to get
through this stuff basically there's
another car that I fell in love with and
that didn't work and then fell in love
with Scott
it was overpriced it's just a nightmare
absolute nightmare tonight there beans
oh oh so much love thank you for the
love so now I have my Tesco man coming
at some point with my food because I'm
starvin and I've had one of the worst
weeks of this week you know when you
have a week and it's just like
everything that can go wrong does that
has been this week for me there's so
many reasons like I can't even explain
to you but everything has just gone so
terrible I'm at a point now where I just
have to laugh about it and just relax
that's life and
a few lessons this week and it's just
like so what do you think beanie we
gotta go for walk when the rain stops
yeah you never walk you okay yes that
the yes my lips are so bruised under all
this makeup they have never been so
bruised can you say hmm
and then I've got punched in the face by
part so I'm gonna tidy up quickly and
then I'm gonna show you guys around the
house show you what's been done what
still needs doing take this one out for
a little bit of a walk
I'll show you basically first is my room
so I had like these two wardrobes
there's another one in my spare room oh
but they are so small like they're so
narrow they made getting my clothes and
it's just really hard so I've just got
like my jumpers t-shirts and shoes down
there and I've got like my beanies jeans
bags up here but it is honestly tiny so
I got a second kind of coat rack thing
instead with a few shoes underneath - I
don't actually clean this quite properly
yet but I've got my perfumes here so
I've got lots of like Joe Malone and
there's some dip teak then over here
there's other ones you guys saw that my
last meeting vlog I got this really nice
little arrangement from next home my
little Minnie Mouse ears are hiding over
there Charlie's birthday present is
hiding over there so what do you think
minds do you like it do you like it a
lot you like it however a fun fact so in
order to get these wardrobes built I was
like what I obviously can't build up
myself because it's gonna take two
people I hide like a handyman service it
was almost like an uber service we just
like hire a handyman and the guy who
came he's like I've never done this
before and I was like okay and he was
here for six or seven hours and he told
me at the end he's like yeah they're not
really built that well so they're bit
wobbly and I was like okay great
that's really cool so my wardrobes are
falling apart and then also these which
he built are falling apart like this top
bit keeps like coming off the drawers
are like falling apart so it's fantastic
also as we move down into the lounge and
love this this is for
next home as well it's so Christmassy I
love it I've also fall in love with
these is it so no so so nice I don't
know the speakers you get from Amazon
they're so good
I bought two they're very expensive
though but they are head oak yeah I love
these cushions they're so cool they're
from next as well and this couch from
next as you can tell like I love next so
I quite enjoy being in my lounge it's
like super cozy and then oh my god so
the deal with this is that I bought a
dining set I bought dining table and
chairs and then I went to build the
chairs and there's absolutely no nuts
and bolts or anything so I call the
company told them and then a woman's
like oh yeah I have your nuts and bolts
right in front of me here I'll send them
to you in like five days and I was like
why do you do with everything else but
the whole week I just had this weird
little like dining table arrangement in
my house but as you can see a lot of the
style that I'm doing it's just kind of
like pine and why it is kind of what I'm
doing throughout the whole house you're
at that bing-bong
hey means of stuff is just everywhere I
haven't possibly cleaned up my stuff yet
but my Tesco man is coming soon because
I literally have like zilch it's bad and
then this salmon is like off those sad
my fridge look seriously they need food
I can't even tell you the dramas that
I've had with this microwave thing is
that when I first got it right I took
everything out I made sure that the
table would spin everything and then I
wish you could smell her disgusting
burnt this look anyway I put in a bag of
popcorn in here and then all of a sudden
I could like smell smoke and as you can
see right here I don't really know like
what this is here but it just caught on
fire it's all this I don't know if like
someone's gonna tell me that's a piece
of cardboard or something ridiculous but
it feels like really hard but for some
reason every single time I uses
microwave this compartment just sets on
fire which is not ideal so now my
kitchen stinks of smoke every single
time I open this I
make popcorn which makes me really sad I
know flake this is too small or
something because yeah this just is
really annoying and just sets a light
every single time oh my god it stinks so
bad this is gonna get another microwave
as well so don't set my whole house on
fire but I did learn by that happening
this whole kitchen being like smoky and
stinky my mom's don't work to know that
I don't have any sweat myself
there's actually nothing about I love
all the cozy days though like cozy
weekends forgot my game I've got my
puppy I've got my tea I've got my
biscuits how could I not be happy so we
doing this for the next like 30 hours
most likely and pinups probably see you
guys on the Tesco Matt's here and we
finally have food to cook yes for having
food in the house okay my tester guy was
just here I'm gonna show you my little
grocery haul I'm not gonna keep anything
out I do eat lots of junk so I'm not
gonna pretend like I don't firstly I've
got a whole bunch of water because the
water in Brighton isn't right drinkable
what I got today of course I had to get
some almond milk then we have some
chocolate we have some mandarins or they
call my clementines here or something so
like cherry barrels potatoes these my
favourite to bake these are the best
things ever if you're conscious about
calories or whatever they're so low and
they're so yummy and they're just
awesome the basically just frozen orange
juice
so cute number tomatoes this is probably
my salmon I assume because I literally
yeah well one hand I literally live off
a diet of salmon veggies and potatoes
like my favorite thing or tuna and chips
my other favorite so I've got some
minstrels as well some veggies and
grapes this is some pate for baines's
Kong some wine of course some Blanc some
Cecchini bits jabber cakes popcorn which
is kind of pointless because I can't
even put it in the microwave and other
chips you would have seen even more
dramas I hope to have a Tesco delivery
for a week because firstly my card got
blocked and they sent the wrong address
old kind of stuff so I haven't have any
food for like a week in here I've been
living off crisps and chocolate and all
a good stuff so I'm gonna cook some
salmon and potatoes and veggies so
excited to eat a meal even though this
one is very casual very homely probably
very boring and I seem like I'm talking
very fast just because I'm so excited to
talk to you guys again like I just love
vlogging this feels really nice to talk
to you and everything so I'm gonna let
her eat because she's going insane right
now you wanna come inside say me so I'm
gonna go put away my shopping but thank
you so much for watching it this is a
like cozy vlog I hope you enjoyed it
I'll see you over very crazy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
