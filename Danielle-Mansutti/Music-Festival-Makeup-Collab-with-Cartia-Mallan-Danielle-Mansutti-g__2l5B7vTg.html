I have done a festival instant best tool
inspired makeup tutorial this is a
collaboration with the beautiful Carton
while I'm on YouTube another Australian
beauty group she is absolutely amazing
and gorgeous check out her channel I'll
leave some of her clips here zone with
you guys we thought it would be the
perfect collaboration for us because we
both love festival style my style is
more like a Coachella boho style I don't
know I really hope you guys enjoyed that
something really different and I'm going
to get straight into it so I'm just
using the milk chocolate shade from the
chocolate bar palette in my crease just
to create a little bit of definition and
I'm just blending this throughout my
crease
I'm now using this gorgeous shade called
creme brulee on my lids it's a very
golden shimmery shade I'm just packing
that all on my lid
now using the shade cherry cordial I'm
using this in my out of B just to create
a little bit of depth within the eye I
feel like these colors work really well
together and I'm just using a big fluffy
brush to blend it all together
so now moving on to face I'm using a
mixture of mac and cheese Foundation and
I'm just applying this with my little
real techniques sponge
I'm using the Australis AC on tour
contouring and highlighting kit as
always just to give my face a bit of
structure and just define my cheekbones
a bit more
using the maybelline instant age rewind
I'm just applying this to the bridge of
my nose and underneath my eyes and
blending this out
and this is in the banana shade to set
my concealer now I got paid from a $2
shop so seriously get it from anywhere
you want and these brushes but also for
material shop and I'm just deciding to
just sort of go with the flow I would
have no plan about the structure of the
face paint but I thought this one would
look pretty cool so I'm just starting
with a white outline and then applying
some black Letarte in the middle
so thank you so much for watching today
I really appreciate it and as always
check out Katia sphere as well and let
us know what you think and I'll be
seeing you guys really really soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
