Oh
hey everyone welcome back to my channel
in today's video I coded a pink festival
a makeup tutorial for you guys it's
going into your festival season here in
Australia I'm so excited
the next festival that I think I'm going
to is beyond the valley Evan years and
I'm so excited it's like funny I'm like
practicing my makeup ready and it's
September don't you like to see how I
did this ot to make up crazy glitter
look then please keep watching we are
using this gorgeous palette today by
Urban Decay which is their electric
palette and starting with a pink shade
which is called savage
I'm going to really massively actually
apply this over my crease and my lower
lash line and just continuously blend
blend blend that member blend it out as
much as I possibly can it's fine to be
messy with this it's not much look
perfect it's a bit of fun it's really
colourful it's really vibrant so it's
okay to be messy then I'm adding slow
burn to the outer part of my eye this is
just to darken and deep and everything
and then I'm going to ensure that I am
blending and blending and doing a little
bit more blending to make sure that the
colors are working together and you
can't see where warm color starts and
the other one ends then I'm just
continuously trying to blend it through
different brushes and all that stuff and
then pack more on you know the drill
see if I didn't cut this down it'd be a
long process and I'm just going to use
my fluffy brush to make sure that
everything is blended
using many anyways a makeup geek palette
and weaves in a really deep dark red
shade I'm just applying this over
slow-burn to ensure it's even darker and
even deeper because just creates a
really really really nice effect and
then from here on out it is more
blending so just keep blending until you
can't see a one color start and one
finishes
now I'm adding some glitter glue to get
ready for this real cheap glitter that I
found which is really cool just be
really careful and don't do what I did
and pretty much get it in your tear duct
area I had to like fix that bit of a
mistake but it looks so cool putting on
your tear duct area and I'm going to add
some of the Attar deist eyeliner to my
lower lash line and also my waterline
just to darken it up even more then I'm
applying a few coats of the Too Faced
better than sex mascara to ensure
they're going to be ready for the lashes
a little bit later on but before we jump
over to lashes I actually want to darken
up the eye a little bit so I felt like
it just looked too pink so I went back
in with that dark red shade and I just
continued to blend blend blend blend
blend until it was a little bit darker
and a little bit deeper
now using I spy lashes in Luna I'm
applying these onto my lashes they are
the perfect shoes for festivals like
they're just so pretty then we have this
red fine glitter so I began by dabbing
this all over my cheekbones and then up
to my temples before adding more of the
glitter glue and adding more of the
chunks on top and you'll see exactly
what I did honestly he just be as messy
as you want it's a fun thing about this
it doesn't have to be neat the Messier
and the less you care about it the
better it's going to look so just go OTT
like I did and become a massive glitter
unicorn because it's the only time that
we can really do it and get away with it
so why not just go hand with the glue
and this is the finished look we made to
the end what I really hope that you guys
enjoyed this makeup look I'll see you
all very soon I love you all so much bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
