in today's video I am making my bathroom
I'm going to show you how I get my hair
and makeup like this in five minutes and
I will start with the hair portion
because I'm not sure one day for hair
believe it or not but the products that
I'm using right now to make it this
beautiful amazing so I'll get into the
hair portion then we'll do the makeup
but I hope you enjoy it very quick and
easy everyday makeup stroll and let's
get into it so first things first I
think I kinda need to do something about
my hair really every single morning I
wake up and it's like this and it's just
like can I just say that dry shampoo is
probably the best thing that's ever
happened in the hair universe and I am
is so obsessed with dry shampoo these
days just like refreshes my hair in
between washes with know like rinsing or
water required some like lazy girl like
that's heaps of volume to my hair as
well and today's video is sponsored by
the teens which I'm so excited about
because I use the products every single
week without falling every single way
I've got my moment and it did to the
taste as well like she's just mmm and
they had like this new stylist range so
what you want to show again so I'm going
to go ahead and actually show you a
bunch of their products because they
have such a massive range these days and
is so good
I love the state ones you know the
normal dry shampoos these are just an
absolute classic I love the rose gold
one absolutely obsessed I will be using
this one today please just smell good I
want to say next time you go to
Priceline just sniff them they're
amazing
a lot people don't realize that these
actually do Styles things as well and
when I discovered that they did this was
so happy
we have a great timer and a texturizing
spray we also have a hate and shine
sprite as well as an xxx volume spray
which is my life I use this all the time
I'm onto it at least this is for tastes
hairspray and come just quickly in my
package
oh I love the fact that that packaging
is all just so colorful and so great and
so fine so I'm going to show you how I
put dry shampoo on my hair and I avoid
that white residue I'll show you the
hack to Boyd that we just so you notice
all the rose gold and the sweetie one
our limited edition and the cherry and
the top of the one like your staples
which which you find anywhere I'm pretty
sure firstly I'm just gonna brush my
hair and I love using dry shampoos like
when I'm gonna brush when I literally
colleague all the tools where and what I
love is that because I'm washing my hair
less these days because I'm using more
dry shampoo I'm not stripping the oils
from my hair as much as I used to the
absolute perfect if you already like the
works cool running to the gym you need
this in your life trust me so what you
want to do to avoid that like white
drink which is just just so lovely you
want to make sure that the dry shampoo
is 30 centimeters away from your scalp
because if you do it like this you'll
get like that white streak so I like to
do I'll try to make sure I'm all the
frame is I just I'm like massaging it
into my scalp and I'm just gonna ensure
that there's no why this you don't want
to stop there
no you want to actually part your hair
to the side like this because you'll
have greasy spots and I'm hot more
places and just your parting and I'm
actually gonna use the tropical one for
this because I actually like to use like
two different sets of my heart once
because everyone's like whoa it smells
amazing and I'm like I know I know I'm
just leave the tropical one now which is
one of the staples and again I'm just
gonna make sure that they centimeters
away smells so good massage it into my
hair as well because you just want to
make sure that you don't have any greasy
bits especially if you're gonna be tying
it up it's so good for styling your hair
as well it just adds like grip to hair I
feel and I wear weak sometimes as you
guys know
I put dry shampoo all over my wigs
because it just makes them so much
easier to style so I will just continue
using the tropical one and I'm gonna
cover my face just make sure won't get
in my eyes cause such you wouldn't be
ideal on my scalp now this is day 3 or 4
head don't let it be an absolute grease
bag by now but you can see how like soft
and fresh my hair is looking after the
dry shampoo you're going to use one of
their stylist products I'm gonna use
their hairspray what I like to do I just
add a bit of volume and everything like
that but I actually Bend for it and I'll
spray the back of my hair as I bent
forward because I just find that you
just get a little volume that way you'll
see what I mean and then I'll just rub
that in again I'll just use that
underneath nothing that I love about
that hairspray as well it's not greasy
and it's lightweight I hate when you put
on a hair spray on your hair just feels
like like thick and gross it doesn't
make me feel like that at all I'll leave
all that info in the description if you
want to learn any more but now I really
need to fix my face I've been looking at
things that I make up with too long am i
oh my god I need to put something on
here a headband is on and ready to go
we're talking business yeah I'm gonna
use the color pop no filter concealer
this honestly is the best concealer for
my natural skin this one is in the light
neutral 15 as well and I just find for
me it's just the perfect color because I
am actually quite pale II maybe notice
that I've got a fake telling my face you
may have noticed I mean I kind of do it
like an oompa loompa and then I also
drag it on my tablet and like a little
bit my nose because that's the main
spots for me that I'd like to conceal
because I have quite veiny under eyes so
I like to just do this in my forehead I
normally just like leave so I put the
concealer on and then we need to set it
with a powder we'll be using the Too
Faced Born This Way it's upside down
this is the powder that I love to use to
set my under eyes but these days it's
just so natural
incredible do that I think that's the
right thing to do
so put like this much powder on I'll
grab my Buddha blender and you might
notice that my eyebrows are a little bit
darker that's because I got my eyebrows
re micro bladed so luckily I wanted to
put on too much product on there because
they're fresh and dark which is perfect
I like to just set this in all the
places that I put the concealer as I'm
filming this I'm actually leaving
Australia in two days great not five
games my accent back a little bit since
being here and everyone saying my accent
doesn't English one of in England
because I'm like a chameleon but yeah
I'm definitely exciting a bit more
Australian now yeah I'm just in my old
bathroom this is the house I grew up in
and fun fact I'm nervous I'm that
flexible but you didn't know did you did
that I am running out shopping straight
off this which is why I'm doing this
quick makeup look that I just thought
you'd like to know that wearing my
pajamas good

neighbours playing the strike zone
anyway back to the makeup I'm using the
make out max this is a sunlit skin and
bronzer oh yeah that's you guys watching
me on a little tripod on the window

I'm just gonna add a little bit of
warmth to my cheekbones I'm gonna keep
it super light because it and not too
foggy my skin too much but have a really
like makeup on just like a little bit of
a sun kissed blue nothing too harsh

reading is the benefit in gimme brow I
really shouldn't be using this actually
about three days until I should put any
product on my eyebrows and
rebel alright so this is in the number
five shayana
whatever five and I like to just add
this to the outer part of my brows I
made my tail just darken it up a little
bit because that's where I'm missing a
bit of warm won't countenance
