channel in today's video we're talking
all things beauty prep whether it's for
like a big event travel anything big
small in between mmm
you know the drill anything which I
basically have to make an effort for I'm
traveling the next two weeks on brand
trips I'm actually in New York for band
trip I get home for two days and then I
go on another brand trip in LA so I can
imagine going through American customs
when I've been back to England for two
days they're gonna be a bit like what
they're gonna be a little bit suspicious
about why I came home for two days and
I'm back in the States again but that is
something to worry about when it happens
so anyway let's go back to the topic of
the video which is beauty preparation so
I haven't actually seen I don't think
I've seen a video like this before
mmm probably is because it's a beauty
community dance videos but everything
this video is about applying foundation
with a condom for God's sake mom in
terms of like taking you guys along mean
of August ah we're gonna go to the PD
songs together get on nail song head
turn I'm gonna get naked and give you my
turn with you guys we're gonna do
everything an outfit shopping which will
be fun so if you wanna see how I prepare
myself to look presentable and primed
and polish the for big event I'm not
just like lazy in my hoodies and truck
ease with no nails done and eye makeup
done like I am normally good morning
guys I met to go get these done because
they're looking kinda Sur like they
always do I hate having my nails done
simply because it's so impractical and
annoying and I'm an anxious person who
bites their nails scratches they're no
scratches their skin picks up their
nails so they don't know me last that
long so today I'm gonna get acrylic
nails because they kind of last a bit
longer for me cuz they're a bit tougher
when I get gel nails unfortunately yeah
I just kind of picked them up really
quick and I always get so scared that
the nail lady's gonna judge me because I
have so much like broken skin around my
fingers yeh being anxious so what I'm
going to do now is hop on Pinterest and
Phi
some inspiration of nails that I want to
get you know I'm thinking about getting
something practical but pretty practical
work pretty I like that so short but
nice but I can still take out my
contacts that stubborn myself in the eye
kind of learned that would be ideal so
let's go on Pinterest net to find some
inspiration I'm thinking like this sort
of shape like almond shape but just not
long I swear this photo is so boring but
I guess it kind of explains the shape
that I want but I love this like rose
gold copper glitter or this go hazel
nice good stuff and this is gonna look
so much better when my nails done I
shouldn't really be holding this with
the ugly nails that I let spritz this
and then Lego here's my before wait how
do we do it how do the girls on
Instagram do it like this and then he is
my after and I have a funny story for
you guys and also when I do this why
does my little finger tuck under what
doesn't I can't actually normally oh
there we go
that looks more Instagram doesn't it oh
my lord
something happened today at the nail
salon which I have so you guys about cuz
it was so weird
never nails are done I can do all this
again yeah I was really weird okay so I
don't get my nails done right and I
wanted to get acrylics and I normally go
to the lanes health and beauty to get my
nails done but they just do the gel
pores job wash and stuff I think I don't
think they do acrylic so I just thought
I'd go to like a random one which was
local to me though I went there a walk
there because it's really close but when
I sat down was chatting to the lady it's
doing my nails and she's tell me about
how they're from Vietnam and we're
talking about Australia and all this
kind of stuff
and she's asked me obviously a lot of
questions because of my accent and like
where I'm from why you in England it so
miserable in England like why would you
not logg I've heard this so many times
everyone's like why would you move to
England the weather is miserable when
I'm like it doesn't
it's my home there chattin she asked me
what I do every time that I'm somewhere
like in a cab or now alone or getting my
hair done or something and someone asked
me what I do for a living I normally
just lie or make something up because I
don't really like getting into the whole
YouTube conversation it's just
especially favorite older and they won't
understand it's just something which I
just can't be bothered getting into
because I'm always met with how much
money do you make question and there's a
lot of kind of bothered so I just say
I'm in marketing or I'm still I say I'm
a student whatever so she said to me
what do you do and I said I'm in
marketing for social media or something
I courage with what I said and then she
was talking about my accent she said to
me so it keep in mind you guys saw me
when I went there I was like make up
list not quite like this how did it go
how does she start so which heading and
she goes oh I've got a client I have a
client who rents her house out to this
23 year old social media person you
won't believe it it's a three through a
bedroom house and she lives up by
herself with her dog I'm sitting down
I'm like well there can't be many other
people here we go she doesn't know who I
am and she's talking about me see my
face so I was like I'm just gonna go
along with it then I was like really Wow
then the next bit I'm a little bit
uncomfortable about I was a bit at war
mmm so she said yes and you won't
believe how much rent she's paying a
month she's paying pounds a month I'm
thinking my oh my god how do you know
this information but she did get it
wrong she did actually say I was paying
more than what I am so like okay she's
been told everything about my life and
she knew so many things about me
I thought this is not okay and I said to
be like oh that's really cool does this
girl live in Brighton and she goes no
I'm gonna she lives on digital road and
she said my Road no like Oh
I could be any random person and she's
just said how much rent I paid a month
where I live and all this other
information about me and I'm just like
oh my lord you shouldn't be just saying
this to random people I was like oh so
who told you this that you just said all
the person who rents the house to her no
it's either this state agent or my
landlord I don't know but I was too far
into my life being a marketing person
that I didn't want to be like by the way
you're talking about me I just can't
believe how much money she has can you
believe that people make that kind of
money from something so silly and I'm
like yeah I know it's crazy it's crazy
and they should just go something about
how eikichi byzant a real job and all
this kind of stuff and I was like oh
yeah really whoo yeah it was so weird
good morning is the next day my nails
are still on her head I am heading into
London now I have some meetings to do
and then when I'm there I'm going to go
outfit shopping I'm feeling like maybe
Zara Topshop get some outfits which I'm
gonna wear in New York City hopefully
and I get told off my camera in the
shops but when you try to walk in public
casually I'm in Oxford Street
and my meetings done further is a
fantastic sound for the background of my
blow

picked up so much stuff but they have to
leave for half of it I have like 12
hours here but I'm excited to try mom I
