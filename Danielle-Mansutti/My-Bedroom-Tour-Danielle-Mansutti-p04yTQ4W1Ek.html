today I'm doing one of the most
requested videos of all time which is my
friend Tom hope you guys have requested
for me to make this video forever
pretty much since I started my first few
videos I'm YouTube because I always
filming my room and I was always in and
out and you guys wanted to see what was
in my room I'm gonna be completely
honest with you guys and let you know
that I have been a little bit worried to
film this just because my room is quite
boring it's really nothing special seen
a lot of girls on YouTube and their
rooms look like something from a
magazine you're just like whoa let's
just get straight into it so when you
walk into my room this is like the 360
degree angle of what you see so I'm
standing where my door is now and this
is just where everything is placed so I
think I'm just gonna start with one of
the first things that you see in my room
which are these shelves here which I got
from office works
on the very very very top row I don't
have too much I just keep up their extra
nail polish's I have my Bondi sands tans
which I'm using and I also have a lush
bath bomb the next section is my face
section so I just keep a range of things
in here I've just got some primers here
and then I have some drugstore
foundations I've got some BB creams and
then I keep my foundations here they're
all drug through obviously except for my
Estee Lauder one and my Studio Fix and I
also keep my tans behind it so I've got
my Bondi stands I've got Lovington I've
got chi chi's ten and then I have some
other turns some extra stuff at the back
the next section down is my eye section
this is where I like to keep my
eyeshadow palettes that's where I keep
my Islanders in here and I have my big
morph or morphe brushes brushes
eyeshadows in the back I like to keep
them set up in these little metal holder
things I bought these from office works
they cost me like two dollars or so and
the eyeliners are in a lipstick holder
from Kmart which is about five dollars
so the fourth Throwdown is where I like
to keep some lip products so I've just
got my very matte lipsticks at the front
the struggle is real I dare only own
three MAC lipsticks don't judge and I
have a sari and I have a lime crime
lipstick as well and then behind that I
have my chichi lipsticks in here as well
as the chichi lip glosses next to it and
these are both from Kmart as well and
the fifth drawer down just contains
storage I have a lot of filming
equipment cables and all that stuff in
this box and then I have jewelry for
videos in this box I have some extra
makeup just sitting in the middle there
and then behind that I have just stuff
for my eyes I've got sunglasses my daily
contact lens is my eye drops and all
that exciting stuff and then finally at
the very bottom I just have this
gorgeous mess which I keep some bags and
clutches and stuff like that in just so
I can grab them before I leave the house
so now I'm moving on to the next thing
you see when you come in my room
it is my mirror Hey and then I also have
my drawers sitting over here
when I'm getting dressed in the morning
I just come over to this section here
and if I have any makeup left on my face
I just get off with the guy at water
this is my favorite perfume in the whole
world which is bonbon by Viktor and Rolf
then I have some tea tea perfume sitting
at the back also some dry shampoo
sitting there as well I bought this
skull plant thing at Kmart and then over
on this straw I just have some things
that I just like to put on there when I
cut in my room I've just got my contiki
just sort of a catalog that I'm looking
at because I'm going on holiday soon
with the contiki the book that I'm
reading at the moment and then I have a
cute little card from Michael when I was
really sick so I like to keep that day
because it's really really really cute
and then over here I just have some
candles and a plant I just like to have
a little bit of greenery in my room just
to liven it up a little bit and just
make it a bit prettier so these candles
I got for my brother for Christmas and I
think they're gorgeous colors I
absolutely love them to bits
and now over here's where I spend a lot
of my time which is my desk my desk is
from ikea i believe but a few things on
my desk which i'll show you from this
point of view it's just I have over here
all my stuff for when I wake up like my
contact lenses my contact solution and a
few candles and my remotes but obviously
I have my makya then I have my makeup
brushes sitting over here and makeup
storage here so this is just what is
closest to my bed when I wake up which
is just my contact lens stuff and I have
an eye mask sitting here for when I'm
asleep and then I have my TV and air
conditioner remotes here then sitting
behind my brushes I have a little photo
of Michael knife from when we're on
holiday in party this is two years ago
already which is crazy then I have a
little souvenir ghost adult from Japan
and the moisturizer which I'm using in
the mornings then next to that I have my
little makeup storage box here it's just
where I've been organizing my makeup and
jewelry and stuff but I use my stays off
for tutorials just so it's easy to read
so I haven't done a makeup collection
video because I'm really embarrassed
because I don't really have that much
makeup but I'll just show you what I
keep in each section so I keep lip
glosses and some extra lipsticks in the
first drawer in the second drawer is a
whole bunch of mascaras next section is
where I keep my eyes chorus eyeliners
because I use these the most and then I
also have the balm how about those how
about them apples whose section is just
palettes and I stuff they use everyday
almost a so I have my steal it and a
light palette my Too Faced chocolate bar
palette sitting there and then my AC on
tour palette at the back and then the
very bottom drawer just has some things
like the thank-you cards that I write
back to you guys that send letters to my
PA books and just to makeup wipes and
all that kind of good stuff like my
bedspread is from tarjay my mum bought
this bedspread for me ages ago
and I love it it's like a silky
bedspread and it feels so nice and then
just above my bed is my little section
where I keep some letters from you guys
where I read every morning and then over
here I have my bookshelf my TV and then
these are my wardrobes and this
wallpaper is from Laura Ashley I have
had a lot of you guys ask where it's
from we bought it from Laura actually a
long time ago but I'm not too sure if
they still stock it
so just jumping onto my bed now to show
you guys this is my favorite section of
the whole room because it's what I wake
up and look at every day it's my letters
from you guys and also just some photos
and stuff like that I did actually have
to remove a lot of letters that were
sitting around here because you guys
said you didn't want them being shown in
videos or they're really personal so I
thought that I might take them down
because people can easily pause this and
read letters and stuff like that so
normally have a few more letters than
this but these are just the ones that I
know people don't mind being shown on
camera
now over here is my bookshelf this is
where I keep the books that I've read
and stuff like that but please keep in
mind a lot of these books are from when
I was younger so I just keep them all up
here so obviously I've got some what
really kids books up here as well but
these are just all the ones that I've
bought and yeah I just like to keep them
up here and the Shelf which they're
sitting on is also from Ikea so now that
I've stepped all over my bed Oh a huge
mess but anyway I just wanted to show
you that what look at what it looks like
from this height and that is my air
conditioner up there in case and I was
wondering what that last thing it's sort
of thing that Coco's laying on right now
is just a blanket I believe it's from
bed and bath and yet so it's a very
snuggly blanket and as you can see she
loves it to bits
so now that I've trampled all of my bed
it's like Oh rumbling her eyes but
anyway I think that's all I have to show
you guys from the outside of my room I
really hope that you enjoyed it
but really right that you enjoyed my
room tool its value let me know indeed
and I'll be seeing you guys really</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
