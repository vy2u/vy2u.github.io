today's video we are doing a Q&amp;amp;A I
actually guys to send me some questions
on Twitter and without further ado let's
jump into it the first question is from
Zoe's bang she asks how old were you
when you got your first period oh my
goodness I was 9 I was 9 I was in year 5
I was in primary school and I went to
toilet and thought that I was dying I
did not understand what was going on I
ended up telling my head teacher at
school and I was like what's happening
to me I mean there's staff toilets and
gave me everything to sort myself out
with and it was very young I hit puberty
really early I started you know going
through puberty changes by like 7 8
years old so yeah by 9 I could have had
children and that is messed oh why are
you guys early bloomers as well because
I honestly was just like I'm dying like
I'm going to bleed to death what do you
look for in a future partner what is the
first thing you notice about them the
first thing that I noticed about guys
without a doubt is their eyes and their
smile the biggest thing for me is like a
nice smile nice eyes like oh yeah first
impressions açaí and when it comes to
their personality for me the biggest
thing is that they actually listen
always such a nice feeling when they
will bring up something that you said
like so long ago it makes you realize
okay you do actually listen to me well I
know that might sound like really low
standards but you know what I mean just
someone who's thoughtful caring
considerate and not selfish or arrogant
or like Oh cocky no thank you guys her
down at Earth observant caring loyal I
love you Tammy says have you ever
thought about getting any surgery and
then brackets should put boobs done lips
etc throughout my life I've had lots of
phase where I'm like I want to have big
boobs or I have this surgery that's
surgery
this done to my face better than my face
whatever have I ever done it no I don't
know I think it's just the society that
we grew up in if you do want to do
anything to your body totally your call
no one else has any other set in it than
you do so remember that if you want to
get something done get it done if you
don't wanna get it done awesome okay
that's my sort of attitude towards it I
mean I've always wanted to get my lips
on but I'm very scared to get my lips
done because I'm very nervous that they
might look really bad I was younger I
had an overbite my lips actually
naturally sort of protrude out with a
little bit so I feel like if I got my
lips done
I might actually look like you know
Daffy Duck when I was younger I want to
get my boobs done but now I'm like no
thank you
I've never had like a needle in my face
and you know I've never had Botox or all
the projections or whatever I've had
composite bonding on my teeth to make my
teeth slightly different shape I've had
my eyebrows tattooed on and I get my
lashes lifted I guess that's the most
like cosmetic procedures that I've ever
had now I've never had surgery but at
the end of day if you wanna get surgery
for yourself your own reasons and not
because someone else is making you feel
insecure but because it's for yourself
and no one else then no one else should
have a right say anything about what you
want to do to your body it's your body
not theirs
end of story okay Oh Mary I love you
will you vlog your LA trip if you are
not to follow me on instagram you may be
unaware that I'm going to LA on Tuesday
and I'm so excited I'm going by myself
a little bit of solo traveling I'm
totally fine with traveling by myself I
love it I throw everything it's like
awesome any of you guys from LA please
let me know in the comments and please
let me know any way you would recommend
me to go or do or we can hang out
somewhere it's all good I actually have
a few little videos up my sleeve that
I'm planning out to film in LA and I
hope you guys are going to really like
them I want to do a bit more filmmaking
stuff I want to do a bit more sort of
lifestyle dive even go a little bit
fitness you guys know I'm not a makeup
artist I'm not qualified I didn't make
it for funds that makeup isn't me like
my whole youtube channel is not just
makeup there's a lot more to people
makeup
so I sort of want to like push that out
a little bit more bit more like
lifestyle stuff and when I'm back I want
to do more routines like really fun
videos like that so I don't know key
thing that would be a good idea because
I love to do that Chett like Mel says do
you have a crush on anyone right now
yes aah Carly say anything else I'm
trying to be really private this time so
yeah next question is advice on small
boob acceptance honestly this took me
quite a few years to accept myself I am
small boobs as we can see right here
just like embrace it now I feel I feel
really happy with having small bags I
kind of feel like they're coming in a
little bit like if it were trans small
big girls like myself the whole lace bra
let's check another most bralette trend
makes us feel really confident because
like hey this looks like really cool
those small boobs and everything so
small we have acceptance honestly and
the day guys boobs are made for one
thing and one thing only and that is
feeding your child us as a society we
are so screwed up we just sexualized
everything you know if there's boobs
like whatever it doesn't matter if
they're flopping your bouncy or big or
small whatever like their boobs they're
designed to be your child
you know Gabriela says are you going to
be releasing any more beauty products if
you guys have been following me on
social media and my previous videos you
see that I recently released my ice by
eyelash range
I've been absolutely stressed a lot
these past few days I've been packing
all your orders myself doing like all
that kind stuff myself because I want to
be as hands-on as I can with the
business it means a lot to me that you
guys are placing orders and supporting
me so I want to give back meaning
putting my hard work and make sure you
all get the best quality ones and the
Osun out for me and everything's but
other products I have a lot of things
going on in my head about things that I
would love to make but in terms of the
mystic miss me making them mmm it's hard
with the eyelashes it was a struggle
because I did it all on my own I did all
like find the supplier I'm designing
them and designing all the stuff the
designs for the website whatever I did
it all myself I do want to make a lot of
other stuff but I can't do it by myself
anymore I'm going to need to reach out
someone to help me we'll see how that
goes but I do have a lot of ideas of
things that I want to bring out and I'd
love to bring out but I do need more
help to do that and make it possible but
we'll see how that goes so concludes the
Q&amp;amp;A for today I hope you guys enjoyed it
and are having a brilliant week I'll see
you all very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
