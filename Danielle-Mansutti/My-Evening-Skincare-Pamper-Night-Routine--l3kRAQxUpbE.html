everyone welcome back to my channel and
welcome to my bedroom today we're having
a bit more like a relaxing chilled video
so I thought it would be great to just
film it in my chill space on at my
comfortable bed today I'm going to share
with you my pamper routine I know a lot
of us have those days where we're really
tired
we've just had a rubbish day we're just
feeling so like tense and we're so
stressed and we're so like our best
thing you can do is pamper yourself at
night have a little spa at-home day this
is perfect for just any day you want to
just make yourself feel really beautiful
and really fresh it's also incredibly
perfect for when it's that time of the
month to just feel so much better I have
to perform yourself so if you'd like to
see what I do on the days I'm a bit sad
a bit tired never pick me up in a bit of
a relaxing time then please keep
watching this is such a cliche I know
it's subject Lee Shay and it looks like
such a beautiful thing to say but
honestly I really genuinely find that
lighting candles helps me relax the
smell of lit candles like really nice
the candles they just call me and it
just made me feel a lot more relaxed
after of course I will run a bath
seriously the best thing for the spa day
a little relaxing pamper night is having
a bar if you have a shower I'm really
sorry this is going to be revolved
around bath most of the video so once
I've started to run the bath I always
put a bit of bubble bath and now that
moon
one from write-offs after I do that I
just choose a lush bath bomb another
cliche but it's so true it just makes me
feel happy it's colorful it's fun so I
love it and it doesn't hurt that they
look so cool when they do the little
explosion as well
the next thing I'd like to do to just
chill out on one relax it's just to get
some nice music going so I like to go on
Spotify and just choose a few songs that
I know are gonna help you relax and just
chill out so nothing like crazy death
metal scream I gotta stuff or anything
just nice relaxing kind of music once
I've got my music ready I just put that
on the side of where my bathtub is
because I don't like using it in the
bath because I'm so scared of dropping
my phone in the bath I then go to mirror
and I starts do a bit of my skincare
routine so what I like to do first is
use my guardian my Stella water this has
been my hollow girl for so long now
and I guess it's with a cotton pad and I
use this all in my face to remove all
the grime and the makeup everything it
helps my skin feels so clean and fresh
personally I like to make my past really
hot to the point I'm really boiling in
the bath once I get in the bath I really
like to just soak my skin for a few
minutes and then get a body scrub or a
hand exfoliating mitt and just start to
exfoliate my skin on all my bodies -
every single inch of my body i exfoliate
because it helps so much for helping you
feel fresh it is really nice feeling to
exfoliate and I definitely recommend it
if you don't already this is also a time
that I will shave my legs not really the
most relaxing thing but it is a panther
night we are just trying to make
ourselves nice and clean and fresh and
then I will just apply a body wash the
one that I'm using is just a random one
that my mom uses so here you go this is
what I'm currently using in the bath
then everything is nice and then and
relaxed and I can just sit in the bath
and just not even think about anything
try really hard not to fall asleep
because it's very dangerous I will just
sit there for a long time and just relax
so at this point you can do whatever
helps you to relax I know people like to
read in the bath personally I'm just
scared of dropping my book in the bath
so I don't do that I just sit and listen
to music some people really enjoy
playing apps and stuff like that in the
bath as well but I'm just going to drop
in my point of the bath as well once I
get out of the bath I tend to just sit
in my towel for a long time and then I
will apply my moisturizer at the moment
I'm just using a body butter by so I can
glory I really love it and makes my skin
really soft and soon the next thing that
I do is put on my pajamas this is a
crucial thing of pep night you have to
be wearing your pajamas as soon as I get
into pajamas I don't know what it is but
I instantly less stressed out way more
relaxed way more comfortable and happy
so get some pajamas that are really cozy
and comfortable and just jump straight
into them after the bar at this point it
depends on how my skin is looking
if it needs a little bit of TLC then I
will grab my glam glow mask i used the
super mud the white one in the name but
i'll do a product show for you guys i
swear by this glam boy stuff i use it
for the first time when I was at
Shannon's house and ever since then I've
just swarmed by it she told me it was
amazing and I tried it and it was
amazing I find that if I do have
breakouts or anything
I'll leave my glam glow mascot over them
for a long time it just honestly feels
like sucks out the dirt and stuff it's
just hot I can't recommend it enough
while I'm waiting for my mask to work
this is around the time that I will grab
my nail polish and start to paint my
nails I feel like painting your nails is
just a really fun thing to do as well
after I remove my glam glow mask I also
apply moisturizer on to my face and onto
my neck as well
and now that I'm completely fresh and
clean how many times have I said those
two words I feel like I've said them so
many tire impression clean of course I'm
going to jump into bed at this point I'm
not completely ready for bed I'm just
nice and relaxed and I feel like the
best thing to do when I'm in a relaxed
mindset is to read there right now my
favorite author is Jojo Moyes if you
haven't read me before you by Jojo Moyes
have to read it it's all good right out
I'm reading the 1+1 by joining Moyes and
I'm really enjoying it I just love
reading and I'll read for all of an hour
so perhaps depending on how busy my
night is the best thing to do after that
is to turn out your lights put on your
little eye mask and get some beauty
sleep
and that is my pamper routine and a
little bit of like my skincare routine
as well I really hope you guys enjoyed
it and please let me know if your paper
routine is very similar I appreciate you
guys watching so much and I can't work
see you soon
