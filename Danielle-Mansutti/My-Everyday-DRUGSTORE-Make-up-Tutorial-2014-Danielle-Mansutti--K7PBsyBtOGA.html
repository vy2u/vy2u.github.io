makeup routine I'll be listing the
products and prices just so you get some
idea of doing an everyday makeup routine
on a very low budget so I tried not to
talk too much in this video just to keep
it short and sweet so if there's
anything that you want to know that
please leave a comment and I'll get back
to you so enjoy fine so now it's time to
put on the lovely headband and get
started alright so firstly I will be
using my concealer just to cover up any
blemishes because at the moment I do
have a few pimples so I'll just be
covering that up and then blending that
out for my concealer um right now I am
using the maybelline superstay 24
concealer it looks like this and I'm
just putting it in all the dark places
on my face just so that underneath my
foundation there's no sort of pimples or
acne coming up I do find that this helps
I'm putting it on the fall of foundation
just because it helps to correct the
skin color that you have before you
apply foundation so I'm going to be
going straight in with my foundation now
I'm going to start by using my flat
liquid foundation brush I tend to put it
on my brush first and then I put it
straight onto my face
so after foundation it's time to finally
get bronzed up and give ourselves some
color so I will be going in with my new
by nature brush and I'll just be dipping
it in my bronzer which obviously I need
to buy some moral to suck in your cheeks
and just go straight down your
cheekbones just to give a bit of
definition so as you can see this line
looks very harsh but that's okay because
what we're going to do is come in with a
contour angled brush and just blend this
out
and then doing the exact same on the
other side dipping it in my buns first
and then also do my under my chin by
users with my big brush dipping in first
glad I need any definite definition so I
will just do a little bit under my chin
like this how much your line and then
also I do it on my eyelids and don't
worry this is not the finished look I
cancel out all this with powder this is
more of a small contour but yeah it
won't this isn't the finished look
because it is quiet intense it's finally
our our time I'm going in with my
Australis eyebrow pencil and dark brown
because I'm very affordable so I do
recommend them and I just start by
filling in my arch the leg knees
and then once I fill up my arch I'll
just be doing straight down stroke just
to fill in my tail and then keep
brushing it out brows are finally done
yes
so my life has meaning I'm going to be
going in again with the same concealer
as before
I think used to cover up the blemishes
and just use a little bit of a highlight
with this by just doing a bit of a
triangle here this will be all blended
in with my powder later on so don't
worry I know it looks crazy I'll be
going in with my ELF flawless concealer
brush and just blending it out
now that part's done it's finally time
to make my nose look like I've had
plastic surgery yet again something I
used to define my cheekbones I'm going
to go on with this brush I found that
I've used a lot smaller brushes in the
past to contour my nose and I found that
it didn't really do the job for me so
with this one it looks like crazy
interns but trust me we blend it out I'm
just going to do a line down my nose in
the natural plate really helps if you
just do another line of consumer next
the bronzer it will help to give the
illusion that you have a smaller nose
and I mean who doesn't want that know if
you can see that I'm sorry to get a bit
more of a defined line down my nose
which is awesome it looks crazy but
trust me just wait just wait and now for
the blending time I'm going to be going
with my face in Australia translucent
loose powder and it is cute and cheap so
get it so I will just be opening this up
and then annoying thing about this thing
is that you get so much product come up
so it is really annoying
what I tend to do is that I'll go in
with my brush and I will get a decent
amount like this
and then after that I will tap it onto
the tray pop all the excess and then
just use the rest of that with my face
so I'll be using my be new by nature
powder brush I'll just be blending this
in and the translucent powder is amazing
for if you want to have long-lasting
makeup that day I'm about to have an
eight hour shift work so I yeah I need
it so you'll see what I mean with my
nose um once I put this on you will see
that the line starts disappear and now I
have a straight nose and the great thing
with this palette is that it does not
have color so that it doesn't give you
that kind of cakey orange look and now
it's finally time to make me stop
looking like such an alien and give me
some mascara I always wait till I finish
with my powder to apply my mascara
simply because I find that if you apply
it before the powder you're going to end
up with eyelashes covered in powder so
it just makes sense to wait till the
very end I wish I could apply it first
because I hate how it would clear that
mascara I look weird I'll be going in
I'm using it over
essence I love extreme crazy bull you
mascara sorry I'll just be giving it a
bit of a wiggle and applying my mascara
what I mean by a little wiggle is that I
tend to do this when I apply the mascara
just because it cut just pull your
little hairs and gives you the best
outcome I like this is what I made I
look so weird without it
oh so I was fast like and I'll get the
other eyelash done oh my god that looks
so scary
yeah he's pain okay
so just doing the exact same thing it's
so hard not cool places when you apply
mascara it is a challenge all that's
left for me to do is to give my so now
I'm going to get rid of this lovely
headband and all that's left for me to
do is fill in some ellipse and give
myself some webs because my lips are
pretty much non-existent my lip liner
which is a savvy nourishing lip liner I
get again cheap option and I'm just
going to fill them in
that is me done this is what I do every
single day for work or just for small
things basically if I leave the house I
will either leave the house with no
makeup or this makeup there's no
in-between
so with eyeliner and false eyelashes and
stuff I sort of believe that only what
I'm going out like clubbing or an event
so if every day I do just do mascara I
was and thanks so that's all that I do
um please leave a comment if you enjoyed
the cheap prices of the products and let
me know what you'd like to see in the
future I'll be seeing you guys next week
I don't know what day yet so thanks so
much for watching guys I will see you
next time bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
