channel today we are talking about
eyebrows I'm a little bit obsessed with
eyebrows and you got to notice that
since I dyed my hair I've been feeling
them in a kind of a lot different and I
used to so I thought I would update you
guys on my new tie my routine well they
look like when I wake up is just
terrified my old way I used an eyebrow
pencil and it was just too light for my
hair color now when that with makeup
it's constantly changing and just
watching YouTube videos watching the
trends and then keeping up with like
whatever else it's doing then first the
time what the high thing about is legit
so I bet you that and I have got my
hands on two different brow products
which are very great about in the beauty
community
one is the Mac fluidline brow gel cream
and I got this as a Christmas present
from my auntie thank you but
unfortunately it is a little bit too
light for my eyebrows however I did use
this and you just like lit up bill to
help like the coverage of it when I had
like blonde hair go too short you can
really tell but the inside of this one
doesn't really match my hair color now
so I don't really use this one as much
anymore if anything I use it for the
inside of my brows i also am using kind
of standard velvet hills dipbrow pomade
I use the shade dark brown pretty much
is my hair a lot better than the last
one so I put the Anastasio Daisy on
Beverly Hills one on beautybay any
problem is it can be like super dark if
you like hold on like smashing your
brushes to hit anybody put it looking
eyebrows it can be really dark you just
lightly away from it and it works fine
I'm going to also demonstrate to you
guys how I feel my brows hug it from
start to finish to the last time
voiceover OH maintenance for my eyebrow
maintenance I did get them threaded
quite often but I just found that I just
pluck them now probably once every three
days or so I plucked my eyebrows and I
like to get my spoolie brush I brush the
hairs in the direction that they
naturally go and then pick them up and
then I get my spoolie brush and I brush
my hair's completely upwards and that
way all the little hairs are they like
hiding underneath you can just like be
like haha found you this is my method
which I love doing I just think it works
really well and I never ever ever ever
ever pluck from item for my eyebrows
just because I just don't want to change
the shape of them I find that play too
much with the top of your eyebrows you
will end up having very straight lines
won't really have an arch anymore the
importance of eyebrows to me is just
like critical if I'm leaving the house
and I have absolutely no makeup on I
will always find 10 seconds of my time
to run this in the mirror with even just
like an eyebrow pencil and just fill in
at least like the options of my brows
because I just hate the way my face
looks without my brows filled in and I
think it's such a good thing now that's
sort of like accepted that like women
fill in their brows it just completely
changes your face shape and it's so
amazing that we can just change the way
our face looks with a few products I
think it's really incredible so for the
application of my eyebrows I'm
demonstrating with the anastasia beverly
hills whose one i like to start this
from my arch and then work down to my
tail i don't start at the very front
hairs in my eyebrows simply because i
find it just what goes to dark and
what's really obviously some like drawn
on and create almost like a stencil
outline
and then eventually I'll go back in with
my brush and I will just brush through
with the rest of the product into the
middle of my eyebrows just to fill them
out completely a nice user can see like
this just helps to define the brows more
sharpen them out and just shake them
completely and then I blend it out
either with my finger or with a brush
so what I like to do when I finished
actually puffing on the product onto my
eyebrows and cleaning them up with a
concealer I like to go in with a brow
gel and today I just used the one from
our doll super cheap and it's less of me
almost six months now that still hasn't
run out yet so that's pretty amazing
definitely recommend a brow gel just
helps to keep them in the in place helps
to keep them in place and just stay in
the one section all day make sense at
all you know things are not gonna be
like straight hairs all over your face
so thank you for watching this video
today guys I hope it explained to you a
lot more about my new routine to filling
in my eyebrows I would definitely
recommend it buying the is worth the
money it's awesome and I covered it and
I wish I had naturally thick bushy
eyebrows if you do you are very lucky
you don't really know why you're
watching this video because I'm so
envious of your eyebrow so yeah that's
pretty much all for me to say guys if
you have any questions about ever I
mention it men in them maintenance
eyebrow routine anything like that and
please leave them in the comments and
I'll get back to you so until next time
guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
