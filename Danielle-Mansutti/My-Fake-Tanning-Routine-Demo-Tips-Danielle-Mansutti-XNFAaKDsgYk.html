today is the most requested video of all
time which is my tanning routine I
thought since I'm away it's a perfect
time to upload it so I also just want to
ask you guys a quick question to be
pauses edit the comments really fast for
me I don't have my hair extensions in
today and I was wondering if you could
let me know below
do you prefer my hair this length or do
you prefer it with hair extensions cuz
that would help me out a lot
okay so I'm sure you guys know and have
known that for years now I have used
Bondi sands I have tried so many fake
tans and bondo sounds is the only term
which works for me all the other chants
make me look like a normal number or
like I brought around in Doritos so the
reason why I fake ten is because I feel
a lot more confident when I am this
color than my natural color just is a
confidence boost for me and I just
prefer the way I look with it and also
because in Australia we have such a high
risk of skin cancer and melanoma here
because the Sun is extremely strong here
I just want to fake it till I make it so
I would rather have fake tan than be at
the Sun so someone has just passed in
Australia and I didn't really go to the
beach at awful i was expect-- tanning
instead and i know that in other
cultures fake tanning is seen as so
bizarre because obviously there's other
cultures who actually use skin whitening
so for me I just like doing it makes you
feel more confident and that is the
reason why I tend as you guys know as
well I have been active with Bondi sands
on their YouTube page if you haven't
heard of Bondi sands TV it is a little
channel which Bono sands is set up I've
done two videos for them I've done a
hair style video and also a makeup
tutorial and I'll leave them in the
description if you want to check
as well so I have filled a demo for you
guys because there's no point just me
talking I have to show you what I'm
doing as well I don't you know how I get
this finished product and also just let
you know how to prolong the ten and how
to look after your skin whilst you are
fake tense the best thing to do is to
get a really really really warm bar and
just soak your skin in the bath for a
few minutes just so it's all nice and
warm and then you use an exfoliating met
or exfoliating scrub anything like that
to sort of you scrub off as nicely as I
can put it just scrub off all the dead
skin on your body and to be completely
honest with you I really can like my
chest upwards my back and my arms I
don't really turn my tummy my lower back
or my legs because it's getting into
winter now and then on show so it looks
quite weird my skin without any clothes
on because I'm really brown up here but
really white down there but no one can
tell so I like to save my factor as much
as I can and only in the areas which are
on show and the next step for preparing
your fake ten is to shave and shaving is
also really great for getting off the
dead skin as well because it does sort
of like get the top layer of your skin
off it seems that everyone has a
different opinion on this but after I
exfoliate I do not
moisturize nor do I fight deodorant
because it actually prevents the tan
from sticking on to your skin so as you
can see I am incredibly a pale I'm not
ashamed that I'm pale at all I just
prefer being tan so the first thing that
I'm going to do is grab my Bondi sound
self-tanning foam in dark this has a
coconut scent but it is a very light
coconut scent it's not overpowering or
super smelly or anything like that so I
was going to put a few pumps onto my
tanning net I'm just going to apply it
all over my body
and now for the fun part because this is
the part which is like my little tanning
secret use a buffing brush to even out
your tan and just buff it into the skin
so you can just grab any old brush I
mean honestly just grab a tiny little
brush anything that which will buff it
into your skin
and once it's actually on your skin
you're going to want to buff it around
and it just makes it so much more
flawless into your skin and it just
works so much better so by those hands
doesn't instantly dry which is such a
good thing because when you are blending
into your skin you won't have time to
actually blend it first so once I've
applied it with the mitt I'll then go
over it with the brush until it's
completely dry and it's all blended the
right way so after application the best
thing that you can do is on some loose
clothing anything which isn't going to
rub off your fake tan isn't too tight
your skin or anything my personal
favorite thing to do is to put on a
dressing-gown or bathrobe whatever you
want to call it and just be lazy and
chill out on my bed for like two hours
watching stuff if you do at nighttime
you will wake up the next morning and
you'll be very dark but also be quite
patchy actually it's very dark and very
patchy and it's just kind of looks like
you'd be rolling on a mud run straight
to the shower jump in the shower and
once you're in the shower it will all
run down and it's almost like the
bronzer on top of the fake tan sort of
comes off and underneath you're left
with a very very natural tear the number
one most important thing to do in the
shower is do not rub anything on your
skin do not get in the shower and rub
the water all over you or anything like
that just stand in the shower let the
water let it all go down your skin but
do not rub your skin once you're out the
shower take a towel and you're going to
pat dry your skin so do not get a towel
and rub it down your skin because that
will rub off the fake tan when your skin
is wet with fake tan it's very very
delicate you wanna be very careful with
the towel so just finally grab the towel
put it around my hand and I just Pat it
along my chest until I am completely dry
and so once the 10 is completely dry
you're going to want to grab a
moisturizer moisturizer that I use is
the Bondi stands
a gradual turning milk it's a 24-hour
body moisturizer and it is a cocoa
butter scent it does smell quite amazing
it smells like something you just want
to eat it's just the best and what I
really like about the tiny milk is that
it comes out looking like a thick
moisturizer but once you actually apply
it to your skin it becomes a very very
liquidy easy thing to apply to your skin
it's not clumpy
Alfie's I would comfy and gooey I think
yeah I mix those two words up so the
whole point of moisturizing is it helps
to prolong your 10 I find that if I do
not moisturize with a plate 10 it will
take about 2 or 3 days before it gets
really patchy and quite gross but if you
moisturize after every shower I think
the longest time I've had it where that
being patchy was 2 weeks so I actually
had the same fake tan on for two weeks
but because I looked after it so well it
stayed on for so long it's only on
places where you get quite sweaty and
stuff was it coming off because of all
obviously the salty sweat would get the
tent come on if you don't moisturize
regularly just try and get into habit
doing it up to every shower or before
bed every night and you'll find that it
will last a lot longer for you there
right before I was filming today I
decided to be a little bit more bronzed
up because I wanted to just be as
bronzed as I could for this video now
I've recommended one of the Watterson's
tanning products to all of my friends
because honestly it is my life's over
it's like my Holy Grail tanning product
and that is the summer bronzed instant
10 this stuff is just heaven in a bottle
it is absolutely incredible so it's a
very very dark color but I use my brush
to blend it out and before the video I
just sprayed it very quickly onto my
chest blended it out and then I was good
to go and then the next time I hop on
the shower it will just wash off so you
don't really need the whole exfoliation
moisturising process for that it is
something which is only meant to be on
your skin for probably 24 hours or so
but it saves me so much time and effort
like if I'm going out on the weekend
last-minute I'll just spray that all
over my body and then I'm ready to go
and it's a really nice color and also
photographs really nice
if you look really turns so once your
whole tanning process is complete and
it's been probably a week is the most
time you want to kind of keep it on form
you literally just have to do the whole
process once again so once you are sick
of it and you want to get it off what's
becoming patchy then jump in the bath
again exfoliate and didn't know so on so
on so on so I hope that this is
informative for you guys and you learn a
few tips and tricks from how I apply my
fake ten I'd love to know if it helped
you in any way don't forget to check out
for my fans TV as well I'll leave all
that stuff in the description because
there's a few videos of mine you haven't
seen hiding away on that channel so I
hope you guys have a great week and I'll
be seeing you really soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
