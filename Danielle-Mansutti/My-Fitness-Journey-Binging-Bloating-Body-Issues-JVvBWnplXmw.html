today I'm here with my hustle China
Jessie I'm gonna be talking all about my
fitness journey everything all the bad
bits and all that stuff too like all my
bloating binging body issues - so about
six months ago I say I seriously started
looking into health and fitness I've
seen with Jesse three times a week for
the last six months or so yeah I'll come
you similar Gloria message man like
November that Sorento birthday I want to
start training in making changes but
like you explained that you didn't want
to go so hard yeah you know you
previously with counting really low
calories and I was like okay let's
change things and make it easier to
follow for about a year I was on off
like every single holiday I had a go to
Jesse's like free wink yeah and just
like crash diet and then come back and
then get back to being like did you kiss
pretty much but in six months ago is
when I kind of sat down I'm like we're
going to take the series you know if you
like lifestyle change instead of us diet
yes so it's Kerry Wood yeah hey you
don't want to miss binges exactly
anything at the very start it was a bit
a bit overwhelming and a bit confusing
because what I thought was healthy
wasn't necessarily healthy so there's
things in life that you kind of really
until believe like ad promoting certain
foods being healthy but they're really
not and that was the kind of food that I
was eating all the time wondering why my
energy was so weird because I was
consuming too much sugar
like with stuff like up and go or just
like music I will tell you dollars which
is yeah I was strictly like why is my
energy so Egyptian and that was the
biggest thing I had like no energy
because I wasn't really like I want to
low takes away I'm like on a tone up but
I want to sort of have a constant energy
the most important thing over the past
year
so not just elastic sponsors sort of
educating myself on nutrition because it
is the most important thing when it
comes to
the business I feel so many people you
know things might agree with them and
then then you know it might not agree
with you and that's the whole thing like
you've got okay so some people can hand
it dary and that thing but you can't
yeah so you know I can have Greek yogurt
but Danny time you know I'm not going to
be like have Greek yogurt inches and we
like yeah well there's no point like
following someone's because they got
absol yeah it's lost you know ten kilos
off that day but I really you know
figure out what works with you they
asked in the morning work with you like
you love your porridge in the morning
yeah you have that one that time people
to work it out exactly and I think it's
really important to those rather you
need to learn how your body reacts to
foods and it takes a long time to learn
that because it took me like six months
of realizing every time I come to you
like Jessie and really blows really I'm
like what did you eat yeah what are you
thinking and then we discovered that to
me it was weird that dairy and great yes
really loading every time she'd like
message read to that
ahead great Ivan I think it's super
important to sort of learn what your
body reacts to because for a long time I
got this really weird mindset where I
felt really big and really heavy and I
was eating really clean I was counting
calories and tracking my food and I
wasn't looking how I thought I should I
didn't see any difference but I was
actually looking bigger as well so that
caused a lot of like body issues and
concerns to me because I was like I
don't understand what's going on I'm
working so hard and then I get so
frustrated and then by that I would
binge I go really really really hard and
really really clean and then if I did
see results like immediately like us
doesn't matter who can be like yeah I
get that now literally like sure what
you say then you crash because you
consumed so much sugar in it and so much
energy from the carbohydrates that you
crash and anything low and you feel
crappy about binging and stuff in this
vicious cycle it is and it's about
finding like on a diet like you don't
want to be like I'm constantly craving
things I'm hungry all the time you want
it to be sustainable like I said before
and that's what we did with you is that
we okay eight more lets up your calories
I don't like focusing so much on
calories at the moment but it was a
thing we had to do
to kind of reverse from what Danny was
doing clearly and we did learn that and
I think we found a really good place
with you now and I'm really proud of her
like she's done so well like if you you
know you learn to like enjoy yourself
here and there like you know you had
your fondue with your mom the other day
and you know those are special moments
because you know Danny's hasn't got much
fun with a mom anymore and now I'm not
that strict on what I'm eating but I'm
making good choices like I think the
biggest thing is it all comes down to
what you buy at the supermarket whatever
you buy if you know it's bad you know
you're going to eat it that's one thing
I've trained myself I was like I need to
just stop going in the middle of
supermarket and just do my shopping on
the out good I did track my food I'm
like Fitness helps a little while and
that actually educated me to knowing
what was in my food nutrition was
dissecting my food and realizing how
much like protein carbohydrates and fat
were in my food was vital for me
learning it's going to make me feel
really good or really full or it's going
to give me use of energy so tracking
through for about three months or so
really helped me now to look at food and
identify like that's good for me
she's like I can eat like a kilo of
strawberry yes or like two bananas which
is I can't eat a kilo of story I was
just looking at you know the value and
you know if she's a snacker and she
wants to keep eating and having that you
know sensation just finding something
that she can keep eating not something
so dense so before I started training at
gym as well I am sure you have balance
as well got sucked into the world of
Pittsburgh looking at all these fitness
gurus who suggest 5 million different
ways to get abs or get a big bomb or
whatever and I read all them and they
don't contradict each other and I'm so
confused in understand you look at
someone on Instagram and you think oh my
god that I can achieve that body if I
just go to gym and work really hard but
that's the body that they've worked for
for like 6 7 8 years but for me
personally I don't have a raging
six-pack after all I have like you know
bitter side over my tummy and so even
though I train 3 times a week but that's
my choice as well because I want to do
this as a lifestyle thing and
did start this would be intention of
wanting to look like the fitness goal I
wanted to have like the big six-pack I
wanted to have like all like the tone
muscles and stuff and at one point I did
have that unlike a board line as I woke
up when I saw these ads and stuff but I
wasn't very happy because the lifestyle
that I was living in order to get that
wasn't realistic for me and it didn't
work with my everyday life yeah and you
know your everyday life is like you all
all of a sudden go to Disney and it's
just like it's very hard to keep that in
control especially if you're not like
Dani doesn't have to do a lot of photo
shoot we don't know so it's really like
no point putting the stress just because
she can wake up in the mirror and be
like cool I look good it's just about
choosing which is important for you and
having the energy I think for your
workers like you don't probably see the
behind the scenes like you see the
recording and you see that upload but
editing on laptops till 11 o'clock at
night and garnets label my case and
doing again yeah so it's a lot of you
know mental yeah mental energy
yeah the biggest thing and obviously
just getting the motivation to go to gym
three times a week as well that's
something I've got really been writing
and presented like she can join in right
now see what ideas for a good gym it was
for something like it was for a holiday
or was before my birthday or whatever
and then when I dig on the holiday or I
did go overseas and I did trendle and I
hate that I came back and I'm like what
I can't with all the training because
I've lost it now I kind of think I have
lost some momentum Jim makes me feel
good because it makes me feel strong and
it makes me feel proud of myself and
because my job is quite isolating and I
sit here all day every day by myself
like going to gym is just like it's a
good thing to me mentally as well when
you so challenge yourself and you
actually do it and you actually exceed
it as well when it comes to gym I just
the way you're listing all the exercise
you're doing is pushing yourself it is
just a really really great feeling
loving the body results are like a bonus
yes yeah and I do have sessions when I
feel quite low orbit interests and stuff
and then I leave you know am I not feel
like I had the best workout because I
didn't have a lot
I do that morning or something but I
always feel proud of myself for going
you know and I think that is what pushes
me yes okay you're gone yeah now it's
something that I like doing for myself I
think that's amazing because I was doing
it for the wrong reasons at the start I
know that now I think they're creating
more stress on your body than anything
because mentally you're thinking oh my
gosh I need to look at certainly provide
to you in Chamonix oh my gosh I want to
do exercise yeah exactly every girl
looks like this for high school work
yeah exactly
and you know it's like you said in your
previous video I want the body I want to
be knows the perfect hair face makeup
everything lifestyle and at the end of
the day you know you've just got to
figure out what you've got to do and the
stress that you put under yourselves
actually sets you back in Ventura and
your hormones can actually make you you
know strengthen your hair folder and
yeah when she's under stress I'm like
your hair is everywhere oh my god only
very fun yeah it lightly is for doing it
a lot yes the back stress actually can
take a toll on your body I can hold
water from it and you know you can
actually you know stop your progress so
you know I think once you've taken out
the stress I know a little bit back at
the moment but once you to put away and
you talk the stresses eating perfectly
or keeping your mouth closed basically I
think your progress moves even further
forward definitely and I feel because I
was following a lot of like what
Instagram girls are telling me to do yes
their life I was so different because
they were competing in shows for their
body and everything so they were really
really strict about their macros and my
macros if you had all nice and golden
ear macronutrients they're protein fats
and carbohydrates for example they will
give them you know 150 protein 120 grams
of carbs and then like 55 and you happen
to hit those throughout the day so for
breakfast videos you could have porridge
and that's like 50 carbs and your onion
protein and all that kind of stuff
that's what we mean by it
so you literally count everything all
day and it's very stressful yeah I'm
dissecting everything that goes into
you know I'm looking at the nutrition
label me like yeah I can fit that in my
macros yeah exactly and that's what I
was doing so I was like well you know
this girl me she doesn't so I'm going to
do it as well and so we long time to
realize that hey I don't I don't need to
be doing this like it's good to have
just some idea of how much I'm putting
into my body but I don't need to be
dissecting it and things so have myself
like I'm about to do a body butter cream
yeah exactly you know I said on sale I I
was getting so much misinformation
online from I don't know from everyone I
guess I'm social media really
overwhelming yes and you know that's why
they're saying how important it is to
figure out something that works to you
you know having inspiration and that
from people is great but you just got to
find your own yes I know that's very
hard - yeah sure that I have to be like
I'm trying to do that with my life
I suppose also when it does come to
following your own path everyone's why
you responds differently to Jim as well
I'm responsible eat food so personally
we found that my legs have grown
stronger and my upper body my back is
improving I can't see but Jackson tells
me how much clericalism yeah which is
guys I'm like oh I can see my back and I
really don't like the plan but I'm like
that looks kind of muscly but I'll talk
about my glutes to my clothes and stuff
are changing check the most I've
everywhere answering in Changsha
everyone yes would you like is she still
live I don't see that either so time I
don't know some other people is they've
trained the way that I've trained they
might have liked being sure there's a
bigger arms with all dependent on the
way that your body is built as well so I
think if you want to start your own
health and fitness journey it's to start
it with no expectations like to start it
with a very open mind set that's the one
thing I didn't do I had like a goal and
I was like she was like I had to fight
on my side while I want to look like and
it was just ridiculous like I can't
change my wanting to like someone else's
bloody mm-hm I can improve my body the
way that it looks but it's just
unrealistic messaging you know people is
not as much I guess Bowl is like I've
hadn't got many but I get messages from
girls
going like what I do like you know what
diet so I follow I like you know what
it's an inspiration or what what do I
look for and it's just like those little
tips can help going to the gym with a
friend isn't really good to doing that
you can both make mistakes together
go get out yeah and it's just finding
someone if you can't really afford a
personal trainer just trying to fix the
information from someone who you admire
but you don't is my best body as much it
just implies that I get the way of life
in Melanesia and their attitude
everyone's body is different and ice
Danny was saying like what's the point
of walking out with someone who's got
like you know he's probably 5 foot 2
yeah which is like five foot ten of
course it's not going to look the
Saviour going okay well I want to look
like that you just you just can't and I
think the best thing is to look at your
own body uh no not look analyzer scares
all night broad in the solid or and do
that and just thought the way you want
to you know don't go no matter because
everyone's got big shoulders at the
moment I was going to be bomber I want
to be fun right the trend yeah so just
do it the way you want to do it like you
know if you're happy you're happy and
that's what you want on you just want to
find your own happiness ISM you're a
physical state but I do know that if I
have learned to like get a raging
success in like become really sort of
stuff like I'm going out how to get
there but for me it's not a realistic
thing to do it all the time I love
chocolate too much I just like know I
love my comfort food and I plan on
keeping a balanced lifestyle where I can
involve a lot of health and fitness but
I'm not going to make myself feel guilty
if I ever eat something bad that's
something that we found I had an issue
with yes I feel very guilty I'd almost
want to like punish myself for eating
badly yeah I remember
Danny messaging me and I was like I saw
I had some shot I think I don't know
around Christmas or something and she
was like I had some chocolate and I ate
too much
don't worry I'll just eat less tomorrow
and I was like no no that's another
funny stuff stuff who cares just
continue with what I go vegan really
don't punish yourself because once you
get into a pattern of punishing yourself
and like I need to do what an hour of
cardio I need
I do another team sessions you become
tired and just become irritable and
stressed and just not happy exactly and
tokoto everybody anyway
yeah I'm sitting that way and I think
unfortunately for me I had a few things
stuck in my head from a different
trainer so it's very important I feel to
find the right trainer as well because I
had advice from someone else saying that
I should eat really it was a really big
calorie deficit it was like what does an
interesting that surrounded me Andrews
when it was your visit yeah
and she was like ah and what do I do you
like you know what do I follow I'll
donate your gain and just a diet for
dinner eat what you want yes and I was
like yeah they said I'm literally like
on your birthday don't eat anything but
then I have one meal for dinner to make
up your whole calories a day it was just
so bad because I was like why am I not
eating right now like I shouldn't be
eating this I should be eating right
Daniel I screwed up we were after a year
and a half ago she was like probably
eating Oh a lot of three talking we
didn't go Victoria you know you can eat
a lot just make a substitution yeah and
then yeah when you and back nothing why
are you eating that much you got a
really good metabolism like not
remembering and one thing that I've
learned I think it's very important is
that obviously by restricting yourself
from food it's actually going to damage
you more in the long run if you're like
I feel worthy so I'm not going to eat my
breakfast so I'm going to skip this meal
it actually is very damaging and I did
get in a mindset for a little while
where I was like well okay I'll just eat
like something big for lunch and that
would be like my whole day okay yeah
yeah and then I'll be really skinny I'll
lose lots of weight and I start with
like lots of different body issues and
last year with this but I feel that for
me though was damaging because it's very
easy when you're very very very just
obsessed with your food to be almost not
like red of eating this sort of it would
create an unhealthy relationship with
food I was on that road where I was I
had no energy I actually wasn't losing
weight so so stressed out
yes
yes and I was just like it just wasn't
working command I felt miserable yeah so
miserable yeah and the thing was is that
because you're eating just the same
amount of calories per day
previously your body just kind of just
adapt to it and you know sometimes if
you feel hungry you've a sign that you
should eat more yeah you know so having
let me know I say to have an extra two
bananas that that just for example you
know that could help you and boost your
energy so like you could continue losing
weight or reaching your goals I don't
look like a public person know I
probably don't a lot of people like are
you training for five years and you look
like that but at the end of the day I
have learned so much I've actually when
I started my fitness journey probably
when I met my partner I was actually on
borderline like starving myself and that
was really really really concerning
because I was probably in the same state
as Danny so it's just showing you that
you know even the people who look like
they've got it all together have gone
through a journey have learnt and you
know that's the way to actually do your
own journey as well it would definitely
and I think Jesse's a prime example for
the girls that are scared to lose weight
American five years old and nice it's
not like a big bulky you know you know
Gary person yeah that's the question I
think to get a lot man you know I'm
gonna get bulking Felix weights and
stuff that I achieve I go to any cardio
no I walk to the fridge and I was pretty
much it yes okay for a nice literally
quite lucky that my body is actually
bounce back I'm eating a lot more food
now that I was if you might see my body
hasn't really put on that much for
myself and I'm like a kilo but
considering how much we'll see right now
I mean my metabolism is coming back and
I'm like yeah it smell great you're
still lifting more like she's still
training yeah and that's the thing like
you can't judge it cuz you know in life
just because you've gained a kilo and
your training and all that kind of stuff
like you'd still like fit into clothes
alright and not you not like you're a
kilo of fat straightaway right again
your body competition will always change
and I think that's the biggest thing
like you've probably seen photos on
Instagram of girl to like 62 kilos in
one photo like 58 kilos in another and
actually look better in the 62 kilos
don't be afraid of weight gain when you
start weight training yes but number
means nothing at all actually exactly
not just to do the post about that
yesterday yeah if you do want motivation
make proper motivation I would recommend
following Jessie's accounting is it's
like realistic information it's not like
do this to get super skinny get out it's
like hey we all feel crap sometimes but
that's how it is I think if you are Chi
Chi when you're just doing cardio and
stuff and you know why not try doing it
that way yeah you know because it's
something I was terrified of because
when I first which gym the weights room
which is men and I was like oh my god
what going in now I was like 18 I'll
terrify my walking I felt super
intimidate but it'll don't make
something I was doing as well yeah
always ask the help even if it's just
someone working at the gym that's one
thing I didn't do and if I kept doing
that would really injured myself cause
