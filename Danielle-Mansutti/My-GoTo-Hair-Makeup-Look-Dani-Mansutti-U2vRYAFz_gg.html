channel in today's beer I have my go to
hair and makeup look I just wore this
through the whole VidCon weekend I had
my first ever pick on it would speak on
Australia it was amazing it was
incredible it was terrifying and if you
watch my blog I'll have it in a card
right here for you so this is the look
that I wore like most of the weekend and
I also have a sneaky little new alert
for real in this video which I am just
beyond excited to finally share with you
and before I dive straight into this
video if you're not already subscribed
to my channel I would love if you would
hit that big red button down below and
turn on my belt for the notifications I
applied to new videos every single week
and I would love to have you on mode and
with that further ado let's jump into it
and we're gonna get right into this so I
have done my brows and my foundation my
foundation is the Urban Decay all
nighter foundation brows are the
Anastasio dip brow pomade in dark brown
and today we are joined by guys but
firstly we're gonna start with um
prepping our eyes so we're gonna use the
heart shape tape concealer and a Beauty
Blender and just going to literally
smother this on the lids and then we're
gonna do my setup right now is not the
greatest I'm actually gonna hold this
like massive mirror sorry my love's but
I actually can't find anywhere in the
house which has a table and a window hey
this is what we're doing today we are
using the morphe Jacqueline Hill
palettes which are covered in like
orange mark damn we're gonna start with
this shake here I'm gonna use a big
fluffy brush this is a Mac two to four
brush and dip it in and all we're gonna
do is a lightly dust that into our
crease we're gonna use this as our
transition shade it's a really really
really nice soft matte Brown
and we're just going to gradually go a
little bit darker as we go so now I'm
going to take this really nice warm
shake here I wish the names actually on
the pallet makes it so difficult so I'm
just going to use the same brush and
apply it over that light crease color so
that we have a little bit like a
gradient going on and then progressively
tap out or once again we are gonna
actually head in with this really deep
dark brown shade once again we're gonna
do something they will actually focus it
a little bit more on my out of the only
just to like give some definition and
depth to my Olivia if it makes any sense
whatsoever
basically I'm putting it on the outer
part of my eye so now it is time for the
really really really fun part we're
gonna add the gold the gold that I use
I'm obsessed with is this Inglot pigment
which is an AMC pure pigment one to four
it is so stunning it's ridiculous I'm
just gonna wet my brush just using a
flat kind of brush I'm just gonna add
some cosmetic glitter glue but some of
this color of my lid and then seriously
a look at this pigment it is oh my god I
thought I was gonna drop it then it's so
stunning apply that gold lead
so you can see how beautiful that gold
pigment looks it's just the most
stunning pigment my second golf event
that I've ever come across that that's
for show just dipping my brush into that
dark brown shade before and I'm just
gonna go back over that line so now our
eyes are mostly on I'm just going to
take my top shape tape once again and
I'm gonna concealer underneath my eyes
and also use this to clean up the lines
as well make sure they're nice and crisp
and straight something I've loved to do
recently it's grab my Too Faced Born
This Way powder and use this with my
Beauty Blender underneath my eyes okay
let's go dip some powder into the tray
like that amount and then dip my Beauty
Blender just a little bit and then I'm
just going to have that powder over my
concealer this actually helps so much
with creasing and stuff and this powder
is just like heavenly you boarded this
now let me take outside it'll be one so
I'm using the benefit already set brow
gel which is an absolute godsend it's so
good ok next step let's do mascara
instead let's finish off the eyes
actually why should I just go before
I've no idea
it's really weird I'll be using the
Tarte lights camera lashes don't know we
say lights camera action lashes under
but anyway I was gonna kill my lashes
first I need to lash lift and I got that
right in my tee don't this next part I
am very excited that I can finally like
to tell you about it and it is so early
that what I'm going to be using is
actually one of the samples one of the
many samples that I have because I'm
still waiting for my new packaging which
I designed to
but I'm gonna show you one of the new
styles of Danny beautiful ashes I can't
believe that I'm saying this because I'm
just so excited about it I cry to show
you so I want you to meet one of the new
lush Styles these are 3d silk eyelashes
they're fluffy they're beautiful they're
high-quality and this is shook and here
are the lashes I've worn this pair once
already and you can see all like the 3d
and the stacked layers and everything so
they are pretty silk big and cruelty
free everything like that and they will
be coming out hopefully in October if
not maybe sooner but we shall see an off
the tray here's how they look with my
little tweezers so this is one of a few
styles that I'm bringing out there all
of sound quality and same material but
I'm just so excited to finally show you
this because I have people working on
this for the longest time in the world
you know on the tray and I'm so excited
to show you that your packaging and
everything oh my goodness it seriously
feels like sorry we've made for me to be
like talking about some camera because
it's been like the biggest secret oh yes
these are the super style and I hope you
guys love them because they are just
seriously so fluffy so beautiful and the
flashes are on both mines now and moving
on to bronzer i'm using the balm Bahama
Mama who I've used bronzer how about my
cheekbones actually can't see anything
on this mirror so I need to need to go
when I could actually see it did you
think before today there's like two
people in the world
tally being one of them who knew about
it so I'm so so so to Billy's
but if all goes well I think October
will definitely be the time where you
guys will be able to get your own hands
on them but they are just so I'm going
to use this shade here for like the
fade-out color I mean is this like the
really tight lining bit so I'm
take it on this is a Knicks 31 brush and
blend that out quite far down might seem
you know a bit is that better this is
like a flat brush I just like the way
the bristles are it works really well
for using it like on its side like this
and once again and then with a pencil
brush I'll graph like the really deep
dark brown shade that we use and oh my
god oh my god oh my god I did not do
that I can't believe I just did that so
mm anyway anyway I'm just gonna yeah
very tightly this pencil brush put some
mascara on the lower lashes is level and
now it is highlight time I'm going to
use the hourglass brilliant strobe light
time to spray up just to make sure it
will last all night even though I'm
filming this at 10:00 in the morning
there's not this like little mini travel
sized one okay so cute as well and
Phillips I'm using my episode trusty
Tartus lip paint in Rose a if you ever
wonder what look I'm wearing it's not
gonna be rosy
knowing take the Mack spice lip liner
and just apply over the top make sure
the shape is all like intact do
everything like that so now for the hair
portion it's actually not too hard at my
ears I go upwards about two here and
that's going to pour that back bit away
I'm left with like this much hair then
grabbing a hair brush I just lightly
brush the front part out this is so
difficult without a mirror and then what
I'm gonna do is just take my brush and
brush everything back and I'm actually
gonna tie it quite high up on my head so
that we have the nice hair like
spiraling downwards from the top so I
just lay my head forward and then with
my hair towel we just got it tied into
place and then once that's done I'm just
gonna tighten it once it's like pull it
forward you have like the bits coming
down at this side as well which is like
really nice for the front is like quite
flat right now so I will have to curl it
and I'll show you how I curl it as well
so when it does come to like curling
front pieces or curl in the back or
anything like that I actually use a
straightener I just find it a little bit
quicker I suppose so the way I like to
do it is I'll straighten down until my
eye then I'll flick it away from my face
and just pull it down like that when I'm
left with this curl then I'll just use
my fingers to break it apart a little
bit and then once again on this side
straight down to my eye turn and then
pull through like that you can see that
it kind of like contours your faces all
for me it makes my face look like really
slim so I'm like I love it so this is
pretty much the whole hair and makeup
that I was wearing like the whole
weekend and I hope you guys really
enjoyed it and please let me know if
you're excited by the lashes because I'm
so excited you guys finally know about
that so I'll see you guys
soon I've been brilliant week until next
time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
