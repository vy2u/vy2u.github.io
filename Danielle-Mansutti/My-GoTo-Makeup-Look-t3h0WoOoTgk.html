today's and makeup tutorial I'm going to
show you how I apply literally the
makeup where they work all the time this
is my go-to makeup looks like then it's
not that anything like that I just find
it so versatile to wear so many
different things and I was exact makeup
at gen BD so everything that I'm putting
on my face is my put on bTW if you
haven't seen the blog since 10 video I
will leave it to you and without further
ado let's get into it
oh now we're recording I'm sorry I'm
just redoing my carnation as always
using the decay or not a foundation
nearly done though because my camera
wasn't actually recording my section
which is really annoying I create
straight into brows today because yeah
my camera decided not to film that but
first things first I'm going to grab a
spoolie brush and just get all this
foundation out of my browned
now I'm taking benefits cab Rao and in
the shade all I'm going to using a
little brush but it comes with and this
is the shade of number 4 so I could
start from the middle of my eyebrow like
this and then just gently follow the
shape and then just kind of flick at the
tail and then once I've got hardly any
product left on my brush I will start to
fill in the front
I'm going to fill in any gaps like we
have here on the side
and I'm going to paint that on beyond
highbrow flow and now I'm taking a skin
colour conceal and we need it to clean
up the shape of the ground cancel ooh
bit all over the place a little bit
underneath and then I'll use the excess
to go over the top and that's Mitchell
my brows stay in place all day I'm going
to take the Ready Set growl for benefit
X whether you I'm self service product
it all this really is my favorite when
it comes to setting my eyebrow hairs in
place all day I've tried so many other
eyebrow gels and this one for me is the
best it's a little bit hard like your
brows will become a little bit hard but
that's perfect means that they will not
move all today along and I'm with it and
the final steps of brows is gimme brow
this one is in the shade 5 when you
actually do your brows like I do
sometimes are the light hits you can see
your light natural eyebrow hairs
underneath and this products me prevents
that it just makes your natural eyebrow
hairs with a lot darker and it honestly
is a lifesaver especially when like you
I put on the gym and stuff like that
it's so good and I'm taking my top shape
take in the shade light it has
deliberate from my travel makeup bag I'm
just going to be applying this and a
little signing that underneath my eyes
because for my god a little bit a long
way with this product and it's
incredibly light but this way it
actually makes me the blood away which
is always good and now that my skin
amazing be nice pressed pattern Beach
which I'm running so incredibly low on
which the gone through
like 20 of these I liked 20 I am
obsessed my face to set my skin makeup I
do actually find this pad is so hard to
find which is a nightmare I could find a
Mesa for that started in the US which
was a little bit tricky I don't like it
my from Mecca in Australia it looks like
a massive stuff up now I'm taking the
good old hoola bronzer by benefit the
most gorgeous bronze in the holotype
world and I'm going to just run down on
my cheekbones and then blend it up with
in a circular motion just to get
sometimes how much you love a product
like I'm very loyal to my products once
I used specific products I always use
them and I started using the whole at
once again when I went to Jen BT and the
benefit event in LA and I just like
rediscovered it again and now I'm
looking at it I'm like it's hard good
youth remember how good they spark
someone you need to begin your leg day
yeah I brought a little bit of the hoola
bronzer and then with this banana powder
by Oprah I'm just going to apply a
little bit underneath my eyes and also
use it to blend out that nose contour as
well now with a broad day I Drive by
Oprah which is important eyeliner and
it's going to
soon Oh shiny it's now my favorite part
which is I as you can see my magnetic
palette when I travel with it everything
smashes in it hmm I really need my more
magnetic palette you guys know the best
Weiland please let me know because look
at what this looks like
dad we makeup geek shadows keep smashing
and it makes me a loser anyway RIT
shadows are pleased you easily kind of
look very good so what I'm going to do
today is the general makeup look that I
wear all the times I was at Jen Beauty
Elisha war actually every single day and
I wore a lot of young Valley North kind
of stuff so essentially I like to use a
really really really warm tones in the
palette so we've got this bad boy this
one this one and just crumpled that one
here which is one of my favorites and I
need to obviously restock that and then
I might use a little bit at this as well
so that's that would be licensed College
based and then work my way up that way
it smells a really really nice gradient
first part we're gonna use is this one
called
early-bird which is by a makeup geek I'm
just taking a blending brush dipping it
into the shadow and of course having a
pet expense
I don't have any specific way of doing
this and in a neat way or anything like
that
I literally all just go back and forth
like so and it's a bit more in and then
go back and forth again and then also
start to drag it down my lower lash line
and to be honest I found with eyeshadow
these days that you know just throwing
in a brush isn't really that bad like
right now I'm literally just going all
over the place with it and I'm not being
too specific
not only does it save so much time but
then the day it kind of looks the same
anyways it's kind of like that's whether
I'm going to take this shape called
Hoppe which is also by it make up your
cosmetics and this one is like a really
saaphyri's pinky red and I will actually
go do the exact same thing with the
exact same brush
except over the top of that color so I'm
going to ensure that there's still a
little bit of that
pink above it but kind of phased out
lighter but again I'm just going to put
that in the exact same place in my eye
and just blend and then I'm going to
take this shade called Morocco which is
a few shades darker again this is by
makeup geek and I'm going to apply this
but a little bit lower than the other
one so this one's going to be more
concentrated on my lid but I'm also
going to try and lend it a little bit
into this outer corners here and the
reason why I love warm tones personally
is that it is the opposite color to my
eye color on the color wheel by wearing
colors that are literally parallel to
your eye color your eyes will pop so the
more are these colors the bluer that my
eyes look as well so it's always very
flattering if you do have blue eyes to
wear warmer times as well and I'm taking
this shade here called cocoa bear which
is also by makeup geek with a pencil
brush I know they're such mega on my
hands I just caught up and then I'm
going to darken up my lower lashline
concentrating to be really close to the
lashline and not drag it down too far
and then what I like to do is I like to
flick my brush upwards following my
lower lashline kind of creating a little
bit of a winged shade just following it
up like just very lightly no I'm um what
the hell so now that our highs are
really warm to touch them from SCARA I'm
going to use the roller lash I benefit
an absolute favorite of mine and
going to put this mainly on my hot
lashes and I'll also apply a little bit
into the outer corner my bottom lashes
as you can see next
it's eyelash type I'm going to take
these smitten rushes by eyes by lashes
which you can buy on Danny video comb
and I've already use these lashes rest
three times already and that is one
reason why I love this style integers or
they're so reusable three times and they
honestly do not look bad at all for
three times of worth where and why screw
it all that kind of stuff they're really
going to enhance my natural lashes so
what I like about the smitten style is
that they don't look like you're wearing
false lashes they just look like what
you have really long lashes so I'm going
to pop these on now cap my lashes are
looking along and beautiful there it's
one step left which is coolidge so I
actually don't use a lipsticks all the
time because I don't like the feeling of
lipstick on my lips so I will show you
my little tip of what I do the majority
of time I'll just grab a lip like
slightly one shade different than my lip
color lip liner this is a really old one
from Mac that I've had since forever as
you can see it's just like destroyed
it's called supply and I'm going to line
my lips and also add a little bit liner
onto my lip and I put like a lip gloss
over the top I find that it just feels
such nicer than having a lipstick on
lipsticks just make my lips feel so
dries it's really nice to do sometimes
okay so what is patchy a.m. which is
totally fine I would take a lip gloss
this one is a mechanical medica lip
gloss is the nude lips lips protectant
I'm going to apply this on top of the
lip liner and here is the finished look
I hope you guys enjoyed this get ready
with me today this is the makeup that I
wear all the time to be ever see on
Instagram deal with it so I hope you
guys enjoyed and I'll see you next time
