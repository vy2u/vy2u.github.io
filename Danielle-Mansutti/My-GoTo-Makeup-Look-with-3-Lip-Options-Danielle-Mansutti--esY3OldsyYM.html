today I am doing my go to a makeup look
for my eye shadow at my face I'm also
showing you a really different of lip
combos at the end I would love to know
in the comments which lip combo is your
favorite at the end of this video I'm so
excited to show the lipsticks I'm using
with you guys because they are like a
lipstick revolution I am obsessed that I
really love them I can't wait for you to
find out what they are sister the end
for that and let's jump straight into
the story today I'm going to be using is
the Rimmel match perfection and this one
is in the shade 200 soft beige and I'm
grabbing my trusty Beauty Blender I'm
just going to begin applying this on my
face I love this foundation because I
really find it to be a trick for my nice
sheer glow it's so if you guys remember
I wore this on my birthday as well
absolutely love it to pieces moving on
to my brows I'm going to using the dirty
blonde fluid line brow gel cream from
Mac and I'm just going to apply the
product following my natural shape but
just filling in more of these sections
because they're loose it's sad empty now
eyebrows it down this is the time that I
like to go to eyes because I feel like
if I knew how to post and then eyes
I've always have fall out because
eyeshadow is just like that so I love to
use the Too Faced natural eyes palette
for just like an everyday go to makeup
look this is what the how it looks like
on the inside I am going to be using
these three shades on the bottom and
we're gonna start off with honeypot and
I don't actually prime my eyelids
because I'm really rebellious so we're
going to recreate this as realistic as
possible and I'm not gonna pry my island
so I'm going to grab a second that cream
color brush and then you're using it
next another mac fix+
max mac fix+
woah struggle tale I'm going to just
spray the brush a neutral bit so that
it's going to be nice
EP so that we can grab honeypot from the
palette and I'm going to just apply this
all over my lid it's just so shiny it's
beautiful I love it
now that gorgeous shade is on we are
going to go in with me and i'm using a
sigma 838 diffused crease brush let me
go ahead and apply this as my crease
color
I'm gonna weave in this shape here
called chocolate - martini I'm just
using the same brush but putting it on
the outside now mixing heaven and silk
Teddy and the nieces as my under eye
brow highlight so the very thick brush
I'm just patting this underneath my
eyebrow and now I'm applying a lash
domination by bare minerals on my lashes
but are we doing my bottom lashes after
we've done up card and later on I just
find that if we do know that if I do
bottom lashes
and then do powder my bottom lashes just
become blue powdery so we'll do that
nature my lashes today I'm using the
para number 43 these are gorgeous just
like in the natural sort of everyday
flash and I think I'm obsessed with Cara
eyelashes and they're super affordable
so definitely recommend checking out so
I have a question for you guys when it
comes to eyelashes do you prefer using
your fingers or tweezers because this is
a debate my friends they all use their
fingers and I'm like tweezers are the
way to go so are you guys tweezer or
finger people and now for concealing I'm
going to use the Rimmel wake me up
concealer this consumes so much and it
goes so well with the foundation as well
so I'm just going to place it underneath
my eye and with my Beauty Blender I'm
just going to blend it out and we're
trying the shape you can also use this
part to clean up any eyeshadow if you
want and to set my face today I'm using
the Rimmel stay matte powder he's going
to apply this all over my face
and I'm going to go back in with the
natural eyes palette and I'm going to
take honeypot again what I'm going to do
I'm going to start here and then finish
honeypot back here then we're going to
go back in with chocolate martini I'm
going to do the rest of my lower
lashline then taking a lash domination
once again and I'm going to this on my
lower lashes but I'm not going a whole I
am just going to do it
smooth from the outside to halfway it's
now time to get some definition in this
paste I'm going to use the Too Faced
chocolate Soleil bronzer which is this a
gorgeous janky-ass I'm going to fly it
with a sea much small contour brush
I'm also going to bring it up to my
temples at McCoy and then I'm also going
to add a little bit down the sides my
noise my blush I'm it using the Smashbox
paradise of lush display a little bit
because sometimes like a servable blush
and it's just like we're going for
clouds today and the final step for our
face makeup today is highlight I'm using
the mary lou manizer highlighter i'm
gonna use it on a more feet mv8 brush
very lightly tap it on don't look like
dirty I think I look at my finger and I
run this down middle I love this pot
makes me so happy
okay I am so excited for this next part
because I have a new product to share
with you which I'm obsessed employee and
bring will have done a lipstick
revolution I have done it the only one
lipstick and I have the range with me
here so I want to show you three
different lip options that I would wear
with this look and honestly who goes
these lipsticks lasts all day and they
are so moisturizing and so perfect so
I'm really really really excited sharing
to do i will swatch them feed birds and
then I'll show you what these three
different options with some lip liners
look like on me with this look so the
only one is a new hybrid formula is so
moisturizing long wearing it's
comfortable it has high impact color and
the one I'll try on first is called
cheeky coral this is number 61 oh and
this shoe is so stunning and so girly
we're gonna go ahead and just watch that
for you now and you can see how creamy
and moisturizing and amazing it looks
especially to line my lips I'm going to
use the Rimmel exaggerate this is a full
color or lip liner and this is in the
shade the best move ever
peachy peachy thank you Sam's gonna line
my lips firstly with this
and this is like a really nice summary
Karl looking for your side away this
lipstick with this eye I join my going
to be choice for my eyes had no idea
what they say now I'm going to reapply
cheeky Karl on top and they still just
made for each other I swear it's lip
liner and this lipstick of the best
thing together all right how amazing is
this shade I love it it's so fun it's so
vibrant it's just like well I love how
like the coral shade complements the
golden eyes as well I think it's such a
nice looking feel like spring or summer
I like the next but lip option is eight
one zero
it's just call it one of a kind and it
is honestly it's so gorgeous
I'll just quickly it's watch this next
to you the other ones you can see it
this is like a very very very vibrant
amazing basic I'm going to use the
Rimmel exaggerate full color lip liner
this is called 105 and is going to post
my lips first now we apply a wine
defined over the top
honest to god this is so creamy so nice
and here is the second option I love
this look like a date night or something
I think this would just be so stunning
and so sophisticated and elegant and
using the lip liner without lipstick as
well works really well as like an ombre
effect because the lip liner is actually
more purple and lipsticks more red no
there's like two toned lip thing going
on and I'm loving it my third and final
with options day we have 7:10 easy does
it which is this amazing shade this
shade is absolutely beautiful I'm just
going to quickly swatch it on my hand
here just watching it quickly on my hand
is this gorgeous shade right here and
then here we have with the third and
final shape I absolutely love this
little combo with the eyes and the lips
so beautiful and I just find that this
easy does it shave match to so many
different I looks as well just one of
those really versatile sort of brownie
nudes and it's so creamy and so
hydrating it's so moisturizing and so
long wearing that I absolutely love this
like in everyday use as well
so it's like take a huge thank you for

combo was your favorite I'll see you
