today I am finally doing a smokey eye
tutorial I wanted to do this for so long
but I've always been kind of worrying
because it never turned out the way I
wanted to so I've been practicing my
butt off and I finally finding finally
found a way to do a smokey eye which
suits me so hopefully I will show you in
this tutorial the tips and tricks that
I've found for a perfect smokey eye and
it will help at least somewhat of you so
I really really really hope you guys
enjoy this tutorial today and let's get
straight to it I'm starting off with my
lash and my part that created by
position and lower lash grows and curls
your eyelashes and low brow fills out
your eyebrows so it's just an easy once
a day application and you apply it like
a liquid eyeliner and as you guys know
I'm blind as a pet so it is very safe
for contact lens wearers and sensitive
eyes as well each demi tube lasts about
three months and it is internationally
sold so I'm just telling you guys about
this because I have seen some crazy
crazy crazy rapid visible results my
eyelashes are so curly and long now it's
crazy they do have a 90 day money-back
guarantee in case you were wondering and
they do not test on animals which is
awesome so as you can see I have a bit
of a patch of eyebrow hair which is
missing here I like to just apply the
library onto that section just to ensure
it grows sehun so now I'm just going to
fill in the brows I do have a eyebrows
tutorial up on my channel if you want to
see it more in depth so I just thought I
would fill them in before my eye makeup
just because eyebrows help to frame the
face and I just wanted to get my
eyebrows out the way first this time
it's totally up to you if you want to do
it that way or not so now we're taking a
tapered blending brush and using a
medium brown shade as our transition
shade so just pop this above your crease
and just blend it up to your eyebrows
very softly we don't want to make it too
harsh because this is just a transition
shade and it will
soften up the really dramatic dark smoky
eye so now using a small tapered
blending brush with a more warmer brown
color we're just using this transition
shade just to create almost like layers
in our eyes just darkening up the crease
and so on
and now I'm using a concealer brush with
the lightest shade in my palette and
just popping this underneath my eyebrow
as a highlight and right now your eye
should be looking like this and now with
the darkest shade from your palette just
pack this onto your eyelid completely so
only the eyelid itself don't blend it
outwards or into the crease or anything
like that just stop at your crease or
just under and pack on as much as you
like to get the darkest effect that you
desire I'm taking the tapered blending
brush once again with this warm brown
shade and I'm just going to use this to
blend the black upwards into the crease
and because black is a very unforgiving
color I'm just doing this gradually just
to make sure that it's all blended in
nicely and not just like super super
super dark or way too light so now I'm
going to pack on some more black because
I just want to darken up a little bit
more and I'm using a blending brush once
again with this orange shade and I'm
going to use this just to create a soft
transition at the very top of the I give
it a little bit of warmth to the
eyeshadow and now using a eyeliner I'm
just going to tightline and I'm also
going to apply the eyeliner to my
waterline now for cleanup I'm just going
to use a concealer and dab it in with my
fingers and then blend it out with a
brush this just helps to clean up any
fallout or any wonky lines or anything
like that and just give it more of a
crisp defined line on the outside of our
eye shadow and don't forget to set the
concealer afterwards
and now I'm just going back in with the
eyeliner to make sure it's as dark as I
want it to be phasing pencil brush would
be a warm brown shade once again I'm
just going to apply this underneath the
waterline this just helps to give it a
nice effect and match the top of our eye
as well and I'm just using this as a
blending technique using the darkest
shade from the palette once again I'm
just applying this above the brown shade
on the eye and this is just helping to
smoke at the bottom of the eye as well
next you take your favorite mascara and
apply a few coats before applying false
eyelashes so I've decided to do my
bottom lash as well but that's
completely optional and now my shaky
hands are applying some false eyelashes
this is of course optional but I choose
to do it just because it helps to make
the look look a bit more dramatic and
dark and this is the finished look I
really hope that you enjoyed it
so thank you guys very much for watching
today it means the absolute world to me

tutorial if you could leave a comment
