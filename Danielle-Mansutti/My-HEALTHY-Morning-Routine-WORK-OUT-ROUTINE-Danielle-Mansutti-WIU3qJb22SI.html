healthy summer morning routine which
honestly always starts by park jumping
on my head it has been a while since a
routine so I'll be yours don't forget to
subscribe and give this video a thumbs
up so I know you guys like this style
and after my bed is made and I feel like
I've completed the first task of the day
I'll walk to the bathroom and then it is
skincare time starting with my eye cream
to wake me up I'm using the Estee Lauder
advanced night repair and I follow this
on with my LMS Pro collagen marine cream
moisturizer I am so not even funny then
I finish it off with my la roche-posay
serum and then my skin is left feeling
fab you lost
so once the beam is fed and happy I will
go and pop some music on I have a little
bit of a dent around the kitchen it just
makes me super happy and then I'm going
to boil the kettle and I'm gonna make a
green tea I use the tea to accentuate
vanilla I love this teeth so much
for my breakfast I love to make some
oats before Jim I find out they fill me
up and give me heaps of fuel so I'm just
adding some almond milk and then once
they're cooked I'll pop some honey on
the tops well I find that I personally
get the best Jim motivation in the
morning if I watch other Fitness
vloggers I love watching people like
Nikki black cutter grace fit UK etc etc
that was a bit of a weird way to sleep
hurt when I eat my breakfast while
catching up on their blogs and I feel a
bit inspired and ready for the gym and
of course beans is always there hoping
for a crumb to fall on the floor and
this is the time of the day that I catch
up on social media so I check your
comments I check my Instagram my Twitter
all that kind of stuff I don't do this
as soon as I wake up anymore because I
find it makes me very unproductive so
when I'm ready for gym it is time to get
dressed I shower after gym
not before personally so I'm gonna pop
on a some deodorant and some dry shampoo
guys a little bit later this morning
so now that I am feeling a little bit
fresher it's time to pop on a very very
very light makeup for the gym I'm just
gonna pop on a tiny bit of concealer
underneath my eyes then pop on at this
deal brow ink on up my brows and then a
bit of lip liner and a bit of mascara I
keep it really really natural really
simple I just don't want to scare anyone
Jim then I'm packing my hand sanitizer
at my airport and then it is straight
out the door into the car and on my way
to Jim I did an upper body workout today
focusing mainly on shoulders biceps all
that kind of jazz so here's a little
overview of what I do on my upper body
sessions
hey once I've picked up my pauses for
the day I'll open them up have a little
peek and then it is time for a protein
shake and talk
once I'm home it is now a shower time I
shower like after gym and everything and
I'm gonna put on a daddy Beauty hoodie
we have a thirty percent off sale right
now so make sure you jump on there while
you can then I'm going to grab a tea
this is the melting breakfast tea from
tea - I love this tea so much it just
like calms me down so I grab a little
snack some tea and then it is time to do
my work my emails my editing all that
kind of stuff and I'm in like a good
mindset I've done my exercise and now
it's time to be productive and work
and I am not gonna edit this video so
thank you guys so much for watching if
you want to see more videos like this
please this video a big thumbs up so
know you guys love it I love making
routines so much so until next time guys
