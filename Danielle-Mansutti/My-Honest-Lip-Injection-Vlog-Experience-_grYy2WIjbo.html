very shocked by the title this video or
just very curious to see what on earth
I'm talking about you know that I am so
open and so honest with you guys so I'll
tell you whatever anything gets done to
this face or anything like that I'm not
someone to hide things from you I have
been advised by so many of my friends
and family not to make this video
because it is just going to invite
people to send me abuse and semi
negativity and just attack me you know
what for me my values of being an open
and honest human being and actually
telling you the truth
is a lot higher than hiding something so
that I don't get a little bit of
negativity or something like that
because I'm also more than positive but
there will be a lot of people that will
click on the video dislike it and then
leave like watching it or watching my
reasons or anything so first and
foremost the most important thing I want
to stress across to you guys is that I'm
not here to sit on a platform to tell
you that cosmetic enhancements are an
amazing thing that everyone should go
and get them that is not the message
that I want to convey in this video in
this video I want to explain to you why
this is affecting me for so long and why
when I helped with it for my own
personal reasons I do not want you to
ever think that if you feel there's
something wrong with you that you should
go and get it changed or whatever this
is just me being honest about a decision
that I made but I'm not trying to
convince you at all to go and look into
your cosmetic enhancements because I'm
sure you are more than beautiful and
don't need it so please please please do
not think that I'm trying to preach
positivity about cosmetic enhancements
because that's not it at all so I'd like
to explain to you why did this my whole
experience with it I've loved the whole
journey in process this is a really raw
and honest lip augmentation story
there's no you know fancy cover ups
whatever I'll show you when I'm bruised
when I'm swollen when I look terrible I
can see all that kind of stuff coming up
I did get my lips on it a week ago today
and I have overdrawn my lips today as I
normally do so without makeup on they
are a lot smaller than this I just like
to draw my lips because we on earth like
trend going on right now and I just
enjoy the way my lips look when I ever
draw them so if you're new to my channel
you may be unaware of this but my lips
were always my biggest insecurity and
that's why I never
looked at the camera straight like I'm
doing today I literally would never look
straight at the camera because I hated
my lips it kind of clicked in my head
that I wanted to go ahead with this when
I started realizing that my behavior was
changing because of how insecure I was
of like my mouth and my lips that my
behavior because of the subconscious
insecurities was being impacted from it
so I kind of clicked in my head when I
realized whenever I was in a group
setting or sitting around people those
really nervous to be around the one
thing I would do was always sit like
this which is just bizarre isn't it like
I used to always see like that around
people that I was really nervous
throughout because I don't want them I
thought they look a bit like oh my god
it looks a terrible which is just really
good as we you know we all have
insecurities so when I started to
realize that my behavior was like going
really weird because of my lips and then
half my photos I'm covering my lips is
my hair I always sort of cover it with
my phone and we're short like all this I
always did anything to cover them up but
I didn't actually realize I was doing
that that's the we think it's not like I
take a photo and be like I need to cover
my mouth I would just do it because I
feel happy when you couldn't see it
which is you know something you can't
control your mind is so focus or
something that you think is a flaw that
you try and hide it in any way that you
can and so often I was sort of joke
around well you have no lives and then
you know people would take me well if
it's actually that much then why don't
you do something about it and I was like
no no no no no no like I'm never going
to do anything like that
um but then here we are I decided to do
it I took some photos where lips before
I went in to my consultation and my
biggest issue was always my top lip it's
a little back story in 2008 I got braces
I had a really really hectic overbite I
had an eight millimeter gap between my
front teeth and my bottom teeth like my
own white was huge and so obviously
because my overbite was so big it
stretched my lips outwards so when my
take up push back and everything from my
orthodontic work my lips would like hung
forward because it was this sort of like
stretchy muscle which is just like
moving all over the place and from any
sort of like top angle view I literally
look like skin and then bottom lip like
it didn't even look like I had a top lip
so all I wanted was proportion I did
one like big massive lips like the crazy
trend that's going on these days I just
won my top lip my bottom lip to be twins
but this isn't like a sponsored video
only thing I pay for myself it was three
hundred and eighty nine dollars I
believe one millimeter one millimeter
one milliliter right anyway so it was
three hundred eighty nine dollars and it
took literally like five minutes ten
minutes it really didn't take long at
all I did not hurt at all for me like it
was like a little prick but it was like
a three out of 10 on the pain scale what
I'm going to do now is shoot you over to
my experience I'm going to show you my
sort of vlog of my journey and when
they're really swirlix I really want to
show you the raw and real experience
that comes from getting with others so
even I was just one milliliter it did
actually take quite a long time I heal
my lips are still livid bruise
underneath this lipstick which twice so
I want to lipstick on today but I want
to show you my experience I hope you
enjoy it and it's very informative for
you I thank you so much for being so
respectful and actually listening to my
reasons it means so much to me that you
haven't just like skip through or
anything like that
so let's get into the vlog and I hope
you enjoy so I'm about to go and get my
lip stuff never thought that I would be
saying that and my biggest issue is the
view of my lips from the top because
it's like damn bi was your top with that
so here's the top view which is what I
hate the most
bottom you side view so I do have quite
little lips it's gonna give us a career
and see if it makes me feel awful so it
happened and they are so swollen right I
got even like I was my math related very
good so they cut the shape of my lips my
lips are completely NARMS that's why I'm
talking so weirdly so it's been about
six hours since I got my lips done um
they're still like so super swollen but
as you can see they have bruised it brie
is quite a lot so we had that for a few
days my mouth looks very purple because
I have to keep putting ice on it and
everything I just can't stop like
looking in
suctions of being like what are these
like what did these come from
I'm just really hoping but it's gonna go
down a bit because it's bruising it's
not that pretty
I let you just work out and they're so
swollen holy moley got the opening
ceremony I'll see them pick so that's
what the noise is but I feel like this
so swollen right now but it's only the
first day afterwards and she did say
there'd be the most swollen Shay but
they will go down but they're just like
really really sore and so now I
definitely do not like this size oh my
god I live just woke up with a scar
everywhere hopefully don't like this
size so I know that if I ever go back to
get them redone I never want them to be
this big naturally because I don't think
it's easy very much so be everyone it's
a few hours later now the first time in
my life I've actually under drawn my
lips so my lip line is like up there but
I've actually gone underneath it which
is so wigs Lego so over it they actually
look so much more proportion and a lot
more like my older lips now but just
fuller I guess but with that makeup on
they look like a disaster they're Bruzzi
they're like swollen so yeah quite like
it with the red lipstick on but of
course I did only get them done
yesterday so they are very puffy still I
can't find a hairbrush just I'm sorry
about my hair I'm going to shoot back to
my parents house for a little bit to get
some stuff for the apartment but just
wanted to update you on this because
they look pretty good with makeup on I
think it's gonna be smaller than this
but yeah they look better than they used
to god special hello everyone I was look
so glamorous in these vlogs I don't know
why I only do it when I wake up it's
really weird but here is day we it's
Sunday and I got the done on Friday they
are so much less swollen now so don't
have that like real big duck lip going
on anymore I'm quite bruised
um didn't realize I Bruce so easily on
this but I feel like they are so much
nicer like this than they were when they
were like swollen so I went out last
night and I did drink I'm pretty sure
the one who did my lips told me I
shouldn't drink I'm trying to stay super
hydration so it's very important to
hydrate
very things as bruising as kind of ugly
if the bruising was not here
they were look really cool but I'm so
happy with them I dunno they're still
gonna go down a little bit which I'm
feeling like so much happier with them
this shape that is so much more like
proportional what's the best word for it
they're like similar size now I mean
ideally I would want it to be a little
bit flatter on my face but that will
come in time so I'm very happy about it
all I don't hurt as much today yesterday
they were quite bruised and swollen and
they felt like big balloons I could feel
like the filler in them and I just felt
very odd and I went out last night I put
on dark lipstick and I could just tell
people working with it what kind of like
different about it okay but I've gone
down so much today so I won't look so
ridiculous
today but I'm feeling very happy hello
everyone I have a full face of makeup on
and I feel like it looks great with the
loose and I'm super happy that they've
no not as well I feel like it looks so
much nicer now yeah so happy yeah
everyone edges oh my gosh everyone it's
now the next day it is my lip update so
they're not a swollen anymore every
single day they're going down a little
bit but they are actually super boost
and if my lipstick which is why I should
wear hips and lipstick this week um yeah
I think they're looking very natural now
which is good so far they look pretty
good
I'm pretty natural so I'm happy with
so right now it has been one week since
I got my lips done
so they are still slightly swollen they
are definitely still bruised a little
bit but it will go down so please know
that the next to do is next week I
filmed earlier in the week when my lips
were more small and so I'm going to look
ridiculous in these videos but it really
means a lot to me that you watch this
you've heard my reasons and thank you so
much for being so respectful honestly
you're the best and I can't thank you
enough so if you have an amazing day and
I'll see you all very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
