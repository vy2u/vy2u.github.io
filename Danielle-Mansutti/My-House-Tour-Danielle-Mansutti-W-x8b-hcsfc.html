nice so I just have a few little things
sort of around like picture frames I
also have some books little things I've
got beans toys so it's very cozy and
very homely

dining room I really like how there's a
lot of wood and a little wire like all

sentence and this mirror came with my
property and it is today oh boy it's
beautiful

kitchens designed I think it's really
cool really sleek but still got a lot of
like character within it as well and I

difference and then up the stairs we

bathtub and then I've got a few little
decorations dotted around as well and a
lot of jell-o and then this is my spare
room which hasn't really been properly
furnished but it's still enough to sleep
guests comfortably and then through my
hallway is my virtue aims to wear my
