welcome to my lazy day routine which
does consist of a lot of sleeping I'm
also going to be showing you some fun
stuff like Kelso TV plus we're going to
be having a lazy stay together and I'm
so excited it was a really rainy
miserable kind of day so I was more than
happy to stay in bed for a while and
have some pug love and cuddles with my
little beanie and then I finally get up
and make my bed before arranging the
comp these clothes I can find for a few
more hours so I have my own a black put
it back on the rack hoodie you can get
that on Danny bTW calm and of course
wearing it with black legging what else
black on black I mean come on who are we
talking about yeah now it's time to get
nice and clean in the shower I used to
be a night shower person but I'm finding
I'm becoming a morning shower person I
just feel like it makes me so fresh and
clean and happy in the morning I love it
it was seriously such a dark and
miserable morning but I had put my
lights on which is really real I hardly
ever have to do that and we're in the
middle of summer in Melbourne which is
very weird so this is my favorite
breakfast for this kind of day so I'm
going to measure out 40 grams of oats
and then I add approximately one cup of
almond milk and then I put it in the
microwave for two minutes
Wow that is cooking I am going to let a
candle this is the cactus blossom candle
from Bath and Body Works and this is bad
box of Oreos I love it I love it so much
and of course adding honey to my oats
because for its without honey is like
Olivia and mentioned Telstra TB plus it
is a free mobile app but anyone can
download and you can redeem offers as
well as explore and discover content I
am at Ultra TV customer and you can use
this app as a remote for your Telstra TV
it's just the coolest thing ever I
absolutely love it so I just browsing
for a long time through the huge
selection to kind of inspire me about
what for watch today on a lazy day I
just love to get comfy have some nice
food and watch TV or movies and this is
off establish that year and redeem a
huge number and detainment offers if you
are a Telstra mobile
depending on your Telstra contract only
my favorite thing about this app is the
Universal Search I am very indecisive
when it comes to watching movies and
what's amazing about the tap it
literally has everything
ITEA cries my favorite show they had
that I was like hmm what they have ten
things I heard about you tap an old
movie and they did so I was super
impressed and I just used my phone as a
remote and just like magic it is on my
TV so be sure to check out my
description for extra info on Telstra TV
plus and now it's time to get super
comfy eat my food and watch 10 Things I
Hate About You
I haven't watch this movie in forever
and I miss you so much and I was getting
the biggest puppy-dog eyes from beans
even though I actually just fed her
breakfast off camera right before their
shoes like can I have some more now that
the movie has finished it's time to
clean up
I find cleaning up really therapeutic
and I always do it listening to music so
I'm always dancing when I'm cleaning up
since putting away all my dirty dishes
from the night before and it really does
clear my mind I find that it really is
very icky just helps heat and I don't
think I have more perfect mug than this
one today so I've been loving green tea
recently I just drink green tea other
English breakfast which is unheard of
for me so I'm just going to pour a nice
green tea and then I'm going to do a
little bit editing in emails because I
don't get the day off with my job so I
was going to ensure that I've done a
little bit of work for the day so I feel
a little bit productive and write down
my goals and to-do list for the rest of
the day but I was feeling super tired
and definitely need to brush my teeth
because I had my porridge breath so I
was trying to brush my teeth and you
know what I really think it's time to
just go ahead and get back into bed so I
hope you guys enjoyed my lazy day
routine I love you so much and have a
great day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
