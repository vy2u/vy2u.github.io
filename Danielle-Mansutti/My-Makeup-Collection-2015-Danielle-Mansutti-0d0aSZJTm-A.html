channel today I'm doing my makeup
collection which is super exciting for
me because I've never really shown you
guys into my little drawers before I
would just like to start by saying that
I'm so lucky to have the makeup that I
have the majority of the makeup that you
see in this video is stuff that I fought
with my well and money and I have grown
my collection so much since this time
last year although a lot of you may
think that this collection is quite
embarrassing compared to other youtubers
that's fine I love my little collection
I may not have as much as other
youtubers but I still have a lot and I'm
just so lucky to have what I have
let's be real guys you don't want to
hear me talking you want to see what I
have so I'm gonna jump straight into it
now I really hope that you enjoy my
collection wait so hear how my drawers a
look from the front and then I have this
little thing going on at the top most of
my stuff is sorry my tripod is horrible
most of my stuff is in this drawer here
it's from Ikea and I'll leave all the
link for that stuff below I will firstly
start by showing you what's in the box
down here um that is my underwear drawer
so this is just the my only little bad
boy here so this is the top drawer this
is where I keep my bronzers blushes and
my extra things over here pressed
powders and highlighters so this is all
of my highlighters blushes and bronzers
and you guys know that I have favorites
in years so you guys know I love the Too
Faced bronzes I absolutely love the
hoola bronzer um so I have some benefit
stuff here take my stuff and I have a
NYX blush a1 makeup store blush this is
the only makeup store thing that I own
and then this
is my absolute lifesaver it's the
Australis
fresh and flawless pressed powder this
stuff is amazing guys I love it so much
then I have some other powders over here
like the Rimmel stay matte powder the
Australis pressed powder which I really
don't like me more and then I have these
benefit high beam and some being
highlighters which I just cannot seem to
get to work for me so I don't know I
just no matter what I do these just do
not work for me so hopefully you guys
can help me with that one then hiding at
the back we have the bomb how about them
apples palette with this gorgeous little
puggy on the front cover which is
incredible um then underneath those
pallets I've got three pairs of
eyelashes and some glue from ardell or
Adele oh god and then hiding up here I
have my Mac Studio Fix powder I've had
this for so long and I don't really use
it anymore because it's the wrong shade
it's NW 25 which is my old shade before
I discovered fake tan then I have my
love of my life the Mac soft and gentle
highlighter you guys know how much I
love this so this sits at the back of
every minute spot and then finally I
have an Urban Decay Naked illuminated
highlighter and it's really gorgeous
color and then in the second drawer we
have mascara we have pencil eyeliners
some more eyeliners liquid eyeliners
some brow pencils and then my favorite
brow products so in here I keep a range
of more high-end mascara like the Too
Faced better than sex one I keep my
lower lash in here and then I have like
various ones like essence and Rimmel and
a lot kind of stuff they all sit over in
here and I have a really bad habit of
opening mascaras and then not using them
and then they go off and over here
my new favorite product of all time
which is the NYX milk jumbo eye pencil
this was all over YouTube and I decided
to give it a go and I loved it and then
in here I just have a few Rimmel
scandaleyes all the big thick I'll and
as I keep in here which I haven't opened
yet so we don't open it um then I have
my liquid eyeliners then over here in
the brow pencil part I have a sharpener
I have the benefit browsing and then I
have my old little chichi eye pencils
which used to be in my life and then I
have the benefit high brow which I
haven't used yet and then over here
hiding in the corner is my good eye brow
section um when I was blond is used the
Mac fluidline brow gel cream in dirty
blonde because that was my old eyebrow
color but I still keep it in there just
in case I go blonde again then I have
two extras of the Anastasi of beverly
hills dipbrow because be anybody takes
so long to send them so I decided that I
would just buy extras because I can't
bother waiting like two months for them
to deliver and then I have my current
dip brow which is so dry that it's just
like no and then over in this one out we
just have a whole heap of pencil
eyeliners I don't really use pencil
eyeliners so it's a shame that I have so
many that aren't being use but I have a
lot of the I've Horace ones I have
chichi ones and real ones over here so
all very affordable eyeliners sitting
over there this is my foundation drawers
I keep it in little sections so over
here I keep my drugstore foundations
over here I have some primers and then
the benefit Porefessional stuff and then
some covergirl foundation then at the
very front if you can see I have my
concealers my contour kit and some BB
creams and then in the middle are my
high-end foundation so I are in about
three high-end foundations as you guys
know I have the Estee Lauder one the Mac
Studio Fix and recently I got color
matched to this Mac Studio Fix but it's
like super yellow on my skin so it's
kind of annoying it was NC 42 but it's
just so dark for me so I don't know why
like I was thinking my fake 10 must have
been pretty dark that day and in the
middle I have these Urban Decay
foundation powder thin guys which I
haven't had a go with yep I want to try
these really bad and hiding at the back
I have this Too Faced foundation powder
I'm not a big fan of foundation powders
hence why I haven't tried them yet but
I've got to give everything a go so with
my concealers so I have an elf concealer
I have the super state 24 hour concealer
my Rimmel wake me up concealer I have
some Urban Decay Naked skin concealer
then I have this Michelle Phan one and
this covergirl one as well and then I
have the BB creams there for my
foundations I have the L'Oreal
infallible L'Oreal Lumi magique L'Oreal
True Match the chichi one the covergirl
three and one and then some spares and
over here I have the covergirl ones to
Rimmel primers so this is my face drawer
this is my favorite draw to look at
though because it's so colorful and
beautiful it is mainly drugstore though
I can't really afford to buy many
high-end foundations but the next thing
I'm having to buy is the NARS sheer glow
so hopefully I'll make this little
section I think bigger in the future so
I believe there was a stock sitting in
the frame somewhat over here sorry about
that I just moved it and noticed so in
the last drawer I have to show you guys
this is my palette drawer so this is my
favorite thing you guys know that
eyeshadows are my favorite makeup thing
and why over lipsticks and what kind of
stuff and in this drawer I have my Too
Faced semi-sweet and chocolate bar
palette I have my Urban Decay Naked 3
palette I also have the stealer in the
light palette a little tiny baby Naked 2
palette and then I have some various
color pop ones sitting at the bottom
I also keep my necks shimmery things in
there and then on the side I keep my
sleek palettes and then I believe these
are the chanak so color pop eyeshadows
except mine just says super shock but
I'm pretty sure on the other ones it
says show neck so I could be completely
wrong and then I have the mother of all
palettes at the back which is my more
fees warm palette you guys know how much
I'm in love with this palette that's it
over there the back and that is all my
eye shadows this little skeleton that
plant pot thing is from Kmart it only
cost like $10 I don't really know why I
love it so much but I think it's
gorgeous
these lipstick holders are also from
Kmart they are like five dollars I think
and also as you can see at the back this
lipstick holder was also from Kmart so
firstly I'll grab what's on the top of
the shelf so as you guys know I did a
Too Faced melted metal lipstick swatch
not long ago and then I also have
another lipstick holder here so I have
some of the melted metal lipsticks here
and then I have just the normal ones in
the middle over here I have a bomb
lipstick I have an urban decay lipstick
- Michelle Phan lipsticks a Georgia
Romani one and a glamorous little lime
crime lipstick which can go on the bin
to be honest just kidding I've tried a
lot of money for that stuff and then
over here I have four max lipsticks so I
do around the own for MAC lipsticks and
I'm quite happy with that because I love
them all very much so I also have two
colour-pop lippie well they got lippy
sticks over here as well and with the
lipsticks I have a velvet a teddy which
is my favorite lipstick of all time and
I have cider which is this big dark
lipstick here I use it for my music
festival tutorial and I have brave which
is running a bit low Brice is this color
and it's got a really weird shape at the
top as well and then finally I have
lady a danger which is this gorgeous
cool turned red let's be honest most of
us can only afford for MAC lipsticks
over in the draw section of my top
drawer is full of chichi lipstick and I
just keep it in color order because I'm
crazy like that and then I have some
more chichi lipstick and chichi lip
glosses no the second one which isn't
really all that exciting and then at the
very bottom of my drawers I have some
waiting for well okay this isn't gonna
happen
but I have some extra stuff in there
which really isn't that great
and then in here is where I keep my
thank-you cards because I you guys know
I write back to people who write stuff
to my peer box I keep my thank-you cards
in this drawer with my stamps and all
that kind of stuff so that's just easy
rich place in this drawer I have my
Rimmel pravakar lips lip glosses our
lipsticks whatever you want to call them
these are absolutely incredible they
last so long but they're so hard to get
off some of you might remember I did a
swatch video on this eight years ago but
I'm still absolutely love these
lipsticks they're just the best and then
on the very bottom drawer I just have
some covergirl lip glosses and NYX lip
gloss
the Benetint and the funny bomb as well
with my perfumes right here I have these
chichi perfumes which honestly guys are
incredible my favorite one is the
frangipani one and the peach mango one
is just as amazing and then over here I
have these very very empty Juicy Couture
perfumes and this was like my go-to one
at school I used to just be obsessed
with this one at the very top I have my
current absolute obsession I use my
morning routine and you guys know that
look how much I've used hardly anything
because I try and save it as much as I
can this is the Viktor and Rolf bonbon
perfume and my goodness it smells
incredible Oh seriously
I'm a
zing and then finally I have these
chichi pellets these metal things were
from Officeworks I went to expensive or
anything like that
