collection for 2016 now looking at the
top of my desk and I keep three acrylic
drawers up here with my must-have makeup

Mac goal deposit Mac Studio Fix we have
Becca champagne pop NARS Laguna the bomb

I also keep my contour kit in here but I
don't really use it so admin in the
third row I keep my mascaras and
eyeliners and also my eyelash glue so I
just keep all my favorite mascaras and
eyeliners on the top here because I
don't want to open too many mascaras at
once as you can see I have five open and
that's ridiculous and then I keep all my
eyeliners Urban Decay it cosmetics
I have Horus etc etc in there as well
the next Roy are my daily go-to

singles in here as well so I have a
stealer palette a Mac palette a Kat Von
D eyeshadow urban decay eyeshadow a Mac
eye shadow and then I keep some Inglot
eyeliner gels and another in glock
pigment not too sure while it's in there
but it is it lives there so don't really
know I don't ever use it it's kind of
weird anyway moving on we have my makeup
geek splash Anastacio Beverly Hills eyes

Anastasia and makeup geek single shadows

on the bottom drawer I keep my face
makeup so I normally wear my NARS sheer
glow or my Make Up For Ever HD
foundation I also keep the Too Faced
hangover primer and my it cosmetics
concealers in this drawer as well
moving a slowly down to the next acrylic
drawers I actually keep a lot of color
pop shadows on the top of my drawer this
was a Christmas collection and I've just
been using them so often so I just put
them in an easy-to-reach place I really
really love colorful oh so good and then
in the top drawer I keep the Anastasio
Beverly Hills lip glosses in the second
drawer I just have three colourpop ultra
matte lips and then in the third drawer
I have a few more color pop jeffree star

jarred cosmetics in there's some mac
lipglass and some chichi lip liners and
then in the very bottom one I keep
jewelry and moving on to the little tiny
drawer I have the stealer lip glazes and
then I also keep my brow stuff in here
so Anastacio stuff Mac fluidline brow
gel cream and also my Sigma powder too
and some brow Wiz is blue now we're
moving on to my drawers where all the
magic happens
in here in the top drawer I keep my
favorite foundations so I have my
favorite drugstore my favorite high-end
and also I have this cream Anastasio
contour kit which I'm so scared to use I
really just need to use it so I'm
pushing myself I putting it in my
favorite drawer to use it so I have a
lot of Born This Way Foundation and then
I also have quite a bit of SL double
where Mac Studio Fix fluid which I have
used so long and there's some more
makeup forever in the second drawer we
have concealers blushes bronzers
highlights primers and powders I'm very
glad I can open it into the wine drawer
and that I'm not hoarding just a
ridiculous of now it is a ridiculous
amount still but you know what I mean so
I keep all my blushes and bronzers and
highlights in the back section and then
in the front section we have my
concealers and my powder
this next rule is looking a little bit
sad it is a little bit emptier than the
rest this is where I store all my false
lashes
this droid is like what look at all that
bag tag I think I'm just a little bit
obsessed with one day sans and loving
tan what do you think just a little bit
yeah
and then in the big bottom drawer I like
to keep my eyeshadow palettes which I
don't usually use that much but I want
to sort of use more you know what I mean
I keep my morphe brushes parts in here
which I do actually use a lot but
they're so big I had to just stuff them
in here my Too Faced natural matte a
Sigma palette the Urban Decay electric
one the Urban Decay vice palettes and
hiding at the back we also have some Zoe
the palettes as well so these are our
palettes that I haven't really used yet
and I want to use more and then in the
top drawer on the right side on my
favorite palettes the ones I am in love
with we have all the naked palettes we
also keep the Too Faced chocolate bar
palette and the love palette by Too

eyes toothpaste part which I love then I
keep the Anastasia Beverly Hills
palettes in there stealer palette lorac
pro and some Mac's little pallets well
going down one more drawer we have all
my eyeliners mascaras and remaining brow
product I have a lot of mascara and I
don't want to just open it and use it
once I'm just saving it for a rainy day
and then I keep all my brow stuff in the
little pink drawer hiding behind it then
I have my liquid liners and also my
pencil liners at the back so this next
drawer is like my weird drawer I think
we all have this I keep random stuff in
here I have baby wipes Europe and pens
and makeup pads yeah okay then moving
swiftly ahead in this next drawer I keep
my extras so I have extra Too Faced
bronzers extra foundations I also keep
my BB creams in here and my Too Faced
Born This Way Foundation which I have
use so it's a bit unhygenic to just give
them to someone else and I have a lot of
drugstore foundations which is sort of
on their last legs and I need to hurry
up and use them ASAP
then in the bottom we have color pop
eyeshadows and drugstore lipsticks these
are all of my lipsticks so I have all
these color pop singles which is so
gorgeous but I have a mix of L'Oreal and
Maybelline lipsticks at the bottom I
also have chichi lipsticks and then at
the back we just have remaining random
lipsticks
and that is my entire makeup collection

the difference from last time and I will
see you guys really really soon thanks
