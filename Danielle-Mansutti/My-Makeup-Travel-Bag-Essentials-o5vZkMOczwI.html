and welcome to my new filming setup I'm
so excited to show you guys I have been
building furniture for days and like
setting up all these like pretty very
nuts and stuff but I hope you guys
really like this new film and sell
everything but it's really cute and
really mean and colorful and yes today's
video is all about what is in my travel
makeup bag that side looks a bit nice
with it so as you guys know I've been
doing a lot of traveling recently I
recently got back from LA as well and
thought it might well show you what I
pack when I go traveling in my makeup
bag because I feel like you'll see my
essentials my must-have traveling as
well and lisas sort of like my favorite
products whole time so it's like a
favorites and an organization video all
in one I've never filmed any sort of
like what's in my bag whats in my makeup
bag I think before so why not do it
what's in my travel makeup bag and let's
jump straight into it so here is my big
bag which I love T's to store all my
makeup and all my brushes the bit
obvious that I take just a little bit
too much makeup around with me when I
travel but this big to face bag is just
absolutely perfect for it so inside the
bag I have two compartments I have a
compartment with a zip which I like to
keep all my brushes and loose items in
and then on the other side we have or
just a secure area which is zipped and I
like to keep the majority of my makeup
in here and I like the fact that I can
just zip it up and then zip it up again
and it's born that's a hand secure so
when I pack my bags I like to be super
organized and get everything out on the
table so that I can see it I think the
biggest thing to do when you're packing
for makeup is to start from your base
and actually think of all the products
you use from the start to the end and
that will help you so much with packing
your bags I will start with my primer
and at the moment I'm loving the Too
Faced hangover primer I find that it is
so hydrating especially when you're
traveling I don't know about you guys my
skin gets slower dry when I'm traveling
so after primer comes foundation so I
get at my favorite foundation at the
moment I think it's really important
whilst traveling to go with a foundation
that you know works well for you and you
know that you love continuing with my
face makeup the next thing that I use
when I apply my makeup everyday is
concealer so I'm taking a consider that
I know works very well for me which is
the Rimmel wake me up concealer for me
what comes next is my powder and my
absolute go to powder as I'm sure many
of you know is my NARS pressed powder
I've been using this powder now for
quite some time I've actually hit the
pan
unfortunately I love it so so so much
and then the next thing I think about is
my eyes the most important thing is
brows when it comes to my eyes so I like
to take my Anastasia Beverly Hills dip
brow pomade and then continuing on with
my eye brows I also like to take my
clear brow gel with me
the next thing that I like to pick out
is my current favorite mascara I've been
loving the Maybelline lash sensational
because I used to have a really love
hate relationship with it but then I
took it to LA and I used it on every
single day in LA and just fell in love
with it again gonna take one mascara
with me because I just feel if you run
out you can always buy them tinning with
eyes I always like to take a eyeliner
with me just in case there's any nights
that we go out and want to look a little
bit more glam and this island is the
covergirl intensify me liner I only like
to take around 2 eyeshadows so this is
the Kat Von D raw power I shadow I like
to take this one because I can make a
lot of different looks with it it is
just such a gorgeous color and I feel
like just putting a tiny bit on your
crease works well and then applying it
around your entire eye and your lower
lash line works really well as well and
I also like to take a gold shimmer
because you know how him with Michael
Simmons guys I love the color pop and
mace super shock shadow and I think it's
perfect as well because it's so tiny the
makeup is absolutely sipping and sliding
everywhere so sorry that it keeps moving
so then I move on to other things that I
might need for my face as well and when
it comes to contouring I actually like
to just take a bronzer instead of taking
a whole contour kit because contour kits
are just so heavy and so bulky that
they're not very good for travel at all
so when it does come to traveling I like
to just contour with a bronzer and I
love the balm Bahama Mama bronzer
because it is sort of so tiny as well as
the hot mama bronzer from the barn I
feel like these are perfect for
traveling because they're just so small
and the bronzer works so well for my con
as well I absolutely love them and then
of course we all need a bit of highlight
and otherwise I take the Jacqueline Hill
champagne pop around everywhere with me
now because I've absolutely fall in love
with it late on the bandwagon as always
the last part of my makeup routine is
always my lips so make sure to take a
natural lip liner with me and then like
to take a natural lipstick with me
my favorite natural lipstick at the
moment is modesty by Mac I feel like it
really hydrates my lips which is really
rare because Mac nolle makes my lips
feel so dry and then the last thing that
I take is a more dramatic lip product
feel like when you're traveling you
should always take something a little
bit different quite glam just in case
you do go out for dinner or go out to
something really cool it's always nice
to have something quite bold and out
there in your makeup kit because if you
just have all natural makeup it can get
a little bit boring after a while so
then I just make sure to pack all my
makeup in the right place and make sure
that it will all be quite secure for
when we are traveling and then once all
my makeup is packed I like to just put
over this little flap here and we zip up
to this side so when it comes to it
brushes I always think less is more when
it comes to packing especially so when I
come to do my eye brushes I always make
sure and they have about three or four
brushes so I have a smaller brush which
is more for my application on my lid
then I have a big fluffy brush for
blending then I have a diffused crease
brush which I use for my crease and then
I just use those three and I somehow get
away with doing like smokey eyes natural
eyes and a lot kind of stuff with just
three brushes and then when it comes to
my eyebrows my favorite eyebrow brush is
the dual ended brow brush and this is
because it's two brushes and one which
is also so perfect for traveling so
these are just the main brushes that I
like to take for traveling and then I
just store them in the little zip part
here the best thing that you can have is
a view blender I know mine is looking
pretty gross and I do apologize for that
but I've been trying to tag it with
shampoo to clean it but it is just not
working so I do like to take my blender
every with me because I feel like it is
just so
for foundation concealer for blending
it's just you know a master of all
trades they only take two more brushes
and the reason for this is that I feel
like I can get a lot of use out of just
these two the first one I have is an
Estee Lauder powder brush which is just
my absolute Holy Grail powder brush and
lastly I have a morphe mv8 brush i
actually uses for my bronzer and my
blush i've used it today so that is why
it's looking a little bit gross what i
want to do it with a contour i hold it
on its side i use the flat side when i
want it as a blush i use the round side
and then what i want to use it as a
highlight i just literally put on the
very very very end and I do feel like
less is more
for brushes in particular because I just
don't want to have too many with me be
carrying around too much and then we
will just close the bag and that is also
cure and ready for traveling so hope
that you guys enjoyed seeing how I pack
my makeup for traveling and what I like
to take with me please leave any
requests in the comments for future
videos and up chatty guys on Friday bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
