intro so this is just me getting up in
the morning I've got my beautiful little
doggie always next to me when I wake up
and I'm just gonna put all my glasses
cuz I'm blind as a bat and this is where
I just threw my phone in the morning so
I get on my phone I just like to check
my Twitter I just check out my social
media pages I also check my Instagram go
through my feed catch up and everything
that I missed out when I was asleep and
check my facebook page I also like to go
through my tumblr messages and finally
go through my subscription book so now
it's time to get out of bed and stay I'm
wearing my beautiful pug dogs I hope you
guys love them they're so cute and I
normally just leave the bedroom and this
one isn't very happy about it I'm just
popping on a hoodie this morning because
I was freezing and I'm just going to
make my way to the bathroom
so I await contact lenses for my vision
and this is only when I put them in in
the morning and it is pretty disgusting
sorry
Freddy goes then I just put my hair up
into a bun just so I can wash my face
without any hairs all over my face I'm
just going to brush my teeth so that I
don't have stinky morning breath and I
like to just have a bit of a jig while
I'm brushing my teeth now I'm just going
to quickly it wash my face it just makes
me wake up in the morning and feel more
refreshed and I normally shower at
nighttime but sometimes in the morning I
feel a bit yucky so I decided today I
would shower in the morning now it's the
best time of the day and that's
breakfast time whew so I'm just walking
into the kitchen washing my hands and
I'm gonna try and find something young
to eat in the pantry
I like to put some music on just while
I'm making my breakfast and as you can
see I was a little bit excited about
eating today this is my current
obsession I have been loving having tuna
Mayo and tomato for breakfast it looks
so gross but it tastes so good so I just
amp this all into a bowl mix it together
then I like to add a little bit of
mayonnaise and I'm just gonna chop up a
tomato and add that into the tuna and if
Coco is lucky enough she gets a little
treat I am obsessed with vinegar so of
course I put on some balsamic vinegar
just to give the tuna a bit of a tang
and then I mix it all together and this
is me trying to prove to you that it
actually tastes good
I love to eat outside on the balcony in
the mornings so I'm just making my way
outside and I've just got my laptop just
to check through some emails and all
that stuff it was a little bit too windy
outside on this day so I decided to come
inside and just reply to my YouTube
comments and just catch up with you guys
this is my favorite time of the day to
watch my subscriptions I will sit here
for hours and just go through so so is
there so many of your YouTube videos now
it's time for me to get ready and I'm
off downstairs with a little follower
and I'm just downstairs at my desk I
have to light candles I'm obsessed with
them at the moment so yeah then I just
go over to SoundCloud and I just get
some music on for when I'm getting ready
and today I was using the L'Oreal Lumi
magique
Foundation and I'm using the Real
Techniques buffing brush just to apply
this all over my skin
I'm just contouring as always with the
AC onto a contour kit just on my cheek
bones and I also like to do it in the
hoods of my eyes and using the instant
age rewind I'm just popping this
underneath my eyes to make myself a
little bit more awake and ready for the
day
now we're playing my favorite lipstick
which is velvet teddy by Mac and just
popping this on my lips just to finish
off the look i usually party your
letters in the morning so everyone who
writes letters to my PA box you always
get a little pack from me and I'm just
writing back to some letters weird and
throw them making sure I didn't make any
embarrassing spelling mistakes and I'm
just going off to post that shortly just
going to put on my favorite perfume
which is bonbon by Viktor and Rolf it is
so good and you guys have asked a lot
about a fitness routine or anything like
that but just right now I'm using this
app it's called pump up and it's like a
social media app it's sort of like
Instagram meets My Fitness Pal it is
just like a motivational app which I've
been using and yeah so you can just log
your activity it gives you like personal
training tips or the workouts it's just
like a social media and a personal
trainer in one so here I'm just setting
my workout for the day I was only gonna
do about 20-30 minutes and I just wanted
to target my core because who doesn't
want someone sexy abs
so it's just building a little workout
for me I was just going to go out with a
dog and then do these exercises which it
demonstrates for you on the app so I've
just got my bottle of water and I'm
getting ready to go for a run with cokes
and I'm just putting on my shoes I
decided that update with a photo on the
app but do you guys know how hard it is
to take a photo of your dog it's just
impossible and she wouldn't want to
comply with me so I'm just popping a
photo on the pump up app because we're
gonna go for a little walk and I thought
it was cute little photo and we're off
at the door and ready to start the day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
