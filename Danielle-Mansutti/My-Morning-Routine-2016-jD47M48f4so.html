goes off at 7:30 in the morning around
the time it gets light naturally and
give me enough time to stalk social
media but first it is time to give Coco
some cuddles because isn't she just the
cutest thing who hold I love her so so
much and then it's time to stalk social
media for a ridiculously long time in
the morning and I'm not satisfied unless
I go through like my whole Instagram
feed and catch up on everything that I
missed when I was asleep
doesn't anyone else do that and then I
head over to my tagged photos and have a
look to see if you guys made anything
cute for me because I love that so much
and then I move over to snapchat have a
look at things that I missed whilst I
was asleep and then finally I go on to
Twitter and you guys know I loved was so
much for interacting with you it's just
the best
and then I have a quick look at my
subscriptions and I tend to like videos
before I even watch them does anyone
else do that but anyway it is time to
make my bed so I'm sure you guys all
know how to do this I'm just going to
fluff up my pillows and make my bed
of course Koko thought it meant she
could sit on it again even though I
wasn't even done making it but that's
what you get when you're a spoilt little
Labrador moving on to a breakfast I was
making a protein smoothie this morning
and decided to make it into a smoothie
Bowl so as you can see I'm using
blueberries raspberries and protein
powder as well so I'm just adding a few
blueberries two scoops of my protein
powder a lot of raspberries when I had
to open a new blueberry packet and added
some more as well my fingers oh my
goodness and then I just add the almond
milk on top
now sometimes I like to eat it out of a
bowl with fruit so I just poured my
smoothie into a bowl and then I grabbed
a banana and a Kiwi and started to cut
those up
you
and then I just add the fruit to the
little smoothie bowl and I'm going to
head upstairs and start catching up on
some YouTube videos while I eat my
breakfast so this is my little desk here
if I'm doing a skincare morning this is
where my skincare sits and my makeup is
on my right and then I like to just sit
down with my breakfast and catch up on
some YouTube videos
I also like to use this time to reply to
comments reply to emails and I was sorry
I because crystal added a new bloopers
video today and it was hilarious I loved
it so much and then afterwards it's time
to brush my teeth I do not shower in the
morning I man out over whatever what I
am a night to shower in and then I go
back in my room put on some music my
favorite song right now is it's strange
I love it so much you can find it on my
Spotify I just light a candle because
you know set in the mood and then I get
ready to put on my makeup so I just grab
a few products that I'll use for the day
and set them out in front of me
it is Minnie Mouse head pen time I'm
starting with the CLO one step correct
primer and then I'm using the NARS sheer
glow foundation in Barcelona would
anyone be interested in seeing an
updated everyday makeup routine because
I will be more than happy to make one I
kind of feel like my old ones outdated
so if you would like to see that then
please let me know I am applying a
little bit of powder underneath my eyes
to avoid creasing then filling in my
eyebrows with a deep dark brunette
fluidline brow gel cream by Mac then I'm
adding a little bit of mascara and then
after the mascara I'm going to go in
with that hoola bronzer that you saw
before on my cheeks I'm just keeping it
so simple today not using too many
products and then after I do my cheeks I
apply a little bit of lip liner and that
is all the products that I'm using today
now I use this time to just double-check
what I'm doing for the day my diary is
blank and this because I didn't want to
spoil anything for you guys for things
that I'm doing so I just get that ready
see what I'm doing see how busy I am and
then choose what outfit to wear for the
day and as you can see Coco is the
lazy's Labrador in the world so it's
just time to wake her up before her
morning walk and today I decided just go
with a very simple white tee and
leggings so comfortable and then we're
going to start heading out the door and
getting ready for our morning walk
so I just want to say thank you for
watching my morning routine today I'm
more than happy to do more routines in
the future so don't forget to subscribe
and I'll see you guys really soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
