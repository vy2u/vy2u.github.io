mental health addition morph the really
tough warnings were is pretty much
impossible to get out of bed these are a
few things that I do that help me be
productive throughout the day firstly
I'm going to put my mental health first
and if I feel like I need more sleep
then I'm gonna go ahead and do just that
and when I do wake up it's so important
to stretch
I find getting out of bed is hard enough
as it is but when you stretch your quad
it feels awake and energized and so much
better so when it comes to my phone if
I'm not having a good day it's the last
thing that I should look at so I'll have
a quick look at my notifications and
then I will switch it off for the next
two hours and do a few self-care things
that'll make me feel a lot better than
looking through to whatever Instagram I
am a strong believer in a clean
environment clean mind so if I'm having
a crappy day the first thing I have to
do is clean up my environment and I'll
make me feel so much better and the most
important thing you can do for yourself
in the morning is to eat even if it's
just like sharees or like this it
doesn't matter as long as you eat
something that's the best thing to do
I've also decided to read on my bad days
instead of looking at my phone and so
many of you have recommended the secret
to me to read and I'm loving it and
recommend it to all of you it's so good
for putting in a positive mind bone and
then look at the Pug love as well
there's honestly nothing better than a
dog or just a pet in general when you're
feeling down
so now he's gonna make a nice warm cup
of tea and then I'm going to light some
candles and I'm going to bathe wash my
hair and just relax
I don't know what it is for me but when
I do my skincare it just makes you feel
so much better and clean and just like
amazing and then I'm gonna apply a coat
effect hand because it always manages to
make me feel so much better about myself
just gonna buff it in with a brush as
well and then I'm feeling nice fresh and
clean
personally I find for escapism I love
playing games some people have to draw
something love to read but for me I just
love playing games it just distracts
people in the world and it just makes me
feel so happy I'm obsessed with call of
duty at the moment and that's completely
fine I just love playing it for maybe
like half an hour and then it's time to
get stuck into work and be a productive
adult and of course don't forget your
order it is very important to stay
hydrated - hi guys I hope you enjoyed
today's video I'm actually got to get to
work to start editing this video I
really jump in here to have a quick
little word before I sign off because I
know it's a struggle to do any of those
things when you're having a bad day and
this is a very productive day for me I
hope this video will give you some
motivation to get up and be productive
and just do something with the day
because I know how easy it is to just
wanna lie better all day and just feel
like funk it up because it is difficult
even just to get out of bed is so
difficult and I completely understand
what that's like for me normally I would
do some work now then I would go for a
walk and I've definitely walked the dog
while I'm doing that I find that walking
for me makes like the world of
difference I know what you know you're
stronger than your bad days we can get
through this together and I can't
exchange</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
