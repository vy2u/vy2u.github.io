night and haircare routine I'm gonna be
sharing with you like all the products
that have been using recently need to
get my hair nice and healthy again and
every single pamper night needs to start
with a bath and I'm so happy I finally
have a buffer getting my new flat and of
course we need to light some candles too
so unfortunately the water pressure is
so slow at my flats that takes a long
time for the baths to fill and in the
meantime I'm just gonna drop a lush
above I'm in there this one is so
gorgeous
and look at this my god I could
literally watch this for hours
I'm gonna be treating my hair to a hair
treatment today and this one is that
lebesgue body prepare me extreme and
this is the mail everyone my hair is
looking all types of greasy today so I
definitely need this and I'm just gonna
put it straight on to dry hair alabang
body sent me a bunch of their hair
treatments recently and I've caused
child and tested the products myself
before providing them to you guys and I
love them and I have now gone through
the entire packet of their original one
it's this is the first time I tried the
Malibu one and I was like damn that
smells so good so I absolutely love the
smell of this I love how makes my hair
feel it just feels like hydrate is the
best way to put it and it's really hard
for me because in England especially in
Brighton its we have a single hard water
so it makes my hair like a lot more dry
so I need this kind of hair mask to make
my hair feel like it did back in
Australia
and after coming through from roots to
tips I'm gonna leave it in for 20
minutes and then I'm going to shampoo it
out
what is the pamper day without a face
mask seriously I'm gonna use this clay
mask from over at and I'm gonna leave it
on my face a whole time but I'm in the
bar I'll stop writing my bath when it is
about three-quarters full so enough so
that it will couple my legs and that it
is time to pick some chilled out music
and sit in the bath and I do check
social meter in the bath but I haven't
actually dropped my phone in the bath
yet so fingers crossed
let's hope I don't jinx myself but I'm
also gonna shave my legs and of course
my armpits and how beautiful was the
glistening order from the bath bomb I
was I prefer to rinse my hair in the
shower just because the bath water is
like dirty and oh my goodness doesn't it
take five million years to get warm I
swear to God
so I'm just going to use a really like
light amount of water to wash my hair
mask out and also wash off my face mask
and I'm gonna use the lebesgue body
shampoo and conditioners and this one is
in the raspberry scent and it is OH
like seriously as I'm recording this
voice over I'm just sniffing my hair
like it smells so good
I'll also reason the conditioner in that
range and I do love it because it is a
repairing shampoo and conditioner range
which is what I need because I have
bleached hair that needs a little bit of
love and a big tick what really sold me
on their range is the fact that it's
free of like parabens SLA SPG's
grapefruit seed extract all that stuff
that if you look after it how you know
you want to avoid those ingredients as
much as you can because they make your
hair so bad so after I tried the
lebesgue products for myself and they
wanted to partner with me I was like
hell yeah because they really do make my
hair amazing I've been using it for
about a month or so and I love them and
I'm now putting on a bit of Oprah or
Wonder lash to my neck and my face
because I always feel a bit dry after a
bath and I'm gonna take my hair out and
start to brush it through before drying
it
so here's how healthy and beautiful my
hair's been looking with Liu bang and
note that I have a little discount code
for you guys it is a love Downey for 15%
off and I'll leave all the other info in
the description box below and I'm just
gonna finish off by using some of their
body oil which I love I'm just gonna use
just the moisturize my body just before
I get into bed and have some nice chew
out snowballs and beans
and then once my body is dry this is the
time of the night where I like to get
into bed have a little bit of like hugs
snuggles free to book the drink some tea
and relax I hope you guys enjoyed my
little pad the night routine I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
