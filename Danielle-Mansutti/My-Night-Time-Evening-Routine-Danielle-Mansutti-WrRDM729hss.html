routine because my morning routine was
so much fun to film tone once I walk up
the stairs with my little doggy I'm just
going to put all my stuff on the table
and then walk straight into my room and
put on some comfy slippers when I got
home there was a beautiful sunsets of
course I got my little snapchat out so
you guys gonna add me from this little
thing I believe anyway if you want to
see some snapshots of sunsets then yeah
feel free to add me
and KOCO had no idea what I was doing
outside so I'm making my way back inside
and into the kitchen to make some tea
so I feel like I have to have a tape
when I get home every day otherwise I
get like headaches which is kind of bad
anyway I normally have a tightly
extra-strong the English breakfast here
it is my life so I'm just going to let
it brew for a few minutes and while I'm
letting it brew I'm just going to put on
some music and have a bit of a jig in
the kitchen
so now it is a computer time I'm going
to be doing emails replying to comments
editing and most likely being distracted
oh and I'm one of those people who is
obsessed candles and this is my favorite
candle ever I believe it's for the Taha
vanilla-caramel candle and oh my god
it's amazing I am obsessed so just going
through your comments on my videos and
just replying through and you guys know
how much I love interacting with you
anyway so I love spending about half an
hour to an hour just replying back to
your comments and then of course
stalking other youtubers so I ended up
on a Christmas channel and my god she is
so gorgeous
so of course I'm being distracted and I
want to read it I spend so long on
reddit it's bizarre
anyway it's back to work time and time
to edit videos and plan videos all this
stuff so obviously I'm just showing you
what I would do but this is all the time
where I plan videos as well which took a
few hours and like make little
storyboards and all that kind of stuff
so as it was a Friday night and I was
home alone I thought I deserved a pizza
I know in this kind of routines people
normally eat like rabbit food really
healthy but I'm going to eat a pizza
because why not
you
so while I'm waiting for the delivery
man to arrive I just turn on the fire
because it's getting into the colder
seasons now in Australia and mr.
delivery man was taking a while so we
were just hanging out and being boring
by the fire so I decided to watch some
TV while I was waiting and just chill
out and as soon as I sat down the
doorbell rang so I'm running up the
stairs and it's finally time for pizza
so of course I had someone staring at me
the whole time but I don't think pizzas
good for a so as you can see she gave up
and she just left me alone
I watch TV I get really distracted and I
always end up on Twitter and I always
end up talking to you guys
so my twitter handle is Danny one city
with two eyes if you want to chat with
me on there and then I was also just
going through snapchat and just keeping
up to date with all you guys
now it's time to get ready for bed and
take off the makeup coming into the
bathroom I'm just going to tie up my
hair and start removing my makeup this
part is so gross Oh false eyelashes
yummy I'm using liya Garnier micellar
cleansing water as always and I'm just
using this on a cotton pad to remove my
makeup and I do this first and then I
will rinse my face afterwards I know
that my skincare routine is a bit
rubbish compared to other people but
this is honestly like what I do
so I rinse my face when I dry my face
and then I moisturize so I'm just using
this I think it's soaking moisturizer
and it smells so nice as well so I'm
just going to put this on my face for I
jump into is this shower
the makeups off and I realized I was
breaking out so yep awesome so now my
cuddly bath I'm just going to take up my
contact lenses before I shower I just
changing to my glasses because I
literally can't see without my contacts
in
I know it's shower time so I'm just
going to pop into the shower and it
always takes like so long before it's
the right temperature it's just the
worse so that I am checking the
temperature
Shane well eggs
so after the shower I'm just going to
brush my teeth and then finish up
getting ready for bed
and how good of a special effects guys
amazing I'm using the Vaseline spray
moisturizer for my body I do this every
night
I love the spray moisturizer it's the
best and then I'm off into my bedroom
and just going to very dramatically
jump onto my bed told you so jumping
into bed I'm just going to start off by
reading the book that I'm reading at the
moment I like to just about half an hour
before bed and I'm reading love Rosie at
the moment
so when I've had enough it's time to
watch some pug videos and just chill out
on the Internet and then just on
Facebook I seriously spent so long on my
laptop guys it's not even funny
and then on YouTube even more but I
don't think Coco was very happy about me
watching the Pug video like you cry
every time so it's just taking off the
specs putting on the eye mask and it's
time for bed I hope you guys enjoyed my
nighttime routine
are we seeing you really soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
