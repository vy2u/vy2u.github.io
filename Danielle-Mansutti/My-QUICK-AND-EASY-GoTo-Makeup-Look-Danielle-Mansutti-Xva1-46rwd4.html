in today's video we're going to be
talking all that might go to makeup look
now not only is this so easy there's no
false lashes or anything literally the
way that I do my eye shadow in this
video that you're gonna see is just so
easy so messy it will take you literally
30 seconds like it's amazing and I would
wear this like going out clubbing and
work shopping I'd wear it everything
like it's insane how versatile this look
is I use my face up close and personal
so you can see a little bit like the
smokiness and stuff we're going to be
talking about today
I'm so excited share this with you I
wear this with all the time literally
every single post on my Instagram I'm
wearing this makeup look and you write
to find out how I did it so without
further ado I'm gonna fly through my
basement quickly because not much has
changed it's my last everyday makeup
tutorial like foundation and stuff I'm
still using the Urban Decay all nighter
foundation in 4.5 and I'll be applying
it with a Beauty Blender as well I
finally get the best finish I get the
best finish with a Beauty Blender with
this product find a brush to make it a
little bit a bit dry which is weird
right now for brows I'm going to using
the benefit Cabrera
this is in shade number 4 and I'm taking
the most extra brush you have ever seen
supply I love this brush it's from
morphe
rather now on so it's time to conceal
under our eyes I'm going to use in the
urinal or wake me up concealer and
absolute God nodding honestly so good
and I have just built it over my head
it's something but we're just gonna pop
and then with the Too Faced Born This
Way at powder I'm gonna pop oh my gold
about 31 everybody let's dump some
powder into the tray I have absolutely
no idea why I chose to fill my makeup
tutorial on white sheet that wasn't
thought very well at all but I'm just
gonna go put this under my eyes and use
it to sort of blend that consumer and
and also kind of just everything before
we start contouring and chiseling and
highlighting and making itself a great
gimmie and define we're gonna do the
eyes because I just love love the new
thing that I've been doing with it so I
was going to use the Too Faced Peach
palette for this and I'm going to use
these two top two Brown shades here now
what I've been doing is I'll grab a
sigma e30 pencil brush I'm going to use
it with peach cobbler okay little bit
closer you can see but what I'm gonna do
first is run this along my lower lash
line what I've been doing this is kind
of like smoked out Brown line of thing
this is how I started I like to use a
little bit of shadow about that much and
then I'll go back in and kind of smudge
it a little bit
and the best thing about it is that you
can be messy like it's made to be smudge
it's made to be messy and it just looks
really cool afterwards soon I will smash
another finger once again and I'm taking
the Charlotte Tilbury amber moon
eyeliner and I'm going to really tightly
line my lashline with that and again I'm
going to smudge it with my finger got a
bit of peach cobbler again just so that
that will blend all together so my
lashes I'm gonna be using the it
cosmetics super hero mascara this one
actually has the little crystals look
use that I'll just make quite all my top
lashes before I forget I have to set my
brows into place I'm just gonna use neat
benefit already set Brown I'm just gonna
use my be fun just do this because this
way and then I'm gonna take the Betty
tint in number 5 and can using my camera
as a mirror I'm just putting my benefits
runs the time time to make us nice and
brown my favorite part so I'm gonna use
this LC bronzer and I'm taking a multi
efore brush I like to use this bronzer
first and then I go in with like a kind
of shimmery one afterwards I love that
kind of like shimmery highlighting
bronzy thing okay we look nothing around
to put any excess on my chin I'm gonna
take this Milani baked bronzer which is
going pretty I'm using a big Sephora Pro
airbrush brush to highlight I'm using
the sea art a London moon dust highlight
it is gorgeous
and then blend it out put it oh my god
so let's do this lower lashline I'm
gonna grab the peach shade from before
and then we're on it alone and then
blend it through I'm not gonna go to
four because this is something which I
would quite easily wear during the day
but also something that I wear like
actors in there it kind of works for a
lot of different purposes but I just
find this look is so versatile so easy
and just subjective and just like that
it's lips time already so I'm gonna go
ahead and he's able there goes my stuff
on the floor I'm gonna be doing this
nude Charlotte Tilbury lip liner to
start now for my lipstick I'm using this
Christmas cookie lipstick is sent to me
in like a beauty by hole I think I
really love the color of this it's very
pretty so because so well without the
liner as well like it's insane how well
they go together
and of course we have to set everything
in place but I'm trying to go through
these very quickly and I always wonder
why and I'm like oh you know I wish you
joy myself in it and it's like say a
massive thank you for watching this
quick easy tutorial say let me know if
you decide to recreate it because it is
so easy like honestly it's amazing so if
you do regret it please tell me on the
photo on Instagram so I can find you and
