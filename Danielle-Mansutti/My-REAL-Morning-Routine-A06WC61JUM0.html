in today's fear I have my realistic
morning routine this time it's not
filled with like rainbows and sunshine
and very light candles because let's be
honest we all know um that's not real
that's just for your videos it might be
real for some people definitely not for
me so I wanted to show you what really
happens in the morning for me I'm being
so sarcastic in a few years so don't
take it too serious or anything like
that and before we jump straight to the
video if you aren't part of the family
already in the world sweet if you hit
that big red subscribe button down below
if you're on a mobile device I believe
it's like there somewhere if you're on
the computer it's somewhere down here
surfing the world to me if you would
subscribe ever get this video to about
20,000 thumbs up that would be
incredible so I really hope you guys
enjoy it and let's jump into it yeah
let's be honest waking up in the morning
isn't ly like my other morning routines
where I'm like singing and dancing it
was rainbows and smiles and all that
kind of stuff because I normally lie
there for like half an hour I think
should I get up or should I just stay in
bed and sleep all day and pretend that
I'm and then I'm like wait hold on a
minute I haven't stoked social media and
I'm really good at that so I normally
jump over to Instagram first I like to
just scroll and scroll and scroll and
scroll and like and like you know the
drill you know how it is and then I
normally like find myself on that
explorer page I don't know if you guys
have been on that but I get like
inspired for maybe 2.5 seconds if I see
a really gorgeous model and I'm like
damn I should have a salad today and I
should go for a run today and then about
a second later I'm like that's not gonna
happen and then I jump over to Twitter I
checked Twitter as you guys know I love
Twitter and then on Facebook I know if
you guys know this is an animals in pet
section which is just like completed my
life and I spend way too much time on
this and this is just like relatable to
my life right now that's how I feel
all day every day so after I'm finished
working as we youtubers call it I like
to you know really graciously make my
way out of bed and then just strut my
stuff over to the kitchen and like a
really lively manner through despair
much anything that gets me
but in the morning I love food I just
love food way too much so we're gonna
have a really nutritious healthy
breakfast this morning we're gonna have
cereal because let's be honest I don't
have the time well I do at the time but
I just can't be bothered to make a
really nice healthy breakfast in the
morning so damn we're having some Milo
cereal then we're gonna have this with
some nutritious milk which I found that
I got the wrong type I've got full cream
fat kind of milk and I'm like damn Danny
I never drink this kind of milk I
thought it was the pure light start but
it wasn't so good one Danny so I like to
have like you know one serving size of a
Milo cereal as you can see it's probably
feeds a whole family not one serving
size I put on a ton of milk as well
because you know I love to be healthy
and it's time to sit down and watch TV
and eat this is like the best time in
the morning this will get me out of bed
every single day and if you guys are
foxtail this is not sponsored by the way
if you do have Foxtel the anytime thing
is amazing I use that to watch Sex in
the City at the moment because I'm
trying to like watch the whole box set
and so I always see you in the morning
with my cereal feeling really healthy
and I sit and I watch Sex in the City
and I have a giggle by myself and I live
alone so I'm allowed to do this and the
most ugly clothes that I want and just
feel so ugly and just so happy and it's
great I'll normally watch an episode or
so and this will normally hit me around
this time I think damn Danny I smell
delicious and I should probably go and
get myself a shower but firstly it's
always really important to make your bed
in the morning so if you're really
productive and organized for the rest of
the day
so anyway after I'm done making my bed I
like to make my way over to my little
drawers here and then you know I open my
activewear drawer way to hopeful and I
have a look and I think
that's not going to happen so I walk
over to my wardrobe instead and thinking
what should I wear today maybe I should
wear some color for once and change it
up a little bit so I know we grabbed
something like this and I think oh that
would be really pretty but it's not
black so it's not going on I pick up the
same shirt that I wear every single day
of my life and I just think what a great
choice Danny the same toys you make
every single day seriously what is it
with showers and taking forever to get
the right temperature when I'm in the
shower it's lonely when I think about
life and all the wrong decisions that
I've made and then I also have a lot of
like shower thoughts I just start
thinking stuff like you know soup is
just like food flavored tea and what is
the meaning of life but it isn't
uncommon to have those kind of thoughts
anyway when you live alone like I do so
I'm going to brush my teeth make myself
smell like a functioning member of
society and do maybe tegu showing the
product to camera buyers so God's
putting my deodorant on and then I walk
over to like my little workstation this
is where I film and all that kind of
stuff it is a mess I didn't clean out
the video because I couldn't and then
I'm showing you my Spotify playlist
because this is what it was into every
single more sort of like get me in the
mood and get me going get me productive
and all that kind of stuff so this is
what I do actual normal person work I do
my comment to do my emails I do my
editing and all that kind of stuff so
this will take me anywhere between two
to maybe ten hours depending on how much
work I have during the day I have quite
a different version of mornings
sometimes sometimes I film sometimes I
dispatch eyelashes sometimes I edit and
sometimes I lay in bed all day and do
absolutely nothing so it really depends
on the day but I always find myself
getting distracted by other youtubers
and I watch KC nice dates vlogs every
single day or as often as I can because
I actually love his work he's my
favorite youtuber and when the Minnie
Mouse ears come out you know it's time
to get serious in terms of like a normal
human being and yes I apply the
foundation directly on my face like this
because it is just so gross but it's so
effective it's what I seriously do in
videos I'm always like hey I'm super
hygienic and I don't do that that I'm I
do this day I had an event later on the
day so I was doing quite like a full
face of makeup all of the time I don't
even put on makeup on a normal date the
next step in this routine is eyebrows
and this can take anywhere between one
to five break downs just depends on how
long it actually takes for me to apply
the eyebrow that day and after that I
move on to my eyes
yada yada yada you see there's a billion
at one times if you haven't seen it in
my makeup tutorials I do have a playlist
on my channel and this is very similar
to my clubbing routines if you do want
to see like an in-depth sort of makeup
tutorial even though half the time I've
absolutely no idea what I'm doing
feel free to check them out anyway cuz
why not so I'm putting on some mascara
and giving you a grand reveal of some
brand new ice by lashes that are
launching very soon that I wanted to use
these are the Wonder lash and they are
so gorgeous I hope you guys are so
excited because it's gonna come out in
September so I wanted to finish off the
look with them of course so now that I
have makeup on I'm going to pretend like
I just woke up like this and all that
and now I can finally use snapchat
filters because I look like a human
being once again and now that the
morning is pretty much complete I'm just
going to finish up what I'm doing on my
phone and walk towards my front door oh
my god guys you actually think I leave
my apartment I don't leave my apartment
I'm a youtuber so it's time for more
food yes so could you enjoy this
realistic morning routine as always if
you haven't subscribed it's right below
I love you all so much and I'll see you
all very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
