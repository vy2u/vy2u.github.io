in today's video I'm sharing with you my
shower and my hair care routine so
probably the most requested video I've
ever had on my channel is to share with
you my hair care routine how I wash my
hair how I eat my hair what products I
use all that kind of good stuff
and I am wearing a bikini in the shower
in this video we're going to reach a
whole new level of closer today when you
guys experience me in the shower we're
getting so close in this video so but
now earlier do a let's jump straight
into the video
my absolute obsession when it comes to
my hair are a selling products I use the
Big Love volumizing shampoo on my hair
and my favorite thing about this shampoo
it makes my hair so shiny and so thick
as well and because it is a sulfate free
shampoo it's perfect for fine or limp
hair when I looked more into the shampoo
I loved the fact that it has a blend of
proteins
it actually has vegetable protein and
that helps to boost the body and
moisture in my hair and the body
boosting polymer that it has lifts your
roots for increased volume in your hair
so it just makes it so perfect and thick
and beautiful and if you guys are
interested in a styling products I do
have a cheeky little discount for you
guys to get 50% off if you want to check
that in my description and to hydrate
and soften my hair I use the deeply
invested hair mask and it contains
nourishing argan oil and if you haven't
tried that on your hair oh my goodness
it's life-changing it's so amazing I
normally only use this mask on the ends
of my hair as it helps to strengthen and
repair any damaged strands and I use it
in only once a week as a deep
conditioning mask and it makes my hair
smell and look so good so now I'm
dancing like a crazy person while I'm
waiting for my hair masque to work so I
normally leave that on for about 10
minutes and in that time I will do my
shaving this is one of the Venus razors
which sort of glides with your body and
I love it so much that is the double
triple moisturizing shower lotion I
guess it's called all of my body and
wash my body and it makes my skin so so
soft then I wash off everything out of
my hair I wash the hair mask out and
makes my hair feels so smooth before I
move on to the conditioner and then I
use the big softy volumizing conditioner
and this is just a match made in heaven
with the shampoo that I use it also
contains the same vegetable protein body
boosting polymer and it also has Pro
vitamin b5 I know that sounds so
complicated but in basic terms that's
used to deeply moisturize your hair make
it really healthy and shine
now I'm quite a blonde I do love East
island products to keep my hair color
rich in vibrant because it has something
called a VB shield technology within it
so I'm always totally open about my
videos and east island did reach out to
me to be used in a video of mine so I
thought I would try it out first and I
honestly can swear by their products
because my hair has never felt softer
and healthier and shinier that I would
definitely genuinely recommend them to
you guys and now that I'm out the shower
I like to tap dry my skin because I do
fake tan so I don't drag the towel
around my face and I just start to dry
my hair a little bit with a towel before
moving on to the leave-in conditioner
like with the hair mask I only use the
leave-in conditioner about once a week
or maybe once every week and a half just
that I don't drown my hair and too many
products or anything I just apply this
to my ends and also just through the
roots of my hair and this just helps
keep it really soft and really shiny and
get ready for a creepy face right now
whoa there we go I'm gonna dry my hair I
use the curious grace hair dryer I swear
by this hair dry it's amazing and I do
not blow dry my hair like with
professional hair brushes and all that
kind of stuff
I am super lazy and all I do is just use
my fingers and just blow my hair until
it's dry and then I use the renewing
treatment oil on my hair just to protect
it and that is a nourishing blend of
argan oil antioxidants and vitamin E and
F for smooth and healthy hair the
increases shine it strengthens my hair
and it help protect my color from fading
as well it is honestly my secret weapon
I love it so much and it's perfect for
all hair types and at this point I'm
just going to keep blow-drying my hair
until it is absolutely dry I'm very
lucky that my hair dries quite straight
they do straighten the very front of my
hair just to make sure it's extra extra
extra straight and as you can see I'm
just totally dry my hair like a normal
person
right and then I was going to brush
through my hair and make sure it's all
completely dry before straightening my
hair I like to use a heat protectant on
the front I just feel like all that
scary sound when you straighten your
hair and it's like just scares me so
much
so heat protectant it's always a good
idea and I'm using the new me hair
straightener today and all I do is
straighten the front strands of my hair
I leave the back of my hair alone
because it's dried straight today so I'm
just going to leave that be and then I
just brush through and continue
straightening any parts that need it
and now it's time for this lower mohair
like you can see how shiny and vibrant
and healthy it's looking I'm sorry happy
enough to wear extensions anymore all my
hair and it's so healthy and I'm so so
so happy with the way it looks with
these products so I hope that you guys
enjoyed watching my shower and hair care
routine and it was a little bit close
for comfort but I hope that I explain
how I do what I do so that is all for
today I will see you guys really soon
and I have you ever really weak fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
