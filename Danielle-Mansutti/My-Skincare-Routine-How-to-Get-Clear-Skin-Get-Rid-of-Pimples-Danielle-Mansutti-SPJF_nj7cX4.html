literally don't think that I've ever
filmed a proper skin care routine before
like I've put them in other routines but
never film like a skincare routine
before so figured today we're making a
lot of sense to actually film one cuz I
might take off all my makeup I have got
five gazillion million trillion products
in my skincare all I'm gonna show you
what I would do to get from makeup on to
off to them the skin care routine
afterwards I've recently been breaking
out a little bit on my mouth as well
because I'm hormonal as hell and I'm a
stress head and I just break out all the
time and I eat lost chocolate and my why
my breaking out and so firstly I use the
Agana my Stella water to remove my
makeup I've been using this for years as
you know you've seen on my channel a lot
and I love using like they're really big
just absolutely dropping everything I
love the big cotton pads for this you
know reaches more area more surface all
that kind of stuff so you know what you
had makeup on all day if I'm wearing
lashes that is like the first thing that
I try and like get off but because I've
got lipstick on right now I'm always
just like get off my face like oh thanks
just making a pug noise and sorry about
that okay so I've got my pad already to
do I'm just gonna tuck my hair behind my
ears
no I will wear another lipstick first
because that is just not happening to me
and then I'll start with the sorry for
the dog for pug noises she's really
getting into it
what if he's doing I've used other
micelle orders there quite a lot
actually just about five or six
different brands but I don't know what
it is but in my cellar water yeah like
the Garnier one the may just works so
well I just don't know why it is my
favorite and with the mascara I have to
be really careful because I wear contact
lenses for my vision so I don't wanna
like you know drag those go right into
my eyes anything so I'll just very
lightly give it a little bit of a wipe
so my open hand is doing right there
pleasing cover that is delightful oh my
makeup is kind of off not really this is
like back in the day I used like leave
it like this put on moisturizer and I
was like see you later but I've learned
I have to look after my skin these days
so let me just throw out this disgusting
thing oh my water takes a long time to
get warm so that's just happen the next
product I like to use is the elements
Pro College in the cleansing balm I
really really really like this I think
it's just amazing for the skin that I
should put my hair in a bun owe me one
sec this is what the bug looks like on
the inside I've gone through I'm already
like honestly I love it okay what is
ready so I will put a bit on my skin not
too much because it is quite like oily
feeling and then I will go ahead I'll
rub that in and you can see I'm looking
nice and shiny right now and then I'll
do a little bit on my eyes too I'm not
gonna go too harsh I'll just be very
gentle noise and I thought what the
makeup was removed before oh oh my god
this is like proper clickbait kind of
look isn't it I don't elect into any of
that League for the purpose of this
video I want to show you like all the
things that I use but on a normal day I
just put on like a bit of moisturizer or
something after this and then that's
that as you can see I have got a few
pimples I'll get rid of them I have two
things that I use a TVs a glam glow
super mud or use the my own Mac Mario
Badescu variable it's good drying lotion
and for glam blue let's do a little bit
no on that problem area this is the
youth super mode I think it's called and
it is just the most fun in the world to
see it dry like it's over so as you can
see this is pretty name noise I will
actually cut to when this is drying and
you'll see what it does I honestly like
swear by this because it will actually
sucks out the dirt from your face I'm
gonna put over pimples I just find that
works really well for pimples as well so
see you in a second when it's dry so
it's been about a few minutes and you
can see overall those problem areas that
we saw how it's darker around those
areas and I think that it's just working
into magic right now and just sucking
out all that dirt and it's like do you
later it knows exactly where to target
which is nice I'll wait another two to
three minutes so ten minutes in total
and then I will get rid of all this
stuff but it's definitely sucking it out
we're pretty much done out with the
granblue so I'm gonna wipe that off
while my pores are nice and open
I will grab the Mario Badescu by despot
yeah gonna drive motion and I will pop
that on my open pimple I only recently
found out you're not supposed to showing
this so you don't shake it because
apparently doesn't work that way but
it's like stings when you put this on
your pimple but I'm like that it's a
good thing because it's working so I'll
pop that over the top and then we'll
wait a little bit before we put on a
moisturizer and also like I'm not on the
pill anymore because obvious reasons I
was on the pill for four years three or
four years or something and then I went
on Diane which was for my skin because
my skin got really bad I but heaps of
breakouts here on each side
so what died and then it was like $70
for like three months it was just
accepted and then since going off that
obviously we're skin has gotten a bit
worse however I find that these products
that I've used especially the LMS
cleansing cleansing cleansing balm and
the bad boy and the myrrh Badescu stuff
has kept my skin like in control photo
people's but nowhere near as many as I
would if I wasn't using them and also
yes I drink lots of water and on the
diet all that kind of skincare you know
normal stuff
water is very beneficial but we all know
that by now
and also eat your veggies eat your
bloody veggies they helped me skin a lot
as well they make your face Ballu okay
it's been a few minutes now I'm gonna
use my moisturizer and goodies the
origins gel moisturizer this smells so
good like honestly it smells amazing I
know I took my hair up because I'm just
gonna put it up again other things that
I've done that really helped my skin is
to actually change my pillowcase a lot
more often because that's where all the
dirt is sitting from every day and
everything and also stop touching your
face it's probably the biggest thing or
they get pimples and then they start
touching the pimple and it's just like
spreading way more dirt into your face
that you don't need so try and leave it
alone try to wear moisturizer on my neck
as well you should put all your skincare
on your neck because you don't want that
to wrinkle when you get older anyway for
me I don't like cleanse my neck because
I wear fake tan that it's just wouldn't
work very well for me that I can't tell
you like this moisturizer is mmm smells
so good so good and here I am Beth base
so my skin is feeling nice and glowy and
fresh right now and a bit naked and in
it but this is all the stuff that I'm
currently using for my skin - the area
the fact that I'm probably getting my
lady things in a few days could explain
that as well but I hope you guys
enjoy this video and it helps you
understand what I use why use it how to
use it all that kind of stuff only for
quiet please in the description below as
always so until next time guys have an
amazing week and I'll see you on Sunday
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
