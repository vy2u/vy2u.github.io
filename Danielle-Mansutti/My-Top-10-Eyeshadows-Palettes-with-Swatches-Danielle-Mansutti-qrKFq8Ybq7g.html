so excited about today's video because
if you know me you know that I love our
shadow I shadow is like my favorite
makeup product and I'm all better shut
up I thought why not show you my 10 top
eyeshadows / eyeshadow palettes I hope
you guys like this kind of veer I got
inspired to this by Crystal Conte's and
speedy crystal before we jump straight
into it if you do see this mark on my
arm
and you do follow me on social media you
know I had a bit of a tumble so don't be
too alarmed I know it's like bull but
yeah it's healing as always ignore that
so jumping straight into it this is a
number 10 this is the Stila eyes the
window shadow palette in mind this
palette is completely matte it's full of
warm matte friends but also has a few
cool tones so it's got a really it's not
just warm I am a shimmer girl but I
thought I would just play around this
anyway as you can see not many of these
eyeshadows have been touched however I
have loved this this shade so like the
purples and the Reds and creamy shade
are lovely I have not yet used the more
smoky shades or the lighter shades but
I've heard of really good things about
this palette I love steals eyeshadows in
general they have really good quality
eye shows and the shimmery eyeshadows is
like oh sorry some shimmery eyeshadows
soon it's like what like the number 9 we
have the Too Faced semi-sweet chocolate
bar palette what I really liked about
this palette as opposed to the original
chocolate bar palette is the fact that
the names are on I shouldn't be so I
have to keep googling what the name is
in this palette I love this shade
caramel pink sugar and cocoa chili
coconut cream is also very good because
the original chocolate bar colors
the pigment of the white eye shadows in
the original chocolate bar palette
aren't very good it is coconut cream one
good when I'm eight
we have there naked the Urban Decay an
American palate this is the original
Naked palette however I recently
purchased this so I think this is like
the updated original one and when people
ask what Navy pilots should I get I
always say get the first because it's
just unbeatable the other two are good
for this one it's just a lot better to
me because I love half-baked I think
half-baked is and I love sidecar bucket
smog and possible they are my favorites
so number seven we actually have an
individual eyeshadow this is from
colour-pop and his name is coconut the
most gorgeous blue shade you've ever
seen in your life this is the best blue
eyeshadow I've ever used
I love it so this is such as such such a
such a gorgeous shade I love the way it
shimmers as well it's so beautiful I'm
yet to actually use this in a tutorial
on my channel I have use it a lot on
myself for like an everyday thing it
looks so good used in like the inner
corner or the lower lash line for a pop
of color but it is gorgeous I love it
and I would definitely recommend this
color taupe eyeshadow in America that
this is five dollars next we have a good
old chichi I'm sure you all remember
when actually brush I'm sure that you
all remember how obsessed I used to be
with Chi Chi still of them the bronzes
palette in my opinion is their best
palette it is very very very similar to
the make
but a lot of gorgeous shimmery gold
tones it's got a few warm purples and
then it's got to keep greens as well so
I never used the cranes I always stuck
to the goats I used to use this palette
every day this is like my go-to palette
it's got my hair on the back you can
Australia or New Zealand just get
hands-on this at Target oh my I believe
they sell them out it's very nice and
honestly you make so many looks for
these palettes they're really versatile
and I still love Tootie I'm not gonna
lie I still love them we have yet
another color pop by shudder and this is
a millionaire and this is just the most
gorgeous eyeshadow you have ever seen
like I'm a sucker for like gold shimmery
eyeshadows and just when I got this I
was like whoa that is gorgeous so this
has so many to schooi throughout it it
just looks really pretty very very
comparable to half-baked however I like
this a little bit more than The Naked 1
palette half-baked but it is stunning
and forth we have this beautiful palette
which is the morphe at 35 and palette
okay I have made so many different looks
just from this palette alone the river
while ago I did like a dark purple
smokey eye similar to this but darker
and I use pretty much does everything in
this corner here I was using my day
tonight makeup look and it's just so
versatile I think what I'm looking for
is I mean you can excite if it looks
from it and it is so affordable
especially for us because I'm pretty
sure I paid like 30 something dollars
this whole palette and I'm like what in
Australia the Naked palette alone is
like $80 I am such a good price I sound
like a mafia
salesperson right now but honestly guys
this palette is just every girls like go
to makeup Hut I would recommend this so
much for starters for beginners they're
so lasting and they're beautiful and
they're vibrant so there's my sales
pitch from morphe for number three we
have the Stila in the light palette do
believe this palettes might be
discontinued now but honestly kitten and
bubbly are the most amazing choice ever
I love these two shades right here I
also loved sunset the shimmers in this
palette are just unbeatable as I said
before like stealer that quality is just
both wow it's so good it's just a dream
this is just like my perfect palette I
think this is the perfect palette it's
not only does it have a really dark dark
dark shade but it just has all the warm
shades and stuff they always lean
towards the only shade in this whole
palette I wouldn't use is night sky
because I don't like great tones and the
thing is I'm trying really hard not to
like use everything in the color because
I can't buy another one because I think
if I do individual eyeshadow is a hope
that I have kittens because I've shaded
like whoa drumroll for second place we
have the Too Faced love pilot ride this
section here first and oh my god I was
like wow I thought the two fights talked
about parts are good and then I tried
this one and I was like what I
absolutely loved the hot color in the
middle here especially mixed with this
shimmery shade on the side I also
actually really liked the green eye
shadows I have actually tried the green
eyeshadows believe it or not a bit out
of my comfort zone but I have tried them
and I love them the quality of these
eyeshadows in my opinion are absolutely
outstanding they are so beautiful well I
was just wondering when ever just
wondering the grass a few months ago I
just used this shade here and that's it
and I love them like when I shadow you
wearing and all
like it's literally just one eyeshadow
from this palette I actually have seen
zoella loving this as well and I'm not
surprised because it really is beautiful
and I love the LOV palette very punny
and you have probably guessed to find
out the winner of all winners is the Too
Faced chocolate bar this is my favorite
palette ever for quite a few reasons so
not only is it beautiful I could put on
these eyeshadows eight in the morning
and then I'm going to bed at midnight
and they're still on perfectly these
colors are the best colors the best
range of colors you can make so many
different eye looks from it and I
generous the lure I do not want to like
it kind of makes even because I love it
and the best part about it is that it
smells like a chocolate bath just go
into a shop and smell the palette
because it is amazing I love it so the
smell of this is sorry sorry so so good
and I love how there's a huge variety of
tones shades colors got your shimmers
around here and all started here having
mattes you've got a bit of a green shade
of blue shade a sort of purplish shade
and then you've got your primarily warm
tones but also with a few neutral and
cool tones however the true white shades
in this palette I'm not the best in the
world that okay but pigments me like if
you don't have much I shudder we were
just starting out learning about makeup
or you want to ask for a Christmas
present or something I would definitely
recommend this palette for beginners for
people you've been to makeup for a long
time like seriously
in love and then you have my top ten at
favorite palettes honestly would
recommend all of them are not palettes
are shadows and palettes and all sorry
for today can we leave in the comments
what is your favorite eyeshadow of all
time and we will have a chat so I hope
