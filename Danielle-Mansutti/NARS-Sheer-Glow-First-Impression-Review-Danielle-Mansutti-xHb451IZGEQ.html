today I have a first impression on the
NARS sheer glow foundation this is not a
new foundation is this is far from a new
foundation but it is a new foundation to
me so I thought I may as well try it for
the first time on camera and give you my
honest first impression a foundation
obviously so I got this shade of
Barcelona and the one thing that really
brought me towards trying this
foundation is the fact that it has no
SPF and that should mean that photos
look really great I'm hoping that this
will match me quite well
nice foundations are quite yellow but
most guys I do affect and effect and
Norma is quite yellow so hopefully it's
all good
so of course about tie-back this main
that we have in the way and I'm going to
talk about like all the description of
the foundation and what it says on the
box after I apply it just because I
think you guys would rather see how it
looks fast there we go I look like a
little child now so I'm going to use my
Beauty Blender to apply this foundation
today just because I love my Beauty
Blender I just don't like these and
foundation brushes any more so I will
use my Beauty Blender and the latest
doesn't have a pump and we all know how
I feel about no pump no oh well looks
like we're doing the old hand trick so
I'm just going to put a little bit on
the back of my hand
you can do it let's see how I go as you
can see I do have a few little breakouts
around the side which I seem to have had
nap a month missus won't go away so
hopefully this will cover - I'll see
other coverages so there's no smell
thank God
do you like the coverage it's not crazy
full-on coverage but it's just nice and
sheer and it looks like it could be
buildable so I probably will put a
little bit more foundation around my
mouth I have my breakouts okay so
looking now I've just done the bottom
half of my left side I think the color
match is quite spot-on it might be a
tiny bit darker than my turn that's okay
I can always make my tan darker I'm
liking this color for my skin it just
it's weird it's making my breakouts are
kind of purple kind of weird I know why
much of it so you can see the over that
but it's not covering my breakouts
amazingly but I'll keep adding and see
how I go okay so my foundation is now
completely on I feel like the color
match of this foundation to my neck is
almost perfect it's really really really
good I'm really happy with it the
coverage is great I would say it's a
medium coverage you can actually still
see my breakouts and they look almost
purple which is the only thing it's a
little bit weird about that so now I am
going to read out what it says on the
website about the foundation and just
speak about it a bit more in depth
because now that you've actually seen
how it looks in my face I think it'll
make more sense when I read out the
fiendish you know we can like compare it
to what I've
fan so far so I was reading off the
Sephora website and it says that it is a
glowing satin finish foundation with
Shira and buildable coverage I would
agree that it is a satin finish
foundation I don't know if I'm glowing I
don't think it's that chewy but I would
say it is any satin finish white this
formula hydrates the skin while
complexion of brightening properties
improve skin brightness radiance and
texture leaving skin with a luminous
since your glow too much they have a lot
of shades I think they have 20 to 30
shades and they're mainly yellow based
so yeah I am going to finish getting
ready I have another video to film and
then I will pop back I'll check in with
you guys and then three hours later I'll
check in again after I go out because
I'm going for a bit of like a non-combat
a walk or something damn it holds up
because it is raining outside today and
we'll see how it looks after a bit of
rain I'll do a photographer test and
then I'll check in with you guys tonight
so just so you know it is now 10:35 a.m.
and I'll check in with you around 12:00
hello guys I'm looking a bit more made
up with now it is now 1:00 p.m. I had
this awesome so that is to enough hours
I guess it was really bad at maths at
school who's like carrying my baby soon
it's now been on for two and a half
hours I filmed in Europe and I've been
in front of hot lights and stuff and so
far especially on camera it looks really
nice I will just zoom you in really
close and personal I do think the color
match is really nice in terms of my do
you have any books sort of like a brush
especially after the whole opposite
oxidizing a process it just sort of
looked a lot better than it did when I
first put it on so it's sort of getting
better with time not much I can do about
these uninvited guests right now but um
all in all I'm very happy with how it's
looking what I'm gonna do Thursday I'm
just gonna have some lunch and I'm going
to go on that big walk that I said
before and I'm gonna come back at like
maybe 5 or 6 p.m. and I'll check out
around then just because I don't want to
check in a few times I don't want to
keep running back and forth back and
forth back and forward just saying it's
still nice it's too nice so I'll come
back at in about five hours and see how
it's lasting throughout the whole day so
only one thing that I'm not very happy
about this no what are the best
foundations do this doing I always get
like the crusty wrinkle mmm nice anyway
I'll check in with you guys soon so haha
hi guys it is now 6:30 2 p.m. I've had
this on for 8 hours now and I'm very
pleased with that so it does seem to be
only these lines which have dried up I
am a hundred percent going to use this
foundation again however because in
photography and on video it works so
well going out clubbing where you're
going to party an event or something
whether it's gonna be lots of flash
photography a hundred percent would
recommend this foundation so the other
day I'm going to give this foundation an
8 out of 10 and the last two points just
because of how dry it's gotten into my
lines it had sort of sunken in and made
me look really wrinkly besides that I've
absolutely loved it and the car match I
think has been spot-on I am going to gym
now and I don't want to Winsted you my
hate don't make up the gym so I'm gonna
take it off I hope you guys have a great
week and I'll see you really soon bye
now the morning after
my choice all the way back to mommy it
contains two hours
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
