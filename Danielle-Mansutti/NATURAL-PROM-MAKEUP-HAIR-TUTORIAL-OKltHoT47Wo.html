today's video I have this prom makeup
tutorial to show you it's just super
super girly and super simple and I've
also kept in mind that you were possibly
on a budget so I have made sure that
most of the products are quite
affordable and quite accessible I'll
also be showing you how to do is really
easy cute updo which I think it's like
perfect for prom so effortless and so so
simple at least you takes a minute or
less so I'm gonna get straight into the
and makeup portion now and then the hair
 will be at the end before we
jump into it if you already subscribed
to my channel I would love to have you
on board all you have to do is hit that
big red button down below and without
further ado let's do it so we are
starting with this og which is the Too
Faced hangover primer I love this it's
such a golden oldie for me but it is so
perfect for days like prom because it
just gets you so hydrated and so ready
for foundation I'm using a 310 Sun beige
in the Maybelline fit me matte
I love the coverage it gives me and it
really really really does last a day and
looks fantastic in photos and make sure
to blend down to your neck as well don't
forget that it's very important next
step is brows this is totally optional
if you have to fill in your brows like I
do I highly recommend the sleek brow kit
is my favorite right now and I do have a
full eyebrow tutorial if you like to say
it I will leave a card here in the
corner
now we are jumping over to eyes and I'm
going to use the two-faced white peach
palette and start with peach smooth now
as you can see I am NOT being a
perfectionist whatsoever I decided with
these light pink colors just to do the
wintry wiper motion but not kind of
focused too much on one area because I
want to keep this natural and beautiful
and girly so basically I've just kind of
made my whole lid pink because we're
gonna put a really pretty pigment over
the top and then I'm adding a lighter
color to my lid before we jump into the
pigment and the pigment is legitimately
amazing
so it's from Primark and it cost about
like two pounds it's so good I'll leave
a card to my prymaat video if you want
to see more about it but we're just
gonna put on a little bit of glitter
glue first and then add the pigment over
the top so I kind of focused on a very
kind of soft halo eye so I'm focusing
most of the pigment in the middle of my
eye and then working my way outwards but
like I said before this is meant to be
quite a simple look so I'm not going to
make it too drastic with the lines or
anything I just blend it in and make it
look nice and pretty
it is concealer time and I'm using the
it cosmetics bye bye under-eye concealer
and you can also use this to fix any
lines or any fallout from a pigment I
did have a little bit of fallout so I
made sure to clean that up before
setting it with my peach perfect powder
from Too Faced
now with any putter left in the tray
I'll just grab a big brush and I'll put
this over the rest of my face but I use
the beauty blender under my eye
specifically to set the concealer now
it's time for mascara and I'm using the
it cosmetics superhero mascara and
honestly I've had a lash lift recently
and I could not recommend it enough like
look at the difference it's in saying
and you don't wear falsies or anything
so it's perfect for events like this and
then two bronze ourselves up we're gonna
use the hoola Bruns up by benefit
so after bronzing of course comes glow
I'm using this NYX born to glow palette
and it is so good honestly this makes me
so happy when this happens
look I'm just like yes it's so good to
just add some dimension and glow and
honestly like I do think it proms a time
you can go a little bit overboard with
it so I'd say just have fun with
highlight then I'm just gonna add a
little tiny tiny tiny bit of eyeshadow
to my under eyes I don't wanna make it
too dark because we're keeping it light
and pretty and then I'm just gonna pop
on a bit of mascara under my eyes as
well using the same superhero look see
be here at mascara we used before and
then I'm gonna add some California blush
my cheeks and I never wear blush that
this for me was like a big deal now I'm
using this NYX powder puff lipstick it's
so sick like on the application feels
may see and then I wanted to kind of you
know enforce up a bit because it's a
prom thing so I'm adding this Tarte lip
link to my lips just to give it a little
bit of something some make it pop make
it look pretty and then of course the
most important step is to set everything
I use the Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray and this is a must for
prom so now it is time for the hair and
honestly just curl your hair before and
I'm gonna do at my eyebrows is pick up
my hair put it half behind my head pull
out some strands in front then tie up
the top half and in thank you to a face
lift as well as amazing for photos then
I'm just going to you know pull out some
strands mess it up tighten everything
then I grab my brush tease it make it
big
Coffee and you are literally done it is
so easy so thank you guys so much for
watching this prom tour today I really
hope you enjoyed it and if you do decide
to recreate this look then please tag me
on Instagram I would love to see your
recreations and if you can tag me on the
photo instead of the caption it's more
likely that I'll see it and I hope you
guys have an amazing prom season and
until next time guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
