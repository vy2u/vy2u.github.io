I'm not using my normal body camera I am
going to a concert by myself I've never
done this before I mean I've only been
to the movies what myself once and I
actually really enjoyed it so yeah it's
an incredibly nerdy thing I also haven't
done my hair yet hence my looks so
greasy but I'm gonna drown it in dry
shampoo in a second so if you know me
well you know that I am a nerd at heart
and growing up I was obsessed with my
Nintendo my brother is a games graphic
designer now I already did growing up
was like playing games and Zelda was one
of the best best business best games or
Nintendo and I've played like every
single Zelda I'm massively obsessed of
that franchise and they have there Zelda
Orchestra of all the music from the
games in London tonight which I'm going
to buy myself because I knew that none
of my other friends would be interested
in that and I would only ever go that
with my brother but he's kind of on the
other side of the world which makes it a
little bit hard so when I went to VidCon
in Australia I actually landed two days
after it was on in Melbourne so we just
missed it then as well so I figured I
covered myself and I'm not actually too
nervous I was more nervous booking it by
myself because I was like it's not
really kind of weird and a bit strange
to go to the concert by yourself but now
I'm just kind of like screw it like who
cares I'm not gonna have to worry about
the person next to me enjoying it or not
because I'll just enjoy it as much as I
want to and that's the good thing like
it should be really cool experience and
tomorrow I'm going to an event on my own
it's for Lipsy and I don't know anyone
that's going up not met anyone there
before it's not the normal kind of like
Beauty crowd so I'm doing lots of things
on my own over the next few days I'm
very excited
I think being good by yourself kind of
opens you up to more opportunities as
well so yeah as well as my toilets been
like sitting in the back though
banes oh my god smarter tomorrow
tomorrow I could finally be getting my
car I found a mini and to get there it's
like gonna take you to enough hours
another Noah but hopefully I'll be
driving home in a mini tomorrow's they
stay tuned for that the flu and last but
not least before I do actually leave the
giveaway winner will be announced at the
end of this vlog it was on my Instagram
it was these naked palettes and later on
it you and I will be going through
randomly scrolling and picking biggie
boy win it together and then once this
video is up there'll be another giveaway
on my Instagram so make sure you follow
my Instagram so that you can see first
all the giveaways and get in there first
because I'll be doing so many for
Christmas
to give back to you guys I swear every
time I put my beanie on I get like
tumblr flashbacks I'm just like oh my
god it's I spy don't yell if you
remember that or you remember hello
Danny then you are a true oh gee oh gee
choo-choo-choo-choo this guy
good morning Feeny is currently still
dark outside with still trying to wake
up out with beanie it's too early it is
about 7:00 a.m. I'm heading off to this
car showroom this morning I have an
event tonight so I had to do this really
early and get out of the way first and
it's so far away in the middle of
nowhere so I'm gonna be heading off in a
second to go did that hopefully leave
with a car let's hope so and then if I
do leave with a car I'll have to go to
the council and wait like three hours to
get seen to to get a parking permit all
these fun adult things and then in
between that time I've still got to like
come home and have a bath wash my hair
shave my legs tan get ready for an event
tonight before I leave it like for fun
I'm just like how am I gonna manage this
oh oh oh my god I teared up so much as
so much nostalgia and like it was very
good but the orchestra themselves had to
stop on point I'm not sure why they
stopped like five minutes and we didn't
have any explanation and it went silent
it was a bit awkward and then someone in
the audience just started like humming
and whistling one of the songs and then
all the crowd started singing along and
it was like really really cool says my
night experience it was really fun it
was a really good night
so beanie is pestering me because she
wants to have a bit of a walk before I
leave I'll do that now so I'm gonna have
my ear sniffed and then I'm gonna
finally hopefully we'll have a car I'm
in my car I got a mini I'm so excited oh
yeah look at me I'm so tired I've got to
go to event now and I'm literally
running off for our sleep and I'm so
died but I got I gotta go I got a car I
will let you know all about it in a
second but I literally have half an hour
to do my hair and makeup my tan
everything so I'm running so far behind
because when I went to buy this car my
bank blocks my card again
it took ages to leave but they got happy
and hello I'm looking at slightly
different now and I absolutely hate my
makeup I absolutely hate my hair I'm
having one of those moments and this
always happens when I rush I am wearing
some of the luxe collection lashes I
will leave them in a card for you right
here so you can see them if you don't
really have them they are these bad boys
and they are so flippin good I'm wearing
shook right now and I absolutely love
them today is not my day some things are
just gone wrong again and I'm just
rushing and I hate rushing need to go
now
so I'll see you guys at the event whoo
so when I was having that breakdown
being a girl is fun
I've never been anywhere like it's gonna
be so Justine exhale
you know human ratios good morning I'm
in my car I'm driving it's so exciting
I'm going to the garden center to find
some Christmas bits and emotes because I
love Christmas as you probably know it
Mike so I will talk to you when I'm okay
I'm here I can chat again so just before
I run in I suppose I have a quick little
update so when I went to the Lipsy event
it was so beautiful that I can't even
explain how gorgeous it was I've never
been to an event like her and the
dinners like everything was just set up
so well and I was around always like
fashion bloggers and sitting there like
Camilla from love Ireland I was like oh
my god this is amazing but it was so so
so so cool so when I had my little mini
meltdown beforehand which you guys saw
in the vlog I don't know if I said this
or not but I was leaving no I did say
the Trece she did not yet so um yeah I
was leaving and I was like you know you
just know and I kind of felt something
and I was like I got my period it'll
make sense so basically you guys have
seen me in pms mode now which is not
pretty it's just like everything oh my
god it was so funny but yes jiving it is
so called who driving again I have lost
so much confidence with driving though
like I'm just I don't know I'm very
anxious when I Drive and I think also
being on the English road it's so
unfamiliar to me there's certain signs
I've noted what it means just little
things like in Australia when motorway
so if you call freeways in Australia
completely different rules so like I'm
so used to undertaking people and stuff
because that's allowed an Australian
here that's like so not allow do you
always have to like take over take on
the right all this kind of stuff I'm
just like oh yeah I can't do that but I
bet the garden centre today because I
want to get some nice Christmassy bits I
want to film like a decorating my house
for Christmas vlog I think that would be
really cool that will probably be out
next Friday or something because I'm
going to Bruges more to the Christmas
markets my friend Alana
I'll be doing that on another vlog and
that's super exciting as well yeah I've
never been to British Brussels Brussels
Brussels or anything we're getting the
bus there from London which would take
about six or seven hours
I'm just staying in a hostel and then
coming back on the Sunday but yeah it's
so wait to be driving again it's so
weird to just be like I want to go to
this place and to be able to go there
liked it I was like I want to get some
Christmas stuff and I was like oh wait I
could just drive it's so weird
in love with Christmas and because it's
like my first proper Northern Hemisphere
Christmas since obviously moving back
it's just so exciting oh my god I just
realized you guys haven't actually seen
my car properly yet but there it is my
pretty little beast missus literally in
my heaven oh my god and I'm so bad with
this stuff I look at this and I'm I I
could use that and I think actually why
would I need that but it's just so
pretty and I want it my hands look so
white what the hell question if anyone
has a mini please help me help I have my
USB plugged in but it's just not playing
my music educated ok here I phone it
says the song that's playing right but
it plays through my iPhone and not
through the car speakers and I'm very
confused because it's obviously talking
they're obviously connected why is it
playing the Rideau the speakers I don't
understand does anyone know how I fix
this like I can do I control everything
through this so I can go like next song
why are you playing through here I'm
confused is it because it's like a stand
someone help me please
all right home I'm gonna show you what I

Christmassy stuff I'm so excited to
decorate oh my god I know
Oh No you asleep upstairs hey you still

this is Jade ice ice JD you have won my
giveaway so Jade if you're watching this
I will send you a direct message and get
this sent to you ASAP but
congratulations so I'll have that set
off on Monday to you before I sign off I
just have a quick word about this week
so you guys have seen this look I went
to quite a few events on my own so with
this elder thing I was a completely on
my own and the Lipsy thing I went on my
own I didn't know anyone that was going
and I got there
I knew of Ali then you off Camilla but
this first-timer actually met them but
can I just say that going to concerts
alone or events alone it's really good
if you've ever wanted to go to a concert
to a band or something and your friends
don't really like them but you like them
when you don't want to miss out please
go please like I honestly think that it
is such better to be alone than to be
sitting next to someone who might be
really bored and make you feel like
you're having the rubbish time and
embarrassed because they're bored with
their Zelda concert literally no one
noticed that I was alone because
everyone is so focused on themselves and
their group like no one's gonna know no
one's gonna look at you and like she's
by yourself it's just it just doesn't
happen so being alone is fine I know
from now on if there's a movie I want to
see a concert I want to go to and
there's no one that I can go with I'm
just gonna call my own it's fine
seriously it is completely fine but that
is all from me for this vlog I will see
you on Tuesday in my Bruges Christmas
markets blog and then we will do some
house decorating next week some more
home store moving blog kind of things so
hope you guys are excited and I have you
ever really awakened by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
