am doing a demo and a review on at the
Too Faced Born This Way Foundation this
foundation comes in 12 shades I'm at my
lightest right now because I'm not
wearing my fake tan so I'm in the shade
new today just before I jump into the
demo today I'm just going to read off
what the box says just so you know what
to expect from the foundation itself so
it's called the Born This Way
undetectable medium to full coverage
foundation the foundation comes in this
gorgeous glass bottle it's like a
frosted glass and I think that it's
absolutely gorgeous as a gorgeous Too
Faced lever on the top as well and then
the shade on the bottom so I really like
it's very simple but very effective I
always love Too Faced packaging their
packaging is so good and then you know
that eyeshadows are like so amazing
smelling I cannot even describe I've
told you guys if you ever walk into a
makeup store there's a two-faced and run
over sniff it run out so as you can see
I am a pale well today this is like the
first video I've filmed without fake ten
because I didn't wear anything town
Europe and I got back last night so I'm
pretty jet-lagged I'm like okay we love
doing fake tan and also I got quite a
few little breakouts and I was away
because I had the worst day ever
hmm well that's why is an oil-free
foundation that master Fleet diffuses
the line between makeup and skin for
coverage so undetectable you can't see
the makeup and you can't see the
imperfection
oh that's left it's natural radiant skin
that looks like you were born this way
this revolutionary foundation is infused
with a part of a combination of coconut
water to naturally replenish moisture
levels next is resilient Alpine rose to
brighten the skins appearance of her
March elasticity and heroine ik acid for
smoother more youthful appearance yeah
I'm so excited to try this and then it
just says I'll let them think that you
were born this way so it is a medium to
full coverage foundation and it is oil
free so I'm hoping I'm not going to look
super dewy and stuff because
always looks kind of weird on my skin
this foundation was released earlier
this week it was released on the 15th of
June and it retails in the US in Canada
for $39 I believe I'm not too sure about
how much it would retail at Mecca for us
Aziz it also just like to be super
honest and let you know that I've been
in conversation with Too Faced about
this product because you guys know that
I'm obsessed with their products and
they wouldn't kind enough to send me out
so many different shades so I've got
lots of choice for like when I picked
out when I'm not that tan but I feel
like this one in the shade nude will be
the best match to my natural skin tone
it's not that yellow it's more of a
neutral color so I'm hoping that it will
be okay I'm so excited to give it a go
and I'm going to use a sponge to blend
this into my skin so I'm just going to
start by applying it with my fingers and
then I'm just going to go with a sponge
over the top I'm using not a full pump
for this I'm using like a tiny pea sized
for the start just because I don't know
what the consistency will be like just
yet
I'm also going to go ahead and blend it
down to my neck
I think the biggest difference right now
is because my nose got a little bit but
when I was away and you can see from
doing half my face when nose looks so
different at least I that's so weird
iris managed to cover this half of my
face with a single pump which is so good
it's funny because I've never looked
this pedal on camera before so me just I
think ten but I'm sure you guys are
gonna be like I love your like natural
face again
and I need to probably embrace it a
little bit more so here's a close-up of
the foundation now on and I cannot
believe how amazing it looks it's so so
so so natural and it just looks like my
skin so I feel that the finish of this
foundation is matte but it's still very
radiant without being Joey and now that
is an amazing finish because you can see
it's almost like a luminous finish but
without the sweaty
Joey kind of look I also found that it's
very buildable I did only use one pump
for each started my face however I have
added a little bit more on my chin and
also over here because of the blemishes
but I think because it's oil free and
weightless as well it's just worked
really really really really really well
for my skin and I'm so excited to see
how this will last throughout the day so
I am going to continue getting ready I'm
gonna add some contour and stuff because
I'm looking a little bit too white so
we're gonna fix that I'm gonna get some
definition in this face cuz it's a bit
right now the formula just looks so
great so I'm hoping it will last
throughout the day and I'll check in
with you guys really soon so I just film
my intro it's actually been four hours
since I put on the foundation I don't
really have another foundation that
looks like this what I find with the
finish of this foundation is that it
actually looks like my skin it doesn't
really look like a cakey foundation it
doesn't have really dewy stuff and it
doesn't sink into my lines which is a
huge thing because you guys know from my
other first impressions most foundations
sink into my lines here and also along
my forehead but this one doing
hallelujah
one thing about this foundation
which just absolutely makes it so unique
compared to every other foundation out
there and that's it has coconut water as
an ingredient and that's perfect for all
skin types even dry skin so good for
your skin but I think it's such an
awesome thing that they have coconut
water within the bottle as well so I
think that's so cool I don't think I
have any other foundation as coconut
water in it so that gets to massive
thumbs up for me I will leave a photo at
the end to let you know what it looked
like before I went to sleep so thank you
guys so much for watching today I really
hope that you enjoyed it and I'll see
you really soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
