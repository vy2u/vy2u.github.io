channel I am so excited because I'm
finally sharing with you all of the
Urban Decay vice lipsticks are a hundred
different shades of lipsticks in here
with six different finishes as well
which is absolutely crazy and I deserve
in the caves biggest alone up yet Wow
a 100 lipsticks in Theo's is literally
the size of me this is huge I'm like hey
today we are going to review these
lipstick and i swatched about 50
different colors to share with you and
we talked about formulas and how I found
them and everything like that just do a
little bit of a mini review so close so
with the lipstick range which she has
everything you could ever want and want
even joking any color you can think of
any finish you can think of it's in
there seriously you've got your bulb
right so put your dark but your nudes
and put everything in between and you've
also got six different finishes as well
for a super intense mat that is mega
match Urban Decay's creamiest matte is
called comfort that the original creamy
that loves luxury is cream cream with a
high level of pearl is called metallized
a little punch of color like a sheer
shiny finish is called sheer and a
transparent finish with like a smooth
texture is called sheer shimmer so this
first one is alpha which is a mega matte
next we have tilt which is a comfort
matte then we have Sancho which is a
metallized lipstick
next we have obsessed which is a sheer
lipstick and finally we have
ex-girlfriend which is a sheer shimmer
Oh
Oh
zwei
you
Oh
cycle reason
okay
you
so I was lucky enough to get my hands on
these lipsticks a little while ago when
I went to New York for the whole vice
launch with Ruby Rose and since then
I've used them so often because I
literally have every single color I
could everyone in there the thing that I
love the most about the lipsticks and
this is like so hard to find look at
these days is the creaminess and the
pigmentation just with one swipe because
for me I'm the kind of person that I
feel like I have to be like rubbing
lipstick on my lips to get it even just
like look like it's not a tiny bit so
with this it's so nice just give it one
swipe and it's on completely and it just
makes it so much easier like so much
easier see the Opera Australia like
yours really you can get these
exclusively at a Mecca Maxima from the
23rd of August or you can find on the
website at Mecca comte you I really hope
you guys enjoyed this little review it's
a nice chunky again and I'll see you all
very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
