like
hello good morning my love's it is
Wednesday and today is so exciting
because we have like a surprise secret
itinerary and I became like buzzing - I
know it is
no one has like any idea what it is well
it's kind of annoying is that you know
the first day when it was raining and I
couldn't buy anything and because it was
raining I was going to buy like a whole
bunch of new outfits and I didn't have
the time to do that so I got an outfit
repeat that from the first day again
just without the rainbow socks this time
because I plan to get like so many
t-shirts and so many nice tops but I
only brought like three top so that's
why I'm out of it repeating so we just
had an amazing little surprise delivery
from it we were given these gorgeous
Thomas Ave bracelets oh my god they are
so sweet I'm definitely gonna put this
on today will be really itinerate that
the Damien reception at 8:30 it's 8 to
25 now of course it is it's like a
lanyard as well which I think might be a
bit of a giveaway of what we're doing
today I think this might be all the
points we're going to oh my god a
surprise itinerary day we have a limo we
were told it was like a low-key day but
the girlfriend oh my God look at this
uber XL have really stepped it up today
this is so American I love this
I've got me some french toast we've got
some hot dogs got more french toast
sausage
we've just got to our next what we are
going to go I believe top the rock
observation decks we're gonna get the
best view ever to start
but although I oh my god that is big
building all the way up there
so we just went to the top of the rock
what did you think it's amazing my ears
hurt properly
now we're gonna do some wandering around
shopping I think we're just at Starbucks
right now I've introduced everyone to
strawberries I and my got everyone I'm
always filming better the trader
near Suboxone
try this rumor is I is amazing
we've just arrived oh my god is that
zoomed in I don't know anyway we were at
the Central Park it's really really
exciting and also there's a dog look how
cute he is
that guy tries to tell everyone that
that was Justin Bieber's dog but don't I
have actually believe that show me
Justin Bieber not believe it bring out
the babes we're in the park now and it
is beautiful my favorite part about this
is that there's dogs everywhere oh my
god that's a bit better so fun fact I'm
actually coming to New York for New
Year's Eve this year so can be a little
bit cold still rolling out there with
Nick but we'll have to do ice-skating
instead for sure I've just met so many
amazing people
we'll have to do ice-skating instead
that was Lucy so lovely meeting so many
people as well every network is so sweet
when they so hard I let you like them
nicest people it's insane I was just
saying like in the UK it's very rare
that people say hi because you're so
polite they just don't want to like
interrupt but hear like oh my god it's
like a little Ryan Gosling moment here
right now I don't know what's happening
here but it looks oh my god it's a
picnic oh my god this is my ideal thing
with parks and picnics I'm like yes oh
my God look at this bread guys hello my
love's I am just finishing up getting
ready for tonight I'm just doing my toys
and stuffed night it's so super exciting
because we're gonna go eat at Beauty &amp;amp;
Essex which is like the most unreal
amazing restaurant in New York so the
best thing about it is that it looks
just like a jewelry shop like a pawn
shop but it's actually like a restaurant
which is behind like a hidden door which
I think it's just so cool it is so
amazing when you watch ones that I have
dressed up for the occasion tonight
because it actually is our last dinner
tonight which is so so so sad this is
seriously made like one of the best
trips it's been like such a nice chilled
pace as well which is just perfect
exactly what we need and also no one's
like to burn out or anything like that
so it's just been amazing and the it
team are just like the best like I have
gained so much respect for them after
this trip just because they are so that
is so refreshing to have them in our
beauty community and all the things they
stand for they are more about embracing
who you are and just you know enhancing
certain floors rather than masking them
and I really
that so I really love that because I
feel these days I'm a lot more kind of
like obviously not right now I can
wearing a full way to makeup but I try
my best to kind of enhance myself rather
than hide myself when it comes to makeup
and you'll see like on my Instagram page
you know more like not as often not my
more Posey shots and a lot more kind of
like I got sangria on my nipple so I'm
gonna show you that kinda shots I just
want to be like real again you know no
more this kind of posies you see it
everywhere and it's like I mean it's fun
to do pose every now and then but
sometimes it's just like I don't want to
sue um how am I gonna show you my outfit
I don't know I might have to take you
off and show you I'm gonna put one
smelly pee and I'll show you what I'm
wearing tonight this is my outfit for
tonight is just really really really
nice and girly it has pockets oh my god
has pockets these trousers really from I
think these are from Miss Selfridge my
shoes are from in the style and my top
is like a really really old one from
like misguided failure because I can
actually see the back of myself in this
mirror so I'm trying to see if it's like
working so I think I am good to go right
now I'm so excited to go to feed in
Essex I'm gonna grab my bag and then
we're gonna go have a lasted I got
Luther last another tomorrow I'm
actually going to film a bit of stuff
