have filmed get ready with me because
I'm heading out tonight which is a very
rare occasion but I thought I would film
putting on my makeup so came out was to
like Bert Brown matte look for you I
really hope you guys enjoy it and
without further ado let's get into it
headband is on so I don't really know
what I want to do today and I woke up
this one with like a really slow and I
on this side like here's all swollen and
I don't know why it's just the one time
I'm finally going out and what kind of
puffy eyes eggs like I feel like doing
Browns today so feel free to get ready
with me we'll keep this nice and chill
and chatty so go ahead and get straight
into it so that get the primer on comes
with some music on I'm really quietly in
the background so Gracie is my forehead
where the prime is my Kat Von D lock it
primer
thingamajig oh I'm going to rub it all
over my face and I really don't think I
should be putting makeup
I don't like pollen are today but I'm
just transformative this is this is how
my items might explode or something I
forgot to wear my Beauty Blender year
back crisis photos Beauty Blender is wet
so the foundation I'm using my trusty
Urban Decay all knife and nation in the
shade spice light well start with
humming it onto my face directly using
my Beauty Blender and blending it in as
you guys have seen five million times on
YouTube before just blend this into our
skin I'm like super turned this is
really to business funny because like I
don't really go out that often I don't
really enjoy going out anymore like when
I was younger I used to go out all the
time and by going out I mean like
nightclubs and stuff like that like I
don't my bars but my clothes it's just
so intense there is like how can people
do this every weekend I'm what stood out
for that last
you know like an old grandma with my
Netflix and we're dog now
good seriously today the aim is me to be
like super cake face I want to be like I
am going to fill in my hairline because
it's looking nice and tasty and what
now that we are caked up it's time to
put on a second magical guests will
consider I'm using sad but you will
never guess it you your II need to do
your you but I put on my tart shake take
this one is in a bush I bet now I'm
gonna grab a wet wipe baby wipe wipe all
this gunk off well Liz oh yeah
so my browser looking like this on
vacation wherever they go on I'm going
to use my eyebrow eyebrow Joe I'm safe
and I'm quite sure that's all it says
like house on the packaging doesn't
match you have a name I know it from
Oprah and you can't use my color journey
30 pathetic turnoff just saying feel the
top lip sweating already this is not
good I do have a full eyebrow routine on
my channel if you'd like to see that in
more detail but I'm just very quickly
I'm looking a bit less like an early now
on my breath I'm going to grab my
benefit reading set brow just to make
sure they sustain later look that's
around with me or not now I'm going to
take a very nice
pressed powder in Beach and I'm going to
pop this all of my face to set all of
the skin makeup and make it look a lot
more matte and Nolan
now eyes today I really should've done
like that cause half of these eyeshadows
are already smashed but today I feel
like doing something Brown something
kind of like smokey on the bottom kind
of nude on the top so I am going to use
some single shadows I'll let you know
exactly what they are the first thing I
do is this one called Morocco which is a
makeup peak shape I'm going to use a
sigma e25 blending brush as well come on
focus
I believe in you with a super light hand
and we've got like five million times
I'm going to the rest of that sentence
should just be get really mad because my
camera cut out halfway through that
thank you
lucky I haven't started this I yet so
I'll just demonstrate again why I did
using a very light hand
I'm just very high up going to do some
windscreen wiper motions and then using
that same shape slightly blended in and
then got offers as well and then what I
did next as I grab the cocoa bear which
is a makeup geek shade shade shadow as
well I'm using this on a fluffy Mac 2 to
4 brush and now I'm going to go a little
bit lower than the Morocco shade and use
the same kind of emotion as the whole
side side organize everything I just
can't keep on are still in I'm like
touching my eyes
so we're guys teasing Morocco again very
lightly with the big blending brush such
a little hotel let me take a burnt
orange mat from Australia and Beverly
Hills go and put it on
so that it won't create anything like
that be honest I think I might leave the
eyes like this kind of you like we're
anything like it Matt for my life and I
think it's expected with any like two
colors but it's pretty like now we're
going to move on to mascara and I'm just
going to curl my lashes first quickly
I'm going to take the benefit roller
lash we still want to focus but that's
okay and we're going to go and just
apply a light coat to say I'm going to
be putting on salty as I'm going out
tent excuse we're folding and I'm sure
there'll be many people to comment
saying Danny all your makeup looks are
the same but this is a get ready with me
it no store also gonna get ready with me
I put on the makeup but I want to wear
that suits me so it might look the same
as all the tutorials but its second
I do have hundreds of those terms of our
channel if you don't want to watch this
kind of show play what though I think
that is the most common comment you ever
see on any makeup video ever any makeup
YouTube are always top commenters all
your looks are the same it's like if I'm
watching someone's makeup tutorial and I
don't like the makeup with the colors
they're using anything I just stop
watching and then the problem is solved
with Steven sectors like I want to feel
like I get ready is going out clearly
shadow go
I've also like it'd be really fun to
film this and also all should I like do
it in a different ways that people don't
get upset that similar smile just oral
dress look it to get ready with me I
should be doing what I want to do you
know I'm really watching this like burn
out warm smoky looking nice
I just don't how like it's only my two
eyeshadows as well just perfect it today
I'm going to use my lashes in wild baby
just like the perfect clubbing lashes
businesslike
I am so here's how they look there's
like no band at all it's like invisible
so it looks super natural as well love
it I'll leave them in my description
Monday where some Danny beautiful
eyelashes can be very appreciative
because he's like my babies I love them
so much
it's not time to be my favorite
definition I'm going to use the benefit
hoola bronzer on my cheeks today on my
sticker super dry skin oh I'm gonna
apply this lightly and add more as it
goes my new what lip color is to look
the best like a brownie darkness I like
those actually also starting this video
so I'm going to do wing Donna and a red
lip so that kind of went out I'm not
wearing this combat by the way I have
like fresh tan on I think I'm wearing
white tonight I was like that's a
disaster waiting to happen I think I'm
cursed
if I wear what or any color except like
actually when I'm applying makeup I
always blow myself like guaranteed but
if I'm wearing black I give a pseudo
myself boys with the patch anything oh I
was going for white line here don't know
why do you guys find like there's little
areas on your skin that make up so it
doesn't stick to your like why are you
being so weird like just call basically
okay could I control my nose now
basically
scrapping the natural shape outlet I got
my brushes so clean this is so
resonating I'm going to see Oprah bun
and a buzzer and I'm going to this
underneath my eyes to make sure that
they move not creased now I'm going to
from the highlight whoo the good part
this is the exciting part I'm going to
use the over as a glow highlight and I'm
going to kind of just like mix my brush
and golden because obviously time to
finish it off with lipsticks especially
I'm going to use my Urban Decay all
nighter spray and then absolutely wrench
myself in 2000 years later when I was
over you oh my face is wet my face so
where's this better last all day I swear
to God looking like a possessed demon
then take a risk and using Mac and
makeup lipstick that I've never used
before to make Matt Hughes committed
because this dude

little bit this is get it by tot eh yeah
