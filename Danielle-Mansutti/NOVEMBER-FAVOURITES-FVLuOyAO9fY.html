doing a favorites video today in a kind
of different style the normal this isn't
going to be more about makeup as it is
about like my favorite things of
November like these are the things that
I am just like in love with and they
aren't all beauty related November has
been a crazy month my birthday I got my
puppy very crazy was such a good month
and these are the things that have made
me really happy in the month of November
the first product is a sponsored product
which I was sent and have fallen in love
with and you guys know I would never
ever ever sponsor any product which I
didn't believe in myself because it's
done wonders for my hair this is the
L'Oreal ever pure repair and defend
advanced haircare so here they are the
beautiful products which honestly have
done wonders to me what I love the most
about this they are self a free everyone
that is really interested in here and
stuff know that sulfate free means oh
yeah give me some of that literally it's
so good you're like sulfites and
apartments most my stuff is like it's
like a hundred percent sulfite free
tyrunt free die free it's vegan as well
the ever pure self eight free products
are not abrasive and gentle that perfect
for color or chemically treated hair
like my someone like hair like me big
breasts
perhaps yes breast fetish up Scheffer
it's super gentle and what's so good
because as you guys know I do have color
treated hair and it doesn't strip the
color at oh it's really good as well
because we all know kind of brassy it
that one can get this helps all those
ones as well so my next favorite for
this month is being myself
getting back into running bugging so I
have recently restarted a journal and
I've also
restarted my blog but those of you that
have followed me from the time when
I used to keep up with my riding and
stuff like that I have revived
everything hey did anyone say you don't
come I'm going to be blogging it's my
new website basically if you've watched
with the truth video you'll sort of know
what I'm talking about but for a long
time I lost the credit side of myself
and I thought people would judge me for
it because it's what I got boy for
through high school was for being like
oh babe you know there's always like
painting in a corner and stuff like that
when I thought screw it now I'm gonna
stop talking again thought I can't
people gonna gossip about it like
scrutinize everything that I write I'm
gonna write what I want because I can
and we all are allowed to do what we
want so yeah I've decided to restart my
blog and I'm so happy that I did I feel
like all my creative juices are flowing
my favorite candle of the month is this
cactus blossom candle from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works spot the body works finally opened
up and movin I'm so happy about it we
don't get a ranger scooter - you guys
get in the u.s. and these candles are so
expensive in Australia compared to the
u.s. oh but this smells amazing and I
wish that you guys had smell it because
oh it's so good my favorite book of the
month is for agreements this book is
just a lot about like enlightenment and
freedom and it's just something so
different than I normally read and it's
obviously not so much of the big
radiance it's very easy to get there as
well it just really opened your mind to
a new thing if you ever see this in a
bookstore just get it I don't want to
like tell you too much about it because
you'll really
my next favorite is being related oh I
recruit coast medics I'm like the
current favorite of mine they're like my
favorite brand of the month and these
are my favorite products by upper
Cosmetics right now I love that our
shadows as well but they don't like
single pans and I just thought it'd be
easiest to show you three for the parts
that I'm actually wearing stead which
every single day that I've wore makeup
this month I've used these three
products in my face as well I really
love Oprah like I love them I met the
company when I was over in LA and I just
really really really love what this for
and everything like that like they're a
great company and they create amazing
quality products as well so we recently
connected a girl like sent me a bunch of
products and I do have a discount code
for Oprah which is Danny 30 and it gives
you 30% off their products which is
amazing and you should definitely use it
because it is such a good deal
this is Oprah's banana powder as you can
see I'm out of town as you guys know
I've been using this underneath my eyes
just like in this little triangle here
and it is seriously being incredible for
me my other favorite is the art bra
Beverly Hills highlighter as you can see
it is the most beautiful pen it means I
wrote I am wearing it on my cheekbone
today because I was so big different
colors in the pan it creates such a
beautiful color effect on your cheekbone
on your highlight it it's just amazing I
than any other highlight looks like this
and this is now like my go-to Violeta
but I've been using every single day
that I will make up this month and I've
had a lot of compliments about it as
well which makes me feel very happy
my last start from Oprah is there
americana bronzer again I'm wearing it
today it is so good it is now my goatee
bronzer it is a really beautiful shade
it is slow blendable and just so easy to
use which makes me so happy because too
often do is run so that can't like I
just mean muddling with face but as you
can see this is just a really really
really beautiful soft bronzer which I
love every so much should go and have
music
I knows as well it's amazing I love it
raving about it I brought that awesome
and if you don't get these products
remember to use 1030 because of what you
guys have saved money and it's really
good really good products think you
should get them hashtag Ross wants it
but it's really lovin like the my last
favorite is so random while I kind of
felt like I should share because it has
been like a favorite favorite of mine
and kind of changed my hell up and away
it's almond milk isn't that really
random a lot of you have seen it can
keep up with my snapchat to keep up with
my Borov loves stuff like that
i whinge all the time about being
bloated like old Doug I had a lot of
people tell me you know it could be
gluten it could be this it could be that
a lot of my followers and a lot of
nutritionists stuff that I'm swaggin to
you have all told me that almond milk is
really good
I get the unsweetened one because I
started like tracking the nutrients in
my free that I was eating on like My
Fitness Pal a little while ago and it
really opened my eyes to how much sugar
was in some foods that I never thought
was I used to always drink semi skim
milk which I believe was like 2% fat
whatever in America and there's too much
sugar in it I was like what what I just
couldn't believe it so much as much
sugar was coming from the milk that I
was drinking and every time when I drank
milk all of a sudden I had a food baby I
was she's bloated I felt really gross I
felt really groggy and really happy
I just felt loved I made the switch I
bought some almond milk that my
nutritionist at the time recommended to
me and I have it I absolutely hated it I
put it in my cereal I was like this is
disgusting I put it in my tape this is
disgusting I'm like it just tastes like
really cold water it has no flavor it's
crap on my block and then I stuck to it
I waited for about a week or sorry and
started using it every single day and
slowly but surely I began to really love
it because I didn't have that grogginess
and that horrible feeling after it and I
just felt so much better
than I did with the old milk that I used
to drink so I haven't cut out dairy
completely or anything like that
obviously there'll be times were silly
Pizza what does cheese or nighttime so
goodnight drink hot chocolate which has
normal milk in it but when it comes to
me going into the supermarket making the
choices for myself I definitely don't
look anymore because it made me feel so
like it's just helped me personally with
my diet my bloating like don't eat this
and stuff like that so it's been really
really helpful for me it's a favorite of
mine this month because it has made me
feel better and I can't give up or dairy
because I am a chocolate addict but at
least I'm making good choices when it
comes to what dairy I'm drinking now
I definitely feel changing myself and
will definitely recommend if you feel a
bit oh when you drink milk to try on the
milk the brand that I use is the
sanitarium so good at all we milk it is
the unsweetened one it has full star
health rating sanitarium you should get
me on your ads because I'm all about
this and just like and those are my
favorite things of November I hope you
enjoyed this video and enjoys how it was
a little bit different and sense of my
favorite things of the month let's gonna
pick up my favorite beauty products a
