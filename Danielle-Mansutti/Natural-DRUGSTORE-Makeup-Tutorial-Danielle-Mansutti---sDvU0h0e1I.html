doing my everyday sort of drugstore more
natural makeup look I have done an
everyday makeup look in the past when I
had no idea how to apply makeup today I
want to show you guys what I actually do
on a jungle day since back to go into
the shots or something more casual this
is what I do I don't go crazy pressed
powders and eyelashes and contouring and
stuff this is just more of my natural
everyday look I really hope you do enjoy
this tutorial though because I had a lot
of fun filming it and I'm gonna get
straight into it today so I'm going to
be starting off with a BB cream I'm
using the chichi
super BB cream and I think that a good
project for this one if you can't get
Chi Chi in your country is the Guardian
baby cream and of course I'm using my
dirty little Real Techniques sponge and
so I'm just going to put baby cream
straight onto the sponge I'm gonna I've
absolutely fallen in love with baby
creams especially for summer which I'm
going through right now
just because it's such an easy things
when it gives the illusion to me just
having really nice glowy skin so you can
see kind of difference between the two
these sides on this side it's just with
the one pump of the BB cream so I
haven't done my forehead yet but you can
see that it's blending into my neck and
then this side is looking a bit sad like
cuz I'm looking back on my own everyday
makeup tutorial and I'm just watching it
I don't put on that much makeup every
single day this is more my everyday
thing I don't really like to wear a lot
of makeup every day because it makes my
face like feel like I'm drowning or
something in the makeup if I have lots
and lots of makeup on and I shudder for
the entire day I literally just want to
like scrape it off do you guys ever feel
like that you just wanna get it off
survives and my baby cream is on and I'm
going to start off by actually doing the
scarf as a lot of you know that I cannot
stand looking at myself with no mascara
on and I just feel like an alien so I'm
just gonna curl my eyelashes and I hold
it down for five seconds and I'm using
my essence I love extreme volume mascara
it is very cheap only about five dollars
or something and I'm just using this on
my lashes and just applying it in this
sort of Wiggly motion another tip as
well is to sort of go off and inwards
because I used to go outwards and I did
actually make my eyelashes look quite
flat so yeah I personally feel like this
makes a huge difference to my face next
I'm gonna get some little spider
allergens going on with a very thin one
Scout is the chuchi
really a magic lash and I'm just going
to apply this very very delicately to my
bottom lashes next I'm gonna fill in my
brows I am using a light brown eye
pencil a little circle chichi cuz I keep
in this dress taller and I'm going to
fill in just this part of my eyebrow
here I don't touch the front oh good
today I went to get my eyebrows Tintin
and threaded and the woman that just
have no time for me and she was Roth's
and my eyebrows like really red and
soulless
I'm sorry that looks really weird if you
guys know it's Charlie that we have in
the middle of the shopping center we
have sometimes like I breath 13 places
and I just went there and this woman was
working myself but had about four or
five people waiting and when I went to
sit down she was just like are my
eyebrows no like oh my god
my eyebrows mean everything to me please
don't I go home with like run upstairs
and like tweeze them in right show that
there was normal again so now that I
filled in my brows I'm 98 brow sculpting
gel this is from Otto and it looks
disgusting
it used to be clean up but mmm yummy I'm
just using this to just hold my brows in
place good day I just like doing this
after I lightly fill my brows otherwise
you get those little stray hairs
everywhere and it looks like what now
I'm just a little bit of concealer I'm
using the instant age rewind the
Maybelline instant age rewind concealer
section like yeah and he just sort of
makes me look a bit more awake in I
guess yeah I'm taking the same sponge as
before and I'm just going to Pat this in
and blend it all out
now if I was going to go to like the
shops or just something very quick
I would leave as I am now but if I
wanted to make this a bit more
long-lasting throughout the day because
I do find that the BB cream does rub off
quite a lot I'm going to use this AC on
tour contouring part there's some banana
Theory guys oh I'm just going to pop a
tiny bit on my brush and just put it
over the same area where I put the
concealer just because I find that this
helps to make it more long-lasting and
just hold out throughout the day because
I just find if I don't place a powder
over the top it can just easily rub off
and just doesn't look very attractive
don't really feel the need to contour so
we're not going to contour today instead
I'm just gonna grab a little bit of an
empty bronzer and I'm using the Real
Techniques multitask brush I'm just
gonna dip this in my bronzer a little
bit and just pop a little bit around my
cheeks just for a little bit of color
otherwise just having the baby cream and
that's it on my face can look a bit
boring and make my face look like why
okay so the last step is completely
optional so I just like to grab a lip
liner which matches my lip color and
just place it on my top lip and this
just helps to let my lips and
so that's it guys this is my go-to sort
of more natural everyday makeup this is
what I do most most of the time I don't
go crazy with eyelashes violation and
pressed powders and other stuff every
day and contouring every day this is
more after at the house kind of makeup
so I really hope that you enjoyed
today's tutorial please let me know we
did and I'll be seeing you really soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
