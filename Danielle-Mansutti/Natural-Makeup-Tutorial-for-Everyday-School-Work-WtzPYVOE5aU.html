in today's gear I have a very natural
glowy makeup look to share with you if
you like me and you want to change that
I'm totally natural beauty I'm not
running like ten products on my face
look I know you have to do is keep
watching if you aren't already subscribe
to my channel I put up two new videos
every single week and all you have to do
is press that big fat red
Saraiva button down below to be part of
the family so without further ado mr. so
today I'm going to start with the it
cosmetics CC cream and this one is in
the shade light when I'm having more
like a known makeup natural day I always
produce CC or BB creams rather than
foundation because I feel like the
minute I put on foundation I just your
whole face I was like who have you
makeup like oh I'm just going to use a
sponge and I did have a spray tan hence
why my face is very orange but hopefully
this will still match my skin you can
see it just makes a slight difference
from my natural skin to the CC cream and
that's why I love this little look that
I'm aiming for and I do natural makeup
if you know the whole are you wearing
makeup
or you just naturally you don't hook
your like friendly wearing like 70
products on my face right now you're
just comparing that side to this size
you can see it's a very natural light
coverage which is exactly what we want
today
and if you're after more of a natural
finish as well with your in makeup that
I definitely recommend using a sponge
instead of a brush I always find that
using a sponge just makes the product
look for skin like or as using a brush
makes it look a bit heavier in the
sponge that I'm using is from Africa
weddings but I also recommend a sponge
from Beauty Blender as well because they
are that oh now I'm going to use my
heart shaped head concealer and this one
is in the shade light/medium honey and
I'm going to pop a little bit under my
eyes and nowhere else I just like to do
under my eyes personally but you can do
it down your nose on your chin when I'm
a bit too lazy for that on my natural
day it's good to go like in a little
triangle shape so I find from the end of
your nose
upwards and then along and then down was
the best coverage so doing it just and
make your eyes and some of my brows
today I was in the benefit Corral and
this one is in the shade for and I have
recently uploaded a in-depth eyebrow
tutorial if you want to see it in more
detail I'll leave it link below so my
camera she's being very cheeky and
decided to stop recording halfway
through a clip thanks camera but oh you
missed this side I'm using the Too Faced
Sun bunny bronzer I'm using this on my
cheeks and this stuff is like a golden
oldie of mine I absolutely love it so
I'll just put on a little bit more so as
you can see what I did is I just sort of
grown an L shape so I work it downward
upwards and up to my temples I just do
the continuous motion until I get the
bronzed look that I'm after and the
reason why we want to apply some bronzer
to our face is that if you apply like
just a CC cream or just a foundation
your face can kind of look like a bit of
a blog if you don't have any dimension
in it so just by adding some contour to
your cheeks new temples it will kind of
slim your face a little bit provide
extra shape and just looks great
and the reason why I'm using this Sun
body bronzer today is because it's glowy
and I'm asked like a match
sunkissed glow so some money is perfect
for this and I my supernatural dies I
don't contour my nose because ain't
nobody got time for that I'm just going
to use my Oprah banana powder and I'm
going to apply this underneath my eye
just for a little bit of added coverage
because we are using a very light
coverage six step CC cream today so I
thought tomatoes well go in and add some
extra coverage and I'm sweating on my
top lip during my life I always feel
like I look kind of like an alien who
got my mascara on so we're going to go
ahead and put that on quickly so I'm
just going to quickly tell my lashes
this is a really naughty eyelash curler
it's from taut
I think thank you with a benefit roller
lash mascara I'm just going to pop this
on my top lashes only I'm going to leave
my bottom lashes alone when I want to
look natural so I was going to very
lightly apply this so I like to apply
mascara wand on my eye and then give it
a bit of a wiggle and then work my way
at the top and I find that this provides
the most amount of mascara on her lashes
and I also blink when I apply my mascara
as well
Oh mascara is on I'm going to use the
two-faced sweet peach blue palette and
we're just going to start with this
peachy blushed in the middle and put
this on the apples of my cheeks as well
so do a little to smile you can find it
an add color to your cheeks and then
using this highlight shade from the
palette I'm going to put this on my now
also a little bit gamma nose also on my
Cupid's bow and I'm going to take the
urban decay lip liner in ex-girlfriend
which was the deep cleanse defining
collaboration I'm going to outline my
lips and then go in with some lip balm
or lip gloss in the middle so no oh I
think it's got what she wasn't very
lipstick just lip liner
I just decided that wasn't working for
me somebody's the colour-pop BFF two
liner instead the other line I just
looked is nothing I was like what
which is weird can you selectively
welcome me and I'm going to go on the
inside a little bit a little bit when
I'm just taking a lip balm this one is
the autopilot overnight lip balm by
Napoleon hoodie and I'm going to just
pop this over the lip liner so this is a
clear lip balm and it just helps to
smooth out the liner and also ensure
that it's sankar all over your lips as
well and then not even ten minutes later
the makeup is done so it's like natural
as in like yes my resident yes err
mascara on yes my cheeks glowing but I
woke up like this so I hope that you
