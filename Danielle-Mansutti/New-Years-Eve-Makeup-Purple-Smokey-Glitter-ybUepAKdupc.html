channel today I've created this really
glittery purple dramatic look which I
think will be perfect for it news or any
occasion similar to that don't you for
jump straight into the tutorial well let
you guys know that I'm currently daily
vlogging on my vlogging channel I'm
doing the 12 days it's love I don't mean
the world to me if you guys would jump
over there and subscribe to help me up
also I'm going to England Wednesday so
excited but what I have in England I'll
be spending storage time with family
that will be two weeks so it will be
only a Friday upload just so that I have
a lot of time to spend quality time with
like my grandparents and stuff like that
and I'll be back to Tuesday and Friday
uploads from there onwards but without
further ado let's jump straight into
this tutorial we're starting with a soft
okay luan up pro longwear Paint Pot for
our eyes great start on the voice over
there I'm just using this to prime my
eyes blue eye shadow and setting it with
a light eye shadow of the top then using
some scotch tape I'm gonna use this so
that we have a nice crisp clean line for
our eye shadow definitely recommend it
i'm using the morphe brushes palette in
35s today and i'm starting with this
gorgeous pink color I'm just putting it
in my crease and I'm using it as my
transition shade for today
next using this purple shade I'm going
to use this on my outer part of my lid
and also in my crease to darken things
up a little bit and make it a bit
dramatic and I'm also gonna go back in
with the light pink from before and also
keep blending it through so that they
have a really nice gradient going on as
well now this black black black black
shade I was so scared to do this but it
turned out fine
don't worry about the blacks mercy we're
gonna go over it with glitter anyway
it's completely fine so I just wanted to
go to the top of my crease and not touch
that purple and pink part and instead
just grab a big fluffy brush and blend
it all together instead next I'm using
this Mac glitter and I'm using the fixed
bus spray on my brush to ensure that it
will stick on there and I'm packing it
on my lid oh my god that fallout is
insane that's why I did my face makeup
second but how gorgeous is this pigment
it's so pretty so I'm just packing that
all over wipe with the black and making
sure it's blending into the crease as
well how satisfying is removing the tape
ah amazing then I'm just applying a
little bit of mascara over the top I
didn't wear falsies I just didn't really
feel like it but you can definitely do
it if you want now I'm using the
covergirl outlast stay fabulous
foundation in golden tan and opponents
of my face you guys have seen me do this
a million times
and I'm also dragging it down to my neck
next with the it cosmetics Baba
under-eye concealer I'm using the light
one underneath my eyes and then I'm
blending out with my big Zowie about
buffer brush and setting it with a and
makeup forever
powder as well I'm using the Rimmel stay
matte powder for my entire face today so
I'm just popping this on my whole face
yeah
now with this Sigma medium brow powder
I'm using this to fill in my brows just
very lightly I didn't want to go too
overboard but I just kind of left the
front part of my brows alone and just
filled in the tail and don't forget to
set it with an eyebrow gel it makes such
a big difference seriously I used the
Bahama Mama bronzer on my cheeks on my
temples my forehead and my chin I just
went crazy with it because it's New
Year's so why not take a couple minute
we're using the hot mama blush from the
balm as well and I'm just putting this
on the apples of my cheeks
now using Becca champagne pop whoa love
it as you guys know I'm obsessed with
this product I'm using this as my
highlighter with a fan brush and I'm so
obsessed I also put a little bit down my
nose just to make it look scary and then
I use the little light pink shade from
before and apply this to my lower lash
line this helped the Ã¬look blend so
well by putting it in my lower lash line
I also blended it with the really crisp
straight line we have on the side just
to make sure that it's all blended
together
then I just put a coat of raoul ash on
my bottom lashes
I use the spice a lip pencil from Mac on
my lips just align them before we put on
the lip product I started off with dusty
lilac lip gloss from Anastasia Beverly
Hills but I was not very sure it looked
a little bit yeah in my opinion so I
actually went over it with potion
instead and this created a much darker
more dramatic nice just wolf look and
that was the finished look
so I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial
and I hope you have a brilliant me is
