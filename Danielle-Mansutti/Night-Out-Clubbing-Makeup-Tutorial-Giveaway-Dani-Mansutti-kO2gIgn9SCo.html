what have you didn't prepare me entirely
at a guy out so I thought I would film
my getting ready process and it's super
exciting because I recently received the
multi adjustment Hill palette I'm and

person on YouTube to use this and I was
like I really want to use that new video

details for that without further ado
let's get into it so we are going to get
Saturday with if you Jacqueline your
palate never as much ever been used
before their go to constitute is through
so gorgeous and I am so excited my eyes
are looking at this corner I want to
play with these blues and probably like
this orange voted on my eyebrows but
we'll start with the eyes and then we'll
do the face and then also so close
because color cosmetics except me a
bunch of the birthday at collection of
lipsticks let's get started primal
eyelids I'm going to use the Urban Decay
eyeshadow primer potion now I'm just
going to take a light color from the
palette to set that
crema I'm folks are going to mix these
two shades up here for my crease I
actually haven't watched too many
tutorials using this which is good
because I had like a clean idea of what
I want to do without having to think
about anyone else or how I get it or
anything like that so I'm going to be as
you probably already seen from the
sellers video I want to create like a
really aqua kind of eye but have this
sense of warfare at the top as well so
far these the shadows are literally
blending like a dream morphe always has
like the best quality and last part like
this have so many options because
they're just palettes you can use all
the time I mean anything is it's not
very travel friendly because it's big
and bulky but if you are someone that
applies makeup every single weekend like
me it's great I'm going to take this
really deep red shade and super lightly
super lightly going to put this just
underneath that color to give it a
little bit more depth in the literature
blending oh nice way yeah finally
that's good palette you can already tell
that I'm going to use it so much because
they are slow but many warm shades and
you guys know how difficult it was for
me not to just feel like a warm red
smoky eye today because I knew everyone
will be like daddy no I just said I
looked much younger I did some or
anything but I put on my Instagram and
it's in my hate list hairstyles video
and I did something where I had like
warm on the top and then cool to animal
lid and we're going to go like it's
weird I ain't come at halos on the outer
corner inner corner of my eye and I miss
it this in the middle of your eyes
and I got my blending brush again and
just blend that into my crease
I'm taking that matte color grams to add
to the end
you can't you've lost any of that color
follow this brushes from color pulpit so
good
color brushes are the wrong guys the
worst things happen let me get my side
I'm gonna show you my brush sweat of
course I would do that handle people I
would do that I'm going to take a white
quickly and just remove any excess so I
think that warm shades that we use
before and I'm just going to add a
little bit more to the outer corner now
I'm going to apply some a roller lash to
ice boots on any illusion I'm not going
to use my iPhone is in Asmara I'm going
to public on my lashes he's gonna look
so dramatic and so pretty I can't like
see how they complement to look
okay finally I'm not concentrating it's
hot we can finally have a chitchat whoa
hey guys how are you
Holliday have you been how do you like
all that stuff I'm using the urban decay
on either foundation to do because I'm
going to have it all nighter yeah not
this one issues perfect for clubbing
because there's no flashback it lasts
literally or not and it's incredible and
it's waterproof
I just realized I've never liked so I'm
sorry now you can see my face really and
so for my concealer I'm not going to use
the Tarte shape tape because I use it
every single video so we're going to use
the color pop this is light neutral 16
at the car pop concealer which is
actually really good considering it's
like $6 or components vintage tube right
now I honestly find it quite similar to
shape to shape tip is the balm we all
know detective is like the lovers the
contributor really good I'm using with
Smashbox photo-finish powder it's weird
isn't it it's like you always have
phases with youtubers like oh there's no
youtuber I think that I've watched
forever like every single upload never
miss one kind of thing because I just
find that there's times where you love
one youtuber just because it looks like
your own personal preference it's just
like stuff that you want to see or
whatever and there's times we're just
like oh I can't really love watching
that and rather watch someone else and
it's funny how we do that isn't it
because I reviewer as well as the
Creator so I always find that really
interesting to see why it is that we
sort of bounce between creators so much
and stuff because I never picture the
same person ever
and same with daily vloggers I find it
hard to watch every single one of those
algorithms done so I look for LCS or
check three of his seven balls away -
whatever
but oh that's it I've been watching so
much of in the throat so if you know
Victoria she is from England as well her
content is so good and her blog is so
good because then I recently restarted
my blog which is de Montcalm hits of
inspiration was from Victoria I went on
her blog I was just like wow like using
two different bronzer today Oh God movie
okay golden oldies just grandma draw
Bahama Mama by the barn
you guys remember nice the worst thing
my closet is like literally all of this
year until I moved I didn't really watch
YouTube and you know it wasn't really
into the trends or anything you do not
know was doing but now that I have so
much time on my own
I want youtubers just to put like in the
background just a flick background
always because I was alone it's not just
hear someone talking and that sound so
lovely but I am so lonely you know what
I mean like it's nice to just hear
someone in the house I love playing
blogs in the background where else I'm
not really watching them same with halls
not really watching them but I watch
them to be ended just like someone
talking so what do you guys think what's
your view on YouTube and stuff at the
moment because you seem interesting it's
like I'll be bored doing that not just
me oh yeah definitely way more into like
chatty videos and stuff and I feel like
making chatty videos like if it's not
fun than like a voiceover but thank you
so much for your love on my Game of
Thrones Daenerys transformation by the
way because I was really kind of a bit
unsure about making it and uploading it
because I thought you know no one's
really going to care and everything a
bit weird and a bit like not emotional
content but you guys who sighs the boy
band so lovely and I was just like blown
away the highlight today wheezing the
over up barley highlight a little
beautiful and you can get 30% of Oprah
by using my code Danny
30 at the checkout putting that in there
nice and gradually
this highlights like all that I wear at
the moment is on indicate on our way
because I'm actually going out weird I'm
actually feeling to go out though not to
film take it off straight afterwards I
actually have plans I'm actually going
out there I'm going to use the thesis
ratio that we used before I'm just gonna
click here you can swing it up in a part
of my own we need to ah lower Alicia's
MIT is the Too Faced better than sex for
this today so the Kylee delivery
I received the gorgeous makeup bag which
I'm gonna take like everywhere in me and
I received these jewelry on the inside
and it's so weird because I have never
spoken to Kylie cosmetics I don't know
how to have my English dresses like
websites are good she's between these
and the end is the big one I think I
found the one it is so little itty bitty
tiny it so cute like a lips first with
the birthday liner and then it's the one
which is called one wish I think but if
it's too light or for other ones called
angel which is very similar
right let's see what the color is like I
might go in where angels which is the
sweat okay it's a little bit warmer
darker we'll see like the roads like
glossy as well I'm not too dry into now
it's nice and might put a warm glass of
the top maybe this is a river by Oprah
you look through the top
thank you guys I should speak out or at
the end if you want to all that the good
way then oil to do is keep watching we
