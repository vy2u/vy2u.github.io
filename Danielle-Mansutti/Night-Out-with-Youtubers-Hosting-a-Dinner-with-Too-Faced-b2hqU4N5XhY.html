it's very exciting so as you guys know
la not long ago when I was there to face
and I were discussing me hosting a
dinner in Sydney for youtubers and stuff
like that which is just so cool I
absolutely adore Too Faced as you guys
know today I'm heading off to Sydney and
getting the flight there and I'm
bringing my mom because why not I want
her to sort of see this YouTube world
that I'm in and everything like that and
she said she's going to be my camera
woman thank you mum and tomorrow is the
Too Faced dinner I'm super excited but
as always it's raining in Sydney every
time I go to Sydney it rains I don't
know what that is
and then on Friday I'm thinking about
maybe doing a little bit of a meet-up or
see how we go for time but there's a few
people that I know on Twitter who are so
supportive of me and I'd love to meet
them in person when they live in Sydney
so that'd be really cool and yes so now
I'm off to the airport this is flight 19
of 2016 for me my 19th flight Wow I'm
are only just finishing me
who you here
ain't too shabby mum rightfully and
flora salut if we have to
I just feel like I'm on a boat we feel
very pretty this is lit sure the bees
mirror I've ever seen in a hotel room it
is huge
I'm seriously heading up from Starbucks
now so much
is it nice
it takes us a suite that looks like a
green Pooh weekend so we're enjoying
ourselves all weekend we're heading off
now of course as always I'm in all black
everything do some glittery eye shadow
menu is a soda I can see me but you know
installments
what my staff
by actually drinking check out this
pretty um insulation up there guys we
are operable okay is my part of the
newest
okay it looks so good with the filter
filter makes I know what I was going to
pull Viviana and Danny's log so it kind
of like evened out I said why did you
call me and Danny uncle ugly we are nice
girls
he said because she blocked me after I
made a comment with a typo said no you
left a nasty comment saying she needs a
nose job
which isn't a typo I was meant to say
she doesn't need a no-show
that was the typo miss the word guys
Typho oh my god like three days
I should bring the taxi on the way to
Ivy everybody this is probably the most
outrageous vlog that you've ever seen on
Danny moon so she's like channel but you
know there's a first for everything
crunches mmm goal is to hit Tunes she's
not my idea and key card you guys and my
recent
somehow we have made it to McDonald so

I want everyone so I just got back home
my camera says so apologies about using
my phone I just have to show you guys
how amazing the glue bags were from to
face and how generous they were this is
insane we have a waterproof better than
sex mascara a normal one we have a
little colored here all of the sketchy
marker eyeliners oh my god then we have
these beautiful bronzer and blush then
we have all these melted mats over here
as well I mean whoa and then what I'm
loving is the Born This Way concealer so
they are exactly like the foundations
they're so beautiful and then we also
have these bad boys draw the glossy lip
injection as well look how generous they
be it's insane so I was editing the vlog
before and oh my goodness
Oh funny was all the footage for our
night out in Sydney so funny it's so
weird reading other youtubers because
they are so lovely in person as well not
always exactly the same in person as
you'd expect them to be online it was so
good and Britney is hilarious I love her

amazing time interface thank you guys so
