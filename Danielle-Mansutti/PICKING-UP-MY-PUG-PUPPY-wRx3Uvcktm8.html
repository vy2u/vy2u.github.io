waiting for this day like six or seven
years and I can't believe it's finally
here like I am so excited I want to cry
like I'm just beyond excited right now
and it's got an L I'm gonna be picking
up my hug and I'm just so excited
actually happening it's finally
happening and I'm so happy and so
excited I've been setting up my
apartment to get ready for Benzes
arrival so I've got things like her
little dog bed actually bought some
outfits for her as well I have my little
baby get out for her then we have our
little pee pad a bed some toys and then
I have like a ridiculous amount of pug
stuff okay
so good old beanie I don't know why I'm
calling her veins it's just the name
that I've always liked for a pug since
like forever so I just figured I would
call her beans I think it's really cute
such a coincidence like fate it's just
so lucky as I'm Phil - it was my
birthday yesterday today's the feasts of
November my birthday was on the 4th and
it's just like fate so then about four
weeks ago I met her and this is before
Bora Bora so it's been like so hard to
keep this a secret for you guys but
here's when I met her let me tell it
with brightness this is when I met her
she was so tiny like such a little
poppet look at her oh the only problem
was that she was a lot smaller than the
her litter I think I'm um rejected her
we weren't sure she'd actually make it
or she'd be healthy enough but she said
her vet checks and she's healthy and
she's good to go and I'm so excited to
see you today and pick her up and it
just all came into play so I'm gonna
jump in the car with mom and dad and
we're gonna go over I think that I'm so
excited because I know this is going to
change my life I'm gonna have
responsibility I'm gonna have something
to look after and walk it's gonna give
me so much happiness and it's just yeah
it's gonna be absolutely life-changing
and I'm just so excited for
how much gonna benefit me and how much
I'm gonna fall in love with her and have
a little bit of a best friend to live
with them so that I'm just obviously
gonna be documenting everything that she
does today so yeah I think you guys
along I hope you're as excited I am and
