because I am going to create tomorrow
the day you watching this is the day
that I'm filming this as well so on
Friday I'm going to create with me
buzzing we're excited I've just
literally allowed in my cell phone I
think ten minutes you can date I'm going
to show you exactly how I am everything
for holiday in a carry-on
it looks really sweet this is what I use
for like four day trips so I'm going to
be sharing all my tips and tricks I've
learned over last year's traveling a lot
not only how to save space but also just
help when you're packing process and
just before we do a jump straight into
the video it would mean in the absolute
world to me if you aren't subscribed to
my video to hit that big red button down
below but also hit the bell because
youtubers make and get so hard for us
right now if you don't have a
notification bell on my videos won't
always come up in your sub box if you
could hit that Bell for me I will love
you forever he is a normal kind of
overview of what I do before I actually
pax there's a little process beforehand
where this pile is like the outfits I'm
going to wear in the evening that I have
my gym wear bikinis and then day wear
and then I've got like toiletries
electrical passport and international
plug is probably the most important of
all that said don't forget your passport
let's combine everything into this
little bad boy I think the most
important thing that you guys should do
is make a packing list so I make a
packing list for every trip that I have
before I go so I know exactly what to
put in but also to review it when you
are leaving so you know that everything
is in your suitcase and you're not gonna
leave anything behind so this is my
little carry-on bag that I will be
taking with me I got this on a trip with
NYX and it's really really light like
honestly the bag weighs absolutely
nothing which is perfect as you guys can
see I have a lot of white clothing that
I'm taking away with me and what I need
to tell you which is such a game-changer
is that with oil what cutting it or
taking turn it inside out just think if
anything spills in the bag it means at
the front of it weren't
staying hopefully and the same goes for
shoes and stuff obviously with dirty
shoes being so close to your clothes
it's just better more hygienic to
actually turn every item of white
clothing inside out and when it comes to
packing your clothes I can't recommend
enough to roll them and lay them side to
side don't never stack them like this
like just fold one until the other
because it will waste so much space in
your suitcase and also create creasing
so it's going to lay this out flat
animart you're gonna roll this one quite
tight the t-shirt are quite loose but
this one will be very tight because this
does crease really easily and the
tighter that I roll this the less
creasing or how so just like that we
have these trousers it's such a small
cylinder so my clothes and I laid out
and they are rolled I do have two pairs
of shorts and I would say wear denim
denim is really annoying to roll anyway
so we're denim I do prefer to just put
them in black I do find that this
actually saves the most space because
rolling them folding them which is
create so much thickness
I'll just ladies in there like that and
then with the clothing I'm just gonna
start with the really thick ones on the
bottom and we can add the smaller ones
to the top so anything with a lot of
thickness and there's a bit bulky I'm
just gonna pop like this so they all go
side to side and there's now another
layer on the top of them as well so I'm
just gonna pop on the top all the sort
of thinner more t-shirt kind of style
stuff at this point I like to do shoes
they're like the next book yes I didn't
take up much room so as you know she's
so dirty so I like to just grab a
plastic bag these are kind of like a dog
food bags are used to things so I take
up any room it's just covering their
dirty part I will pop them in my bag
facing that kind of direction so that
they don't take out too much space then
I'm sandals in here as well they're very
new so I won't worry too much by the
plastic bag so as you can see we still
have a lot of stuff to fit in such a
small bag but it will fit I promise so I
like to lay out all my stuff before I
pack it and
when a super super super tight about
liquids and everything so when I get to
the airport I'll pop them in a liquid
bag but before I leave I gather
everything which is a liquid which is
essentially this pile here and I'll see
if that will fit me in a plastic bag
it's so worthwhile to take travel minis
when you go away because I'll save so
much space this is the makeup removal
myself what I'm gonna be using so taking
like a big bulky one so I'll grab my
makeup bag and I will start to place or
make rushes and everything into it and I
like to stuck it by putting all like the
long thin items on the bottom then I'll
grab stuff like my sunscreen and my
skincare and pop them in as well and
with your perfumes as well make sure
they are under 100 mil cuz you do not
want me to be taken away from you at the
airport
this one that I'm taking is Arizona's
it's gonna be like my little holiday
scent and it is fifty milks I know that
I'm all good and then at the end I
actually don't need this whose it's all
fit into this one thing I put in all the
bulkier items like powders and bronzers
and all that kind of stuff as well I'm
just gonna put my makeup bag just in
here it's kind of like a game of Tetris
isn't it like you packing and then
everything else they're like hair
straighteners I was just fine where
there's a little bit of room so I would
say that here then I've got my glasses
my plug and that is literally like
pretty much everything and then this bag
has a really really light front flap but
in this front pocket I'm gonna put like
my sunglasses and my passport as well
and so that's everything that you guys
saw packed into one little case but if
you do have any bulky items like hoodies
or anything like that wear them on the
plane where your bulkier stuff on the
plane every time it's my own wearing
hoodies and stuff um I'll be boiling but
it saves so much space and I have to say
just as a final tip I know it is so so
tempting when you're going on holiday to
pack so many outfit choices and that's
completely fine if you want to pack a
big suitcase but if you do want to have
to carry on you do need to have a little
bit of fashion show in your room
beforehand you do need a tranny outfit
and you need to pick your outfits of
each night and stick to them because you
save so much space we don't take like
ten outfits instead of one not only will
it save you so much time when you're on
holiday you won't be stressing out like
she'll wear this or this or this or this
you know exactly what outfit you've got
planned or what you're going to wear and
it saves you so much space I have a
little fashion show in your room before
and send your photo to your group chat
send your photo team um get people's
opinions even figure out exactly what
you're gonna pack I think guys enjoyed
the style video super chill super fun
let me know if any of the tips helped
you and I'll see you guys in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
