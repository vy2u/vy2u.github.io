hair tutorial to share with you I
absolutely love the ones turned out and
I'm so jealous of all the guys going to
prom because we don't have from this
trailer and I never way so I was
thinking if I was going to go what
makeup what I wear I thought I'd do
something feminine pretty pink bronze
simple girly stick around or to the end
to see the hairstyle as well and I have
a sneaky a little giveaway at the end -
I have done a jewelry collaboration with
still nest and I'm so excited to finally
show you the sneak peek the necklace
that I'm wearing today is actually a
world map it's like a glory we also have
a long chain with a familiar bird that
many of you will recognize it's on my
arm so I actually have this bird tattoo
on my arm and we have brought it to life
in the form of jewelry and I just am so
obsessed it's over funny we also have
the bird style in a velvet choker
couldn't be more meet with her and we
also have this beautiful compass too so
be sure to stick around to the end this
video to find out about a giveaway
involving the story I'm just so excited
I can't even handle it I'm just like ah
so I'll speak to you guys about that at
the end of the video but for now I hope
that you enjoy the tutorial and let's
get into it first thing that you're
going to want to do today is apply a
primer I'm going to Smashbox photo
finish primer today because prom is all
about photos and you want to make sure
that your skin is prepped correctly for
the photos this is a great primer to use
for any days that you are going to be in
front of the camera and throughout
today's tutorial I'll be showing you
products that will work the best for
photos as well because we all know
what's prom without a good prom picture
let's be honest I'm just going to take
a little bit of the primer I'm going to
rub this into my skin and now that we
are freshly primed it is time for
foundation for foundations today I'm
going to use the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation and this one is in the shade
warm beige spray tans are quite a common
thing before a prom so this is quite a
dark foundation but as you can see I
have quite a dark tan on and I did this
on purpose because I know that when it
comes to prom season it's very likely
that you're going to be quite tan but
also this foundation has no SPF in it
and that is super important when it
comes to photos because foundations that
have SPF in them mean that you get that
flashback scary kind of look on your
photos when you are applying a
foundation remember to kind of drag it
down your neck as well because you don't
want to have like you know the seventh
grade makeup line you know what I mean I
we need to start shape tape concealer
and this one is in the shade fair so I
was going to put two little lines
underneath my eyes like that and then
taking my Beauty Blender sponge again
I'm just going to dab these in and
you'll notice that the concealer is like
really light compared my foundation but
believe it or not that's actually a good
thing because means you're going to look
so awake and personally I don't bake my
face I don't know if you guys have heard
of baked in your face but I don't do it
because I don't understand it and this
kind of works medium-high I like to just
use a really light concealer but blend
it in really really well and I find it
kind of has the same effect I'm gonna be
using this benefit cabrillo I'm firstly
just gonna brush my hairs and lace and I
do have like a really in-depth eyebrow
tutorial if you want to see it I'll have
like a card here where you can click on
to see my eyebrow routine because I'm
just gonna fly through this very quickly
for all of you were seeing it
now I'm going to apply these ash box
photo fish eyelid primer in light and
this is just to ensure that our eyes are
totally ready for the Osho that we're
playing today and the cars just really
bright and at the Pops gonna blend this
in with my finger and to start with I'm
using the Too Faced sweet peach palette
and we're starting with this shade
called candied peach and I'm using a
sigma e35 tapered blending brush today
I'm just going to go ahead and use a
very light hand to apply this to my lids
so I'm going to start with these little
motions going all the way up into my
inner corner and then working it all the
way out to my outer corner and then I
like to go and this would like circular
sweeping motion I don't really know why
but for some reason it works I'm going
to add a little bit more to my brush and
then go back in again
and with the same brush I'm going to use
white peach and I'm just going to use
this underneath my brow bone and also
just to diffuse that pink color a little
bit and blend it out now I'm going to
use puree with a sigma
a57 brush and I'm going to put this in
the outer third of my eye and taking the
brush mousse before I'm just gonna blend
this back into my crease
and now with the absolutely guys Inglot
AMC at pure pigment eyeshadow in one to
four I'm actually going to get a bunch
of it on my finger and I'm going to tap
it directly onto my lid
and now I'm taking the shade luscious
from the palette and I'm going to go
ahead and apply this in a corner so at
this point if you want to sharpen up the
line and there's a bit of fallout and
all that kind of stuff
this is when you can go back in with
your concealer and just apply a little
bit and then taking the Beauty Blender
which is going to make sure that our
line is very straight we continue the
direction of our lower lash line so as
if my lower lash line kept going it was
going that way so that's the way that I
am directing my concealer it is now
finally time from the sky to kind of
bring this look all together so I'm
firstly going to go ahead and curl my
eyelashes and then he's gonna benefit
roller lash today for my mascara and I
remember when you put your wand on give
it a little bit of a wiggle like that
it's like you'll be doing later from so
that all your lashes get coated but my
lashes say I'm these the most beautiful
and natural lashes which are the Dani
Beauty ice buy lashes in smitten
so the lashes are now on and you can see
that it just kind of looks like my
natural lashes but just like super long
this is just the best natural lashes I'm
obsessed with them okay now the boring
super concentrating part is now over I
can literally never talk properly what
I'm doing my eye makeup I'm just like
concentrating so hard but it's done now
we can chat let's do it I'm going to
grab my nice pressed powder in Beach and
this is so incredibly perfect for from
looks because this powder works so well
with photography like so good I'm just
going to go and apply the powder plus
the eyes just look great in photos but
it makes your skin makeup last all night
long as well in Australia we have like a
school Deb's get beat on to kind of
thing I didn't worry about it as my
foundation and what do you know it was
like streaky within 30 minutes so if I'm
Leon you back
for my bronzer today I'm going to use
the balm Bahama Mama bronzer I
absolutely love the packaging it's the
star beaut a little bit used as well but
anyway I was going to go ahead and apply
this my cheek and do my little elf thing
so I do the bottom of the L and then I
go up and I do the top of the L as well
and then with that same bronzer I'm
squeezed like a little tiny fluffy brush
any brush is fine and I mean a tiny bit
because the worst thing is messing this
up and it's very common to mess up I'm
going to contour my nose so I'm just
going to follow the natural shape of my
nose and when it's all splotchy and
super-attractive if you want to take
that brush again and make sure it's got
no more product on it but blend it
outwards like this and this will make
such a huge difference for your photos
as well it makes the biggest difference
when you smile if I'm having a contour
nose
having to deal with that handsome
holding brush but I'm going to take this
banana powder by Oprah and I'm going to
apply this under my eye I
for my blush today I'm going to use the
benefit in California blush and so
pretty on the inside oh my god and you
go do your little cheesy smile and
that's for you but it's time for Hilah
I'm gonna bring all look together now
and I'm so excited to see her and I'm
like yes I'm gonna use this Oprah
highlighter which is called blissful I
love it
I do love highlight I'm also gonna do it
my nose and then underneath my eyebrow
so Chloe
naptime's do our lips which means we
have to put on some lip liner this is
the color pop BFF - loner I don't know
why I keep doing that with my hands like
show airs
Brian lipstick I'm going to use the tart
pink lemonade lipstick which is like
this how a bomb is the packaging and it
matches the eyeshadow color like
perfectly good so that is the makeup
portion of this video complete now we
have to do something with this
firstly I'm Sui go ahead and brush all
of the knots out of my hair and I've
held my hair like four days ago so it's
like that really kind of is kind of here
right now but we're going to do a really
nice pretty heatless hairstyles today
because we don't want to damage our here
prom do it okay so all you're gonna need
for this is some bobby pins that's
pretty much it just gonna do a really
pretty girly hair look without damaging
it or anything like that and then I'm
going to part my hair into three
sections
just in like a super simple style I'm
going to start braiding it backwards or
towards the back not braiding it
backwards but toward the back
let me take my above appearance once
that is graded and you guys know that
meth about like it's actually the wavy
side you meant to tell you here at we've
got the straighter then I hope not the
straight side because I never knew that
when I was at school and he's always
he's straight side so who knows if
that's true or not so I'm going to go
and take the braid just make sure my
hair's all straight behind it I'm just
going to wrap it around my head I'm just
going to pin it in place I used to do
this test I like all the time and I was
sixteen I loved it if you do have
shorter hair it's totally fine just to
finish it there anything like that but
with this hair sitting here I like to
cook pull it up a little bit just for a
bit of volume for the other side I
actually like to leave one strand of
hair down I know it might be like super
nineties or whatever but I just think it
looks nice and elegant having like a
piece of hair down on your face so I'm
gonna leave that much down there go
ahead and divide this into three
grabbing pins again this time without
dropping up and pulling up the hair and
then you have this really lovely soft
elegant hairstyle
