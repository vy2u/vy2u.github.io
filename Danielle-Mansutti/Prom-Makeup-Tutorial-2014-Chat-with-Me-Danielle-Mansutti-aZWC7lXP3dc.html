channel today is a prom formal look that
I've made for you guys
nothing too dramatic it's just sort of a
pink girly and right shape I haven't
mentioned the products today I am
leaving them in the downbar I know I
always forget to do it but I am doing it
so if you want to get this a look then
just keep watching okay fresh face I'm
going to set up with my real fixed and
perfect primer buzz could probably need
to make sure that you have long lasting
makeup when I did my school formal or
prom I didn't even know primer existed
and I ended up having a lot of patchy
makeup so let's avoid that today you're
going to be using my Mac Studio Fix
fluid foundation in the shade and w25
this is what I use for my school form
wasn't proms and I know it is a little
bit more high-end and all but I think
that for an important event it's worth
the money because you want something
which looks great off the foundation on
and this is just the one pump and I just
try and get it as much around my face as
possible and then just using my Real
Techniques buffing brush I'm just gonna
buff this into my skin this was like my
golden favorite foundation like Holy
Grail Holy Grail I used to love this
foundation so much that is how the
bottle is looking quite old because it
does give you a really excellent
coverage the only thing is it I fixed my
bankaccount a little bit too much sorry
I had to change to a more affordable
alternative but I do keep this one
around still for important things like
tutorials that maybe on to concealer i
am using the maybelline superstay 24
corrector concealer whatever it's called
in the shade cream so I'm just going to
be applying this in like a triangle sort
of shapes are like this triangle and I'm
grabbing my elf flawless concealer brush
just to blend that in so I don't go too
overboard with my contouring today we'll
make up where we just wanted to keep it
nice and natural and girly and pretty
going to use my chichi bronzer and it
doesn't say the shade but this is the
color of the bronzer and they're going
to using a contouring brush like for
this one and just dip it in the bronzer
to me tiny bit and put that down my
cheekbones my eyebrows I'm going to be
using the chichi high definition eyebrow
pencil in the shade medium brown and
just not go to gym addict with my
eyebrows because I'm doing a shadow as
well I was like counteract each other so
I'm going to just be filling in my brows
with the pencil and I like to start from
the middle of my eyebrow and then work
towards the Hodge I just find that it
looks a bit more natural you want to try
to not get it too much in your actual
beginning of your eyebrow but if it's
called
and focus more on the tail because
otherwise you end up with a very kind of
not a very flattering natural look
next I'm using my Adele brouse sculpting
gel just to make sure that my eyebrows
do not move during day this is a really
good idea for when you have a big event
as well because if you are filling in
your eyebrows you don't wanna get stray
hairs like I've got right now is just
like hanging around being annoying if
you want to spend the night without
having to touch up your makeup too much
or have patchy foundation then get a
translucent powder and they are
absolutely life-changing so and all it
does is it's just gonna set all the face
products as we have on and it will just
ensure that during the day we do not
have any young patchy bits which you
know they're so attractive someone like
me who practices tutorials film
tutorials wears makeup daily of this
face of Australia powder now for like
all months and it's still not even
halfway done who recommended for sure
you can even put it down to your neck if
you are wearing a strapless dress or
whatever you might want to close to your
chest because it helps just to make
other color come together
however the translucent powder is quite
colorless it does have a little bit of a
sort of a brownish gray tinge so you
just want to make sure that your fake
tan if you are fake tanning and your
body at the end your face
sorry yeah Oh master because you don't
want to see your photos and have like an
orange face and a white body of I think
we've all been there girls now we are
all powdered up it is finally time
and my favorite part to do I think it's
so much fun so today we are going to use
both the faces palette from Chi Chi and
the rich gems palette I'm going to be
using a few sort of neutral pink homes
and then I'm going to use this whoa see
it and then I'm going to use this purple
attire as well
yeah just gonna do my eyelashes first
because I hate it sort of like half my
phase of no eyelashes but I've done face
just looks so strange so I'm just
curling my lashes and I'm using my
essence I love extreme crazy volume
mascara I've been using this for so long
now and I still don't run out sorry love
it's that difference though well if you
are genetically picture then you don't
meet with falsies with this look because
we are going to keep it quite natural
peel and I think we will zoom in now to
do the eyes so so you know before I go
into it I'm using my ebay brushes I have
a tutorial on these mama tutorial a
review on these brushes on my channel if
you want to see more about them they're
so cheap and I definitely recommend them
if you're like me and you like to things
both close and personal now I'm going to
just start with a sort of like a
concealer brush going to use this sort
of soft here and just pack that onto my
eyelid for the personal preference if
you would like to use
a primer on your eyelids personally I
don't feel the need I've never done it
before my eyeshadow stays on go for the
inner part of my eyes I'm going to use
this silvery it's actually really dark
on camera but it's still very shade I'm
going to do the same brush because it's
only a black shape and I'm going to pack
this onto my inner corners
they're about three on the bottom of my
eyes
next I'm using this pinky purplish shade
here and I'm just going to pack this
onto a larger brush and put this on the
at-at apart every what's on the outside
of my eyes while I'm working with this I
am blending it into the silver part as
well just to ensure that a bit of
gradient going on so now I'm going to
have a bit of a play around with my
crease and I'm using the rich gems plant
now with this very very deep blue shade
just very lightly start playing it with
my crease
and then with the same but sila brush
I'm just going to apply a line of it
my I'm eating the silk pot that we did
before in the middle next I'm taking a
fluffy brush and I'm just going to blend
at the line into up into my brow area
and I'm not going to go too full on with
the eye shadows because I just want to
keep this natural and pretty and just to
make sure whole we haven't got any
fallout hanging around still I'm quickly
going to be using my face of Australia
pressed powder underneath my eyes this
will just help the fallout stay away I'm
just going to be sweeping this like in a
circle is under time and I'm just so
scared that when stuff this up sorry I'm
going to do very very thin wing
and I'm using the kitchen
black is black black a liquid on a pin
so now the honor is on and the eyes are
done so I'm going to use the chichi
power lashes they look like a DS and now
we wait for this to dry I normally write
about a minute before I put one but time
to reflect online and they are going to
line my lips so I'm going to take my
chichi static liner in the color Fly
Girl I just gave myself it's time for
the lipstick so you can choose whatever
shade you want but for me I was thinking
of doing so the pinky tone too much
everything else obviously so I'm taking
the TT game on matte lipstick and we
have finally done woohoo
so I hope you guys have the best formal
or prom I'm so jealous of you because
I'm so old now it's my god go I hope you
guys took the best time I had this
helped just a few of you I know it was
quite quick to be honest I did talk too
much snakes didn't want to start
rambling I ramble overlooked so I hope
this helps at least one of you and
please let me know your thoughts I would
love to hear your feedback so until next
time guys bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
