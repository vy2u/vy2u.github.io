fuse if you'd like to see how I achieve
this look then please keep watching I'm
going to start off with my brows today
because they kind of just frame your
face and make everything work I'm gonna
rush through this but if you want to see
a more in-depth eyebrow routine I do
have one on my channel so this is a
great tip for beginners as well is to
use tape on either side of your eyes it
will just ensure that you have clean
lines on either side and you don't have
a shadow falling out everywhere so it's
a great little tip I'm using the Urban
Decay Naked 3 palette today for this
entire look and I'm starting off with
strange and I'm just going to pack this
over up my entire eyelids
now with limit I'm going to places as my
transition shade so I'm just going to
pop it above my crease and blend it out
towards my brow bone and this is a
really really really light pink really
pretty color for prom so I thought it
would be nice
now with nuna I love that name I'm just
going to pop this into my crease just
stocking it up but give my eyes a bit
more definition so I'm only placing this
in my crease and not really going down
into the corner of my eye and just
blending it through
I'm going to use factory on the corner
of my eye just to darken it up so just
in the outer corner I'm just going to
pop it in there and just darken up the
look a little bit and give it a little
bit more color and yeah just blending it
through
I'm using trick which is very tricky to
apply because it's not that pigmented I
use this on a wet brush and I apply this
over my entire eyelids but I think that
the bottom layer is better than the top
layer I'm not too sure but I found it
quite hard to get the glittery pigments
out but anyway I decided to put this
over my lids and I chose a more golden
shade instead of a pink shade just for
something a little bit more different
now just take off the tapes and see that
a wonderful crisp line that you have and
all the faked how it's taking off my
face which is really attractive so I'm
just taking this off and as you can see
I've got two very crisp lines now I'm
taking my Too Faced better than sex
mascara and I'm going to put a coat of
this on my top lashes but I'm leaving my
bottom lashes for later on
so I'm going to put this on my other
eyelid and then I'm going to go and pop
on some eyelashes as well this is of
course optional but I find it just makes
it look all come together now applying
my Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation
in the shade 20 and I'm just blending
this through it with a flat foundation
brush and the reason why I'm using a
flat one is because it works better with
the lines around my eyeshadow so it's
not going to mess up the crisp line that
we have already and do not forget to
blend it down into your ears as well
it's super important for something like
prom where you're getting a lot of
photos now I'm using the Urban Decay
Naked skin concealer and I'm just going
to pop this only underneath my eyes and
then blend it out to brighten up my
under-eye
so I always do the bottom of my eye
after concealer so I'm taking factory
once again and just running this with a
pencil brush on my lower lash line and
blending it up to that crisp line that
we've made with tapes just a little bit
more of a sparkle I'm going to put a
light color on my inner eye area and
then add some mascara to my bottom
lashes now with a yellow powder this is
from the AC on tool contour kit I'm just
using this to set my concealer and just
brighten up my eyes even more now with
the Too Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer
I'm going to pop this onto my cheeks my
temples and my forehead so I'm just
applying this quite lightly and building
it up because you don't want to look too
over the topic prom just softer is
better for primaries when I look very
girly and very elegant so just build it
up gradually and as you can see I'm
bringing this up to my temples and my
forehead again to blend it all together
now I'm taking a makeup store blush I'm
going to pop this on the apples of my
cheeks and this is just going to match
our eye color a little bit more add a
bit more color to the face and also it
makes you look like you've been out in
the Sun all day so what's not to love
now use only Rimmel stay matte powder
I'm just going to lightly dust this over
my face makeup yep that's the right word
and I'm just going to yep lightly dust
this over this will just help the makeup
to last longer throughout the day and
just matte your skin so you're not
really oily in photos and stuff like
that
now that my face makeups done I'm using
the Gimme brow by benefit on my brows
this is just going to ensure that they
stay in place all day throughout prom
and also just tense your brows a little
bit so now moving on to Mac's soft and
gentle highlighter I'm just going to pop
this on the top part of my cheekbone
nearly forgot the weapon and this is
going to create a nice and sparkly
effect and it looks so good in photos so
I really recommend looking into getting
a highlighter for your problem now with
the Tootsie stay on liner in center fold
I'm going to line my lips before
applying lipstick I'm using Mac velvet
teddy lipstick I'm just going to pop
this on my lips and we are done I really
hope that you guys enjoyed this tutorial
something really girly and cute please
tag you on instagram if you recreate it
I hope you have the best prom guys bye
