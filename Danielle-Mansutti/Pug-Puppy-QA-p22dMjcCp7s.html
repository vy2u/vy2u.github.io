election today is election day so I'm
watching it I'm freaking out
obviously buzz how this is up we'll know
who's president but I'm watching it like
oh my god but I did ask you guys to ask
you some hug Q&amp;amp;A questions which I'll
answer for you today and let me grab
beanie so we're going to do Q&amp;amp;A your
first Q&amp;amp;A and as you can see she's just
woken up from a nap okay so the first
question is how are you finding being a
puppy mum right now when she's in this
mood it's amazing because she's just so
like cuddly and affectionate and quiet
being a puppy mom I did not expect it to
be as like a full-time as it actually is
it's insane I didn't actually realize
that my entire life my entire week would
be taken up by beans and chasing after
her making sure she's not showing up my
apartment making sure she's not doing
accidents on the carpet or anything like
that which she's been doing many oh I
think it's a lot more than I expected
because I don't have anyone here helping
me out that I'm literally checking if
she's okay all the time then I feel
really guilty if I leave my apartment
leave her in here house having beans
made you happier and what's the biggest
adjustment you've had to make now that
you have beans definitely made me
happier because before she came along I
spent a lot of my time in the middle of
the day just like having naps and stuff
like that because I just felt like
really motivated and didn't really know
what to do with my time and then I get
really sad and I just sleep all day it
was like a weird depression thing that I
had but I haven't been able to no but
all because of her and having the
responsibility of looking after her so
that's a really good thing as well and
the biggest adjustment that I've had to
make
it's definitely only temporary this
because you know she's going to get
older and more Eastern environment but
biggest change for me is that I've
literally been in my apartment for like
five days straight like I'm not
my apartment in five days except to go
out to buy her like a collar which is
like just down the road for me I'm going
crazy in my apartment and it's because
she hasn't had a vaccination yet I have
to wait another 2 or 3 weeks until she's
all fine to go outside be around other
dogs so she doesn't get any nasty
diseases or anything like that can't
wait I can finally walk her because I'm
going crazy sore because I probably get
like a dog sitter or something but
because I'm trying to train her in a
specific way I kind of feel like if
someone comes over and then teaches her
the opposite like it's just gonna we're
gonna go back to square one and she's
awake again how easy is it to train a
puppy and is it hard so far certain
things were easier than I expected and
certain things are harder than I've
expected I taught her to sit on the
first day like she was so fast learning
to sit you know L was the other question
hey what are you bad at toilet training
oh my god I thought she would know puppy
paws and she'd understand like where to
go but she's just taking a loving note
to the carpet and she loves clean carpet
so that has been the biggest challenge
for me training wise in that time which
I feel is gonna take a long time I leave
her like in the laundry on the tiles
when she's sleeping and with puppy pads
and she does go on the pad when she's
sleeping but when she's with me in the
lounge she goes on the carpet even if I
take it to the public baths so thanks
Bea what's the next question why did you
choose to get a pug instead of the
Greyhound that you're talking about in
earlier videos good question simple
answer is that I was like literally
about to go to greyhound landlord said
no large breed dogs in your apartment so
unfortunately I could not have won that
for that reason and I have just respect
their rules though they weren't like
small breeds in the high-rise apartments
which sucks but if I move out into like
house we'll rent a house whatever when
my lease is up then it's definitely
something that I would consider
but unfortunately never was it annoying
at first having things crying what I am
will have you sort of gotten used to it
and has she stopped first
two nights I think it was she cried all
night and I left her in the laundry just
over there which is that room there that
you can see because I want to get her
used to like having her own little room
in her own space I've always like grown
up with our dogs having their own space
I don't want her to be on the couch and
on my bed
definitely not till she's older because
then she'll feel like she owns me and
she called the roofs and everything and
I don't want her to be like weighing on
my bed obviously yeah she cried all
night all night long on the first and
second day because you were missing your
mummy and your brothers and sisters
weren't you meanie yeah um but it
stopped real fast by third night she
doesn't cry much go spend anymore when
she first got here she I'm gonna put it
down I'm just getting all Wiggly yeah
she cried every single hour for about 20
to 30 minutes and like I slept a note
underneath my neighbor's doors cuz I'm
like I'm really sorry but I have a puppy
and it's gonna be really bad for first
few days and I was so happy that she
stopped after like two nights she wakes
up and she cries like 5 6 a.m. I mean my
6 a.m. to 7 a.m. she cries and cries and
cries and cries and I think it's just
cause like she's Restless and she's
hungry and she wants attention but I
don't let her out of the bathroom until
she stops crying like I don't want her
to she keeps eating my hair I don't want
her to adopt the idea that if she cries
she gets what she wants like it's tough
love she only be allowed out when she
stops crying and all that kind of stuff
it really is like having a baby it's
crazy and she's eating my phone right
now I'm probably most asked question
ever is hate the way people were there
so amount of comments and stuff that I
received being like you're replacing
Coco what happened to your other dog you
don't even snapchat your other dog I'm
thinking but do you guys realize that I
haven't lived with her for three months
anyway like I'm just like why people are
only just realizing that Coco's not
being in my snapchat basically I'm
really gonna explain this once because
I've had to like write 5 million
comments - people but
my family's dog so she lives with my
family she doesn't live with me because
this apartment is way too small for her
she is a Labrador Retriever who needs a
lot of exercise and would be severely
depressed living in this tiny apartment
with me and getting no attention and no
exercise because I'd be working whatever
and I know her really well and I know
exactly what she's like and she would
hate living here she is terrible
terrible separation anxiety and it's
just too much like I would have to be
here all the time if she lived here and
she is so much happier with my family
for her sake it's so much better for her
to stay with my family sort of stay with
me but today you're meeting your sister
Coco I need beanie she's she's out okay
yes so thank you for that kiss that was
very very kind beanie so yeah we are off
to meet your sister very soon are you
excited
you got my hairs in your mouth yeah
we're so excited this little one has
literally taken of my life so apologies
to like anyone that's trying to email me
or text me and I've not responded
because I'm literally chasing after a
pug and making sure that she doesn't
pull all over my house I want to ensure
that she's a well-trained dog and a
well-behaved dog because I'm going to be
living with her for the next 15 years
like I'm gonna probably have one I'm 37
and that is so weird I gotta go Chi
absolute step you're at no meanie Mia
I don't discipline her I correct her
like if she is um laying on the floor I
think raps right away and I move her on
the pad I don't like I would never yell
at her because that's you know that
doesn't work I kind of training Judi
funny cuz now I'm getting to know her as
well actually I know
Oh routine like every day she wakes up
she has a crazy mode about three hours
of like constant playtime and constant
we time and after that she has like an
hour nap and I'm like thank the Lord I
can do my emails now I can do some
editing and some work I've taught her
certain things are any like she doesn't
bite me anymore like she bites hair
which is one thing that I need to get
her to stop doing I got oh and then she
stops right away like she does this
little face she's like what what do you
mean what did I do wrong I know I'm not
paying any attention piece like the
first time in your life but I promise I
will in a second okay
I am so naughty you have over 20,000
followers on Instagram a whore of a
little bean
Wow sorry I get very distracted by her
so yeah I'm better off soon but I'm so
excited to meet Coco so excited are you
excited
fanny you excited
we like it outside if you these grass
skills now hey yeah
jumpsuit yeah until it can we be friends
so far cookers very anxious and very
unsure beans wants to be a friend but
Coco is getting a little jealous
so once closet calms down and she stops
being anxious
okay some rats very head back to my out
of like ten p.m. the Albert dogs but
they definitely use spends more time
with each other
I mean things is fine and she wants to
be like best friends with Coco that's
like but Coco is very unsure very
anxious reenter so it'll take time but
at least there's no aggression or
anything like that I hope you enjoyed
the QA and the little clips of the two
dogs are better at home and I will check
