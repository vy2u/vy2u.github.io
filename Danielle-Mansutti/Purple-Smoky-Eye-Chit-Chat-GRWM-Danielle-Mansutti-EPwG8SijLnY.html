I'm in my own setup so it looks really
weird like we've gone back and telling
or something I normally film in another
house but it's really hot in Australia
at the moment or figured it'd be a lot
easier to film in my air-conditioned
comfort in this and exciting side
exciting news I finally got a new camera
video it's just so much easier now
because oh my god it can autofocus yes I
figured today I would film sort of like
a chit chat get ready with me
kind of video because I feel like I
haven't spoken you guys in a long time
I'm aiming for sort of a purple smokey
look so we will see how it goes so
because it's super weird being back in
my old room because it's such a mess
I've obviously been trying to do some
makeup organizing up here so I've been
using this app now for new weights maybe
a few months now it's called snaps or
schnapps and I have three folders on it
it's just like a collection organization
thing and I'm going to list all the
products in there for you guys to see
from my tutorial it's just a lot easier
to help you find where I buy them and
listing them and all the stuff so I'll
just show you as well so you can see I
just have these little shelf thing I
just organize stuff like all my mascaras
but my eyeliners and my lipsticks and
all this kind of stuff it just helps me
remember what I have so I can organize
it very well so I think what I'm going
to do first today is my brows so I am
just going to take a third of it and
list it so as you can see today I'm
using the underbelly hills dipbrow in
the shade dark brown and I'm using a
zoeva 3:22 brow line brush to apply
today I just feel sorry neck hit without
them as you guys know I did just put up
a eyebrows style
Tuesday so you guys can go back and
watch they're gonna see in more detail
so I'm just gonna run through this very
very very quickly and oh my god guys
thank you so much for suggesting putting
the Mack pump on the estee lauder
foundation because it seriously like say
well I so thank you guys so much for
suggesting that it works or one is for
me I have now put on the s-pen water
foundation on that one I noticed apply
this with a chichi sponge
I just thought today's video would be a
great opportunity for us to have a chat
because I haven't actually filmed in
about three weeks I think it's been so
as a lot of you know I if you follow my
Instagram and stuff you would have seen
that I was on holiday so for my birthday
which was in November
my boyfriend Michael organized a trip to
Surfers Paradise which is in Queensland
us to go away to but I do have a vlog up
of our trip and I'll leave a link here
it is just I got on my other channel I'm
not sure if if you're new to my channel
we know this but I don't put any vlogs
up on this channel anymore because
there's only a few people that want to
see what I just sort of kept it to this
being tutorials and stuff like that and
my casual blogs are on the other channel
and I recently purchased from their
website because I couldn't get the
Jacqueline Hill one I don't know if it's
morph or morphe but I bought the warm
neutral palettes which I'm showing you
guys so I'm just going to take this
brand here I'm just going to pop it
above my crease
I'm going to just be learning it through
so I didn't want to get my hands on the
Jaclyn hill palette but oh my god that
sought out so fast so I have not used
this palette yet that's why I have no
idea what I was gonna do it but I'm
pretty sure it's gonna be incredible
because it's already coming off so sort
of so pigmented what would you guys say
that your favorite eye makeup brushes
are because I still find it really hard
with the brushes that I use because they
are only like elf and really cheap
brands so you guys can suggest any great
eye makeup brushes a little bit awesome
help me out a lot now I'm just going to
pack on this light shake yeah
and then I'm taking the lightest color
and I'm just going to blend this through
as well now I'm taking this very doctor
and I'm just going to put this in the
out-of-date of my eye I'm trying my best
to make sure that I don't look like I
just have like a black eye so I was
gonna blend this through so much as I
can now I'm going to use of this very
very very dark purple and I'm going to
places just around this section of my
eye just to darken up a little bit more
and I'm also going to put it underneath
my eye
now taking a soft fluffy brush and I'm
just going to diffuse any harsh lines
and I'm going in with the white shade
again and putting this on the other half
now using the eye Paris liquid eyeliner
I'm just going to do a small wing just
for a little bit more depth and
definition tight lining my eyes as well
now I'm going to put on a little bit of
mascara and I'm using the Rimmel
scandaleyes in the scar which I've now
just put in the Shelf and I'm going to
just put a coat of this on both my top
and bottom lashes
so now I'm looking at the eyes and I'm
thinking that I want to darken it up
just a little bit more so I'm going to
use this darkest shade and I'm just
going to put this on a soft brush very
very very gently around
grace I'm just gonna put on some false
lashes these are the Adele glama
luscious but I threw out the books now
we are moving on to contouring and I'm
using the Australis AC on to contour and
highlighting kit I'm just going to do
two swipes down here with a dark brown
color and then I'm going to highlight
with my banana powder underneath my eyes
I think this look could be easily used
for like a going out clubbing looks so
it's quite dramatic and I'm just going
to contour quite well and this is so
totally off topic but are any of my
Aussie viewers watching I'm a celebrity
get me out here because I'm in love with
it
I love that show so toe touches so much
and if you guys do watch it and leave a
comment and let me know your favorite is
kiss I'm Bob says it's and I'm just
going to pop a little bit of concealer
under my eyes to clean up the fallout
from always pull the weirdest Freese's
when I can see them and I'm using the
same sponge as before to blend this out
so guys let me know what's going on in
your life as well because I know that
I'm rambling a little bit too much so
I'm gonna have to edit a lot of this
stuff yeah let me know in the comments
I'm answering in your life like
something really exciting that's
happened recently or whatever I just so
that we can keep up to date with each
other because I love to hear how you
came as well so now we are nearly there
I'm just going to apply the one thing
we're just going to bring it all
together which is my MAC lipstick in
Siler
I actually revolve this entire look
around this lipstick because I wanted to
see a nice sort of dark smoky more
grungy ish look because as you guys know
right now there's that many valentine's
day tutorials I thought I'd ride the
complete opposite way to do very dark
smoky eye so I'm just like too many
pretty looks out there right now
so this is the finished look guys I
really hope that you enjoyed it it's
super dark and super like not
Valentine's Day I wanted to do something
really different from what I'm seeing in
my subscription box right now so I
really hope that you enjoyed it and
