today I'm here with the mama men routine
I asked you guys on Twitter to send us
some questions to answer today which I'm
so excited about because mum wasn't
really appeared properly in a video with
me before being funny then we're going
to answer a bunch of your questions I
hope you guys enjoy and let's jump into
it this Islam was it weird hearing your
daughter's voice transition into a
la-z-boy oh that's a good question yeah
I think it was a little bit because um I
was just changing so much in so many
ways but I understood why she's doing
Danny was doing it I think it upset my
my mum's done is none in war when she
hurdle yeah like who is this is well she
happen to us it was very quick and I did
understand why it has never say and I've
always thought they had a really good
ear for languages anyway nightmares and
I'm actually I'm an interpreter and IRA
linguist so I think that has a little
bit yeah you pick it up well yeah and
also you know looking in a mirror and
forcing myself to say water instead of
water water because I feel like I don't
know it just would have happened in that
way was this question ever yeah
and Danny's brother who came over so he
was 15 times 12 pieces English as I am
he didn't he ever change his accent in
or the color evenly concealed strain
yeah
if anyway it's gotten stronger because
he wants to colonia next question is
when did you know Danny started YouTube
and were you okay with it
I know well aware of Danny's sort of
tumblr moment and so I knew that was it
was autistic content going on on tumblr
and that was powerful fine because I
know and she's very creative person and
it was something petitioner at work and
then photography and that sort of thing
I think that the Nelson one day we were
like really I remember the first time
that I told you got it because it was I
was filming I always like try to hide
there I was filming in a way like I just
say it was a kind of a home movie or
whatever when I was doing a vlog but I
think it was a video asking about tape
extension and then I kind of told you
about it you're like okay well it first
of course was a bit concerned to hear so
much about the be bad internet yeah yeah
I wasn't nervous about so but we be on
the ala journey with us and it's missing
like what is the funniest and stupidest
thing Danny did child but even stupidest
thing oh my gosh so like being right in
the memory bank right now when you win a
really good girl is nothing really
happening that I can't even think about
I mean because I was I was more of a
quiet but I just randomly come out with
something funny or the funny thing the
moment observer yeah I'd be like wasn't
even is happening it like and what was
Danny like as a child
and what's your relationship like now
compared to when she was little
how long have you go Danny was she was
or she is such a beautiful soul a lovely
little girl very a very good-natured
tomboy playing with her little dollies
and everything like
and I hated pink didn't wear pickup but
she was La Crosse it's camouflage
through and through
had to be yeah and she adored that and
being a tomboy and playing with her
brother and his friends I mean with all
the action and real real action girl
sort of year wicked certissue reason
then chickie laughs but very very shy
outside it's outside the planet research
is questions and question mum to speak
for me in all kinds of situations so if
we never see at a birthday party or
family dinner or something
I would tell mum what I want to say and
then mum would say it for me look at
those two choices at the table yeah I
mean trying what you say it was so
excruciating for you to sort yeah I'll
just jump in and whatever and then try
and try and sort of pull you out gently
and then you do feel confident yeah but
but I guess also I found it easier to
talk alone
and I always have because I'll get our
relationship so in their situations
anyway if I did have to speak one-on-one
with an adult even I was painfully shy I
could do it yeah or like one you know in
farmer school when I was getting bullied
I'd hang out with like the accounting
ladies though adults and I felt like
yeah you know that they kind of got me
and they were like other kids mum yeah
yeah eight with me sometime I don't know
yeah definitely I don't think people
realize like how shy very high to the
foot we go to a parent-teacher evening
and they just say Jane it's a really
good girl it isn't it but we never seen
Europe she never
we don't even know she's that she's like
wide and it sounds way more romantic
risky issues attribution the beautiful
characters always love and humor and
sarcasm that's just in there but people
don't see what you guys know the best
impression is if I quiet reserved young
lady and that people thing a little gay
yeah making always to see that as being
rude I mean they still do I mean I think
that's also hard that my personality
online is is very open and confidence
that when people especially it's in a
group situation I talk to the camera
like that would one-on-one with some
one buddy so in a great situation like
start down completely so I find it easy
to talk to cameras but if anyone is
behind the camera I can't do it because
I could see someone looking at me it's a
really weird thing I think once you're
shy or a sign away it doesn't just go
away
look you learn you learn how to deal
with it it still happens what's your
favorite thing about Danny favorite
thing about her she's a great mom she's
a beautiful soul and I'll just cover so
many more no I just am thoughtful very
loyal and yeah we have added quite
mature head on you so we have um you
know being able to have a veteran or
relations being really good as well
think I mentioned it before but when we
moved to Australia from England because
I like shut down and became like a shell
of who I was it's the only time my life
and mum and I haven't had a relationship
like we were just so distant but in
saying that moving to a foreign country
where you have like no friends at all
and I didn't have like a sister anyone
like my age that's where naturally mom
and I gravitated together and that's why
we became so close it's because we kind
of could rely on each other in that way
and because we're going through the same
thing so I think that's also like if we
stayed in England I don't know if we
would be as qualities we have been in
Australia you know like it was the
situations like that which you think you
know like possibly could be different
but this one is from someone called
Allie Stephen says how do you deal with
the negativity dirty faces online when
you know her so well and that they are
wrong hello Ali thank you so much
question it breaks my heart to be honest
it's very it's very hard to hear or to
reassure so not even here you read some
rubbish and it is rubbish written about
Danny and I do follow everything she
does and how she puts up every all of
the tweets apart from last you go
driving
the collection both rush well I think
part of me wants to just protect her and
say you know just putting RSA in ignore
it and that are wrong with which they
are and but there are times of use will
almost like encounter all of you guys do
that yeah ugly
so we're slightly cheering suddenly my
mom and dad read and look over
everything that I do so every video I
post every tweet and make every
Instagram where they make they look over
it and they always check it in a way and
they check the comments and all that
kind of stuff and because of that if
anyone tries to you know choose to be
offended by something because it's not
meant to be offensive kind of thing I
know in my heart that it's something if
I did for something out there which was
genuinely bad that mom and dad would
pull me up on it and they'd say Danny
you should be doing this or whatever I
don't have to because you know it just
may insert the best thing and I'm on a
platform where I will get critiqued and
stuff versus the way it is but yeah I
know that it's hard for mom and dad's we
can say know about that anyone else that
when they do read some of the the
fabricated nonsense they're just like
yeah I mean he wears a comedy like silly
of you know silly things that are
blatantly ridiculous but is amiss that
was your very hurtful and very very
nasty malicious intent on harming Danny
and her state of mind that's really very
hard and how to deal with it because
it's such an you all for all of a thing
in the professional to such a new area
of social media how do you actually
police it or how do you deal with
certain things and you've got to likely
keep saying and Danny will keep remind
each other the majority of people is
supportive and beautiful and lovely and
well-wishing and you know even to the
fifth Deford and building each other on
15 negative and whatever reason these
these people are doing it which is very
exciting if you're caught with superest
or these people and that they're doing
it they feel they have to do
and we're learning I suppose that good
showing through and people will see
Danny fiduciary and her values and the
harpy per day she has quite the later
part of her sort of teenagers have she's
grown up online and that is very hard
and yeah we always a exactly everyone
makes mistakes going but they're out
there and I don't think more than
anything does nothing I mean there's
nothing to be ashamed that anything that
you've done and and that's something
that it's good for equal you out there
as well remember that it will stay says
I yeah what do you think of Danny's
friend for you
I love their I think it's a safe
environment very nurturing
it's a beautiful positive it is and
that's what we that's what we want
Danny's a lot of negativity and
restricting this is out of my control
and anti-drug control in the big wide
world that she's probably very nurturing
supportive household and and and then
all the sudden it's it's there's been
situation that she's been in or
experiences that it's not what you want
children and you do as much as you can
and still in the values and to get in
through these times
despite that Danny's always been the one
who will go towards that person who
because she seems a little bit lonely or
sit by themselves or needs a bit of a a
perk up or something and you fight her
own shine this could takes a lot more to
do it in with me she do needs trembling
I tell you and I will be survival of
America knows you die and I feel some
like the fan so you just remove it it is
just a beautiful group what do you think
your greatest physical and personality
similarities last and also Halloween
moving to like just like this before
when your hand lighter you know is it
more like me with darkest my partisan we
have the same eyes yeah I think so and
they already blue
sometimes our sense of humor you'll be
more mean groom calm down okay yeah the
fun Brook hey girl she says do you have
a favorite video Jenny and if you have a
favorite child let her have some travel
ones of fantastic other ones I because
they're so Danny can really show her
creativity her and artistic talent learn
which is digital just sitting in front
of the camera with the drone and that's
for the wow factor and then you're
willing New York was pretty good I
really like yeah that's really good and
you like vlogs small I like vlogs yeah
because yeah that's Danny Danny what was
your reaction to Danny doing YouTube as
a full-time job when I quit
Michael yeah you guys do bit convinced
yeah yeah I think so could I just
I mean it's a purse of her you know you
it's a sort of business but you're
showing it's not sort of playing around
with really as you're on your way to a
lot more than what's happening you again
didn't quite understand what what it
entire kind of job it was it was before
to be sitting in a room talking to a
camera now how are you earning a living
you're very convincing and it'll be
brilliant scream and you know very very
very stylish organizers to support suits
me and then the next day Ranger but
anyway she's done it booked it whenever
I'm in Parliament driven you give a lot
of so there's a lot of stories behind it
even the impulsive sometimes you do
actually think about it and then but
yeah we'll get one waitin so yeah I
think it's probably a better best thing
because it was a getting it frustrated
it yeah also I think it was just all so
one different aspects that happening
like I started going to events I know
it's let's firstly reinvent it to be
important so that here saying in and I'm
kind of like it's not really like real
life I suppose engineer sitting in a
camera I think in become really
important to look at that word
supposedly that person because suppose
it's the first time and Danny was a
little bit nervous and she didn't if you
enjoy going to shopping centers any
weddings they kind of
negative effect on her turning that idea
and silhouette and IRA my desire like
I'm just over yes I'll be loitering I
keep walking past the dividers and car
for two years even am I made of it like
the same oh wow yeah as she watches the
monsters in the crowd they were like a
sour face timing ever anything then they
looking I'm Stella Gardena if you want
or expect some other career for your
daughter I thought that there would be
always with arc you could end a little
girl gunning for drawing pictures and
writing stories so one time I should be
stores storyteller or
an author also an illustrator and I'm
pretty happy we get down to the graphic
design roofs that would be really
creative outlet for you you've been in
undoubtedly jobs where she hasn't had
that outlet driven and mad system I
can't be creative ya know at the time
coming of work at call center and I
think it's just very early days and she
was doodling on a piece of paper and
waiting for call to his room and this
guy walked past them the EEO if we
didn't know the time yeah what watching
what you do is I think those pictures
back at school I wouldn't be doing
they're gonna have any wonder that he
really admired it and he actually asked
Danny
he sort of commissioned her to do
fantastic design her own camera
Laurel Muriel we re on the world is
definitely mattifying my head yes I know
