Twitter and actually Instagram Phoenix
good sounds for some questions and fugly
questions about England quitting YouTube
Kings marriage lose all sense of whether
differences what was your parents first
reaction when you said you wanted to go
back to England well they reacted
exactly how you would expect really
prepared to react they quite have
expressed it in a way that they've
always known I was gonna move back
because I've been talking about five
years now but I get into so much terms
of fact that I'm actually doing it was a
bit of a shock to them supposin in
progress they're getting excited now
with me like I'm getting so excited
about the move and because I'm so happy
so excited they're become really happy
and excited so fingers crossed that's my
fingers crossed at some but I'm sure
it'll be fun nuggets the same in England
as they are here that is the one thing
that is quite disappointing because yes
nuggets in Australia are so much better
than that it's in England and I'm going
to miss the Israeli nervous so much
strong obvious to me I love like crisper
Russia nicer the English was very like
soft and gooey but I just soft and we at
least I biggest chocolate synopsize
everybody do you want kids
and if so when do you think you would
want them I do want kids I would love to
have kids later on in life I have two
kids a boy and a girl or two girls
preferably we end up with two boys and
they'll whooshes back and be like free
mom i holding onto the door like I
really want a little girl because I love
the way she doesn't mean my mom has then
I'd left a little girl like have a
relationship with her as well so yes I
definitely love to have kids when I find
our person I settle down I would love to
be married before having kids like I'd
love to be engage with the democracies
and then have kids to late-20s would be
like perfect but you never know anything
once you stop YouTube in the way you
engine please what career path would you
like to go down I
few things I think I like to do we've
always wanted to be behind the camera I
love to do stuff in film TV behind the
camera the camera woman and they love to
do stuff like in advertising marketing
stuff like that I probably have like
quite a normal job because we all know
that when I started YouTube I know ideas
beyond my job I think center of
attention is a bit weird something so I
probably like sink into the background
again and do another job however
throughout my entire life I've always
wanted to be like an author and an
illustrator as well like if I could
write novels I would be so good or write
books in general that would be so much
fun
what are you looking forward to the most
when you move to England
maybe one was enforced the most things
with good friends again like I can't
wait to meet italia a bunch of friends
around London that I have that I can't
see and also I think women will be
forced to the most just like a fresh
start in a fresh new place like it's
going to be so nice to meet new
youtubers and new people and like have a
whole you laugh again because in
Melbourne is not much of a community
here in a competition for anything so
I've always felt a little isolated it'll
be lovely to be in a place where it's
like I don't know like I'm just
surrounded by people on the same
industry with same mindset and yes
hopefully maybe any friends that for I'm
most excited about and getting lots
English chocolate and getting really fat
do you want to do something again like
the meet and greet Mecca had with you
yes I would love that
I would love to do a few meat
ingredients Wiley but the really tricky
thing is that I can't just like forever
and be like meet and greet
it's how because I need to have like the
proper security for you and for me as
well to make sure I know it's going to
come there ruin it anything and to make
sure it will say they are learning to
meet up when they're arranged by company
or in a public space and I can't just do
it
I'm like in like a park somewhere just
in case because this here nicely people
at the Royal
what could happen so if the opportunity
came up to me to a meet-and-greet with
you guys before I leave for England I
would undertake it and want to meet you
because the meta meet-and-greet for me
was like one of the best days of my life
one of the best things I've ever done
and meeting you is the best thing in my
life so i 100% do that again where do
you see yourself in five years time or
phobias I'll be twenty husband I'm so
bad at math oh my god I hope I then I'll
be engaged or married living with a
partner and on that next stage of my
life I'd love to do that by like my late
20s a week right and popping out my
first kid at like 9:30 9:30 pop in the
mouth great way to put it Danny
and finally the big question where in
England I'm moving I would say if you
had to guess where I'm moving you
probably guessed it correctly if you
watch me involves and I will leave a
card up here if you haven't seen them I
think you'll know from there exactly or
I'm moving to but I have since moved to
Brighton which I'm super excited outside
love Brighton it runs don't you I grew
up in South LA in the northwest of
England like seaside town but also
reminds me a lot of London and also
Melbourne because like the alleyways
like Melbourne the beach is like
Southport and then that has an
architecture like London such a perfect
place and obviously full of youtubers
full of other Korean people so I think
this was a really good place to be I
decided not to move up north where I'm
from because I just feel for work
exposed me to be close to London so
really to Brian I'm so excited about it
and I just oh god I can't wait to just
so just get there and start this new
life like I'm just so excited I will be
doing moving vlogs and stuff like that
so I'll do them on this channel but then
for like a week or so and afters are we
doing blogs on my vlogging channel so I
will leave my body channel link below if
you're not subscribe to that I will be
posting what to do
from there as well.those I thank you
guys so much for watching my Q&amp;amp;A today
you get a lovely week and I'll see you
in a few days in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
