year I'm gonna put this beanie on just
cause I can
cuz it's autumn it's full and I'm so
excited about it I had to film this
makeup look please guys today and I've
gone all out with the hair as well just
see it so I really like to create
something matte and dark and autumn
light which is what I come up with today
before we go into it guys if you're not
a subscriber channel I love you to hit
that big red button down below and hit
myself with notifications because
sometimes you should have put my box my
box wow my videos in people's boxes that
sound really weird but anyway I'm
starting with the Smashbox primer Iser
I'm in love with this product just to
make sure that my skin is hydrated
before applying my matte and poreless
foundation to keep the look as much as
we can because Matt really is what
autumn is all about moving on to
concealer I'm using the colour-pop no
filter concealer in 15 I'm obsessed with
concealer and it's so cheaper so I also
get on it guys it's so good though Musa
- Faced Born This Way at powder and I'm
just gonna dip that in the lid and apply
that with my Beauty Blender underneath
my eyes to keep it even more matte as
matte as we possibly can I feel like I'm
gonna say that way do anytime I'm using
the violet lost Nicole concealer palette
today for my eyes and my eye brows just
because I've been loving doing powder on
my eyebrows instead of like pomade at
the moment I don't know I do have an
eyebrow drawer which I will link to you
if you do want to see that and then I'm
gonna set my brows into place before
applying a powder over the top and the
powder that I'm using is the Marc nude
matte pressed powder in nm 201 and then
for my eyes today I wanted to keep it as
simple as possible because the lip is so
dark so with the Nicole concealer about
a boss palette I'm just gonna use three
of the orange shades and super lightly
apply it to my crease because I really
don't want the eyes to be like
overpowering look
honestly guys it's so messy it's so easy
it's like that whatever then I'm gonna
apply it some of the Too Faced chocolate
Soleil at bronzer on my cheekbones this
is a super matte bronzer so it was
perfect for this look as well and then I
realized I forgot to do my eyes half way
here I was like well I haven't applied
mascara I'm using the Kiko extra sculpt
mascara and I was listening to the Mulan
soundtrack right now I'm trying so hard
not to tense so while I'm currently
editing this it definitely seems like I
forgot that I was filming myself thanks
Danny it's oh it's own for eyelashes I'm
using the I spy lashes in flirt from
Danny Beauty I will link them below for
you these are like the perfect perfect
lashes for this look then I'm using the
Abeka
champagne pop as my highlight oh my god
I forgot how good this is seriously you
just check out this genuine reaction in
three two one
and then for my lips I'm using the
TARDIS a lip paint in acid wash I may
have shown the wrong one to the camera I
want to show it's kind of read that in
that but anyway this lip color is
everything and that is my fault awesome
tutorial for this year I really hope
that you guys enjoyed this look I really
love the way it turned out I would love
you to recreate it if you do recreate it
on Instagram please tag me in the photo
so I can see it I would love to see your
recreations and until next time guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
