my oldest video that I have on my
channel which is public look at all

even recognize myself like I feel like I
look so different now oh look at my
teeth as well and oh my god I'm doing
the hand thing still yeah can you see

little bit but I'm like holding it back

self-conscious like now I'm just like a
weird and I'm sarcastic with you and I'm
completing myself I remember when I sat
down time to say I'm like I had to
pretend to kind of be someone else
