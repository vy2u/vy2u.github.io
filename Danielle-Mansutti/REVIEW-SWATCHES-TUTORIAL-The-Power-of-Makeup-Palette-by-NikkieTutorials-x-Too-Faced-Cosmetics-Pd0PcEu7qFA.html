channel today's video is so exciting
because it's just eating dinner it's
currently like 9:00 p.m. my dad came
home and so do you our delivery daddy
and I'm like what that delivery time I
ended up being the best agreeable time
because look what I have my hair side it
is the toothpaste the power of makeup
palette by and nikkietutorials and I
feel like the most proud little sister
of all time or something so immensely
proud of Nikki and Nikki if you are
watching this you should be so proud of
yourself you deserve this so much if
everyone else this is gonna be really
and obvious so you better get hands on
it because it's amazing they made this
eyeshadow look today with it as well I
think it is so important that youtubers
get recognized by how hard they work and
everything and we all know that Nikki
her videos are insane like the
production value and everything every
years are insane and amazing if you
don't watch it you she's definitely
going to watch it because she's
beautiful
so I met Nikki in October we're at a
two-faced event together in LA and I'm
just so happy that they picked her to do
the palette because it just embodies her
so well like the court on the back is
amazing it says when life gives you
lemons punch it in the face and a
squiggle it up like so good this is the
inside of the palette as you can see it
is absolutely beautiful sorry we'll be
using this in a makeup tutorial today if
you do want to seen in makeup tutorial
only please go to this time right here
on the screen however if you are
interested in the swatches and the
review and all that good stuff that then
Anna please keep watching so from the
outside of the palette I think that the
packaging is absolutely gorgeous I love
the print of the palette as well it's
incredibly unique on the inside I love
the names of the shades I love how
personal they asked Nikki as well like
Ivy her dog which is I mean if you have
on snapchat you know what I mean
absolutely love the name
wham-bam as well that is incredible and
I love the color
mystic how how oh my god I mean our
mystic our Dani oh my god what's
happening to you today but there is more
than just the eyeshadow part there's
also a lot of other stuff in the
collection as well we have got a black
eyeliner which is a sketch marker which
is the black you're so two-faced
eyeliner and
have a Too Faced shadow insurance this
is so cute it's a mini Too Faced better
than sex mascara and I believe this is
purple I could be wrong but I'm pretty
sure it's purple which is incredible I
finally we have this little glitter
which is called literally however for
this video I will be focusing on the
part only because I really really really
want to try it the eyeshadows I actually
ended up using a blush isn't eyeshadow
as well but whatever floats your boat so
jumping right ahead
interests watching I'm gonna start in a
really weird order I'm gonna go this way
I'm gonna go sort of darkest to lightest
so for my sauces you can definitely tell
which ones are the most pigmented
I think that all the shimmery shades so
especially these three shades here in
the palate arts so highly pigmented it's
so beautiful
make sure to be using something like a
Mac soft ochre Paint Pot or and I showed
primer sonic that before you use the IV
shape because it didn't come up very
well on my arm however every other shade
in there is so pigmented and so
beautiful but I mean these are the oh
geez right here like chocolates like
bronzer is the og of bronzers and it's
just like it's a golden oldie of to face
bronzers it's so good so I am going to
jump straight into the tutorial now so I
hope you all enjoyed my little review
and swatches of the eyeshadow palette I
would definitely recommend you guys go
and get this you can correct some
beautiful colorful looks and also smokey
eyes definitely would like frosted young
makeup and chilled and wanted you could
get really beautiful smokey eye with
those so let's go into in the tutorial
and I hope that you enjoy what am i
doing
I don't know so having a first glance of
the palette there are so many beautiful
colors in here that I sort of stuck the
choice about what to make I feel like I
really really really want to use mystic
hour and when them but I did recently do
a blue eyeshadow tutorial so like so
firstly I'm actually going to use the
Abhilash which is called justify my love
I'm going to use this in my crease as a
transition shade and then I think I'm
going to go into with wham-bam and sort
of put those two together it's why
because I just feel that festival makeup
to throw other one with the bluey green
eyes so I have sparkles like all over my
face still it's gonna keep the lending
that out and now you can see the pimple
up close damn and I'm just going to take
the plunge and go straight in with
wham-bam I think I'm going to put this
on my lid and then we'll just decide
where to go from there
and I'm going back in with the pink
shade and the crease
I'm going to focus a sugar-coated sort
of on the middle of my eye and then
frosted YUM on the inner corner as well
and now picking up web and once again
and I'm going to focus this mostly on
the outer parts of my eye so that we can
get a little bit of a halo effect
and now for a bit of fun to make this
super colorful I'm going to use this
joke here called mystic hour and I'm
going to put this on my lower lashline I
have absolutely no idea if I'm gonna
ruin it by doing this but I'm thinking I
might as well play with the colors
because the colors in this palette are
just like to die for
I'm just pick up a bit of mystic hour
and I'm going to run it along my lower
lash line I'm not going to go ahead and
clean up the line that we have yeah
nobody is the Too Faced better than sex
mascara to add some length to these
lashes for my lashes today I'm going to
use the new I spy style in wild this
will be live in super moms so excited
and to everyone who has watched all the
way up to this point let me just say I
love you and thank you so much it means
