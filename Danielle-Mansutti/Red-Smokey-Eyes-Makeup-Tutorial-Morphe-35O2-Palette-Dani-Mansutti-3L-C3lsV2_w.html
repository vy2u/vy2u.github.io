today's video we are playing with the
morphe 35o 2 palette which I am in love
with it is so pigmented it's insane and
as soon as I saw this I was like this is
my kind of palette you guys know how I
feel about my warm so I was like hell
yeah
this is a totally unbiased review I'm
not an affiliate of morphe in any way
and very surprised and so grateful that
I have my hands on this or my honest
thoughts and opinions and my honest
thoughts and opinions are that I love
this palette this is gonna be one of my
favorite palettes from now on I can't
really fault it besides the fact it has
no white shade that was slightly
annoying for my lid and my eyebrow
highlight the Sun is following me I came
over to change my camera but it is
beautiful and I call like you guys to
see this tutorial so if you aren't
really subscribed to my channel I would
love you to that big red button down
below I put up two new videos every
single week I would love to have you on
board and without further ado let's jump
into it I'd firstly love to give a shout
out to Sophie Bella for inspiring me
with this look today because I started
on a channel I was like oh my god that
is so beautiful I didn't know exactly
what to film with a palette but she
inspired me a lot too don't forget to
check her out
I'm using a multi 43 brush with the
ablaze and I'm just mapping this out on
my crease we're gonna be cuttin a crease
there I'm so excited
next I'm taking an M 507 brush with hate
and I'm going to use over the top to
help blend it out and also deepen
everything up then I'm taking a clean
blending brush to make sure that that is
all nice and blended there is so much
blending in this look by the way be
warned it looks so good at the end it is
worth it then within morphe m 511 and
all I'm going to use this underneath my
brow bone to make sure that everything's
blended and then I will actually go in
over the top with an eyebrow highlight
which is pure now this is the most like
highlight show that you're gonna get out
of the palette but I did still think
it'd look pretty nice so I wasn't
disappointed
the best cheat in the world when it
comes to cut creases is using concealer
to make everything actually really sharp
again so I'm using my Tarte shape tape
in fair and I'm gonna map out my crease
then I'll add this gorgeous shade called
zodiac with a wet color pop brush and
I'm gonna pack this all over my lid and
I'm also gonna use it as a gradient with
another orange shade and with a
highlight shade that we use before as
well
and I could have stopped here but I felt
like that wasn't enough depth in the
eyes that I used rich I'm just using
this in my crease and also on the outer
part of my eye just to darken everything
up and give a little bit more dimension
using the Tarte many dot eyeliner I'm
just going to draw it on my water lines
as well just to deepen it up and then
we're gonna start working on the lower
lash line so I'm gonna use a blaze again
and I'm gonna use this to blend
everything out and kind of be a bit
messy with it and I'll also be using
heat in this as well with a smaller
brush so that we kind of replicate the
top of the eye onto the bottom as well
it's lashes time and I'm using the ice
by admire lashes honestly the best when
it comes to just enhancing your lashes
you can see in that before-and-after
it's just so pretty and so natural then
for lining my lips I'm just going to use
a NYX liner and then I'm using this over
a lipstick over the top and all my
products will be listed below in case
you know what anything is but you could
have gotten with a nude for this but I
went with a red because I was like no
why not and this is the finished look
and I really hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial today I had so much fun filming
this I really really really loved the
way it turned out and I can't lie see
you in my next video so until then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
