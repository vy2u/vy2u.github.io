be quite a long one because I have a lot
to talk about and I want to start off
firstly by saying they'd never wanted to
make this video I never wanted to talk
about this and that's why I avoid
talking about drama so much now I know
that a lot of my following we have no
idea what I'm talking about I will
explain everything to you I know there's
only a few of you that know what's going
on it's getting to the point now where
it's really affecting me because people
are hearing one side of the story
and you know unfortunately it's making
them really dislike me and I completely
understand if you hear one side of a
story especially in this kind of
situation you're like that girl's a
horrible girl she's a manipulative
victim card did it I did it her I want
to dress all that today like I want to
just be completely honest and open about
everything so without rambling too much
I want to get straight into it I've had
quite a few gossip channels where Skylar
youtubers that will sit down and gossip
about youtubers and stuff that they're
doing there's like lots of comments
about youtubers and everything and
that's that's the content that I choose
to upload even though that's not the
kind of content I agree with because I
don't feel like bringing anyone down
just to get views on a video is a very
nice thing and I definitely don't agree
with that I can totally understand how
it's like entertainment for some people
because you know it's just like the
magazines that you see on all the
newsstands everywhere you know gossip
about celebrities and stuff like I
totally get it I totally get why it's
entertaining I totally get why it's
juicy and everyone was to watch it all
that kind of stuff so yeah I understand
but when you are the subject of it um
it's a little bit hard and I don't know
how to react when these things happen
because if I talk about it it can feel
the fire and it can create more of an
argument and everything that I say can
get scrutinized and if I ignore it it
might look like I'm in the wrong and I'm
just like trying to pretend like I've
done nothing wrong whereas I'm just like
I don't know what to do like I know how
to react essentially the first sort of
big thing that was happening was from my
daily life video which I put on private
today because it was just causing too
many issues and it was not worth having
up at all and completely my lesson about
that thing is that I want to stress
about my videos
when you watch a video or vlog or
something that I upload it isn't an
actual live representation of my life
it's all edited you don't see what goes
on like in different moments and what I
choose to show is what I choose to put
out there so there's lots of things that
happened that morning like what was that
thing I was like 3:00 a.m. or something
I went to let the dog out you know I've
taken beans to puppy training I was
talking to many dog obedience people
I've spoken to a trainer in person
everything about her when I got her and
I have wanted beans for so long as you
guys know like so long I wanted beans
and I could never figure out the right
time to get her because my job involved
so much traveling and my job involved so
much like being all over the place but
for the most part every single month I'm
home you know three out of the four
weeks I'm normally at home and I'm at
home all day like I don't leave the
house so from the moment that she gets
up to the motor she goes to bed 3 out of
4 weeks of the month I'm with her 24/7
to the fact we're dog trainers actually
telling me I need to stop doing that
because it's too much time with me on
that week that I'm not here she lives
with my parents and my parents adore her
they absolutely love her and we have a
Labrador called Coco which is my family
dog who that's my parents and they got
on so well and I'm so happy that they're
getting really well they have a really
really lovely time at my parents house
so it's really good that she sort of
lives with us both and she goes back and
forth
once she gets used to different people
and what's kind of stuff in the day of
my life video being YouTube make it look
all pretty and all that I you know try
to do like a shameless self-promotion by
putting in my Twitter feed and stuff
first so people go and follow my Twitter
you know me sitting on laptop on social
media stuff like that
where's like I don't do that I don't
throw it on Twitter in the morning I get
up I let her out I have my breakfast but
I didn't show that because it's a
YouTube video and it wasn't like an
actual representation of a live feed of
my day that makes any sense I would
never leave her locked up in a dark was
it dark non-ventilated room for 15 hours
which is what I'm reading a lot I don't
understand whether 15 hours thing has
come from because I would never leave
her in there for 15 hours on that
specific day she went to bed maybe like
11 or 12
finally cuddle her until she falls
asleep on this couch and then when I put
her down she wanders
into her remember there which used to be
a spare bathroom and now I've like got
like beds and toys and water and food
everything in there it is ventilated it
does have a vent there is air going
through it there is a nightlight in
there as well so she's never in a
pitch-black room and she's got
everything that she needs and when she
walks in there she's asleep and when she
walks out of those she's just woken up
there is an every time when she's in
there crying or restless or anything
like that because if she was I would
literally be up like a shot in there to
see if she's okay because I'm such like
a dog mom and I like want to make sure
that she's okay all the time and
everything like that it's getting really
hot I feel my hair conditioning one
thing okay come come down okay so that's
that and then when I put up the video no
one commented on it at all I think I got
her from my parents house day before or
something I don't know what she she ate
but she had like a poo explosion all
over before and I was thinking in myself
well you know I'm having a day in life
video I'm gonna include it because I
always want to be a bit like oh look at
my daily life of the ever you to look at
me cleaning up who her life isn't
perfect and all that kind of stuff like
it was just I don't know I just was like
oh this is my life kind of thing and I
didn't get received in that way it was
received that I deliberately lock her in
a room for 15 hours in darkness like a
torture chamber essentially and leave
her to sit with her faeces and as you
can imagine to read hundreds hundreds
and hundreds and hundreds of comments
saying that and accusing me of that it
is so hard not to tell people that
wasn't what happened that's not the full
story it's just so hard I'm like your
tongues I'm like it's so I don't know
it's so difficult my job I don't know am
I supposed to react or am I supposed to
not react like I don't get it I feel
like if I react it's just gonna make
things worse if I don't react it makes
things worse so I'm just like I don't
know what to do and so I just have my
friend text me saying I'm you mean
reading this crap about you on Twitter
so everyone that knows new person is
like what the hell is going on
now literally as I'm saying that that's
coming through that's someone that knows
me person so anyway yes I learned my
lesson completely even though every
single job that I've ever had my family
and family friends and everything we've
always given a dog with our own room
with their own Bednar and toys and their
own food and water where they sleep at
night because I was always taught
growing up it's not okay to have your
dog on the bed because it's unhygenic
and you know it's it's bad it makes dog
things that dominating you and all its
kind of stuff which I don't know is true
or not I don't want to speculate I think
that's right or not that is what I was
taught growing up I could never have my
dog on my bed it was not allowed in
house a dog had to sleep in his own bed
in its room and that's what I was taught
growing up and then before I got beans I
like I said before I asked so many
trainers so many of them what I should
do with her because I live in an
apartment I live so high up like if you
guys knew how many Falls up I'd be you
wouldn't be like you have to take her
outside takes me about 15 minutes to get
from here outside so it takes a long
time I have like a grass patch on my
balcony which is where beans goes to the
toilet now and she's like completely
tulips right now which is amazing she's
currently yeah having fun in her bed
just Charlie fine we live in I live in a
very small apartment I make sure before
I got her with the breeder with everyone
that it's okay for her to be in this
environment everyone was like pugs are
the perfect dog for your space and
everything like that so I did so much
research in fact I do research for 60
years before I got hurt to make sure all
you know I was doing everything I could
to make sure she was most comfortable
life and I noticed there's quite a few
people that have reported me to animal
authorities because being sleeps in her
own room so people have reported me to
stop at the RSPCA I know if it's
pronounced Peter or Petter various
animal authorities and quite a few have
got in touch with me and I have
essentially said in their emails they're
like we can see you're being bombarded
with hate and we don't agree with a lot
that we're being sent or we're reading
about you and looking into the content
that you produce we can't see any abuse
being you know being inflicted on your
dog have a better did tell me that I
should
change having her in that room to
putting her in her bed in my room so I
completely took that on board and since
that video went up she has not slept in
that room she that she goes in there to
eat her food drink her water and now she
sleeps in my bedroom on her bed on the
floor so I learnt my lesson on that
completely I didn't realize that dogs
had to sleep in the owners room I
thought you know my whole life it was
okay for him to sleep in the rest ways I
guess I just didn't know that it was
such a bad thing and I'm really sorry if
I've offended anyone by putting beans in
our own room because that was not my
intention whatsoever I love that dog
with all my heart like I love her so
dearly and she's changed my life so much
as I got her she is not a fashion
accessory in any way shape or form she
is like my best friend she's always like
my daughter like I love that dog and
anyone that has me on snapchat or
anything can see just how much I love
her and I would never do anything to
make her feel uncomfortable or make her
unhappy hello anyone see it trust me on
that I've taken all your advice on board
and I've totally changed where she
sleeps and I do appreciate those that
spoke to me in a approachable polite way
to explain she shouldn't be in her own
room I really respect you for talking to
be in such a nice way because I had to
read so much abuse and I also want to
tell you that I do block everything that
I don't agree with because I am someone
that likes to be positive I don't like
having negativity on my page because I
just don't like I don't understand why I
wouldn't block them even if they're just
comments like I bet this comment is
going to get me blocked I will block
that because I just can't be bothered
with spending my energy on I don't know
just having people following me that
aren't very nice and I would rather have
very subscribers that are really lovely
then 1.3 million and half of them are
nasty like I would honestly want them to
unsubscribe me and unfollow me because
you know I just I don't need that kind
of stuff in my life and I don't care
about numbers I don't care about
followers I don't care about views and
stuff anymore I literally don't care I
just want to create content which I love
and put it on a platter
and people to enjoy it and it really
sucks how my personal life is dragged
into me we didn't drive into everything
now you know I think I used to make
Beauty videos and here we are like my
personal life is dragged in to get you
so this is another topic this is already
a long video but here's another topic
there's lots of things that have
happened this year which have made me
look like a really horrible person
because they're taught from one side and
I've never made a video knowing it'll
get a lot of views being like my fake
friend story or my stalker story or
anything like that like I'm not that
kind of person you guys know I'm not
that kind of person and whenever I get
hate for it at me I don't just be like
one or do it trying to avoid it but now
I'm going to address all of it the
madding situation let's just go that
there I have never spoken about it
publicly essentially she doesn't want to
be involved in any of us online drought
trap drama crap I don't want to be
involved in it either neither of us want
anyone to pick apart our old friendship
and it sucks that people are doing it
wouldn't neither of us want people to do
it it was almost a year ago and now it's
being surfaced and it's so unfortunate
because we don't want this to be on
there and what happened basically is
that Matt and I were friends for a long
time I approached like the first day of
school and I went right up to her and I
said you're the prettiest girl I've ever
seen in my life like I just want to be
your friend I don't know why I said that
I just did and then we were friends and
you know we were like best friends for a
long long long time I always saw Maddie
is someone who I wanted to be my best
friend like I never clicked anyone as
much as I click with her and I loved her
so much
but for various reasons after school
like we just naturally drifted apart a
little bit because we didn't see each
other everyday at school anymore or when
we would go to catch up something might
come up or whatever and but we always
manage to be good friends and then you
know as time went on I saw the YouTube
with all my friendship they started to
change a little bit because people do
they understand what I was do
kind of a bit freaked out but I'd sit
talk to a camera in my room you know
which is fine because I kind of filtered
out people that didn't want to support
what I did anyway and bring new people
that do support me which is great
essentially you know I was with my ex
for four years I think oh no we broke up
in December or January like a year ago
and I had no friends like I had zero
friends because I just like relied on
him for everything which is bad I learnt
my lesson from that and Maddie was like
my only friend and then Michael my broke
up I moved just beforehand I was like
away with Michael overseas and I was
texting manage to explain the situation
like what should i do what should I do
when at this point Maddie was living
with me just having our own issues she
needed someone to stay and I'm like
Maddie you were more than more complete
with me like I have spare room for you
come and live with me and so she can
live with me throughout a month I was so
happy when she came and moved in with me
because I just loved having a friend
there and I loved being with her every
day again like we were at school like I
loved it I don't want to give too much
detail about things like even though I
could sit here and tell the whole detail
but me and Maddie story out of respect
for her even though we're not friends
anymore like I don't I don't want this
to be sort of you know speculate or
anything like that I'm just totally
saying my side of the story you know we
we talked about a lot about YouTube
she'd ask me about equipment and all
this kind of stuff and she casually
mentioned one time that she wanted to
start a YouTube channel and we did a few
videos together on my channel and when
she said that I was like oh my god you
understood each other I was amazing
what you want to do - did I forget she
said what I want to do personal training
stuff fitness stuff and beauty stuff and
then she said but I want to do it on my
own like I don't want your followers to
follow me like I want to create my own
following and everything like that which
I was like you know amazing that's great
you would ask me about the equipment and
also kind of stuff and I tell her you
know where I got my lights from where I
got my camera from and then she
obviously set up her own equipment
through that me and Michael went on
holiday this is just before we broke up
as I was leaving Maddie texts me
basically was like I ought to tell you
you better deter and I was like are you
moving out like I just don't know why I
knew I just knew she was moving out
because she slept at her boyfriend's
house only everything
that she was there and she said yet that
she was gonna move him with her
boyfriend and I was obviously like
really upset like no I'm losing you
it's really didn't want her to move acts
I loved living her so much but she moved
out of my house and then I went away
also because I was going away she'd want
to be in the house for to expire self so
she moved out as I went on holiday and
when I came back from holiday my ex and
I broke up at the airport we call things
up after the holiday and around that
time I obviously texted buddy just
basically saying you know I really
really really need you right now like I
had no one and as you can imagine like
after four years of being with someone
and literally isolating yourself and
having my friends like accept Maddie of
course and my mum I was like whoa like
Who am I meant for time with and January
very much for me were like the weirdest
months of my life at the lowest lows of
my life like you guys already know I
have struggles and breaking up a
relationship like that was so hard like
it was so hard and being completely on
my own so hard and the hardest thing was
was to be silent about it online I
casually mentioned it in like a
Valentine's figure or something i think
but i never made like an exposing video
or my breakup story or anything like
that per views like i didn't talk about
it out of respect Michael I privatized
all of our boyfriend/girlfriend tags are
privatized all our blogs and everything
I was like we obviously want to move on
from each other and if we have new
partners as if they want to go on his
ex-girlfriend's YouTube and see all this
content that they've produced together
so I was like you know what I'm just
going to remove all that Michael and I
saw each other like in the February at a
party and we met we're talking about
that and I told him about you know put
everything private and he's really
appreciative of it all and we were
obviously talking every now and then
about it the friendship went a bit sour
between Maddie and I around that time I
was really really just needed her
because she was my best friend and I
just wanted to come over and like you
know hang out with me but every time
that I would ask she'd say she'd be busy
with her boyfriend or whatever like she
never could come over and I was
obviously quite upset because I was
so loan and so down and I wasn't
thinking straight because I was just sad
and then I talked Maddie that I wanted
to organize a holiday for us to go to
Bali so I organized an entire holiday
for us and then about a week before she
told me she couldn't go for like for
family issues which he knows completely
fine so at that time I just felt like I
was losing her and I don't know it was
all a bit weird and it was a really
weird time in our friendship because I
just I don't know like I just felt like
she wasn't there for me and then I
wasn't really looking at my phone at
that time because I don't really want to
be on social media when I was like so
miserable and I'm still posting videos
even though I was so miserable from this
breakup you guys know how hard that was
to get like to do two videos every
single week and bite my tongue about how
miserable I was it was just the worst no
like in such a weird place I didn't
really guys wash meet about a week and
like Maddie and I weren't texting
anything because we just seemed to drift
a little bit yeah I wasn't look at my
phone and then I went on like YouTube or
something and I saw like three days
earlier Maddie had posted her first
video on YouTube and I was a little bit
like oh wow like I didn't know she's
going to post already that I didn't know
that she was posting it or was going to
go up like I thought she texts me be
like hey babe I'm going to upload a
video like just at her and I wouldn't
obviously be like awesome I'm gonna
watch it but for some reason we were
just a bit like distant at that point
anyway and I think also because she
wanted to sort of branch away from me
and create her own thing I can totally
understand why she would want to be
separate from me in that sense I wasn't
thinking straight at that time we had
like a chat a text chat which is a
private text message which I do not
understand why is on the internet it
blows my mind so in my mind you know I
wasn't thinking straight I was thinking
you know I'm so alone pour me another
large just for the break-up I'm really
sad gonna do my best friend
doesn't want to see me and then my best
friend has uploaded a video and I had no
idea about it and I just wanted to be a
part of it and all this kind of stuff
and it was a little bit like so we had
this like disagreement no she was really
upset with mixer didn't support the
video share or promote it whatever and I
was like what I thought you want to do
it on your own and do like I'm sure you
guys have seen the messages but please
realize at that point in time
I was a bit like upset because I really
needed her and she was my best friend
she was really there for me and we've
spoken about so many times so I know a
lot of sounds probably now she knows
that this is the reason why
since then Maddy has sent me a really
long apology text about a month ago
that's so like with my dad it's cleared
it's you know it's annoying that it's
coming up now because we are done with
it and she apologized for not being
there for me and everything so it's not
like she you know she thinks that was
the right thing to do anything like that
like she totally gets why we were that
way that certain time things were just a
bit sow the whole year and a bit awkward
and every time that I'd see her at an
event or something or like a friend's
birthday I would go up and always so how
to always got to always give her a kiss
on the cheek always say hello always put
the effort in to just look at her and
smile and everything because I don't I
don't like confrontation like I like to
be civil and mature and that's just the
way I am and then it really upset me
recently when I found out we had like a
girls day somewhere and I was talking
about a while and basically about this
kind of stuff and she just like turned
around and rolled her eyes or my friends
and said some comment which was really
rude about me about behind my back and
it's all just like girly stuff and it
really upset me because I was just like
all my friends would tell me the things
that she was saying behind my back in
person as well and that's like you know
I'm not going to go into detail about
that because it's irrelevant but that's
basically where my head was at and then
I came across like my exes Instagram one
time because I was on my explore page
and I saw a photo of his pop up and I
was like oh my god was he up to
well in his photo and then being a girl
I was like what else is he up to and I
was like look through his Instagram and
then I saw that Maddie was writing
comments to him saying that her and her
boyfriend Miss Michael and stuff which I
didn't understand because Maddie never
liked very much sorry I just sent her
message and I was just like hey I'm just
wondering you know you guys friends now
and you got to understand from my point
of view like there's always other stuff
like you know Maddie's sister write all
this really nasty stuff about me online
and
for some reason all of our messages like
that I've had with Maddie she's that
screenshot it from her side and it's
been uploaded onto the Internet and I
don't know if she uploaded our friend's
uploaded it but I never happen vocal
about any of the situation I never
uploaded any text I never spoke about it
I never made a video about it because I
didn't want it to be an issue and I hate
that I have to sit here and talk about
it cuz it's essentially we have spoken
about it we've moved on we don't want
anyone else to talk about it
I don't Matt he doesn't you know that's
the end of the story basically there's
other little things you know about her
responding positively to people that
were putting me down and stuff and she
has apologized for that she said I look
back on it and I realized it's really
wrong I don't get why it's being brought
up again because it's old news we need
to move on that's the basic story of it
it's just a friendship where neither of
us are in the wrong and neither of us
are in the right either you know we both
did bad things it's not like I'm a saint
here and she's a saint here she did some
bad things I did some bad things I
regret a lot of things that I said
because I wasn't thinking straight and I
was just being like a big bitch and I
was a bit like why are you being my
friend right now hell I was using that's
the way we are were girls and I was just
really sad at that time and you know I'm
not saying that I'm in the right at all
I'm just saying my point of view like to
understand my train of thought at that
time yeah lots of random stuff but I
just felt quite hurt when I constantly
tried to hide anything online bad about
her I never encouraged my subscribers
ever to attack someone and in a recent
gossip video I watched someone said that
I used my followers to attack her I
would never do that I never asked anyone
to attack anyone I am so against her in
every single way shape and form I do not
believe in bullying I do not believe in
harassing someone it is so wrong and I
would never do that please realize that
I've also heard that there's a Facebook
page I have called Pham studies which is
apparently a page used to like bitch
about people which couldn't be further
from the truth
we literally talk about like our dogs
our relationships makeup and it's not
really an active group anymore it sort
of like appeared in January when I was
really lonely and then now hardly anyone
posts in it anymore
like I can't believe how like screwed up
this is all getting and anyone in the
family this group will realize it is the
most drum free innocent group I've ever
seen on Facebook trust me there is
nothing bad in there at all I could make
it an open an open group and you will
all see there's never been any hate on
there anything like that also so about I
have a private Twitter chat I literally
don't know what they're talking about I
don't have a private Twitter chat what
else oh yeah either one
so much going on it was like oh my god
especially I don't want you guys to
follow Maddie and comment on our stuff
and make your assumptions if I'm in the
right she's in the right we're in the
wrong whatever it's literally nons
business with minor Maddie's I hate I
absolutely despise the fact that I'm
sitting here talking about it to YouTube
I hate it because I do not like talking
about this stuff on you do with like oh
like private life business it's no one's
business and so annoying because I don't
like telling these kind of stories but
anyway you're happy she's like how you
just play with me and shut up other one
is that time that I was just in shopping
center I was walking around and there
were two girls that were following me
around I turn around three times smiled
at them as if to say like hey do you
want a photo and they just kind of like
would stop and cut I keep following me
and following me follow me falling which
is fine like I'm totally so that I have
one point 35 million subscribers I get
that it happens you know but I love I
love what meeting you guys I love it
when you come up to me and you go like
hi dad each other and you'll notice
every single time that you do I'm so
nervous
so if you think you are nervous to
approach me I'm that you're saying that
being like I don't want to say you're so
pretty you're so beautiful like I don't
know what to say so yeah but I do love
meeting you because it makes me feel
like oh my god I have so many of these
like on my friends and so when people
follow me around or my personal biggest
dislike is people taking photos of me
from afar of me eating and we standing
whatever and it looked to me and I was
with my mom and she said to me it looks
like they're trying to take photos of
you I turn around in the kind of has
their phones up like that look at me and
it's time to make me feel a bit
uncomfortable and then I went into came
up with mumps look at some stuff and the
girls were still following me around and
I don't know why whatever reason it
really brought on my anxiety because I
just felt like I was being followed
because I
and every single invitation I gave this
girl's to come over it just felt like
they they would like run away and then
come back and follow me again and it
stuck because I felt like am I being
really intimidating like I just don't
know why they won't come up to me and
say hi I couldn't concentrate like when
you start to feel anxiety that I like
she could not focus on anything I was
just being in super paranoid mode and I
was like oh well this guy's falling me
super super super in-depth information
about me right now which I need to put
out there which is so private when I was
having quite deep therapy about my
anxiety my therapist told me because I
was bullied at 14 15 16 when I see 14 15
16 young girls in a group or following
me it automatically triggers my anxiety
it brings back the memories and the
thoughts and the really dark times that
I had at school and I know I don't know
why but I naturally get anxiety around
girls of that age it's something it's a
subconscious thing on my head that's why
it affects me more than a normal person
and I need to just put that out there so
yeah I really don't want to do all this
stuff it's so annoying that I have to do
this but yeah they were follow me around
I so feel bit uncomfortable and I kept
turning around being like hey hey but
not they didn't want to come up to being
approached me so I said to mom like I'm
starting to feel a bit of panic coming
on I need to get out of here we had so
much to do still mums like alright I'm
gonna walk you straight to a car right
now because you were getting so checking
and we walk into the carpark I turn
around me and every time I turn around
the girls were still following me to my
car I can't apologize for how I felt at
that time I mean like I felt
uncomfortable I felt a lot of anxiety I
don't like being followed it makes me
paranoid I can't apologize for how I
felt at that moment and then I tried to
drive and if you guys know Chaston like
you drive out to wobble road and there's
a petrol station like right there and I
pull straight to the petrol station
because I couldn't drive because I was
shaking and yes so many of you it may
sound stupid that I was shaking
okay that's fine whatever but I was and
I can't you know I can't apologize and
it was like it was shaking I felt like
crap and I went on snapchat and I just
made a snap and I said would have loved
it kick out to me and said hi like I
love meeting you guys and you
so I tried to invite them to come over
to say hello but they didn't they didn't
come over and I said it made me feel
very uncomfortable when they followed me
all the way to my car that was what she
called snapchat and then you know once
that was out there the amount that that
blew up was insane people were going
around being like Danny tony claims that
she's being stalked and harassed by 13
14 year-olds never ever ever did I ever
say stalked or harassed I said I was
followed because I was I would never
make a stupid allegation like that like
13 14 you girls stalking me why would I
say that that is so stupid they were
just following me cuz if I wanted a
photo no too shy but when I did invite
them to get a photo they kind of run
away so I don't know what to do I don't
want to chase it up and be like do you
want to vote it with the thing you know
I'm not to do it always videos coming
out of you know I'm a horrible person
and I got my followers to abuse nice
girls apparently which couldn't be
further from the truth because what
happened was that about when I an hour
ago when I got to my apartment I went on
Instagram and I saw a very long comment
from one of the girls and she reticles
like I'm so sorry like we just wanted a
photo with you I'm crying right now in
Chadstone you know below were like we do
not do and all this stuff and I thought
oh god like I wish we could have just
spoken face-to-face and being like let's
get a photo and it would have all been
like so because they were being shy I
was being shy we're both being anxious
and we're both it's not like I don't
know what to do um - wish I saw that and
I thought oh my god because people
already on my Twitter being like that's
harassment they still if they follow me
around like that like that - Rassman
that's not okay and blah blah blah and
you know it's just saying yeah you know
it does make me feel very uncomfortable
but I never I never use the word harass
people were saying that to me and I
thought okay this girl's comment is on
Instagram now so people are gonna find
these girls people are going to write
nasty comments to them and I saw how old
they were they're like 13 14 and I was
like I the last thing that I want is for
these girls to be harassed and I know it
happens like I never asked anyone to go
on a page and harass someone but if they
can see a comment of ghosting that was
me that did that it's very likely that
we want one person at least to jump over
there and be like why did you follow
Dani around it
so I immediately deleted the comment
because I was like oh my god if anyone
finds this girl she is gonna get
harassed and she's way too young for
that she does not deserve it at all so I
deleted the comment and I'm like okay
she's safe she's safe now so essentially
I one of these girls to be safe because
they're so young and the last thing that
I'd ever wanted something to be harassed
they don't deserve at all and no one can
see that side of it like no one can
understand that was my intention I
really hurry because yeah this Danny
wants to do that people have in their
heads like it isn't me at all and it
sounds like people are convinced that
they want to create this this horrible
version of me and I look at the stuff
about me unlike these these Danny's a
fake page or whatever and I'm like but
that's not me like I don't know who
you're talking about because that isn't
me at all and you know it really really
hurts to constantly read rumors and lies
about you especially like when you like
me and I'm like I don't think talking
about it's the right thing but we'll see
how this video goes with that also to
want to point out I was just on Twitter
someone sent me a tweet of a girl that
made a video saying she's about to
spilled the tea on me she said something
like I went to primary school with Danny
in England and we didn't know she was
being youtuber we have lots of drama to
tell about her later on tonight
um which she had the southern accent I
was a northerner some be like did we go
to primary school I don't know who she
is I've never seen in my life I don't
know what's going on right now guys like
I don't know why all of a sudden I
become such a big target and oh my god
I'm playing the victim card right now
but no legitimately if you woke up with
all this stuff happening to you would
you sit there and be silent like I don't
know what to do I don't know why people
are now making fake videos saying that
they they knew me and they're trying to
like spread gossip about things but I've
never met them I don't know who they are
don't know who they're talking about and
I'm just like why is everyone coming for
me I'm like what bad comment did I do
like seriously to to get all of this all
of a sudden awake people just like yeah
we hate to any club there's also a fake
Danny immensity channel that is writing
negative nasty comments to my
subscribers on my account so if you see
this please click on it and make sure
it's fake one or not me I would never
obviously ever write anything like that
this person's being very rude and they
have my picture and it says Danny man
see you next to it and they're
responding to my lovely scrubbers in a
really hateful way That's not me
okay basically guys I feel like in the
next few weeks I don't know what's
happening you might read a whole lot of
weird stuff about me or watch a whole
little weird stuff about me or even
apparently now watch videos of people
who know me I went to school with me
saying things about me I feel like I
even have to pull out the home videos at
the way I was when I was 12 like and
you'll see I was the shyest most Awkward
girl in school that literally sat that
ate her lunch by herself every single
day every single day and then my last
year at school I literally spent it in
the art rooms I didn't socialize with
anyone because I was just like so shy
and so awkward that I would sit and
paint during lunch time and you know
people's favorite thing to do with me
because I know that I'm such an advocate
for anti bullying and being positive
they want to ensure in any way shape or
form that they can to make it love it
I'm a bully and I'm a hypocrite there's
some things that I've read that people
write about me if I didn't know me I'd
be like oh my god Danny's a horrible
person but I read it and I'm like you're
not talking about me though like I
didn't do it I don't know who you're
talking about
this stage you guys to have you know to
question things to have an open mind in
the sense that not everything that you
you hear online especially not from
gossip channels is accurate it's all
speculation it's all you know rumors and
if you are unsure about anything that
you hear that I've done I am so honest
and so upfront I am more than happy to
tell you yes I did this no I did not do
this I did this for this reason I did
that for that reason and West you
privately about it I don't like all this
drama I hate the way that each has
become it's become so bad YouTube has
become who can shout the loudest
essentially you know who has the most
clickbait title who has the weirdest
subject for a video like I don't know
applying makeup with my furniture or
something like just something really
weird it's become this really weird
platform to people screaming for views
or screaming gossip for years because
videos that I put a lot of time and
effort into don't get any views and what
does get is gossip videos I can assure
you that this video will get so many
more views than my last video which is
the power of travel one which I worked
on for three days straight and then I
can sit down and talk about gossip and
it will blow up way more and I hate the
fact that this is what you she was
become I hated so much I'm talking for
so my camera kids time okay
I'm gonna wrap this up guys I don't
think that I am the person these people
try to portray me as I am 22 year old
girl from England living in Australia
who loves making travel videos who loves
working creative content who loves a
little stinky pub so much I love being a
positive person I just love making
people happy and I never want you know
to spread negativity or drama or gossip
or anything like that that's why I don't
talk about it I don't make story time
videos about people in my life I don't
like doing that because it I don't I
respect people to not put them on blast
on a big platform you know and I don't
I'm just like I can't believe I've had
to make this video I can't believe it's
come to this literally every single
person that I know in real life that
actually knows me and doesn't just know
me through an edited screen of what I
choose to betray has texted me in the
last week thing like I know the real you
and this is ridiculous and I can't
believe this is happening and it's so
frustrating because I feel hopefully
this video will give some insight into
my point of view and when you actually
think about it the videos themselves
aren't actually about a bad event like
they aren't about like an event that's
happened or I've done which is creating
a lot of drama it's all speculation into
things that I show so things like beans
being in the bathroom has blown up into
I'm an animal visa attached between me
and a friend blown up into I'm a toxic
person blah blah blah but there never is
something of like Danny specifically did
this at this time to this person and it
was this that happened you know what I
mean so it's it's all rumors and I hope
a lot of you can see straight through it
and understand it's really good so
rubbish yet loves loves eating that here
we're my fashion accessory or is such a
good fashion accessory pants I'm going
to go back to monitoring my pugs
Instagram account and sitting at home
all day doing nothing blocking comments
seriously guys you know the real me
you know the stuff is rubbish and if you
do hear anything in the future feel free
to ask me
I hope this close it up and I love you
guys thank you so much for sticking
around this longest video of my entire
life
I love you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
