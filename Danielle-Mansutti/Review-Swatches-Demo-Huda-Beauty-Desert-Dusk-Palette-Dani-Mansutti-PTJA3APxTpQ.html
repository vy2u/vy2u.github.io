very very very excited so speaker
because I had a very unexpected delivery
this morning and I posted about it on
Instagram and snapchat and you guys
really really want a review and I'm so
excited to review this I have never
owned any food huda beauty products
before I actually have met her under
sister we went on a trip eight years ago
the two fish perfumer in LA and he is a
little look inside the palette it is
literally like a dream come true for me
there's so many warm shades I'm just so
excited if this works me this is gonna
be like my dream palette so I will leave
some timestamps below if you want to see
your only swatches or review the demo
all that kind of stuff
then that will be down below but if you
wanna watch the whole review then just
keep watching from now and just before
jump into it if you haven't already
subscribed to my channel I would love
you to click that big red button below I
put up two new videos every single week
and I would love to have you as part of
the family and without further ado let's
dive into it literally the minute that I
opened this and looked inside I was just
like oh I thought I'd show you guys this
in natural lighting yeah here's how
everything is looking on the inside of
the palette when I open this I was just
like shocked like I'm so excited the
cosmos I did fall out of the palette a
little bit when I opened it so that's
why I've had to push it in with my
finger so that's what looks a bit weird
but I think we should start watching and
that's gonna go from row to row and I'll
do it here on my hand so you can see so
we're gonna start at the far left this
one is called desert sand the next shade
is called musk and then we have Eden
next is amber
and then oh my god I'm so excited about
this one this is the shimmer called
Blood Moon it looks so good so the Matt
so far are a little bit drier suppose
actually not too bad and really excited
about the shimmer those that see how it
goes woah oh my god you guys know how
much I love my cup of shimmers yes and
then there's this brown one it's called
like ooh door oh you did hear something
I'm not too sure how to pronounce that
one okay so here is the top row swatch
to complete on my arm and now we're
going to go straight to the middle row
which I'm super excited about because as
heaps and heaps and heaps of shimmers
this next one is called celestial and
then we have I think it's nerve fatty
next up is Twilight
so this is halfway through we're going
to go over to this color now is called
amethyst and then the one next to it is
called royal oh okay this one is very
interesting shade I've no idea how this
is going to come up it's called a
retrograde that write your grade one
it's just like a bit of a shimmer I
guess now we are moving on to the bottom
right I'm gonna start with this one here
called Kashmir that right
butum Shh he is Kashmir this next one is
called angelic and then this one I'm the
most excited about this is Cosmo which I
had to put him before and oh my god if
this is like shimmery I'm gonna be in
love
no that's so we it okay can you guys see
the texture of this it's just like
actual glitter like I swear if I just
rub it it will
that's very wait it doesn't feel it
feels like like glitter like kids
glitter not like a shimmery eyeshadow we
were doing so well I was so excited
about that shade anyway moving on and
this one is Turkish Delight that one's
nice
that one is very North then we have
saffron and then last but not least
blazin squad laden so here are the top
and the bottom swatches of the palette
from start to finish
I'm just sad about Cosmo like what
happened here I thought this would be
like like proper mmm and in terms of the
format obviously some that are a bit
more pigmented than the others I guess
some are a little bit dry I suppose like
this one at the top actually these threa
quite dry I guess and this these two as
well this one is probably the most
pigmented this one here which is Blood
Moon and this one which was Turkish
Delight are the best in terms of formula
I was gonna be completely honest with
you guys I'm not gonna tell you they're
amazing that cosmo and just really
ruined it for me because it was so
excited about it and just so reference
this is how the palette looks after
being swatched there isn't too much
fallout which is nice nothing like i'm
culture-wise not that I'm touching
myself but you guys are know exactly
what I'm talking about I'm hoping that
it will redeem itself on the eye a
little bit I'm just that broke my heart
a little bit you can actually see my
heart break into as i swatched it so
yeah let's move on to the demo okay so
let's get started on the eyes I'm going
to of course start with a transition
shade and I've just wrapped everything
off my eyes I can't really remember
what were the good ones bad my try and
use Eden first as my transition shade
and see how we go with that
I'm not darker than I thought it would
be I don't know why I didn't doesn't
look like a poet that's all I can work
with that
shadows are blending pretty well which
is nice they're not sticking onto my
skin or too dry or anything like that no
fallout as of yet thank Lord I'm gonna
use saffron now and I'll use a smaller
and intensive powder it's not too bad on
the brush
um so I'm using a sigma diffused crease
brush and I'm gonna use this on the
outer part of my eye yeah I'm actually
gonna use the map 2 to 4 brush instead
just gives a better blend with this
shadow and I'll take Eden again and just
go a little bit over that darker shade
right so I will pick up bud mode on my
finger and I will apply this straight
onto my eye
so the cars a little bit the same same I
supposed so I'll put a different color
over the top I'm gonna take this no
fatty shade so I had something else
mcpot alright let's try let's try Cosmo
on the outer corner see what happens
as of that cause my shade actually gave
quite a lot of Fallout I am a little bit
disappointed it because it does look
like so nice and the palette I'll just
clean up the edge so far here's what we
have nice and warm I will just have to
blend out this bit a little bit cuz I
don't know what's happening with this uh
but I will quickly go ahead and do some
of my bottom lash I'm gonna take Turkish
delight this time cuz we used like moon
and I will just run that along my lower
lash line
awkward so I just kind of do something a
little bit extra a little bit fun I feel
like putting a bit of a random color on
my lower lashline that lets probably get
ruin as well by the way I'm gonna take
amethyst and I'll take a little tiny
pencil brush and just to see what
happens I will run it tightly on my
lower lash line
I'll just clean these lines up and a
fall out in a second
and then I'll do the mascara and we'll
see how it looks all together I'm gonna
take angelic and that Mina corners I am
actually really happy with how the
colors turned out I think there are
really beautiful colors so yeah I have
actually quite happy with it I mean I
don't ever watch other reviews before I
review mine like I forgot a thing I
don't watch any other reviews until I
review it myself because I don't wanna
have someone else's opinion influencing
me in any way
I did have looks wait you think I did
you see this person should be or that
person's review they said it was really
bad I think it's really bad at all some
of the colors aren't as pigmented as I
would have liked like the cause my wand
I'm really confused about that cause my
shade in general because it is just such
a strange eyeshadow but I really really
love the purple I'm a fish shade that we
used to love my lashline I wish that I
use that more now on the top because it
is so nice and it is super pigmented so
I'll just do it the other day quickly
although entries in the tarts the touch
the Tarte camera lights action mascara
okay so I'm not going to apply false
lashes because I kinda want to keep this
it was like eyeshadow in me because I
feel like with false lash especially the
dramatic kind of take away from the
eyeshadow and everything like that but
now that it's complete and it's all
together I actually really like it I
think that it is really really really
pretty is my kind of colors you guys
know how I have with my warms that this
is like amazing for me so the part
itself feels good quality like it's
robust it's just like in this so much
that I feel bit flimsy this doesn't feel
flimsy at all the packaging itself is
good quality I do really love the
packaging I think honestly I can't fault
the packaging of this palette I think
it's so good and you guys know I am a
graphic designer
so the reason is like a big thing
because I'm never happy with palettes
but this just like the weight of it is a
little bit heavier than some parts just
because you know it is good quality it's
sturdy I love the image on the front and
how this reflects in the light as well I
love the mirror and I love the
the shadows laid out so to be honest I
can't pull the packaging I would give
the packaging a 10 quite simply because
I do think it's amazing and I really
like it and then moving on to what I
think of the eyeshadows and the formulas
themselves definitely don't ask because
my shade it's not my kind of thing and
when I put it on my eye it just kind of
fell on my face and I actually can't see
it and you heard what I was anymore like
can you see it anyway it's a very
strange shadow I need to understand more
about that Charlotte because I don't
necessarily understand it I'm at this
saffron amazing blood mood Turkish
delight amazing I use angelic on my
inner corners it's really pretty as well
I really like that so I think out of all
the shadows I'd say I like about 70% of
them 30% I wouldn't use a wouldn't touch
but for the most part that's still like
a pretty good result I do think the
formulas vary within the palette which
is the only confusing thing because as
you saw with my swatches some just look
better quality than others and I can't
quite understand that because I'm sure
they're all made with the same
ingredients in the same lab but there's
some for some reason that just aren't as
pigmented it is a little bit strange I
guess but who knows it could just be my
fingers being which I have no idea so
let me check how much this retails for
because how kind let might change my
opinion but let me find that out and
I'll get back to you oh my god you know
when you change your screensaver and let
me forget about it I changed my last
night every time I look at it now I'm
just like hey baby literally so in love
with Carrington now it's crazy I have a
full-blown like 12 your crush on Kit
Harington
anyway does it dust palette so you can
see how much retail but okay so as I'm
filming it's not actually out yet I
think will give me an idea so it says
it's 56 pounds so let me check what that
is for you guys in Australian dollars
because I know that most of you actually
watching this from Australia whoa
that's $91
Australian I can't be right
let me check a different website I've
just found something on the who DVD who
does who'da who de Brito comm website
and it says launching on September 18th
in the UK Harrods and Selfridges in the
UAE at dubai mall mall of emirates and
across europe and then it's also at 4 in
the US and canada and australia so here
are the prices US dollars sixty five
dollars fifty-six great British pounds
sixty four euros ninety-five and ninety
five Australian dollars two hundred and
fifty AED mm-hmm I haven't quite fully
converted into pounds yet I still see
stuff in Australian dollars I might
understand the value of it that makes
any sense so if I lived in Australia and
I'm assuming you have to pay shipping as
well for it and this was ninety five
dollars I think that if I had to save up
and pay for my own money for it I don't
think I'd buy it for $95 I feel that's
that's too much I don't know cuz I'm in
Australia like if prices of pallets gone
up a lot so I'm guessing this is much
when I was more than a normal high end
pallet at Mecca
plus you've gotta pay for shipping as
well it'll be over 100 Australian
dollars in that sense I'm assuming I
wouldn't buy it if I had to fight where
money I would pick like makeup geek a BH
morphe single shadows that can replicate
these colors because I had my doubts
about a few things and I just I don't
feel like I could justify nearly $100
for it if that makes sense like I do
think it's a good palette but I don't
think it's that good I will definitely
use this a lot but I just don't know
ninety-five dollars just seems like a
lot to me for a little palette so let's
see again so that was 65 USD that makes
no sense why is it 65 in the US and 95
in Australia hold on a second 65 USD in
AED
I'm so confused alright if you do
convert 65 US dollars into Australian
dollars it's like 80 dollars so why have
I added another $15 on top of that is
what does my sister because you guys
know that I run my own business with my
daddy Beauty lashes and stuff so I
always keep conversions like in my mind
and I don't know I just I don't know you
like I'm bringing out a product really
soon I'm so excited to share with you
guys and it's how it was cheaper than
this oh no I don't know if I can justify
$95 I guess that she has quite an image
quite like a brand you obviously you're
paying for her brand
if I were pricing this I wouldn't have
put it at over 70 Australian dollars I
would have thought 70 or under I'd say
100% get it it's worth it would you guys
say that that understands about the
Hills Modern Renaissance palette isn't
without dissimilar to this so I guess
this has like one extra row I guess I
personally don't have many abh products
I'm not a nepia and I find it very hard
to buy them nothing but anyway I know
the modern renascence one is a really
popular one really good formulas so let
me see so I'm looking at the support
Australia website and the modern
renaissance palette is 75 Australian
dollars I think I would you know pitch
anastasi as being one of the best
quality I should have brands out there
so I think yeah I can't justify this
thing 95 I know that it's really amazing
packaging I know has one extra row but
it didn't it didn't allow me to the
extent if that makes any sense
that's just my honest thoughts on it I'm
someone that doesn't like to spend a lot
of money I save one of my money I don't
wear Browns I mean I'm wearing my
t-shirt you know Danny be calm my
necklace which I wear in every single
video but for me personally I'm not that
much you're like a super high in person
so I couldn't send that much money on an
eyeshadow palette
unless I thought it was flippin
incredible but I would give the palette
a 7 out of 10 and I wouldn't yeah
I just mean $100 I put it at $70 maybe
squeeze it up for $75 but not not 95 100
but why is it but they've pitched up so
much more in Australia why do they do
this it literally makes no sense that's
what I love about Mecca is that they
actually price match their products like
all the rest of the world it's time to
you if you love spending money on makeup
and you think 9,500 is completely trying
to go for it like honestly go for it
but for me I'd rather use something like
the morphe Jeff and Hill palette or
something for that kind of price so ya
know this is my honest opinion on it I'm
sure you guys can respect that it's just
my thoughts on it I'm sure you might
think something different but I think
that's pretty much a whole review
wrapped up I haven't done like an
eyeshadow of your in a long time yeah
have you guys enjoyed let me know your
thoughts below and until next time guys
