channel I am doing a tape hair review
extension no let me start again I'm
today I'm doing a tape hair extensions
review simply because I have had them
for quite a while now and when I was
originally trying to find any
information about them on YouTube or on
the internet I couldn't find stuff
anywhere and I was like oh my god were
sort the information I've written down
here so if I keep looking down it is
because I have written down all the
questions I normally get about the tape
hair extensions so that I can answer
them for you because they're the ones
that you want to know about the most as
always if there is anything I don't
cover in this video please leave a
comment so that I can reply to you and
get back to you because I'm just not
following a secure point now I'm like
full so anything I haven't covered feel
free to leave a comment and I will reply
so I'm going to start with the price I
often get asked about how much they cost
and for me and they cost $350 to get 24
inch tape hair extensions they are $250
if I get 20 inch it is a little bit
pricey when you're thinking about every
two months you have to get them pulled
up because I start growing out they just
remove them and apply them again at the
top and that's $150 so there's a lot of
money so in all the videos you've seen
of me up until now I have actually been
wearing clippings I first got tapes a
year ago but I got them taken out about
three months ago because I just want to
give my hair a bit of a break and just
let it grow and just was getting a bit
over the extensions but now I've run
back to them so I don't know approves
that I love them okay big question is
obviously do tape hair extensions damage
your natural hair and I'm not a hair
just so many things I'm just speaking
for personal experience but for me I do
not think they have damaged my hair what
to about I first got the mid-year ago
and up until now I cannot think of
anything up until now I can't think of
anything any problems I've had with my
natural hair so just to explain to you
tape hair extensions pretty much like
sticky tape or Stella tape two of them
put together with the sticky side facing
each other and your hair is sandwiched
in the middle it's only a little thin
bit of your hair it's not a lot so just
to remove them they just put a little
bit of like tea tree oil on and they
just slide off and it's just not tugging
on your hair anything like microbeads do
or waves it just sits on your head it's
very flat very very very easy to sleep
with you just need to find someone who
can apply them correctly because you
don't want someone who doesn't know what
they're doing and some just way too much
hair in between the tape because that
will damage your hair okay so if pros
and cons with takes pros obviously it's
to have long thick hair wake up every
single day with long hair it is a great
thing because I'm sure you have tried
before clippings are horrible their
hormone takes so long to apply so to
wake up every day and have less it just
like life-changing but with nice hair
comes a few cons and for me maintenance
some of it's okay some of it is quite a
bit of a con so basically they recommend
with the maintenance that you are
brushing your hair twice a day and they
recommend that you invest in a
detangling brush like this one I have
got this one from Priceline I will link
it down below because I know it's where
you take google spikey green brush
because I've no idea what it's called I
will link it down below
it cost me $20 and I would recommend it
because it doesn't pull your hair at all
it is very very gentle with your hair
every day twice a day you have to start
from the bottom of your extensions and
then start brushing upwards and upwards
and upwards until you get
scalp just brush it and he dead hairs
yucky things like that
okay so washing your hair with tapes is
a bit of an adventure because they
aren't very heavy when they get wet and
they take a long time to dry seriously
take the day off school and just sit
there with wet hair all day because it
takes a long time to dry and also you
must invest in shampoos and conditioners
with certain ingredients you have to
make sure there are no sulfates alcohol
sodium's or parabens I think yeah I
think so because they dry out your hair
and damage your hair you'd be surprised
by how many shampoos and conditioners in
supermarkets have such bad ingredients
because they're kind of sneaky they make
a hair look nice but then go dry so you
buy more of their products it's
ridiculous
Illuminati invest in something which is
organic doesn't have those ingredients
and it's a lot nicer for your hair and
won't dry your extensions as quick when
you go to bed as well for maintenance
you must Pat your hair hence why my hair
is wavy and weird today
I haven't straightened it since I went
to sleep so the reason to put it in a
pot is to avoid damage to your Tech's
while you sleep it can happen when
you're rolling around in bed and your
hair gets caught on something and it
pulls your hair so when your hair isn't
a plat it stays in that one place
finally would I recommend tapes if you
are someone who can forge tapes and you
have time to maintain the tapes and keep
them healthy and you're not as lazy as I
have thinking with them in the past and
you want long hair which might damage
your hair then definitely go for it 100%
however if you are someone who you must
always have your hair up for work or in
a bun or ponytail very active so you
sweat a lot in your hair gets wet or you
just talk too busy for the maintenance
and I would recommend something else
with tapes as well they really only last
for about three to four months the way
that they look when you get them applied
the person you apply to your tapes will
probably tell you they last 8 to 12
months but that means 8 to 12 months of
like dead frizzy hair
so it's really sickly four months of
nice hair and then after that it's down
here all trust to if you're a one
investor so I will permanent that start
looking at something like waves or
microbeads instead because that's more
of a permanent solution um so I think
that's everything I'm trying to think of
anything else so your knowledge get
asked about the price if it damages and
what the maintenance is so of course if
I haven't covered something please let
me know so I can reply to you in the
comments I will get back to you so yeah
first to say I don't know what's going
on here like if I seriously upload
another video on Friday it's a miracle
because I do not see how I'm gonna do it
but I will try
I hope try to do it um said she's like
upwards yeah I'll see you guys this
Friday hopefully if I get around to
filming something and yeah I hope you
enjoyed a tokichi same video and a
