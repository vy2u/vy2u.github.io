channel today I have a really cool video
I'm doing a review on the Rimmel Sun
shimmer self-tanning mousse in dark I've
decided to do a full review on this
product today because I know you guys
love my do more drugs to affordable
things and this stuff is incredible it's
so so good and I'm so pleasantly
surprised by it that I really wanted to
do a review guys just to give it some
exposure and let you see how Lullaby
over there I love it I'm sure many of
you who are thick tennis or have fake
tan or how to spray tan the bus you
wouldn't know the fake tan smell is not
the nicest smell in the whole world so
when I saw it had no smell I was like
damn I need to see this work so I'm
giving it a go I've been using it now
for about a week or so looking at the
front of the self tan mousse it says it
develops in one hour and last up to
seven days it's a lightweight velvety
mousse it drives within two minutes it
has up to 24 hour moisture so
natural-looking streak free 10 it has no
self turns no I was gonna just use it in
a favorites video but I thought I wanted
to show you like a demo and my process
and most kind of stuff as well as a full
review so I just dedicating a whole
video to its I hope you guys don't mind
so I think I will show you now my demo
and my tips and tricks for the
application and if you have any more
questions that I would cover it after
the demo please let me know in the
comments and I'll get back to you so
let's jump straight into the demo so
this is my self tanning application
guide for you guys step one is prep so
hit the shower with an exfoliant to
remove the dead skin cells yum there get
in the way of an even tan application I
would say avoid oil-based scrubs as the
oil can act as a barrier I shave my legs
so I try and do it about a day before
applying the ten if you do it's right
before your skin might be a little bit
sensitive
a tanning formulation but it totally
depends on your skin type and the third
step is applying the Sun mishima mousse
so I just use the mitt and the mitts
great for just easily burning the turn
and prevents a turn transferring on to
my little pumps so I do my trick as
always with my buffing brush and I make
sure to buff in all the 10 into my skin
to make sure that it's even
I would so recommend this just grab a
really cheap big fluffy brush and it's
so good for just blending it all into
your skin without any streaks and
finally to prolong my turn as always I
just moisturize hydrated and all that
kind of stuff and I just felt like this
ten is really different from anything
that I've tried because it dries so fast
and it's really instant ten and I love
the color as well and the fact that it's
a drugstore product makes it even better
and I really do need this right now
because it's winter here and my natural
skin is very like so I have been using
this a lot so I hope you like my review
on this Rimmel ten I know that I want to
get back into doing a bit more drugstore
products and stuff because I know you
guys really appreciate that so this is
just Oh incredible and we'll chat in the
comments so I'll see you next time guys
