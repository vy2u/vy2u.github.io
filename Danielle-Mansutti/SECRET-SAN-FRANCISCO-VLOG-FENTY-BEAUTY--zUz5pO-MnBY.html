things that we've been doing
so glad that you came back
years already passed and by but I know I
can trust you even when I can tell you I
just go back to my apartment and I'm
laughing at how I'll it should like the
most basic white girl in the world
I was walking down the street with my
big bucks strawberry refresher and my
bath &amp;amp; Bodyworks bag so remember X I got
an awesome candle my shoes on my god
store in my shoes so I was wearing a
leather shoes from winter Smith before
and they absolutely destroyed my toes
like my blisters are gonna be disgusting
so I had to run somewhere and buy some
shoes
why was my voice shaking because I had
to run somewhere buy some shoes I bought
these I can tell they're gonna get so
dirty so fast but they're pretty comfy
they were from Aldo and I got some fancy
beauty stuff from Frenchy beauty I got a
foundation I also got one of the
highlighters I got those from Sephora
today and I had enough points of it like
a dry shampoo as well I'm pretty sure
but tomorrow I am going to film using
this for the first time for you guys and
we pilots log so you'll see how I feel
about it as well I'm so excited to try
this I feel like the last person the
world to try it and I'm just so excited
I still got like the forest watches
every one story ball I throw myself in
my saudi face are gonna freshen up a
little bit before tonight so i'm gonna
have a meeting with benefit in san fran
which is an hour's drive also but it'd
be um during rush hour so take a just to
get that sorry
tomorrow the pixar experience will be in
a different blog just because it has to
be so that will be later on in the year
i suppose that vlog will be up from what
i'm doing tomorrow but i'm going to
commit everything else from the san fran
trip in this vlog this will be more of a
troubled log which is cool so you're
still the best parts of San Francisco my
lord
oh my god that top lip I'm just gonna
let cover that for a second side I'm
gonna go fix Mike no see you guys later
I've only tried wood so that's why you
are currently stucked on a bin with two
towels on it just to kind of prop you up
but I really really wanted to document
like my first pencil UT experience so
here we are got the foundation shade 270
I have no idea if this is my right shade
because I just kinda picked a random I
was like this looks like an eye shape I
picked it and I could really regret that
I'm not too short so who feels nice it's
heavy I never realize how heavy that
thing so this is the bottle which I'm
sure you all seen five million times
right now my Beauty Blender is like
underneath look look what you're on
right now the patron isn't mad alright
one thing I'm about okay hello so let's
just do it I think this is in the shade
like natural or something but I have not
watched any review yet I never do until
I try it myself but it's quite runny was
a good color it looks just like my neck
thank God I'm so glad that all the tech
TV products are just on so well
considering like what we understand
store and everything and how she's
literally changing the makeup game my
props too
well happily purchase your products
because she's awesome
all right this isn't really good this is
like I'm trying to explain isn't what
this doesn't look like I'm wearing
foundation it just looks like my skin
but let's baby umbrella the suppose I
find to me for actually picking the
right shade thank God you know I did
this is my little makeup hack so if
you're in a Sephora I know I'm trying to
help you and you need to pick your
foundation shade grab a foundation that
you already have from a different brand
so like I grab the over decay or my
foundation in my shade and then I
compared it to the fancy Beauty show so
that's how big that potentially so
that's why I do I don't swatch my place
or anything so I was wearing a full face
of makeup anyway so good my lord
here's the packaging the one that I got
is mean money hustler baby I'm gonna be
using this one
well oh my god this is so nice
oops so my makeup is now done I'm so
impressed with those products like
genuinely Wow so I'm heading over to the
Pixar presto now this will all be in a
separate blog this part but when I'm
