currently hiding next day like a proud

is head
oh my god I'm shaking
my guys looking slightly different I'm
just editing the vlog so this is Monday
night so we open to Sofia the blog I'm
gonna say goodbye or anything and the
vlog was very all over the place right
now as you can see I'm not really
feeling very well hence I'm in my
pajamas already in bed already probably
guess what I don't know I didn't even
think about starting and finishing
things the right way
last week as you saw the whole blogging
process of last week we asked me was
quite a roller coaster of emotion for me
and if I'm being completely open and
honest if you're a guy stop listening
because it's going to be booyah see but
I skipped my period last month because
it was when I moved here which is what
was June and all the girls out there
here on the pill as well whenever I
skipped something the following cycle oh
my god it's like a train hit C twice as
hard emotionally like your moods are
just like all over the place for like
two months worth of hormones just and by
emotional I just mean that things really
got to me I wasn't as laid back and
children and all um and so I started
overthinking things and like I don't
overthink things anymore and I found
Mike
doing that and I just generally felt
like homesick a bit sad a bit lower a
bit lonely but it was lovely to go to
the events we've busy and be a bit
distracted but when I get home again and
also because beans wasn't around because
at the time she was with my auntie up in
Yorkshire
just having a dog around it really makes
you so much more like home and comforted
but her just being away for a little bit
was amazing for her benefit because she
had so much fun there like me taking her
home she was like no but um yeah I just
got some things going on in my life that
are kind of getting me down a little bit
and I got to the point you all heard
last week or so big there's just been a
few low moments and not knowing where to
turn or anything sooo yeah hopefully
it'll all be you know up from here but
just wanted to check in with you just
you know how things are I kind of feel a
little bit lost us whether the best way
to describe it and also I feel a lot of
pressure on myself to like succeed and
we do really well work and everything
and obviously now that I'm here it's
like a fresh light and I've got to like
make new relationships as companies and
the UK branches and all those kind of
stuff lots of expectations that I'm
putting on myself but I do hope you guys
enjoyed this vlog on sensors a little
place as I'm filming this I'm actually
currently filming like a health cake
week so you will see very soon a vlog
probably this Friday of me like health
kicking myself back into shape because
last week I was eating so rubbish and
that was affecting my mood as well so as
of this week I am training better eating

you're excited for that but I'll see you
