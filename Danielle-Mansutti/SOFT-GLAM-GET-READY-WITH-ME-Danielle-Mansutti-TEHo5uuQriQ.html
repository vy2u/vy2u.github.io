channel in today's video we are getting
ready together I have got like a soft
glam it's super easy like so it was so
easy really easy
lunch date makeup look it's like a
little bit more mini think it's a moment
when I say a little bit more I mean like
it's fifteens everyone's running around
in their shorts and pretty fast like 15
so for us it's pretty warm it's nicely
Sun every now and then so I have been
inspired to do that a kind of spring
glowing skin kind of makeup look I hope
you guys enjoy this look as much as I
loved filming it for you and if you're
not ready subscribe to my channel I
would love to have you on board I put up
a new video every single week I would
love to have you here and without
further ado let's jump into it so as you
can see today I put a little bit of like
a breakout take that off a little bit of
a breakouts are happening also got a
little break outside here to go we're
gonna make sure that we have that all
covered today nice glowy I'm excited to
just get right into it
so of course first things first we are
going to time and today I'm going to use
the cover FX illuminating primer because
it's gonna give us that glow that we so
desperately need
literally the weather in England right
now has actually been really good that
I'm filming this it's been like
mid-teens which is really good thing
I've been really enjoying that and now
I'm just into all glowy makeup and
everything so I figured this kind of
like soft glam spring would be
absolutely perfect today I just knew
something wasn't looking right then I
forgot about the headband my foundation
share I'm gonna use the top rainforest
with the sea foundation and this one is
in medium sand I really love this
foundation is quite glowy and just I
they just try this for the first time
recently and I was like how have I not
tried this ready like it is so so nice
and I love
foundations which are more of like a
medium coverage these days like I used
to be a fool like high coverage kind of
person
now I like to just kind of look like I
have nice skin you know I mean I don't
really like okay and now for the
concealer I'm gonna use my trusty it's
hot shaped tape this one is in the shade
medium and it is just and then to set
that I'm going to use this RC ma powder
just over the top I absolutely hate the
packaging of this product but it works
really well that's all that matters
where we place the concealer just to set
it and make sure that there is no
creasing for my brows I'm gonna be using
my trusty sleek brow kit okay that would
be fantastic but this is like the only
brow product that I have been using
recently I'm just so obsessed with it as
a Bennett like it is everything so it's
gonna run through the browser
alright I admit defeat
white white was the worst worse now
decision I could have made before
filming this video be gone little button
please
yes my hands are clean and my room
smells like fumes noise so we've just
filled in the brows I'm going to use the
benefit
Ready Set brow - such as ly barrels into
place and make sure they don't run away
from us all during the day then I'm
gonna take the benefit gimme brow in
number 5 cook this on the outer part of
my brows she has to make the tail a
little bit darker just search of the
face I'm going to use the it cosmetic
cosmetic it cosmetics bye bye pause
illumination powder so the powder is
like when I open it the powder is like
white like that and it just makes it so
that your whole face just look past it
I'm going to apply it in these like
dabbing motions not pulling motion and
this will just I don't know if any of
you like me but it's not until I get it
my videos do I realize I sing my
instructions so much fantastic but I do
it like during daily life is what I sing
everything well I'm not like thinks I
can't sing but I make everything it's
like a little game - is that really
weird I feel like that's really no one's
gonna be like I relate to that Rosie
back daddy are you okay amazing my
pimples have gone
watch our pimples though we are gonna
quickly do a little bit of contour I
mean take the hula rookie contour stick
I'm gonna offer so nice having
bare hands now I'm just going to firstly
run this down the sides of my nose
and then using the same powders before
I'm just gonna use that to help blend
that now it's time to use the Too Faced
chocolate Soleil bronzer and I love this
like upgrade on their packaging this is
just so beautiful isn't it
oh my god I love it so we're just gonna
pop a little bit on my cheeks and then
bring it up to our temples as always and
then up to the four edge made me go from
like I've been on holiday for two months
to I haven't seen the Sun into me
I'm also gonna take the two-faced son
bunny which again is in its new
packaging so beautiful I'm gonna use
this with a really big big big big big
big brush and I'm just gonna lightly Pat
that over the top because this will give
us really glowy bronze the highlight I'm
going to use the artist feature cocoa
filling a diamond glow powder my life
like I love love this stuff so much I
mean come on come on all right I'm gonna
blend that out and sackbut I'm just
gonna pop the rest on I'm like a glow a
little potato right now no I'm just
gonna grab my powder brush from before
this will have to lend out any excess of
the highlight okay so this is now
looking a lot better than it did before
now we just look very little but not as
like BAM so it's time to eyes my
favorite so we're doing like a soft glam
I'm kind of thing today
sooo I figured I would use the Too Faced
natural eyes palette I received this a
few days ago in the mail I have not used
this yet but it looks absolutely
stunning but they are all like mostly
shimmer
I'm gonna start with this strip poker on
my eyes then I might use Kashmir bunny
and then these two so I'll be using the
morphe M 505 brush
I might just put this on with my finger
so it is very pigmented which is lovely
and then I'm gonna take push up and pop
this on the outer part
and then silk teddy I will just pop on
my inner corner so this is looking like
really really really nice and soft I'll
just take a little bit more strict
profile then I'm taking the strip poker
on a little like pencil brush but
underneath my eyes I'm just gonna pop
this along and kind of stop Midway and
for my mascara I'm using of course the
benefit of bad girl bang this mascara is
hot it's just ridiculous how good this
is with bad girl bang it took me a
little while to actually understand how
to use it properly once you've got on
one layer like this you want to keep
going back in and building and building
and building so the best thing to do is
to wiggle it like this all the way to
the ends of your lashes and it makes
your lashes look so long but I'm
absolutely like obsessed so in love with
this mascara but it is one that will
grow and you trust me
I find for like everyone that I've
recommended it to the first like one or
two times people tend to not fall in
love but just stick with it because it's
all about the application
I hate looking at me when I don't let's
go around because I just feel like I do
not look like myself but literally as
soon as these boys are done I'm like
hello I am back so for a step I do not
do very often we're going to do blush
this is the new benefit Gold Rush it is
so beautiful look at that oh my god I
feel like it might she's my crush
actually doesn't it it's so pretty the
mirror right there okay this smells so
good oh my god this doesn't one my
parents didn't think benefit had like
smell in their products but that's not
amazing and so
drumroll it is time well
the one thing that's gonna tie it all
this look it let's line the bad boys
first I'm gonna take my top off BFF to
look at it is not the best design
lipliner in the world but it is the best
color so yeah it's really annoying
always like falls out of this thing like
that and I have not tried this before
but I'm absolutely dying to this is the
NYX soft matte lip cream and this one is
in the shade carbo now this could be a
little bit too light and if it is I'll
pop something else
over the top but there's only one way to
find out and that's by applying it so
this is the my life is ava colour-pop
collab I actually have not and hello
although focus would you like to work
please thank you I've not actually tried
this before
it doesn't like a really nice color
though this is probably gonna end up
being too much as well Oh
and then of course we have to put on the
Urban Decay all nighter setting spray
and no makeup look is complete without
it and just like that we have got a
super super super easy software girlie
easy daytime makeup look so hope you
guys enjoy this video I always have the
most fun in the world to fill makeup
tutorials for you and I am now off to
grab some lunch I'm so excited to stuff
Nando's in my face like give me all the
chicken I'm so excited until next time
