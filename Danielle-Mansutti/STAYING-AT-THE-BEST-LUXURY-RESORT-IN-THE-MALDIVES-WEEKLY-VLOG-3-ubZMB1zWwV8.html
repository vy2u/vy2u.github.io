excited what do you think product is oh
no flipping clue
I like well I'm not gonna lie I did make
a comment because it's outer space I was
like maybe it's a powder made with moon
dust
I think SMC with highlight like glowy
shimmery something to do with eye shadow
perhaps yeah if I have to guess I'd say
it's a like a thing is we were told that
it's something that's never been done
before and we were told that it was
something that we always complain about
not having the instrument these are my
video queens of self-deprecation no idea
but I'm so excited it could even be like
some kind of tanning
Oh baby yeah over then out of this world
well you've got to think it's we're in
the Maldives and the u.s. own then you
do not it looks like Mars that was a
space thing oh yeah it's something bad
it sucks cuz my time is up you gotta

the water all the way over to where our

looks like we're gonna be in the water
in that restaurant
good morning everyone
I'm absolutely struggling to get all of
that glitter residue from last night
last night was so much fun it was just
amazing and the mascara is amazing I'm
wearing it wearing it today okay
actually can't see the screen at all but
hopefully you can see me but I'm wearing
the mascara today which was the big
revealed product and it is really all
really cool today we are back to reality
is being such an incredible trip but
it's not over yet we haven't got a
castaway brunch today which would be
really really cool so I'm pretty sure
we're having lunch in the water or
something or on a beach and then we get
back to London like 7:00 we should leave
it's actually flown by it the same but
anyway we're off to the brunch now last
night was really really fun my lord it
is hot today
I know it's like hit me when I get back
because if you you know that I get back
on Saturday and on Tuesday I go to
Australia my body temperature is gonna
be so confused cuz England it's freezing
right now I think I'm definitely not
gonna be wearing this on the plane today
got me a little change but let's go to
oh my god I just fell over I think the
reality sit sit sit
did I just turn Kiwi the reality sets
and when you see your luggage my arm
actually leaving
real life you know the movie passageway
but it'll literally like an untouched
beautiful island so you can see because
of global warming and their sea levels
rising the support island is actually
getting like pushed back and you can see
all like the bottles of you know rubbish
around which is so sad because it's just
such a beautiful place but a lot of
motors might exist racing which is
really sad because it's my favorite
place in the world
yes like legit natural jungle just never
been anything touched this is crazy I
feel this is like heaven it's so like
natural and beautiful
we can plan
