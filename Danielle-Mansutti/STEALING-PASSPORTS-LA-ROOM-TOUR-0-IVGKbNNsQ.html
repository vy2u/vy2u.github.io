because it's such a short trip it's only
a few days I put down business on my
like entry card because obviously I'm
right here in Holiday and I was get
scared that I'm going to get like
interrogated for it but for damn
business and fluid scared but went
through the immigration and normally in
the u.s. immigration are pretty like
hardcore they like interrogate you a lot
so I was expecting that and the guy that
I had an immigration was asking me like
a million questions I started to get
really nervous if you go to look at me
and be I should have no any why but I'm
like there's no way I'm going to get in
a like really good and then he grades um
okay so why are you here and I explained
I have an event on Wednesday and I'm
youtuber and all this kind of stuff and
he's like I have to ask you something
but you have to answer it a hundred
percent truthfully and I was like oh my
god oh my god what if I done what am I
done on the criminal can i real
plus one day or event I was like
thinking what the hell that is how it
was just like awesome and it was just
some way and he was like actually Jeff
grant us he was like people be watching
this because I can't like what YouTube
and work on self that was very unusual
and didn't expect that at all and it was
very hilarious so we had a great
