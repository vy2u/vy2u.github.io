I have my September favorites so excited
to tell you about sorry these are all
Beauty favorites the one thing which
isn't a beauty favorite but it sort of
is oh no you see okay let's jump
straight into it my first favorite is
the English MC eyeliner gel in 77 you
would have noticed this and a lot of my
tutorials lately because I'm a professor
that guys I could not go back to using a
hundred pins I know it took me so long
to use eyeliner gels but then sorry the
absolute perfect combination is this gel
with the zoeva three-one-seven winged
liner brush they're just a match made in
heaven
they work so well together and with this
brush because of the tip it is
absolutely perfect at making a wing and
just one stroke I absolutely love this
I seriously everyone needs this brush in
their life it is so so nice my next
favorite is the a blast ambient lighting
powder in dim light this is just the
most incredible powder I use it for
setting my skin like a pressed powder
and as my friend Maddie said it makes
you like you're always in good lighting
it's really weird it's like a really
reflective glowy lighting powder like
it's just on the box duh I found that
when I do set my foundation with this I
just look really really like the low E
and like I have a permanent ring light
followed me around kind of thing that's
not like your shiny it's like you're
glowing like you're an angel
next I have this bad boy which is the
batiste dry shampoo in coconut and
exotic tropical this smells more good
I used to hate dry shampoo and you just
feel like it does not work for me of
those he's using that wrong brand I saw
a lot of people you to ease this friend
and so I use it and it is so good the
first time I used it I used white too
much I had like a gray string down the
front of my hair and it
like I had the worst grow rebirth ever
especially now that I'm going to gym a
lot my hair gets so greasy a lot quicker
just because I'm all sweaty and gross so
this has been like the best thing for me
and I really like the smell as well I
bought it from Kohl's I think it was
like ten dollars next thing is the Sigma
medium brow powder so I'm very lucky to
receive products from Sigma and they
sent me this meeting brow powder and now
I'm so many sort of is a bit scared of
like going out of my comfort zone you
guys know my dip brow is like my life so
I was like I don't know paddle work
makes I've never really found a powder
that does the job but what I love about
this brow powder is that I use this for
my tail and this for the front of my
eyebrows and it creates a really cool
gradient effect when you use a really
dark color from the tail to the front of
your eyebrow it just looks too fake I
think I really love the duo within this
and I'm seriously think it's the best
color combination for my eyebrows my
eyebrows are a lot darker than my hair
next we have this beautiful little boy
called the Maybelline fit me foundation
we met and pull this version without a
doubt my favorite drugstore foundation
of all time I absolutely love it and in
my arm
first impressions you guys were like why
did you call it 3-1 10 I was like oh
yeah it's just three one zero this is
perfect with Bondi sans tan color they
works I'm wearing loving tan right now
I'm giving that a go so this is like
more reddish so this is when I have my
bond essence I always lean towards this
I can seriously say it's a dupe for
double wear except don't have a
flashback like double wear so it's
better than double wear I have normal
skin it works really well for me however
my mum has quite dry skin and then she
used it and she didn't like it because
it was too dry because it's Matson pores
so if you do have dry skin maybe try the
QE version my next favorite is this a
beautiful big morphe palette in 35 t its
colours are amazing
this is the best warm palette ever this
is just like me in a palette
you've got your shimmies but you go to
pinks you've gotten Browns your warranty
Purple's it is just over perfect for a
warm smoky eye and everyday look and I
absolutely love with multi how it is so
affordable yet so pigmented my absolute
favorite Road is this right here these
shimmers are just absolutely beautiful I
honestly continuing with eyeshadow I
have the makeup geek eyeshadow in magic
act is actually is like the perfect
golden shimmer
it is sorrow pigment and the swatch it's
just amazing is it just so mainly the
other day with the transition shade and
it was so effective even though it is
that's just a basic gold shimmer shade
it's just so beautiful and the sucker
for gum chewers if you haven't already
realized so love it absolutely love it
and continuing on with makeup geek we
have creme brulee aka the most perfect
transition shade I've ever found in my
life
this is something I saw so many
youtubers using and I'm like why is it
every single you should be use that
creme brulee show and then I tried it
and I'm like oh that's it because it's
amazing I do compare it's like a peanut
butter shade in the semi-sweet palette
by Too Faced it's just my perfect little
transition color this color and magic
act together I just like the most
beautiful combination and they are
really affordable as well so now which
you guys can smell for your YouTube
screen the best candle in the whole
world this is the Morgan and Finch Lumia
fragrance candle in gardenia is so so
nice I'm a soccer fight vanilla caramel
Sanson I've never really ventured into
this kind of scent but it's so beautiful
if I bought this brand from Bed Bath and
table I just went into this door and
like sniffed every single other candles
I'm not that weird girl that does that I
just walk into shops and I'm like that
cause you need any help I'm like I'm
just here to stick the candle
I've been burning it everyday since I
got it I really don't want to finish it
I also really love the last house
candles this is the Tahoe vanilla
caramel one and it's kind of burnt as
well I'm an absolute liking for candles
love swayed sense so do you guys have
like a candle they always lean towards
like a certain scent I know that Michael
realized lavender and I hate it's a
lavender
can you leave below what your favorite
thing is because of your really
interesting to see but vanilla is like
the best ever sent in my opinion
beautiful and last but not least we have
the Too Faced Born This Way at
foundation now I did a first impressions
on this foundation a few months ago
literally the day I got back from PT
geek I did a first impression to review
on this but I was so used to using my
nose on my Estee Lauder that I just sort
of didn't really go to it at all no one
knows just doing my makeup and I thought
oh I might try the Born This Way
Foundation again and I was like this is
better than double we're like why am i
continuously wearing double wear this
looks so much better on my skin so my
shade isn't gone and as I said in my
first review in my first impression
review
I can't believe as coconut water in it I
just think that is so cool that has
coconut water in it but it has no
flashback it lasts all day and it looks
so nice on the skin because it's not
cakey and do you find that my sa a lot
of double work can look a little bit dry
and cakey on my skin sometimes all my
photos lately and on my videos lately
this is what I'm wearing I just love
this and because I'm wearing loving 10
at the moment I'm just giving it a shot
I'm finding that this golden shade
matches that color of 10 really really
really well
and so that is my favourites for
September I really hope that you guys
enjoyed it please let me know which
product are surging and you really want
to try it or you're really interested in
