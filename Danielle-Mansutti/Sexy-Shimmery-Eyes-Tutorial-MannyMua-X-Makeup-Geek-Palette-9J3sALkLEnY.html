welcome to today's video is all about
this a little boy right here and this
palette is many a makeup artist
collaboration with makeup geek I was
like over the moon when I received this
and I was so excited I had to film with
it I love man in everything he does I
thought I would a hundred percent films
video and get some more word out about
his little palette so here's the inside
of the palette we've got our crowns our
shimmers and our reds and this is
something which I feel like Woody's
everyday because these are like my kind
of colors I love it I come up with this
I look and I'm really loving it like I
really really really do like it and I
love this palette so much so if you are
interested in seeing how I achieve this
makeup look then please keep watching so
here is a real beautiful palette that
we'll be using today and it is
absolutely out of this world it's so
beautiful and I am so excited to be
playing with it today I have no idea
what kind of look at that I want to
create but I'm loving this shade in the
middle which is called Sora I really
like this red but I'm feeling like they
work together I have no idea though I
think I might begin with peaches and
cream in the top here and I'm really use
this as a transition shade time to put
on the head I'm gonna start by using a
sigma diffused crease brush I didn't
throw my eyelids be right back okay I'm
back I'm back I'm back I'm just going to
briefly put on the Mac soft ochre paint
bottle my eyelids really quickly I won't
be too long my comments okay so let's
pretend that didn't happen I just
quickly put soft ochre Paint Pot on my
eyes and now I'm grabbing the beaches
and cream shade
just pull a sit in my crease okay change
of plan I'm gonna use frappe instead and
it looks like this in the palette I just
think it'll give me a better color
payoff in my crease oh yeah yeah we did
it guys we did it
so again winds Creek watch to wind
screen wiper motions yeah that's the
word I was looking for right so I
originally said I was going to use that
wrapper color on my lid but now I have
it on my crease so I'm having a look at
the palette and you guys are always like
stop it with the pings so I should
probably not use that thing today hey
I'm thinking this red for some reason is
just looking at me staring at me and I
feel like it could go either way
should I do it so this shade is called
Mars and I'm using a sigma short shader
brush and I'm just going to dip that in
hey guys something
I'm going to use this super dark shade
called Aphrodite put this in my outer
corner see here we go
then I'm going to try and blend this out
but I put a lot on some hoping it will
blend I love how I shadow always looks
crazy what if I can't we're done you're
like I love you been punched in the face
so we're gonna fix it up a little bit
I'm going to use my concealer which is
the Rimmel wake me up concealer and I'm
just going to place this around you so
I'm gonna start right about here with my
lower lash line is and then I'm going to
follow it upwards but it's nice and
straight it looks like you know what she
doing this is looking pretty cool right
now I'm loving how pigmented eyeshadows
are I feel like I got to use the shimmer
shade because I just have to be like why
not maybe this one at the top
that looks amazing that shadow is crazy
I didn't even have to put on my fix plus
square anything I'm loving that what
such a cool Artemis Artemis Artemis whoa
I'm loving this I'm not gonna do
eyeliner cuz I feel like I'm just going
to ruin everything if I do that
inserting put on some the sky this is a
lash domination by bare minerals firstly
I'm just going to do my top lashes then
I'm going to come back after we do more
face makeup and then continue on with
the lower lash line because otherwise
when I put a powder over I shadow it's
just like this isn't happening not gonna
work my lashes today I'm going to use
these and these are in the style boiler
bula-bula boiler I've actually had a
brain fart I've forgotten how to
pronounce it it is like why that isn't
it I'm going to finish off my skin
makeup now somebody's the Rimmel wake me
up concealer I used to sort of clean
everything up before with and I'm going
to do a blush
I'm taking my concealer brush and I'm
just going to blend this out into a
triangle section then I'm just repeating
it again on this side
I'm gonna be using the Too Faced
chocolate Soleil and I'm going to take a
Smashbox this is a face and cheek brush
I'm just gonna go ahead and a bronze
ourselves up um without realizing it my
eyeshadow it matches my background that
I'm going to contour up my nose with the
same bronzer now going my trusty
mary-lou manizer for my highlight I'm
going to use a contour brush I'm just
going to let me DAP this on my cheekbone
oh also adding some down my nose now
that I've done my contouring my
highlight and what kind of stuff I'm
going to move back onto underneath my
eyes I just really hope I'm not going to
ruin this because it's so free I might
start with the shimmer and see how that
looks
I'm going to put the red shade
underneath and see how that works I'm
just doing this super light cause it
ought to be too pigmented otherwise they
may look a bit like a bunny rabbit
I think that red shade is the way to go
so an eyeliner I could either really
enhance it or just ruin it so for my
lips I'm going to firstly align them
with the spice lip liner by Mac I'm
going to apply the foam lipstick by Mac
and I'm so excited to use this because I
haven't actually used it yet I bought it
in June 3 at Bali and I'm so excited to
use it
yay finally okay you're just not talking
so I can do this and now I'm like oh
over the top so of course a massive
thank you to all of you that have stayed
around to the end I appreciate it so
much and I'll be seeing you guys really
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
