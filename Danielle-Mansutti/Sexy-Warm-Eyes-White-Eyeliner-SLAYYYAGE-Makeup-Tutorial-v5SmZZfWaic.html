have only be my brand image and design
because it's what I've ever filmed
because it was not intended to end this
way but it kind of did and I'm just
gonna like a winner gonna work with it
so I hope you guys enjoy that further
ado let's get into it the headband is
ready to come so recently I have been
using this foundation which is the x1 in
Jersey where a liquid foundation and my
goodness I'm obsessed because I love it
so sure that I would be using in this
foundation say is for and this is like
the perfect choice meets as you guys
know I like to turn and I love how you
get while cuz my friends is a lot more
kind of like yellowy olive undertones oh
I believe the title of this foundation
because I find this works completely
fine zone and it is just super glowy and
natural which is why I love lipstick as
it is currently somewhere in the UK I
like to look as glowy as possible some
simple lemons into my skin you can see
how well it's right to my neck because
obviously was a little bit why it
doesn't kind of matte and cakey or
anything like that which is not just has
this kind of shine to a local best some
carnations so good and also when I was
do my research on foundation what I
think it's really different and cool
about it is that this Elvises that uses
foundation so people like the weekend
and jake gyllenhaal use it on the red
carpet on food nation is on I can't get
enough however this is like literally
every time other where I'm just like wow
glowy and buildable as well like only in
certain areas that I need of kind of an
extra layer on top for the most part and
I really need like one layer
the whole thing because it doesn't do
anyway something that I really want to
tell you next about because I have a
films and makeup video in a long time
and this is a foundation that I switch
to for pretty much a lot of the time
that I've been in England I've been
wearing this bad boy so I just want to
tell you all about it I love it
I've said I will make them in
description to further into a motive if
you are interested to buy yourself video
onto it concealer today I am using
specific focus focus focus my type
shake type concealer this one is in the
shade fair city to do the light
difference in my spot anything like that
I'm just going to go ahead and believe
this is super excited to wreak right be
I should have look that we're going to
make today's all because when I wore it
other day I was so happy with your
reaction to when I was writing on
snapchat and stuff and you guys like oh
my god please no Matt so sometimes
moving on it to eyebrows guess here is
back on the dipbrow bandwagon ladies
okay but it's really being so long
because I use my dip brow and I just
like where you come into everyday my
drawer I was like how is this like I
packed it with me to bring here I was
like I haven't use it so long so I just
try it and I was like I'm sure as you
know I do have a full in-depth Ivar oil
if you would be if you would be like to
do it if you would be interested to see
that I will leave a card just above this
if you'd like to click on that because
I'm is actually an eraser it is as
quickly as I can the Browns are now on
and for past day I'm using the x1 pure
crushed minerals powder foundation this
one is slightly jarred my foundation I
use the shade 5 for my partner just
because I know I feel like it works a
lot better for my skin is kind of also
designed for those with more of a
yellow olive I'm tired it's like the
foundation as well so to my face is
looking all-time yellow today so me it
works really really well too ah and
almost like myself you need to get a lot
of trust me and you can see as I am
applying this powder that everything
that's just sort of setting into place a
little better exercise like I like this
adds a little bit of extra coverage
because when I wear a setting powder I
definitely do anything like what is
bling seriously what a lot of it is is
that you can see it all just looking
nice and no no I did try to powder in
fall but somewhere then it's the shade
and fire just work I was noticing and
doing you in and nice and close you can
see like HPV gel on my you know it's a
little bit terrifying
you can see how flowy natural and skin
like it is that is the most importantly
I hope cakey makeup joy Michael it takes
in your lines everything it just like
all of us because we all know that and
seriously they were they ever especially
I would get like small eyes here in here
there's a definition that we have a
flawless base it is time to chisel some
shape my bronze at the moment I'm
currently using this bareMinerals and I
was not my color at all but I just
really like some reason it is the
invisible bronze this is actually in
dark deep which you know if you read
that after but that's not for me but I
will send this little while ago and I
tried it and loved it it's not too heavy
or anything like that so I just really
like the color it is like a true brown
which i think is the most important
thing because so also new kind of course
bronzes that are like orange
that you think more definitely won't go
in my application to the chocolate
country so you can take not too dark at
all that's just a really nice sort of
brown shade a little more of a temple
then whatever we want to do I'm
scrubbing a flat brush using it in sang
Franz up and up and down along the sides
of mine are always amended out
I just series of how I do stuff in the
eyes I'm just like okay I was going to
be finicky storms are for synthetic as a
glove highlighter long long long name
and I like to use this side of it to let
your really do my Commodore warm deep
side Tom Wow and the kids are doing
wasn't really bronze the earth lamb more
like this deep orange shade as far as
over the river the classic sort of
silvery color shades not really forever
on camera but in person might not suit
origin at time I finally I'm so tired
it's Thursday I'm going to succeed I
browse amusing with benefit
ready set Brown and then just to make
sure there's no like gaps everything
last minis the benefit gimme brow and
I'm going to just again still in any
nigga sport
so notice over you guys and nice and
close and super personal to do our eyes
together because I just feel like so far
away it's going to be like what are you
doing
so let's start by priming our eyelids
I'm going to use a Smashbox photo-finish
a lip primer in light a little bit of
this on
I lose and then I'm going to blend it
alone now this is where all the fun
starts I'm going to be using this takes
me back to Brazil palette by BH
Cosmetics I mentioned in a blog recently
and you guys like I want to see it so
bad
Gary for this overall so beautiful
colors so obviously I'm going to be
working with this region here with reds
oranges and yellows
Despard Oh who the are you today is
this very warm yellow here and then I'm
actually going to just go across use
orange and in the red and I'm starting
with a sigma tapered blending brush like
this it is any e-40 blending brush and
I'm going to dip that in the yellow I'm
going to extract off any excess because
I want to be like certain character I
apologize again for the lighting Oh
little bit not ler and I'm just going to
go ahead and apply the yellow to my lid
now this is something that does makes me
built on quite a lot because as you can
see putting yellow straight on to skin
color doesn't really transfer that well
sometimes so I'm gonna keep building it
up as I go okay so the yellow is on our
legs
not only in any particular place it just
needs to be above the crease because I'm
going to put the orange on the crease so
now I need the Mac to - for the lending
brush I moved it with that orange shade
that you guys saw before and once again
applying this to the same area but a
little bit lower than last time and then
and I'm swirl it around and blend it in
but I do want to make sure that the
yellow does remain higher than the
orange because otherwise we'll lose the
yellow like completely and there won't
be a grating thing we'll do we're going
to go ahead and keep blending it in
so now that we have a nice fade on our
crease we are more than ready for this
really amazing red shade and I did tweet
a little while berry since then why is
it like out of every part I've ever
owned every red is not red but it's like
pink or orange or something but this
bread is pretty damn red and applied
with my finger just let it get almost
color pale and I'm grabbing the orange
on my blending brush again I'm going to
make sure everything is blended together
the crease to even things up a little
bit and actually going to use a dark red
from the meat matrimony palette he's a
match Kumar you can't just use a brown
or a dark path or anything you want but
the Brazil power important's happening
dark shades for the red so I'm turning
it from a disparate and I'm going to go
and pop this on on the outer part of my
eye and then focus it inward and then I
was going to make sure to surrender
school
so we haven't lost any that yellow once
again and to season see how the shadows
looking from a little bit further away
the super warm bright fluorescent I love
it like this so cool
you think a Sigma small tapered blending
brush and going to use the orange shade
on my lower lash line but then I will
follow it up with the rest well
and that's type of lucious I want to set
up with the Too Faced better than sex
mascara and I'm always with the big hold
all seasons so excited to really bring
fold a little together I feel like I
literally have not filmed in my cut
tutorial it's so long that I feel like
sometimes I'm ever doing it again I'm
actually like really shy though with you
know what is so random and otherwise the
side of it but I kind of feel like this
is you know not really that exciting I
want to do something really different
actually never even travel people
what am I doing here Robin because I've
seen if he's what I like a cut crease
connecting it looks really cool
I don't know idea watch a shooters or
anything so horribly wrong but let's do
it on camera anyway so this is a
toothpaste sketch burgers she told
little white alive don't even overwork
club mm okay let's say
do this
okay we have to clean up with my seconds
a little okay that just happened
um I kind of felt like doing something
different I've never attempted this
before I don't really know what I'm
doing either right now just a giggle
I feel like I should have a little bit
of what eyeliner might lead to Dallas
what the ruin of so I saw what a
festival makeups thrown out of there
look oh do I leave it like this
what's wrong all right let's
deliberately what am i doing on our that
I've noticed artistically on skarphol
when we die Oh
I kind of like it I didn't like it like
turning really festival really fast and
don't need very much but I'm not
complaining I mean it's fun to cut my
thumb might um be like okay let's go
with it something was calling my name's
while I was like you know what let's do
this I'm going to add my eyes eyelashes
and shade in the style wild if I'm wrong
but as you can see it's kind of
disappeared the he is how they delicious
look I thought Mike and see what they do
to this I look and literally cannot get
the waffles out of my head so we now
have the lashes on and the last thing to
do in delay it I think Mikey's been
taking nude because I don't know what
I'm doing my dad's like formal so the
time I'm going to go ahead and apply the
top lip paint in the shade let's see my
lips whose just such a good
and that's why the max 5 amid lineup of
the scoop just like that we have got one
of the most random and weird math twirls
that I've ever filmed it was such a plot
twist it just went from like this smoky
red eye to is from what eyeliner
unpredictable and strange and as my
cursor was I hope you guys enjoyed it
enjoy something really different because
I just don't know why this like massive
feeling she's only oils and I'm like
let's do it so I hope you guys can go to
slip I'll see you over soon and have an
amazing day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
