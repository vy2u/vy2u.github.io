hello everyone happy Halloween in
today's video I have a skeleton makeup
tutorial to share with you I'm just
getting ready for a Halloween party and
I thought I would film that get ready
with me and this is a recreation of
crispies amazing easy skull Halloween
swirl which I will link below she's
incredible you have to check her out I
wasn't planning on filming a tutorial
for Halloween but because I'm getting
ready for a Halloween party I was like I
should probably feel like everybody's
all film this but I do really hope you
guys enjoyed get ready with me today out
of that further - let's jump into it I
was a joy a brand new Beauty Blender can
bring I'm using a really light
foundation today which is something that
I never say on this channel I'm actually
using a foundation lighter than my skin
I'm doing this because when we're doing
shadowing later it's going to be a lot
easier with a very light base and I'm
going to be blending this foundation
down to my neck to make sure everything
is the right color next I'm moving on to
brows and I'm using the Anastasi over
hills dipbrow and dark brown and just
filling in my eyebrows like I would any
other day and after this I'm going to go
in with the shape tape from Tarte and
I'm going to apply this underneath my
eyes to make them even whiter and
brighter before applying the Kat Von D a
translucent powder over my skin to set
everything into place I'm now taking the
Kat Von D shade + light eye palette and
I'm using the contour shade to create a
transition in our crease this is a
really beautiful warm orange color and
it's going to use this as a transition
because weren't we doing a super smoky
eye today and then I'm moving on to the
define shade and I'm just applying this
in the crease as well not as high as
orange shade but this is just a deep and
dark and everything up a little bit now
moving on to the older sibling we're
using the big shade and light palette
and I'm using it shacks which is the
black shade I'm going to be packing this
onto my lid and black is always a really
fun color to play with said no one ever
so I'm going to be sitting here
blending it out for a very very very
long time I'm using the TARDIS
eyeliner and my waterline and then
applying the same a contour shade as
before on my lower lash line and then
going in with a full
lack is well on my lower lash line and
I'm creating a gradient from the black
shade to the contour shade now with the
toothpaste better than sex mascara I'm
just going to apply a coat onto my
lashes before applying any falsies so
I'm speaking sure the top and bottom
lashes are coated and then I'm using the
I spy lashes in Midnight which are
perfect for a smoky eye they are so
beautiful so I'm just applying midnight
onto my lashes and then after this we
are moving on to the nose so we're going
to map out a lovely hole in our nose as
if we were skeletons I honestly had like
no idea what I was doing here but I just
sort of went with what I thought well
look okay and then applied some liquid
eyeliner and then some black eye shadow
over the top and then continuing on with
the black eye shadow and now using it to
map out my cheekbones and do an ultra
ultra ultra dark contour so as you can
see I'm just following my cheekbones
down in the unnatural shape that they
are and then I'm continuing to blend the
black downwards kind of cheated and just
packed on a whole heap of that contour
shade with big brush just to make sure
it was all there and then with my beauty
blender to blend it together and then I
just kept going with different Browns
from the shade and light palette started
from obviously darker at the top and
then gradually went lighter at the
bottom to achieve that really nice
shaded cheekbone effect
I then also apply the same kind of
shading to my chin and just sort of do
the same thing with the black and the
contour shade and then blended them all
together and then after this I also
added some into my frown lines to make
myself look very angry and scary so I'm
putting my frown lines and I also put a
bit of shading on my forehead just to
sort of make it look a bit more
realistic and add more depth into my
face next it was time to add some teeth
so I'm just using a liquid eyeliner and
using parallel lines to create the teeth
effect and I have quite sticky out lips
naturally so this is a little bit
difficult for me so I did end up going
in with the eye shadow palette
afterwards and adding some shading just
using the contour shade once again to
create a little bit more depth because
the lines weren't very straight for me
but if you have flat lips and they'll be
straight for you and you don't have to
worry about this but I just sort of
additive shading to see how it would
look and that is the finished look I
really hope you guys enjoyed this little
get ready with me I had so much fun
filming it and I'll see you all very
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
