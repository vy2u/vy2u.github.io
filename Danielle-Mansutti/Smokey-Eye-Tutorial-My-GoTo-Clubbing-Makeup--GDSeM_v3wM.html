channel if we're doing really well I'm
going having tonight so I thought
amazingphil and smokey eye tutorial well
I'm Anna and as you probably are well
aware I have not a professional makeup
artist therefore I make mistakes too so
I wanted to show you what I do when I do
make mistakes during the smokey eyes
because working with black eye shadow is
like a little earlier but you guys
enjoyed this tutorial and let's jump
straight into it
so to start with I'm using the shade
Morocco with a domed a shadow brush from
Real Techniques I'm gonna use this as my
transition shade in my crease and I
found this a little bit hard to blend
for some reason so as you can see I'm
going back and forth back and forth and
back and forth a little bit more so we
just have their very natural sort of
deep crease color
moving on to fudge I'm using a multi m41
three brush I'm placing this in my
crease directly it's just going to
darken up the look and it also makes
your eyes look a ton bigger so we're
just adding shades as we go and just
blending and blending and blending and
taking it very slow then I'm using a
shade called soft peach and I'm just
using this under my brow bone just to
clear up all that mess then I actually
took an England eyeliner if we've got to
show you on the screen and I'm using
this directly all over my eyelid to make
sure that the outlook will be super
black when we use the noir black shadow
on top of it here so I have tissue paper
underneath my eye to prevent fallout and
I definitely recommend this because my
goodness working with black is a really
difficult
then I'm taking a clean blending brush
and I'm just ensuring that I have all my
colors blended together we don't want to
see where the colors end or start so
just keep blending until it all sort of
just joins together naturally then
taking my concealer I'm just going to
put this underneath my eyes and I'm
doing this to clean up all the eye
shadow because it is a little bit
Messier and all over the place and this
just ensures we have nice clean crisp
lines taking Morocco once again I'm
using this with a pencil brush
underneath my eye so just along my
waterline and then I'm also going to
fill it in afterwards with an eyeliner
on my waterline just to darken up the
bottom section
now taking pink champagne the shade is
so gorgeous I put this on the inner part
of my eyes just for a little bit of
sparkle and then I just applying a bit
of mascara over the top before applying
some false lashes I got glue all over my
eyelid guys
sorry guys enjoyed this smokey eye
tutorial please let me know any requests
down in the comments and I'll be singing
really soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
