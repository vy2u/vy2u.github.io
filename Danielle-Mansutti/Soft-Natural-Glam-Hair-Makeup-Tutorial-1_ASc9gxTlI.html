in today's video I have a really soft
pretty natural makeup look to share with
you I know that I've been doing dramatic
ones for a long time now and I'm also
going to show you a hair tutorial of
getting this really cool sort of curly
wavy ponytail as well I do use
extensions to achieve this ponytail so
stay tuned to the end to find out how I
do it in this and just a little
announcement if you do see this popping
up every now and then I'm currently
doing a huge giveaway on my Instagram
which is at Danny once we watch my vlog
channel video you're here to the full
explanation of the giveaway it's like
the biggest giveaway that I've done yet
and if you aren't Holly might Instagram
me the world to me if you would follow
it and enter for your chance to win so
back to the makeup look this is silvery
it's pink it's glittery it's pretty it's
soft its feminine so I really hope you
guys enjoy this look it's very different
from other books I've been doing
recently and let's jump into it so
beginning with the eyes today I'm going
to as always start with my Anastasio
beverly hills dipbrow this one is in the
shade dark brown i'm going to fill my
eyebrows mostly get focusing upon this
pot here which is a little bit's bear
I'm taking the Anastasio clear brow gel
I'm going to use this to set my brows
hello blurry camera I was going to put
this in my brow hairs to ensure they
will stay in place all day just realize
how many anastasi products I'm using I'm
using another Anastasi product this
palette is the shadow culture world
travel palette and because I want to
make this like a really pretty soft glam
kind of look I think the colors I'm
going to work with today will be stuff
like pink champagne spoiled intense kala
intensive gaze and maybe a little bit of
soft peach in Morocco I'm going to grab
this beautiful color called pink
champagne I'm going to pack this onto my
lid and we're going to see how that
looks because I have no idea how this is
going to turn out
I think I'm squeezed my finger and just
pack it on
I'm taking my Real Techniques don't
shadow brush think we're going to play
around with this one called intense gaze
and I'm going to aim to put it sort of
on my outer corner and bring it in a
little bit I'm going to pack it on the
side and sort of lift it a little bit
into my crease this is going to blend
out this crease part I'm going to try so
hard not to go overboard because I'm so
used to just doing like full-on makeup
tutorials then with a clean fluffy
blending brush we're just going to blend
this all together I'm going to pick up
pink champagne once again and sort of
add it back into my lid because we've
lost a lot of that color now picking up
this car here called soft pitch with a
blending brush once again I'm going to
place this underneath my eyebrow finish
it all up I'm going to grab Morocco
place this in my crease just just sort
of dark in me I look a little bit and
give it a bit more depth so I'm just
going to put this in my crease only
noting that this is looking quite pretty
now and I might leave it alone before I
destroy it just going to add a bit of
mascara I'm going to use the Too Faced
better than sex mascara as I always do
but I'm just firstly curling my lashes
and I am going to apply really natural
pretty false lashes afterwards for
lashes today I'm going to be using the I
spy lashes in elegant you can get these
from Danny Viacom they are my favorite
natural pretty eyelashes of all time
they are perfect for soft glam look so
as you can see these lashes literally
just look like they're my own eyelashes
bit longer now that our eyes done it's
time to apply some concealer I'm going
to use the Too Faced Born This Way
concealer this one is in the shade light
I'm sure but it's a little triangle
sections underneath my eyes this will
help to make us look awake and also
clean up any excess of falling of flesh
or anything
it's form from my eyes so I'm just using
a damp Beauty Blender and I'm going to
follow the line of my eye the way that
it goes naturally follow it upwards and
you can see you get like a really nice
little professional line from where you
did your eyeshadow as well now in order
to set everything together I'm using a
powder this is the NARS pressed powder
in Beach this is just going to ensure
that our face is a little bit more matte
not super shiny and that your skin
makeup will last all day no I have not
found a better press powder than the
NARS one I'm obsessed with it if you
guys know of any pressed path just
similar or just tell you what your
favorite press powder is in the comments
because I love to sort of branch out a
little bit and find anything for a
powder because I just feel like I use
this in every single tutorial well I
kind of do use it in every single short
but yeah thank you for me I'm absolutely
obsessed with this is my favorite
contour part right now I'm going to use
the shade medium maca off further what
I'm going to use the shape medium Walker
for my contour and then use this banana
shade underneath my eyes to set
everything together and I use the brush
it comes from Lisa brush it comes with
the palette because I find this brushes
awesome as well a light stroke like that
a little baby hairs I've got sideburns
guys what once we have a nice ugly line
it's time to blend it upwards now I'm
going to put a bit to my nose
wow that was a lot I stuffed up a
contour so bad oh my god please blend
out so easy Matt banana shade that I
spoke about before I'm going to release
this underneath my eyes next I'm going
to use this two-faced son bunny bronzer
it's a really really really pretty
bronzer and it's a great jib for me oh
my goodness what's it called Matt God
posit that's it it's a really good
substitute for that so I'm just going to
Pat it really bit on my cheeks
this is just to add a little bit more
definition to our face because I'm going
to use blush today and I never use blush
so I think I like to have a board with
the wrong things that I might look like
a bit of a clown you know Inari this is
really pretty a blush by a low rack this
is called prism it's super pretty
I'm just going to put a little bit on my
cheeks because this is like a pea you
know soft glam looks or one on a bit of
blush and now to finish off the skin
makeup I'm going to use the bomb
mary-lou manizer highlighter I'm going
to use it with this fan brush you guys
asked me all the time with this fan
brush is it's a 1 to 9 luxe and brush
the rolls called rolls for everyone by
zoeva rolls this lipstick is in the
shade crazy and love it's a beautiful
pink color and I'm sure pop this on my
lips I haven't actually used before so
I'm really excited to give it a go
I think this kind of work to do well
it's really pretty
go chichi I'm gonna take intense gaze
once again from the palette and I'm
going to run this underneath my eyes
because we don't really have any
definition under there at all yet it's
going to very lightly add that to the
one of the water lines then we take a
little bit of that pink champagne color
and add that to the first quarter of my
under-eye then with the it better than
sex mascara I'm just going to add this
to my little lashes so now that the
makeup is done I'm going to focus upon
my hair so I want to do today is
something very different much going to
tied up and I'm going to use extensions
and show you how I do a ponytail with
extensions and then we're going to curl
it as well as it's going to look really
cool and really different I'm going to
tie my hair into like a high ponytail
today so what I like to do personally is
keep a few front strands down I'm going
to take my hairbrush and brush all the
roots upwards and then I'm just going to
tie that spiit a lot as you can see this
is the length of my natural hair in the
ponytail because if I push my ponytail
to the front it just looks a bit like
and so I'm going to add these bad boys
these are my 24-inch foxy locks
extensions you guys saw me talk about
them in my June favorites I absolutely
adore them so what I'm going to do is
sort of clip them onto my ponytail and
give it the illusion that it's longer
it's so easy to do this from my easiest
extension hair routine of all time I'll
set up up around a little bit so I can
show you what we're going to do is make
sure obviously first that all your clips
are open in the extensions and I'm going
to put it behind my head like this and
I'm going to clip the first weft as
close to the hair tie as I possibly can
like that
so flick all your hair forward and then
carry on clipping the rest of the
extensions into your
so now you can see my hair looks
extremely long and extremely thick and
that was just from adding one left as
you can see you can see the extension
part up here so the way that we hide
that is that we grab a strand from the
extension let's see this big and you
actually use that hair to wrap it around
the hair tie parts that you actually
hide the extension webs as you can see
right now you just see the wrapped hair
you don't see the extension website
anymore so it's the easiest way to hide
it and I'm going to put the hair into
two parts and with a curling wand I'm
just going to wrap the hair around I've
got to wire my face nice
so as you can see we are left with this
sort of ombre curled ponytail bang going
on I think it's really cute it's really
fun and it's really pretty it matches
this loop really well as well so I hope
you guys enjoy this softer more natural
makeup look please let me know if you'd
like me to do more when the key checks
would be more than happy to you and I'll
see you all very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
