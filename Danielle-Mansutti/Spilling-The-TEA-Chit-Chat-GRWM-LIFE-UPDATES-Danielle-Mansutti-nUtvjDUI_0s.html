love's I have just done my tan washed my
hair so I'm currently sitting here with
like no bra on I'm trying to dry you
know how it is so I just felt like doing
a really casual get ready with me life
updates chit chat chit chat chit chat
video but I kind of have a few ideas
about stuff that I want to talk about
just update you guys on because I
haven't looked in a while and I feel
like this is kind of like a vlog the
purpose of this video isn't so much a
makeup tutorial it's just me getting
ready in chatting with you
I'm gonna start my eyebrows today I
think and also we have moved to my
bedroom if you have me on your Instagram
stories you would have seen that I
currently move my furniture around
because I'm crazy I don't know why I did
that but I decided to do that or sitting
in my bedroom getting it ready nice and
chilled so I'm just gonna use the
benefit to brow in number for my brows
today and I suppose once this is up you
guys would have already had Christmas so
I hope you have an amazing Christmas I
know this will be up on the weekend of
New Year's so my new easy to surely life
by now so make sure you click here to
see that I've had it really hot stroke
when I do my brows so just give me one
second okay that's done I've got some
brows on my face now I'm gonna have to
even this out with some foundation cuz I
look terrifying how good is a fresh
clean Beauty Blender like it's just it's
so for us and it's so clean it's just
like yes let's just priming I just want
to update you guys on everything because
although I look I'm very honest about
issues when it comes to mental health or
how I'm feeling I'm actually very
private about my private life and also
because I'm not vlogging very much these
days you guys don't really know a lot of
it what's been actually happening in my
life I suppose so I hope this video will
kind of some light into that and you can
kind of feel like you know what's going
on that makes sense I'm squeezed the
Urban Decay I'm reaching for the Animus
all night a foundation in 4.5
zoom whoosh smack that on the face I'm
so sad that I'm like running out of this
foundation or really need to go to talk
about
saying on Twitter an account of course
with an anonymous profile picture says
why do you never hang out with Tyler
anymore I've always put it there like a
few days ago um
I mean how I do hang out we just don't
snapchat every single time that we hang
out also things entirely is life right
now I'm just going so so so so well
she's got like so many things going on
and I'm so happy for I can't actually
say everything because it's her things
to tell but because she is super super
super busy these days we can only really
catch up maybe a few times a month and
that's like I completely understand why
because she's just literally so busy
I've been in that state before and I
know what it's like and it's really hard
but yeah we still hang out all the time
what this thing like nothing's changed
there at all we just don't really like
snapchat all the time I guess I don't
know I
Missha have no idea um I'm using a lip
primer now by the way I suppose you guys
also have like the zero idea speaking of
friendships and stuff in September I met
someone and we clicked so well and he's
not like anything to do with online
therefore you guys don't know about him
at all but he's now like one of my best
best friends absolutely adore him he's
so lovely and I've been spending like a
lot of my time recently like with him
and like his friends and stuff I think
with moving across the bar by yourself
like you just got to be open to more
things like me going on boys nights out
it's like it's cute that I get the
invite so I just go anyway but it is
always a bit strange to be in a new
place we don't have the support network
that you're used to so any opportunity
that I get to like hang out with new
people or whatever I'm just like I'm
there I find it like really fun actually
so he's meeting you people but then my
introverted batteries run out quite
quickly hidden like small doses it's
fine but nah so he's an absolute godsend
he's being so so so so good and yeah I
owe him he's a great person
you guys don't even know about me what's
so weird um and let me just do my
eyeshadow I'm gonna use the Too Faced
just peachy
mattes I'm going to see the Northern
Lights next year as you know it is like
the top of my bucket list and it's
actually happening next year I'm going
to be staying in Finland and I'm just
like over the moon I've also got like
this really really big actually too
massive massive projects happening next
year and they're both bigger than
anything that I've ever done before
so next year I'm gonna be spending a lot
of time on things outside of YouTube as
well in a sense but also spending a lot
more time doing like travel content I
really really really have like so many
really really really otherwise I have a
lot of ideas of like really cool travel
content to make next year and I kind of
feel like making it more so for a female
solo traveler or the female in group
travelers because I know that when I
went solo traveling I feel like every
single Travel Guide ever made ever is
from a man's perspective for men in a
sense and if you are a female so much
traveler and you're young where are
those guys it's just like they don't
understand there's some things as a
young woman you can't necessarily do
without feeling very unsafe if you are
by yourself in a foreign country so I
really would love to create content
which is like weekends away girl trips
like what to do hidden gems all that
kind of stuff let me know your thoughts
on that as well but definitely next year
is like a year of travel I've got I'm
going away in January I'm going away in
February ongoing March in February I'm
going to Australia January I can't tell
you yet March I can't really tell you
yet but like it's very exciting but I
feel like for me my passion in life like
what makes me tick what gets me going is
trouble and helping people with mental
health or just people with mental health
feeling better so they can talk about
things is like everything to me
right oh the multi palliative cool
this is aware of my Reds are hiding so
many is this also if you watch this for
the makeup store only I'm sorry but this
is gonna be the same a couple gotta do
the time it's more like an update
earlier but let me mix this and this
together let's see what we correct with
those two I've never ever ever ever ever
ever add an eyeshadow which is actually
red like red red I have got like
full-out gold all right now moist glue
some concealer I think when it comes to
moving in general like I've been in
England now June July August September
October November six months I've
officially been in for six months and I
honestly think it's the best thing that
I've ever done for myself like I know
that I am very I know that I am very
miserable on Twitter sometimes I know
that but it's more just the fact of like
it's nice to find a place where I can
chat you guys a lot feel like I don't
know I know I'm a bit of a miserable cow
bass it's hard moving it is hard and I
just think when I actually think about
like how I was in Melbourne I like how
things were going for me moving here was
the best decision and it's so hard to
explain but it's like I just feel like I
belong here like this feels like home to
me and it feels like when I go to visit
Australia like I still wish to love it
and I miss Australia but something about
England is just a home like it's just
where I belong and I just feel so
content that I finally found a place
that like I know that I'm supposed to be
if that makes any sense
so squeeze some born topoda to kind of
blend that together as well for some
reason I just seem to click and connect
with people in England easier
I always felt in a way unfortunately
this is just me and this
like a representation of what Australian
people like us around people are lovely
and there's so friendly and they're so
nice but me as a person for some reason
I just don't know why I found it very
hard to have that that click feeling
like when you just connect with someone
it could have just been the fact that I
wasn't around the right people obviously
because there would be someone or some
people in Australia that I would have
clicked with instantly obviously but
unfortunately I didn't really meet many
of those people in the ten years that I
was there it is so hard to explain that
feeling but like when you meet someone
you just get their humor and you just
bounce off of each other like I just
find that it happens so much more here
for me than it did back there and I
don't know which is because I am English
essentially like I'm not really
Australian the accent is very good
singing but I was raised here like I
lived here sits a little until I was
twelve when I came back to visit every
single year and it's just like I don't
know I was thinking about a litter
actually because when I moved to
Australia my mum was like my support
system she was my best friend because I
didn't have any friends and we moved
obviously I didn't know anyone so me and
my mum became very close and my mum is
very very very English taught my life
like just with her influence I think it
kind of stuck around as well and I kind
of fit here in the US because I ended up
moving back here and she was like no
because she loves Australia now and she
would never move back yeah so it's tough
times I'm just gonna go and set my face
with this mark powder and quicker before
I do that I'll check what else you guys
saying oh the paranormal situation ah do
you guys remember when I had a ghost a
little shadow man pulling me around my
last flat honestly since I've moved it's
completely gone like it was whatever it
was was in that flat and it just it's
weird because you can't explain these
things like that when you feel the
presence you feel it like you just you
know and I sound like an absolute crazy
person when I talk about it so I don't
really talk about it that much I thought
I was gonna die in that house there was
just something so creepy about it I'm so
glad that I escaped when I did actually
when I first moved here I experienced it
once and that was like two months ago
and then
and then it's just completely gone so
I'm like oh I can breathe again I can
sleep again it's nice this is a good
question how do you get out of that
yucky rut when you can't stop looking at
girls and Instagram it make you feel
self-conscious because I always get
started that me too is so draining and
such a waste of time but I honestly
think we all do it and it is just so bad
for me the other day I woke up I got an
email which had pretty bad news in it
and I was just like in a bad mood anyway
and then I went on Instagram and then I
went on like slow page which is just a
disaster waiting to happen I don't know
why I go on that that is literally where
like all my issues come from is that god
damn it's full page I was looking
through it and I came across someone who
is in the same industry as me and
everything and I was looking at their
content and they just seemed to have it
all together like you know perfect
friends relationships everything in
life's going so well for them they're
growing so fast and getting so many
likes and this and that an amazing body
and blah blah blah blah honest to god
I spent an hour in bed looking through
all of their posts and making myself
feel bad about myself I didn't have the
same views in the same following info
but look I need to really drive myself
insane and I tweeted about that of
course I did because I tweet about
everything and it was actually you guys
that kind of helped me change my
perspective and get out of that stupid
funk because it is such a waste of
energy and I swear to you it took like
half the day until I just dropped it and
felt better at myself but then I thought
about it and it's so weird because I was
feel like that from someone who's in my
industry yet if anyone who doesn't know
me went on my Instagram page and they
see this like portrayal of like
happy-go-lucky the edited existence of
my life and my highlight reel
essentially is always screaming
they could feel the same way and I was
actually thinking hold on him and I'm
like in bed miserable like getting
myself so down about not being like
another person yeah there could be
someone out there looking at my stuff
feeling the same way but not realizing
I'm not bouncing off the walls with
happiness and like my life isn't as put
together is I may make it seem at times
and I thought this is really weird I had
a lot of people say they all that's my
feeling on your page and I was like look
why I like my life isn't like this or
like that desert it but then I thought
hot on with it they're comparing
themself or something it's not real like
I'm not saying my instagrams not real
I'm just saying it's like it's not
accurate second a second representation
of my day in my life it's what I choose
to show it's what who I choose to be and
want to portray to the world but it is
still me obviously it's me it can't be
anyone else but being in the industry
myself you to think that I wouldn't
compare myself to others because I know
the ins and outs of it
but at the same time I'm like hold on
nothing is what it seems an Instagram
like literally nothing and all I did was
turn off my phone do the few things that
I enjoy and then within a few hours over
it honestly though I think if you're
gonna really about the state when it
comes to comparisons the best thing you
can do is to turn your phone off stop
looking at it
100% it is the issue you're fine and I
know how addicting it is I know once you
go on Instagram and you've gone through
all your food and then you start looking
at the explore page because you're bored
and what else can you see and you dig
and you dig and you dig and you come
across this girl and that girl on this
body and that body and then you just
stuck in the hole again I know and as
women we always compare ourselves to
other people always but we're all on
different parts and life we're all at
different stages and different chapters
so comparing is honestly nothing but a
waste of time it's not even motivation
it's just it is just pointless
I don't really practice what I
sometimes I fall into the pit of
comparison weekly like every two days or
so I'm just like hmm why can't I have
that she's so amazing I'm such a failure
blah blah blah it's like what am i
gaining from this absolutely nothing I'd
love to know how your mental health is
thank you that's a lovely question by
the way I'm using the Milani run so if
you're running which one it's so pretty
isn't it
my mental health is a love it I'm
currently PMS iam appearance you like
tomorrow so any mood that I have right
now I'm just like ignore it it doesn't
matter
how's the mental health honestly it's
not it's not bad okay it's not bad and
I'm very thankful for that I have my
moments I have my phases and depression
is something that doesn't just go away
sometimes you wake up when you just wish
you didn't
depression sucks it does it sucks and
it's hard like when you have your really
really crap days you are having any crap
day like there's nothing to get you out
of it um in terms of anxiety anxiety is
like this year thank God has been really
under control for me I got therapy about
a year and a half ago in Australia and
she only focus on my anxiety not my
depression I was kind of like this
depression is my issue and she was like
you don't realize anxiety is your issue
I was like okay so she really dug deep
into that found my triggers and it made
me feel a million times better once I
acknowledged where these thoughts and
feelings and stuff coming from I was
like oh no it makes sense but I'm like
I'm making so much progress
honestly like I just keep telling myself
to stop being so self-deprecating as
well but I'm making progress and making
friends I'm putting myself out there
I've done so many things I never thought
I'd be able to do at 23 so it's all good
it's all good
next question so oh my goodness guys
next year I wish I could tell you what's
happening next year and actually 2019
happening like that and also as you know
I now upload on Sundays at 7:30 p.m. in
the UK which is 6:30 a.m. in Australia
and out late on Sundays because after a
little while of doing Tuesday or Friday
I kind of looked at my content and I
thought is it quality or is it quantity
some time do you know like I would try
and rush a video for choose don't to
make sure I had something but I thought
do people really want to see that I have
no idea
I forgot we re-evaluated that's what at
everything that I was doing and I saw
hold on a second
if I do one I'll go to wait but I make
it really good not really is that better
for me but it's better for everyone else
and they kind of am more excited to wait
for a certain day of me uploading
instead of seeing like feel like content
or anything so that's why I've decided
to do Sundays for next year I'm gonna
use the Oprah Bali highlight you can
always get a 30% off over by using my
cupboard Danni 30 and I'm gonna put that
on sorry if you can't see the other side
of my face by the way I'm like looking
in the mirror but he's been sighs I
don't know gonna corners
done highlight zone and this is still my
ultimate favorite lipstick it's the Y
cell number seven because that stick is
incredible it changed my life it doesn't
come off I love it and it doesn't dry it
you loose it feels like you're right
nothing at all nothing at all I'm gonna
go ahead and get what I'm gonna get
every what I'm gonna go ahead and give
everything as spirits why did I forget
how to speak English that was a really
weird okay Oh noise noise let's take off
that headband oh my god the front of my
hair is gone really weird what because
