today's video we are doing a Q&amp;amp;A I
actually guys to send me some questions
through Twitter I'm just going to go
straight ahead and get right into it
today the first question is when did you
get boobs I am assuming you are a fact
but I put Instagram the other day um
well that was a great little push-up bra
that I bought from Kmart like I swear to
God I bought it from Kmart it is the
best push-up bra ever and it may even
work I had boobs so good I actually
seriously saw a ton of questions on that
photo being like did you get a baby oh
my god but nope never had surgery just a
really good push-up bra do you get
sponsored a lot the way I work when it
comes to sponsorships and stuff like
that it might be a little bit different
to other youtubers so I'd say within
every 10 the sponsorship emails that
come my way I would probably take either
zero or one so I only use products that
I use myself that I believe in that I
passionate about because there's no
point me being like oh my god this
foundations best foundation ever and the
next week thing like no way this
foundation is the best foundation of it
you know what I mean because and you're
like how can I trust you like which one
is the best kind of thing and I feel
like for you guys it's so obvious when
you watch your youtuber and they're not
passionate about something and you're
like okay it has to be organic it has to
be like true to myself and what I
believe in I mean I get some crazy
sponsorships on my way and just like
that's a lot of money but it's not
really for me that's why I won't though
because I'm not in YouTube for the money
or anything I mean YouTube like the
creativity and stuff like that sorry I'm
stupid lucky to get sponsorships when I
do but I do not take all them because
yeah I don't want to be a sellout
basically if you could be on any reality
TV series what would you want to be on
and why I would starve your go box
I love go box
very much and we don't know what it is
it is literally a TV show of you
watching other people watching TV
does that sound kind of weird because
it's the best show ever I'm pretty sure
goggle walk started in the UK and they
brought it over to Australia and I loved
it so much it was the most hilarious
programming my family loved it just so
much and I would love to be on goggle
box
funny fact when I was in the park
yesterday I saw a woman bubble box and I
got to see a person hide away yeah I was
just like mom look look she's from
called the box when she's are you gonna
say hi and I was like oh so now I know
how scary it is for you guys when you
come to how to make sounds like oh is
Danny Beauty Store going to be expanding
like brushes and makeup that many saw is
expanding on cheese day I can tell you
guys John this is really fun okay see
this right here this is gonna be a DVD
so I've had this bargain Apicella
and I love you I've seen it in like
really old snapchats of my dad I said
back a smile when I was like wrap it up
so yeah let me grab the other two
quickly show you as well so I designed
these cases a little while ago this one
says I love you and it has sort
of like a watercolor dip dye on the
pattern of the and I absolutely love it
the color is beautiful the front of its
like this it goes all the way around and
it's beautiful and there's also like
little holes and all that kind of stuff
for your buttons and whatnot so the
other one is on the definition of my
life this one is a black point case and
it says if it a black put it back on the
rack so these phone covers are for
iPhone 6 and 6s the big size in the loo
size 6 if you don't know man for the
last one is this adorable one which says
prob it looks really weird my camera for
some reason but it is like stripy it is
so cute so cute so I drew the little pug
and everything these three phone cases
are gonna be live on Danny Beauty Store
on Tuesday yeah we have very limited
stock ibiza after these go we are not
getting new stock so there's a limited
edition you have to get them
again while I'm at it the phone cases
are like super bendy and all that kind
of stuff is super durable super high
quality biggest a thing that's change
that you've been single and what have
you learned from your relationship
breakup biggest thing has changed my
freedom I guess me and Michael we're
still friends
but positive still friends I have no
nothing bad to ever say by Michael ever
and I never will on this channel
personal experience ever since being
single and everything I just felt like
I've had way more freedom because you
know do what you want all the time
without worry about anything really nice
as well to not be stressing out about
like what your partner's doing what
still has Chad stay hydrated
what is this mood I'm in today like hey
I just feel like I focus so much more my
social life that's being single I've met
so many cool people and you people and
made so many new friends and I go out a
lot more than I used to and stuff like
that so that's really fun
yes it's taken a while to get used to
I'm very used to being single now I'm
very used to just the single life I
guess and it's fine like there's nothing
wrong with being single at all it's like
fine what is one thing you would like to
do before you die I want to skydive so
bad I would love to screw it up at some
point this year a lot of cars everywhere
I've wanted to do it ever and my mom's
something I really want to do it looks
amazing and if any of you skydived if
you have please leave your experience
down below I would love to hear it
because it's definitely something that I
want to do what do you dip your chicken
nuggets in damn my to ketchup or as we
say in Australia tomato sauce is to want
to catch up and tomato sauce the same
thing because why are they called
different things it just the whole like
crisps chips argument lollies candy
sweets argument whatever we all have
different words for it but in Australia
they don't say tomato ketchup they said
tomato sauce that was something I
learned when I came he excels like do
you guys have any ketchup for the
Nuggets they were like what - all three
luck question is how do you describe the
feeling you get when you see girls all
over the world wearing and adoring the
luscious you design oh and this is a
serious question I love it so much if
you're following me on snapchat you may
be seen when out to the group and that
the movie festival I actually bumped
into a whole group of girls and they
were all wearing wear lashes and I went
around I recognized each one pair were
wearing like you're wearing flip you are
in Maura
it was amazing it's a kind of scrap it's
like the best feeling in the world when
I see other people wearing them and when
you guys share yourselves wearing them
on social media and on Instagram and tag
the eyes my lashes because I know how
they look on me but it's so interesting
to see how they look on you because they
are so flattering on so many different
shapes and all that kind of stuff today
I'm wearing ice by lucious I roamed the
Admira style and I like to sort of
switch up I have my own favorites
obviously within the range because
that's what suits my eyes but I know
stuff like famous in midnight and
smitten and stuff like that they suit
others shape eyes as well they look
amazing on other people so don't it if
you have ever wore my eyelashes please
share a photo or something you were in
them because it means the world to me
and I always go through the ice by
lashes hashtag every single day and
check it every single day so
I will definitely see it if you post it
definitely give you some like my little
baby it's just amazing I love it and fun
fact Oh secret confidential fact lots of
confidential stuff in this Q&amp;amp;A this
packaging is going out soon so I have a
new shipment of stock all the way with
brand new packaging how it should be so
exciting and that concludes my Q&amp;amp;A for
today I hope you guys enjoyed it and I
will see you all very soon yeah bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
