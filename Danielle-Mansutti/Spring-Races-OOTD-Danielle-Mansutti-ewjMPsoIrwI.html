this video is super exciting I'm working
with a slice to take a fashion punt this
spring races season oh I love spring
races fashion it is so nice but
sometimes it can be so predictable right
a lot of time when I go to the races
it's the same dresses the same color is
the same designs and it's like this is a
little bit encouraging you guys take a
little bit of a risk with your water
choice this races season and take a
little bit of a fashion style pants so
I've chose something which is a bit more
unpredictable something different and
something very unique that I wouldn't
really see normally at the races I chose
such a gorgeous mint color dress as you
guys know I love my black if it ain't
black put it back on the Ratigan but
because of this campaign actually love
the idea of going out of your comfort
zone a little bit and finding something
different to wear this spring racing
season everything I'm wearing the dress
the shoes bag and the fascinator are all
from ASOS and I will leave all their
links in the description below so I have
filmed an outfit of the day but before I
jump into that I'll also let you know on
the a sauce at they have this really
really cool stuff on his game or used to
do is take a style and find your spirit
animal aka the racers and you can win a
trip to London and heap surprises I want
to show you guys how I style myself on
ASOS for the spring races and I really
hope you guys enjoy this outfit of the
day style video and let's jump straight
into it
so I really hope that you guys enjoy the
outfit of the day stealthier I've never
done an outfit of the day only star
video and it was so much fun to film so
please let me know your thoughts on what
I chose to wear for the spring races and
I'll talk to you guys really soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
