video because we are we testing out a
bunch of primarch makeup and I am so
excited about she never watched another
YouTube view on this I didn't spoil
anything for me but I went to Primark
and I picked up so much stuff I could
not believe how much stuff that she had
on offer there and I'm very excited to
get started today so literally
everything I'm using is like one pound
two pounds and I'm using at the brushes
as well so I got these brushes from
Primark and they all make sure they're
like incredible like I'm in similar
stuff so I'm very excited to try out the
makeup I also got a Beauty Blender and
it comes with like this little egg stand
this isn't she the cutest thing I've
seen in my life in terms of our
foundation choices I have two they're
slightly different colors I didn't like
color much myself when I was there so I
picked up a long way ultimate matte
foundation this one was five pounds and
it is in the shade toffee this one was 2
pounds 50 it's in the shade light beige
I have a feeling this would be more to
mine it'll be more my color than this
how about we start by popping it on my
chin I'm going to start with this brush
which actually has like a sponge on the
end which is so cool I'm going on
so it looks like we're gonna be using in
this guy this one I think might be too
dark me look at my hands like no would
you don't back down my hands but that is
quite a difference we're gonna use the
best coy those a bit more on oh my god
that came out like much of it I'm gonna
try and use this sponge now it's not
drying like I wet it but like it's just
still really damn so might give that a
little moment and then we do it with my
concealer but I'm just gonna go and buff
this into my skin you really like the
color oh and also with it my filming set
up right now please ignore the
background but basically I arrived back
from the Maldives a day ago and then I
go to Australia like tonight so I've had
no time to film some bit before it
was a boyfriend's house while he's at
work this is the only time I could
possibly film this so I'm sorry that I'm
just like sitting in his kitchen do what
you gotta do alright we have the
foundation on and my god that is a
hundred and fifty million percent worth
- bouncing - what Oh
so my camera had like a softening filter
on it it just does its what the Sony
cameras do so my skin might look a bit
softer than it does in person but you
can see regardless of that it's like
covered really well I actually do have
quite a lot of like not completely
covered like my breakouts or anything I
am actually super like happy and
impressed with this foundation it was
like what you're getting for the price
like it's an easily really interesting
to see how this might work throughout
the day as well so we're going to do
some concealer this one is a sticky note
I've not using it so long I'm never used
to concealers in shade ivory and I
believe this was about one pound this is
a nother brush it's like a jewel ended
one I'm just gonna use this side blend
him in I mean the brushes themselves too
are about two pounds but I will actually
leave in the description what I'm using
and how much it is exactly sure don't
give you any wrong information
I don't think there's anything that's
really over like four or five pounds
that I'm using so it's all really good
like really really affordable I am gonna
grab this mineral powder which is in the
shape beige and it will do them and I'm
that's it oh that would be a really good
start
I'm just gonna be using of this guy to
set my concealer let me take off this
trying so hard not to get in make it up
anywhere like this alright so let's try
putting a bit of powder on Beauty
Blender this kit so go either way this
is not gonna work it hurts a little so
wet so I think I'll just take the brush
ways before instead except Beauty
Blender it's not complying I'm just
gonna put that powder my undereyes it's
kind of evened it out a little bit more
but definitely some reason looks way
more red toned and I would have thought
maybe yellow
oh she's yellow right like fish it's
fine
so let's attack the browser we're naked
without them so um let's start with this
is the iconic brow I can't think it says
electronic growl no whining
well what would an electronic growl help
me I don't even understand so iconic
brow I could actually see any shade name
do anything that all just seems to be
the same color
sounds gonna grab a bit and put it on
this brush which is also from Primark
gonna be a little hard to do far away so
that's trying oh my god this is so good
what on earth I get this shade is
perfect it is gliding on so breast
literally I am so impressed with this
I'm really confused this has to be some
kind of joke I was not expecting this in
life
be like dragging along whatever you
literally could see it's like gliding on
and this brush is really good as well
I'm in a bit of shock here right now
because I prefer high marks I rap homage
to an accessibility hills dipbrow but
it's happening literally by John for the
price of the quality this is the easiest
Tanner will ever give like that is
insanely good
speechless literally finish this now I'm
gonna take this brow gel just just set
my brows this was about a pound I
believe as well so we use this to make
sure everything stays in place I'm gonna
take this wrong for the load now it
doesn't look very dark no I see help me
go with it I'll try it on my cheeks but
like I said it just doesn't lock to me I
open it that would be fantastic I will
use this brush I mean how cool are these
like little unicorn mermaid brushes this
stick so see
mmm in all honesty I'm baffled and
amazed by the outcome that we're having
I was not expecting this in the
slightest I haven't watched any other
videos regarding this and I'm just like
how is this possible I don't understand
if I wasn't like high school back in the
days of like the dream that moves and
all that this is so good like a high
school makeup because it is so cheap and
it is actually really good
cool I'm now it's gonna put a little bit
on the sides of my nose this is a
highlight powder see how we go I think
I'm a fan brush I did I got a little fan
brush from my micro Sol which is very
cute hello you definitely have to use a
lot for it to come up at all well I mean
that's not bad is it my mark I see you
like I see you Mitchell he's so excited
about this I just was not expecting that
I'm so excited like the eye portion now
cuz that's gonna be like so interesting
for me because as we know eyes are
always my favorite part now I wonder
what brand gave the inspirations for
that chocolate eyeshadow palette as soon
as I saw this I was like Hello it's same
with this which I did not shown up using
the chocolate cheek palette actually
having it in love heart and the font and
like milk chocolate I was like very very
close to two things there so I don't
actually have many eye brushes I
couldn't see too many my Primark so I'm
gonna have to use this really quite big
fluffy brush and I'm just gonna start
with the lighter shade and then go into
the darker one I'll just pigmented and I
have a big brush and it's really fun to
blend we can do it guys I believe in us
we can do it do what do what do it now
mmm this song isn't a perfect oh you
know I just realized it smells like
chocolate
now I actually picked up some pigments
which I thought was sick there we've got
like a gold rose garden I like gold what
was that oh my god next wave mirror just
like crap Oh the shutter benefi alright
pigment time this is gonna be messy I'm
gonna be really careful you've got to be
kidding me literally look I can't
believe this is happening I actually oh
my lord
now I'm gonna take this one which is a
little bit lighter and that's just like
dab a little bit on the inner corner I'm
seasoning that I should have it for
really lightly noise so now I am going
to curl my lashes with the lash curler
that I got from there as well so I love
don't mind changing scenery
I'm just hitting that psychically
because I think it's easier for me to
see with of light how it actually that
door is about slamming like three and
two this will just show a bit clearer
how it all looks nice to mascara and
lips and then we are door I now occur on
because I don't get ammonia and England
is
so I hope this which is called the false
lash effect feel like everyone can see
me right now my guys just nice all right
let me do yeah it's nice I let you have
nothing to complain about this whole
video like very surprised and very like
wow lips nice the thing gonna line it
with this one in
what's your name desert sand
the lipstick we're using this
instability the liquid lipstick very
nude it's two pounds like so much
lighter than some guys I'm really
confused how is it as good I genuinely
am like confused I don't understand
good I'm genuinely I've never felt like
this and something like a review or
whatever because I think I had such a
different expectation seriously they
know what they're doing at Primark do
you mean not even close to my big old
face you can suit yourself
so I'm gonna run inside in a sec so I
don't get like sitting here like this is
so good I would keep this so that in
terms of its value to money quality
everything nine point five out of ten I
have some like sunken smile lines I can
see going and I don't know how it would
last like over time but nine point five
out of ten
speechless this is amazing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
