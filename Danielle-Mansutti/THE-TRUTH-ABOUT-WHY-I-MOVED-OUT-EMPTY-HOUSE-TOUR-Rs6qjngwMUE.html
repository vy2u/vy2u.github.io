channel so I go down home I'm reliving
my parents house I think about that I
don't know what to buy washing or feed
me every night but that's okay because
I'm gonna get my own space I absolutely
love it I have been asked many questions
from you guys about what's going on what
happens the last place that I lived in
that original grant now so I'm now
living in a high-rise apartment in the
city and I'm absolutely loving it so far
this has been my dream for so long and
I'm finally in a really beautiful little
apartment so I'm so happy about it so
I'm toes of my fielding space I don't
really know but of course I had to put
up very much because hello beauty guru
very LEDs I am renting Haidari I don't
own this apartment my god I wish I could
I can't afford to do that sir I'm
renting this apartment for the next year
so the first question is from Tara Graf
who asks what happened to your other
place you moved into so if you have been
following long enough in November 2015 I
moved out of home and into a little
house unit and the locations far away
like it was just in the middle of
nowhere but I went there because it's
into my house and my ex-boyfriends house
maybe a bit of time right bang in the
middle buy houses so I felt like it was
so much easier to see him because of the
direction I thought my life was going at
at that point we were talking about like
getting an apartment together or moving
in together I was like oh you know you
can come to this house and the plan was
sort of like being flip there sorry fast
forward to December's I've been living
there for about a month one of my
friends said that she really needed a
place to stay I should know it ago and
she couldn't stay with her boyfriend or
anything so I offered her to come and
live with me soon phone when she was
living there absolutely loved living
with her so much but then after about 2
or 3 weeks her boyfriend was like I do
have an extra Murphy now so she went and
she lived with her boyfriend who she
still lives with now and then when she
left I was like still living in the
houses like oh and then I was at the
house and my four
with a boyfriend and I was no single and
I was like I don't know about it so
obviously mom and dad were like are you
sure you really won't be living alone
right now like you've just come out of
like a four-year relationship and you're
home by yourself and your depression is
really bad I don't really think you
should be living there right now I'm
like you know what that makes a lot of
sense so I moved back home with my
parents because it was a really low
point in my life obviously after like a
massive breakup like that but I thought
it was like temporarily I was going to
move out from there and back into my
parents house but I ended up staying my
parents house and yeah that's kind of
like the reason of why it happened I
didn't want to go back to that house to
kind of get any bad memories because of
where it was it was like we literally
like so close to my eggs and it was just
like not right for me anymore now there
is another reason as to why I thought
very uncomfortable living at that house
totally a nice story it was horrible I
was really uncomfortable living at that
house thanks to those trolling websites
for y'all known love basically I loaded
an empty house two up itself so excited
obviously it's my first place at home I
really wanted to share with you all and
I wanted to share my moving out process
everything which he may have noticed is
quite absurd this time around this is
wide in about a few hours the trolls on
you know they searched so hard on
renting websites and like you know
housing websites and everything to find
my place and within a few hours because
I shared what my kitchen look like they
dug and dug and dug and dug and dug and
when they finally found my address and
they found how much rent I was playing
awake and everything they found
everything because they were just
digging for information and
they say they hate me but they spend all
the time which all the time researching
me okay but anyway they posted my
address in the public forum and I don't
live there for like a week or two weeks
and that was terrifying the fat bit
people they knew exactly where I lived
and it wasn't like a big apartment block
of security it was a house like anyone
could have gotten there and I was around
of time to shine everyone's house got
broken into and I was just freaking out
I was just so heartbroken because I've
been waiting so long to move into that
and it was such an exciting thing for me
and within about a week or two weeks it
was completely ruined for me I had to
make an account on that website and like
jump onto it and find a moderator to get
them to remove that host of my address
because it is actually against the rules
you're not allowed to post you should
address on and these hate forums but
they did and the moderator actually did
take it down thank God but obviously
people still knew where I lived I was
literally scared of going there because
people knew what my address points so
that is why I am being very careful in
this place and it absolutely breaks my
heart because all I want to do is show
you I want to do an apartment tour this
sucks cuz I really have to like to be
thinking it's better to be safe than
sorry I don't want people posting my
addresses on hate forums and stuff
because why I just posted on hate forums
people that hate me like exchanging my
address you can imagine how scared I was
every time I heard a noise or anything
like I was losing because people are
gonna cover like try and kill me or
something it was just really horrible
and it made me feel uncomfortable and I
totally do not agree that I think it is
so not okay and that should not be
allowed and it isn't allowed on their
forum so anyway that is a huge reason as
to why I didn't live there anymore
because I was very uncomfortable about
living there on my own at my new place
like I said I could be super careful
about showing where I live and it sucks
it really sucks I wish I could show you
but I can't so and it sucks because 99%
of you just want to see it and my you
know enjoy it everything in
is such a small amount of people
actually want to like seek out my
address and like use it against me and
stuff like that so it's like but because
I don't live at the other place anymore
I can show you my empty house tour from
my own house finally I had to put up
private unfortunately like much few
hours after I posted such a bummer but
you'll see me about six or seven months
ago showing you at a house tour are we
going to jump over to my old house tour
this is not my current apartment it's
like a house tour he is my old auntie
house tour back to my channel today is
so exciting because I'm in my new house
are we doing an empty house to a few
guys and just showing you around or
let's tell them if you guys really like
it and let's jump straight into the
empty house tour now we're standing at
the front door I have my stairs just
here and then we have these like wooden
floors I don't have a washing machine
yet I've got to be such an adult and
actually install the washing machine hey
this will be my pantry where I'll keep
all my food and then we have this big
space just like my living area so we've
come in from the front door over here
and now we are on our way to the kitchen
part the kitchen let me just go all the
way back I'll show you guys so the
kitchen I've got a dishwasher and oven
already installed I have to get a
microwave there's so many cupboards so
many I only eat tuna so today I'm going
to feel that I'm aiming to have like my
TV here my couch here my dining table
around here and then over in this corner
I want to have my desk so I'm going to
be editing and uploading when I do
get internet because if you do follow my
blogs you know that I've been having a
lot of issues with Telstra and my
internet so yeah I love the fact that
the rooms upstairs it's really English
too reminds me of all the houses in
England having been living downstairs
and the bedrooms upstairs it smells like
new carpet best smell ever so this is
the first room here this is going to be
a spare room and there's some water I've
said up there as well
it's a really good size as well really
good size in there this is going to be
where the magic happens this is going to
be my filming room our only problem is
that has a big ugly wardrobe which I'm
gonna have to hide somehow this is my
ensuite in here so cool like this is the
first time I've ever had my own bathroom
cuz I've always shared it with my
brother so having my own ensuite and two
other toilets is pretty cool pretty cool
there is gonna be wet shower and then
where I brush my teeth and where I do
lots of we finally in here we have my
wardrobe
the next question is is Coco going to
live with you the story with Coco is
that she's still gonna be my family
parents house and looking stuff because
I personally feel that this apartment is
way too small for a Labrador it's a
high-rise and I just feel she would get
very depressed
it sucks to me because I'd be so much
happier if she was here but I know she
so much happy at my parents house when
she's getting a lot of attention and
she's able to walk outside because she's
a big dog and if in a confined apartment
I kind of think it's a bit mean
especially for the kind of dog that she
is because she needs to be played with
all the time what kind of stuff but I
don't really have the space to do that
with her here it's a high-rise which is
very awkward together to go to the
toilet what kind of stuff so
unfortunately she's not living with me
but I will be seeing every single week
always and just like going home to
Walker because I'm obsessed with her we
all know that what made you decide to
move to the city I've always wanted to
live in the city because I feel I am 21
years old I'm single I have nothing
holding me down this is pretty much the
only time I
I really feel like I'm going to thrive
of living in the city alone and I just
feel like this is the time of my life
where I want to be really independent
and sort of learn how to do that I think
being frightened of the city is so good
for that will you do more meetups in
Melbourne I would love to come and to
meet you now that I live in the city I
would love to if you guys don't mind I
might just snapchat at lunchtime be like
I'm gonna go to a park and we can all
have a picnic if you want to come the
next two minutes does that sound good
because I'm so getting to do so like
that so as I say a message thank you for
watching today it means the world to me
and I hope you are excited that we can
do a lot more Melbourne meetups
anyway guys I'll see you all very soon I
love you all so much and hope you have a
great day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
