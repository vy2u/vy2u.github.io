really like oh yeah kinda like popcorn
is Malcolm you know that rehab center in
why would we have fun here what's I mean
whatever yeah I melt back just finishing
a lala land any movie like that that
provides the kind of escapism I forget
who I am and I'm so immersed in the
movie and the art and just like whoo it
was amazing really good I mean I have
really high expectations because you
know everyone's gonna learn about it but
I'm such a film nerd and the
cinematography was just incredible
so much was filmed in like one take it's
just unbelievable and then I was like
all sad and salty in the middle of it
I'm like I don't have anyone that loved
me like and I get back here and I'm like
okay strong independent woman how can I
be sad though I mean look at this room
look at this place and I haven't
actually checked out the view at
nighttime yet look at that
what beautiful place seriously so we do
that it's so lovely to connect with
Talia as well like I've wanted to meet
you for a long time a great day and I'm
so excited a little benefit finalist to
come see so I'm learning to sunny
California came raining all night just a
way to see not used Aranea
I keep getting this was people my dear
fellow guys last night
oh no I slept about an hour and a half
and I am so tired I don't have the
energy to go to gym or anything like I'm
just that's a choice and the way back ok
lipstick is change really low to a red
lip it's like a luncheon and hello yes
last night I'm when I read the sequel in
my head just call so yes ok last night
Holly sat at all I have the benefit
luncheon now which I'm super excited for
but
they also died no oh my god this webinar
come on LI we might be having like a
pool lunch kind of party buff oh well
I'm sure we'll be amazing regardless of
the weather and I'm so excited to meet
the benefit team properly I've only met
the Australian medical teams would be
great to meet all the US benefit team as
well and like that is that this is I can
play nice as long as I win darling who
I'm suggestive
so you are seductive or you know that's
what your brows say about you little bit
about what we're doing here to that in
LA this the market promises is a mystery
in the concealer to three or four tisane
UI litters Paula's murder a lot of
things you look for the most hours based
on your eyes that secret hidden I
designed well and athlete and now we
have everyone Photoshop this problem the
actor has ultimate you stop all this
ha ha people invest on your Idol really
play we can actually want everything yes
I'm about to go hi guys I'm back in my
room now the event was absolutely
beautiful I really loved being when they
put like all the little details and
little final touches in the design the
whole place it was so beautiful
regardless of this weather they pulled
it off so well as many of you know I do
travel by myself a lot sometimes I just
have to sort of grin and bear the fact
that I'm don't have like a safety net or
a friend to talk to
so that's why when you're in these kind
of situations you have to make the most
of it you have to put yourself out there
you have to sit with people and you have
to ask people questions about themselves
start conversation and all that kind of
stuff so now I have a few hours before
it's really big party tonight I think
the best thing for me to do is to get
some room service watch some total divas
and then how to news and then to run a
couple over again before tonight I just
want to say a huge massive thank you to
benefit for inviting me see that today
it was so beautiful and I have so many
goodies

for the HP party tonight

dress I want to actually look a girl

momentum to a gym I really don't feel
like going at all and I want to be
something hydrated like I've not been
drinking like any water here not swirly
live just lovely motivation but I'm
going to go it's better than not going

that I miss about traveling is being
able to make my own protein shake break
