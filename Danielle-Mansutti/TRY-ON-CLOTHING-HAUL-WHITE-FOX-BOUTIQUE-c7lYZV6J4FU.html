join downstairs because I had a delivery
check this out I have four white box
boutique parcels I'm so excited to open
em I'm going to try all of these on
camera key right now because I'm just so
excited
like I totally excited about it I do
have a close white box we check the code
is Danny and it gets you 15% off so
excited and let's try them on and here
we have outfit number one which I am
absolutely in love with I've wanted to
like just so long and it's just so
beautiful so as you can see it has
jumpsuit with legs which I love and it's
so like fitted at the waist is really
nice Xplosive well it's incredibly
comfortable I would love to wear this to
like a night out with some nice heels or
something I think this is absolutely
beautiful
the next play suit that I picked is
absolutely gorgeous kaki play suit and
it's a little tight around the front as
well and it's quite a low cottage place
so do you want many nipple colors all
the little things like that you can put
things you could give yourself
my boobs so small and I don't need that
yay the color is unlike anything else
that I have to become the owner and this
in black start I thought I'd go a little
bit outside the box and pick cocky and I
really really like spicy I really love
the sleeves as well I like how this is
really insane with the shorts I think
it's really cute it's really pretty I'm
definitely going to wear this one on
lights out yeah okay now this is such a
beautiful effortless play suit so it
does have short the flap does have that
appearance of a dress so this is just
like the perfect flip on kind of play
suit which I really love
it is so comfortable and so nice and
tight and fitted in the way which is
always a bonus and I'm pretty sure I'm
pretty sure this is very small the
majority of the clothes I have a small
except the
the pants are a medium and the back of
the closet is quite low cut as well but
it's a really nice material really
fitted and really really flattering I'm
seriously obsessed with this outfit I
love being short I think they are so
beautiful love the length on autumn I
thought to like through shorts
so these are perfect and then this top
which I am going to wear so awesome
stuff to me itself I love it this
compromise is like a starry night or
something like it's just so cool and so
different I like how it's Easter I've
just matched it with like a bralette
underneath oh my god I love this outfit
it's such like a festive laughter
reducer cool so here are the shorts up
close from behind it was like this I'm
loving these Asher nice I will wear a
belt with this is to make sure that it's
nice and I'm all sucked in and
everything like that and this top is
seriously looks nice I love it so I'd
actually choose that many crop tops so I
will quickly put on the next pants that
I have with this top as well but I'm
loving this how much anomie top is this
job I love it so much
so I'm going to quickly change my pants
and I'll be right back okay
oh my goodness look at how gorgeous
these pants are I don't own anything
like them and they are so nice I love
how it looks like I'm wearing Bombur
you know what I mean all whoo gorgeous
and I really like how on the side they
actually have this thinking like fully
this is hope into the pants or is a good
bonus oh my god these are so lovely I
really like them and the feeling I like
suede who feels gorgeous these are the
next shot which fits like an absolute
love seriously they fit so well I like
these a lot
I like how they have pockets pockets are
always a good pointers boys the material
feels so good this is thing I love that
white box is that the material is always
so nice and such good quality which is
always what you want when you buy stuff
online because we've all had a few
online nightmares at the shore so here's
how they look from behind this side I'm
so wearing these on nights out I'm so
happy that everything fits so well and
then these are the other shots that I
chose these ones really suck in the way
like that and I really like these and
love the shape of them how they like go
out and give you like a really nice
shape to your hips as well it's really
really really flattering so you can see
it'll up close and personal this is how
the shorts look they are absolutely
gorgeous they fit so happy normally
things we never fit me right now like
yes but I'm loving this outfit combo and
everything I graduated from behind they
are like that so I was thinking as well
if you guys could let me know in the
comments what your favorite outfit is
that I put on let me know I'd love to
know different opinions of what outfit
you think look good on me I am now going
to get just those amazing yes it's like
another jumpsuit like a really colorful
one to have your side I am in love how
beautiful is this jumpsuit like as soon
as I put it on I'm like okay I need a
moment right now because this is so what
stunning I absolutely love this so I'm
like anything else that I have so
beautiful and I love the color I love
the print the materials gorgeous it's
nothing mean at the way and I love the
legs one thing about these jumpsuit same
with the black one that I had on earlier
now so comfortable I just feel like free
and flowy and there's it's like so comfy
so like girly and matching my plant in
the background as well my mom is going
to love this one I know she's going to
like color I love it
okay ask our filament section I wish you
spend like dancing around in this
chemistry because I just love it so much
so I'll give you a little close-up view
but I just think it's star different
than anything else I ever have and I
actually just texted a photos it's my
mom so I know she's going to love it so
funny this is so like my mom I think
you're going to love this and she's like
I love you do it next I picked this sort
of off the shoulder very flowy cute
dress I feel like these are so in at the
moment I see everyone wearing like off
the shoulder pieces and I thought I want
to join in with it right now it feels
like silk like it's honestly so nice and
easy to move in I felt with this I think
I think it'd look really nice with the
belt to kind of give me some shape and
suck it in a little bit I definitely am
loving this and I'm loving the quality
so good and just too quickly so over the
top how amazing is this jacket can we
just have a mic and say like I feel like
a little professional businesswoman
there couldn't hug it so I love it
because I don't have jackets in this
color like I always pick black and like
everything else the quality's incredible
and again just so that you can see it
all up close here is a close and
personal look at the jacket you can see
all the detail like in the sleeves and
then in here would desert in this way
it's such a beautiful piece okay now
this next outfit is something very
different to me when I saw it it made me
think of Miss crystal can we just take a
moment to appreciate how incredible this
is and he is the back of the dress well
I think that this is like nothing short
of amazing I just think that it's
absolutely amazing oh cool next I have
this jumper which I'm going to show you
here it's not wearing shorts or anything
this is written appropriate but I
definitely prefer it like off the
shoulder and a mascara we are going into
winter now
so this is perfect and you can see from
the camera we have fluffy and warm this
in I love how I thought we teach you
have place you add a waist up ready for
winter because definitely Melbourne is
getting colder now it's good to stock up
on the stuff now this or get through the
code they still of me it so warm
good and when I saw that white fox batik
have acted where now I was like hell
yeah these types of so gorgeous when it
comes with this tops as well persecute
that I love it so they fit really well
the tights are such good quality which
is forward because sometimes some active
wear is a venison
this definitely feels really nice it
stops really nice the top is like super
low cut on the back as you can see I
missed how high up see pants go I'm
definitely going to wear this gym it's
such a nice day oh my god I'm so happy a
light box of activewear yeah yeah and
then last but not least we have got this
great playthrough so silky so gaily so
beautiful this is a strapless place it
was grows up to there again I do not own
a gray play suit that's why it's because
the back looks like this really slowly
it's really girly it just fits really
nicely feel so silky feel such good
quality I love it and so that completes
the amazing clothes that I got from
