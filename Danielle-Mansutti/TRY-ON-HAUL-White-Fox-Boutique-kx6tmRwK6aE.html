channel I am so excited about today's
video because I'm working with one of my
favorite online boutiques of all time as
you've seen from the title below is
white box boutique I absolutely adore
and of course I have a discount code for
you guys so it's here on the screen if
you would like to use it for shopping on
white box routine so this consists
mainly of black clothing
what a surprise oh my god I picked a lot
of black clothing so before we jump into
the video if you haven't already joined
a family all you do is hit the subscribe
button below I put up two new videos
every single week and I would love to
have you on board a little like fam here
on YouTube it would be amazing from
without further ado let's jump into it
the first item of clothing I like to
share with you is absolutely gorgeous
white crop this is the kind of thing
that I love to wear when I got clubbing
a lot to where they like high waist
jeans or big skirt quality this is so
nice I love house isn't like a really
kind of thin cheeping kind of thing it's
thick and it's gorgeous and the sleeves
oh my god I have the biggest issue with
finding sleeves that I actually like I
like the fact that these lips are a
little bit longer than normal I hate it
when they cut like that I love the shape
of this shirt I love the quality of it
I'm definitely going to get a lot of
uses out of these when I go clubbing
trust me
I actually choose quite a lot of pants
for my haul as well and I know if your
name that means undies brightest mean
like pants and like trouser pants give
you perfect sense so these are these
sort of like leathery feeling pants they
have a zip up the back which I love and
they are like the perfect like me and I
would definitely wear this with
something like that white top which I
just showed you before this I love the
feel this as well it's really really
really nice and you can tell it's
actually quite a quality it is stretchy
the words which is good so that it will
actually fit everyone as well
but I just love the zip on the back it
can kind of make you like a booty
evening don't you when I saw this next
piece on their website I was like I have
to have that Lydia has made written all
over it
it
a dress with a very very very high sort
of like it's like that total making
their client kind of thing it is so
gorgeous
it is such a nice land and it suits
perfectly some of the boots that I got
from white box petite as well so I'll be
showing you those boots just in a second
talking about this dress first
I love it it's not too thick which is
gross you can store it in summer and
stuff like that
I just love long sleeves I love high
necklines you guys know that I mean what
am I wearing right now and speaking of
the boots check yeah I haven't owned
high boots like this before so these are
like my first high thigh high whatever
your to call them boots that I own they
come all the way up above my knee
they're so beautiful
it's the most gorgeous soft texture ever
I could just sit here and like pet these
shoes out so quick these shoes are so
surprisingly comfortable as well and
they're just so lovely they can make any
outfit just look like 10 times better I
am going to be wearing these so much
next I have this absolutely beautiful
set in black once again this is the top
bit this is like these sort of boob tube
on the top and then on the bottom we
have got these parents that go with it
as well these are high-waisted pants
that are a little bit stretchy at the
top they have a zip on the side as well
these feel very volunteer and very
gorgeous I saw this that I thought it
looks so classy
so just elegant and nice that I had to
get it I don't own any kind of set like
this I was like damn I need that the
next thing that I picked up is this
absolutely gorgeous bodysuit is
absolutely perfect for me for clubbing
because it is exactly the kind of thing
that I wear it's the high neckline it's
mesh and the thing is about these sort
of bodysuit leotard things when I first
saw them I was like they'll be the most
annoying things to wear when you go to
the toilet and that kind of stuff but I
actually really avoided them but I have
recently taken the plunge instead of to
wear stuff like this more and it is so
flattering because if you're wearing a
normal top it will get kind of baggy and
I don't know it just looks a bit like it
just
you it makes it everything just sort of
look nicer and all together and
everything that makes any sense I can't
wait to wear this when I got next time I
will definitely be getting a lot of uses
out of this I next I picked up some
bralette because I'm very obsessed with
them right now
I got a white and a black one in the
same style I am loving the fact that
bralets are very right now I'm also
feeling very happy to be part of the
itty bitty titty committee because I can
actually wear these and I love them the
next pants slash trousers that I chose
are very similar to the other two except
they do help them small differences so
this is another pet it is very similar
feel to this first pair that I showed
you however the top of it is very
different so this is a lot more sort of
like a business pant I would say this is
on the hardware more like something
smart doesn't see with me going to all
my business meetings and all that
important stuffs but sort of like more
of an exact pee tube oh my god executive
look cárdenas feet and these are from
of the timing miss brand that you can
buy on white fox meetings for just
amazing their stuff is such good quality
so trust me
thanks you have an absolutely beautiful
tiger mist item from the or white fox we
take website this is a dress as you can
see it is mesh so I was like hell yeah
I'm getting that
because it's really fitted around the
waist is extremely flattering as well
because it sort of like gives you that
hourglass shape too
I love dresses that have a zip as well
because just kind of sucks you in and
your luxury so you can wear bra this and
it doesn't look weird on the mesh
anything because it's sort of like
designed for that so it looks really
gorgeous you could just wear this feel
that bright you want but I'm someone
that does like wearing brown I go out
otherwise I just feel a little bit too
free if I'm out there Brown and I have
somewhat booties star boys once again
they feel extremely velvety just like
the gray ones as well I actually prefer
these on me than the grey ones and I
think that's because they're black but
they're slightly different design and
I'm very impressed with how well they
keep their shape as well a little bit
scared that they sort of fall and
collapse a little bit but they've kept
their shape so well they are extremely
comfortable
can't believe but she's like this
actually really comfortable and they
look amazing
next I have this jump or sweater pull
over
whatever you like to call it I have been
wearing this so much this week probably
see from like my live effect hands
taking some label I am loving this
jumper it looks amazing with black jeans
or black leggings it has these slits on
the side as well which is nice because
it doesn't look too bad here if that
sort of opens it up I definitely want to
get this in more colors because I love
the style this so much think you are
like the sort of business e executive
kind of thing I picked up at this
amazing coat as well
I just don't own anything like this and
I'm so glad that I picked this up so I
can wear stuff like this to meetings and
look really smart and know what I'm
talking about I like kind of stuff I
love the gold buttons as well but
details and buttons are so gorgeous too
it's not too thick which is great
because you can just like right over an
outfit not get too hot sweaty I got like
you can some other places and finally of
course I have to pick up some icky
studies these are the key Australian
collaboration with desi Perkins
sunglasses and these glasses are the TOI
SM glasses because I have like a really
big database it looked a lot smaller me
than they're doing desi I still love
them they are so different and so unique
but I love the fact that white fox batik
stocks the key Sony's as well I've
always got making these Emmys from
whitefox boutique and I always will
because they're very affordable on the
website and they have like the entire
range so that's why I had to pick up
some deadly ones while so it was like
why would I not desi is literally like
an angel I love that woman to bit she's
just like Isis I say a massive thank you
for watching this spy if you could leave
in the comments what your favorite
outfit was of the triangle that would be
amazing
I checked you guys really soon and I
have a great week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
