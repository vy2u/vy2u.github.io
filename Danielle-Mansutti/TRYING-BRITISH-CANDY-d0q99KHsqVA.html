recently go back from England and when I
was over there I picked up a whole bunch
of English sweets aka candy but in
England they're called sweets so I went
to a sweet shop in the Trafford Centre
and I got a whole heap of stuff they
after like the old-school retro sweets I
suppose so I have not tried the majority
of these however as I did spent my
childhood in England as if you sweets in
here that I haven't tried in like 18
years so I don't remember what it tastes
like and also just say no I do have a of
logging town which I didn't vlog on when
I was in England I'll leave it up here
you can go subscribe to my vlog channel
it would mean the world to me I would
love you so much
I've never filmed a tasting video by
myself either I normally have done it
with friends this is going to be really
funny to do it with myself but I'm so
excited get some sugar my body let's do
this so the first thing that I am going
to eat day I don't know if I've ever
tried before this is called a giant
scissor
as if as a visible further I'm really
excited this I'm assuming it will be
like a fizzy sweet really Danny really
oh my god that is so sweet oh my god you
stole it it's like oh yeah that was
satisfying I want another one this is
gonna get me like the biggest sugar high
of my life I can already tell I'll write
each and every sweet that I try I'm
gonna give these a 6 because I didn't
like it I swallowed it and then I wanted
to know one that's a good sign I think
there's a candy necklace in here do you
guys remember these these are like my
primary school life are you still like
bright more teeth on these oh my god yes
oh yeah okay I've never tried this
before this is called an atomic fire
blast I'm really bad at opening stuff by
the way guys like I'm horrible
God ever hot hard candy sweets okay oh
my god that is sorry fact I don't know
it tastes like old people with like a
musky like fiery kind of taste oh my god
that was horrible I'm giving that a zero
by my god who remembers these flying
saucers it's literally just a little
candy shell and all that's inside of
sugar so
I think this tanja kind of makes
everything seem like it tastes better at
the time well I can taste is like
chemicals and sugar toll flying sources
I was so excited to try you again I'm
going to give you the three next I'm
going to try this which is a fruit salad
I've not tried these before so I don't
know if they're like a really retro
sweet or something they're individually
packaged like this so they're kind of
like but this one here is annoying me so
bad so that kind of like starburst I
guess okay so it's kind of like pink and
orange
that's likes Thomas but more
artificially tasting and keep that a
five I probably would never buy it
myself but it's not that bad hello what
we have here we have Ghostbusters
popping candy ingredients sugar glucose
syrup water flavoring carbon dioxide and
color part of a healthy diet
finally nervous this is weird
what oh my god it's for being my third
oh no one really likes popping candy for
the taste that sound that sound just
tells you like damn that's a really
healthy snack
look at that gets a six out of ten the
strawberry lime is a bit but I do love
the whole popping experience my next
week our refreshes I don't remember what
these taste like I do remember the
packaging of it from my childhood but I
have not had some at this in a long time
I don't remember what it is it says it's
a lemon flavor chew with a refreshing
Center interesting oh my god this is top
oh it has no artificial color not like
that matters with everything else I'm
eating I think I completely missed the
refreshing Center all that was was like
a lemon chew a very hard lemon shoe that
in the packaging there is a lot of like
white powder I'm assuming those meant to
be like sherbet in the middle of
something but completely miss that
freshest get a vibe from me okay so this
next one I'm very scared without I'm not
gonna lie this is called toxic waste it
is a red sour candy reason why this
scares me is because on the back of a
product it says caution consuming more
than one piece at a time may cause
irritation to mouth sensitive
individuals should not consume this
product so it's safe to say that I am um
quite scared right l can't even open the
packet is tell it's like a sign guys
saying don't eat me so that's what it
looks like it's very little hopefully
one do too much damage to me I'm scared
okay okay
oh oh oh my god oh my god my cup Irina's
a dark crime you can taste the sourness
in your throat and it's like lethal like
that is insane
I'm not even going to write that that's
not enjoyable the next one I am well
away is not actually English but I found
it in the English sweet shop and my mum
was like you need to get that and try
that but obviously it's contrary
chocolate and right at the top it says
Swiss chocolate liqueur and I figured
since I bought it
I may still try it I've never tried
alcohol chocolate before and I don't
know if this actually has alcohol in it
or just the flavor of Cointreau I'm
really excited to try this a really big
pieces so it's like this first alcohol
chocolate in my life
Oh oh my god I'm gonna get like drunk
now I did not expect the fact that the
inside of the chocolate is actually pure
alcohol with your I literally just had a
shot of Cointreau I don't know how I
feel about that I thought it would be
like a like a flavoring like you know
Kabri snap like that sort of like
flavoring but that was intense
holy moly I'm gonna give this a good fat
three out of ten next we are going to
have some fun gums oh my god these are
cute
and these are good
oh my God look at the cutest little
toothbrush definitely need that after
eating all these late
I actually really like those I'm
definitely giving those at seven because
I need like a whole pack of those for
sure they're really really really good
right now I'm not looking for this one
at all this is mums doing so thank you
mom she said you got to try these
salty squid right we'll make our
delicious mum
oh my god
that's just like I'm funny that is
disgusting that it's so disgusting I
actually feel really not like really
sick right now that was horrible Hey oh
so disgusting I was getting to zero that
is much disgusting right I never get
that taste out of my flavor
I mean taste out of my flavor up that
flavor out of my mouth right away
because that was horrendous or I'm gonna
try these palm violets take my father oh
my God my body is not agreeing with what
I just ate mmm I remember these and
these awesome these are good wearing
that playground awareness huh um Parma
violets you get a seven because you are
everything and that was we trying some
ranch our English candy / sweets
I really hope you guys enjoy that I feel
so incredibly sick now that I'm probably
gonna go run up and be sick because that
was just like crazy the most disgusting
thing my father was this it actually
like I couldn't even laugh but how
revolted I was with this I could have a
laugh because it was sad that that was
salty squid was actually like the devil
it was horrendous
so please only ever buy some like that
if you want to like prank your friends
or something because it's so bad my
favorite is probably the fun gums I
really really really love them the
contrary chocolate was just like it's
just like unexpectedly like whoa so I
really hope you guys enjoy this video

love you so much bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
