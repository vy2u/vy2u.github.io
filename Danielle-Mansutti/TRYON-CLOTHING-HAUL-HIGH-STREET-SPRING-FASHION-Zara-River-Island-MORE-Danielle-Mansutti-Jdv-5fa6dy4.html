in today's video I took a little damage
on the high street recently there mainly
a massive fall from Zog also remind and
Yankee Candle as well farewell also
unfortunately if he fails as well which
I'm gonna have to go back over time it's
just a little bit of a bummer because I
wanna lose really impatient people who
just like doesn't really try and close
in this door I'm flustered of looking in
the mirror feeling bad about myself you
know what they have those mirrors that
reflect thank you Bob when you look at
yellow so I'm gonna go ahead and get
stuck into this hole we mi reading today
we're just hanging out and I can't wait
to show you all the bits and pieces that
I bought everything that I got will be
in my description but if you need to
find it I've been like clear enough I
got the names or anything like that to
it will be in the description bar that
further ado let's jump into it nicely go
ahead and sum up a lot for this first
hop is from Zara it's this really really
really cute flowy top with the most
amazing sleeps ever no I pick this up
cuz my neck as you know I love a bit of
high neck action
didn't realize until I got home and I've
noticed this with a lot of desire
clothes it's a massive disappointment no
care we ever see probably not because of
the exposure but on the collar there's
like someone's foundation line and they
on the inside of like orange and stuff
and that's just like disgusting I don't
understand why my clothes are that's
weeks old when they have foundation box
laughing but I was an idiot you didn't
ride along sorry I didn't know so off to
it I do love this hope it's flowy
it's beautiful it's like fun with the
slaves and everything I do really like
it but it's just a shame that it's daddy
there's more Zara clothes that are
actually dowdy which we'll go into at
the end as well and I'll grab the next
piece which is this really really really
nice flowy kind of denim jacket really
jacket it's really thin so it's really
easy to wear I like spring summer time
and the whole purpose of this whole is
more like a spring or because I feel I
wear so much black but since moving to
England I really introduced color to
myself and I feel like I just really
wanted to kind of breathe out my water
and make it a bit more mature and make
it a little bit more like 23 24
not like 18 year-old girl anymore which
is so often what I kind of am stuck in
for some reason so I wanted to pick some
pieces which are just nice going
feminine and flowy so next I picked up
these shorts as well now I'm not sure
about that I think because they're quite
a strange style I guess it's probably
the belt one that on they do look really
nice but they are kind of like smart
shorts you can animate if it's really
warm and I want to wear like a nice
outfit but I don't want to get too hot
my normal denim shorts are fit
inappropriate for that I suppose so
these are like smart shorts for like
smart short meetings and stuff face
literally story I know if you can hear I
also picked up some knits as well this
one is in grey and I also have a black
one and I absolutely love this these are
one of my favorite clients from my hole
I just love the feel of it it feels so
soft it feels really good quality and
it's just so flutter anyway I just
really really really really like star
and I find it really cute how the arms
have like little beads on the sleeves as
well and then same goes again with the
black one and it has a little bit little
details from sleeve it's just something
which is so very me because how many
makeup tutorials have my film right a
long-sleeve black knit like it's just so
so so so me if I haven't mentioned
already everything that I'm showing you
is a size 8 I'm the size 8 slash small
except for like jeans and shorts or 7
only 10 because of my hand and something
a little bit different as well moving a
little bit away from clothes and I went
to Yankee Candle they have that one
store in Brighton Churchill Square and I
let you wait here this morning and I
sniffed everything in the store for
about a good 20 minutes and the man came
over to be just like me alright I just
like to see things II was like okay
however I went in there with the
intention of obviously getting X candles
I didn't realize they now stop or own
another brand
be open this petition it won't be
rustling all the time as well I'm
seriously so chuffed when I found these
because my boyfriend has these like on
his outdoor table and I don't know I
didn't know the brand the brand is
called wood wig and I'd literally never
heard of it and as you can imagine the
wick is made of wood he has one which is
like this shape and because of the long
wooden wick down the middle it kind of
like crackles and it just makes the
strongest Senate the strongest smell and
you get the most out of it because the
thing is Fi with candles I love high-end
premium candles but I just find that
sometimes they don't really smell that
strong and it can just be such a mess of
shame when you have spent so much money
on a candle and you can't smell it so
right now I'm wishing you had
smell-o-vision this first one here is in
vanilla and sink so it smells absolutely
amazing and it's so nice summer and I
love love love love a long wick other
when I picked up is called warmer wool
and it is a really like comforting send
it to me it's very homely look it smells
like fresh linen it might just homely
sense it's very kind of nurturing and
that's really weird a smell check out
Ludwick they're amazing and they cost
about 20 to 25 pounds each and then
massive like they're gonna last me a
long time so I have these really really
really cute rouses from River Island as
well
I picked things up this morning and to
me they're just very kind of like each
holiday esque slash European holiday I
am doing so much traveling over the next
few months like it's it's insane how
much rad thing I'm doing I'm literally
going to about five places in a month
I'm going to create at one point just
like a nice little holiday these are the
kind of things I'd love to wear to
create I think that'd be perfect and
then we create in mind I also picked up
this really really really pretty white
top and when I try this on before on
camera three cars I was a little bit
unsure about Les Deux
like I was just pairing it with the
wrong kind of houses but I do think on
its own it is a really really really
pretty top and again very summery very
spring let's just hope that England has
warm weather soon stuff and then I also
picked up these white jeggings from
River Island as well I was a little bit
worried that the back would be like
completely see-through Nicci or my bum
and all my undies because it is such a
thin materialist so I'm stretchy so it
was really smart the way that the
pockets are designed it just makes it so
you can't like see through to the bomb
which is right I'm not very tight and I
do find that with jeggings they
obviously stretch over time so I'm not
too stressed about that and I really
really really like them I also just
picked up some black leggings from River
Island as well I really like the fact
the top of this has that kind of
waistband like a lot of my gym leggings
have to make sure your bum look around
doesn't actually is it's really
flattering and I love leggings that are
super high waisted like this because it
just kind of sucks everything it the
most disappointing thing for me of the
hole was a white coat that I have from
Zara now I don't have any hands because
I've let you put your bag to put back to
her tones it costs 80 pounds and it
wasn't until obviously I've tried it on
when I got home on camera with you guys
I've realized it was so dirty and I just
thought that it's just such a shame why
would that be on the rack it almost
looks like it's been over black marks
all over it looks really disappointed it
and I just kind of felt like as a size 8
it was just a really weird fit like I
couldn't make it
not like a like a hotel dressing gown or
something it just looked not how I would
have liked sorry I will be returning it
and 480 pounds I mean oh god it's a lot
of money so I'm definitely going back to
return that one but I am saving my best
for last my ultimate favorite thing that
I picked up up my whole granite it is
this amazing amazing coat from Zara I
think this is just something that I have
wanted for so long and the color as well
is not like
anything else that I have and this just
says a woman interview says independent
businesswoman to me it's smart its
feminine it's sexy I love it it feels
like there was amazing quality and it's
so flattering on this is gonna become a
new favorite of mine I'm just so excited
like it's everything that I've been
looking for in a code but I'm so happy
with it I'm so excited to light these
candles well they are living as you guys
know there will be another video on
Sunday this week we get to two uploads
