a special guest for today's video
this little puzzle he's actually growing
a lot since you have thought you're new
to my channel my name is Danny and this
gorgeous little thing is called bee
today we are going to do the test my
puppy's intelligence tag I believe it
was jenna Marbles that kind of started
this whole thing
I like Google I mean I use YouTube today
I'm gonna copy the ones that a youtuber
called Kelly Louise killjoy has done
with her dogs let me give you a little
intro of this crazy little thing that is
addicted to eating hair this has been
she is officially four months old like
tomorrow she is a pure pug who is
extremely attractive and the
best-looking Park I've ever seen in my
entire life she is a cheeky little
manner she is my best friend I
absolutely love her to be at some talks
had to test her intelligence so the
first thing that I'm gonna do which I
saw in Kelly's video was to place a
towel over your dog's head and to time
how long it takes them to get the towel
off we are very excited about the towel
aren't we let me get my stuff boys ready
baby I meant to be smart right now I
believe in you we took you 20 point 21
seconds Missy says place a treat under a
towel while your dog watches how long
does it take for your dog to find the
treat oh jeez okay see the tree
where's the treat it's right there
2,000 years later okay now we're
absolutely tearing the tail to pieces
you lose it's there look and now I have
a broken tail that went really well so
after that flawless performance and my
beans I mean I'm just so stunned by
right now the next one says place three
cups upside down on the floor place a
treat under one of them while your dog
watches and lead your dog at the room 30
seconds how long does it take your dog
to find the cup with the tree so we have
three red cups and have another treat
its weight
come with me Ellen and Lily and then
back in all right this is like pod cam
go where's the tree did you yay is that
the one with the tree is this the one
with the tree ah there it is
whoo-hoo next on the agenda we have go
and get your dog's leash does your dog
either one get super excited and run to
the door
does it get excited and do nothing what
does it not get it at all he only
started walking like a few weeks ago
only started to establish that walking
is a fun thing I'm not like a really
tedious annoying thing so I have a lead
right behind me but because she does
yeah you're getting excited what is it
what is it what is it oh you meant to go
to the door okay you can have the whole
thing where you gonna go
that's good come on let's go which mice
door let's go to the 200 we're not too
sure with the front door Binay where's
the door Sabini I think you got about I
don't know maybe like half a point out
of three so we it's good job baby yeah
you should show everyone what she can do
what I have trained her to do so far
because then you'll see that she
actually is a little bit indulgent
apologies about the lighting in this bed
but this way you can actually see her do
her tricks
let's show them your trick so far oh you
just not you got a stand
come come sit leave it go on yeah she's
it delegate we can do this down good
yeah so needless to say I think their
beans did average maybe a bit lower than
average shot but she's just a little
puppy and I think she did really really
really well I think we're gonna try this
with Coco next because Coco's for
college it than you even though you are
a lot cuter than so if you don't want to
see me try this dog IQ test with Coco
then please let me know because that
would be so much fun to compare a four
month old pug puppy with a seven year
old Labrador Retriever I was a lot of
fun if you guys want to read throughout
this video that I'd love to see your dog
to the IQ challenge for me and beans
that's all we hope you enjoyed today's
video I'm winning so many kisses have
you guys have an amazing week and we
will see you all very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
