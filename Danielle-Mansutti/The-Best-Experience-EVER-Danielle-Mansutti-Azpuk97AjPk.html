excited I'm going on a pizza crust day
the movie Coco with so as you guys know
I am such such a Pixar slash a Disney
fan obsessed so I'm in temperature scale
right now you might remember my older
block from here which I will leave in a
card for you up there to go and click
and check out so I'm so excited to see
all the hunt scenes of the Kodachrome
movie see the Pixar studios there's lots
of drilling going on outside so it might
be live in a second but check out this
year San Fran you are beautiful just
gonna feel like a little kid I could see
so many little things my toy store and
I'm like bitch leaking out right now
this is so cute and I see it's just the
coolest day of my entire life
raw sausage dropped in a barbershop I'm
gonna be doing a voiceover right now
she's so cool so if you need me to go
through the whole process whatever it is
I am terribly allergic so I just it's
time what you still event by the way
that was like the studio that
neighborhoods
all like the Disney
you know once I've is emanating it's so
cool
one thing that I got down there and like
do it later it was like experience where
I started drawing and in this case I
like this little gesture so now I'm
gonna hit that straight up it's gonna
have a little bit of inter okay so this
is the cheekbone who knows how many
though this is his mouth now throw this
in the black piss it's a negative space
going back down all the way up here so
you can you just have the drawing class
with one of the animators Koko and I
should people he's done so much work
like this
which as many of you know me as like
what
she's so incredible like we watch too
many movies
many cocktails your pain
he said the end I had to sell them out
thank you but that's why we drew some of
the characters from the cocaine maybe
that was my pour a bit but it was so
much fun
hi my love's I'm about to interview the
three most important people like oh my
god I'm gonna interview the director the
writer I'm the producer I'm just making
sure that's the right title
I find that even though it's like the 1c
animation and is quiet like a children's
genre I think as an I believe in
appreciated so much more as well do you
find that you have the specific
demographics
to watch it
we really try to make them for everybody
even to me if there's any secret to what
we do we try to make movies that we want
to see and then I just make sure they're
appropriate for everybody else we know
kids are gonna come so we never ever
target in any of the movies we've made
bad kids
we just try to tell great stories and
make them hopefully appealing to
everybody and it's hard it's really hard
to do that but that's that's what we've
always tried to do
in 1994
every time that we see it be somewhat
respect mr. Issa Oh interesting to hear
we think that
I'm not wait to watch the movie and so
excited which made me unfocused what I
saw so far was so good once I get back
to my hotel room
hey guys I just got back to my hotel
room I can't explain to you how like
nostalgic and surreal I think surreal is
the best way to describe today because
I'm just I have this connection with
like Disney and Pixar movies I always
have to actually meet the director and
interview the producer and the assistant
director and the animators and the
editors and everything it was just so
incredible to me that I feel like I'm
dreaming either I'm very jet-lagged or
like I wish you feel like I'm dreaming
it was just such a cool experience so as
I'm filming this is October you're gonna
see this in a few months I'm sure once
it's actually out in the UK I'm gonna go
to a screening and then I'm going to let
you know how I found the movie in full
because from what I've seen so far it's
so good so I'm so excited to see the
full screening as well so you might see
me looking either a little bit different
or a little bit the same but basically
this is my San Fran part of the blog and
now let's fast forward into the future
hello guys this is so exciting because I
have waited for a day like this for so
long I want to organize some editors
since forever and I'm going to the
screening tonight Coco with you guys I'm
so excited that my subscribers are
coming along to my screening with me
like honestly meeting you guys always is
the highlight of my year so any
opportunity I get to meet you I am there
so I'm so excited to meet you guys
tonight I'm just wearing something very
very very casual as well the thing is
like I was a little bit worried about
like what to wear but then I thought I
might as well go like as myself you guys
are gonna make me sorry I'm swearing
this jacket which is from boda skins
I've got some Nike shoes on and some
jeans and then just like a white shirt
which is very me
and I'm about to head off to London to
meet you and I'm so excited for the
screening I'm so excited to finally see
Coco in full because I only got to see
about twenty to thirty minutes of the
movie in San Francisco because the movie
actual isn't even finish then we were so
lucky to see the non-final printer of
half of the movie I guess but it was so
good at the first half that we did see
was so good so I'm so excited the second
half and I'm so excited to see you guys
there today as well so much ahead to
London I'm going to take you along with
me and let's go so I have arrived at
Disney where we're having this screening
and everyone is arriving and it's so
exciting just so like intimate and nice
so I'm gonna be entering the film and
stuff in a second I'm really excited to
actually see the movie the hallway
thoroughly I cannot wait so I just got
home and oh my god the full movie is so
good I actually shared it here as well
like everyone in the audience was like
like Snoopy it's so emotional as well
like you don't expect it's like pull on
your heartstrings as much as it does but
like it's very very emotional and very
good and I'm gonna go watch it again
because I absolutely love the movie I
loved having you guys there with me to
experience it all I want to make sure
that I switch like every single person
who came because it means the world to
me that people came all that way for
that experience I had like four people
who came from Scotland today and I was
like what like that and say I can't
appreciate enough people making a
journey down as well like it means
everything and had such a fantastic time
with you guys the coolest thing like
watching the movie I was thinking I know
I know the voice of people for that I
know like the character designer for
that and won't stop so having the
experience in San Francisco just made
the movie like a million times more
special as well but such an incredible
experience and I'm so glad I shared it
with you guys so you need to see it like
it's so good and I hope you guys enjoyed
the vlog and I'll chat with you very
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
