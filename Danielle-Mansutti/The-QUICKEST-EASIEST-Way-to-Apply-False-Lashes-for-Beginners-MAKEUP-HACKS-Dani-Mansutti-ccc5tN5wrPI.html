welcome back to my channel in today's
video especially if you're beginner I'm
gonna teach you how to put a leash on
your lash and we will be using the new
danny b de luxe
collection lashes in today's video which
if you're watching us on friday november
10th is launched today on danny
beauty.com
i will link it below so you guys can get
your hands on these they're three decent
lashes they are gorgeous am i not
scented i'm obsessed
they're beautiful i'm wearing some right
now I would highly recommend using a
coat of mascara on your natural lashes
first just to ensure that everything
looks blended and as natural as possible
from the downy bt a luxe collection
today I'm using these styles
selphie and also ensure to remove your
lashes very gently like this I'm now
measuring it along my top lash line to
see if it will actually fit and if that
lash is too big for you I always cut
from the outer corner not the inner
corner the lash will look so unnatural
if it's cut from the inner corner so
always make sure to cut the end long
parts instead with your eyelash glue
just do a very light coating onto the
lash of a line just like this you don't
want to go too overboard because you
will end up with glue in your eyes it
takes a long time for this dry as well
so a bit of a dance
if it feels wet like this it's not
already but when it does come to
applying the lashes look down I find
this is the easiest way to apply it and
come up from the top over the lash like
this and just sit it down in the middle
then I grab the inner corner I place
that in and then I grab the outer corner
afterwards I just think from top to
bottom and look down so here's a better
angle you can see my natural lashes are
pointed a lot more down than this
but applying it this way it actually
gives the best effect because the fake
lashes are sitting upwards and they look
long and beautiful and then with my
tweezers depending on how squeamish you
are I like to actually stamp and clamp
the right word
Claire that lashes to our natural lash
like this and I just find that it looks
most natural if you don't like touching
your eyes that's fine I'm totally used
to touching my eyes so it's okay
but I also like to lift it up with my
little finger like this and it just
works look at this before and after it
is inside and that is how to get a lash
on your lashes yeah and you can't get
them on Danny be calm right now there's
such a quality it is so affordable for
what they are honestly I would love to
see you at them so make sure you tag
Danny beauty store and Instagram or any
much as well but that is it for me and
my little messy bun which is going all
around the place my hair is just like
not coping today so it's in fun but
anyway I'll see you guys very soon and
thank you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
