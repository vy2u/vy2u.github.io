so a little bit like an update style
video today I have some things to tell
you and some live updates as well and I
just washed my hair so it is looking a
lot darker than it actually is so don't
forget i haven't dyed it and he darker
it's just wet but i figured today's
video we just make sense for me to sit
down and chat to you I also have a
little bit of a blog to add at the end
of this video from when I went into the
houses of parliament to talk about
mental health which is such an honor
unbelievable that experience it's
amazing so I'll include that in the end
of this video but this video today is a
bit of an update I was gonna do up
putting on my makeup but I thought let's
just talk about let's just get straight
to the point and the point is is that
the day after you guys watch this I will
officially move out of this I am so
excited and so happy to be moving into a
different place because those of you
that follow me on Twitter and stuff know
this that hasn't been the best to me of
especially with the whole paranormal
thing super nosey that have been
commenting asking what the update is on
the whole like Paranormal Activity in
this flat the update is that it keeps
happening all the time so it hasn't not
how I mean it hasn't stopped like ever I
talked about three times a week I kind
of feel that presents still a little bit
less these days I suppose but I think
now that I've associated this
environment with that thing if you don't
know what I'm talking about I'll link my
paranormal beer up here I think
naturally just walking in here I
actually just feel it just because I
might something tricks on me anyway but
the new place guys it is so lovely
it's literally like my dream home and I
can't believe I'm gonna be moving there
it's way over my budget like where why
ideally what I might be spending for
rent but I figured I spend 90% of my
time at RM so it makes sense to kind of
like enjoy it you know what I mean
it's gonna be moving vlogs it's gonna be
home where hauls house tours all that
kind of stuff and what I want to ask you
guys today is to let me know
out of those three which is the type of
videos that you really want to see do
you want to see casual moving blogs like
which you burn up no-makeup moving stuff
around kind of vlogs do you want like
professional sit-down homo hauls do you
want professional proper house tours
I'll be moving out on Wednesday October
25th and I'm so so excited so I decided
12-month lease as well this one was for
six months obviously I haven't breached
in six months yet so I had like a bit of
an overlap but yes it's 12 months and
I'm very excited and I will let you guys
know I kind of like what was wrong with
this flat a little bit later on as well
but firstly I love a little a life
update is that I went to the houses of
parliament to equip mental health which
was just unbelievable I was planning to
vlog the whole experience the whole day
but it was a bit of a stressful one all
the transfer councils had to get into
our uber was like a hundred pounds and
it was just like oh my god it was a
nightmare so yeah southern bro I just
realized I'm not wearing a bra
Sorry Sorry nipples but not really sorry
cuz free the nipple and all that kind of
stuff but yeah I'm not wearing a bra
anyway I'm gonna include some of the
padishah that I used for the vlog of the
mental health part but yeah I suppose
when it comes down to the nitty gritty
truth of it all I've never really liked
this flat it's never felt like home to
me it's very dark it just that's like no
natural light it's just like I didn't
view this obviously I was in Australia
so I couldn't view the property before I
came in it so yeah it wasn't exactly
what I wanted the new place I might be
able to finally get a car again and
finally drop again and I'm so excited
about that I miss driving so much it's
not even funny like so much didn't even
realise how much freedom would feel like
we've been taken away from me by not
being able to drive it's crazy but I
hope you guys enjoyed the vlog portion
and let's get into it
hello guys I am just getting ready and I
thought I turn on the camera and
actually chats you aren't doing it so so
far I've done my foundation my concealer
my brows and the top of my lids which
all like sparkly and that
with the Knicks glitter and the naked
heat palette I was thinking this really
casual real chilled today because I'm
doing something so major like I can't
even believe that I'm doing it because
it's just such an honor I'm going with
digital label which are a mental health
organization they Center a lot around
cyber bullying and depression and just
mental health issues in general and I
think they're an absolutely incredible
organization so I'm getting ready for
that right now and I'm just like as I'm
getting ready I'm thinking about all the
things that I could say today or you
know that mean the most to me and really
want to get across in how's the pile of
Italy so weird to think that's an actual
thing that's happening try get my
anxiety at bay but so far so good I'm
not feeling too nervous but I mean
obviously anyone would be a little bit
kind of intimidated about the factors
you know how big it is what I'm doing
how big it is I'm doing how big what I'm
doing is I'm speaking with a bunch of
like TV presenters and a bunch of people
from digital label and proper like
scientists professors everything and
it's just going to be such a great thing
just to chat with so many from different
industries about it as well and get all
of our points of view across so I'm
mainly gonna be talking about stuff like
you know social media and how depression
and anxiety can kind of stem sometimes
through how much we are on social media
and everything like that I need to at
least today my favorite like natural
ones this whole YouTube I was just on
the cusp
we had a Mike Tyson innocent which is
great because homeless that was the full
big social medias like Facebook really
became the thing so I experienced
bullying from high school all the way
through high school I went to two
different primary schools - duper high
school so that reason and then in my
last few years of school I actually had
following me home because even back on
myspace great Facebook era it still
happened
so you come home and like I mentioned
before you employ everybody you know
couldn't do anything without hearing
these voices because they were
everywhere and at the time I didn't
really think about the impact that it
would have on me
but as I've grown older I've discovered
that is cause various triggers within me
and also caused a bit of a spiral with
my mental health and then when I again
is very interesting during it becoming a
youtuber which ones like that a lot I
started doing that with a bit of like
beauty tips and makeup and stuff that
would just kind of be like a fun hobby
other side then I kind of felt this
pressure the stigma that normally talks
at mental health and I just kind of felt
like it's this summer to talk about only
people kind of label those things that
way and this was about three years ago
or so and social media is advancing so
quickly every single day it's a rapidly
changing all the time I think now even
be free
it's almost supportive when it comes to
much help in it that nobody is getting
and at the time I was very scared and I
just thought you know what I'm just
going to sit down but if they'll told me
about my humbling experience at school
and my experienced depression and
anxiety and I record the whole thing I
was trembling the whole way 30 because
about to be terrified but I hit the
upload button and my subscribers were
incredibly supportive and the minute
that I saw all the support coming in all
the stories of people experiencing the
same thing I thought this means way more
to me than any magnet or ever would this
is my part is what I feel like I need to
be doing and I needs to be just helping
others as much as I can
the last two years or so it's been a
really big thing for me because I can
see on the social media perspective how
toxic it can be for young girls and how
there's so many issues these days we've
you know going small fear depression and
eating disorders and everything which
stems from social media because
essentially girls are comparing their
behind the scenes it was highlight reel
so many are trapped in this world where
nothing really makes sense and they
compare themselves or to other people so
I've decided with the audience that I
have to actually spread a message and
just be completely honest with them and
just literally post like I'm having a
really depressed day today my house all
day you know
everything must be probably happy a
positive time with human beings we all
feel emotion and that's why today we're
talking about this thank you very much
sorry but it's very kind of jumbled two
videos kind like an update / vlog I
don't even have to call it but basically
yes many books are coming and I'm so
excited
before I forget I actually did get a ps4
yeah that I just randomly because why
not
so if you are subscribed to my place to
teach a channel I will be doing a gaming
videos especially once I've moved out
and I've actually got like a proper set
up I've been doing gaming videos a lot
and I can't wait for that it's just
gonna be like a really fun hobby on the
sides it'd be great if you guys will
come and join me over there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
