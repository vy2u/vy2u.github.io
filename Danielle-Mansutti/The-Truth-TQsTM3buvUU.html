something very different so this is a
very probably the most raw real honest
video that I will ever post on this
channel because I'm doing the
stripped-down challenge right now I
don't make any edits I don't stop I
don't put on a fancy outfit I don't do
my head we'd wait there anything like
that
I don't adapt my arms and my old good
pauses because there will be a lot of
them and I don't edit out whenever I
think I look bad which is like a lot of
the video because I'm a very
self-conscious person so I added out a
lot of footage of angles I don't like
and all that ready for this stuff and my
top lip is already sweating and we're
like 10 seconds in oh okay I feel like
today's the perfect day to make video
because I wanted to sit down and make a
video like this with no cuts no edits
and be completely raw and honest with
you for a long time and today's the
perfect day because I have been hit by
the inspiration train today and
something is like reaching out to me
today and telling me that I need to
start like a new path in a nature and a
new journey see would edit it up okay
and a new journey so I don't really know
how to start this I need to comprehend
my thoughts in a way that projects and
portrays what I mean in my head and it's
very hard to do with words okay so
essentially YouTube let's start with
YouTube I feel you should know for two
years I said when I was 19 and now 21
I will range due to myself because
you're going to learn about the real me
right now so hello my name is Danielle
immensity I am 21 for another 48 hours
and I'm I'm gonna say oh my god this is
so hard to be editing okay I'm 22 one
side of the 4th of November got that one
out without a problem that's good I was
born in England I'm
- I was 12 so essentially I'm not
Australian I'm English and Italian and I
have a love and a passion for all things
creative I had a really really terrible
schooling life and it breaks on it
breaks my mum's heart
when we talk about him I talk about it
online because it was horrible for me to
go through its horrible fur to see me go
through it we were very sensitive people
so it was a really crap time where life
so yeah I was bullied and it changed who
I was as a person completely I was
believed pretty much my entire schooling
life through primary school in high
school and as I get older the more I
start to understand why and the more
actually reflect on why I feel very
lonely these days and it's because of
the same reason so I feel like I observe
those around me and I look at people
that look like they're really happy and
they're really fulfilled and they have
amazing lives and I think what are they
doing which is making them so happy and
so amazing everything and this is where
I've been my whole life because this is
literally a reflection of high school so
in high school I was the very very very
quiet girl in the corner that didn't
want to speak because of my English
accent and want anyone drawing attention
to me at all and I would literally sit
in a corner and sketch or write so my
entire life I've drawn or written it was
like my creative outlet and then it went
on to being painting and art it was like
the best feeling and most fulfilling
feeling I could ever make was to sit
down with my sketch pad and create
something in my head and make it come to
life on a piece of paper I have moments
in my life where I have that kind of
feeling of fulfillment and feeling proud
of myself and recently I have found that
within troubling I learn more more about
myself
before though I am away from home so I
learned Who I am when I'm far away
makes any sense and I feel like
traveling is the best education that you
could ever have like it is just I don't
even talk I've forgot no that's
priceless it's priceless like the math
to get out oh yes it's priceless
it really is it's the best thing that
you can possibly do it's you have to do
it yes trouble I often find myself
feeling very lacking in motivation and
inspiration to film makeup videos and
that's because growing up I was never
passionate about makeup and makeup isn't
really a passion of mine it's like a
hobby and I love creating really cool
looks and everything like that but I was
never trained and I often say I often
feel that there are so many more
youtubers out in the YouTube world that
deserve the recognition of a beauty guru
way more than I do because I can only
offer you as much as I've taught myself
which I don't really think is that great
but you guys have been very very very
lovely and watched me and enjoy my
tutorials and that means the world to me
in a way I wish I could reverse time a
little bit when I started YouTube and
from the beginning didn't solely rely
like my bread and butter on YouTube to
be beauty because although it's great
and it's what people want to see it
isn't like I don't know I don't get that
same creative feeling with makeup I feel
very restricted to what I can do
because you know I have to think in a
business mindset of what do people want
to search for they want to search right
know like a smokey eye tutorial or a
morning routine but I sit down and I
want to create short films I sit down I
want to create films I want to create
really personal inspirational
motivational movies and I want to spend
a lot of time going out to the world and
practicing my I don't know like my
cinematography practice my editing and
create things that make me feel
fulfilled and make me feel like just to
release that creative energy that I have
stored up inside of me because
YouTube's like my job and I have to
produce what the audience wants and what
I want to produce a lot of my audience
would be like I didn't sign up for this
and it sucks because I'm sort of stuck
in a limbo and I don't know the right
way to put this I know this is going to
be so heavily scrutinized and that's why
I find it so hard to express myself
online I feel like I'm the most raw and
honest with you when you can see me
being really goofy and really
comfortable with being goofy and in the
videos where I have spoke about things
like social anxiety and depression I'm
being myself in there like a hundred
percent myself and just be like an open
book for you and everything like that
but I feel it's so difficult when I know
that there's people and websites and
stuff that takes screenshots of me in
videos like in bad angles and blog
probably take screenshots of me in this
video and talk about like how ugly I am
whatever and in a way I wish that I
wasn't solely in just the beauty
community because I really dislike how
by being in the beauty community you're
ultimately scrutinized by your beauty in
your appearance and I definitely am NOT
want to my horn I have a lot of self
esteem issues and very self-conscious
and I almost have to like be character
online to sort of suit the role that
I've found myself in I honestly would
this is going to sound so bad okay no
it's not going to sound bad this is just
real okay to be honest with you like a
perfect weekend for me is like sitting
at home with my mom with a cup of tea
watching TV show um you know painting
playing The Sims reading a book looking
at memes like I don't know I enjoy
little things like that and then in a
way I feel so much pressure on myself to
be a certain person online and I
recently found myself you know stumbling
across this like health and fitness
I swear I was like trying so hard to fit
in with the other beauty gurus Bora Bora
because I knew that they have like
impeccable perfect bodies and I am just
a normal girl that doesn't really like
to show off her body and I never have
like this is what I wear all the time I
never wear nice clothes I wear hoodies
like were a trucker he's like it's just
the way that I am and I knew that I was
going to be around a group of people
that like I would be incredibly
intimidated by and scared to be around
because not like I wouldn't be accepted
but I kind of felt like I had to fit in
a little bit and it's completely what I
did away through high school like I
thought I was in a inadequate away I was
that I would pretend to be like the
popular crowd to fit in because I
thought like they were happy and then if
I would like them then I would be happy
if that makes any sense but I'm not
being myself and I am most happiest when
I am myself so I often find myself
feeling very lonely and very sad that I
don't have a lot of really deep genuine
connections with people or meet people
that I click with and then I realize
it's because it's not like my own doing
like if I'm going to put myself in a
group of people and I'm not talking
about youtubers or any one specific I'm
just talking like generally so don't
scrutinize um please I know really like
one side of you will scrutinize but I'm
literally not talking about anyone I'm
just speaking generally like I'm the one
trying to pretend to be someone there's
like super fit and super confident and
there's like blond loud chatty girl
which is fine because I am that person
sometimes but that's not me like all the
time and in order to be that way I often
find myself feeling broken piece because
I'm like I don't actually feel like
anyone really knows me and I hide myself
away from people because I thought they
would accept me and I mean even with my
my ex-boyfriend I was never really
myself around him because I always felt
pressure that I had to be a different
person and it made me miserable like
it's happened to so many friendships as
well where I pretend to be like a
different version of myself to please
them and to feel like that's what they
want to see and it ultimately makes me
miserable and if I just say I'm sweating
if I just took the time to make films
that I want to make to start blogging
again and writing again without worrying
about people scrutinizing and thinking
it's about people and spreading tweets
he will be like Danny shading you in
this whenever it's literally like I'm
not specific to anyone I'm very
comfortable of approaching people if I
have an issue with them I stay so far
away from youth drama because I do not
want to get involved though that side of
things at all and I'm so out of the loop
of you drama as well and I'm like that
because I don't want to be involved in
that so when people tell other youtubers
or try and make other youtubers think
that I don't like them
it's literally like oh like it's it
couldn't be more wrong it could not be
more wrong like I don't have a problem
with anyone and I wish I had the freedom
to create and express myself and make
things without worrying about what
people are going to think that it is
someone getting it is someone going to
get offended it's someone going to have
a got me is someone going to make a
massive deal out of this like is someone
going to send Twitter somewhere saying
it's shading them like it's so annoying
that I have to cause the thing about so
many things when I just want to like
write a blog post about friendships in
general like it's not about anyone kind
of thing and I feel in a way I need to
just say screw it like why do I not just
blog why do I not just make whatever I
want to make and if you don't like it
they don't like it but if I start being
more myself and creating things I want
to create for myself personally and
doing more things for our mental health
talking about bullying and so many
people get angry like I don't sign up
for your channel to look at something
about bullying whatever but I kind of
think like I need to stop caring so much
and to be like but there are so many of
you that do care about that like I have
now 1.3 million subscribers
and that is more than enough I could not
ask for any more than that I would never
imagined to have that many in my life
and so I guess in a way if I start being
more myself then maybe I will start
finding the right kind of people and
people who are like me because I need to
stop trying to like transform myself
into what I feel is the accepted beauty
guru kind of thing and where certain
clothes to fit in with that standard and
diet and exercise so much that I'm
miserable
eating chicken salad like every day to
like look a certain way and I think why
am I trying to conform like why do I not
just sit down be myself and it is
because from being bored I've always
felt like I'm not good enough always
like always and it affects me so much
because they're just everything like
it's so bad to feel that way about
yourself but I kind of feel like I'm at
the point now in my life where I've lost
a lot of people recently and I feel like
life's trying to take me in a new
direction and trying to say hey like
that chap is done let's move on to your
next chapter and meet new people and
have new experiences and it's very hard
because I'm 21 I've spent two years on
YouTube I've had to grow up on YouTube I
grew up on tumblr for about 13 to 19 I
made so many mistakes on tumblr looking
back at it I was extremely offensive and
horrible and stupid sometimes with
things that I said and did and I was so
young and stupid that I'm kind of glad
in the way I did certain things to make
me understand now to not do that and to
learn from my mistakes like I would just
be I was just replied people really like
stupid ways and be like sarcastic and
just be a bit bitchy and it was because
I was dealing with so much crap in my
personal life that like I kind of felt I
think that anonymous cool girl online
I'm not saying that I've sent hate to
anyone but I have to feel like sassy and
it wasn't me at all and I don't know
like it's so odd to live in a world
where I have to grow
up in front of millions of people
literally and I have to be so
politically correct all the time and I
can't offend anyone and I have to be so
like can't say this can't say that might
hurt this one this person will get mad
this is going to make my video girl too
disliked well or whatever and it's so
annoying like to never like I never ever
ever started YouTube wanting to be
famous that is the biggest thing I'm not
saying that I'm famous but you know what
I mean I'm sure there's many people that
want to start YouTube to be known but I
started YouTube to improve my confidence
and then here we go I would like 1.3
million of you that support me and love
me and I could have never asked for that
or never believed that would have ever
happened for me and I'm so blessed so
lucky that it happened to me and I'm
forever grateful I know you guys know
I'm genuinely so grateful to have you
all in my life but I hope that you
understand by hearing this that I'm just
trying to say that I feel I'm ready now
to start showing you me and showing you
things that are very important to me and
creating things that are important to me
and I know many of you won't like it or
won't be interested but I I don't know I
kind of these need to stop worrying
about what people will think and if
people approve of me and actually do
stuff for myself these days and I think
I'm finally starting to grow up and
realize like I can't live to please
everyone and live to make people happy
like I have to live to make sure that
I'm okay as well because I've not been
okay for a long time this year has been
the hardest year emotionally for me of
my life and it confuses people I
understand it confuses yuvan a complete
understand why people call me fake
because I laughed bubbly and happy and I
look at me like I'm going out with
friends whatever and then the next
minute be like all sad on snapchat it's
because I'm trying to I'm trying to
portray this character out into the
world of who I want to be this really
happy girl but deep down like I'm
different and then that sad version of
me comes out and I publicize it and I
shouldn't publicize it but I do um yeah
I don't know I just sort of feel like
the time has come to sort of start
messing with your changes and you might
notice gradually that my content will
change a little bit but it'll be for the
good I've got them and it will be the
good because you'll start seeing me for
who I am and I will start being more
secure with who I am and hopefully
meeting like-minded people and meeting
filmmakers and writers and people with a
similar interest to me and introverts
and just I don't know like I love to be
surrounded by people that will inspire
me in that sense and don't having to end
this how do you end this it's rooted in
this without anything but I just want to
sit down and be honest and I completely
and prepare myself and already know that
by making this video I'm going to get so
many people scrutinizing being like oh
this means this and this means that rah
rah rah Danny said this it means this
about this person but literally like I'm
just speaking my mind I'm not trying to
offend anyone like I'm just being me
right now and talking to you my bedroom
where my bed and chilling out and oh I
hope that I'm enough for you guys like I
hope me it's me is enough and I hope
that you will love me regardless because
I love you and I can't thank you enough
for supporting me for so long and I'm
getting really nervous right now
I don't know thank you so much for
watching this it does mean the world to
me that you watch it this far because it
shows that you do truly love me and I
love you back and let's fry this next
chapter of my life long together so
thank you guys so much for watching and
I'll see you all very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
