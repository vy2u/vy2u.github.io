and you can tell by my voice I am full
of cold and flu and it's fantastic so
thinking about moving out you already
have moved out you know you build me
about one day everything you could
possibly want or need to know about
moving out we're gonna discuss so here
are some things that everyone should
know about moving out I'm probably the
biggest decision when it comes to moving
out is if you're gonna share or live
alone now I've experienced both sharing
for a very short time and both of them
have their pros and cons if you want to
share you're gonna save yourself a lot
of money because you're gonna split the
bill you're gonna split the run at the
damn thing and you can pee with the
bathroom door but yes sharing is more
cost effective and also helps relieve
the stress and anxiety of moving out for
the first time because you've got
someone there you can help you
understand things even things like bills
they can just help you in general
especially obviously if they have moved
out of themselves before if you can't
really afford to furnish or anything
right now buying someone who's just
sharing out a room of their own
apartment because chances are it will
already be furnished yours pretty much
gonna sleep there and live there so if
decorating and stuff isn't really high
on your priority list then just sharing
in someone else's space is amazing in
terms of like saving money and
everything if you want to be living on
your own like I have for the past three
years or sorry you will gain a lot of
skills you will gain a lot of
independence and also you will learn to
love your company cuz you've gotta get
used to it I also find it very rewarding
to know that the place is yours and you
can do what you wish with it and you
come home and things have been moved
around and whatever I'm a little bit
like touchy about my things being in
certain places so if I were to live with
someone to come home and they've moved
everything it'll be World War 3 there's
something inside of me which is
literally just like help probably the
most important thing actually about
moving out is choosing an area because
you want to be safe first of all please
remember to always check the crime
rights and crime activity of the area
you're looking at now if you're thinking
about
and we're your family friends and nearby
I would I'm gonna see this so do you
wanna come on ordering oh my god oh my
god anyway so if you're thinking about
moving out with friends and family
nearby it's a hundred percent a good
choice because if you're moving out for
the first time as well you're gonna need
people every now and then to come out to
come show you how to do things or help
build I can't furniture so much fun make
sure that there's good transportation as
well it's so important to something that
I would not really like see there but it
is so important now if you're moving
into an area which you are quite
unfamiliar with by the venue country new
town new city whatever I would
definitely recommend taking about two
weeks or maybe even a week or so to
explore that area and that should get
air being these get different air babies
like every day every second day in a
different little part of that area
looking at going to an experienced kind
of living there but not really living
there don't get a hotel in that area
because I think in a hotel you can feel
like you're anywhere in the world but
staying in an air B&amp;amp;B like staying in a
house in the area that you like will
give you a clear understanding what's
actually gonna be like to live there
also check that you have a supermarket
nearby if you're someone who likes to go
to gym make sure the gym nearby
supermarket apart like stuff like that
make sure there's stuff nearby that you
need ok most important part which I
probably should have said first is
before you move out you shouldn't be
working and you should have savings
because there are so many hidden cost
when it comes to moving out and it is
the joy of being an adult
literally you think oh that's how much
rent is that's how much money I need a
month rent is just the start of it you
think about bills you're doing gonna
attack with my bills you know I've got
like my internet phone bill I've got my
gas my electricity in my water my hot
water I think is another envelope and I
also pay my council tax and then I also
pay another have a car like my car
insurance and my car tax and there's so
much other stuff and I've just
remembered I haven't
well I really need to do is what we've
hidden costs all the time and then even
I know for sure in England when you're
actually on a rent somewhere you then
have all the agency feeds from like the
estate agent and it's literally just
fees after fees after taxes after bills
and then you've got your food shop as
well so you need savings you need to
have money behind you because it is the
first like a month of moving in is very
expensive especially if like you're
living alone furnishing it yourself
because so much okay so I got them it's
ridiculous I went a hundred percent
recommend just getting lucky and stuff
to start with as time goes on by nice
and furniture but just get the
essentials at the start something
worthwhile noting as well if you move
out in the car cook what are you gonna
eat because you don't want to fall in
the trap of getting takeout every single
night is so much more cost-effective to
cook your own meals and to actually get
them delivered to you it's very
important to know how to cook and I mean
I can't cook I can cook like three meals
but at least I can cook three meals will
give you know to me do not sure but for
imaginary people buy what you need not
necessarily what you want because it's a
waste of money otherwise you don't to be
very sorry that's just gonna go to waste
because not only in certain life you
know a bank account as well and now
let's talk about the inevitable lonely
nervous something which I don't even
feel anymore I swear to God because I'm
so used to it but I love my company I
love living alone now totally depends on
how cool your landlord is but the best
thing in the world for learning this is
a pet just like this one right here so
I've just woken up and she's very happy
about getting a pet it's the best thing
ever if you live alone because not only
doesn't leave you responsible for
something else it also gives you someone
to dog do having a pet honestly is the
best thing ever for living alone and
well you just saw my pajamas oh I'm in
my
is 2 p.m. but I'll ever learn to Noah
notices so though however like I said
before I would strongly recommend if you
choose to live me or presence then you
get the best of both worlds you can have
your own space which is furnish your own
way the independent live on your own and
whatever you want to see your friends
you can just go and see them because
they down the road that in my opinion is
the best so when it comes to combating
loneliness is everything I would
definitely recommend to turning that
fuel into being creative so instead of
being bored and lonely being like
nothing's happening in my life just sit
down and be creative and paint or draw
or work plan out things like it's such a
good time to do things for yourself and
if you do not know who I am
you've never seen my face before I'm so
sorry that I'm so sick I feel very rude
for some reason talking to you with such
like a nasally it's not she know anyway
my little backstories that I moved to
England from Australia in June last year
by myself so I didn't know like anyone
in the area that I moved to and I've had
to kind of figure out life on my own and
can I just say I wish at school they
taught you how to do tax they taught you
right insurance why on earth did I have
to learn about Sally with her ten
watermelons and algebra when we needed
to know about important things like tax
and banks and insurance but that's
something for another video so I hope
you guys enjoyed this quick little tips
and tricks video and I'll chat with you
very soon what I'm hopefully a lot less
nasal and bundo so have an amazing week
and I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
