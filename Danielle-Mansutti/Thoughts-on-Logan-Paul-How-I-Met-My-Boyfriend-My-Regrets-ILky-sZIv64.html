today we are doing a Q&amp;amp;A I have got my
team at the ready and I asked you guys
to send me a bunch of questions through
Twitter a little while ago so let's just
jump into it right this first question
is amazing if you found out your current
life has just been a dream would you
choose to wake up you don't know if your
real life be better or worse that is a
crazy question oh my god I have shared
thought about that before I like reading
like conspiracies and stuff but I read
something which was similar to that
before but I think for me right right
now I choose to just keep living this
life because I love my job I'm in a
happy relationship my family is still
around so I think I'd say looks good at
the moment
yay have you ever gone through a phase
and you're 10 years old she completely
regrets
yes and you guys lived it with me or so
he did if you don't know when I was
younger this is about nine years ago
when I was 14 I like loved tumblr and I
was I thought I was some like cool
little like supreme wearing on future
little like gee I wasn't but that's just
figuring out who I was I don't regret
anything that I've done in my life
because I feel like everything you do is
to shape you and grow you to become like
your end person and that makes sense I
think we all need phases which we regret
from my teen years because they
ultimately will make us who we are today
and I think that is so important I mean
there's lots of things that I said and
did as a 14 year old to look back now
and I cringe so hard about I'm just like
oh my god I was so uneducated about
certain words or I was just so stupid I
used to pretend to smoke for photos and
stuff like that like that is stupid and
I just don't know I was not me yeah I
hadn't discovered me yeah and I went
through lots of characters I guess to
kind of find who I was and then
eventually I just stopped trying to be
someone else and I just became myself
when I hit my twenties and then
it was like on a skateboard and
listening to all that kind of like Oh
music and swearing all the time and
saying stupid words it just wasn't me at
all but I kind of needed that to to know
that that wasn't me if that makes sense
because if your publicity hasn't made it
harder to have real relationships how do
you know if someone's intentions are
genuine my late last four years of my
life have been very difficult
well that reason I've had a lot of
people come into my life who at first I
couldn't like seemed that they were in
for the wrong reasons but now it's so
easy for me to spot now I'm really
really big on energy when you meet
someone you always get an energy from
that person whether it's like really
positive and warm and friendly or if
there's something that's slightly off
about them you have to trust it or you
have to investigate it it seems in the
past a few people you've met may haven't
had a great energy because they've
confused my shyness for arrogance or
rudeness or whatever words I'm actually
sitting there like what do we say to you
you know I'm just breaking out and being
nervous in that sense if I get more of a
vibe that someone's a bit shy or a bit
reserved or a bit sort of anxious then I
will kind of take that energy and
investigate it and speak to them what I
want to get to know them and then if I
still pick up a rude vibe when I'm
trying to make an effort with him then I
go okay I'm gonna step back here it's
just so obvious to me now that when I
meet someone I can tell they're in like
three seconds if they want to use me for
something what their intentions are it's
just
yeah and I've become a pro at cutting
people out of my life like it's I don't
know it's a good thing or a bad thing
that the minute someone makes you feel
uncomfortable or don't think I'm being
treated the way I deserve I might steal
it oh it's really buy this like I'm
really not people I can be friends with
I don't need you in my life
oh you top three favorite youtubers I
made
yesterday about my favorite honestly my
favorite youtuber the one YouTube that I
watched all of her videos no matter what
it's jennamarbles jennamarblesvlog most
you tuber ever I love her podcast and
love Julian I love their vlogs like my
favorite youtubers because they
literally don't care about what people
think of them and they'll just start an
apartment unapologetically themselves I
love it my other favorite the one that I
always feel click on as well is Nicki
black cutter she's fantastic and always
kind of gets me motivated to do like
Fitness e stuff I love her personality
as well like she's so fun and easy to
watch no no I don't watch makeup
tutorials and beauty videos anymore so
bloggers are my thing so I guess yeah
let's say Jenna and then Nicki and then
Zoe is a big question I need to get my
teeth oh my god what's your opinion on
Logan pool after what he did
mm if I had his name in the title of
this video get instantly demonetized
wouldn't know so I have to be my careful
about what I title this I've listened to
Jenna and Julian's podcast so miss Jenna
said that it's almost like Logan and
Jake have kind of forgotten how to be
human beings and that's literally the
nail on the head about it all for me
like I I think there's no Humanity in
filming a dead body hosing in front of
someone that's committed suicide in a
forest for your thumbnail there's
something not quite right if you think
that's okay there's no going back
I've seen things I can't unsee
a dead body
five craziest things the attitude
afterwards of the obvious damage control
that he was in where he as a person
thinks it's okay to kind of mock suicide
and laugh about suicide and use suicide
the views that's him he is and that's
his core you can't change that within
like a month of damage control just
feels very uneducated about it and as
you know mental health is a very very
very big strong topic for me so when
that will happen it really upset me have
really affected me and for someone
that's kind of been in a very dark place
when it comes to stuff like suicide and
to see just the way it was handled it
was disgusting for me to see that stuff
I don't want to get too like angry and
emotional about this because it's
something that is a lot deeper for me
than it might seem on the surface that
self can be very triggering for some
people like it's for me and it's just
not very nice to see it represented in
such a disgusting way I just think the
fact that he had to stand there and get
someone to take photo him with a dead
body I don't understand it since then
his damage control what I mean by that
is that all that happens obviously his
management or everybody is above him and
gives him advice about stuff literally
obviously freaked out because of all the
backlash that he was getting so
everything that Logan did in response
was probably his manager telling him
what to do and he did that video
afterwards on suicide awareness now
anything which is for suicide awareness
mental health awareness you know it's a
good thing but it just didn't come from
a genuine place for me I watched the
whole video and I thought this just
seems like an actor reading a script I
don't understand like it's not him he's
acting any is an actor and like you've
seen from his content that he's posted
since that suicide awareness video he's
back to being a little like annoying
self so that whole like suicide
awareness video good intention very good
attention and probably very powerful for
other people watching it but for me very
weird to watch that and think this is
just strange it's just not coming from a
good place it's coming from a place of
please don't hate me anymore I'm doing
something good I don't know
I think people change in their aunt
you know in overtime we aren't really
seeing him change as a person so yeah I
think that's all I have to say I'm gonna
get really upset if I keep talking you
know that I came the next two questions
I knew I would get questions about this
so these two questions are super similar
I put them both on the screen for you
one of them says are you planning on
revealing who your boyfriend is in the
future do you want him to be partyi
vlogs in the long term does he like
keeping an influence so what's his
opinion on you're wearing make up such
creating this content the other one said
how did you and your wife roommate we
ever show up in your box or Instagram
we're looking forward to seeing be happy
couple we are adults in quite a serious
relationship so naturally I see him all
the time and he is such a massive master
my separa life so I mean how can I
explain this I don't want my job to have
to interfere with my personal life so
that's why I've chosen to kind of be
private a lot more private than I would
have been in the past about vlogs and as
you guys know about two and a bit years
ago I was in relationship and I showed
him a lot of my videos and since then I
private tires like all of them are
pretty sure but I feel like in this one
it's just it's different like this feels
like a very long-term thing and I don't
want anything to have to interfere with
it
so I'm just protecting myself and I'm
protecting him in a way and it's so sad
that I have to do that because 98% feel
like they're nice and sweet as people
that just want to see me half they want
to see him I know you're super
interested naturally there will be times
where you guys will see him in a
background of the video or you know in a
story or Instagram photo but I'm not
going to do anything like a boyfriend
her boyfriend does my makeup anything
like that because I'm not with him for
views I'm not with him I think there's a
career move I'm with him because I'm so
bloody happy with him no one has ever
made me feel like he does and he is
someone that's gonna be my life for a
long time I've had to learn through
mistakes in the past I get very excited
about things that sometimes I just over
share so I've had to learn to kind
take a step back at this time and I
think that kind of explains where I'm at
with it so I hope you guys understand
completely why I'm not doing like videos
with him and stuff I mean he and I going
to spend the next month together and
we're going to do by next month together
so if I blog or story or whatever like
you guys are gonna see him but I'm not
gonna like hide him nor am I going to
throw the camera in his face like if you
see him you see me if you don't you
don't it doesn't it doesn't mean
anything and it's just so weird doing my
job with my personal life have to kind
of like cross like this sometimes I'm
just protecting myself and my heart so
in terms of how we met and everything
like that yeah we met how very romantic
is it we were friends really require a
few months and then we just decided to
give it a go and then here we are very
happy I sort of make sense to you guys
like this is something which is very
special to me so I'm gonna be very
careful about what I say what I do what
I show just because sometimes it's nice
to have Danny's personal life and
Danny's work life separate because if
I'm constantly in work and I get people
for my personal life and I throw them
into my work I just get very clouded
with like what's work and what's the
meantime like I don't understand I
understand that I put myself out those
people wouldn't actually know what's
about me and that's completely normal to
want to know everything but yeah I'm
sure you guys will see in the future
bits and pieces but definitely not doing
my boyfriend videos if that makes sense
cuz I don't feel very comfortable at
Norwood he he's not someone that
particular ups at the camera so it like
one where away he's more than happy to
be behind the camera in helping me film
them being in front of it with me
vlogging us I think that will conclude
today's questions I'm a little bit
heated about the whole thing but um yeah
hope you guys understand
come from from everything like a bit of
a difficult one but anyway I always love
chatting to you guys and I will see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
