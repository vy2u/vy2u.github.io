today I am doing a questions and answer
video it's been forever since I did QA I
asked you guys to send me hash tag ask
Danny windspeed Wow do you send me
questions to answer today and I promise
I'm not gonna boy today I'm just gonna
get straight into it so the first
question is from Anastasio or Anastasia
and she says copy or take seriously if I
don't have my English breakfast tea in
the morning someone's a little bit
grumpy Mary is our standing what do you
think of your Instagram and Twitter fan
pages and Mary I know exactly who you
are I know that you run a lot of the fan
pages and honestly it makes me so happy
to see that there's people out there who
appreciate me enough to actually like
spend time editing photos of me and
south--and like putting little collages
together and it's so cute and I honestly
appreciate it so much
I follow every single like fan account
that I can find because I honestly think
they're just amazing what are your
thoughts on Lauren Curtis it's been a
general question honestly I think every
single girl especially a girl can admit
that Lauren Curtis was like the
introduction to the beauty world I think
that she's absolutely stunning she's
successful I'm not just gonna braid
around the bush here I know that I get
compared to Lauren a lot like every
single video someone's like oh my god
and you're trying to act like Lauren
Curtis I just think we have a similar
voice maybe like when people think we're
sisters it's like what no I wish I was
because she's like everything we should
just let people do their anything like
be there in person she is a great person
she's really successful and I'm hoping I
will meet her one day because she pretty
much was the reason why I started
YouTube people might be like you have
the same wha like is it everyone's
nervous laughter the same or am I just
crazy I think everyone's knows laughter
is quite similar to mine and yes we
might have a similar laugh we might have
a similar voice but we have to
blimpy different people unfortunately on
YouTube everything you say everything
you say get screwed nice I remember this
one time in tutorial I was like okay
guys so I'm not gonna do this guy on my
bottom lashes today's because I want to
keep it quite clean and fresh and then I
get a comment being like oh my god
you're throwing shade at Lauren and I'm
like it's like what pull this stuff from
it I have no hate for any youtuber I
honestly admire all of them because not
many people know how much hard work goes
on behind the scenes so I admire every
youtuber and I think that she's so
successful or she's so gorgeous and I
wish her all the best and I can't reach
me today where would you like to be in
five years and what would you like to
accomplish within that time frame
so I'm hoping by then I'll be engaged
but I hope that I will be able to use my
online exposure or whatever for speaking
in schools or helping people with
bullying and depression because it's one
thing I really want to do I really want
to help people and that's just something
I want to use my platform for but I
would love I have already waited five
years for one and I don't have one so
let's hope another five years I will
finally get one if you could do a collab
with someone else who would it be
now I think a lot of you already know
the answer to this if you've been
following my social media lately and
stuff like that I would probably want to
not just collab with Shyne XR but I find
that ever since watching your daily
vlogs we have so much in common it's
like what does similar health issues
know it's kind of weird and the same
kind of problem with our eyes and I like
how we get tired during the day like
weird so genuine it she's so
down-to-earth and she's just beautiful
she's absolutely beautiful and I can't
in my heart enough for the fact that in
her vlogs she is so confident just like
things with my makeup camera and I'm
like oh my god I wish I could do that
sorry in terms of collaboration I think
I think I'd be great friends with
Shannon in terms of youtubers like my
number one girl crush I think we all
know that desi Perkins my girl crush I
think I will just stare at her free to
be clever issue for 10 minutes how are
you so beautiful what are your thoughts
on plastic surgery and would you ever
consider getting anything these
questions are so general it's like cool
about my thoughts but surgery is if you
wanted you know self to improve your
confidence and other nerds just boost up
your self-esteem and you don't want to
put any other reason than yourself and
it's your decision and no one should
tell you otherwise if it gets to
extremes like you want to get like 35
double X boobs that will give you like
chronic back pain and it's a little bit
like maybe Ricky's yeah people that get
like lip fillers botox whatever like I
honestly think it's their decision and
unfortunately with plastic surgery it
doesn't always go the right way so it's
a risk you have to take in case it goes
wrong you don't end up a duck lips and
all this kind of stuff I've never had
plastic surgery I've always had thoughts
of plastic surgery I'm a girl I've grown
up in this world but it's at least the
reefs are just like photoshopped and
beautiful and massive boobs and guys
going crazy over the blonde hair the
group skills I just think at the end of
the day and this is how I've been
created to look and I should just
embrace that and accept it and if
someone doesn't like it they can have a
medal for their opinion but I do not
care if you think I'm unattractive or
ugly because that is not much
how it went a little bit dick fun didn't
it Sammy says have you figured out a fan
name for us this is something that I
really want to like really wanna get it
done get done to do I guess I should
just take is come up with a name for all
my friends which mean you guys so much
with fans to ease them like that is so
good but I hate that word fan like I
just hate hate like calling subscribers
fans actually a girl I went to school
with recommended fam cooties so like my
family City what do you guys think do
you like
I think that's freaky so thank you guys
for watching all the way through I hope
that you enjoyed this QA I will always
do a Q&amp;amp;A is through Twitter so just use
the hashtag a semi sweet so I hope you
guys have a brilliant week I love you
loads and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
