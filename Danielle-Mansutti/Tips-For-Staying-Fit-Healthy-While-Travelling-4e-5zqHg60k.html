in today's video I am showing you how to
stay fit and healthy thing goes where
while traveling keeping a conscious mind
of making an effort to safe and healthy
while I'm traveling as many of you know
I have been traveling a lot recently and
it is very very very easy to fall into
the sort of lazy travel life with no
exercise and eating junk food I wanted
to show you how I stay fit and healthy
in New York and I hope you guys enjoy
let's jump into it
the best tip for staying active when
you're traveling is to walk anywhere and
everywhere
as long as you feel safe walk as much as
you can and by walking everywhere you
are exploring more and seeing more and
getting more out of the country that
you're visiting a super important tip is
to buy food for your hotel room to
resist things like room service or fast
food it's so easy to find a grocery
store that you can just buy some fresh
fruit and veggies out and just leave
them in your room like in your bar fruit
and use it just for snacking in the
hotel room or throw it in your bag when
you're exploring during the day
I picked up a whole bunch of Kiwis
strawberries and berries I got a bunch
of bananas I got some gluten-free
cookies because I believe in a balanced
diet I got a whole bunch of strawberries
celery sticks Kakuma sticks carrot
sticks
this massive salad that I'm going to eat
now which I got from the little
pick-and-mix salad bar and I also got
two bars a protein bar and a fruit and
nut bar all of this food was under $30
in total and that's going to last me the
whole week as well went out and I found
a place that did some fruit and I've
also grabbed some fruit and nut bars
I've fallen in love with this brand
they're so yummy but I'm definitely not
saying that you have to eat like a
rabbit all the time if you want to eat
meat to new york 8p2 new york as long as
it's in moderation and a small size who
cares just enjoy it
it is my last day today I just went and
I got some snacks even they're having a
cheat day si was awesome it's good to be
eating healthy again today so what I
picked up is from pret and I got some
water I also got a chicken salad picked
up some more of those like nut bars and
I got strawberries yo so excited to be
eating healthy again I never thought I'd
say that before always take the stairs
guys your body will love you for it
and finally always make healthy menu
choices it's a lot easier than you think
thank you so much to everyone for
watching this video I appreciate so much
and I hope that it was a little bit
informative one thing I didn't add is
drink water oh my goodness you need to
drink water when you're traveling
especially when you get off the plane
just so dehydrated so don't forget to
drink you a boarder I'll see you guys
very soon I love you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
