today I've created a tutorial using the
Too Faced love palette now this palette
is the new full autumn 2015 collection I
believe so credit look good yeah I know
so credit a golden smokey eye look at
using Elise from the palette and I
really hope that you guys enjoy this
tutorial and let's jump straight into it
adding with this guy called a door I'm
using it as my transition shade above my
crease
and now I'm just gonna pop desire on my
crease but I'm not going as far up as I
did with a door
taking a door once again I'm just gonna
pack this all over my lids
and I using this gorgeous show called
amorous I'm gonna use this in my outer
corner and punch it up a little bit to
my crease as well just to darken up the
sides and then going in with a blending
brush and blending it through I also
decided to use a pencil brush to apply
this just to darken it up even more and
make it a little bit more defined
not using the pretty shade called
cherish I'm using this as an under ira
highlight
and then I'm just gonna take a q-tip and
wipe off all the smudges from underneath
my eyes is to clean it up a little bit
before applying some eyeliner I'm just
using your liquid eyeliner and I'm gonna
follow the line which I've mapped out
with the q-tip and just make a little
wing now using my favorite better than
sex mascara I'm just gonna apply a coat
on my lashes before applying falsies and
I'm using my car eyelashes in full 15
and I'm just gonna pop those on there
really natural but they're really long I
love them using amorous once again I'm
gonna use this on my lower lash line so
I'm just going to shade that through
with a pencil brush and I'm making sure
to smoke it out a little bit as well
just for a really cool effect
and then I'm meeting that shade in the
middle with a door once again and just
dragging that through the middle part of
my lower lashline
and finally taking cherish once again
I'm gonna put this on my inner corner
for a bit of a highlight
and for a bit more of a smokey effect I
was going in with a black pencil
eyeliner and putting this on my
waterline just to smoke it up and then
finally I'm going to apply a coat of
mascara to my bottom lashes and finish
off the look
so I hope that you guys enjoyed this
tutorial today thank you so much for
watching as always and I'll see you
really soon
