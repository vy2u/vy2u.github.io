my mozzie pants are looking bad I
happened on the underside of my foot
like hello I've just finished filming my
lookbook I really hurt it looks really
cool once it's all together I tried
really hard to think of like what would
be good shots and her kind of stuff so
that should be able to 23rd of February
so hope you guys are excited to see the
lookbook so for the rest of the day I'm
gonna be editing ice to my emails I have
to work still I think you might go and
get lunch or afternoon tea or something
and then we're gonna go to the so I get
message depending on how much work I
have I'm either going to go into a vide
with mum or stay here and work
now I'm gonna go and head off to the spa
and get my massage
ah okay so I just had my massage and
that was insane that was so nice and now
I'm just like so pissed out and happy it
was amazing it was an hour massage and
then afterwards they just let you have a
shower like one of your favorite scents
and one thing I really noticed about the
people of barley is that all of them are
so kind so lovely and so friendly the
nicest people you'll ever come across
seriously and the experience at the uber
resorts being incredible I have a
question for you guys I was thinking
about this during the massage because
you guys know that I love traveling and
I thrive of traveling where is your
favorite place you have ever traveled to
and what do you want to travel to
because obviously I want to travel more
and that kind of stuff so please let me
know in the comments where you want to
go and where your favorite place was so
mom and I are just going to get room
service to not have a really chilled one
I brought Eat Pray Love as well so we're
going to watch that how cute and
tomorrow's Valentine's Day so I'm gonna
go you back to 7:00 yet tomorrow and
we're gonna say who I believe it's cold
should be fun and I'm so excited to get
ready we've had to call for backup
wizard update and it's now hiding and it
keeps making a noise going oh the lizard
man came to capture and disappeared
so he's been waiting side ages it's not
gonna be okay
we've now been moved into a second herd
all will be explained in the morning
what did your mother night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
