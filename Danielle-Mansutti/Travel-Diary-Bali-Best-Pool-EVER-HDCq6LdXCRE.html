everyone welcome to day two of my little
barley troubles it's raining right now
again but we really wanted to do some
cool apps and photos you have to wait a
little bit but there's a bride who's
here now getting her photos turn so I
don't want to like these settings are
annoying a photo shoot or anything today
I'm wearing this really bitty clap from
show PO so this little maxi skirt and
this crop top are Sherpa and then later
on today I think we're going to see the
bulb of cafe I believe it's cool
revolving of you guys who are wondering
about calm we the one I'm doing an old
stuff I decided to bring my mother
dearest because she deserves it more
than anyone else to have a little bit of
a holiday she's been doing a lot of me
lately so I thought and then we are
going to be travelling around Bali we're
going to be going to do bud or you bud I
don't really know how to say it I'm
going there tomorrow and then we're also
going to go back to seminyak so we're
just sort of like all around the place I
was super tired in yesterday's vlog so
today's vlog hopefully wants the rain
goes away would be a bit more bit more
upbeat so we'll see how it goes
and it's like really fabulous right now
my ears on we went out in the rain and
we decided to take the photos anyway so
I will show you what we got we did this
and it looks oh god damn Posie donut so
mom and I are just about to head out to
get something for lunch or something to
eat
we're going to go to a place called
revolver is espresso this is an expresso
see what's there maybe get so much for
something like that I'm really excited
to go because it seems that every other
blogger that's ever gone always goes to
this cafe so I want to see what all the
hypes about as you guys have probably
seen my camera keeps for hogging up to
the humidity it don't lamps a little
fast don't they know how to stop that
pretty dumb
finished up at revolver when I was gonna
go look at shop thanks to mums on the
hunt for a clip of the flower in it so
she's made one herself she's got her
little kid but she found a flower on the
floor
DIY hey guys your shoes are nice grey so
I just had the sweetest subscriber come
over and say hi my first subscriber in
Bali she was absolutely caters but I
asked trying to be in the blog but
unfortunately she said she to shine at
something folks I'd be exactly same to
be she said she's been following me like
until the days where you can go on about
the weekend and that's what she's like I
used to tell my friends that I found a
song but I actually found out yes so
thank you so much for saying hi you
actually made my day so cool that people
know who I am here it's really severe we
are back from lunch now and we are going
to go for a swim in the pool we haven't
been in the pool yet so it'll be good to
finally get a little bit of swimming in
there because it's not been sunny so
we've kind of been like avoiding you a
little bit but oh well it's stopping now
summers or go
okay the pool water is absolutely
beautiful it's like a perfect
temperature
refreshing so nine so so far we are
absolutely loving the hotel love and
cool and everyone has been so lovely and
so kind to us and just being like
honestly under their service but we've
an amazing time and tomorrow we go to do
blood orgy but and we're very excited
about that I have no idea what to expect
there so we just got drinks and I just
spilt my knowledge myself not even
thought and drinking yet this drink is
honestly like death sure sure
one sip and I'm like partay if I'm not
heading up did an hour all matchy-matchy
we are going to find somewhere to eat
Oh
in this shop and we couldn't be dressed
more like the things which are typically
drive we're now walking back to our
hotel down this very scary alleyway this
is really a month taking me I'm being
attacked by mosquitos as always I need
to get back and my trick is to use
roll-on deodorant on the bias because it
helps so much but do anything know what
attracts a mosquito to a person because
mosquitoes love me and I don't know why
there's either a little puppy or a big
cat over there cut oh my god what was
that
mum did say she thought it was a statue
though oh it moved
back here again I said that we're gonna
have to say goodbye to this place
tomorrow once we're inside I'm going to
grab all my SD card and start etching
this blog so have you guys enjoyed they
to a body travel with Danny and then I
was here you guys tomorrow when we go to
do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
