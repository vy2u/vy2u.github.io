good morning everyone and welcome to a
different room in the same place so last
night was a little bit dramatic we're in
our room and we kept hearing these
really weird noises and we called
housekeeping down and we had a monitor
lizard in our room so we had to change
rooms and they've actually put us in
like an amazing family villa so pretty
this place we didn't even realize like
it's huge because we came here in the
dark last night we didn't see anything
so our little twin beds here and then
outside so beautiful and the sun is
shining today well I haven't seen that
in a long time we have a little kitchen
little lounge area and then outside it's
really cute actually we actually think
this is very cozy so you've got like a
little dining place over there the pool
sunbirds
another little daybed there and then in
here is another bedroom today we're
going back to seminyak and we're going
to stay I believe it's called the who
villas who and then I really want to go
and check out cafe Organic and I really
want to go and check out potato head
before we leave because we leave in two
days late is Valentine's Day might be
super busy at potato head I'm not too
sure yet we'll have to wait and see so
we're gonna go and get the transfer now
very soon I'll talk about an hour or so
to seminyak and I have to edit
yesterday's vlog on that transfer
because of the dramatic Moodle event
last night and have time to edit it so
those of you that are asking why am i
barley and what am I doing here - what
kind of stuff the reason why I'm here
it's a working holiday and we only had
six days here so we haven't really had
the opportunity yet to go like fully
exploring into Bali
it would've been amazing to do that and
I'll definitely come back and do that
one day I'm working pleasure trip but
it's it's been really cool and it's gone
really fast this is how I feel about
Valentine's Day
Oh
me
you
you
you
what I do
me
you say
say we have intellect I'm searching for
with your whatever
we arrived it's so beautiful here is as
always I'm doing the rune - before we
unpack here is our little outdoor or not
little it's huge outdoor section is blue
skies we have very modern Villa very
very very modern so we've got a little
kitchen and we have the toilet and we
have two things we have this cute bar
and the showers here let's go upstairs
this chandelier whoa here's the
beautiful bedroom so beautiful home we
have a little welcome drinks as well how
cute
so moment I was just saying that we are
so glad that we've gone to such a
different variety of villas and hotels
and stuff like that just to see all the
different things that barley offers for
accommodation this is so modern and so
stunning it's just like wow so mum has
just been chewed back and she brought me
some ice cream
I don't had eyes for me I'm assuming
that's a mango that's mm-hmm we
are now going to venture out to potato
head but as it's Valentine's Day there
is a huge chance it would be absolutely
packed and it's a hot day so we'll see
how we go but we're gonna head there and
hopefully see what happens but tomorrow
we're going to go to Cafe Organic
because we totally didn't realize it
close to 4:00 and we wanted to go at
like 4:00 through like oh maybe tomorrow
maybe I have some work to do tonight and
then tomorrow is my last day in Bali I
can never work these doors out also
today I want the Garnier BB cream which
I used to rave about so much I like have
my old tube from so long ago and I
brought it with me
I'm actually really like pleasantly
surprised that it looks like my skin and
it lasted me long as well I know it's
not this one set I'm just saying guys
like I really was impressed with it I
haven't worn it in a long time so I
forgot how it wasn't my skin but yeah
it's a little bit shiny now I guess but
we did a good job title vlog inception
right now because I'm finishing the vlog
up to this point I got saved by so
goodnight I hope you enjoyed and I
looking forward to the last
bollingsworth tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
