to my sixth meeting that I've had in LA
so far and tonight is many M Patrick's
one-million party and pretty sure a lot
of youtubers that I watch you're going
to be there it's gonna be a whole bunch
of really important people there so I'm
a little bit scared let me just turn off
the TV eggs it might be a little bit
loud when you last saw my vlogs I had
pretty much just arrived in LA so far
now I have had five meetings and it's
been insane it has been snot opening and
so amazing meeting so many important
people here everything here is so
fast-paced and I'm absolutely in love
with LA like I love it so much today I
am meeting with a cosmetics company and
that's my really exciting we're gonna go
to stir which is like awesome because
I've been watching Vanderpump rules
mostly Lisa like yes and then I'm gonna
come back I'm gonna do a really dramatic
smoky eye I think and then I'm heading
off to Mary and Patrick so a million
party later it is unfortunate that I
couldn't vlog the last two days because
everything is quite confidential with my
cut blog in business meetings but some
exciting stuff is hopefully gonna happen
very soon and I'm probably gonna be in
LA a lot in the next year or so like
coming back and forth
I love the u.s. so much and I love your
food way too much like it's dangerous
I'm gonna go downstairs and get picked
up for my next meeting

back in the hotel and getting ready for
the party tonight I'm so excited to meet
everyone I'm just like yay

time before the event if you're not

too nervous and shy around people like
Jacqueline Hill I wanted say hi but I
know I was gonna be staring at her and
said being like you'll have no idea who
I am but hello today's meetings went

own friends that can currently see I'm

they would not be where they are today
without the support of everyone here the
grant 5 to choose a friend to the other
influencers I've supporting them through
every single journey that they have
started and are continuing to grow this
is 1 million but I'm sure student will
