nice to breed for something louder come
along and say
Oh
and here is home for the next seven days
very little very cute and it's my beer
all the essentials got my big TV my big
bed my big shower
I've now unpacked my stuff and made
myself at home
I've ordered room service and it's time
for a nap
how beautiful does it look so now I'm
just sitting here watching Sex in the
City so chilled out oh it's got a Whole
Foods let's get some nice fruit and
stuff
okay so what have we got
I actually bought healthy today the
first time everyone holiday I'm not
really holiday but oh I'm proud of
myself we have got some bananas I also
got some grapes I had to just get stuff
that I could leave in the hotel because
I don't even think that there's a fridge
here
and then I have a protein shake for
tomorrow morning after I do my workout I
have so many mandarins but I couldn't
find anything smaller
so whoops then I have some granola bars
for the morning finally because I
believe in a balanced diet I also got
some of these I've never had before they
are doughnut holes which is super
interesting because we don't have that
in Australia so I'm guessing that's the
inside of a doughnut that they throw out
that is my little shopping haul that's
going to be staying in the hotel I'm
here to snack on and stuff instead of
chocolate who have I become seriously
but now it is getting to the evening and
look how beautiful this windows a bit
dirty though isn't it oh I'm pretty sure
I saw the Hollywood sign before as well
Oh was I just saying things I might have
just been seeing things
come on zoom do your thing do your thing
yeah there it is
so this room who sold is having a
Hollywood view but you know if I stand
here you kind of like wait where'd way
to go good morning everyone it is now my
second day in LA I landed yesterday but
I was so tired that I hardly got around
to booking so I landed around 6:30 a.m.
got into la about 8:30 had the best nap
ever I swear to God my bed is the
company's thing ever is more comfortable
and then I went out shopping and I got
so much stuff the shopping here is
amazing and then I went to Target which
is so weird saying like I went grocery
shopping at Target because in Australia
that does not happen it realize how low
the TV was as well I'm sorry but we're
gonna go to earth cafe and then we might
be going to Venice Beach which would be
super exciting because summer I didn't
see last time but I'm gonna take you
guys along with me and see what we get
up to now time to go I have the room
which is like the farthest away from the
elevator text me like a good ten minutes
just to look here so funny
and we're still going
getting hit on over to seconds i with my
friend Lauren where it doesn't say to
look around but to find all the crazies
let's have some good fun
Jesus
saved-up focus
breathe we love Dennis being straight oh
there's this one guy I got should I
caught it he went like 360 but his arm
fries because I'm being really healthy
today try shirring so you know how I
told you guys that I'm eating healthy in
the u.s. that literally loves Detroit
boy
someone's who
down koco's hey everyone and back in my
hotel room now it's such a nice day with
Lauren sorry I didn't vlog enough but I
just want to keep firing the camera in
her face because we just really wanted
to spend the day together and have girl
time and everything so I have a story
time from today oh my goodness
so at cafe this morning there was this
old man who wouldn't leave me alone and
when I walked in he just said something
like oh look at your eyes and I was like
well thank you that's really kind but
then he just stayed there and was
staring at me I wouldn't leave and I was
like yeah but you guys know what I mean
it was like that all sort of 65 year old
creepy kind of vibe and I'm like mm-hmm
just gonna order my food right now by
myself and I like texting my friend I'm
like Lauren hurry up or my going my god
before she got there I sat down table
and this man followed me in his set at
the table with me and I just like also
I'm waiting for a friend and he's like
where are you from where are you staying
what's your hotel what's your room
number what's this what's that and I'm
like so uncomfortable and I'm just
sitting there like um yep yep yep my
friends coming good I'm psyched please
leave me alone and then as my friend
came he was like well I want to take you
out sometime and did it I'm thinking god
you'll like my granddad can you leave me
alone then when he left I just laughed
and I'm like it's just LA isn't it it's
just a completely different world here
and it's so funny everyone comes up to
you and everyone approaches you and
everyone says really weird stuff and
you're like it's just LA that's just the
way it is yeah I'm gonna chill for a bit
it's now 6 p.m. I'm feeling very tired
yet like I said it hit me but I kind of
feel like I need to go into a workout I
haven't done one yet and I feel like I
have to because I'm going away somewhere
amazing next month and I need to step up
my body because I've been very lazy
lately so yeah we'll see if I could be
bothered having a workout and then maybe
later on depending how tired I am I
might be going out for some drinks and
stuff with Lauren and a few of her guy
friends from work there's lots of
exciting stuff happening while I'm here
I'm going to be collaborating with a few
different youtubers I have so many
meetings to go to sir in terms of
vlogging I will vlog whatever something
interesting happens I'm not
logging I can't promise anything like
that because a lot of the days will be
super boring me sitting in a meeting
room the whole day so yeah we'll see how
we go I'm so happy being back in the
u.s. I love it here if you guys can
recommend anywhere that you think I
should go or check out and please let me
know and I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
