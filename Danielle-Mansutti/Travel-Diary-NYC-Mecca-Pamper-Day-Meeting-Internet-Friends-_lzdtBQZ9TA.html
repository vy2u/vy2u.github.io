hello everyone it is Saturday today over
the last week or so I haven't really had
any sleep at all pretty much every
single night I got 2 to 4 hours sleep
because my jetlag was just so bad and I
was up working all night most night or
getting up at like 4:00 a.m. to work and
edit and emails and do postings for
brands and all kind of stuff so anyway
last night I was like you know what I'm
gonna have a sleeping tablet I'm gonna
knock out a key just leave like I can
finally see if you're gonna haven't
slept in 6 days probably so I had a
sleeping tablet and it knocked me out so
hard that I couldn't wake up and then
this whole day I felt so fuzzy
infinitely so I've been not doing that
sleeping tablet trick ever again so this
morning I went for a little wander
around and it's some shopping and now
