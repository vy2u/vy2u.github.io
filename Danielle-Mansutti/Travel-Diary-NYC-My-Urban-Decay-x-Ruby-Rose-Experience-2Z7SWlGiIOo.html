is my little room and let's see the few
very very very new yorky maybe I should
have more light so we will see it better
so it's 9 p.m. right now I think umm so
I should probably try and get some sleep
as soon as I can
oh my god looks like either disco going
on over there oh I'm pretty sure I make
a scene nice dance workplace as well I'm
pretty sure I saw a lot of things I
recognize from his vlogs that be super
interesting good morning everyone it is
my first morning in New York so I
arrived last night at 10 p.m. and now it
is 10 a.m. I have three or four meetings
today and then I have an Urban Decay
dinner tonight I really don't know how
I'm gonna last because I didn't sleep
like at all last night my jetlag was so
bad and I'm pretty tired so we'll see
how the day goes
so the reason why I met in New York is
because urban decay has an event going
on and mecha cosmetic has sent me over
and I'm super excited oh wait this
week's gonna be full of amazing things
and meeting amazing people and Wow New
York beautiful I haven't even been able
to look outside properly yet but here's
my view in the morning very New York and
it's raining right now I don't have an
umbrella
unfortunately so don't I know what I'm
gonna do but I have to head out from
about half an hour and go to my first
meeting exciting times
yum I got my salad from Whole Foods I
cook tuna noodles cucumber tomato love
it I've got about three hours until the
dinner so I need to shave my legs do my
time do you mind get fully ready and
everything but also eat my salad all
right I'm now Glenda and I'm late
this time to one of the mecha goes
downstairs and we're gonna hit
thank you for coming I'm excited about
the lunch advice I hope you guys love
the lipsticks as much as I have fun
creating them and here's to a fun thing
tomorrow
now one I am I don't know how I'm still
like I'm so tired so we just finished
the Urban Decay dinner I didn't vlog too
much because I didn't want to stick
cameras in people's faces but everyone
was there ok back to the story
yes Samantha was there from Canada I
didn't get to say hi to expose too shy
Geoffrey star was just casually sitting
opens at me Maddie was there Patrick was
there
Kristen Dominique was there I just saw
desi Perkins and left of Katie running
around in the hotel a bunch of people
here my shyness got the better of me
today and I'm sure it's also because I'm
jet-lagged but I was just like staring
at everyone I was just like too
intimidated to talk to anyone if that
makes any sense it's like I was having
one of those moments where I'd go up and
talk to someone but then I have a brain
fart I wouldn't actually know what to
say so I both happen to be like hi I
can't read what I was gonna say I'm
never going to work on guys Malati is
social anxiety Hey always thinking
people think the worse to me when
they're probably just not thinking about
you at all anyway this is what my phone
was ringing I have a delivery that must
have Urban Decay lipstick thing I showed
you guys um it's right here there are a
hundred lipsticks in here 100 lipsticks
here we have got it's like a little
cookie a little more yeah that's so
beautiful
I think this should be a little pod dude
Danny thank you so much for joining us
in New York to celebrate the launch of
vice lipstick with Ruby Rose with your
help we're going to make this the
biggest launch yet here are a few vices
to get you started
I've been decay guys here
that is a lot look at all the shades can
we just
oh wow hello everyone
so I just quickly got ready this whole
time I've been here everything's been so
rushed I'm sorry that haven't had a
chance to stop and talk to you guys I'm
already late to heading downstairs oh my
god
got to be quick so I have done a very
sort of darkish makeup look I'm wearing
the lunar lashes by Danny you store I
spy lashes yes love them now we're
heading off to the Urban Decay press
event with reviewers and I'm we're gonna
meet reviewers which is crazy and then
afterwards is the urban decay
after-party which should be awesome so
yeah let's go
and let's give it up to one day I
realized week was really this moment of
self-expression for us for me I it
wasn't about covering flaws it's really
about telling the world who I was and it
was when I was at church I'm having my
full makeup on and I was about 16 and
this priest walked up to me and said you
know you're really hiding behind that
mask at makeup and I thought to myself
no I'm not I'm telling you who I am I'm
telling you something about myself now
I'm fishing a little bit I would love to
know why you decided to work with us
well it's not a survey secondly you know
same same reasons because decay is such
a cutting edge cool makeup line that
really promotes individuality
hello everyone I'm now back from the
Urban Decay event I'm very tired
everyone that you could ever think of
was there desi
wrote something really lovely on my
photo last night I opened up about being
shy and you know it's gonna be really
real with you guys so I thank to have
been leaving such a lovely comment to me
today when tonight was really cool and
Wendy who was the CCO of every decay is
such a lovely person as well she's so
nice and so welcoming
why not to Ruby and it's so funny cause
I was so anxious I wanted to say to her
a very simple sentence I wanted to go up
to her because I knew that she was super
busy and she's taking photo after photo
to photo and her face just like I'm like
so from smiling kind of face and I
wanted to say to her hey Ruby I am a
Melburnian - meaning I'm from Melbourne
- of course I tripped over every single
word in that sentence I went up to her
and I was like hi I'm Mel but she's like
are you okay tomorrow I'm having a photo
shoot with urban decay which is so
exciting I'm getting my hair done and my
makeup done and fun fact I've never had
my makeup done before by someone else
though it should be really exciting I've
never had my hair look this cool before
it's like a little Victoria Secret wave
I love it so much and the funniest thing
when I was getting my hair done
I just asked could I possibly get like a
Victoria's Secret curly wave and then my
hair just casually drops oh yeah I do
the Victoria's Secret hair I'm like wait
why she's like yeah I'm a hair stylist
and I'm like oh so you know what you're
doing so obviously she knows what she's
doing I love my hair it's so cool now
we're heading off to Urban Decay for a
shoot but they look look and I'm super
excited so now it's time to head off to
Brooklyn
but she was such a fun experience it was
so just like oh I didn't know how to
part it was just like would await turb I
get my hates direction they were really
really really really really love with me
and I'm super excited to see the photos
Matt on the way back cause like she went
get some pizza and I'm pretty sure the
pizza place that we went to is around
the corner from Casey and nine-step I'm
pretty sure I have seen it in a blog
