channel today I have such an exciting
video I'm doing fashion triumphal
secretly like my favorite videos ever to
film I love fashion videos I love what
books we take because they have the
world's best customer service and the
world's best stock they are incredible I
can't to show you the stuff I picked
from my website today I love that stuff
so much and it is a little bit more into
base um I have explained you guys now
like 5000 times it's winter in Australia
a hemisphere is a confusing a lot of
people but it's winter now in Australia
so this first thing I'm going to share
with you all is this beautiful kite and
you're gonna see it a lot better when I
watch you wearing it because so this is
lasting study style okay this is the
kind of stuff but I need to start
wearing a bit more oh but a bit less
okay we'll get there eventually this is
such a beautiful coat it is so warm it
has a cute little buttons on the side as
well and it's just got a button in the
middle and it kind of like comes out a
little bit but it feels so well made and
so so so so soft and beautiful
it's the perfect warm classy coat for
winter and I absolutely adore the color
next I have this little knit it's such a
perfect comfy casual little knit to wear
in winter and I am loving all this kind
of style with this kind of rolled neck
at the moment I love it and it's really
in Australia right now the material for
this one it is a little bit thinner so
you'll be good to wear with a coat over
the top and I think it goes so well with
like black pants or black jeans or black
leggings and like a little ankle boot or
something it looks so gorgeous you guys
may have noticed that I hardly ever like
wear this kind of color I know aside
from Greg as I feel like washes me out a
little bit I like this color it's
a cooler gray it's a lot
right and yep the next piece that I
chose is this pipe which is like way to
infer camera this is probably the
thickest warm as nicest class mr. kite I
own this is beautiful and tired up from
the back is all kind of like a little
interesting yeah and I love it because
it because no matter what you're wearing
it can put this on over the top and look
so I love that about this it's so much
warmer and looks so much nicer than
wearing like a hoodie or a zip up or
something so I have been absolutely
loving this style do you wish it had
like a button or something at the front
that it's just an open front which is
fine it's still beautiful that way but
it's good that you can tie it up from
the back so this is like the warmest
nicest thing ever guys I believe on the
website I have heaps of different colors
of this style but I chose black because
I love black but as you can see um I
have dog hair sitting all over it
because um if your night black put it
back on the rack but and my dog just
like herself all over my clothes so
it's like oh so believe it or not but
before this I didn't actually own it so
I thought it was about time that I went
got one this is in an extra small but my
god it is such a good size it's so much
warmer than I thought it would be I
didn't think that dinner would make in
that warm because it always feels quite
cold but this is it absolutely perfect
denim jacket I've been looking for just
a normal basic down Jack without any
sort of like extra features on it for so
long and I have been loving this work so
old black pants or black jeans just like
the other top from before the next thing
I'd like to share with you guys is this
dress it's like a long long sleeved
t-shirt dress is the what I would
describe it so if you've been following
me on Instagram for a while or anything
like that you would know that this is
like screams Danny this is like my kind
of style I love anything which is like
black and long and you went big chunky
boots with it or something
or just dress it up with like golden
accessories or something and I'm loving
this is long sleeve as well because I
don't really aren't any dresses which
are long sleeve or like quite short
sleeve all the straps and this is so
perfect for the season waiting right now
and it's perfect to wear with like many
tights like knitted tights underneath a
scarf and a nice just picture in my head
once again please ignore my ugly coat
hanger for Marks and Spencers this is
something which I have been searching
for for so long just a nude singlet
which isn't as nude as I am so you don't
mean it's like one shade lighter than I
am and therefore you don't get like
crazy contrast I really really really
really like this one it's a perfect
thing that I absolutely love the color
and I love the fact that I don't own
anything else in my entire water which
is color so as you guys may not know I'm
actually wearing the beat jeans that I
know that to show you can't really hold
them up because they're sort of like
right there
and I'm wearing ugg boots well that was
really embarrassing to be completely
honest with you when I first saw these
pants I thought I'm gonna have to suck
myself in to get into these pants I put
them on I was like these are the compass
things I've ever worn in my life okay
they are almost comfier than leggings
seriously on the same level of comfort
as leggings but they're not liking is
that classier maybe oh my god here's the
Fox do you mean without making it tie in
you know how sometimes you wear skinny
jeans but you like who is feel like
you're losing the circulation in your
legs because they're so tight these are
not tight they stretch to your legs it's
not tight up at the top it fits that it
won't sit down but it doesn't hurt at
all to wear them if you are a seller
Shannon Harris
fan as I am you would have seen this
before in the past
Shannon absolutely iron for this t-shirt
dress okay she's worn in a few videos
and I'm every single time she wore it I
was just like she looks so beautiful in
that tincture dress even though I don't
look as
chittering it I thought I'd pick it up
because I thought she looked so
beautiful whenever she wore this and I'm
absolutely loving this style I love
casual comfy basic clothes I am that the
definition of boring okay I know that so
this kind of stuff is like my
personality so boring t-shirt dress is
boring basic stuff I don't really like
anything that has a design a pattern of
print I like as basic as you can get and
the thing is I find that basics are
actually the hardest thing to find when
you shop because building everything has
a print on it or a style on it and just
to get a basic white t-shirt dress like
this with a cool little box and slaves
on the side to me is a crazy fun I love
it
my next piece to show you is probably my
second favorite from the whole reign so
when I was looking online and whatfox
boutique I actually was looking with
Michael because we're picking them
together and we both looked at this and
we thought a hundred percent that is me
so this t-shirt dress is the best fabric
it is so flowy and soft and it just
feels so nice and it's just the most
perfectly aware with the boots I love it
and finally for clothes we have this bad
boy here this is a knit that I have been
living in for like a week straight okay
I have been wearing this so often and
I've had a lot of lovely people ask you
where it's from this is a hundred
percent my favorite thing from
everything that I picked this is a nice
perfect comfy warm jump and I are and
I've just never earned anything like
this style before and it's so warm and
beautiful and I just need to wear
something else
every wearing this black guys in the
road because I love it so much and I
really hope they get some more colors in
this again because this style is just
the best thing I've ever had my hands on
in my life as many of you probably know
and whitefox petite stop ki Australia
settings and Kate is really starting
smoking the most beautiful thing in the
whole world probably
in the hollow to be hands-on so I'm
gonna go and orders my least favorite -
my favorite I love them all but I do
have a favorite so the first ones that
I'll show you of these ones and these
are called about last night and about
last night are a little bit too big for
my face because I have a square face
they don't suit me that well but they
are pretty gorgeous
my second favorite style are the Frankie
glasses these glasses are so cool this
might be like Willy Wonka or something I
think that they're really cool for my
face shape as well they might look a bit
nude but I really like them I think
they're cool and again I think all this
one is look really cool from my side cuz
I love how little gets thinner to pick
up okay
here is my ultimate ultimate favorite
kiss really science these are my go
reason my go Sonny I absolutely love the
shape the glasses they have my favorite
style and I love the reflective stuff
and they little cat is going on as well
I think that's like cute and original
unique and funky if you could tell me
which ones for your parrot my needs as
oh that would help me out because I do
have quite a square size a big face wish
I had a very petite tube behind long
face endurance so the really big square
glasses look a bit a little bit on me
but if you could tell me your favourites
that would be amazing
thank you guys so much for watching my
fashion video I so much fun filming it I
hope you have a brilliant wait let me
know what you think about me doing
fashion videos because I'm sick I will
