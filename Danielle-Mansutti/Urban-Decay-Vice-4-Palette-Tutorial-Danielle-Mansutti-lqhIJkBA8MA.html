decay of Vitus pallets to a very
colorful pink orange kind of eye I love
the packaging we're starting with bitter
from the palette and we're just going to
apply this to our crease just use a big
fluffy brush and go back and forth like
forth and a little bit more back and
forth and you can't know it until it's
completely blended out and there's no
harsh lines anywhere
now I'm taking flame which is incredible
and I'm using a flat brush to apply this
directly onto my lid and I'm patting it
on my lid not dragging it that is very
important
I'm not taking fastball and I'm going to
apply this on my lower lash line
I saw Nicki do this on his snapchat and
I was so inspired and I'm also using
flame on the outer corner and blending
it all together and then going back with
fastball I'm just using this on my inner
corners for a highlight and then
applying the Too Faced better than sex
mascara missing the Cara eyelashes in
number 415 is lashes it's so natural and
so gorgeous they're just perfect for
this look
now using Bahama Mama behind a bomb I'm
going to use this on my cheeks and my
temples and also underneath my chin for
a little bit of a contour without using
a contour kit and then I'm going to go
over all of that with my Mac gold
deposit and I'm going to apply that on
to my cheeks and over everywhere I put
the now using hot mama from the balm I'm
using this blush on the apples of my
cheeks and then I'm going to use the
Jaclyn Hills champagne pop and I'm just
using this as a highlight on the top of
my cheekbones and I'm also going to
apply a little bit down my nose
I'm using a bad habit which is the car
pop ultra matte lip and I'm using this
on my lips it's a gorgeous pink shade
and I just feel it complements the eyes
really really well and that is the last
step of a look and I really hope you
guys enjoyed this free simple of using
the vice palette very colourful very
edgy and very different and please let
me know your thoughts in the comments
I'll see you guys next time
bye soyal movie in 7 seconds of that
naming it off that's cancer and then you
expect the void to die but she dies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
