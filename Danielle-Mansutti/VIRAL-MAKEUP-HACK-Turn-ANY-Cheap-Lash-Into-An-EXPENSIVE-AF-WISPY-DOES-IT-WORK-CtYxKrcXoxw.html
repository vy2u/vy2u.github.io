literally like 7:30 in the morning woke
up an hour ago and I went on Twitter and
I saw overnight I was like super viral
tweet about eyelashes this little beauty
hack is incredible and if it works I'm
going to be so happy because it's gonna
save all of us so much money when it
comes to lashes so I am very excited to
test this out and to see if it truly
works or not but if you have not seen
the video yourself I saw it this morning
because Nikki's charl quite tweeted it
so you can see on this video essentially
all is is use a spoolie brush on
eyelashes even if they're really cheap
and synthetic and they can look wispy
and beautiful and Mike you've spent so
much money on them these are the two
lash styles that I'm going to test this
out on so these are both Danny Beauty
lashes they are synthetic so it'll be
very interesting to see if we can make
it wispy and fluttering and like the
kind of lashes you spend 20 plus dollars
on because these I love today the sunday
11th of March is retail as extreme
chokers for five dollars 45 us so are
very very very affordable lashes so
these lashes as you can see in a
synthetic style this one is Luna and
then this one is called fleur I'm
actually super excited to see what flow
it does as they are synthetic anyway
there is fluttery as it can possibly be
so I'm very excited to see if we can
make this even more whiskey than they
already are all right I'm gonna switch
now to my point of view and I'm so
excited to see the result so here are
the two lashes that I just showed you
guys I'll give you a close-up for us so
you can just see a proper before so this
is how they look before and from the
side and then with Luna as you can see
they are a little bit more single
synthetic plastic let's start with Fleur
and then we'll go on to Luna because I
just they're very different styles that
will be very interesting to see what
does what and then we have a spoolie
brush here I'm pretty sure you can use
absolutely any at all so just double
checking I'm pretty sure they were
pretty rough
with their lashes and this I just feel
weird like being rough with lashes I'm
not used to that but okay
here we go so I've had about two minutes
of constant rubbing and I can already
see that there is such a difference
between the two so looking like
super-close these look so much more like
natural and wispy whereas these are very
like uniform and straight so it really
really really has worked it has me the
lashes look a lot shorter you can see
that they do look much longer when
they're super uniform and everything but
I mean looking at the ends of the hairs
and comparing them to one another there
is literally such a big difference like
this is so much wispier and softer and
more hair like and this is just straight
and uniformed I don't know how with me
we're gonna achieve with this just
because of the style of them let's go
the gold guys I mean if we can do this
much with what I'm very excited to see
what we can do with Luna
so here is the side which hasn't been
touched as opposed to the side that I
have just used my spoolie brush on I
found that this style however is not
best for wispy I guess I would prefer to
wear this anyway rather than the wispy
style personally because I think just
because of the cat eye style that it is
when it is wispy although it does look
you know nice and natural and like real
hairs
it isn't a particularly like natural
lash if you know what I mean it is
interesting mode to see the difference
because there's obviously so many more
fibers on something like flat as opposed
to lunar so the fibers make all the
difference so I know now not to do it on
lashes that are kind of single hair like
this it is best and most effective to do
them on lashes which are full let's
quickly spoolie this side to match this
and then let's try them on so now I've
done both sides they're looking like
proper expensive lashes now these are
like the kind of lashes that I pay a lot
more than five dollars for for now like
so natural and wispy like I literally
didn't think synthetic lashes could look
like this
I didn't even know it was possible they
look so so good so let me grab a normal
pair flirt and let's compare them side
to side there's top right 1/2 flirt
would normally look and then the bottom
right is with all the wispy spoolie
stuff underneath I think within like
these two on the left you can really see
the difference like there is such a
massive difference from doing this
technique so I am now going to pop these
on my eyes I want to see how natural
they actually will look on the eye
I actually feel like there's like less
shine on the lashes too so if I grab the
normal flirts because they are synthetic
I suppose they will shine a bit more but
they seem to shine less which is super
interesting well just before I pop on
the glue I just want to show you out of
the packet how they look now all right
it's the moment of truth
I'm so excited so I'm just waiting for
the glue to dry on this lash but I just
want to show you a side-by-side
comparison so this is the one with the
wispy latch on and this is without and I
can't tell you like how flipping natural
this looks like this actually just looks
like I have really really really long
eyelashes this does not look synthetic
at all like at all oh this is so cool
now the lashes are on both of my eyes I
think they speak for themselves I can't
believe how good look like oh my god I
just look like I have really really long
natural beautiful lashes really
Konigsberg how much of a game changer
this is no more you have to buy
ridiculously expensive lashes that you
can get the same wispy beautiful full
looking effect with lashes which was
cheaper stays and I will leave these
link below I would just so highly
recommend getting flirt from Johnny big
for this because I am just so impressed
with how my lashes look right now and
just how natural and beautiful and wispy
they look and hair like like the biggest
thing is that they literally look like
eyelash hairs which is like impossible
to supply with synthetic lashes so this
definitely works this is something I am
definitely gonna keep doing and thank
you guys for watching this very quick
video I had to do this morning because I
was like does this work and it does I'm
so excited I'll see you guys in my next
video which will be tomorrow as much
upload something else today but I'm so
excited by this so I'm loading this now
and then I will have another video
tomorrow so see you guys there and until
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
