Channel today I have done a Valentine's
Day
makeup tutorial something is very girly
very glittery and pink and I personally
love pink makeup and just getting all
girly and of course if you want to see
more of these looks in the future then
don't feel shy to subscribe to my
channel and I'll we bring you out more
Valentine's Day looks and this is a
preparation with the goddess for Easter
on YouTube if you're not familiar with
Tori's she does many videos like I do
and we thought we would Club and make a
Valentine's Day tomorrow because it's so
much fun so yeah I'll leave some pics
here for you guys so you can get to know
her a little bit better and check out
her tutorial I really hope that you
enjoy the tutorial today and let's get
right into it I'm starting off with the
Rimmel London lasting finish primer
because we want to make sure that on a
date I'll make up those dark patchy
because we all know that is incredibly
sexy it's just ensures that I'm using my
lumi magique foundation in the shade I'm
just gonna do my foundation first and
then I'm gonna do my eye makeup and then
my contouring because I don't want it to
be you know a classic Fallout we all
love eyes shadow fallout after we've
done a nice base
going to justify one of that sexy pile
highlighted orange face look so the
foundation is on and it's nap time for
my eyebrows and I'm using the shade
during one I use this for my outline and
then I'm going with the chichi IRA
mental in reading Brown to fill in the
inside of my brows I'm just using this
in the arch of my brows I just find that
you have more control over the product
with a gel like this than you do with a
pencil pencils just like service money
and this is also a lot easier for
building a gradient your eyebrows so
once my product starts getting a bit low
on the brush that's when I start to do
I'm just gonna begin with the shade
white chocolate and just pack this all
over my eyes just so that I haven't even
stopped to my eyeshadow I like to apply
a black color first it is an alternative
to getting a primer but I like to just
make sure that the eyes all just be one
color
I'm taking this soft brown warmer color
and I'm just going to apply this to my
crease just as a transition color I'm
taking the shade white-chocolate once
again and I'm just going to put this
underneath my brows just as a highlight
now I am applying the shade strawberry
blonde vana
just packing this all over my lids just
because I want this to have quite a pink
finish and I am having a ton of filete
into my eyelashes which is pretty
attractive but just like because it
would look good me and I promise now I'm
taking this darker Brown and I'm just
going to apply it in the outer V of my
eye and I'm also going to be bringing it
up into my crease I'm also going to drag
this down slightly into my lower lash
line just so that I have the transition
going away from my crease down to my
bottom lashes now I'm taking the shade
cherry cordial I'm just gonna places
from the out of a towards the middle of
my eye just to have a sort of like a
depth in my eye and make it a little bit
more smokey
I'm just going to blend this out I'm
just taking the cherry cordial shade and
I'm just going to drag this down to my
lower lash lines that I'm going to end
in the middle now I'm taking my NYX roll
on shimmer and I'm just going to apply
this from the inner corner of my eyes
out to the middle just for a little bit
of sparkle because it's a valentine's
day tutorial I thought why not I'm just
packing this onto my lids and I'm also
going to place it in the inner corner so
my tremor did just die but I think all
you missed out on me saying was that I'm
using to be get big lashes from essence
it's a volume boasting waterproof
mascara and I'm just applying this to my
lashes and I know I have Craig's ego to
pull out right now this is why I'm doing
my lashes last we are gonna clean this a
Love Bug don't worry mascara really does
make a difference doesn't it it's pretty
easy I'm using a white eyeliner pencil
from Chi Chi and I'm going to place this
from the inner corner of my lower lash
line to
middle just to open up my eye a little
bit and give a nice write securely
finish and my eyes are super red today
because my contacts are really annoying
me I really want to get laser eye
surgery because I'm so loosing these
guys we are just adding the white
eyeliner just to about the middle here
I'm just gonna add some eyelashes
because I feel like it just completes
the look and brings it all together and
I'm using the glamour ones by Adele this
is always where my least favorite part
this always makes me wanna cry and these
are just very natural lashes because I
didn't want to do anything too dramatic
cuz it will be for like a Valentine's
Day date and you don't want to scare
them away so now is gonna fix up all my
mistakes and my fall outs my crazy
glitter fallouts with the maybelline
instant age
I'm using this sponge which is from a
chichi I'm just going to place the
concealer in this section here because I
want to clean up all the eyeshadow mess
that I've made and it's also going to
help clean up the edges and the touch
lines of the eyeshadow follow the shape
of my eye
upwards when I do this because it just
helps to are going to add some
cheekbones so I'm going to do a little
line here and then I'm going to assume
we we're not going with this which is
the other professional powder brush and
just blend it out because I don't want
the contrary to be like super intense
because it's that's always nice to make
up stir isn't it yeah okay maybe miss
Wiggly hello I'm now taking the banana
powder shake in the
kiddush it's getting cooler for me I'm
just gonna pop this under my eyes this
is just going to set the concealer that
we provide before and it also just seems
a little bit more coverage to the under
eye area I also have to miss down the
sides of my nose because it Slim's it
out even more so yeah next I'm taking
the NYX baked blush and it's this nice
shimmery pink and as you guys know I
hardly ever wear blush yep this is
everyone I just have my very good things
about Nick's blushes so I run down to
Target today and enjoy yeah
this is like a nice dark pink orangey
color and I think it matches the eyes
also we will give it that much and our
last set for today is highlights arm is
taking the highlighting shade from the
contour kit and I'm just going to
highlight just above my cheekbones here
in here down my nose and then
so last but not least I am using the
Rimmel London pocalypse this is in the
shade dead pink and I'm going to just
put this on my lips it is a nice girly
obviously so yeah I'm gonna focus on my
lips and then that will be the look
completed don't you stick around this
long Taylor tutorial I love you thank

well and always seeing you really soon
