channel today I have a Valentine's Day
makeup tutorial there's lots of pinks
and purples in this look I know you guys
are always like Teddy stop with the pink
it's Valentine's Day and all that was do
pink again this week all we got to stuff
like Browns and cool tones a lot kind of
stuff soon it's true but I think if this
look pretty simple and pink and girly
cuz I feel like Valentine's Day is all
about enhancing your natural features
but the majority of you guys are aware
I've been single for a while now so my
Valentine's Day is going to consist of
waiting till the 15th of February so I'm
going to the shops and get all the 50%
off Valentine's Day chocolate so you
guys have a wonderful Valentine's Day
because super lucky and have it take
time things up you know if you decided
to wear my makeup look I'd love to see
photos are you recreating it so let's
jump into the tutorial to start with
today I'm going to use the Mac dip dirty
blonde so the fine route gel cream I
haven't use this and so on I really
sometimes for energies but because my
hair's a little bit light I want to see
if this is gonna work I guess it's okay
it's a little bit reddish but we'll work
with it it's all good so I'm just going
to fill in the natural shape of my brows
because I want this look to be really
soft and really pretty I didn't want to
go like dramatic crazy brows or anything
so I'm just gonna fall in touch
just sort of like fill in areas like
this a bit more I'm not going ahead and
taking a clear brow gel this is five
savvy and I'm going to just put this in
my brows to ensure that they're gonna
stay in place I'm really happy with this
color of both line brow gel cream I feel
like it matches my hair really well it
does look a little bit warm on camera
but that's because my white balance
sucks
I'm taking my Mac stop okay painter pot
and I'm going to apply this all over my
lid I'm just using a concealer brush I'm
also going to drag it up with a little
bit just above the lid so being a
hundred percent honest with you guys
I've been practicing lots of different
looks for this Valentine's Day tutorial
and none of them I'm super happy with so
I'm just gonna wing it
and I absolutely know any what we're
gonna do because we'll be using this
part today it's the Anastasia Beverly
Hills self made palette and I'm aiming
to only use colors from this palette no
no it's so annoying when you're watching
a tutorial and they use like the back
two propellants and you're like what so
I think I'm going to use this shade quad
blossom I'm going to use metallic plum
and definitely pink champagne
so to begin today I'm going to use a
metallic plum and I'm using a sigma
short shader brush which looks like this
and I'm just going to on the very very
very outside of my eye
I'm also going to drag it across I know
this looks so awful but trust me once
it's all blended it will be fine imagine
if I was like and we're done
no way so next we're going to move on to
this joke here called blossom
now I'm going to use pink champagne and
I'm going to apply this as you probably
guessed right here noticing a diffused
crease brush as a spy stigma and we're
just going to start blending all the
colors together now this Sigma buff and
blend brush I'm going to use this Shane
Keough quarter hot chocolate and we're
going to use this as our crease color
I'm now using this shade called buttery
I'm going to use it underneath my
eyebrow as a highlight and now we're
moving on to eyeliner which is always a
serious part for me I'm using me in what
am c77 eyeliner gel for playlist and I'm
also going to use a sigma angled brow
brush as well
can I have a general outline of my
eyeliner just to your sort of clean up
the edges here I'm going to take my
concealer and at the moment I'm using B
Anastasio Beverly Hills concealer and
this is in a 1.5 also just going to use
a concealer brush and I'm going to just
clean up the edges here and also bring
the concealer down around here and make
a little bit of triangle computing part
and I'm taking my NYX jumbo pencil and
then apply this in my waterline but I'll
also be adding a mixture of blossom and
pink champagne
to my lower lash line and then applying
mascara just so you know exactly what
I'm going to do
my cutter I'm applying the Rimmel stay
matte powder this is in 0:05 still keep
beach
I'm using the Anastasia Beverly Hills
contour kit and for my contour today I'm
going to using this warm shade here it
is so difficult we'd be doing chatty
videos at the moment because you've
probably heard in the background a lot
and I've said it in so many videos now
that the builders are building a house
that's how I did so well my windows are
closed and everything but it's just like
there's so many baby hands right now
didn't L forget that I just hit 21 and
the baby heads are like hello I'm using
a little luxe petite brush and I'm gonna
dip it in that same contour shade and
then tap off the excess oh you don't
want excess on this point they're going
to start to Quantrill my news so I'm
just going to go down the sides I'm
using this banana shade I'm going to
place it underneath my eyes underneath
here and then a little bit on my
forehead as well then I'm taking this
large my makeup gate which is called
spellbound and it matches my dad oh and
it looks too primitive I could be
careful
and now I'm looking at mary-lou manizer
by the balm as my highlight and I'm
gonna use the contour brush that I used
before is I brought down two brushes I
don't know why my life brush is gone
it's so pigmented Oh be careful as well
this on top much cheaper and I'm just
doing it down my nose to make it an
illusion like I've had a nose job
we're so shiny now I'm not going to
quickly align my lips using this store
by Mac coming always those bags I'm just
going to outline them but not over too
ugly too much for my lips today I am
using the Too Faced melted metal
lipstick in melted peony so I'd love to
say a huge thank you for watching this
tutorial I really hope you guys enjoyed
it and please let me know if you ever
decide to recreate this I'd love to see
the photo
just use the hashtag Pham city on
Instagram and I will find you have a
great Valentine's Day guys I love you
