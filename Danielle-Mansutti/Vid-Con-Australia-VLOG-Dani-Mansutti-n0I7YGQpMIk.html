I'm in Melbourne I'm in my old room the
room where all the YouTube started my
yuichi channel was born in front of this
window it's a little desk there so I'm
gonna get my hair done today I'm gonna
get it dyed hopefully like lighter and
whiter
I'll start like brunette or blonde for a
while now while I'm a little bit light
it's best to go like really light now
and then if I want to go brunette it's
easier than to go brunette and then
blonde again I really hope that it just
comes out like what I want because right
now this is hair that hasn't been washed
in about a week and has been troubled on
has been troubled on a plane Wow tonight
is the opening VidCon party so excited
about that it's gonna be a lot of
creators there I'm so excited to meet so
many of them and I'm so excited to see
so many things that I already know I was
I'm so nervous that I was like I am just
at the beginning of being nervous I
pushed myself because I was like I just
want to make the most of it and do like
as many panels meet as many of you guys
I'm so excited this hairs just keeps
falling on my face so my mom is gonna be
coming along with me actually my dad
will be there too and they are so like
involved in my YouTube life behind the
scenes so I think I'll be so much fun I
don't see them very often as you guys
know who live on the other side well to
them I'm thinking like a a shiaa cooler
blonde and just like blonde oh all over
I'm so excited
hello everyone it has been quite a few
hours since you saw me last my hair is a
slightly different color since you saw
me last as well but my mom and I have
just finished getting ready we're going
to go to the VidCon opening party now
are you like ariana grande
kind of hairstyle because it's just like
really weird all down so we're working
with this tonight this is our hotel room
we are staying in the Pan Pacific and
it's very big isn't it mum there's my
makeup station but this is the view of
Mel better thing to show you
The Melvins dark yeah I'll quickly give
you a little up and close of the makeup
gold and bronze E and blonder so
everything looks differ
your hairs a little bit of a different
color because it's just kind of fun oh
it just works differently so my hair is
like a bit a shiaa now unfortunately I
couldn't quite get the color that I
showed you guys before that I wanted
because in Brighton there's hard water
has a lime scale in the water basically
I have lots of mineral sitting on my
hair I had bleach on my hair for over an
hour and this is as light as we go we
couldn't possibly get the nice bright
white we wanted so I was a little bit
bummed about that
it color isn't exactly what I wanted but
I'm sure that I will grow you know to
love it oh well it's nothing I can do
about that my hair is in that certain
condition but well my eyes are
Jacqueline hill and Inglot pigment and
my lashes aren't secret I just rated
myself to my first ever I need to remind
me why we spend I actually saw this in
Selfridges when I was Italia and I
looked at it it's really hard to use one
hand and she said to me it's such a you
bag and I was like oh but I don't iron a
single nice clutch and now I do it's so
pretty
so what's going on its maiden voyage
tonight oh no we are on again at the bus
it is just learning goals
mum's got her fish &amp;amp; chips on the go the
only one eating at the whole event do
your best and smooth
just casually go puns my old apartment
it is now the next day and we are
heading off to the YouTube lounge today
I have a panel which is building a
YouTube community let's talk about
YouTube communities and then I have a
meet and greet legislature which is two
hours and I'm so excited for that's like
my highlight it's just gonna meet people
we are gonna see if we can scavenge some
free breakfast some work is slightly
hungry I'm still on English time so I
woke up at 3:00 I am like so hungry my
mom and dad are both here
oh just chillin over there they're gonna
be part of it so you'll see them a lot
today as well we're gonna head off I
have an interview and then start the
panels I'm so anxious but I'm so excited
all travel and closing doors for me in
something
share your kind comments and I'm
thinking what am i right verify never
used a fidget spin-up
I love this I need this light in
my back there we go
note to self I'm just trying to like cry
myself before my sound stops and no
feeling in the world just like he's
sitting down right next to my uncle it's
just weird and you see with people that
you know are mine and I've never been
I've never had an experience like this
with so many communities in the one
building it's very surreal but I'm very
fun I'm sure we can be found by so it's
like adrenaline and nerves and anxiety
but I see like just having a quick peek
of general how nervous for that I'm
really now but I don't start 30 minutes
early as always I just saw on Twitter
someone post this like 40 minutes early
already there I'm gonna be on the
biggest stage there's already people
waiting and I'm the only one they
hitting the pre checking my own she's
kind of chillin think about what I'm
gonna say and so we but I thought there
be a table but because it's not I'm
actually like how should I sit like I
don't know II think it's good to get the
biggest one out the way first I reckon
because I think that once will be a
breeze compared to it we're on our way
to the panel
to the first day the first petal of the
first VidCon Australia panelists
introduce themselves starting down here
with Tim now based in London as well
it's so good to be back here because
this is my home in Melbourne you
graduated here I graduated in this room
back in the day when act is whatever you
have like posted them in your room you
wouldn't ever have a conversation with
them but with the community you can
directly talk to your youtuber or in
many different ways or you can just tag
them and drawings and they can see it
and stuff like that it's just more like
direct and I feel that it is more like a
friendship thing than like a fan base
yeah I mean I think about how a fan base
is more like okay so here's all the
people that enjoy your stuff looking at
you and what you make and then a
community it's kind of like sure they
can appreciate you and what you make but
also you're in that circle with them and
they interact with each other to you has
so many different communities that no
matter who you are you fit into one and
every single community is slightly
different so how I connect with my
audience is that I pretty much ask them
to make every single life decision for
me and then pretty much on the
entrepreneur a lot be like should I go
brunette blonde on Instagram if there's
ever like a lot of negativity at one
point that I'll make a post and I'll say
comment one
the person above you and that just
brings like this nice audience will make
friends and I think that the biggest
thing is engagement and actually
treating your community as equals
because if you ever act like you're
superior to them all you're more
important to them they feel like they
can't connect as well when you're like
I'm here and listening to you it makes a
lot of difference that's awesome what a
good idea that's really cool
who wants to start with that one
yeah I think if you know that people are
upset about something that you've done
whether they've seen the full version of
it or the edited version of the demo
videos I think the most important thing
to do is if it's constructive as well
it's not just like I hate your videos
because of X Y Z but if it's actually
like this really upset me this really
offended me I think that we're always
constantly growing as people like we
have to keep growing up to keep learning
from our mistakes and I feel like if you
better know that you listen and you
don't don't respond in quite like a
nasty you know passive-aggressive way I
think that's the best way to move
forward from it because if they know
that you're hearing them then they feel
a sense of like oh okay well I might
trust her again now but you can use
attack them back and say well you
shouldn't be offended because I don't
care that obviously it's going to be
like well I'm not part of this community
more it doesn't sit well with me so I
think the biggest thing is to listen
learn from it and then change really
nail which I have a funny thing to say
but I think many of you follow my
channel you know that I literally spend
every single day in my room alone
talking to a camera related
yeah actually the closet really
sentiment in key so I found my best
friend through YouTube and she was
actually a subscriber of mine he was
incredibly supportive and lived in
London you may know Talley a month if
you guys follow her and I think for me
I've made so many friends through my
community and that's my highlight
because it's so amazing fighting with
like-minded people on all sides of the
globe no matter where you go or for us
we're very lucky there might be someone
that knows us to help us out and just is
there for us that's the most amazing
thing that's that comes from me roll
into some Twitter question if that
hashtag up there
call out a comment and talk about it
like a like feature one of the people
who watch your video and you know
because there's this there's this
amazing feeling when a creator that you
love and and content that you love to
watch suddenly like picks you out of the
crowd is like hey so it so had this
amazing idea last video or had this
incredible comment and I just wanted to
like share it with all of you because I
was so excited by seeing it your
community aren't gonna feel connected to
you until they see there's something
different about you that I've really
really like and they want to stick on to
so I think definitely just being open
about your struggles as well and making
not like your that like I'm so perfect
with
just want to be completely open so
people can relay and I think that's the
biggest thing for connecting with the
trust and building the community dun dun
thank god no good our way finally I mean
that we were the nervous why we was I
think we were okay the other two a bike
the pro is the middle language like I
have my meet and greet in about an hour
so I just ran upstairs to fix my makeup
because my lashes like half hanging off
which was delightful yeah but my panel
is done when I came off I was like okay
like I didn't know because I didn't I
don't know I don't know but everyone is
saying to me it was fine but you know
how you just overthink everything but it
was fine that is the biggest puddle that
I'm doing and that's done now and have
my main great I'm very very excited
about it's my main greats two hours and
I am just really excited to meet you
guys because you guys are gonna put me
in the best mood of all my anxiety is
like off the scale today that's why I'm
up here actually I just need to be in a
quiet space like half an hour before
returning because otherwise I'll just be
bad and nervous again but it's so much
fun but it is it is super super super
intense but you always think you look
more nervous than you are I suppose I'm
sure you're fine so yeah I'm going to
head up to my meet and greet breathe so
excited to meet you guys
it's happening guys the e's are out
there coming to the meet and greet I'm
sorry I bumped into Patrick's dog
so just walked in the door after my main
great oh my god I love meeting you guys
it means the world to me and it is so
lovely to hear how many of you tell me
that I helped you with your anxiety and
mental health stuff that means the
absolute world to me and I'm now going
to relax a little bit I'm going to read
your letters from stage making great I'm
so excited to read your letters too I'm
gonna grab some food stop it in my face
but it was so lovely meeting you and
thank you to everyone that waited and
lined up for me because it was so nice
it's two hours of happiness and smiles
meeting you all that sounds so cliche
but you know to me so lovely to see you
in person and you guys mean the world to
me and it's time to read your letters
yes good morning guys so good morning
guys I'm wearing for the light to close
today isn't that insane I'm in
Instagram Facebook LAN chuckle my
oversharing panel in about ten minutes
so much more it goes that soon that's
what the cabochon stuff and we're
currently deciding the Instagram
what guys look around like purple on my
lids it kind of matches my shirt I'm
excited it should be good day I'm just
hanging out in the Instagram I just look
what bumped into even follow Tanya ELISA
in the description yes follow me if you
want to but then he's like the hottest
girl alive I understand why everyone
follows that I'm like looking at her ID
 I'm intimidated she's so hot
have a mouthful of Chris won't Quaffle
I'm gonna go to my panel now I got the
sneaky way behind the behind the lifts
the business glamorous office to go
behind the scenes I think I need to feel
a level to check in for my panel and
start my panel
Tanya was a siren noise Tanya Tanya are
they Tanya Danielle she's lovely
so glad I met her she was so like
down-to-earth so we are still I'm to
anyone city I have a channel called any
men city or like too long at digging
Trevor loves and up to what mental
health and people think that I can take
you a little bit more because I feel
like a more baggy but the more reserved
you are I suppose the less people will
criticize in that sense but also the
less connection appeal to use that
Dartmouth lights you that much
I think for me I had to learn the line
where
when I speak about mental health on my
channel I want it to be helpful for
people sailing if they're going for it I
can listen they can understand they can
relate that I feel so alone anymore
rather than me approaching it in like a
self-pity way more crying complaint my
must have heart and stuff like I just
think it's something that I've had to
learn of time to even like I wouldn't
move I never approaches saying it's a
weakness but I'd say that we're kind of
like it's always like when you imagine a
diamond and we have sandpaper constantly
rubbing on us and then you eventually
you get this amazing thing at the end
and you can tell someone like how do you
go through it and almost like share that
story you know that's beautiful
and I just I feel blessed me because I
started up doing like makeup abuse and I
do you every now and then as well but it
wasn't really me well then like you say
that's like legit without a mask every
day and be like this is my mom and now
I'm a happy character on my time on
himself but inside that I like couldn't
get out of bed for three days straight
so so depressed so once I finally
actually opened up to people and said by
the way I have all these struggles it
just completely changed and it made me
feel like I could actually relax me
myself so I feel in a way that kind of
oversharing help me
play as well yeah that's me I think
that's a video or just a certain person
on YouTube but every single video is
like overly positive but you can even
always kind of see through it you just
think is that really like how it is for
you because sometimes you kind of wish
is a few eyes which you just feel like a
completely open and honest I was
actually going on I just like make this
show about their lives and we don't do
it it's an industry we make everything
look slightly better than innovative so
we're used to doing that but sometimes
if I want to create a and they're
actually open about their struggles I
feel like we trust them more because
they're giving me that sensitive
information so I think it would help I
can make us boy leaving my panel now it
was good I was so much less nervous than
I was yesterday and I really like the
topic that we talked about we talked
about mental help a lot which you guys
know I was passionate about and I stayed
back and I met so many of you afterwards
you shared your story to me and it's
just like you guys make me one cry at
like seriously sure I see the best
advice I've oh wow like to do my last
petal now
by finish on two panels today with the
lovely out there no wonder you guys
watch her in space and its personality
and this heart
wow how many clothes for today about the
fermion I'm just saying you should do
one of those 365 day like ripoff
calendars and I'm in the bathroom with
its original her he's perfect right of
course
see you all know if you're only have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
