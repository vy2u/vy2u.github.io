little bit of a detox good2talk detox
cleanse right now so I've been traveling
over the last few weeks
I'm also very sick and I think it's
because I go from like hot country coal
country home country cause I've got a
cold hence when a bit nasally whatever
I'm nasally I see on wall Australian
again so it's a bit of a weird one so I
pick it this morning before I eat my
breakfast or anything I want to show you
what I'm eating in a day right now and
where I'm at right now is I just got
back from Dubai two days ago and when I
was in Dubai I was eating up a storm
like spaghetti for breakfast lunch and
dinner
cuz you have to indulge on holiday
that's what it's all about so right now
I'm feeling a little bit like oh they
could put out about two kilos or so in
such a short amount of time I am like
detoxing a little bit and I want to show
you what I eat and what I do on these
times of need we're not like losing
weight is the main focus its just
feeling health again because you know
after you've been indulging for a long
time or binging because the last two
days is I mean back I have finished so
today is the day that all changes going
to eat healthy again I'm going to show
you what I eat what I do I'll also take
you to gym with me this morning I have a
bunch of meetings BIOS Skype which I'll
smash our first and then we'll go to gym
together but I'm about to make breakfast
now I have actually this morning before
I film this I've had two full baths of
water and I've had a tape I will
actually make another tape and put honey
in it this time because it might and
when we go to kids he's gonna keep in
mind I like oh I'm so I'm so bad I've
lost so much muscle like in the last
three months I've been to gym maybe like
four times so I'm not doing the best
right now so I have a tiny little bottom
again my muscles all gone but I'll take
you lonely anyway and you'll see my work
anyway I'm gonna take Missy downstairs
I'm gonna get her her brekkie as well
and then we're gonna film what I'm
eating this morning right let's get this
show
all right so as you guys heard me say
before I have already had a tea today
but I am gonna make another one and pour
a whole lot of honey in it so I have
yogurty in my opinion it is the best
team and because I live in Brighton and
we have hard water with lime scale and
all this fantastic stuff I'm just gonna
use bottled water to like my cattle so
we're on our way to like two and a half
liters it's just good I find it's best
to hydrate first thing in the morning
before eating as well even though I'm
like not making sense for some reason I
can't film today I promise it does make
my mind your head up sorry I
because of water this is in
my suppressant only thing with such is
because if you've had a bit of an
indulgent week like I have it's good to
hydrate and flush out all that beginning
boy good morning really gorgeous right
let's this bad boy here is an unfiltered
view of my fridge I actually don't know
what I have in here right now so I've
got all this stuff I accumulated from
when my family stayed over I literally
haven't even touched it like pumpkin
sauce oh I hate barbecue sauce so I have
some champagne some roasted veggies that
we're gonna cook up light up some
chicken fish cakes salmon grapes
tomatoes mango eggs so I have a tank of
jelly and some energy drink so it's
looking pretty good in here right now
which is most likely caused from the
fact that I benched everything bad that
was in the fridge because we all know
it's like an unwritten rule you have to
eat all the bad things in your house
before you can start it could get inside
that she'd sweat like crazy with it so I
made breakfast we are going to cook up
some scrambled eggs and I'm gonna cook
some tomatoes with it as well so these
are just I think these are like medium
large size eggs I'm gonna have three and
I'm also going to have some toast as
well
I swear every time that's like I sound
it's like clanging place she disappears
so I'm just getting the pan going and
I'm gonna throw in my eggs
I personally don't mix them with
anything I just put them in as they are
I don't like weather so I don't mix them
with butter I just put them straight in
and then it's literally the easiest
thing ever you just makes it I'm gonna
throw in some tomatoes mutters pop them
in and I've just got it running and like
a medium setting it's gonna pop this
back in the fridge there's literally the
easiest thing those scrambled eggs so as
you saw I just threw it all into the pan
and then it is now just a case of mixing
it and getting up all the scrambled bits
fat presentation though well I'm just
gonna put on a little bit of black
pepper over my eggs
the most important ingredient or sauce I
suppose you could say when it comes to
eggs is HP sauce we're at my HP people
out because you literally can't have
scrambled eggs and not have HP sauce you
know what I'm saying and here's my
brekkie so I am going to plow through
this water and this T's well what are
you making took
all right my Skype meetings are done it
is now quarter past 10:00 I'm gonna head
to gymnast SEC but just as some energy
for myself I'm gonna have a banana and I
know this sounds really weird but I just
love mashing up my bananas they just I
don't know I love it
I would prefer this was a little bit
more spotty so it'd be like sweeter but
I'll show you what I do it'll it shows
like baby food but I love it alright
she's getting mashed and the reason why
I do this is that I honestly feel like
it makes the banana taste so much
sweeter but I love through so much that
I love doing anything that'll make it
last longer like I can eat a banana in
two seconds but this will take me a
little bit longer to eat but I love that
because I'm the kind of person you like
just sucks on everything to make it
laughs so like chopped up to ten of the
pieces that I just love to eat it looks
like absolute bomb but it's gonna taste
incredible and give me a little bit of
energy before Jim you just don't have
anything not official like a pre-workout
anything like that so that's a minute
I'm majority what I'm eating does not
process so I'm trying my best to just
eight fruits and veggies and mates and
everything else which is just straight
from the source
so instead of having an energy drink I
will have ever done alright I'm suited
and booted and ready for Jim as you can
see where is my bum where is it going
even if I push it it's gone you're gonna
get it back I'm just gonna throw on a
hoody and we aren't gonna
I made it first session back in Zulu
actually was good but towards the end I
couldn't breathe very well because of
this cold so I don't want to push myself
too hard but I just did a few extra
machines which I didn't film but before
I have a shower to wash with my stick
the most important thing for me to do
our end is my protein shakes I use bulk
powders I've used them for absolute
years and years and years like I think
maybe three years now my old PT Jesse
got me on them and the but sorry I'm
trying to like unscrew I don't know it's
an eye and yeah my OPC Jesse's like me
on them I've tried a bunch of different
flavors but in my opinion strawberry is
that OJ's I mean yeah sure we do but
banana is strawberry so oh my god I'm
making such a mess and I'm gonna grab my
almond milk put the little bit in top
this is that in oh I'm making a
massiveness Bon Appetit or as a sound
Twitter Bon Appetit I almost forgot to
include this it's like 1:00 p.m. right
now I just had a shower facemask
exfoliated all that stuff and I feel
absolute crap from this cold so I'm
gonna go ahead have a biscuit
and some tea oh my god I already feel
cured just looking at it YUM
hey guys so little update since we last
spoke I couldn't breathe probably about
a half an hour
like horrible cold stuff thought I would
rest my eyes ended up being a two-hour
nap survived monopoly Roy delirious
weird I have absolutely no appetite at
all but I know my body is just being an
idiot about matter when I get sick I
tend to like not have an appetite but I
always fight against ticks I know this
is the time of body needs nutrients so I
should be myself with good things to
make myself feel better instead of just
not eating so right now I am just crying
a potato so I'm gonna have some roast
potato and I'm also gonna have it we're
some salmon and some tomatoes and stuff
and then later on if I get peckish I'm
gonna have these fish cakes I was gonna
have like chicken veggies and rice
however I really don't think that I'll
be able to stomach that I'm ready to
force myself to salmon I do have the
chicken rice veggie like recipe do I
guess you could call it another bloke I
believe in a card for you if you do want
to check that out kind of ladies the
potato in for an hour but in 40 minutes
I'm gonna put in the salmon the salmon
goes in for 20 potatoes in for an hour
and I'm gonna Chum that down and drink
even water because my body is just
slowly fading away and now for the
salmon I don't actually see the only
thing I just put it in it a little foil
bed and I'm gonna pop it in the oven
next to the tady
for about 20 minutes
this looks so good I am so ready to
smash there so we've got our salmon
potato and veggies YUM so my meal is
done I am currently sitting here in all
my sick glory and I'm gonna stop well
I'm not I'm gonna start I have just
started watching the crown I really want
to find like a new Netflix series to
watch so I'm gonna give the crown ago
and because it's like 6 p.m. now I'm
gonna give myself a treat and I'm gonna
go melt up some chocolate so what I do
is I just get the top row like five
blocks of chocolate stick it in the
microwave melts it I know a lot people
find that so bizarre ét melted chocolate
but I love it and I find that the
chocolate lasts so much longer and like
I just I'm more most weird people it
just loves melting chocolate so alright
let's get these treats on the road it
just looks like the school's meadow
chopped it right up when it's melted
that covers the whole plate it just lost
Asian tastes amazing
okay so those six squares is now
transformed into this this is just home
carrying my chocolate because the plate
is very hot as you can see it looks like
a lot more chocolate than it did before
so it's time for Netflix and treat them
yet and now the final meal of the day
I'm gonna cook up these Cod sweet potato
chili fish cakes and here it is my last
meal of the day and oh my god it looks
I have actually tried this before let's
get a taste test no it is now bedtime

eat I was trying to eat the rice chicken
and veggies but didn't feel up to it so
