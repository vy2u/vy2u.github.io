channel today I'm doing my first pack
with me video this is my suitcase and
these are my awesome socks
I never filmed like on the floor of my
room what was is really weird this is my
suitcase I use but absolutely everything
as you can see it's a little bit
well-traveled and a little bit dirty so
as I'm traveling to England tonight I
thought I would show you a pack with me
style video sort of tips and tricks that
I've learnt to pack well let me get rid
of all these tags on this is my moldy
stuff yeah you do have any tags in your
bag take them off before you start
packing because the people here but will
get really annoyed by it
this bag is by the brand American
Tourister loose pack AB salutely
everything let me open up the bag here's
the inside of my bag the way I normally
packet is by putting in my toiletries
and undies and stuff like that in this
thing with the mesh zip thing on it and
I put all my clothes and my technology
and stuff like that in here I actually
have a lot of fake tents days in my bag
and I have stand the bottom of my bag
when it comes to the packing process the
thing that I like to do first is my
clothes but the first thing that you
ought to do before you pack your clothes
will be the most important thing is to
actually check the weather of where
you're going before you go it is I'm out
in England but I have been told by you
guys apparently it's not very warm there
it looks like it is going to be raining
every single day looks like I should
pack lots of layers she packs them with
stuff which is waterproof and of course
you do not want to forget your underwear
exactly a bunch of things sitting right
next to me including a whole bunch of
undies yeah you have so what many pairs
of leggings it should be a little like
it's really only there for a week and
because I meant for family reasons I'm
just taking casual comfy clothes not
taking going out clothes I think there
is no there comes up like I have to go
out something I will go out and buy a
cheap outfit instead of worrying about
it and taking up more room in my bag and
I've decided to bring only three
t-shirts I don't know you don't really
need
that many t-shirts you can layer
t-shirts make it like you are wearing
different one every day with a different
coat on top burn Accords and absolutely
massive essential you don't want to
forget good pajamas these are also
really great for just like slouching
around if you are going to a hotel or
something always bring pajamas just
something to change into to be super
comfy I'm gonna do with the piles much
and put it in my suitcase on its side I
don't like second clothes on top of each
other in the suitcase because it takes
up way too much room I know it's like
the traditional way to pack would trust
me it takes up so much room and then if
you want like one top you go to rummage
through your whole suitcase to find it
this makes it so much easier so what you
do is you have your clothes in a pile
like I do here and what I'm going to do
is I'm going to put in like that I'm
going to put it in on its side and by
putting in the clothes on this side not
only can you actually see each item of
clothing without having to rummage
through it but as you can see it takes
up like no room at all and you have so
much extra music oh so it's a really
good little travel hack because I want
to travel at this time as well I'm only
going to be taking two pairs of shoes
with me so if I take some black heeled
boots I feel like you can wear everyday
and you can also if you do go out
somewhere also going to take my white
converse because not only do I feel like
these are a really good little casual
shoe but if I do want to go on a long
walk whatever I can wear these as well
so I like taking shoes that I can use
for more than just one purpose so now
after clothes shoes and I'm Lisa put
away in my opinion the most important
thing it's the second most important
thing which for me is all my makeup I do
actually have a full video on how I pack
my makeup travel bag I'll link it below
for those who are interested to go and
check that out on one end I just have
all my makeup and on the other end I
have my brushes my brush cleaner and a
mirror as well most important things my
Minnie Mouse is you guys know every
single time through my makeup I put my
mouse is the thing I love about this bag
as well so which is very important when
it comes to your check and luggage you
need to know that your bag is going to
get thrown around like someone's going
to pick up your bag and literally throw
it on one side of the room they're very
rough with the way they had
exit airports bag like this everything
is squeezed together it's really tight
and a zips make the bag really tight so
I like that even if the plane is really
bumpy or my suitcase gets thrown around
my makeup isn't going to smash because
it is always a heartbreaking moment to
open up your bag and see your makeup his
stash because someone was throwing your
suitcase around so in order of
importance the next important thing is
toiletries I'm just going to put them in
this bag that I've got with some nice
stuff because big big big bag spending
is flexible and it has a zipper so it
does the job and they're like to think
about what I need and the importance
then they order it that way so obviously
the most important thing for me is to be
able to see so I like to pack my contact
lenses first and make sure I have enough
daily contact lenses to at last my trip
and then my second most important thing
is of course baton and then I'm also
going to pack my contact lens solution
as well as all my skincare so I like to
use the Garnier micellar water to take
off all my makeup because makeup pads
can be bent and they're squishing
everything I actually just put them in
the bag by themselves and actually put
them in victorious bags at the moment
I'm using the eve LOM brightening lotion
as well as the cleanser they are my
absolute favorites sliding in his leg
keeps changing also have stuff my
retainers and then I have the panthan in
which is actually for nappy rash but no
I don't actually have a nappy rash I
have to put this on my tattered still
pre fresh then I also have some lens
cleaner for my glasses as well as some
oil for my hair because my hair gets
stupid dry sometimes pretty much my
makeup in my toiletries will always take
up like the most amount of room I still
have a lot of gaps and stuff in my
suitcase to fill in so after I have done
clothing makeup and toiletries the next
most important thing to me is
electronics so I will start to grab
things like my hair straighteners my
hair brush charges or that kind of stuff
pretty much everything is packed besides
my camera I'm just going to dip up this
mesh part here and besides the camera I
actually reckon we are done packing
right now so when it does come to
sorting out what to take with you please
always remember that less is more and
you don't need to take things like
shampoo conditioner even micellar water
and stuff like that which is very heavy
because the cost of you having a heavy
suitcase is a lot more than spending
five dollars on your bottle of shampoo
or conditioner probably the biggest
Havel hat but I have you guys if you are
going trampling the chance of you buying
anything while you're traveling is quite
high so 100% recommend that you at least
have a bit of a gap in your suitcase
somewhere so you can actually put things
in your suitcase when you actually need
to so right now I have quite a few gaps
on this side of my bag so if I do go out
and buy you clothes or definitely have
room for it so yeah I will definitely be
doing a little bit of a Primark haul if
you guys would like to see me make one
of those see if you guys did enjoy this
style of pack with me I know it was a
little bit weird and a little bit casual
and I hope you guys didn't mind that it
wasn't very professional I would be so
happy to do what's in my carry-on bag so
please let me know if you'd like to see
that because I'd love to do that and I
hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you
all very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
