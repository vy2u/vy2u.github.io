never filmed it story time here before
and I've never filmed the classes on a
Thursday is a date of first for sure so
this is something that I was talking
about on Twitter a little bother and a
lot of you were like daddy you need to
make a full video about this because I
was just killing so many stories it was
something that I couldn't talk about a
little while ago it's still quite fresh
and everything but today's stories that
video is about my old job when I started
YouTube I was still working at this job
until I need about 150 hours and that's
when I quit and became a full-time
youtuber so my old job was in a call
center and I was a supervisor of
complaints for a pizza company basically
people would call me up complaining that
their pizza was too hot it was I don't
know to cheesy when they ordered extra
cheese and I would get cold every single
soild you can ever imagine by these very
angry people with that angry basis but I
have a few stories about working in a
call center which I think you might find
quite amusing so I was about 18 19 when
I worked at this call center the whole
purpose of me working there was to save
up for a continued trip it was a really
good paying job of course courses
normally ah definitely when someone
calls me and they're in a call center I
talk to them very differently now that I
used to work more that's for sure if you
get called by someone in a closer or
you're calling up someone like an
insurance company and energy provider a
phone company whatever if you're someone
who gets very irritated very frustrated
and very nasty to those people you may
notice that you're put on hold or it
goes mute a lot more than it would if
you're being nice and there is a big
risk when it comes to call centers the
angrier that you are and the nastier
that you are the more that your person
on the other end of the phone is likely
to hold your call or meet your call and
talk about you to the rest of that I
colleagues it is just a coping mechanism
a lot of them don't want to have to call
you to ask you if you want
Genoa charity whatever they're doing it
cuz it said job so if you answer the
phone and you started using them and
call them all sorts of names they have
to take that and deal with it so a lot
of people dealt with it by putting
caller on mute and just being like ah
one of my stories from this place was
one of my last shift this happened and
it was just oh my goodness it was a
nighttime shift so getting a lot of
angry callers I get someone on the phone
for like an hour straight waiting on a
call because they bought a pizza three
days ago they left it in the fridge and
they ate it three days later and said it
doesn't taste the same and they want a
refund look like what people call me
like so angry economy like the worst
where you can imagine and they just like
why is this so much cheese on my pizza
this is so disgusting
look at that order and I'm like I'm
sorry did you realize that you ordered
extra cheese on your order I know but I
didn't want this much cheese I'm just
like one of my last shift and I was this
customer who was just being so so so so
abusive on the phone it was something
like her order was about five minutes
late or something and she just caught up
and sounded like abusing one of the
lower down course and they're people
that just take the orders so they pass
it up to us in the supervisor section
and my friend took the call this lady
starts going absolutely berserk and she
is just swearing and swearing and
swearing and saying the nasty stuff I
definitely can't repeat on YouTube why
are you abusing my friend on the phone
for a long long time and she's just
sitting there like yeah and the hot
thing was that you had to give him sort
of a warning if they were using really
abusive language and all of our calls
were recorded as well so
couldn't obviously like to talk facts
there anything like that which is very
hard and you'll get a confused but you
just had to literally put on a straight
face and be like I'm really sorry I
really understand we're trying get this
fixed for you Lola
to which this woman just said something
really disgusting for my friend on the
phone that she's a lowlife I'm just
gonna get down were in lycra shorts the
cool center of our aura and you can see
my friends face they're starting to get
really really really worked up at this
point getting really upset so she says
to the customer well I just have to put
you on home for two seconds I'm just
gonna call a delivery driver to see
where he is presses the whole button
that she sits that she looks at me and
she just goes when will this be female
dog would ever learn to shut up she's
the most annoying person I've ever
spoken to and she's just going on and on
and on venting and ranting which is
quite a normal thing to what she's
sitting there and she's just absolutely
going off into like thin air and I just
see on her face all of a sudden she's
kind of like and then the other of the
phony half woman saying darling
I'll shut up when I want to shut up and
she just was like oh my god I was just
thinking like no like no you didn't even
put her on hold I was just thinking like
oh that was absolutely insane and of
course she lost a job that our calls are
recorded you don't even want to know how
often that happens of course there's
people just like rage because they're
just so angry but we're all human like
we have to get it out somehow and if
someone's absolutely abusing you it is
very hard to stay calm and collected
even though of course you know we always
do we were trained to be that way but um
oh my goodness I felt so bad bitch like
you'd be sitting there and you just felt
like you were being dragged down to hell
and receive the time that firemen bring
you like not again and one of the worst
things with me is that I never learnt
the is it phonetic alphabet I never
learned that in school
like try and spell something out for me
I would get it back to him I would just
make up my art like HFO did it
there's she's like k4 cat I was like I'm
sorry ma'am cat is in Co T it's just
I've never done okay for cats
so do it also like K for King or C
chocolate no no no no no I told you UK
for cat
so it's pretty damn okay anyway like you
know like KitKat oh my god one of those
common things of course is a
accidentally getting disconnected from
the piece of Cola definitely story of my
life was like having a chocolate bar in
front of me and taking a big fat bite
out of it when I think that the calls
are like really quiet and then Dean both
drinking I figured out but I have to
tell the bar my mouth a month well I
really like what we're trying so hard to
like slowly talk about what I thought
enjoy the day more see something that
less they're like eating when you call
us
terrible also I'm sure many of you who
work in a call center would like to this
with me it's about you know a minute
until you can finally clock off or your
man is just like hey do you leave early
and you're like yes what you're seeing
there and you're thinking please don't
call me please uncle Reapers are the way
there's no way and of course that last
minute of your shift you have to get the
world's of longest phone call it was
just always that last call will be the
one call to ask you like every single
question that could ever think of and
every single query in the world it was
like I just want to go home cry
definitely if you ever talk to someone
working in a call center please know
that if you say anything nice to the
person on the phone whether it's just
you and you've been really helpful thank
you so much have a great day to dinner
to death it changes our day like so much
I don't think people realize like how
abused people and Coulson is gay
every single file to actually speak to a
customer and he's really nice and it's
like oh I have a lot of a shift or hello
good night whatever makes such a
difference and the complete opposite to
my job now every time I'm on camera I
have to be glammed up like just me wear
eyeglasses today is like a massive thing
for me because I kind of feel like call
centers are amazing for looking like
crap I mean we would have like a uniform
policy obviously at our job because
every job does but in the day you're
like but why I think no one can see me
it was just the best thing we see
they're like messy fun like trackies and
just things so Christ and getting away
with it's like one of the only jobs you
can let you get away with things but in
all seriousness I have nothing but
respect and love for all of you that
work in call centers because I know what
it's like the culture that I worked and
had a lot of different companies in
there so we sat very close to insurance
companies and the other ones that were
calling you and you know ask you if you
want stuff which is which over time they
get absolutely screamed in yoga I was
very lucky that I had inbound calls
people would call me I wasn't calling
out words the thing is seriously matter
like grown men that I still get up from
my chairs in the insurance department
and just cry and walk around crying
because I just got so be used it's so
heartbreaking see if you do get a call
from a course and I always be nice to
them unless they're being nasty then you
don't have to be nice but if I just
sound like a general job or whatever
always be kind it makes a world of
difference I hope you guys enjoy the
story time I mean if you do work and of
course innovate some funny experiences
of yours below I'd love to hear anything
I've said it's relatable to you or
similar in your workplace so I hope you
guys enjoyed this it was really fun to
create a story time video it is my first
one ever and I would love to do some
more funny story time videos in the
future
I'll see all of you very soon I love you
so much and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
