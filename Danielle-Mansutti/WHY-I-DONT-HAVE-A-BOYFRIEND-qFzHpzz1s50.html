channel we have not done actual a in
like ever I'm really excited to have a
look at them because I asked you to send
non beauty related questions today I
just report on into the Q&amp;amp;A if you are
not part of our family or experience
these subscribe button below you not do
I love you to be part of our family
welcome you with open arms and squeeze
you and hug you and give you lots of
love so let's go into the questions I
hope you guys enjoy someone has asked me
why I'm single um why am i single a bad
thing to be single like if you are
single it's actually really fun
especially at my age like I'm very happy
being single and just doing what I want
and not having to rely on anyone that
makes sense
I know many of you from eating really
happy relationships and I'm more than
happy for you and in a way I'm stupid
jealous of you as well I wish you had
someone to cuddle and love and all kind
of stuff but I'm happy being single I
really don't mind it personally I'm
someone that doesn't want to jump into
any form of relationship unless I know
that I want to be with that person for a
long time it's nice it's just what if I
can get to know guys and on dates not
kind of stuff but you always know if
there's something a little bit not right
or whatever I don't want to jump into
anything until I'm like 100% sure so
back why do I think it's gonna happen
for a long time because I feel like for
what I do for work and everything I need
to find someone who is really accepting
of it really supportive with it and
wants to be involved with it as well it
isn't like freaked out but like a lot of
guys are I think it's just because of
the age that I'm going for but a lot of
guys seem to be very sort of like
freaked out by my independence if that
makes any sense so they see that you
don't really like need them and they're
like oh what's the point but for me in a
future relationship I just want a
companion who is supportive and there
for me and we're like a little duo and
we help each other out and we
unconditional love each other and all
that kind of stuff and then is extremely
hard to find so I'm quite happy to be
single for a long time until I find that
so there's nothing wrong with being
single
it just means that you are sort of
waiting for years oh that's a good way
well if you were given 24 hours to live
what would you do what I do I would tell
people that I love them I would tell
people how much they meant to me and all
that kind of stuff that you get too
scared to do when you are not about to
die I would spend my last hours with my
family because obviously like my mom my
dad my brother are the most important
with my life so I would definitely
swimmer ask me for hours with them and
Coco of course literally weeks I'm sure
we've all been in this kind of situation
before like when you love someone but
you never told them and I've been in
that situation before so I can we tell
people that don't know that like I have
to love them to bits and they were
amazing it changed my life
what kind of stuff you can't just go to
do that when you are not about to die
because you are very scared of just
being WETA is so I just think I would
spend it with my family what something
sweet you like someone to do you okay
this is really weird I've actually sales
on snapchat before a lot of people might
find it like bizarre I'm definitely
someone that values like thoughtfulness
over materialistic things about if
someone came over like a picnic basket I
was like let's go out for lunch I've
made us all this lunch and I brought
your favorite things that are dinner
that means so much to me taking me like
a really fancy expensive restaurant I'm
like that's really generous of you but I
don't know if I've except like the
thoughtfulness of the first thing just
means so much more to me one thing that
make really happy that someone could do
is just be really thoughtful whether
that's writing a letter making a little
photo album sending me song and telling
me reminds them of me anything like that
like I just like the little things in
life because I just mean so much what's
your favorite thing about meeting us and
what's one thing you find scary about it
like never we see a number on the screen
of however many people it may be that is
subscribed to and you're like well
that's a really big number but then you
think wait they're actually individual
people and you meet them you're like oh
my god that you are amazing I will
always value my relationship with my
subscribers so much because you you let
me do what I do you know I wouldn't be
here if you weren't
to me weren't supporting me it does wait
so much when you say hi to me I used to
get like no good acts when people was
there out of me because I was so scared
of coming across like in bad way because
I'm quite shy but I've learned to just
sort of like transition completely into
being super like happy and confident
when you guys approach me because I
don't want to come across as like you
know a rude person because I don't want
that at all I just thought I'm like to
go with sometimes you know you overthink
things in your head but it's actually
not as bad as in person as you think it
is like if you stumble over words I
think oh my god are we thinking like oh
how embarrassing for whatever but they
probably have no idea sir yeah I do get
nervous too when you guys say hi and it
makes me feel nervous that you're
nervous it's like this little cycle
there's been some girls that have come
up to me and they're like shaking it
like what are you doing I'm just such a
boring person I like hug them tight I'm
like we can shake together what did you
go to I can't be bothered cooking dinner
ever since I moved out every single
night is that I can't be but it's going
tada it's so bad it's like baked beans
on toast a lot to fake beans on toast
Tran salad that's like my number one I
just empty kind of tuna put it in a bowl
like lettuce tomato cucumber
I need that they'd be like by itself or
in a wrap or something but every lazy
it's one thing I really have to actively
change would you ever get another dog
definitely it's something which is a big
priority for me right now living alone
I'm just seeking out a approval from my
landlord to see if I can or cannot have
a dog but I'm looking into adopting an
ex-racer greyhound because they're
desperately new homes and if you do have
a home to offer for a greyhound then
please do it I wish I went to like an
open adoption day down the Ballarat and
got to meet like so many greyhounds and
they are such a gorgeous breed and
they're so lazy it is perfect because
I'm home all the time I see like little
companion
also for you know emotional support my
therapist always recommended that having
a dog for emotional support is
incredibly helpful so in the process of
sort of working out if I can if I can't
all that but a hundred percent I'm
traveling what about September but then
when I'm back I want to look into it if
all is good and that concludes the
questions for today or if you guys
enjoyed it got to know a few sneaking
things I'll see you all very soon I love
you all so much bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
