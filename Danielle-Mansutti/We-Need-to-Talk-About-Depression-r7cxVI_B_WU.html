is a little bit different than my normal
videos and it is currently 5 p.m. I'm
hoping that I don't remember on for too
long because the Sun will disappear I
just want to sit down my bedroom with
you because we need to talk about
depression we need to talk about mental
illness we need talk about mental health
I have a platform of so many of you that
it baffles me why I don't talk about
this more because if anyone watches this
and ever feels like they can relate to
this or it helps to understand what
they're going through
it just means absolutely everything to
me
unfortunately the stigma around
depression is not dealt with in a
healthy or ideal way within our society
you say the words depression and
instantly you feel like strange because
it's such a taboo word and it's
something which you feel like is so like
crazy and out there and everything it's
not spoken about in a very smart and
healthy way publicly and openly and
that's something that I want to do today
I want to hopefully discuss it with you
and honestly if you have feelings of
depression if you deal with mental
illness talk about it like we're
discussing it now even if it's just
right and comment below let's talk about
it you know the best way to disarm that
voice in your head is to acknowledge
that it's there and say take it fresh in
here you go back again you know it's so
important to be open and honest about it
especially with those around you so they
understand what's going on with you and
I hope it really gets the point one day
where it is as open and easy as saying
to someone I have a cold right now to
tell them you know I'm really depressed
right now a very important statistic
that I must open this video with which
is quite alarming to me
and something which I've discovered the
research but I do on depression mental
illness and that is the fact that in
Australia suicide is the leading cause
of death right now especially in men in
our society in Australia it's very
common for men to being is sort of like
a low-key environment where they're
surrounded by the boys and Sport and
beer and being
match a man everything a guy like that
going through depression feeling
comfortable opening up to his friends
about it if you can that is amazing but
so many men feel like they can't talk
about it because it shows a sign of
weakness and ultimately it has led to
being the leading cause of death in
Australia and it baffles me that it is
because you don't hear anything about it
it's such a taboo hidden away swept
under the rug kind of statistic we need
to talk about it we need to talk about
what's going on why this is happening
and why depression and mental illness is
rising in our society as well I've
recently listened to a lot of podcasts
about depression anxiety mental illness
I found that listening to psychologists
and listening to research has really
helped me to understand it and I've
written down a lot of points which
really stuck out at me and show me to
pass on to you guys today so a lot of
what I'm saying is referencing a
psychologist quote because I feel
obviously they they know what they're
talking about I'm not a trained
professional take everything I said over
Pinscher soul just remember I'm just a
normal human being I just talk about my
experiences but don't take me as the
right advice or anything like that
because I'm not a trained professional
and if you are struggling then please go
and see a trained professional not a
youtuber like me
so depression is a disorder it can be
seen in various ways it is a disorder of
energy
we literally have no energy you can't
get up in the morning you will force
yourself but you can't get up you have
no energy at all to do anything it is a
disorder of your brain you are lacking
like neurotransmitters in your brain
things aren't quite worrying of
accurately so it ultimately becomes a
disorder for brain as well and it is a
disorder of attention your mind is
constantly wandering around you have a
lack of focus and you are kind of
anticipate in the future in a really
negative way which goes hand in hand
with anxiety so you will find yourself
in conversation with people be you're
only half there like you want there you
just sort of like the shell of who you
are but whatever is inside of you is
absent at that point and it is quite
obviously people to see that I become so
comfortable with my family now that I
will quite happily tell them I'm feeling
so out of it right now I'm feeling so
depressed please don't take anything I
do personally also heart because someone
can be talking to you and you literally
just can't even look at them in the eye
and hear them because you are somewhere
else that ultimately depression is a
disorder of your life it's commonly
linked to the fact that your brain is
telling you that you are not fulfilling
the once it needs it slinked the fact
that you're not living the life that you
want and in a way when you get triggered
by something and your depression hits
you again sometimes it's valuable to
actually listen to it maybe my
depression is telling me that my
lifestyle isn't working for me if it's
happening to offer me sometimes maybe
listen to it and think what can I change
with my life like am i working too hard
am I in the wrong place right now have I
got the wrong friends I hear the voice
sometimes and think what does it want
those that are quite vulnerable to
getting depression it can be from so
many different variables it could be
really really bad upbringing we've
internalized being critiqued by someone
whether that's a parent for me it's from
being bullied and it's from the negative
comments that I get every day it can be
a lot of factors and sometimes you
recognize that the voice that's inside
of your head isn't yours the voice
inside your head is the internalized
version of those that have put you down
made you feel worthless and they just
revolve around your head constantly I've
always been a sensitive person my mom
and mine are very sensitive as well it's
just where we are as a family being
bullied throughout my entire high school
life and reading um negativity about
myself almost every single day online
about my personality and my appearance I
can shrug it off I can ignore it I can
block it when you read so much of that
it does stick with you
unfortunately subconsciously to the fact
that yeah I hear these voices but I know
they're not mine and I have to just be
like okay these are just voices that my
brain is trying to sort of file away
hopefully and get rid of for those
voices I really have to just ignore as
best as I can because they're the kind
of voice that push you over the edge a
little bit they're making really things
that aren't true and you need to just
turn them off and not listen to them I
was recently listening to a podcast and
a clinical psychologist called Emily
toner was talking about sort of like the
triggers of depression and anxiety and
it just was so accurate I felt that I
had to convey to you guys because I just
related to it so much
commmentating factor in depression and
anxiety something called experiential
avoidance so basically an avoidance of
your internal experience you don't want
to think about what's going on in your
mind if you don't know experience
emotions that your body's feeling and
you find any way that you can to
distract yourself from that and I find
that avoidance 3 is something which
shows me that I'm not coping very well
it's so it is just goes hand in hand
with when I'm feeling depression I will
avoid so much in my life I will avoid
cleaning my house at my house ultimately
becomes very messy and it is such a
linking fantage when I'm down my
environment kind of reflects upon that
and is very messy I find that I try and
avoid filming because I will show you
the pain that I'm going through today
I've got to sit down and film three
videos I went to film makeup tutorials
Halloween tutorials and I sat there and
I literally sat there for two hours and
I couldn't do it I just I couldn't do it
because I did not feel in that zone and
it's not that I was avoiding it I just
knew that it wouldn't be the quality it
should be and I thought well why am i
what's a girl talking about this like
why am i pushing this behind me I don't
know like there's something wrong with
me and I said let's just discuss it and
that's that's what I've decided to do
today instead of filming like a
Halloween tutorial as many of you know
this is a lot more important to me than
a makeup tutorial because I feel we need
to change the way the world talks about
mental health we need to discuss it and
we need to understand why it's happening
and white rising at such an alarming
rate as well the speed of society to the
world that we live in today is a massive
link to the rise in depression and the
rise in anxiety and other mental
illnesses we live in such a bizarre
society compared to you know a few
decades ago what we live in now is just
so fast-paced we are constantly
surrounded by media we are constantly
surrounded by comparing ourselves to
others and comparing our lives others
agree most of us do
we'll put our lives out there on social
media to kind of portray a happier and
more fulfilling life than we actually
are
we will share photos of healthy food and
exercising in holidays and starts with
friends being happy but that might not
actually reflect what's going on that's
just the edited version of your
existence which you want portraying out
into the world to show them what you
want them to believe that you are and
then we see that we believe that it's
real but in anything but my words not
like that you know why is everyone else
seeming to have such perfect lives and
then we find ourselves so disconnected
from the world and it's such a common
link in all these issues
the partnership with depression is
disconnection and to be honest
connection is the most fundamental drive
for human beings it's a research that
I've read and listen to a studies
actually shown that social rejection is
experienced exactly the same way in the
brain as physical pain the human brain
believes that social connection is just
as important as physical survival and
when we experience a disconnect from the
world or from our society or from social
media and we feel as though we are
different and something that's wrong
with us we end up in this vicious cycle
it's very present and it's not spoken
about a lot we kind of ignore that it's
happening and technology it can be a
really great thing like for my parents
they use it to connect with their
friends but technology can also
disconnect you as well
and I find that it does for me because
my job is online and I can only show you
a portion of who I am I can show you the
version of me that I want you to believe
that I am is sort of more bubbly and
happy version of myself and I don't want
to sit around and discuss all my
problems and my issues with you all the
time because a lot of people will just
be like oh or she'll just complain and
whinge and they're not interested in
that
it's always like a healing process to
talk about it and to discuss it if you
feel like you are someone dealing with
issues with depression you need to talk
to someone leaving it all inside and
keeping it all internal will do nothing
but torture yourself and make it so much
worse to connect with another human
being whether it's a psychologist or a
friend you trust or a parent it releases
so much if that pain you have inside of
you it in your head and it is so
important to talk
I honestly encourage all of you if you
are struggling to talk about it because
it could save your life at the end of
the day if I got honestly could save
your life I've seen a psychologist and
they're absolutely incredible they
change your thought process and help you
understand mental illness and more of a
scientific way and you understand the
connections and the triggers as to why
it's specifically attacking you the way
that it is it's something which is just
so important and something which I
struggle with and I'm struggling with
right now
when as I call it my parents the
depression wave comes along I have to
just ride it out
and it sucks it sucks because there
isn't a way to turn it off it's hard
because you know it's happening and
you're know you're behaving different
way you know that you're being
disconnected and you're being out of
focus and almost rejectable to those
around you but you can't stop it and
it's horrible and for me my depression
waves I can last anywhere from like one
week it's like three months like it just
depends on the situation
and it's so unexpected for me sometimes
and so annoying because it interferes in
my daily life it interviews my
friendships it interferes with my work I
can't get out of bed I can't move I have
no energy to do anything and that voice
in my head
I mean the most terrible things that I
shouldn't listen to and I am someone
that is alone I live alone I tend to be
by myself a lot which I don't really
mind play enjoy my own company and I'm
an introvert and enjoy my own time but I
don't have that feeling of having
someone there for you all the time to
cuddle in love or whatever but a very
important factor in this is that I still
felt like this when I was in a
relationship because the relationship
that I was in I was still completely
disconnected from because the values and
things that I wanted out of it weren't
there so there isn't like an instant
cure and you shouldn't just depend on
other people to make you happy it all
comes from within and you will need to
discover express for you and it is the
question of meditation verse medication
meditation is something that people have
told me for years now to try and do and
I just haven't done it because I haven't
found the right place to do it and I am
going to start doing it really soon and
I really hope that it will help me I've
recently started eating extremely
healthy and exercising every day that is
helping my body image but it isn't an
insecure for depression but you will
feel obviously better within yourself IB
endorphin rush you get after exercising
it's just like amazing you feel amazing
afterwards so I would definitely
recommend looking into exercising and
eating clean as well so this video today
it's just an open discussion about the
issues that we have and sort of working
out why it's happening where it's coming
from and hopefully someone that watches
this will relate to this will feel like
I kind of understand where you're coming
from and will hopefully help you because
that's that's the main thing that I want
from this I want to help you I want I
don't want you to feel alone because I
know that feels I am just making this
because I really
help you and I really want to make sure
that you're okay and in a way it can
sound like I'm kind of talking to myself
because if this is a video dough for me
to watch myself but I just think we need
to change the stigma revolving around
mental illness we need to discuss it we
need to be open and I really hope that
you will finish this video today sort of
seeing it a different way if you have a
close friend or family member that has
depression now it helps you to
understand them a little bit better it's
just someone which is so important so
close to my heart that I just had to sit
down today and make a video about this
so I don't really have a sense of I just
want to say that if you are struggling
right now please remember that you have
survived every single bad daddy you've
ever had up to this point and you're so
strong and should be so proud of
yourself just remember I will always be
here for you and I will continue to make
videos like this to help others but
please remember you are enough you are
strong and I love you so thank you so
much for watching today and we'll have a
discussion in the comments bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
