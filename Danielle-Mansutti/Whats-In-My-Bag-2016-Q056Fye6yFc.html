today's video I am finally doing my very
first what's in my bag video I've never
done this kind of video before and I'm
very excited so today because it's just
something completely different for me
from all the videos that I've watched
with other people doing a what's in my
bag video I've been very intrigued to
see that they seem to have Mary poppin
bags where they just keep pulling things
out again and again they get again and
I'm like well I don't know about you
guys who else agrees with me when it
comes to having a handbag I have this
one which is my only designer handbag
and I got this recently for my New York
trip because I was going on business
meetings and stuff like that I was
getting a little bit yeah about using my
$5 Kmart handbag I buy my upgrade and I
got a Michael Kors bag I don't know the
actual name of this I just know that
it's pretty yeah I only use it for like
important things because I'm not a
brands person or the designer person
Matt can you tell them my clothes I
bought it from Target I use display
business meetings and travel and
important stuff I don't really use every
day but this is my go-to bag and because
of that I switched between this bag and
like my old $5 came up bag when I go out
and stuff like that because I would not
want to take this bag out I would be
like guarding it with my life like oh
I'm back to what I was saying when it
comes to watching other youtubers what's
my bag the videos I'm just like do you
never get home and take stuff out of the
bag because I don't know about you but
when I get home
whatever's in my bag I take it out and
put it away it's that weird so I feel
like I'm the only person YouTube it does
that because it runs like here's a snack
from three months ago in my bag and I'm
like what let's get into talking about
what's in the bag because that's what
this whole video is about where my hands
are complete different color to my face
today day yeah I got this big size
because I wanted to use it more sorry
for traveling though my carry-on on the
plane because it actually is big enough
that it can fit
my laptop inside so in the bag itself
there is like a little zip compartment
in the middle and then there's chick
parts on the other side they both have
zips and they both have little places
you can pick your phone and all that
good stuff so I just go back from
shopping
I haven't emptied my bag yet so I
thought perfect time to actually show
you what's in here when I am out and
about and what not just emails in my bag
is my purse this is a mink coat purse
if you don't know what Minko is anyone
in Australia will know when googas video
feed you don't know because it's just
like a thing that we are obsessed with
over here everyone loves min-cart'
and they do lots of like rose gold stuff
like this and beautiful iced espresso
absolutely everything normally if I'm
going out for shopping or sink friends
or some like that I will just take this
in my phone then we have my kingly
jangling car keys so on my little car
peak hearing obviously there's a car key
then I have my house keys my pea box key
and my garage key box my car keys
Wow so interesting the next thing we
have is in this little compartment on
the side and it is my phone this is my
phone and this is my phone case as you
guys know from my video on Saturday
which is my Q&amp;amp;A or Friday problem this
is my focus and you can now officially
apply this phone case on Danny very calm
so we have this one we have the hug love
case and we also have the if it ain't
black put it back on the rack phone case
we have very limited stock of these
phone cases and we will not be
restocking and once they have been sold
so you should jump on to Danny baby
store calm right now and go and get them
so if you haven't seen my QA this is the
puggle of case it is so cute and I drew
this little plug on it it's like one
that I have on my focus right now is

actually a watercolor sort of tie-dye
print and then we have the if it ain't

this mini sized Too Faced better than
sex mascara so perfect for the head bag

spray and also fun fact if you get
mosquito bites like I do all the time
put this on the mosquito bite and it
will stop the itching right away as a
sodium in it which stops the edges the
best then I have this Kiko lip enhancer
