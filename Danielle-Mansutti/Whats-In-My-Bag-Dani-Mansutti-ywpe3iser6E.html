so excited because I have not filmed a
what's in my bag video in so long I feel
like I was a baby last time I did it's
insane so I figured today I will show
you what's in my bag it's quite full
today and I call this my Mary Poppins
bag because it mounts up I can fit in
here is ridiculous well attempt to fit
as you can see the zip is currently
struggling to close I just got back from
London as well so I thought I would show
you exactly what's in here for like a
full kind of day trip and everything
like that all my essentials and
everything in between and I haven't
snuck anything in there to pretend that
it's like oh my god this is another Gwen
it's not because I'm not like that by
doing it's all my boring crap this in my
bag and before we get right into it if
you're not ready screw out my channel I
would love to have you in our little
family upload two videos every single
week I would love to have you here and
if you want to find out exactly what is
in here then just keep watching
I guess at the start you have to kind of
say like this is my bag it is a business
so my back like $20 I guess I got it
from sports girl back when I lived in it
Australia and I really liked it it's
like it was pretty decent size and it's
not - icarly's everything like it's so
expensive and so fancy cos one day I
will get really nice design a bag but
that day is not yet here this says we
pretty well I guess some people kind of
look at me sometimes like you're going
to mating with a backpack on like a
youth 12 in a month
guys please let me Blues up in the back
pocket first the biggest section here
actually when I did buy this I thought
this was a zipper at the bottom as well
turns out it was just a disappointment
here is how the inside of my bag looking
it's so what's ridiculous and the first
thing that we have is my
tangle teezer that I use like all the
time on my hair I can't use a normal
hair brush after using these hair
brushes they are just a little bit like
I'm selling my hairbrush at least like
to use this is so weird this is gonna
get real personal then of course we have
my iPhone I have an iPhone 7 plus and I
have like a really weird transparent
cover on it which I can't into clean for
some reason it's just like dirty and
gross I got the cover from test
first a few pounds next we have got my
house keys I wish I could say car keys
but you girl doesn't have a car in
England and oh my god drugs means hey I
miss having it God so much got my little
Tesco Clubcard I might as well this is
really keep my mum gave this to me when
I moved to England and I put on my keys
and it just says with you always
I love mum it's got a little porker in
the back I mean it's cute makes me sad
sometimes I'm like oh yeah the essential
I would never have this in the bag in
Australia but hello Jess I told you it's
Mary Poppins bag equip - this out like
bigger than the bag itself I've learned
since moving here it is quite a good
idea to keep a umbrella in your backpack
or in your handbag because it is quite
necessary
like when I just went to London it's
like sunny outside as you can see that
sounds like coming through the window
and it just started raining and it's
sunny and I'm like what
so it is always a good idea to carry an
umbrella in England that's for sure
we have perfume this is the Jo Malone
mimosa and cardamom if you watched my
videos you're like oh you've used this
before and this is the same bottle that
I have used before but I'm so precious
about my perfume here there did you want
to say I'm so precious about my perfume
that I hardly ever use my nice-lookin so
I had this with me cos had a very
important meeting when I was in London
so I thought I would but she thinks
every single time but I suspect I think
she thinks he's gonna go for a walk see
she's like mom's making it up - small
knife you must be leaving now baby
smells so good I love Jo mine so much
next I have my purse this is from
bershka I think it was 5 pounds and I'm
going this the zip broke off today so I
can't open it without going like this
with my hand to open it I thought the
zip like trapped inside I've no idea
what the end does
gone but yeah it's like awkward they
open it with my finger now which is a
bit of a nightmare on the truth I just
have my various cards and everything a
few receipts I don't know why I still
have dollars in here from America ever
since I went in like July I don't know
why I haven't it bothers check than that
yet and I've got some cash money making
it rang with my ten pound note all I
have in here actually here receipts this
is a receipt from June for a plan what
why do I keep these things I don't like
why I don't know about many interesting
things in here oh my god I completely
forgot I actually keep change in the
middle up here
do you know about times I just think
that's why I changed oh my god I
completely forget that actually have
money in here well that explains why
it's so happy what am I so dumb
sometimes but I do need to buy a new
purse cause you know this one's fallen
to bits so that's my purse thank you
then I have a two-for-one pizza Express
voucher says a lot about me doesn't it
so I just went to a Knicks event for
their new contour palette so I have
these in my bag you can't see what she's
actually looking at like can I have one
ma'am you don't need to come till you're
ready beautiful as you are don't ya okay
we'll get into the depth of the first
now we have some hand sanitizer which is
essential I've become a little bit of a
germaphobe that or do I get especially
when I'm on the tube and you only have
to touch like the rail holes you don't
fall over every time I have to touch it
I'm like oh and I have some chewing gum
okay very interested in this moving on
oh my god I have I have some photo booth
photos from revolution bar with my
friend Amy every single time the
photobooth would actually take a photo
the flash would go off she posed but
then they actually took the photo like a
second afterwards so every symbol I
don't we're pulling like the biggest
joke places in the world
I'm just like it also photos so there's
that and then we have my earphones of
course tangled actually not tangle

charger and then I have this oh god I
