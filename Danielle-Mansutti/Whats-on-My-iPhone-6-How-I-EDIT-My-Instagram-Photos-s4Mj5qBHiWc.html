channel in today's video we are doing
the or what's on my iPhone video as well
as how I edit my Instagram photos you
guys have been asking for this for so
long and it's finally yeah so just
looking at my phone I do have an iPhone
6 I just have the normal one should
probably wipe the fingerprints off it
I have the iPhone 6 I couldn't go to the
iPhone 6 plus or the big one whatever
the big one is called because it was too
big I just couldn't even like hold it
wasn't comfortable my hand so I have the
little baby six one and I have dropped
it and smashed it that many times
because I am very dumb and don't have a
cover so I definitely recommend that you
guys should use a cover for your phone
and as you can see on the side of the
screen I have a nice little quote which
says work hard dream big because you
know inspiration in the morning when I
look at my phone the first thing that
I'm going to show you guys today is best
fiends I have seen this everywhere and
then best fiends that she contacted me
to try and play the game and see if I
liked it and I got addicted very fast so
I'm going to show you guys because you
need to download this game it is so much
fun if you ask someone like me who
travels a lot or has a lot of time to
waste when you're waiting around for
things and this is one less addictive
game she's just like the best you can
see I'm on level livid you guys did a
gory and see if you can beat me as soon
as you can so check out the link in the
description to download this game on
Google Play or the App Store obviously
I've got my from the App Store because
iPhone but the fact that it's free is
just another added bonus so you guys
should definitely check it out
so best fiends we have got good old
snapchat so this is all my snapchat
details if you do want to find me on
there I love snapchat so much but I kind
of feel like my stories of boring busted
because I'm watching myself I'm like so
boring then we have Spotify as well is
probably one of my most used apps
I am a Spotify addict I love it so much
so I'm pretty sure my Spotify name is
just Daniel Minh City one word and
pretty
so feel free to stalk me on there and
see what music I listen to you or more
mom and then of course one of my most
used apps of all time is YouTube so yeah
obviously I don't need to really show
you my YouTube account because you are
watching it right now so and then just
below that I've got my whatsapp and my
phone and what kind of stuff and I've
got my Gmail which I'm not really gonna
go into and show you my emails it was
sorry so let's go ahead and jump to the
bottom of the screen so as many of you
know one of my favorite social media
sites is Twitter however as you can see
it says Twitter did an update
I can't even access it anymore so I have
to access it through Safari now so
Twitter please do an update and fix this
ASAP it's like frozen we're going to
jump along to Instagram and as you guys
can see this is my Instagram page I will
show you how I edit my Instagram photos
in a second but of course oh what a babe
one way but of course I'm just going to
go through and like every single photo
well because it's mine not so we also if
you would come along and follow me on
Instagram as well and then I have my
Facebook app and my messages app not the
most interesting things for me to go in
and show you at all so let's get to the
fun part and let me show you how I edit
my Instagram photos so as you can see at
the bottom I've got three apps there a
wipe up camera good we should take your
phone on and then I have Avery facetune
and I call it visco I don't know why I
just look at vseo and in my head it says
Fiske oh but I'm probably so wrong it's
probably just pronounced vsco cam but
I'm going to call it visco because
that's the way that my brain reason
obviously once I've taken a photo on the
camera I will jump over to this app
called Avery so for example we
this photo here hello dear hello and
what I'm going to do is I firstly jump
onto the adjust tab and then on adjust I
will do the brightness and the contrast
and the exposure because this is a
little bit dark let's say that's all I
want to do for that then I will crop it
into a square has kind of crazy in this
photo isn't it
cool nice close-up of my face and then
we are going to go ahead and save it so
after we have done the lighting of
fixing and everything I'm going to jump
over to face tune and don't freak out no
I'm not going to make myself look like a
pancake with eyes you know people like
soap in their face so much it just looks
like literally a pancake with eyes your
leg what what is that so what I use face
chin for is stuff like whitening this is
something I do in like all my photos
it's something which a lot of you have
asked me for so long how I do it I do it
on face tune so I get the whitening tool
as you can see it is the second one on
the bottom of the tab and then I'm just
going to zoom in and I'm going to rub my
finger do it this way so you can see it
I'm just rubbing my finger all along the
background I'm going to widen it and so
don't get rid of all the yellow tones
that are sitting there in the background
as well so as you can see it's like
slowly this slowly slowly slowly getting
brighter and whiter and then I'm going
to do that side and then as you can see
it's now my hair so I'm just going to go
ahead and erase some of that what what I
like to do is I normally go right up
into my eyes very close and I'm using
the tab here called details which is
right in the middle and what I like to
do is I will just run my finger over my
eyes and my eyebrows and make them super
sharp and then go over here do the same
thing they do it on my teeth and then I
also go along and do it to my hair my
necklace all that kind of stuff as you
can see I haven't used like any
airbrushing I don't really like to do
that I like the fact that you can see
like I've got pimples there because I'm
a real person
you know to me I don't really like to
use that airbrushed thing too much
everything is I have a really baby
forehead sometimes sometimes I do use on
my forehead I'll be honest but I reckon
it's like a trick to do the details on
your eyes and your hair and your teeth
it makes your skin look softer in anyway
because it's not sharpened does that
make sense and then we jump into where
all the magic happens to good old vsco
cam or vsco cam now I'm just going to
jump into the bottom tab here the second
one there and then it brings up all the
filters my favorite filters are HB one
and HB 2 I use these pretty much every
single Instagram photo so let's say I go
to HB 2 I will then jump in the settings
and probably put the exposure down so
now just playing with the saturation
stuff like that just playing around with
the colors and contrast and what kind of
stuff I'm going to put on a bit of a
fade on this photo I see there it is
just to sort of soften it up a little
bit but that's just the basic gist of
how I do edit an Instagram photo and
then of course I will save it to my
cover all that kind of stuff so that is
the basic gist of how I edit my
Instagram photos it's super easy once
you do start doing it and it's just like
becomes a habit biggest thing for me is
the details on face tune and the
whitening tool and face tune and the SEO
can they're like my biggest things for
how I do edit my photos and sometimes I
do get a little bit like OTT with the
eye detailing Oh as you can see like
there it's like whoa but I don't know
that's just what I liked is what I think
is good so it's
whatever I'm going to shop my eyes crazy
amounts and that is basically what is on
my iPhone and how I edit my photos I
really hope you guys did enjoy seeing
that and enjoyed sort of learning with
the little tips and tricks I use for my
photos I mean the world to me if you
would follow my social media accounts
like my Instagram my Twitter even though
the Twitter wasn't working it would be
awesome if you guys come along and
follow me on there that's all for me
today I have a great day I'll be seeing
you all very very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
