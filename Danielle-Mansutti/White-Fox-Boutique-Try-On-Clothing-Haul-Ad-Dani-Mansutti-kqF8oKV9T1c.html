today's video we have got a white box
boutique cool and I'm so well she's not
very excited but I'm so excited about it
because as you guys know white fox we
take I like one of my favorite brands I
have done many video on Tron hauls
because I love their stuff I person
Instagram and stuff like all the time
it's insane
so when white box I'm contacting way to
make another try and haul video I was
just like y'all let's do it and I'm so
excited but so many clothes here I also
have a discount code for you stick
around to the end to see what that is to
save yourself some $1.00 I'm not free to
do and this time into it it's what I'm
excited about is I have such a big range
of clothes here as well I have
activewear I have like loungewear I have
dresses and I have like everyday stuff
there's a bit of everything I'm just
hoping that bangs doesn't sit night and
I guess it's everywhere so beanie know
when I try this on I was just like oh
this is beautiful
so this is the dress and it is just the
nicest fit I love the elastic I love the
material it's made out of because it's
just so flattering on your waist it is
such a nice nice dress and it's warm
because it's like thick material which I
love because I'm in winter right now so
I need lots of thick material because
he's freezing in England so cold
seriously so this is a definite winner I
love this dress and also just you know I
will link everything that I'm showing
you in this video in my description if
you want to find it to look at it
yourself go ahead next thing is that we
should address my shirt right now
because I love this shirt I mean Iran is
to find a lipstick which is exactly the
same shade I'm so happy about this shirt
is also from white box you take it is a
cut-off shirt it says honey on it and
it's red how the ly rare but I chose
this because I was just like oh I love
it
it looks so cool like high-waisted jeans
and speaking of high-waisted jean I
actually have some high-waisted jeans so
what I love about these jeans is the
unique little thing at the front so you
see how there's a tire the front there's
no buttons as no zips so there's no
struggle honestly these are like the
easiest jeans and they managed to get
myself into because it's a tire which is
something I
people might see a thing all that's
really weird it might get really low
throughout the day I wore these jeans to
an event about a week ago and they
stayed the whole time they were so
comfortable I ate so much of the event
so I've got super bloated and they
weren't uncomfortable at all they're
just kind of like extended as my belly
expand a little bit food as well I love
these jeans they are so so nice next we
have this cropped hoodie which also is
really cool with iOS jeans or with
active wear anything like that I chose
this just because I really love crops
hoodies I think that they're so nice for
gym wear as well especially when you're
in the kind of temperatures that I am
and users do not want to wear this
singlet to the gym I put this big
perfect
speaking of active wear let's move on to
the white box we take active boy which I
oh my god have fallen in love with so
much like honestly this is my favorite
stuff the thing is with active wear it's
really hit and miss sometimes we'd like
the sizing and the complet and then
actually working out and it like it can
look good by itself but is it practical
to workout in so I wore this black pair
to gym the other day and it was so
comfortable and I want the leggings out
in London that nights I had to go out
pop out to get my lashes lifted and I
wore those leggings and honest to god
and credible like so comfortable I also
got them in purple as well with the
white box the logo along the side so the
black one had it along the sides well
but in a different kind of font they're
so flattering as well especially cuz
they kind of suck you in at the waist
which is what I love I hate it when
they're like really baggy at the waist
and you're just like oh I'm not just
saying it for the purpose of this being
a sponsor video I genuinely love the
active way I could not recommend it to
you guys enough like it is so good
they've done an amazing job with it
seriously so good next I have this
little t-shirt dress with these ties on
the side I believe this is one of the
schönox so whitefox collaborations I
really like this I think it would look
so good with like black high boots as
well so first of all we have these bad
boys which are confused shoes in the
world
so these velvet boots and
have the zips down the side because the
heel isn't too big what I love about
this is that it's practical because you
can go out and wear them and look like
you're kind of dressing up or wearing
heels but it really doesn't feel like
you're wearing heels they're my favorite
kind of heels and while on the topic of
shoes I also got these higher up black
ones how gorgeous are these oh my god I
love this face love it I was just
looking to move on a very pale nor a
fake tan
that's why I look so white oh this face
is everything so I've seen these kind of
like silk to pieces all over Instagram
on like the really gorgeous girls like
tell me hambo wears this kind of stuff
all the time and I'm so happy to finally
have my own hands on it it'll be a lot
easier to show you in the cutscene but
the quality of this I cannot tell you
how nice it is and then this is like the
boob tube at the top so you actually tie
yourself at the top like it's just so
nice alright you guys have definitely
seen this away Instagram this gray
jacket I cannot tell you how many
compliments I got in this gray jacket
how many people ask me what's wrong so
many people love this when I wore it out
so I wore it to the toothpaste event
recently which you guys have seen again
on my Instagram and so many people
ordered at our hotel where I was from it
is the most comfortable nicest fake kind
of ish jacket I've ever seen in my life
seen I mean worn anything you guys are
gonna see you wear it a lot because once
I find a piece of clothing that I love
alright like every single day that's
what's gonna happen with this so moving
on to something a little bit more casual
this is also in the activewear part of
white fox
it is this jumper and the reason why I
love it is the sleeves the sleeves are
everything so this is like an oversized
jumper the comfiest things like
loungewear anything like that so this
next dress is just amazing I really like
the
like this it's very flattering against
my skin too and I find because it's not
too similar so doesn't wash me out
anything like that and honestly like I
love the fact that it's so flowy just
too elegant you feel like a little
princess in it like it's so nice I then
have another oversized kind of black top
jumper which you guys know is my kind of
thing like I love I love black I love
casual I love oversized stuff so I saw
this and I was like this is my last
piece of clothing from white box to show
you guys is this coat which is in a nude
color and it's a very long coat I mean
which I will feel very classy wearing
because I don't know any coats like this
myself so I chose it because I think it
would say the wintry weather that we're
in in England right now because it is
just so so so so nice so thick and just
so warm so I was like yes I am more than
certain you guys are gonna see me wear
this stuff everywhere
like honestly the next week and you can
get 15% off storewide on white fox we
take by using the code daddy very easy
to remember if you want to save some
money on anything I just showed you then
use that code you guys know I don't do a
whole lot of sponsor videos when I do do
want it is because I am obsessed with
the brand and I actually love it I can't
thank them enough for sending me these
clothes as well because I am in love
with them so let me know in the comments
what your favorite piece is whether it
be like active writer lounge wear
dresses shoes whatever your favorite
thing is let me know I'm so sorry my
hair is that she's so fluffy flying
everywhere I keep touching it I know
it's annoying for you guys cause I'm so
sorry but I don't have a greasy hair I
suppose so I will catch you guys in the
comments I can't wait to find out what
