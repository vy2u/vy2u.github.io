shrine hole this is by white box we take
you reached out to me and ask if we like
to collaborate again until you guys know
I'm like obsessed with white box we do
it was so hard to choose just it feels
like I love them on the website a little
bit of a theme happening there was a lot
of white and a lot of Navy so I kind of
mishmash and picked so much white for
summer because in Australia we are
leading into summer in case you didn't
know I also picked up a lot of key
Australian sunglasses as well if you'd
like to see it what I picked up from
white box we take then please keep
watching so here is the first item of
clothing this is a lace style dress and
I reckon I'm gonna get so much use out
of this in the summer I really like how
it's so light so it's a really good
summary dress as well it's lacy
beautiful it's got a lovely pattern and
it looks just so casual or you could
dress it up to look really nice though I
love this dress the next thing that I
picked I wanted this all along
look how beautiful this skirt is I
picked this get because as you guys know
there were a lot of black tops and I
feel like this will match any laptop
that I have it's so beautiful it is
elastic so it stretches to your body
Shea this is something I know next time
like I'm a hundred percent wearing
because I love it how many times I'm
gonna say I love it because I do I do I
really do now this is something I've
seen all over Instagram for so long I
finally have it this gorgeous Navy and
white blazer I absolutely love this
color and I love the white patterns well
this is gonna be like such a popular so
a dress I can already tell and when I
put it on it was surprisingly so
comfortable because the waist line is
elastic so just like this skirt it just
fits your body shirt because it's all
rich
however the only modification I would do
to it is I probably put a safety pin
here because it does have a lot of
boobage sorry if you're someone like me
and you're like wait where are my boobs
and you probably want to pin it up and
with
like I do just next I have these oh it's
just James they have little holes in the
nays 6 of dila and I absolutely do not
have white jeans I've always been really
scared of them because I'm like if I
wear them out and I gonna come home like
brown no nothing else just I walk
straight into that one didn't I
what I meant to say is that I was
wondering if you wear them out you come
back and maybe dirty I did wear these
out the other day I will these out to a
bar when I was up in Sydney and I love
them and look how clean they are
ridiculous hey this is the tiny little
slit in the name but I think you're just
use it a little bit of an edge next
thing I have is something quite similar
to the top style that I'm wearing today
except it's bright white this is a boy
just a little a white rock top it would
look story nice with a a parcel cluster
parcel with colored skirt I reckon the
best part about this guy's is that you
can wear a bra with it I know of the
most annoyingly my crop top sometimes is
that you go out and you feel a bit like
because you're not wearing a bra but
seriously if this one's awesome because
you can have protection I think this
works so over the skirt that I showed
you guys before they'd be a little match
made in heaven
the next thing I selected is this place
root this is something that I saw on the
website and the model wearing it looked
so gorgeous and I was like I would never
buy something stripy because I don't
think you guys would ever see me
moisturize I was a little bit scared
because like I said I'm kind of scared
of stripes I don't know why I used to
think that they make you look bigger but
so what I put this on my favorite thing
about the play suit is this cute tie in
the front and how it goes to the back as
well I think that it's really
sophisticated feminine and lovely next
thing I picked is this a lovely stretchy
top I completely forgot when I first put
it on the time that it's meant to go
over your shoulder so I was wearing it
like a really weird t-shirt but it is
meant to stretch down your shoulders
it's super stretchy it's really really
pretty and it's really simple that's my
favorite thing about it is that you
could just chuck this on with like a key
pair of shorts or something
just even like flip-flops and it was
looking so pretty for summer okay now
these shorts are so gorgeous
these white shorts are the nicest fit
there are a little bit stretchy at the
top but they are so nice one that on
they love these little what they called
but this is so cute it's really playful
really cute and definitely something
really good for clubbing I reckon next
is this crop top and being a coat hanger
right now this crop top is so pretty my
favorite thing about this crop top is
that I do have a few pop tops with this
cut at the front but at the back they
were so like thin and flimsy I love the
fact that this has a back I knew you
could tell but I kind of love things
with the backs Kurt this is like to mess
it bums up in my book I think I would
actually wear this with like a maxi
skirt all right but it would look so
pretty together
next I have these black shorts well the
only black thing that I picked well
what's going on face you're so pretty
I've disappeared but that's the whole
pretty because I love that there's sort
of like thrilled I love that that's
really different as well and just like
I've said with all their other stuff
Ritchie
next we have this gorgeous place suit
how pretty and girly is this this it's
just the prettiest little place suit if
I don't wear a lot of cleavage things
because I don't have huge so these kind
of cuts I love I think that like so much
any age can pull this off
22:12 you can wear this if you're 20 to
30 to 40 - maybe not age well maybe 80 -
if you're just like an awesome grandma
definitely think it's a lot of different
age ranges and the last item of clothing
is this Blaine what
see now this isn't cotton this is like a
really dressy fabric am i picking yeah
can you tell this package publicity I
don't know why I did that that's what
I'm basically saying is that this top
doesn't lose its shape because the
quality of it is so good I think this
the most perfect white tee to wear with
like black jeans big boots or something
cool like that and now it's time to
quickly show you all the key australia
sunglasses that I chose so base best
ones are to be a kitty sunglasses I love
them because they're just something so
different and quirky and really fun so I
definitely love the Kitty ones so the
next one are called kosher and always
stay away from circle frames because I
do have quite like a round circle face
these actually look pretty cool and
really fun so you guys know me quite
well you know that this is my favourite
style of sunglasses these are the key
Australian my girls and this is B purple
and black blonde and I appreciate it on
white box boutique I love the fact that
you can't actually see my eyes this
super reflective so cool and when you
wear them everything is like green you
think you pedal but everything's green
these next ones are called the circus
Alive sunglasses these are sort of like
an aviator style and they're so nice
this is something that I'm still scared
of wearing as well because they're quite
a circle but I do really like them and I
love the silver and blue I think that
it's so so pretty these next ones are
called sugar and spice and can we just
have a look at the marble pattern on
them like how cool is that I've never
ever in my life seen sunglasses that
look like this I think that's so cool
they're so different as well and unique
that I think they're a great thing to
choose on the website finally we have my
girls yet again this is the silver
version which I'm pretty sure it's only
a white box boutique as well and I
really like these I think that they
would work with like any color item of
clothing that you're wearing but
seriously like I love all of these
Sunny's and I have such an amazing range
of the Sunny's and website as well so I
definitely recommend getting your key
Sunny's on there
so I wanted to say thank you so much for
watching I will leave all of wet boxes
we take description in the description
bar oh yeah I will also link the links
to everything that I wore in the downbar
so you can find it directly and the
website and all that kind of good stuff
