welcome to the first episode of chit
chat Tuesday so for the next few weeks
expect to see videos on Tuesdays about
anything from mental health to bullying
to friendships to break up everything
between we're going to dissect it we're
going to talk about it and we're going
to discuss it so grab a snack get comfy
get some water if you have you to bread
you can just close this and listen to it
the background like a podcast totally up
to you both thing that we're going to
talk about today into the social media
comparisons and essentially adjust the
millennial generation in general I feel
like these are the things I never see
really talked about on social media and
if you are following my Instagram then
you'll see that I do talk about this if
you do for my blog and you talk about
this I try to be a brought real and open
as I possibly can online because all I
think about young girls who are like 12
13 14 years old and they're so
impressive or they're like sponges just
any information any image anything they
just consume it and believe it I just
really want to put a message out that
sometimes to just say that a lot of the
things that you see are not real a lot
of what I talked about today it will
refer to a YouTube video I saw on a show
called inside quest I'll link it below
and give a lot of what I say today is in
that video but I want to talk about it
as a young person as it is older people
talking about it so when you look at
your phone scientifically it releases
dopamine into your brain and dopamine is
a very very highly addictive happy
feeling when you hear a text when you
get your Instagram notifications jumping
up soon or someone likes your posts or
comments or both you get a sense of like
validation that people like you and
you're accepted and it's just like a
really really addictive feeling and
that's why when people feeling really
down and actually when they do post a
little Instagram photos always do post a
lot more online because they want that
instant gratification of I'm matter I'm
worthy and people like me and it is like
vicious cycle where we get very consumed
by acceptance from others and now my
generation which I believe I suppose I'm
a millennial I was born in 1994 so if I
am in the
so how do I do so or if I am the
generation 4 but regardless we were
brought up in such a different way by
our parents and the generations before
us because we are the generation that
were always told like you're so special
follow your dream I just get to the
phase of getting awards for
participating nowadays even if you come
last and a race or something you still
get an award to make it safe for the
other children but it's not teaching the
right values and life just because you
don't to hurt anyone's feelings in the
long run it's hurting them when they go
into the real world and they don't know
how to function as human beings you and
I crave human connection because that is
the sole purpose of our being it's what
we need to survive
it's just what makes us feel good as
well and in the long run obviously we
need human connection because our bodies
and sinked of Lee want to reproduce to
carry on humanity little light comes on
so it all makes sense at the end of the
day however when you think of our
generation which grew up on social media
so I started on MSN and then I went to
MySpace and then I went to tumblr then
YouTube Twitter Pinterest everything
Facebook how can I forget the most
obvious one Facebook and Instagram
growing up on social media
it kind of brainwashes you in a way to
sort of become an antisocial person I
can admit I do this as well and I'm
showing you to a million times when you
do it when you go out to a restaurant
and you look around the table and
literally everyone is sitting at a table
with their friends with their family on
their phones and they casually look up a
bit yet and they care on their phones
because they are subconsciously telling
you that there is something more
important that I'm looking at the new I
highly doubt that you've got with your
friends and they say to you put your
phone away because we've just accepted
that oh it's okay they're doing
something more important than me and we
just accept that and these days people
will always look for like the better
option so you almost expect people to
cancel on you if someone does cancel on
you you automatically think it's okay
something better came up than me
something more worthy than meat that's
fine and you just accept it my parents
and my grandparents they just cannot
understand the way that we do that how
we almost expect plans to fall through
we always wait for the better option and
we want
like instant gratification and instant
satisfaction that we're doing the best
thing we can possibly be doing right now
and as a generation we've become
extremely antisocial because we don't
know how to form deep human connection
anymore
we are so used to talking to people
online and making friends online when it
comes to making friends in real life we
sort of don't know what to do like we
haven't read the instruction manual yet
on how to talk to people in real life
sometimes social anxiety is becoming
such a common thing these days because
people don't know how to interact and
connect with other human beings in real
life if we have so much control over
what we portray of ourselves on social
media you know you can edit your photos
you can filter your photos you can
choose what to upload you can like put
up a really old photo and pretend it's
like a really recent thing social media
essentially it is the edited existence
of our being so it isn't us it is what
we choose to show the world so when we
meet people in real life we think okay I
can't add anything that I say right now
I can't edit my face I can't filter my
face this is me who I am you start
something every words you don't know
what to say and there's no backspace
button there's no delete button it's
just that's what it is and because we
don't know how to deal with it feels
like a way bigger problem than it would
be for like our parents or anything like
that because we don't know how to handle
it they say that body language speaks
like 70% of your communication and when
you have your phone and it's either here
in your hands you looking up with
someone or it's on the table face down
or face up and you're speaking to them
whether it's a meeting it's a dinner
it's just hanging out a friend's house
if you're like an alien looking down on
a so like why are you so attached to
this piece of technology like we need it
everywhere that we go and I'm so guilty
of this but I have to keep checking my
phone and I kept doing because I'm so on
top of like I don't want to see like hey
comments negativity abusive comments
towards me publicly on my photos I'm
constantly checking and checking and
checking checking my phone try and
delete comments and block people and
it's just crazy because I am a business
my job is me and Who I am and just
betraying out to the world my messages
and stuff like that that I am consumed
by social media so when I am always fine
to me that is business time and I
actually spend a lot of
time away from the phone some people I'm
sure don't even know the off button is
on a phone because we hardly about to
use it I find it so free when I'm on a
really long flight for like twenty one
twenty eight hours I don't get to use my
phone the whole time
it is this overwhelming sense of peace
and calm and it's just so nice to just
be disconnected for a little bit
everything that I say I am guilty of so
I'm not saying that I don't do these
things I'm just relaying to you just to
open your eyes a little bit I think
about it in a third-person perspective
like what we do but think about the
research music festival at Coachella
I think majority people that went to
Coachella honestly probably cared more
about the image they were trying to the
world then being there and experiencing
the atmosphere and watching the band and
stuff like that that's pretty fun
because that is just people's jobs like
to show the fashion in order to show
loves or musical styles like it's finite
that's what they have to do but think
about it you know spending so much money
just to go somewhere to look a certain
way so that you can have gratification
and validation from strangers which is
my life it's just strange
this leads on to the point of comparison
and how toxic it can be I'm not saying
social media is like a terrible awful
thing because how can I sell it's my job
but I absolutely love what I do and love
being able to talk to you about this all
I want to talk about is just some of the
struggles that people go through if they
hate some of my I experienced it too so
I think it's very important that we talk
about comparison and how toxic social
media can be for our own self worth as
well now how many times have you found
yourself scrolling through Instagram
finding an account maybe I make school
page there's someone you're following go
through the intern seed and just
thinking how do they have such a perfect
life perfect relationship a perfect body
they've got so much money they've got
all these things they seem so incredibly
happy and you look through all that
images and you think why can't I have
that you start thinking things like well
you know maybe if I lose some weight
maybe if I go to the gym maybe if I do
this do that maybe I can be like then
maybe I can
like that it's so sad that's what we've
come to we can't accept us for who we
are and we have such low self-esteem as
a whole generation we have grown up
surrounded by imagery of perfect people
a whole entire lives because we grew up
when TV was invented and magazines were
around so we currently saw or like the
Photoshop models in the magazines and
all the pretty actresses on TV and stuff
and I'm talking before the time that
people actually accepted a new about
Photoshop in editing and just thought oh
my god that goers suddenly look
beautiful like how is that possible
so that was toxic enough but then go
into social media it's hard if icky if
you look at them like they're real
people if they're not actresses they're
not models like this is a real person
with a really perfect life you know I
don't understand why does this happen to
me
racing it started with the light and at
times I do that to myself a lot I think
this is the most toxic thing that I do
myself I go on other youtubers pennies
and I see like how well they're doing I
just think oh my god I'm so happy there
but you know why are my videos doing as
well as theirs and people not like me if
you're not getting as many likes on
Instagram or to get people unfollowing
you you instantly feel like a worthless
person it's like the worst feeling ever
because you're like what am I doing
wrong why don't like me more and I read
through that a few weeks ago when I know
it's my visas going down bit and then I
really spiraled into the place of like I
was a certain no one likes me to
something wrong with me and like I was
blaming it all myself instead of
thinking like hey like my audience of
grown-ups probably don't want to see me
do like a pink or gold eyeshadow like
every week so this is why I'm thinking
now well I'm 22 your woman and I want to
sit down and talk about things that I
want to talk about that's one of my
channels going to become half of this
and half of like makeup lifestyle
trouble because this is really important
to me and I feel like discussing this in
the comments just talking about it it's
just so incredibly important I am very
open and honest that the image that I
put out into the world on my social
media like me sitting here right now the
full page makeup on and everything it is
me presenting an image to the world of
what I want to be that's because I am
consumed by social media as well and
that's what I believe is going to
provide acceptance for me to see
validate as
I am like it's crazy we're all such
insecure people with such a low
self-esteem that we just grab onto
anything that we think will give us
acceptance it's so easy to compare
yourself to people and you already have
such low self esteem anyway so you start
looking and looking and looking and
looking and after like an hour of
comparing is that of people you stop and
you feel absolutely worthless let me
tell you as someone whose job is to be
on social media place on Instagram and
post YouTube videos the amount of times
that I snapchat at a party or just set
my house just being like Oh high spirits
like I'm having the best time this party
so much fun oh my god putting the phone
down looking around the room and
thinking if I left actually no one would
notice I'm literally just snap showing
to the world that I'm having the best
time ever because I feel like I have to
show people that you know I'm cool and I
have friends and I do think the amount
of people you see at parties at night
clubs just
snapchatting themselves the whole time
they don't actually spend like two
minutes sitting down having a drink
chatting it's just taken fun of me doing
this take a photo of me doing that and
it's just this constant like I want to
show people that I'm cool that I'm
popular that I have friends and that's
why I stopped doing that so I don't
actually show my friends on social media
anymore unless they're in the industry
than I do but I try not to show them on
snapchat on Instagram tag them on
Facebook or anything because
unfortunately in my situation I have
trolls and people that don't like me so
they will jump over to my friend's
Instagram account and spread hate to
them I didn't think that was okay so
I've stopped showing them so even though
I see my friends all the time
on social media it looks like I don't
have any friends because I'm not showing
anything so to any average person they
will look at my page and be like danny
has new friends
danny is a loser but that's because I'm
only showing you a certain part of my
life so it's so interesting how me
choosing watch a show can make you think
that they know me completely fine image
and it's very very strange that's the
way it works if I go on snapchat I
usually use like the dog filter or like
some skin filter airbrushing filter or
whatever and I always make sure that I
pose and right angles
some days I dress up I take a photo and
then I get back my pajamas you know just
for Instagram and there are times where
I've had weeks where depression just hit
me so hard and I want Instagram saying
my life is amazing and I'm so depressed
and no no I don't want to talk about it
and I just want to show everyone that
I'm so happy and my life is just
incredible and it is just wrong you know
it's my job in a sense so I have to
constantly be relevant and constantly be
posting and every single day I'm working
and Emily works I'm always having to be
on my phone to check things check trends
check what you want to see it can get
extremely really overwhelming so that's
why there's times where I might account
in for my phone away and just sit down
read a book draw write watch TV like
just give something away from the phone
away from the computer we are the people
that are comparing our behind the scenes
tell people to highlight real people
aren't going to close them
brushing up the show with a mascara
running down their face and eating bag
of chips to bed and feeling really gross
because I don't want to they don't want
to portray that to the world they'll get
up really early next day go for a run
with like perfect makeup and clean
eating and show that it's just I'm not
sharing or anything like please don't
think that I'm doing any of that
ridiculousness just talking I hate how
to do story the same is my whole
everything that I say I have to think
about twice and like once I fence on
what a scientist I'm talking about
someone else what if what if whatever
wanted I can say like I've had to change
my personality for social media because
there are things that I do I say with no
intention of harm at all that comes
across as being like horrible or you're
shameless person you're saying that
person like it's just how consuming is
so like ah we don't get much connection
at all in real life anymore so where do
we turn to return to online and
everything is so instant that when we
want to watch like a whole TV series we
turn on that folks we've been to the
whole thing like we don't have to wait
anymore for things if you want to buy
something go online and buy it you know
you'd have to walk down the shops and
buy it you can just sit there and do
everything at the touch your fingertips
it also revolves around to dating in
this day and age I have chosen to be
single selection
laughing ah maybe I had the opportunity
to get into the relationships but it was
just so weird to me when I got into my
previous relationship it was just
unlike the start of social media like
normally had Instagram me anything that
was in 2012 so it's like when that was
just starting about five years ago I
realized back there was a lot
different to relationship now and I
think it's a lot of pressure for couples
like I'm sure if you're in a life it now
and you are quite active on social media
you might have to always post about your
relationship to stop people asking like
have you broken up do you have problems
and being like so involved in your life
guys I really have to impress girls
anymore they just slide right on to know
and then instantly they have a you know
there's no change there's no build up or
anything and then yeah it's girls thing
right oh why don't guys take all that
and takes anymore pick them up we'll do
this or do that but where is much of the
problems they are like we're making it
easy for them to I'm sure one day I'll
be relationship with the right person
and it will all be completely fine but
when you think about the dating world
it's just ridiculous we play games with
each other all the time like who's gonna
like not reply the longest Peter three
hours takes back Simon check three days
but it all kind of leads back to us the
whole like instant gratification social
media world like we are incredibly
impatient as people like we want replies
now we want things done now we want to
buy that now like everything has to be
right now or never so when people take a
little bit longer to reply I'm very
guilty of this I'm a really slow reply
because I actually hate looking at with
me so I might take like five hours reply
but not because I'm playing a mind game
because I'm just busy but someone else
they could think so many things like
that like Danny doesn't like me Danny
thinks I'm annoying don't think so
saying thinks that way literally I'm
just like I just don't look at my phone
right now like it's what nothing to do
personally the same thing like I I went
through a phase where I am followed
heaps of people from social media not
because I dislike them not because I'm
planning with them but because I was
sick of comparing myself to them and
feeling bad
like making myself feel bad so they did
absolutely nothing wrong with us fine
being themselves but I spent too much
time getting myself down because I was
looking at in my boom who pulled me I
don't look like that I don't have that
life I'm
I recommended her I'm slow this
competitor and whatever but I was like I
choose not to see it and I'm followed
and stop looking at it that's leading
people think that I'm fighting with
certain youtubers or fighting with
certain people in general and it's like
I literally don't know what you're
talking about I really wish that one day
this watch is completely 100% open and
honest about everything that I post and
everything that I do I love that love
the fitness world have become a lot more
raw and real and honest I'm actually
show photos and like super bloated it's
just like this is so nice to see like
I'm like that too like I relate to that
it's so nice to feel normal again I've
always had issues of bloating I bloat
underneath my belly button always like
I've never had like a flat stomach and I
sort of fitness Instagrammer recently
closed about her which is exactly the
same I was like oh my god
I'm not weird it's not just me that's
why a few months ago I made a post about
my hip tip I always thought my hips
crazy and like I was the only person in
the world that ever had this but they go
out and then that were my undies sit
there go in and then they go out again
my whole life I'm like there's something
wrong with me at one point I was even
considering doing something like
liposuction of Fixman I was literally so
insecure about and of like wives only me
in the world that has this and one day I
thought you know what screw it I'm just
going to show the world hey these are my
hip dips
they're pretty weird but here's what
they are and the amount of people that
responded to it being like oh my god I
have that as well and I thought I was
like the only person in the world I'm so
happy that someone else has it and it
was just so nice for us to connect to be
like yes another issue too and yes this
is reality and I also have another big
social media person inbox me and so
Danny thank you so much because I always
edit mine out I thought they were wrong
and asking that you posted that I'm not
going to edit them anymore and that was
just so lovely and I think the game
where you had both your phones like
space down on the table and now I can
look at it and if anyone looks at their
phone and picks it up has to pay the
entire bill is a great game the message
I want to send across is that everything
you see on social media is what people
choose to show you it is not completely
100% them normal SC every waking moment
of someone's life so we don't know if
they are incredibly severely depressed
we don't know if they fight with our
control
working 24/7 but occasionally get a nice
photo if you could tell me in the
comments the next topics and discussions
you would like to talk about Frey notes
chitchat Tuesday that would be great
I'll definitely be looking down below at
all your suggestions and I'm so excited
to start a new series of you I honestly
just can't sit down have a cup of tea
with you and just chat next time I will
not do it at sunset because it's gotten
so dark right now and I'm just like no
go wrap it up gotta go
so thank you guys so much for watching
I'll see you on Friday and have an
amazing week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
