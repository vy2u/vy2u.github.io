today I have a winter makeup tutorial to
share with you all it is going to in
Australia by the way in case you were
wondering why I'm doing this random
video right now this has a lot of deep
reds deep pink tones and all that kind
of stuff and this is a look that I have
been loving so I thought I would
recreate it for you guys
some please also let me know what you
think of my new setup yeah let's get
straight into the tutorial so how many
of you guys are excited as well because
it's so annoying
I think my prescription is negative 3.75
or something along those lines and I
have a stigmatism
in my left eyes I was born with pretty
bad eyes I'd love to know for anyone
else because my pain and goes through
that as well because I wouldn't feel so
alone and so rapidshare with her all the
time and I'm just buffing this into my
skin with the Real Techniques buffing
brush your foundation is now on my skin
is looking a lot better first thing that
we're gonna do today is eyes before we
do any concealing and bronzing and
contouring and anything ending in ink
and we are going to start with the Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot we're going to rub
this on our eyes and then powder over
the top and then we will start with the
eye shadows
both taking the Paint Pot which has
never been it used before look at that
oh my god I'm just scrubbing a little
bit of my fingers and I'm going to rub
it all over my eyelids I'm just taking
my Australis fresh and flawless powder
and I'm going to dust it on top of the
pink but just so that it won't
now using the colour-pop eyeshadow in
shark attack and I'm going to use this
with a blender brush I'm gonna put this
on my upper crease here just for a
transition shade and then I'm gonna have
a darker Brown underneath it and then
I'm just going to start swirling my
brushes well just you make sort that
make sure that all the excess of the
product is being used and it's blending
up so now to darken it up we are using
the color of rumor has it intoxicated a
super shock shadow it by color pop and
it's this gorgeous dark matte brown
shade and I'm going to place this on my
crease and then I'm going to blend it in
with the red that we have sitting above
it
now I'm taking a shock attack once again
and I'm going to place this with a
concealer brush on the lid
now I have this beautiful shade of
called drift and I'm going to use this
shade with a real techniques domed
shadow brush as well and I'm going to
pop it here on the outer corner of my
eye I'm also going to place a little bit
on my inner corner like a little
sandwich method
I believe it's referred to so I'm just
popping a little bit more on my corner
inner corner I mean
now I'm taking this gorgeous shade
called tassel it is a white shimmery
shade and I'm gonna place this in the
middle of my lid I'm gonna use a petite
crease brush I'm using the completely
wrong brush for this but it works for me
yes I'm just gonna get that white shade
and I'm going to pack it onto the middle
of my lid
first off I'm just going to take a big
fluffy brush and blend that all in
together
an alpha extremely hot hot I'm going to
have to attempt to do eyeliner in the
middle and then just do it very very
very gently along I'm using like this
side of my pan not the tip just so that
it's very thin so now there is quite a
thin line on the top of the lid what I'm
going to do is sort of point here in the
middle of my eyebrow and the corner of
my eye and I'm going to drag it over
into the middle
once there is a vague outline I'm just
going to go ahead and fill in all the
gaps
I'm just gonna apply a coat of mascara
before I put on any false lashes just to
I don't even know why I do it but I just
do so I'm just popping on a bit of
mascara I'm using the Too Faced better
than sex mascara and it's the lashes
today I'm using these Cara eyelashes
these are the ones that I get for one
dollar from a shop miss a they are my
Holy Grail eyelashes I love them so so
so so so much so I'm going to go ahead
and pop these on my eyes what I loved
about these eyelashes is that they are
very very long and very thick but
they're still very very very natural
looking at the same time if they've put
on the right way
now focusing on the face again so what
I'm going to do first is grab my naked
skin concealer in the shade light warm
so I'm just going to start by placing a
bit of this concealer under my eyes and
this concealer is keep the lighter than
my skin but I'm using it because I love
the highlight effect and I think we've
in our shadow it works really well for
that I'm actually get a small mirror
because that's taking up half the frame
so I'm just gonna go ahead and use a
damp Beauty Blender and then blend this
in
and now to sculpt the face I'm using Sun
bunny by Too Faced and I'm using this
with a models prefer contour brush down
my cheekbones got quite heavy on the
contour today just because this winter
look it's allowed to be dramatic now I'm
just gonna go ahead and finish off the
bottom of my eyes using the zoeva luxe
pencil brush and the color pop super
shock shadow and achieved and now using
the same brush I'm going to take tassel
once again on the same brush which I
just did
and I'm gonna place this as an inner
corner highlight
and what was aimed in I may as well put
a little bit of mascara on the bottom
lashes because they are a bit naked at
the moment and then finally going in
with the Eye of Horus got a smokey eye
pencil in black I'm just going to drag
this halfway on my lower waterline now
I'm going to take my NYX baked blush in
for play and also my Mac soft and gentle
and I'm actually going to dip my brush
into both of these and use them together
so like I sort of blushed with a
sparkling highlight just going to swirl
my brush in it the blush and then in the
highlight as well mixing them together
and then I'm just going to go ahead and
pop this onto my cheeks
after the final step of the look
bringing it all together I'm going to
start using the spice lip liner by Mac
and use this to my my lips
and then I'm taking what I revolve this
whole Quran which is my MAC lipstick in
daiva this is my new obsession I love
this lipstick so much and this whole
look revolves around eight of us so
we're gonna pop it on and then they look
over be complete
so thank you guys so much for watching
this tutorial today I'm so sorry if it
was out of focus at all but I'm pretty
much blind right now without my contact
lenses so it's been a little bit of a
struggle for me I hope you guys have a
brilliant week any comments and feedback
are always appreciated and I'll see you
really soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
