today we have AQ and a of a bunch of
questions that I've never ever answered
before on my channel that you guys sent
me through Twitter to make sure that you
are following my to put it because
that's what I asked for all the
questions for the future Q&amp;amp;A you're
gonna join us for this it's everyone
else out there who has a dog does your
dog kind of like try to kno G when
they're hungry but it is not for another
hour which she's just being like so
we're gonna go ahead and get stuck
straight into these questions so without
further ado a little bit to it alright
the first question asks do you sometimes
wish you still little your family in
Australia I miss my family every single
day there's not been a single time where
I've been like I don't miss them anymore
anything like that I obviously missed
them all the time making this really
sentimental I don't think right now I
would be moving back to Australia I wish
there was some way of like a
teleportation device I could kind of
like go there and go to England really
quick but they are coming to visit me
very soon so I like super super super
excited about that oh this is from
sherry hello sherry so she says what is
your favorite part of the day when it's
spent with your boyfriend what is your
favorite activity to do together my
favorite time of the day is when he
comes home from work and I'm there
waiting for him with little bean and we
just like to breathe I love that moment
when he walks in the door we just always
kind of have like a big big hug a big
reuniting hug but yeah I love it love it
love it love it when he comes home when
we have a big big big squeeze and I say
our favorite activity to do together
this adorable right is walking we love
going on walks she loves coming with us
she's loving the fact that she's getting
all these really long walks these days
with us we just love parks and lakes
we're just like a really old soul couple
I suppose what do you think your life is
going to be like when your YouTube
career ends kids marriage any other
career choice it's also I love you so
I love you too that is a massive
question I think there's so many options
out there like it's not like if I'm not
gonna cheer but I can't do anything I'm
just I'm just get a job or go back and
study I've been so lucky to have had
such an amazing youtube adventure so far
so I take every single day blessing but
I obviously know it's not gonna last
forever and I really spend too much time
thinking about it but I would like to
kind of have something off of YouTube as
well like I know I have my last brand
but something kind of non really related
I'm trying to figure out what it is I
feel like it will come to me at the
right time but I feel like there's
another project inside of it which is
more kind of lifestyle home based which
I would love to explore the times right
but I think I would probably get back
it's like something arty like graphic
design like I studied I always wanted to
do like product packaging design
probably something really cool like that
so I honestly have no idea but the
opportunities are endless so the other
part of the question said kids merge so
this is the thing that I kind of feel
them myself I've noticed for like mummy
vloggers or family vloggers they get so
much negativity in hate and it's
horrible to see like it's just
relentless and just awful there's some
things I've read in some woman's comment
sections when they're pregnant or when
they have young kids and stuff I think
oh my lord I would not want to do with
that pressure I feel like when it comes
to me settling down and having children
my art I don't think I'd want to kind of
vlog or anything maybe put up a blog of
like a birthday party of the kids
whatever but not daily vlogging my life
with my children because for me I just
think that you open yourself up so just
way too much criticism away too much
abuse because everyone has different
parenting styles and it's just something
that I don't think I see happening I
don't really see myself like daily
vlogging when I have children but I see
myself you know doing something
different married obviously one day
fantastic at the minute you know I'm 23
turning 24 I feel like if I were to get
engaged I wouldn't want to get married
for a long time that makes sense I would
be that kind of person he's like
engaged for a while I mean because I
think marriage to me marriage is a
commitment for life it's not just
something to kind of just do it the next
step it's something which means forever
so you'd want to make sure that you and
the other person a compatible the rest
of your life so I feel like being
engaged for like a longer period of time
and living together in that period is
the most successful thing for a healthy
marriage in my case I don't know what
I'm like living at people I've always
lived Alliance I don't know if I'd end
up like ripping each other's heads off
but for now I'm just cruising along and
enjoying it but yeah I think marriage is
a big deal so it's something that people
really need to put a lot of thought in
for sure what kind of image do you want
to present to all the people looking up
to you through social media what do I
want to portray the thing is when I
started my channel I really looked at it
as like I was a big sister to a lot of
girls that were kind of going through
that an issue I was the kind of person
that I wish I had when I was going
through issues and I feel like it's
changed slightly it's now that I'm a
woman I'm older I'm obviously not a
teenager anymore I'm closer to my
mid-twenties that I had my teens were
just everything but I think that what I
want to portray out there it's just a
sense of like you and I are the same
like we're both equal there's no
hierarchy between us with both people we
chat about certain things chat about
certain topics and I want to come across
as real as possible and that's why I
like really thinking about my content
recently I've you know change certain
things like no more cameras with
airbrush filters no more cameras that
make me look skinny I felt like I was
being put in a box for so long because I
was categorized as a community goon and
not so much like a lifestyle mental
health Channel or vlog channel that I
kind of felt like I had to act a certain
way and be certain character and I've
touched on this a few times I've read I
recently went to it in my victim Roth
look too so I was ultimately pretending
to be someone that wasn't Danny and I
was just confused I would spend like
hours like scrutinizing my photos and
putting up photos and poses they're like
I wouldn't do like just work me at all
so I was only recently that
when I was like you know what screw it
no more like I'm just gonna sit in my
bedroom again film really old school
again
no more filtering and I'm what about
like I want to be raw real authentic I
want to portray like a woman who's real
who was your friend and we sit in my
room and we chat together about certain
things whether it be beauty tips or
mental health chats or talking about my
small boobs like you know what I mean
like I just wanted to be like we're
together which heading and when I meet
any of you like it means everything to
me like everything it makes me feel like
I just have so many friends over your
own it's really really lovely did you
ever go through a phase of wanting to
quit YouTube I watched Shane Dawson's
video the day of when he kind of gave
great bad girl a channel reboot and she
said I almost feel like people are
laughing when I cry when she said that
about her channel failure and stuff I
was like that's very accurate that's how
you feel sometimes if things aren't
going a certain way and you can pass up
to others you may truly just think that
people are just so happy about your
failures but then I completely
disconnected from that at one point and
I actually I'm still disconnected from
that because I no longer care what
people say there's been instances
recently where I've been dragged into
certain dramas and you guys see I never
bite back like I never add fuel I just
sit and I think come on like more mature
than this same goes for people that just
like me or write hate about me I don't
have an issue with it anymore because I
think everyone's entitled to their own
opinion and if they don't like something
about me that's completely fine because
it's none of my business
you saw doesn't like me so I've stopped
caring about that and now I'm just
enjoying my youtube channel for making
content that I love and I enjoy so I
don't feel like quitting it all makes
sense because I'm really enjoying it
again but I have definitely periods when
I have not enjoyed it and it's so
transparent you guys can always see
through when a youtuber isn't their true
self or they're kind of putting on an
act or a front so I think a lot of you
know the time so I haven't been 110%
into it
it smells really bad I was just in a bad
place or not being myself I'm good right
now but I definitely have wanted to quit
and the fun fact is actually about two
months into starting my youtube channel
I was on the like delete your account
button I was actually like screw it it's
not worth or like the abuse I'm getting
for people in real life like saying how
cringy is whatever and I was gonna
delete my channel and they're like
somebody came over me it was like don't
do it but I was so close to deleting my
channel yeah two months into it and I
wouldn't be here right now thank God
that I did it last question is how to
deal with people constantly causing you
drama even after you've cut them off all
I have to say about that is rise above
if people are dragging you into drama
trying to get you involved in something
like attacking you or ever rise above
like don't sink to that level and just
grow through what you go through
essentially and rise above that's all I
have to say for it I don't believe in
like fighting fire with fire even if you
have to defend yourself you can defend
yourself without name-calling you can
defend yourself without being nasty the
thing is like drama or something which
is always gonna be about it's always
gonna be a part of what I do I'm always
gonna be criticized I'm always gonna
have people making opinions making
assumptions body shaming me shaming me
on the way I look showing me on the way
that I speak thinking that I speak with
the fake accent now and all this kind of
stuff which is so not true I am English
a local don't realize this I can't even
getting into this right how many so he
didn't like basically I know in my
comments a lot of people are saying that
I'm putting on an English accent I'm not
putting on anything like this is just
the way I am I'm a chameleon with
accents if I went to Australia for a
week I'd get a really strong Australian
accent again and the thing is when I
moved to Australia for the first time I
was 12 I had lived in England obviously
from birth to 12 but I had an English
accent moved to Australia and I got an
Australian accent in two weeks and I've
mentioned that a lot on my channel I'm
just wanted people that can tap into
accents really really quick so right now
I've got this kind of like Australian
English accent a lot of people think
it's fake and put on but oh my god that
would be so exhausting if I just sat
here pretending to put on an accent I
might as well do like a fun accent like
a
exactly something because like uh anyway
back to question if you want to avoid
drama and you've already cut them off
rise above ignore be the bigger person
and all I can say is karma is there for
a reason you don't have to do the dirty
work because it will be sorted out with
karma in the end so take a seat back and
just be like okay this is happening
right now
and then let it go I think massive thank
you to guys for watching this QA today
thank you to everyone the same three
questions I'm sure I'll do another Q&amp;amp;A
very soon but until next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
