like oh my goodness I can't actually
remember a lot of times I do Q&amp;amp;A so I
asked you guys to ask me on Twitter to
answer some questions obviously doesn't
really need an intro so let's get right
into the question first question comes
from selfie addict a smaller one once
you find your dream guy do you plan on
having kids and if so how many yes I
want kids I want to have two kids
ideally I'd love to have a boy and a
girl but I am open to having more kids
than that but not for a while
definitely not for a while what is your
favorite personality trait in another
person kindness I'd say I think just
good manners as well I know it's hard
like if I am at a restaurant or
something with a friend or a guy or
whatever and they are really rude to the
waiter or just have bad manners that's
an instant turnoff for me good manners
kindness is like a huge thing that I
really love and appreciate and other
people for H others are Oh God not
naming names but have you ever blocked
any other youtubers on social media if
so why um have I blocked any other
youtubers I feel like I have blocked one
youtuber on Twitter and one on Instagram
to different people for different
reasons the one on Twitter was painted
to go actually but this person was just
constantly negative and constantly in my
mentions just like having their two
cents about everything that I said and
it wasn't constructive at all it was
just annoying and super negative being
easily et's like you don't have to be
best friends with every single person in
the community there is a huge
expectation I suppose from the user
community and viewers to expect that
every single person in the industry and
with best friends I can assure you that
behind the scenes there are a lot of
broken friendships in this industry and
drama and ridiculous
I don't value anyone more if they are a
youtuber because this person that I have
sloth-like
they made me feel constantly bad like
annoyed and frustrated because they were
just so negative all the time so whether
or not their youtuber or a normal person
I would have liked so either way because
it's just like meh whatever and then on
Instagram I think there's one and same
reason like you don't have to get up
with everyone if someone has done
anything to really hurt you
you can walk them you're allowed to walk
them it's completely fine so yes I have
I know I'm not getting into detail but
here they are
don't try and find out who they are
because it's just it's to fail if
there's some people in this industry
that kind of annoy me and then I block
them and that's it in the story which
really it's just the same as any other
workplace what is the best thing that's
happened to you he's moved to England
good question what is the best thing
that's happened to me I probably say the
best thing that's happened is my
friendship with Talia because my entire
life I just wanted to find someone like
her now that I have her I am so grateful
so it's lovely that I can wish you just
like call her and we can catch up you
know you're like because we only live
about an hour away from each other and
whenever I get a car one day it will
make my life so easy that I can actually
go up and see her more because getting
the train to know that I at least three
hours for some reason from Brighton
sorry and I well okay okay I'm going to
car soon so I can like you know do a bit
easier but I say definitely Talia
probably one of the best things I feel
so protective of her I'm so proud of her
as well like actually the sister to me
anyone ever says a bad word about her
I'm literally like no I'm sure look at
personnel like you mentioned her you
mess with me like I look white ever hear
anyone say anything nasty about Angela I
adore her and she makes if you're really
really really good when I'm with her and
that's the most important thing
it's just surround yourself with people
that make you feel better not people
that make you feel negative and crap so
obviously I have all the time in the
world
and definitely I like just having like a
few close friends or having her in my
life is awesome and I just feel like
she's means it in a different body and
we always say things at the same time
and Japanese just like this Brighton
feel like home yet and do you get
homesick at all well to be honest I'm
actually quite surprised by how easily I
settled in here like I figured I come
here and this whole month I'd be really
sad and down lonely and stuff but it's
been the complete opposite I feel so
much more at home and content than they
did in vuelven and I've only been in
Netflix three weeks so something like
three weeks tomorrow which blows my mind
I feel like I've eaten so much other
than that but I literally felt like I
was at home here with in like four days
the third day I was me it was like I
kind of roll across a day which was dead
it means rising you guys so we break
down on camera huh that was great but
that was like my only really emotional
day and home sick day I mean there's
times obviously where like I wish my
family could be here and I wish I could
just see them and do things that I mean
adding FaceTime and stuff now I can do
it makes everything so much easier
leave my mom's coming out here like two
weeks anyway so in a way that's made me
a lot less homesick knowing that I'm
going to see you really soon so probably
fine well yeah I don't know it's been
surprisingly fine like set it in pretty
well and I'm really happy here it was a
good question here's your favorite
couple on love island okay if you
haven't really you know I'm obsessed
with live island it's like a reality
show on everything night in year and I
really wanted to watch it last year but
I couldn't find it like anywhere in
Australia so now that it's on here and I
can actually watch it live I like to eat
it everything and I'm like it's good my
favorite couple on love island has to be
Johnny and Camilla because they are just
oh they might be so happy probably by
the time is upload I'm convinced in some
days it's going from Tuesday so
hopefully they're still together five
but I love Johnny and Camila I think
they are just the best and Johnny is a
Jen and Camila is a lady and it just I
love it
do you ever wish you didn't live alone
not including beans and if so who would
you want to live with okay I have a
love/hate relationship with living alone
I love it I love having my own space
because I am quite introverted person so
I kind of thrive off these by myself and
I can get quite drained by being around
people all the time but yes there are
many times where I wish I lived with
someone because it can get very quiet I
can get very lonely and it's more I
don't know it's not just having someone
to talk to that's the biggest thing
because I sit at home all day by myself
working all day and I think obviously
like I would not like not eventually so
I just think about things and then
actually can you know start to overthink
stuff but I've kind of train my brain to
not do that is much these days
sometimes yeah I guess it's more just
like the human contact is to talk to
someone so yeah alright but I do love
living ions but I don't I wish I could
come live like heart I was the one of
those things then did people ever talk
about your channel in a bad way when you
first started as I have one and I wonder
how to brush up tinnitus yes it is
because when I started YouTube was like
where you watch cat videos it wasn't
like sit in your room and talk to camera
and upload it and everyone thought it
was really weird so I started like three
years ago now the children - I don't
know if it's years ago I have no idea
the government 7:15 I think yes it's two
years ago well Matt's a brave lad man
yes I started when like no one really
knew was going on and I knew there was
like three youtubers video that I
watched besides that there are also many
much of the community out all that you
guys know of today and Nan really
understood it and I feel like if you
start a channel now it's a lot more like
an understood thing for it back then
everyone was like you're weird
look I know but whatever it gets me a
lot I contemplated deleting my channel
with like those two months I don't know
something because I felt like it was
going nowhere and I
going to use of hate from people it's
natural it's going to happen that people
are going to be confused with the thing
is people actually really curious and
that's why they do it everything they're
not actually thinking at all that
they're lame it's kind of like what is
she doing kind of thing but for me every
single person that was kind of negative
towards me about my channel now love
YouTube we want people that are very
invested in like picking your party come
like to social media Instagram fashion
people like it does it like literally
talking so generally I'm not anyone
specifically trust me just talking
generally I have found yet but a lot of
people it any crap do it now but in
terms of dealing with the hey as you are
honestly I can tell you so many things
but it's something that will come in
time because for the first year of
YouTube I was all upset all the time for
more like negative comment and I
wouldn't even like tech notices an
iPhone because all I would ever think
about was the negative ones and
literally it beat me down so bad because
I let it do that so the most important
thing I ever told myself was I will
never take the comments personally
unless I know them personally and as
soon as I tell myself that it literally
doesn't matter to me more I really hate
comments towards gravity but you haven't
met me you see like what I choose to
edit a video of on a screen and half the
time I'm kind of different on camera
than Adam for life as well and we like
them a lot more quiet a lot more shy and
a lot more boring on camera I try to be
that kind of people like they don't know
me so it doesn't affect me but it's my
mum turn around to me into some like the
master comments that I get then that
would affect me if that makes any sense
so just remember that but if people you
do know in real life still I'm giving
you hate and stuff who cares
literally who cares if you want to do it
if it makes you happy do it screw them
like seriously block them up everything
you possibly can and remove
from your life because you don't need
that trust me
what was love coming to someone Monday
the last time I kissed someone
yeah you ever think about it we need to
know about um new how do you feel about
being single and are you looking for
relationship I know where you guys are
asking I know I know what you're asking
ah I'm single um to be honest I don't
believe in looking for relationships I
believe they find you if it feels right
go for it that's the kind of like what
do I have and I'm someone that doesn't
like to plan ahead as well which is you
know it's just kind of hopped on a plane
to move to and I was like oh whoops now
all I could obviously have much of a
plan a very impulsive person so I want
to sleep a little bit like I don't want
it to end book for relationship if find
someone and it feels right before they
support you and you support them and
it's like a very mutual thing then how's
your mental health improved since
leaving England yes so much literally so
i monitors probably the best thing I
could have ever done for my mental
health when I think about it I'm not
gonna body guys I was so unhappy so
unhappy in Melbourne and I had been so
unhappy for years and I mean like even
since before I thought YouTube like it's
really hard to explain and people get
very offended because they believe that
I'm saying England's better than
Australia I'm not saying that at all
what i'm saying is that because I grew
up here it's where I belong and where I
feel at home I'm not saying that one
country is better than the other in any
way shape or form for me personally I
just feel like more comfortable here and
like this is my home so I belong and
unfortunately I never felt like I
belonged in Australia for the ten years
that I lived there I know the accident
into seeing this but like seriously it's
family weren't there still I wouldn't
really have much of a reason to go back
and visit them act innocence
unfortunately love negative associations
with Melbourne because of my school life
and bullying and people there that you
know do things to me and stuff that I
don't know like I just don't really like
thinking about it being in a place where
I felt kind of trapped and like I didn't
belong there and very unhappy naturally
it didn't really help my mind so I spend
a lot of days in bed literally in bed
doing nothing all week and just letting
the depression take over or letting
myself be really anxious something that
my psychologist psychiatrist sort of a
therapist told me back when I had
therapy about a year ago now it's really
tricky because I have so many triggers
in Melbourne from things that have my
life that you guys don't know about and
stuff that just being in certain places
around certain people would treat me to
get quite anxious and panicky and now
that I'm here I don't have that
association much less anxious not like
look I mean it this game played deep she
did kind of say in a way not like okay
let's talk about speech esj but I have
really intense triggers which would just
snap me into like the worst kind of
thing and some of my friends have seen
in my mum's doing it a lot when I get
into that thing it's kind of like a
panic attack but it's a lot worse and I
let you shut down as a person and I'm
just literally I don't know it's
something we don't was just talking
about I'm chopping a mental hell I guess
I've had more happy guys here in three
weeks that I've lived here than I have
all year living in Melbourne so that's
like the biggest thing to say but yeah I
feel hit them we have obviously had a
few moments where I've been a bit down
or felt quite low but nowhere near why
brilliant regularly in Melbourne so I'm
not saying it long since the bad side
unfortunately at some of the people in
Melbourne which has made it a bit of it
unfortunate ice for me
Melbourne as a city is beautiful like it
is so stunning it's some wherever I
should go because it's just gorgeous
but I hope you understand that I'm not
saying like England's bet or anything
because I see a lot of people saying
that no that's not what I mean at all
it's just that I feel at home here and I
hope you guys understand that so I'd
love to go up topic sometimes no no
seriously that's all the questions that
I'm going to answer you today thank you
guys start sending through it and thank
you so much for watching all the way to
the end because I'm an amazing like and
I'll see you all very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
