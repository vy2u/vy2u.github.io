today's fear we are doing a Q&amp;amp;A and as
always one of you guys to be as
intrusive as possible to make this lots
of fun beans is also in the backgrounds
if you hear nice naughty noises it's not
me I promise so let's get into it okay
first question comes from the z18 who
asked what is your absolute favorite
memory of you and Thalia now this is
something which I feel like no one's
gonna find funny at all but we found it
so funny we were just pulling into LAX
into the airport and as we were there
was just like American Airlines plane
either landing or taking off I can't
remember the thing is is that the uber
driver at the time was playing a song
which just fit so perfectly it was that
I can't even explain to you guys why we
found it so funny but this plane was
just so dramatic with the song we were
just like in fits of laughter and I
don't know why but the whole rest of the
day we were just like rolling around and
playing laughing about the stupidest
stuff and every single time I see like a
plane land I'm just like damn stop are
you saying in England in the future or
will you move back to Australia just
signed a 12-month lease so I will be
here for 12 months definitely and I have
like absolutely no idea will end up in
the future but for now I'm here and I've
got this one here as well I don't really
want to put her through that whole plane
process again because it was a big thing
for you wasn't it an expensive thing for
me wasn't it I was waiting for this one
have you been on any dates recently
what's your ideal date and ideally when
do you want to get married
big question have I been on any dates
recently yes I have my ideal date
honestly is like the simplest of a
simple
I love thoughtful things for like a
picnic we have something really cute and
then like an expensive meal at a
restaurant and the picnic will cost
honestly like a few dollars a few pounds
it would be much at all I love in cozy
and like simple nice things so we're
still getting dressed up to go out to
dinner as fun and all but sometimes I'm
just like I'm not comfy look at these
heels and this dress and it's just nice
to kind of um doggy is stuck in my
throat it's just nice sometimes to do
something chill and simple I guess and
when do I want to get married I have no
idea when I was like a little girl I
thought it'd be married like in my early
20s but here I
I don't have a clue I would love to be
my life like two or three years and then
have children I think 25 I'd love to be
like engaged or married which is
something two years away so where's here
what is one thing that really puts you
off of a person that is a good question
arrogance cockiness I suppose like if
I'm talking to a guy and he's so shut up
himself and so rude to people because he
feels like he's superior and stuff that
for me is where my biggest turnoff if
you're out at a restaurant and they
routes the waiter or something it's like
hi nice to meet you never singing again
kind of thing you know I honestly have
like a list of spotting and F boy and
then when I pick up the signs for that
I'm just like oh go away from me this is
actually a really really good question I
am gonna answer this really honestly how
many youtubers not strictly PD
have you met in real life that you no
longer talk to so I'm gonna answer this
in a very honest way because you know
why not it's not really that big of a
deal to answer this I think something
which a lot people need to understand
about the YouTube world in each your
community is that other youtubers are
like colleagues more than friends
sometimes it doesn't mean that every
single issue has to be best friends
because it's just like work let's just
say that you are an accountant right and
you work in firm like keep some other
accountants it doesn't mean that you
have to hang out every single day like
they do colleagues and that's how I kind
of feel YouTube is these days I think
obviously when YouTube first started and
many you should have said this there's
way more of a community and I do miss
that so much you know or the collabs and
stuff that used to happen it was like
it's really friendly space but then
naturally you know people progressed
they started growing their own
businesses and becoming quite like the
people that it was harder and harder and
harder to kind of share that with others
so I completely understood and I've not
taken any offense to or anything like
that I think the thing is with youtubers
there's so much so much that isn't
communicated I feel like this one shade
there's so much like passive
aggressiveness and I'm someone who likes
to kind of outright say to someone like
what's going on here or privately
message to them and ask them is
everything okay between us but at the
end of the day I've been to quite a few
events with a few youtubers like in my
own
to overseas or whatever and when you're
at the event it's great because like you
can chat about heaps of things and you
get to know them and it's a really
really lovely experience to be involved
the same place together but I feel that
to be honest it's it there's no right
workers it's just business let's just
say that it's professional business I'm
not going to take it to heart if they
unfollow me or stop talking to me or
doing my photos I used to take it to
heart but now I've learned maybe I'm
just not the other thing anymore and
that's fine because maybe they're not my
thing anymore it doesn't matter it is
unfortunate that obviously in the
industry that we are people will just
dig in dig and dig and think like what
was the issue that causes why aren't
they friends anymore but it's more like
what we friends would start what we're
just like the same people doing the same
job hanging out you know if we
especially if we live in different
places that's why it can be a bit hard
to kind of like stay in contact I
suppose for me recently I went on
Twitter and I went on another influences
Twitter and it now I'm had like the
followers you think on top and I thought
oh that's a bit we're like a burden
offender anyway but I'm not gonna get
mad about it I'm just gonna respect the
fact that maybe you know she's just not
interested in my content anymore and
that's that because for me as well I
unfollowed heaps of YouTube is not
because I dislike furthermore there's
any shade but for the fact that I'm
insecure a lot of the time so as an
example there's a bunch of like Fitness
influences and certain other influences
and because I have my own insecurities
seeing that post all the time would make
me feel down about myself and it has
nothing to do with them because what
they're doing is amazing and they have
fantastic buddies a fantastic lives and
everything like this but the thing is
that I got to a point where it was
actually affecting my mood seeing
certain photos of people and I felt like
inadequate compared to them and I
thought I do really sportsperson I do
really love them but I can't see their
stuff on the feed from my own brain
nothing my brain just can't take it
sometimes because I haven't quite
figured out how to stop comparing myself
to certain people so there's some people
that I love and support so much and will
always support but I can't follow them
for the sake of the fact that I have my
own issues if that makes any sense so a
lot of the time it is not that big a
deal you know for that question I'd say
most youtubers that I meet
no longer talk to me but I don't take
that personally anymore because I've
just learned that it's not just me that
happens to there's so many youtubers out
there that just lose contact and it is
just for the fact of like the community
just isn't what it used to be I suppose
it is a little bit competitive these
days because people finding it really
hard to actually make money that
clickbait is becoming a massive thing
because people aren't making Adsense
money anymore you know for some of us
I've used a bit low for others like it's
a bit hard to gain subscribers e-cig so
there's people watching YouTube so you
can imagine that kind of environment
when it's hard enough as it is that
people do become a little bit more
competitive than they used to so it kind
of makes sense and I just don't take it
to heart anymore and you know coming to
England and meeting all the English
beauty bloggers and stuff they're so
lovely and so friendly so I'm really
excited to like start new friendships
with them and stuff too another great
question coming up physically what part
of your body do you feel most pressure
to change but the influence of social
media trends etc and are there any other
procedures you have /r considering this
is quite a big question yes social media
is maybe want to change so much from my
body and I had to remember am I doing
this for me or am i doing it to fit into
the certain like Instagram girl
aesthetic it's a hard one I made it to
wait about this little while ago and
I've just learnt now that if I go on
holiday I'll just wear like nice dresses
and my summery stuff instead of wearing
bikinis because whatever you're most
confident and you'll be most beautiful
in it end of the day like if I'm more
confident wearing a dress and I've got
like relaxed body language and I look
really happy then you look more
attractive than being in a bikini and
being like covering off and you know it
means so yeah it's fine there's always
ways around it like I'm not going to go
and get a liposuction and a Brazilian
butt lift and fat injected here in there
and cheek fillers and boob jobs and all
this kind of stuff because I wouldn't be
doing it for myself I don't think I'd be
doing it for the approval of others in
my situation that's what it would be
I've always you know considered having
my boobs done because I have quite wide
hips and you know they're not really in
proportion with my hips would be great
if they're like a cup size bigger or so
like that and especially when love
Island was on that really like watching
the girls on that violent I was
like I need a big job after watching
this if you don't love Ireland is
basically it's a reality show your girls
from bikinis like all day on it
they most of my boob jobs I'm pretty
sure and it just literally made me feel
like oh my god I need a boob job the
boob job over time I just was like maybe
I should relax a bit or something in my
mind though because I've always been a
bit like yeah like I don't wave like
low-cut stuffer often if I do like
that's a big thing for me so I don't
know I've always like kind of thought
about that but I'm not too sure and in
my industry so it's not only like online
but at events because if some instances
where influence might talk a lot about
procedures and kind of promoting about
how good liposuction was for them or how
good their Butler for their job in
hearing it you're kind of like oh maybe
I should do another no but I don't know
I just had to learn to like just tell
myself no Danny if you're confident
you'll look beautiful so it doesn't
matter like what you look like it
matters about like the vibe the energy
that you're giving off I mean the whole
like gym you know side of the year me
working out all the time getting big bum
big legs was that for me hmm
doubt it yes that was but the fact of
like it was a trend and everyone had
this big farm and all of a sudden I felt
like so out of its my fun was like a
pancake and then I worked and welcome
back to work and also yeah you know it
was kind of because I was like seeing a
guy who was a bit of a dick and kind of
made a comment about my mom so I was
like working it out time eating the
wrong kind of stuff having an awful kind
of diet in a sense of just like not
having enough calories and it was just
not a good time and you could tell my
videos that I just wasn't happy like yes
I had this body I had abs and I had a
bomb and stuff but I was miserable like
I was so miserable and I've had to learn
that you know by eating whatever I want
in moderation and having a balanced diet
and a balanced lifestyle I am so much
happier then working out all the time
and eating the same thing every single
day at having my earth and my protein
shake then my chicken and broccoli and
it was just like why am I doing this I
will go back into gym when I'm doing it
for myself not what I'm doing it to like
get the approval that doesn't matter I
suppose in the day like I used to spend
so much time worrying about certain
things that I should change about myself
and nowadays I'm just like why but I
think I will conclude my Q&amp;amp;A there I
really hope you guys enjoyed it I had a
lot of fun actually speaking to you
about
two things and lots of issues and I hope
that you guys enjoyed it so until next
time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
