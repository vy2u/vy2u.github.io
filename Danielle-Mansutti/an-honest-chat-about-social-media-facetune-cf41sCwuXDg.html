really long time now and I've attempted
to film it a few times and I just
couldn't I couldn't express it properly
so I'm hoping I can just get this out
there and one take so that there's no
editing involved raised as raw and real
as we can possibly make it
because there's something which should
be on my mind for a long time now and I
feel I can't move on completely to the
next stage of my life until I put this
out there into the open acknowledge it
and then put it behind me there are a
few things that I'd like to talk about
in this video and the main thing I will
start with first so as you guys know I
have been on YouTube since I was about
19 or 20 years old so I've spent you
know four years growing up online so
every single mistake that I've ever made
unlike the average person is accessible
for anyone to watch and anyone that
meets me can just see my past and that
is such an unusual thing like to be able
to to see the old versions of people
instantly so it's a blessing and a curse
in that sense so it's been things that
I've said things that I've done over the
years that have been put onto the
internet that I don't agree with anymore
you know I said things in the past which
character that I am today I've grown
I've learned from mistakes I would never
say things like that just as we all do
we are all human being so we all learn
and we grow through our mistakes and
through our lessons so growing up online
has been such a bizarre thing and
something you can't understand unless
you go through it yourself I have been
scrutinized every single day of my life
so this has been my job and from that
scrutiny it caused
a lot of issues within myself I'm
turning 24 this year I feel as though
for the first time in my life I'm
starting to reach a point of accepting
myself and loving myself and in order to
get there completely there's the last
few things that I need to change so what
I want to talk about is facetune
Photoshop photos all that kind of stuff
now I am someone who you know I in the
past have obviously edited my photos and
when I refer to editing in this video
what I mean is like warping my body to
make it look skinnier warping my face to
make it look slimmer all that kind of
stuff
I don't really airbrush photos or
anything like that but it got so bad at
one point but I didn't even recognize
that it was me so this facetune weird
self image thing all kind of stemmed
from you know I was 19 years old 20
years old and I started this YouTube
channel and it was a really fun exciting
creative place and I really really
enjoyed it and then I can't believe it
could she become a job it was just my
blog that I could do this as well as
work I've come so far from where I used
to be but I think of myself like four
years ago and I was in such a different
space in terms of self-esteem and stuff
that when I would receive negative
comments back when I was younger it
would stick with me so hard and
ultimately I got a lot of self-esteem
issues from that so I had someone once
said at my face was like really chubby
from the front or my jaw was something
about my jaw I care about the comments
in exactly but when I read that my
reaction was I need to change that so
that I'll be accepted more because
there's obviously something wrong with
me
and I won't be accepted as I am and as I
am isn't enough and I truly believe that
like that's that is the level of
insecurity that I used to feel so I
discovered the world of editing and I
began to like walk my jaw to make it
straighter or if there was a photo of my
body I realized you know you kind of
make you always go in a little bit make
yourself look you have a bigger bomb or
ever and it was so addicting like so
addicting if any of you have ever edited
a photo you'll understand it like it's
it's a weird addiction it is because
once you start doing it you have to keep
doing it to keep up the consistency of
what you're putting out there that you
look like that you don't really look
like so it's like a dangerous thing was
falling down the rabbit hole of editing
and editing and ever seen and it would
get to a point where I couldn't upload a
photo and this was edited I was so
obsessed with changing the way I look to
feel like out fit in more if I look
different and as a lot of you know I was
bullied through school and because of
that I kind of grew up believing that
Who I am isn't enough so it's been a
really long journey for me to gain
self-love and just to accept Who I am
because for so many years of my life
I've been told by strangers on the
internet and people in real life that
that I'm ugly that there's something
wrong with me pointing out stuff with my
features on my body or my personality
that is right and I hid who I was from
the world so I saw that I had this
channel and I thought I think people
will like me more if I'm more like the
other girls so I would wear things that
other people would wear I would make
videos of who would make but although I
enjoyed creating it it wasn't me and I'm
talking here more like kind of to
three years ago back when I was a blonde
basically I never knew who I was because
I was always told that I wasn't enough
like everyone around me except like my
mum and dad you know and I believed it I
truly did believe it and I got to a
point where yeah I hid myself away
because in real life if any of you have
met me I'm very shy very all good I am a
nerd at heart you know my favorite
things in the world are like reading and
baking and playing games and watching
like really dark crime series and stuff
I've had to fake being confident so much
that I'm a pro at it to the point that
when people meet me at events they think
that I'm stuck up because I'm really shy
in real life and they can't understand
like why I can be one way my videos but
different in real life and it's because
I have become a pro at molding myself
into someone that I feel people accept
me as more and as time went on it just
became normal for me to face June it
became so normal but I didn't even think
about it
and it wasn't until I was recently on a
few brand trips as you guys know I've
been on a few recently but also went on
a few like at the start of the year and
I really took a step back and looked at
everything
from an outsider's point of view and I
did have a bit of an epiphany because
social media and everyone that's there
will paint it out to be the most
incredible amazing fantastic brilliant
party in the world but a lot of the time
when a lot of influences are together in
the same place it's just about like a
three hour photo shoot getting heaps of
photos and then another three hours of
everyone just sitting at a table on
their phones no eye contact no talking
just sitting there
editing themselves I just stopped by for
what the hell
are we doing why is this normal and why
are we doing this and I just thought
about all the girls that follow me who
I've said things like I wish I knew body
I wish you know I look like you and this
and that and I think like but I don't
even look like that we don't even look
like that we are contributing to this
problem I'm being such a hypocrite how
can I like how on earth can I put out a
photo about body acceptance and
self-love if that photo is edited I have
done that so many times because I would
look around me and look at what everyone
else looks like and I want to look like
them so bad to fit in that I just was
never happy with just being me not so
much happy but I never felt like it was
enough and it would never be validated
and never be accepted by people so I was
stuck in this world where nothing was
real it took me to a point where I
really stopped and thought about
everything that I'm doing and I'm
contributing to this issue and I used to
use a camera which airbrushed me and I
used to use a lens which was a wide lens
which actually would kind of make me
look skinnier because everything in the
middle would go like inwards that was
normal to me I was so used to myself
being distorted that I actually found a
lens that would distort me and make my
skin blurry and clear and that was the
first thing to go for me because I
thought the video is the rawest form of
Who I am and that is even distorted by
just what the hell am i doing so a few
months ago I switched to using this
camera which is the canon g7x mark ii i
had to read it the Nikon is it it
doesn't edit you these will be exactly
what you see is what I am and that was
the first thing the whole airbrushing
camera that went and that was a huge
thing for me to put up a video oh my oh
my god everyone could see my face so
clearly now and see what I actually
looked like and I was terrified but no
one really noticed you know no one was
like oh my god you look so different
they were just like Oh finally a camera
with better quality so I just thought
like I was I so scared like everyone has
been so lovely about it and then that
led me to be so much more comfortable in
my videos now as we know I am a
professional sitting aside on on the
camera and shown the left side of my
face and that all stems from various
insecurities that I literally would go
out of my way to hide this side of my
face as much as I possibly could because
I felt like it was so different to this
of my face and it is so stupid isn't it
like there are so many more issues in
the world and I was that insecure that I
would sit like this and I got to a point
a few months ago in my videos where I
was able to talk to the camera straight
on just as I am now and not be afraid
I'm not no where nearly I'm not their
prettiest person in the world and we all
have unflattering angles we all know how
to take a good photo we all know what
pose we like and it's my job so I've had
to learn what I feel most comfortable
doing and I just decided that my left
side would make me look slimmer because
my jaw would look straighter and
whatever then my right side so I
essentially just stuck with it but of
course if my hair is up because my hair
is a bit of a curtain my hair is a
curtain because I'm a lot more
self-conscious than people think and I
use it in a way to kind of hide my face
so it's very rare for me to ever put up
a video in my hairs but
and if I ever do it please no it's
really like a massive thing for me to do
that but in life I've always had my hair
down because it's like a comfort blanket
to me I got to a point a few months ago
I stopped using the airbrush camera and
then the next step for me the biggest
step was to delete a face tune from my
phone so i did that and i removed the
app and for about a month straight i put
up photos that were not skewed they were
me just with like a pretty filter on
them and i felt more beautiful in those
photos than they ever did about
something that was edited because it was
me and I felt proud that I'd finally
gotten to a point of like accepting
myself and knowing that I'm enough and
not to stop hiding and it was going so
well then I went on a brand trip
recently a few weeks ago now where I was
like I literally did her face you know I
was just there and putting up photos as
they were taken just with a filter and
throwing it up and I was sitting in a
group and I was probably like 12 of us
and everyone was taking photos and I
kind of again wasn't noticing myself so
I sat down I looked around everyone and
anyway I can explain it it's always like
if you're a smoker and you're sitting in
smokers room and someone offers you a
cigarette like that's how I felt and I
just felt like oh my god should I be
editing to like my photos one look
anyway I was near as beautiful as theirs
and everyone's gonna think I'm a rubbish
content creator with my ugly broad
photos whatever but I I remember Reed
unloading it and I used it on one photo
to like I think it was on my face but I
definitely have stepped away from
editing my body and it started to creep
in again a little bit but no I need to
extend and what it did when I was blonde
that's what it was the worst I literally
look at some photos
whoa I went so far with the editing it's
just insane but it does make me sad in a
way to realize that a girl like me the
girl that was doing that was very broken
on the inside and felt that was the only
way she'd get people to like her and I
realized that now I realized that's why
I was doing it was to conform to fit in
to feel validated to feel accepted and
it got so addicting and today I wanted
to come clean to you guys to say that
from here onwards I'm not going to be
skewing photos anymore because why like
honestly
why and I hope that you realize that a
lot of the things you see online aren't
real
the blood the photo is you compare
yourselves to aren't real they're
enhanced and they're an illusion I guess
is the best word I'm hope by stepping
forward and making this video and
admitting my wrongs and also I want to
apologize to you for what I've done
I really hope more than anything this
can lead other influences to also delete
to decide decide to delete face Jing CEO
what about is that too late to decide
anyway it would be great if other
influences join me on this to stop
skewing faces to stop skewing bodies I
think filters are okay because they make
everything look pretty but as long as
like the person themselves look like
they do in real life that's what I mean
because we're all comparing ourselves to
an illusion that's just ridiculous and
this is me this is who I am like I'm
being so open with you right now that I
am Lucci like holding my hands because
I'm shaking and we're in a video form
you guys can see this is exactly what I
look like this is my face this is my
face front on and
I'm just I'm so done I'm done I'm done
I'm done with sending out a false image
of Who I am and being a hypocrite you
know I can't I can't stand by accepting
yourself if I don't accept myself and I
feel by putting this out there to you
this means I can put this behind me and
move on in this new newspaper that like
no more skewing photos my camera is
obviously telling me to wrap it up so
that's for me I want to address before
closing this up but I am so excited to
to finally reach a point in my life
where I'm accepting and embracing myself
being me and I'm so close I've been
through so much that so many people
don't know and for me to be able to get
here now as corny as I am proud of
myself and I do hope that this can start
a movement in some way to kind of delete
facetune because it's not doing any good
you know it's just toxic and unnecessary
because all the girls that I meet on
these trips all the other influences
they're so beautiful person I just think
like what drives us to feel like we have
to alter who we are what we look like
just so that people will like our photos
when these girls are gorgeous I wanted
to come clean about this because I feel
like I owe you an apology for feeling as
though I've deceived people in the past
and just know that from now on there's
no more hiding like this is me this is
who I am I'm gonna do my stealing edits
with my annotations because I love
making you guys laugh and I'm just
growing up and putting my past behind me
in any normal person in the world could
do this without having to make
yeah but this is my life and I just feel
yeah I'm ready to move on and put all
that stuff behind me so I do really
appreciate you watching it to the end I
understand it's a very long video and
I'm very sorry about that I will have a
really happy video on Sunday which is my
creep vlog I'm very excited if you guys
see that but I'm so relieved now that
I've said all this and I will chat to
you on Sunday
so until then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
