and I have like a constant headache and
stuff and I can't sleep so I can't film
a proper sit-down videos in this state
sorry I thought that I just flogged
anyway because I'm well enough to
actually blog but not well enough to do
a house tour is what I wanted to film
about anyway my family today uh coming
down to see my house and see Braaten I'm
so excited about it like I'm so annoyed
at myself being sick
I hate mmm I don't want them to catch it
this is horrible at some point I have to
get the energy to get out of bed and
actually like clean the house and
honestly like my body is in so much pain
that I just can't even do it but I'm
gonna film their reaction to button and
like how they feel that and everything
that's what this vlog is gonna be it's
gonna be very homely very
family-orientated
and I'm gonna look like absolute deaf in
this flaw oh okay we're on the move
it's like anything that I could stomach
at the moment so I've got my lemsip
which is amazing it makes you feel so
much better
tea and then some honey on to Aloha so
I've had a shower I've pumped a bunch of
medication into my system and now I'm
going to clean up this absolute mess tip
of a room which I shall film myself
doing for you guys now a bit of an
organization stuff all that kind of good
stuff but my voice just sucks all right
now I wanted to stop being so guys the
cutest thing ever just happened like
literally I can't believe that she did
this I was just like oh so you guys
might know Amy if you don't then search
Amy Rose Walker on YouTube and she's
such a sweetheart I swear to god I got a
knock at my door and I got a card from
her which is like a get well soon card
nose like that is the cutest thing I
have ever seen
also I have to go to the tip at some
point get rid of all this cardboard I
can't wait for that well I'm feeling
Target that all I'm like productive mode
I can function I can actually do
anything I'm gonna try and clean my
heart out right now whoo
so that's pretty much den bedroom is
clean you'll smell like accomplish to
have a clean room it's so nice I can
already feel myself starting to
deteriorate again so I'm gonna quickly
finish up the kitchen and then have a
break
because I really shouldn't be cleaning
no I don't know what I'm doing so we are
now building a wardrobe because I'm
ridiculous and I shouldn't be doing but
my parents need someone to hang their
clothes up so need to do what I need to
do not used to being a host as well so
this is all just like really creates me
good way though like I would love people
would stay at my place like all the time
but it's just super weird that like I'm
hosting my family like that's never
happened yeah I am gonna build a photo
and then I'm going to have some more
medicine and lie down because I need to
stop I need to go to the tip but I just
can't be bothered like only house out in
the cold right now so I might have to
hold that off and I just went in the
Attic for God's sake I really try so
hard to impress my family it's so sad
this really hurt okay so the house is
mostly clean now I'm in so much pain I
can't even explain to you I know this is
just a lot of complaining but I can't
film anything except this kind of a
video because I just can't even function

this before my body is just aching like
so much but I've just popped myself with
some medicine now I hope that I feel
better soon because my family should be
here in like two hours I'm gonna try
slate but I'm just like annoyed with
myself because I don't want to be sick
