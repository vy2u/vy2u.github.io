today's video I'm starting it off with
my bare face I wanted to quickly before
I get started let you know that this is
going to be a 100% drugstore tutorial
which I can't believe I haven't done yet
on my channel I'm actually really
disappointed that I've never done that
before I'm gonna try to incorporate more
drugstore brands for you guys because I
know we got to be glam on a budget so I
went to the drugstore today it picked up
a bunch of products that looked
interesting to me or that I just have
been wanting to try and I want to do a
really really glam holiday look for you
guys let's go ahead and get started
first thing I'm gonna do is my eyebrows
this is by Maybelline it's the brow
drama palette it's a powder trio here
I'm gonna be picking up this middle
color here I also want to point out to
you guys that I know I'm not using
drugstore brushes that is really hard to
find okay I tried I have drugstore
brushes here that I'm going to be using
I tried I just couldn't find enough
brushes that I needed so I will be using
some of my regular brushes this is the
Mac 263 brush so I like to start by
creating just the shape that I want of
my brow actually made too much of a
harsh line here so I'm just gonna just
buff it out real quick
I will say I actually tried this on
Katie's eyebrow right before filming
this and this powder is very pigmented
which I like a lot of times when you're
filling in your brows with powder it
doesn't do the job because they're not
pigmented enough and it just ends up
looking lighter than the rest of your
brow but this one's pretty good so I'm
just gonna create hair like strokes
throughout the whole thing give myself a
little volume I always do the inner part
of my brow last because I try to keep
the least amount of product in the front
of the brows and then the darkest color
I'm going to use in these bald spots
here so this is my brow filled in and
then this is the bald brow I actually
really like this powder it's a perfect
tone for my hair colors we're brow gel I
picked up the Maybelline brow drama in
the shade blonde sculpting brow mascara
moving on to shadow I'm gonna be using
the Jessie's Girl I shadow primer
a lot of people think that when I'm not
wearing eye shadow that I'm wearing eye
shadow because my crease is so dark I
just have really bad pigmentation
usually I like to use Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot because it like cancels out
all of the redness on my eyes I can put
a really cool brown in my crease and
it's still gonna look warm we're gonna
go ahead and set that primer with the
wet and wild coverall pressed powder
here I always need to set my eyeshadow
primer because I like to blend powders
on top of powders it just has a smoother
application especially if you have um
oily lids you definitely want to set
primers especially one like this I feel
like my eyeshadow is still going to
crease with this primer because it's
like kind of slippery if you will I
think I'm gonna move on to foundation
actually because I'm breaking out I'm
gonna use foundations that I already
love from the drugstore just because
these are my two favorites I've been
mixing these two together this is the
L'Oreal infallible Pro matte which gives
really good coverage and this is the
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
this one isn't as matte as this one for
some reason I mix them together one day
and it was just like the perfect
combination the L'Oreal infallible I'm
in the shade 108 just going to take a
dollop of that this is in the shade 228
and I mix this one and you want to mix
them together pop it all oh I forgot
primer ah it's too late guys I forgot
primer but just so you know I was gonna
try the loriel magic perfecting base
dammit they're a meme when you realize
you forget to apply primer I'll be using
the Real Techniques makeup sponge for
this so far the Beauty Blender one has
always been my favorite but for any
other blender out there this one
definitely is in second for me it's
really really good I like the other one
more because I feel like it's softer a
little bit softer there's a lot out
there that are just like so hard that
when you try to use them it's basically
like you're just punching yourself in
the face I'm gonna have a mole here real
quick just that you guys know we're
gonna move on to eyes and then do
concealer last for the eyes I'm going to
start off by using this the nudes
palette also by Maybelline I'm actually
going to go into this topi shade right
here I'm using a deli M tools brush
these are really affordable brushes I'm
going to run that into my crease I'm
actually gonna be bringing that down
into my lid space as well
just about halfway so far so good this
eyebrow struggling though can you see it
it is struggling the brow gel is not
holding up my hairs down the struggle
bus right now this is a really pretty
color actually it's very soft very
subtle next I'm going to go into this
deeper shade of brown here and darken
the crease up a little bit more just
gonna do the same thing taking a little
bit of the same brush I'm just gonna put
it into the crease wanting to keep all
these colors cooler on the cooler side
so we're gonna be doing the stuff with
silver deep in that it shows are really
nice
I want to focus most of this color on to
the crease but I'm dragging everything
onto the lid as well just lightly so
once I start applying these darker
colors you want to take a clean blending
brush to blend out the edges you don't
want to use the same brush you're
applying color with to blend out the
edges or else you're just gonna get a
shadow everywhere just one clean one on
the side is how you keep your smoky eyes
looking not muddy it's very useful tip
I'm gonna take the light shade in the
palette here I'm gonna highlight the
brow bone area and then blend it into
the crease with that clean brush that we
have alright we're gonna move on to the
silver part of the look I've always been
wanting to try these but I've never
gotten around to it these are the
L'Oreal Paris infallible shadows I'm
gonna go ahead and dip into this one
it's in the shade seven five seven
silver take a Smith 304 brush this is
actually a lip brush but I'm going to
use it to pack this on what I'm gonna do
with this is create a thick wing so
first I'm making a line across a really
thick line all the way across my eyelid
space and I'm gonna take angled brush
the same one I used to do my brows I'm
just cleaning it off on the back of my
hand cleaning it off I'm going to create
a wing with this see I'm glad I waited
to do my concealer cuz I'm having a
little bit of fallout happening here so
this is gonna be a base we're actually
gonna put glitter on top of this so if
there's some spots that don't seem as
opaque it's fine
so I'm just gonna go ahead and do the
same thing on the other eye your back
next I'm picking up this wet-and-wild
glitter apply it along the wing to make
it more glittery
so this glitter is a little bit hard to
work with but once you get it you can
get like the little particles to stick
I'm just going to keep building up the
glitter on the wing I'm taking a
Neutrogena face wipe and I'm going to
clean up all this glitter that fell on
my under eye and eye shadow fall out I'm
debating whether I want to put a thin
black liner under this so once I do the
lower lash line and feel it out I will
see I'm gonna use the Maybelline master
conceal this is in the shade medium it's
very very full coverage I got this Real
Techniques setting brush should I use
this for setting yeah all right I'm
gonna take a little bit of this stipple
it on the under eyes hopefully it's not
too thick so I'm setting it here and
then working my way up to the top so
that I have the least amount of product
under my eyes especially since this is a
thicker concealer you want to keep
smallest amount towards your under eye
that was like a concealer to cover my
under-eye pigmentation now with the
maybelline instant age rewind I'm gonna
use this to highlight my face I love
this I've been using it for so many
years now it's one of my favorite
drugstore products this is a really
glamorous look so I'm going glamorous
with the face makeup as well full
coverage full coverage taking the Real
Techniques Beauty Blender I'm blending
that in oh and this is in the shade
neutralizer I found with this concealer
that it sets really fast sometimes it's
best to do one eye at a time because I
can already tell this side set a little
bit and it's harder to blend to set my
under eye I'm gonna use the wet and wild
powder that I used earlier and I'm just
gonna use the same Real Techniques brush
because I used a matte foundation I
don't think I'm gonna set the rest of my
face I don't want to look too dry or
cakey I just want you guys to know that
I'm gonna go ahead and create a little
Mole right here over my pimple again
I love what I do this Stevens always
like oh you have a new beauty work today
you already know that this is why I'm
doing it cuz I'm trying to cover a
pimple I'm just gonna put a little
powder over it to make it look like I
put a little makeup over it I have new
moles every day now finishing off the
lower lash line so I'm gonna go ahead
and smoke out my lower lash line a lot
and this is l'oreal paris extra intense
liquid eyeliner pencil extra bit i'm
gonna do a super smoked out lower lash
line applying it messy and i'm gonna
take this small detail brush blend it
out smudge it before it sets give it
that nice sexy blend i like to put a
little bit more block after i buff it
out just to get the waterline really
dark so i'm going to go back into the
taupe color from this palette that we
used in the crease right here i'm just
going to take that and blend out the
black on the lower lash line with a
fluffier brush very lightly think i'm
going to take a little bit more of this
silver glitter and i'm going to go ahead
and take this liner and also tight line
my eyes with it
i'm just kind of dragging this right
along this outer part but now i'm going
to add some mascara this one is by
maybelline and it's the falsies push-up
drama i didn't realize i grabbed so much
Maybelline so I'm just gonna apply a few
coats of this you guys know my eyelashes
are teeny tiny so I'm gonna coat as much
of my lashes as I can as we're gonna
apply falsies next it's time for lashes
and these are a pair of our Adele lashes
that I've worn before and I just added a
few of the Ardell individuals to the
outer part of it to make it a little bit
fuller always dip an individual lash and
some glue and keep building on your
lashes if you want more fullness and
then I'm going to let these dry and
apply a lot of mascara to make them pop
even more so after I applied a little
bit of mascara onto the lashes and I'm
just going to push them up with my
fingers to just open up the eyes so I
like to use lashes like this just
because you can see the liner through
them the one of ours
the show alright let's finish off the
face found true match and c6 it looks a
bit warm but I figured it would kind of
be like my Mac give me Sun bronzer
hopefully it's not too warm pretty warm
looks good though actually yeah girl if
you're looking for a good face powder
honestly these are so good
the blushes are really nice I used to
use this powder all the time it glides
on really nice and it has a lot of
pigmentation oh isn't it Oh like I said
these powders are really pigmented for
blush I'm going to use the Revlon
naughty naughty nude it's a very neutral
color I'm gonna do red lips with this
look so it's gonna be very very intense
and you want your blush to be subtle
when you're wearing so much intense
makeup everywhere else just gonna be
like a nice subtle neutral shade
highlight true test this is the Revlon
bronze glow a clot equate some French
word that I don't know how to say bronze
looks like this I'm gonna try to pick up
these top shades here that's pretty good
ochre oh this is actually really nice
now it's time for lips I'm gonna go
ahead and go really bold with this look
a red lip just to keep it super festive
this is the revlon colorstay lip crayon
in red Rouge so I'm first gonna apply
this and then I'm gonna go over top of
that with L'Oreal Paris red infallible I
picked this cuz I felt like it was the
closest thing to a liquid lipstick and I
love liquid lipsticks because they just
stay on
to go over the entire lip with the lip
liner
so now that I felt in my entire lip with
the lip liner I'm gonna go in with the
L'Oreal red and fallible ok so there's
something really interesting about this
liquid lipstick it's so sticky like look
is that horrible my lips are like sticky
together I think I have to let it like
dry forever I'm gonna try to set it with
a little bit of this powder oh it's
better not my favorite sorry L'Oreal
alright guys so this is the finished
makeup look what do you guys think I out
of all of these products and really
impressed there's only a few of it I
wasn't a fan of but a lot of them were
really really good especially these
l'oreal infallible this is really nice
the texture the pigmentation a one that
i actually got a few other colors the
bronze the black Java the gold and
silver oh my god I got a lot of them
these I highly recommend this True Match
powder is also amazing if you guys need
a setting powder or even as a bronzer I
really really liked this this eyeliner
really really good so I really liked a
lot of these products there were only a
few that I was like maybe not let me
