them so much I physically cannot look at
cotton balls I can't see other people
touching cotton it just makes me feel
uncomfortable in my body kind of like
that feeling people get when there's
like nails on a chalkboard it makes me
cringe when I was in first grade I had
to do a paint project where we did a
painting with cotton balls and I refused
to participate I had no idea why I just
didn't want to do it I got in trouble
the teacher talked to my parents about
it I just said I didn't want to touch
the cotton and I never knew that it was
a thing until I got older and I realized
I have a phobia of cotton balls is the
weirdest thing ever so there's that

started Steven taught me blade and
like how to drag the clips down and then
I just taught myself everything and

watched a YouTube video never really did
special-effects makeup or anything like
that and then I just did it on Stephen

compliments and people started asking
like oh do you do this for hire and I
was just like yeah of course I do which
I didn't but I'm not gonna say no you
should always say yes to an opportunity
that you want right so I just said yeah
of course I do bookings I didn't so I
had to go out and buy like all the stuff
do makeup for people and I started doing
Halloween makeup then people it was like

hire me for Halloween makeup and that's
how I fell into it if I would have never
