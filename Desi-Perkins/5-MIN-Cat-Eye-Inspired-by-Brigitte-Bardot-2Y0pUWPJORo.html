wanted to do this really quick 5-minute
Cateye
inspired by the gorgeous Brigitte Bardot
she was always so glamorous but
effortless and that's why I thought this
would be a perfect look so let's start
off with applying a matte brown
eyeshadow to the lid and I'm just gonna
keep this close to the lash line and
begin to form a cat-like shape with this
shadow in a lot of pictures of Brigitte
Bardot I saw that she really liked to
use black as well so if you guys want a
more dramatic look then you can
definitely use black shadow instead of
this brown one
after I've packed on that shadow in the
shape that I like I'm going to take a
blending brush and I'm just going to
blend out those edges and if you lose
some of the pigmentation go ahead and
pack a little bit more eyeshadow on and
then blend it once again well after
we've quickly applied that shadow we're
going to move on to eyeliner and this is
benefits they're real push-up liner it's
their new liner I'm really excited to
try it actually it's basically a gel
formula and you push it up through the
applicator and the applicator is shaped
like an angled brush so it makes it
really easy to create that wing after we
finished that winged liner we're gonna
run that dark brown eye shadow on our
lash line once again and then take that
liner and just line the outer part of
our lower lash line as well making sure
to stay out of the waterline
I noticed that brigitte bardot does this
and a lot of her makeup looks now you're
just gonna want to apply some mascara
this is benefit they're real you guys
can definitely stop at mascara but I'm
gonna apply false lashes because you
guys know I always have to apply false
lashes but what I did was I cut one pair
in half and I'm just gonna apply them to
the outer corners and by cutting them in
half it makes it so much easier to apply
and quicker and that completes our
5-minute cat eye I hope you guys enjoyed
the tutorial thumbs up if you did thank
you guys so much for watching and I'll
see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
