eyelashes ready to go don't you think I
would have known that this wasn't gonna

like regular eye shadow I'm just
wondering what was happening over there
I feel like maybe something could have
changed in ten minutes it's like five
minutes you're going that was it yeah
I'm so upset right how that happens you
played yourself you used a foundation
you've never used before without knowing
your shade I would have just made myself
tan I don't know why you went in Reverse

but I don't know alright so that is it
for the five minute makeup challenge
