guys welcome back to my channel today I
actually decided to film a hair tutorial
for you since it's been a while since
I've actually had one on my channel and
I've been really inspired by the 60s
lately so I thought I would just do my
take on a 60s hair style it's a really
simple half updo I'm gonna show you guys
how I curled it and put it up I think
that's it so with that said let's get
started to start off this hairstyle I'm
gonna go ahead and suction half of my
hair up and clip it with a clippie clip
and actually prior to filming I also
clipped in some hair extensions so if
you guys want extra volume and length
you can go ahead and do that but if you
already are blessed with beautiful
luscious hair then don't worry about it
now I'm going to take 1 to 2 inch
sections of my hair and I'm gonna start
curling them with a two inch curling
iron and when you're curling your hair
you want to make sure to curl the pieces
away from your face and you want to curl
all the pieces the exact same direction
and make sure to bring the hair all the
way down to the ends in the curling iron
because you want to make sure that you
know you get those ends in there if you
were doing a beach wave you would leave
the ends out but for the wave we're
trying to do you want to make sure you
get those little guys and I'm just going
to continue this process on the other
side as well
next you want to take down the front two
sections of your hair and curl those
pieces as well and like I said earlier
make sure that all the pieces are being
curled in the same direction and I just
realized after doing this hairstyle that
it's a really good hairstyle for a
second day third day fourth day fifth
day you know I'm not judging but if your
hair is dirty and you need a hairstyle
this is definitely a good way to cover
up dirty hair once you're done curling
those front two sections take down the
rest of your hair and curl those pieces
as well
so now that I'm done curling my hair I
want to loosen those curls and turn them
into weaves so I'm gonna use my blow
drying brush this is the caviar a larger
round brush and I like this brush
because it has a wooden handle so it's
not gonna snag your hair and I'm gonna
go ahead and use this to brush out my
curls and turn them into weaves
something about the bristles is really
gonna smooth out the hair and as you can
see instead of being curls now it's a
soft wave which is what we want we don't
want it to look super curled I usually
always do this when I curl my hair
because I'm not a fan of really together
curls I like more of a body wave now
it's time for the fun part which is it
teasing the hair I'm gonna brush the
front section back and then I'm gonna
start taking one to two inch sections
and achieving them run a little
hairspray through them as well and then
you know T's look beautiful do a little
dance to dirty hip-hop because that's
what I'm doing and I'm gonna continue to
take small sections and tease them the
smaller the section the better the et's
teasing actually isn't that great for
your hair so don't do it often but you
know every once in a while it's alright
looking good
does he look in good
now take your hairspray and just spray
that ish all over the place now you're
just gonna flip all that hair forward
and I'm going to use that teasing brush
to brush all of those hairs back but you
want to do it really lightly cuz you
don't want to brush out your teasing and
I chose to take out two front pieces of
my hair you guys can pull all of it back
or you can take out your bangs whatever
tickles your fancy and I'm going to use
that brush just to smooth the very front
of the hairstyle and after I've smoothed
out most of it I'm just gonna start
shaping it with my hand
you can also pull some of the hair out
just to even out the dome that's what
I'm gonna call it the dome now I'm just
gonna take that the hair that I've
pulled back and I'm gonna twist it
lightly not too tight because you want
it to be more fluffy I guess I'm gonna
twist it lightly and then I'm just gonna
wrap it around itself and go ahead and
take a bobby pin and pan that bun into
place
I'm just gonna use the pointy side of
the teasing comb to kind of pull and
even out the dome and now just to give
it the sides of my hair a little bit of
volume I'm just gonna lightly tease them
and then to smooth out our waves once
more I'm gonna take the round brush
again and just kind of give it one last
brush so when I finish my hairstyle I
always like to add a little something to
give my hair more shine and softness so
I'm going to use this CC cream for your
hair which I've never heard of but I
guess it's the first of its kind this is
the alternate caviar CC cream and I'm
just gonna run that through my hair
mostly focusing on the ends because it's
gonna help with moisture and this is
actually also a heat protectant so
before I blow dried my hair I also put
this up in there and then in true woman
fashion I'm gonna go a little crazy with
the hairspray and make sure to get it
all over my hair just so it holds those
curls nicely voila
I decided to add one last finishing
touch my friend Kristin Dominique here
on YouTube but let me borrow this really
cute headpiece it's from forever 21 and
I just popped that on my hair to add you
know a little flare and that is the
finished look I hope you guys enjoyed
