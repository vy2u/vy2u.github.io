about the seven eye brushes that I
cannot live without number one
so the first brush that I always use is
a spoolie I use this to groom my
eyebrows before I lay down any product
that way all the hairs are facing the
exact same direction this will make your
eyebrows look neater and it will also
help you blend out any product that you
put in your brow number two this is my
Holy Grail eyebrow brush and it's the
Mac 263 I like this brush because it's
really sharp and really dense some
angled brushes can be kind of flimsy
which doesn't allow you to create those
brow like hairs and this one does reason
I like this is because it works really
well with gel products which I usually
use to do my eyebrows as a gel however
you could also use this for powder and I
feel like it doubles for both and you
get more for your money just buying this
one brush number three you want to have
a flat concealer brush this is the Sigma
F 75 brush and I use this to apply my
eyeshadow base and I also use it to
clean the bottom of my brow bone you
want to use a synthetic brush for an
eyeshadow base so that it takes care of
the bristles because if you use a brush
that has natural hairs it will ruin the
brush number four this is the Mac 239
brush this is the perfect brush for
small areas and packing on the shadow I
use this under the brow bone as well as
on the lid number five this is the Mac
two to four and I call it the eraser
brush because it really helps blend away
any imperfections that you may have laid
down in your crease and I also use this
to apply my transition shade I like this
brush a lot because it's super fluffy
really soft and it really gets into the
crease while diffusing other shadow
colors number six a blending brush I'm
using here the matte 217 which I really
love I love it because it has the right
density in order to target those really
defined areas while still giving you a
really nice blend a dupe for it would be
the Sigma blending brush and this is the
e 25 which is just as amazing
when I'm doing my makeup I pick up
either one of these whichever one I see
first so that right there tells me that
I love them equally number seven an
eyeliner brush and every one needs a
good eyeliner brush it's already
difficult as it is so you want to make
sure that you have a brush that suits
your needs and for me I found that this
paint brush tip is the best brush this
is just a generic brush it doesn't have
a name on it but I found a perfect dupe
for you guys it's the Sigma II ten and
it looks exactly the same so what I like
about it is that it's tapered so that it
really helps you get into the inner
corners and it really helps with the
flick on the outer corner as well and
that's why I love this style of brush so
yeah alright guys so those were my seven
favorite eye brushes I hope this video
was informative and you guys enjoyed it
I will definitely be following this up
with a favorite face brushes so stay
tuned for that and of course he's like
and subscribe love you guys bye
number four this is the max what is it
sorry good right number five number five
