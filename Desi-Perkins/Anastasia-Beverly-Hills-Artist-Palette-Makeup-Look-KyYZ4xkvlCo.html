today's video is going to be a makeup
tutorial and I'm going to be using the
new anastacio Beverly Hills artist
palette this palette is super colorful
so I didn't think I was gonna dig it as
much as I do but I ended up playing with
it one day and I was pleasantly
surprised that I loved it
i snapchatted a few videos wearing this
makeup look you guys loved it and wanted
a tutorial so here it is I'm going to
recreate it for you guys today so let's
go ahead and get started so the first
thing I'm going to do is apply Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot to my lids this is just
gonna give us like a nice even a shadow
base and it's going to make all the
bright colors appear even brighter
alright then I'm going to go ahead and
set my base using anasazi a Beverly
Hills shadow and this is in the shade
Blanc and I'm just taking a large shadow
brush and sweeping that over the base so
our blending is a lot easier alright so
the only eye shadow that I'm not really
using from the palette is going to be
this one it's also by honest Aussie
Beverly Hills it's called Sienna and I'm
taking my morphe m4 41 and I'm just
gonna use this as my transition shade in
the crease and we're not doing winged
liner today with this look because I
didn't wear it when I showed you guys
the look on snapchat so I'm keeping the
shape pretty round
feel free to flick it out if you prefer
and you want to do a wing so next I lied
I'm gonna actually use another eye
shadow from honest elf am because I want
to blend this out just a little bit it's
orange soda a similar color is Peach
Smoothie by makeup geek you guys have
that I'm just gonna pick up a little bit
of that and then lightly diffuse the
edges here I'm sorry I kind of already
started doing it on this side and then I
realized I wasn't filming so just
basically lightly buffing it all out so
it looks really smoky so now going into
the new artist palette by Anastasia
Beverly Hills I'm going to deepen the
crease using blue velvet right over here
and I'm just using my Mac 217 brush for
this so we're just really defining the
socket with this so when you do looks
that have a really bright lid you want
to make sure to do the crease work first
because if you do the lid and then the
crease you're basically just gonna make
it all muddy and
and the lid color will just start fading
and you're gonna have to like repack it
on so that's why my tutorials that
require a lot of blending in the crease
I always do my crease first next I'm
taking coal from the pallet which is a
nice cold color because the lid is going
to be really bright we need to define
the crease a little bit more than usual
so just taking a tiny bit of black
blending it in next I'm taking punch
fuchsia and I'm actually going to blend
this in the inner crease of our eye I'm
just going to really pop it in there
I've been really into placing eye
shadows in this area here lately I'm
just going to do the same thing to the
other eye you can see the difference it
really like warms up the eyes and kind
of just adds like a magical unicorn
touch to it I would say all right so for
the eye base when I did this look I used
only black I'm just a black gel liner
which you guys could totally do but I
want the blue to stand out just a little
bit more so I think I'm going to mix
these two eyes shadow bases this one is
a zoo by honest awesome over the hills
and this one is jet so I'm just gonna
kind of take a little bit of both and
apply those to my lid with a synthetic
brush and the brush I'm using for this
is a morphe g15 anytime I use bright
colors I like to use a similar base for
underneath it just because throughout
the day if the eyeshadow fades you don't
want it to fade into like skin color I
would rather it fade into something
similar so it doesn't look all blotchy
so now we're going to go back into the
palette and I'm going to take this
really pretty unicorn color it's
actually called unicorn and just pack
that all over the lid I'm using a little
tiny detail brush from Mac it's the 2 to
8 brush
so before we finish off the eyes I'm
going to go ahead and apply my concealer
you want to do this after the eyeshadows
because these bright colors may fall
right here and then you're just gonna
look Gracie so I'm just gonna apply my
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer and the
shade medium light give a nice little
triangle right here too and these little
deep crevices to blend out my concealer
I'm gonna use my Real Techniques brush
this is the sculpting brush which it has
a really nice angle so I like it
and you don't want to rub just do
patting motions and I'm just gonna take
my ELF blush brush and banana from
Anasazi of Beverly Hills and set my
under eye concealer real quick before I
finish off the eye look so for the under
eye I'm just gonna go ahead and line my
waterline with my Inglot gel liner this
is just in the color 77 which is also
known as black and I'm using my morphe
angled brush all right so I just put the
black gel liner under my eyes and now
I'm gonna blend it out with Sienna same
eyeshadow we used in the crease I'm just
gonna use the Smashbox little angled
brush this is the double exposure brush
came in my little palette and then I'm
going to take that angled brush with a
little bit of the black eyeshadow the
Col color and just apply a little bit
more of that on the outer corners of my
lower lash line to really smoke it out
and then I'm going to go ahead and add a
little bit more of that punch fuchsia to
the inner part of this eye look as well
alright and then for the inner corner
highlight I'm just going to go ahead and
use electro this is also by anastacio
and I'm going to pop that in the inner
corner of my eye as a highlight
all right guys so I'm using a new pair
of lashes today I'm using House of
lashes icon next I'm going to go ahead
and apply some bottom lashes off-camera
these are the House of lashes precious
bottom lashes alright so these are the
eyes done now we're just going to finish
off the face I already applied my
foundation I used this new foundation
it's the ex1 this isn't the shade 300 F
300 so I already use this and you guys
saw my concealer so now we're just gonna
go ahead and bronze the skin I'm gonna
use this new bronzer by Make Up For Ever
it is called the pro bronzed fusion in
the shade 351 I believe so I'm just
gonna warm up my skin with this and I'm
using the Mac 160 Brown scale bronze
okay so next I'm gonna contour using my
honest hacia contour kit of course I'm
just gonna kind of mix some of these
colors to go along and contour bit gotta
get them hot chick mom I'm also gonna
contour my nose slightly just ever so
slightly applying a little bit of the
banana powder from the contour kit down
the center of the nose just to make it
look perfectly straight alright so now
to highlight the skin
I'm gonna use my mary-lou manizer by the
balm and I'm using my Mac two to four
brush I've been using this to highlight
lately because it's fluffy and it fits
right in this little area right here so
just kind of circular motions just to
get right at the top of the cheekbone
cuz know I love that highlight I'm also
going to place a little bit of that
right above the brow and then I'm also
going to place a little bit of that on
the tip of my nose is it mom mom my mom
so for blush I'm just gonna use one of
my favorites this is MAC Cosmetics
peaches blush I make this weird face
when I apply blush like
but it just gives you like the perfect
Apple and then to really set the
highlight and make everything nice and
luminous I like to spray fix+ just in
these areas where I put the highlight
because it makes it more highlight II
think I'm going to also apply a little
bit of the highlighter on the Cupid's
bow so I'm going to line my lips quickly
with this lipliner from la girl it's
called natural so for the lips I'm going
to go with nude this is aa Nastasia
Beverly Hills undressed
it's a beautiful lip gloss that's
basically a liquid lipstick because it's
super pigmented alright guys so that is
