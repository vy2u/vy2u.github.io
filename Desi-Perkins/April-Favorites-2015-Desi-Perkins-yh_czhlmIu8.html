today I'm gonna do my favorites of march
a week one month Iran so today's video
is going to be my April favorites I have
a few really solid products here that I
have been absolutely loving and excited
to share them with you and let's just go
ahead and get right into it okay so the
first thing that I have here for you
guys is the Sun bum sea salt spray I
shared this on my snapchat and I told
you guys that I've been loving it
sea salt sprays for me are kind of just
like I don't know they're whatever
they're alright like they never really
made me feel any type of way
this one is phenomenal I've been wearing
my hair super beachy like you guys saw
in my tutorial this gives so much volume
and so much texture it doesn't give you
a bad phrase it gives you an amazing
beachy like you were just came out of
the ocean and you're one of those girls
who has beachy hair that dries
beautifully even though maybe that's not
the case because it definitely isn't
with me but this stuff makes it amazing
Mac mineralized charged water moisture
eye cream I have the hardest time trying
to find an eye cream that I really love
I always find I creams that I like and
the problem with eye creams is that a
lot of them tend to be too heavy for my
under eye area because it is a really
delicate skin but mostly I have
sensitive skin in general so when I try
certain under eye creams they're almost
too thick and then I get little bumps
like little I don't know how to explain
it I don't know if this happens to any
of you guys but I get little bumps from
the moisturizer being too thick for my
under eye area so if I find it a cream
that doesn't do that for me then I think
it's good cuz I just want a cream that's
gonna help and not give me a rash or a
breakout I guess this one I started
using I actually kind of purchase this
on accident because I wanted the the
giant moisturizer that they have of this
and I accidentally on the website ended
up purchasing this but I'm so happy that
I did because this is the most
refreshing under-eye cream I've ever
tried so far this month
I've been using it and it just makes me
feel super hydrated under the eyes it's
like a spa treatment when I put it on my
eyes because it's so cooling and light
it doesn't feel super thick it doesn't
make me break out as far as any like
long-term benefits I can't tell you guys
because obviously I've only been using
it this month but I can tell you that my
eye my under eye area is just so much
more plumpie and not all dry and cakey
like it can be sometimes so it's been
making my concealer look a lot better
and I've just been really liking it so
the Mac mineralized charged water eye
cream is the tits
you want a foundation this is a
foundation that I've loved in the past
and I kind of just got over it for some
reason maybe my skin changed my skin
type changes literally throughout the
year depending on the weather so I've
rediscovered the armani luminous silk
I'm in the shade of 7.5 which is my more
tan shade this is nothing new to any of
you guys I'm sure everyone on YouTube
talks about it literally because it is
amazing I don't know how I feel about
this when your skin is more oily because
it is very dewy but the trick that I do
with dewy foundations that I love the
finish but maybe I'm really oily here
and it doesn't work out for me in these
areas so I have a trick that I use this
all over my face
except the center and then in the center
I'll use a matte foundation and just
blend them together so that way I still
get the luminous look all over my face
but then the oily areas stay dry because
it can get a little too slick you know
what I'm saying so this stuff is
phenomenal and if you guys have oily or
skin in the t-zone maybe that's a trick
that could help you guys out but it's so
good it's beautiful coverage and it just
looks luminous like your skin looks the
bomb if you get the Armani luminous silk
foundation I highly recommend the Beauty
Blender to go hand-in-hand with it
because I've used it with the buffer
brush and it doesn't do it justice like
the Beauty Blender does this gives it a
totally different experience you know a
lot of people don't know exactly how to
use this some people try to use a dry do
not use it dry it's I've done it before
too when I first started using these but
you really want to soak it under the
water I mean not just lightly
dampen it like really soak it in the
water put it under the sink a few times
make sure you squeeze it up get all the
water in there because that's what's
gonna give it that bounce and you want
it to just kind of bounce off your skin
so moving on to another face product I
have the Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer you guys have been seeing me
use this in my videos lately and I know
that I was on the hunt for a really good
concealer and I had definitely found it
in this urban decay one I'll actually
prefer this over the NARS creamy
concealer that I've been using and it's
just my preference I still do think the
NARS is a great concealer but for some
reason I feel like this concealer once
it sets it likes stays put
Norah's cream and concealer for me maybe
moved around a little bit more than this
one does so I really like that this one
just kind of dries like your under eyes
are like but not in a like cakey dry
flaky way just it doesn't move around it
kind of just sets I'm in the shade
medium light neutral and it's a great
concealer okay so next you guys know I
love max give me son like I live for it
I want to bathe in it it's my favorite
bronzer
I've been alternating between Mac give
me son and this bronzer all month I've
been using the Too Faced chocolate
Soleil bronzer and this is in deep tan
it's a matte bronzer it's first of all I
love the packaging it's just so pretty
and it smells like chocolate so you know
I love that this is an amazing bronzer I
absolutely love it they come in
different shades depending on your skin
tone they smell amazing like I said
chocolate actually I've been told my
face smells like chocolate when I wear
this it blends beautifully the pigment
is so nice it's warmer it's on the
warmer side at least the shade I have is
on the warmer side which complements my
skin tone because I'm a little bit more
tan at the moment you don't want to use
a bronzer that's too cool toned if
you're tan because it may be gray on you
so I definitely like to pick up the more
warm bronzers but it's not too warm to
where I look like an oompa loompa it's
just the perfect amount of warmth and
I've been loving this to really just
give my whole face that nice no
next is my favorite contour brush that
I've been using this whole month and
it's the Mac 168 brush looks like this
it just has like this nice little angle
here it has bronzer on it because it's
dirty but this brush is just the right
size to get a really nice contour and
just fit right in these little
cheekbones here blends beautifully I
feel like it gives a sharp contour but
still blends because it's fluffy its
fluffy but it's also dense so you get
the best of both worlds a sharp contour
that gets blended out so the Mac 168
brush for contouring is the tips so the
two eyeshadows I've been loving this
month and basically using every time
I've gone out to the red carpet event
for the Avengers that you guys love my
makeup I was wearing these eyeshadows
and they are the color pop eyeshadows
that they did in collaboration with
kathleenlights I love her she's such a
cutie I just want to just want to
squeeze her she's so cute but uh this is
the kathleenlights shadow so I have it
on my lids now it's like the most
beautiful gold I just love it this is
actually the same eyeshadow I wore in
the meet my husband tag when you guys
all loved my makeup I was wearing this
gold eye shadow I've been mixing that
gold with the other eye shout out in the
quad the quad set that it comes with and
this is blaze wait does this one not
have a name oh this one is called
kathleenlights and this one is called
blaze okay I see bronze one that I'm
going to show you here it's such a
beautiful bronze like the perfect
perfect bronze eyeshadow so then the
last makeup item I have is the Anasazi
Beverly Hills lip gloss that they just
came out with and this is in the shade
undressed
of course the nude one is my favorite
this is I think the nudist
lip gloss that comes in the line and I
have just been loving it this is not
just like a normal lip gloss this is a
very pigmented it's pretty much like a
liquid lipstick that's glossy because
it's not just like a sheer it's not just
a sheer like look at that that's that's
a lip
SiC but it's glossy and I love it what's
oh it smells so good I'm like a sucker
for things that smell like cake
especially because I've been trying to
eat healthier sometimes I like put this
on my lips and I'm like so another thing
I've been loving this month it's non
beauty related kinda I guess yeah
not beauty related and it's this cute
little backpack here I've been going to
the beach a lot
and the pool mostly but I just love this
because I'll show you I this is by a
company called a sand cloud and let me
show you why it's so cool so it's just
this little backpack here and actually
believe it or not there's a pack in the
back right here for your laptop like my
laptop fits in here and a lot of the
times when I am laying out by the pool I
bring my laptop because I'm editing
always down there so so it's a little
backpack you can put all your stuff in
it put like my usual stuff my music
player or my cell phone or my sunblock
or my snacks inside this bag there's
something else
you just kind of pull it out this bag
actually turns into a large towel can
you guys so now it's not a backpack
anymore it's like literally just a towel
and I just lay it out and all my stuff
stays in the little pouch so wherever
you put your stuff that actual bag turns
into a pouch that's in the towel so I
know that when I go to the beach I get
all paranoid that my stuff is out and I
want to go in the water but this it has
like a little hidden compartment like
you really can't tell that this is a
little pocket and I just put all my
stuff in there and it's a towel I'm like
I absolutely think it's genius and when
I leave I just fold it back up into a
backpack and boom and lastly I wanted to
share with you guys another favorite of
mine this month have you guys follow me
on snapchat that you've been keeping up
with my new journey that I've been
taking on a dimension it in this video
just because I feel like it fits I just
started within the last month and I've
been absolutely loving it and it's
meals they basically are a company who
makes organic they're pretty much
they're almost 100% they're not but
they're close to organic meals that are
perfectly portioned and they're prepped
for you so Stephen and I were trying to
eat healthy and it's actually so
difficult to eat healthy consistently
for us not because we can't but because
we're both so busy by the time we get
home by the time we're like I don't know
I mean I know a lot of people out there
and I know a lot of moms who can do all
of this stuff because they're super
women and that's amazing I have not yet
got that skill to do it yet so really
being lazy to cook and prepping for
meals and making sure I always have
healthy food on hand is the main factor
of me not eating healthy I found out
about lean meals I've been doing it for
a month and basically every three days
you get a delivery or door and like this
large refrigerator bag and you get all
of your meals for the next three days
including snacks and it has been a life
changer for Steven and I because we do
it together and now we're both eating so
much healthier we have been feeling
better about ourselves more energy and
we've also been exercising so we've been
exercising together nothing fancy just
like we've been doing exercises from
like YouTube videos and I've noticed a
huge difference in my body I'm not
trying to lose weight I just really
wanted to say that I don't want to lose
weight I'm not trying to be skinnier
because I understand that I'm skinny I
want to actually be more toned maybe
have a bigger butt like do a little bit
more squats you know like I want more
toned and when I say toned I mean toe
you know I just want to feel better
about myself well it actually kind of
bothers me that when I am telling people
that I want to be healthy and I want to
eat better and I want to exercise a lot
of people are like why would you do that
you're already so skinny you don't need
to lose weight and that's like the
really really messed up mindset of
people because actually everyone should
eat healthy and everyone should exercise
because it's not about being skinny it's
about health and it's about being
feeling better about yourself and your
energy level and the longevity of your
life
actually it's not about being skinny
it's not about the outside and
definitely it helps to know that you are
in great shape and for those of you who
do want to lose weight I'm telling you
this or you don't even have to do like
lean meals in general but just eating
healthy without exercise will
dramatically change your body and you'll
notice it very quickly it's like this
huge i opening thing for me and i post a
lot about it on snapchat because i want
to motivate other people to also be
healthy and when I see other people
sending me their snapchats now of them
eating healthy it actually makes me
super happy because it keep continues to
motivate me to do so I know Katie
started eating healthy too and I'm
really proud of her because she loves
pizza you guys know this and she has not
been eating pizza and she's been eating
healthy and I told her like we should
all take a vacation at the end of the
summer we can all be great shape and
super fit and just you know like
everyone wants to be and I understand
that I'm not in bad shape I totally get
that but I want to be just healthy and
have a big butt
I mean alright guys so that's it for my
favorites this month I really hope that
you guys enjoyed this video give it a
thumbs up if you did leave any of your
favorites in the comments down below
love to see the products that you guys
have been loving beauty or unrelated to
beauty Fitness any like cool workout
videos that you guys know of online
because I'm always looking for new
workouts I've kind of been doing the
same one and it's like it reminds me of
like a health book in like eighth grade
you know I'm talking about it's a really
really old fashion but it works so I've
been using that it's eight-minute it was
an eight-minute abs or nine minute I
don't know it's something like that but
it works really well so that's about it
I will see you guys in my next video bye
okay when I take a selfie with the
snapchat camera I'm like feeling myself
I'm like yeah when I take a picture with
the iPhone I'm like
little snatch in action why Jesus oh I
