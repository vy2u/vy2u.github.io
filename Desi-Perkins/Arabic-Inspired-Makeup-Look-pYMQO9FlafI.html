today we're gonna do this arabic
inspired i so prior to recording i
applied my Paula's Choice and mattifying
absolutely just to make my face super
matte and it's also gonna serve as our
moisturizer then I'm going to apply Mac
soft ochre all over my lid for a base
I'm taking white and cream from the
lorac Pro palette and I'm gonna apply
that to the brow bone with a Mac 239
brush then i'm taking taupe from the
same palette and i'm just gonna apply
that in the crease with a mac 217 and
this is gonna be our first transition
shade for this look next I'm gonna use
espresso and this is a really deep rich
brown I'm gonna use the same exact brush
and I'm gonna place this right below the
first transition shade just so we have a
really nice gradient you really want to
take your time with this step in
particular because with this shade we're
mapping out exactly the shape that we
want to create and after this we're
gonna go in with black so you don't
really want to mess up with black
because that's really hard to blend out
so I'm gonna go in with the Urban Decay
blackout from The Naked 2 palette this
is one of my favorite black eyeshadows
because it's super black to apply the
black eyeshadow I'm actually gonna use a
zoeva smokey shader brush and this brush
is really good for beginners doing cut
creases because it just makes it a
little bit easier and a little bit more
precise than using a blending brush and
then to the absolute outer edge of my
cut crease I'm using a tiny little lip
brush with black eyeshadow and I'm just
gonna sharpen that edge just a bit then
I'm picking up a taupe again and my Mac
217 brush and I'm just gonna really make
sure everything's nice and blended
next I'm gonna pick up this pigment from
sugarpill and it's called Goldilocks it
is an absolutely phenomenal and gorgeous
beautiful amazing pigment
I love this color I'm just gonna pack
that on it to the lid once I place the
pigment down I decided I wanted to bring
in a little bit more red into this look
so I went into the honest Ostia lavish
palette and picked up Siena and I just
buff that in my upper crease area now
it's time for liner I'm gonna go in with
my makeup geek gel liner and apply that
to the lid and make a nice little wing
there time for primer I'm going to use
my doctor bandit pore no more just to
create a nice even base for my
foundation and also minimize my pores
and I did that because now I'm going to
apply my concealer real quick before I
finish the eye look so I'm kind of all
over the place right now but I'm an
artist okay let me be then I just
applied black eyeliner and blended that
out along the lash line and a further
smoked that out I'm going to use Sienna
again and just a fluffy brush time for a
little gold glitter I'm using my NYX
gold liner and I'm going to apply that
on the bottom of the black liner time
for mascara and I'm going to use the
Urban Decay perversion cuz this super
black and that's actually a really good
buildable mascara but I'm not going to
do that because I'm using false lashes
top and bottom I don't remember what the
top ones were because they didn't have a
name but the bottom ones are House of
lashes precious before I apply my
foundation you guys know I love to use a
lip balm just to prep my lips make them
nice and smooth this is my beyond
natural lip balm taking my hello
flawless foundation and buffing that all
over my skin with a sigma kabuki brush
and I'm in the shade beige now I'm
setting my concealer with be a shade
banana from the Anasazi a contour kit
I'm going back into that kit and I'm
just gonna apply the contour sheets it
to my face just to warm everything up
god it's time for some blush I'm going
to use this Coastal Scents Forever blush
in the shade brush this has a really
beautiful finish and it's a perfect
peach shade which you guys know I love
now I'm gonna take the mary lou manizer
highlight from the balm which you guys
recommended to me and I love it and I'm
just gonna put the highlighter on the
high points of my face
taking a stripped down lip liner by Mac
and lining my lips and then I'm going to
apply this a dose of colors lipstick in
the shade
and to add a little bit of gloss to this
look I'm taking my Gerard cosmetics lip
gloss in the shade and nude and applying
that over top that is the last step of
the look I hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial and don't forget to come back
