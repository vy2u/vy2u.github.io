hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today's Halloween tutorial is gonna be
me recreating this artwork I found
online of beetlejuice but this is car
juice I thought this was so dope and a
really cool take on Beetlejuice I love
this drawing I love this look I'm
obsessed with how this turned out I
think it looks super cool this tutorial
is really fun and what I love the most
about it is that it's really hard to
make mistakes it's almost like a
beautiful mess so you don't have to do
the exact same strokes the Messier the
better and I'm gonna be voicing over
this tutorial because I had to really
get in the zone let's go ahead and get
into the tutorial the first thing I'm
gonna do is apply the news your way
foundation all over my face neck and
chest because we want to start off with
a lighter canvas like the painting and I
like this because it's gonna last a
little bit longer than a face paint and
it also gives me full coverage I mean
this foundation covered everything so I
really liked that and I just applied it
all with my Beauty Blender alright next
we're gonna go into the makeup forever
flash palette and I'm gonna use this to
start adding all of the color into the
look I started with this random color
above my eyebrow but decided to move on
to the light green shades first cuz I
felt like those were the easiest to
start off with that gave me you know a
better guide so I'm going in with this
light green shade first and I'm applying
it around the forehead the ears a little
bit around my mouth and jaw area as well
my favorite part about this look is that
it's okay if you do messy lines messy
paint strokes the Messier the better
really you don't want it to look too
perfect I mixed up a little bit of a
dark green shade and I'm just gonna
apply that around the edges where I
applied the lime green and I'm kind of
just going off the reference picture at
this point and trying to get as close to
the photo as possible
it's a lot easier when you have your
reference picture right next to you
alright we're gonna go into this light
purple shade and again I'm just blending
these colors together from the flash
palette and I want to start off with the
lighter shades and then build on those
right so this is kind of the first color
I'm laying down on my cheekbone and I'm
gonna contour the tip of my nose give
myself similar
nostrils nostrils as the drawing shadow
the lower lip and the corner of my lip
as well kind of extending that out and
just mixing a slightly darker purple and
then applying that right in the hollow
as well and see I'm making a sharp line
I'm not trying to blend it out next I'm
taking a little bit of black and
applying that in the ears you don't want
to forget your ears especially if your
hair is gonna be showing you want to
cover everything that's showing if you
want this to look like a realistic
painting I mix some of that black with
the purple and now I'm adding that again
in the hollows of my cheek bones and as
you guys can see right now everything
looks like a hot-ass mess it will look
like a mess before it looks cool I
promise you so don't get discouraged if
you look at your face and you're like
what is happening this looks crazy it
kind of goes against everything that we
have been taught which is blend blend
blend and like your eyebrows have to be
perfect like this is the opposite of all
of that
now I'm taking some black and adding a
sharp edge to the jaw line like a
drawing would have and also the sharp
edges to the nose around the nose I also
make sure to later fill in the nostril
area too so it looks more like a drawing
back into that green I guess I'm all
over the place here cuz it's you know I
was in the zone so I'm just adding a
little bit more green to my face cuz I
felt like it needed to be tied down in
the lower part of my face since I had so
much green around the forehead here's
where things get crazy okay I'm telling
you this goes against everything for me
which is make your brows messy I started
off with a brown base and then I go into
my tattoo liner by Kat Von D and I'm
just gonna make crazy ass strokes you
don't want it to be perfect the whole
point of it is to look messy I ended up
going in with my NYC liquid liner after
because I needed it to be a little bit
darker and I think the Kat Von D mix
with the face paint was kind of making
it a little too light so that liquid
liner worked a lot better
so next we just want to take a black
base I'm just continuing to use the
flash palette since that's what I have
and I'm gonna apply that all over my lid
and then I'm gonna apply it on the sides
of my lid so in the inner brow bone and
the outer V of the eye and also the
lower lash line I'm taking the Kat Von D
concealer in white and using that to
create the highlights in the center of
the eyes and I'm following the painting
as well so everything looks kind of
crazy right now but it comes together in
the end I realized earlier I forgot to
outline my Cupid's bow with the black
when I was doing all the black lines so
I just go back in and do that real quick
now taking the purple shades I'm gonna
go ahead and apply that in the hollows
of the eyes and hug the edges of the
black around the eyes as well with this
purple shade I also decided to bring
that down the neck to mimic natural
shadows under the chin so I'm going back
in with the white concealer and I'm
gonna apply a few more highlights around
the face and I want to blend them out
but still make it an obvious highlight
I'm also going to apply that on the
under eye here to kind of mirror the
highlight we have on the lid I ended up
putting that white also on the tip of my
nose and down the bridge of my nose next
for the lips we want to make them look
big and luscious so I'm stippling a
purpley red paint around the edges kind
of like an over lining technique but I'm
not doing a line I'm just stippling and
then I'm gonna go into a darker mixture
of that color like I said I'm just
mixing Purple's Reds and then adding
black anytime I want to make a color
deeper so I'm just gonna start messily
doing little paint strokes around the
corners of the lips and to make the lips
look fuller and have that Angelina Jolie
pouch I draw Y so a line down the center
of the bottom and then the top of the Y
on the upper lip and that's gonna give
us the pouch and then to make it look
even bigger add the white to the center
and blend that out a little bit that's
going to be the highlights in the lips
we really want to intensify the black
around the eyes so I'm taking this black
shadow bite etosha de Nona it's in the
shade blackest black and I'm gonna pack
that on on the inner and outer corner
outer inner and outer corner of the eye
socket next I decided to take a little
bit of the white paint and apply some
highlights around the face just randomly
where I feel like I wanted there to be a
little bit of a pop and as you guys can
see I stipple it on with a stippling
brush and then kind of Pat in with my
finger and with the more bold highlights
I use a flat concealer brush because I
don't want to blend these out as much I
want them to be more like a full-on
bold paint stroke I'm gonna go ahead and
do that down the neck as well and at
this point when I feel like I have a
vibe of the overall look I just start to
go in with random colors wherever I kind
of feel it you know you just have to
feel it
and if you can't feel it then just
really mimic the painting but for the
most part I just go back in and think
okay where could I use a little bit more
for example up here I felt like the
green wasn't enough so let me just pop
back over here add some more green
really pushing it into the hairline so
that it flows seamlessly once I put the
wig on which by the way that was really
hard to get out of my hair but it's all
good do it for the video
I used my arm as my palette here so I
mixed a darker gray purple color because
I decided we're gonna have to intensify
these cheekbones and for this I wanted
to do more of a harsh line here and then
I'm just really kind of like you would a
skeleton just really suck in your cheeks
and follow those cheekbones and take it
down the side of your mouth as well and
as you'll see later I take it a little
bit further down than that even so I'm
just going back in adding a little bit
of this dark burgundy color and just
applying some shadows under the jaw
because you would have natural shadows
there and I'm also gonna do a few
scribbles down the neck as well super
messy just so I look
even more like a drawing and then to
continue the whole drawing vibe down the
neck you want to take the black liner
and also make some sketch marks as well
if your collar and neck aren't gonna be
showing it won't be that big of a deal
but if you want to keep it real you got
to do every part of the skin that's
showing so that's why I'm doing
everything and here I messed up a little
bit but guess what it's not a big deal
cuz nothing has to be perfect see that
dot I was like oh no let me wipe it away
oh that actually looks really good there
now I'm taking this red liner this is an
urban decay liner I believe the shade
name is Roach but if not I will have it
in the description that's just gonna
give us those bloodshot eyes that were
going for and of course for the final
touches we're gonna turn these eyes blue
and we're gonna pop on a wig because we
got to get that Beetlejuice effect I
love this wig this was custom color for
me by Pravana and I just added the green
bits with some green eyeshadow alright
so this is the finished makeup look I
really hope that you guys enjoyed the
tutorial let me know what you thought
about it in the comments down below and
I'll see you guys in my next video bye
I'm the ghost with the most babe I don't
know I can't ever compose hold on look
