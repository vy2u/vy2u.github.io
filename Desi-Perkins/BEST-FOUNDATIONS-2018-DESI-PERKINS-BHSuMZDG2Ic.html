desi Perkins for those of you who are
new subscribers here today's video is
going to be all about my current go-to
foundations
it's been a year since I've done my
current favorite foundation video in the
past and of course foundations for me
aren't really something that changed too
often so I still love all the
foundations from my last video however
these are like the new have on my makeup
counter everyday foundations that I've
been loving I have some drugstore
foundations here and some high-end
foundations so let's go ahead and get
right into it so my first favorite
foundation is the NARS natural radiant
foundation this one look at it it's it's
getting down to the nitty gritty over
here okay I have been using this one
probably the most out of all the
foundations what I love about this
foundation is it just has a really
really nice full coverage without
looking cakey that is really the number
one thing that I love about this
foundation the other thing I love is the
color is really good for me I'm in the
shade Barcelona and sometimes when I'm a
little bit more tan I mix in a little
bit of Syracuse so they look really
busted because I use them all the time
but mostly Barcelona right now is my
go-to that's why it's looking hella
empty okay there isn't really any cons
to this foundation for me there's maybe
like the slightest con and that's that I
wish it would just like set itself a
little bit more but you can set it with
powders to make sure that it stays nice
and put but other than that I mean I
love the foundation I love that it's a
pump it looks crazy I'm embarrassed to
be showing it but this is amazing next
for my favorite foundations this one has
kind of been with me forever if you've
been watching my channel for the longest
time I remember I would wear this every
single event I went to ever makeup event
and people would ask what foundation was
and every time I would tell them they'd
feel surprised especially any celebrity
makeup artist that would ask me what
foundation I'm like currently loving it
was always the matte and poreless by
Maybelline this is the fit me foundation
mmm I love this foundation I got to the
point like I said in a video before
where I wore its own
chimes on my YouTube channel that I
stopped doing tutorials with it because
I felt like I needed to change it up to
show you guys a little bit more
diversity really this was like my
tried-and-true go-to and I still have it
on my vanity right now for me even
though it's matte and poreless it's not
super matte
I wouldn't say kinda like it gives the
perfect amount of matte coverage that
looks healthy not tight
you know there's certain matte
foundations that are so matte which I
actually have one of those that like
Titan you up you understand and that is
good for certain things so it's not that
I don't love that this one because it's
not that tight it makes it so that it's
something I could wear every single day
and I could wear to any event and it's
not a specific foundation for a specific
thing it's really just like this is
always like a go-to for me 228 it's
always been my color I have so many of
these if you're looking for a good
drugstore foundation it's great and I
feel like it would be good for all skin
types to the next foundation is fairly
new for me but the moment I wore it
I've just been wearing it non-stop and
that is the Lancome ultra wear
foundation it's up to 24 hour color wear
and comfort transfer resistant that is
very very true transfer resistant that's
what I love about it and it does has SPF
15 I've worn this and I've done flash
photography I don't find like I have a
lot of flash back or any at all I
haven't seen so this is the shade for
10w bis W it says on the back course
Lancome I love that they have a pump
that's always really really great for me
I feel like it has really really good
coverage it's the foundation I'm wearing
right now I had a really really red
breakout here and I feel like it covered
it and put concealer on that so it does
cover really well I love the color of
this foundation too there's certain
foundations that didn't make the list
because even though I love the
consistency the formula the colors are
slightly off but this one is really
really good for me but I also really
love about this foundation is that for a
more daytime less makeup look I can
still wear this if I buff a light layer
or I can build it to like full face like
I have right now I also find that it
mixes really well with my Mac strobe
cream I mix half in half of this and
this when I want just a luminous no
makeup type of look
I still want to have a little coverage
so that's kind of my cocktail and these
work really really well together so it's
nice that I can wear this daytime
everyday or full coverage beat glam like
these we're going on to the next
foundation okay alright so the next
foundation is another oldie but goodie
okay and it's also another drugstore
foundation this is the l'oreal
infallible Pro matte foundation this one
is basically it's empty now I think I
got to get a new one but I'm in the
shade 107 and like I was saying earlier
with the matte poreless that that's not
super super matte this is super super
matte okay like you don't want any oil
seeping through super super matte I have
worn this all over my face and I will
wear it all over my face again normally
what I love to do with this foundation
is say I want my whole face to look
really luminous but my oily ass nose
wants to play me all the time so I use
this to combat the oils on my nose say
for example I want more of a luminous
all-over glow so I want to use a
foundation like the NARS radiant I'll
put this all over and then this I will
take my Beauty Blender and I apply it
all in this area right here and it stays
matte it doesn't get oily I swear this
stuff is like a barricade and I love it
for that and that's what I use this
foundation for normally I don't really
use it all over my face but if I think
I'm gonna be real sweaty somewhere I
don't know then I would or if you have
really oily skin like it just really
works for me the only thing I will say
is that sometimes if you do apply this
make sure that you're like make it moves
try not to put a lot of concealer on top
of it it lifts a little bit but if you
apply it right you don't overly pounce
it after it's already set it's gonna
look fabulous next foundation even
though it's not something I wear all
over my face it's still one of my
favorites right now and I love
everything about it
it's the Lancome ultra wear makeup stick
this is also an SPF 21
and I'm telling you I freaking love this
foundation stick Lancome actually sent
this to me as and they market it as like
a nice contour you could use it to
contour so that's what I used it for but
now I kind of want to pick it up in my
shade to actually wear it all over my
face because I love the consistency
this I love the way it wears it never
fades throughout the day if I put the
cream contour there I feel like it stays
put and this color in particular which
is 435 bisque W is so good and W stands
for a warm so that's why I like to use
this as my bronzy all over and I apply
it all around the forehead put it all
over here the jawline just blend it all
out and I look sunny and bronzed and I
love that blends easily sometimes cream
contours can be a little intimidating
for some even for me honestly I don't
really love cream contouring all the
time this one it just blends like boom
easy and it has a soft matte finish so
if you're into foundation sticks and
you're looking for something that's a
little bit matte this would be really
really good for you I'm curious to see
how this would work in the t-zone area
that's what I want to try neck I
actually went to Sephora with Katie the
other day and I told her you need to buy
this like immediately buy and she did
but it's that good and this is
definitely something that is you're
going on vacation you want cream you
don't want to look like you're wearing a
lot of makeup you just kind of want to
look bronzy maybe you put concealer on
and just blend it out with your fingers
even cuz you're that girl sometimes and
then you just look great you look sunny
ready to go all these foundations that I
just mentioned are my current table top
go twos you know when I say table top I
mean I have my makeup collection over
there and I have the stuff that I'm like
ride-or-die I need them hands reach
right here on my desk I do have a couple
other foundations that are here but it's
almost like they've been sitting there
and I notice that I don't use them as
much but I still love them they're just
not the ones that I'm grabbing at the
moment but I thought I would mention
them anyways
so the next foundation we have is the
Marc Jacobs shameless foundation this is
the shade Y 370 what I like the most
about this particular foundation is the
lightweight feel of it it doesn't feel
heavy on your face it doesn't feel like
you're wearing a lot of product it drys
itself down after you apply it I don't
feel like I need a powder after I feel
like it just kind of sets and doesn't
really get anywhere it just looks good
it feels light feels frothy for me this
is more of like a casual date
foundation because of the way it feels
once it dries it feels like you can just
touch it it's not gonna move without
powder and then when you move your face
it has like this nice glowy sheen very
unique and of course even though it has
SPF it hasn't given me any crazy
flashback at all so another good point
and then there are two foundations that
are kind of sitting on my makeup desk
but they haven't really been loved I'm
gonna mention them anyways but just know
that they're not my go-to s right now oh
they're not my writer guys they're kind
of like my side chick foundations at the
moment I feel bad I feel like I'm I feel
like I'm breaking up with somebody or
something that's what I feel like this
one Armani lemonis self let me tell you
like oh I still like I still love it
it's not you it's me it's like I have
love for you am I in love with you right
now no I'm not in love with you right
now I love you though I do love you I
will go back to you one day
maybe our Monty luminous silk has been
my go-to for many years and there's just
been new foundations that have hit the
market that I've kind of done better
things for me so I'm sorry people change
so it's not what I've been using lately
still love it just want to put it out
there because for so long that was like
my go-to and right now it's just kind of
like I'll call you after midnight see
what you're doing kind of thing you
understand another foundation that's
also on my desk that I don't grab this
is the G way essential high coverage
cream foundation this foundation is bomb
AF okay so good but I feel like I
haven't really found the right color for
me I don't know if it's because my mom
took some of them she kind of like came
up on these and she is wearing this
foundation non-stop she says that
everyone gives her compliments and I'm a
little upset she may have taken my color
I don't know but when I went to go look
for my color in the foundations I didn't
really like find one that worked that
well and I found one that worked okay
for me because I was really tan at the
time but now that I've lost all of the
color if you do have a shade in this
foundation like you're gonna love it
it's so good it's so good it's super
high coverage I mean probably more high
coverage than any of these foundations
that I've listed it's like it's gonna
cover everything and it has like a nice
matte but not a tight matte feel which
really really nice if you're going out
to an event and you want your makeup to
last you want to look full coverage you
don't want to be too oily too dewy this
foundation is just great all right so
that's it those are all my current
favorite foundations let me know if any
of the foundations I've mentioned are
ones that you've tried are liked or even
let me know if you've tried them and you
hated them and why so it's good to know
and get to talk about it in the comments
down below like I said because if you
have oily skin and somebody else has
only skin in the comments you can kind
of bounce off each other and what worked
for you what didn't also if you're
