so for today's video we're going to be
doing this deep dark blackest black
smoky eye I know smoky eye should be
very intimidating it even intimidates me
I've been doing makeup for a long time
there's some black smokey eye photos in
my house that I would wish to never see
again I think it could be difficult to
get the black to gradiate into the brow
bone without looking too overpowering or
too crazy right so I know we all can
struggle with that when we first start
doing a black smokey eye so I've picked
up a few tips and tricks along the way
that has made it so much easier for me
so I wanted to really go in depth as to
what you need to do to blend it it is a
lot of work but I feel like when you're
done it's definitely worth it so you
guys are interested in this black smoky
eye and then keep on watching
first thing we want to do is apply an
eyeshadow base this is the benefit Air
Patrol and I'm using my concealer buffer
brush 5 zoeva
gives me a nice even distribution all
over the lid you can see my lids are
like naturally pretty red so this
cancels everything out just so it gives
me a nice base I don't usually mine the
discoloration actually but when we're
doing a look where it's like very
precise blending you want to make sure
everything is nice and even before you
can see I'm making sure to buff it all
in especially towards the crease and
like out here just make sure you really
get even layer next also a very
important step when you're doing a lot
of blending is to set your eyeshadow
base and this is a BH cream and I'm
going to really pack this on starting up
under my brow that's where I like to put
most of the product because it gives you
a nice brow bone highlight and then
bring it all down just make sure to set
everything so we're going to make
everything nice and smooth - don't be
afraid to bring your eyeshadow out all
the way over here because we're going to
clean it up with a makeup wipe after and
you just want to make sure that you
blend everything out words so when you
do clean it up you have a nice sharp
line and everything with gradients out
all the way instead of stopping abruptly
next I'm going to pick up a transition
shade this is orange soda by a BH it's a
nice peachy tone I love this for the
transition shade another one similar is
peach smoothie for makeup geek Eminem
that with my two to eight crease brush
fries away that's a nice fluffy brush
it's healthy my head back and I'm going
to apply this eyeshadow into the crease
and then slightly above the crease using
a black smoky eye you really want to
have a transition shade because this is
going to be the first step to the
gradient of your eyeshadow look you need
a few shadows to grading it down before
you get to that really harsh black and
that's what makes it look a lot cleaner
smoother better okay if you get any
eyeshadow on your lid because that's
going to be laughed out anyway and
another trick I like to do is if for
some reason you feel like you're blend
went up a little too high right around
here go back into your brow bone
highlight you set your base with and
just kind of run it along the edges and
softly clean it up that happens to me
all the time and I just do that
so next I'm taking up rust and this is
from the melt cosmetics rough stacked
dwellest as you can see I'm going to
pick this up with a Smith to 3/5 brush
we're going to place this right below
the orange soda shade so that the orange
soda is just slightly peeking through
and this is when we're going to start
building the shape so I'm really trying
to pinpoint this into the crease we're
going to start deepening everything up I
love this Smith brush if you guys saw my
video on my favorite brushes because as
you guys can see it's creating pretty
nice line here into the crease almost
like it's cutting the crease but then
the bristles that are below the the
point here really help blend that out
can do like really good precision
blending work into the crease also what
I did when I did this makeup look was I
also mixed in a little bit of a BH
Sienna you guys haven't seen this
eyeshadow in a hot minute this one has a
slightly lighter color than the rest and
I just kind of went over the edges with
that when it gives it like a nice sunset
yz5 and then I'm taking the orange soda
shade one more time and I'm going to run
that along the edges of everything we
just put down just in case you covered
up too much of the orange soda or you
need a little bit of blending to happen
this is what I feel like really makes
the difference for me when I'm doing a
black smokey eye before when I did a
black smokey eye what I would do is I
would pack the black onto the lid at
this point and then buff that out but I
find that the black phase is the other
color
a lot better if you apply it in the
crease first blend it all out and then
tack it onto the lid you see what I'm
saying so I'm using the melt cosmetics
black eyeshadow this is called dark
matter super black love it some picking
that up on a smith 230 brush here same
thing we did with the other colors but
this time keep it as low as possible and
it's okay if you get it a little bit
onto you would start on the outside and
start blending it lay the brush this
outer part with the point going into the
crease and then I blend it the rule
because I don't want the black to go too
high that's the key right if I put the
black eyeshadow too far up in my crease
that's when it's going to start to look
like too crazy you know that's what's
scary if the black goes up too high and
don't pick up too much black eyeshadow
so I dipped my brush in and I'm going to
make sure that I blend all of this out
as much as I can before I apply more
black eyeshadow that's also key a lot of
rules and tricks to this to get it just
right but I look back at some of the
smoky eye as I've done and I was like
cool I was really into them when I was
19 I think black smokey eye when I'd go
to the Clin to like underaged clubs you
know a thought and bopping out there
wearing black smokey eyes on the regular
so it all looks kind of crazy right now
a little messy right because it's all
over our lids gonna look fabulous once
we're done so first go at it now I'm
going to go back in again deepening it
up don't worry too much about the
outside looking too perfect because
we're going to clean that up it's going
to be sharp by the time we're done
sometimes you got to go back in with a
little bit of the Sienna shade just kind
of go over the block line that we made
there's a lot of blending that goes into
this look it's totally worth it when
you're done now that place that just
going over with my transition shade
brush lightly grating now moving onto
the lid if you really want the black to
be just like really dark a lot of
eyeshadows when you pack on black don't
look as deep so what I like to do I mean
even though this one's really really
dark what I like to do is first apply a
dark eyeshadow base or in black gel
liner which is really really dark this
is probably the darkest
I have so I take that on a concealer
brush and we're just going to apply that
over the lid and this is what's going to
make it just deep and dark really work
it into your lashes too over here make
sure you apply most of it like towards
the lash base and then as you work up
going to have less product on your brush
which is what you want that way you
could just kind of lightly fade it into
the blending we already did don't want
to start with like the glob up here in
the crease because it'll be too heavy
and I like to keep less cream products
closer to my crease as well because if
you have hooded eyes or anything like
that like sometimes it could get a
little too slippery I don't find that
that happens with English eyeliner but
if I were to use like for example a NYX
jumbo eye shadow base that happens to me
where it creases up then we're going to
pack on that same black eyeshadow with a
little flat shader brush and tap off the
eye shadow distant nothing Falls doesn't
matter anyways because I like to do my
foundation afterwards so if you have
fallout not a big deal and then cover
that hold with space now it's cleanup
time so I'm taking a makeup wipe and
cleaning up all the black under our eyes
and I just really sharpen up the edge
here so now picking up a black pencil
liner this is scandal eyes Rimmel and
just want really uncomfortably twist
that up in your waterline since the
eyeshadow is so dark you can't have any
skin peeking through once you apply your
lashes so all going to get it all in
between those lashes so I'm going to go
ahead and apply some mascara this is the
Tarte light camera flashes don't really
need a lot to small coat here then we're
just going to go ahead and apply some
falsies and I have to use some semi
dramatic ones because the eyeshadow is
so dark but you can't really see the
lashes if I were to use for example like
onyx by house of lashes which is usually
my go-to these are camilla and these are
by flutter lashes so you guys can see
they're super thick I'm really fluttery
lashes are pretty all right here we go
Shane and see them can you see them and
we see my lashes you know know they're
there in spirit they're there I'm going
to go ahead and prime my face using this
Spock's primer waters and then I'm going
to use my Armani luminous silk
foundation and 7.5 with my Beauty
Blender now what I like to do is apply
the matte next to nothing face color and
this is in dark they call this kind of
like a sheer luminous balm so I take
about two pumps of that with my Beauty
Blender you can go over your whole face
with what I usually do but I start where
I want it to be the most dewy which is
over here in this area of the face and
it does have a little coverage when you
apply it on top of more heavy coverage
foundation but by itself didn't really
cover anything it's not supposed to do
that's not what it's meant to do I apply
a little bit of this all over my
foundation and I looked so luminous when
I took photos just in person - it looks
really nice I was impressed which I'm
happy because when I did it when I wore
it without anything else just the
regular balm I was like oh man thought I
was going to love this product the
colors are a little bit warm I'm kind of
in-between because of the undertones of
all the colors this is OK for me now
because I'm a little bit tan right now
but it still did make me pretty warm but
once I apply like my concealer and
everything you can't really tell I'm
gonna use a NARS creamy concealer and
biskits this is kind of like a color
correcting concealer right here so I'm
applying this first just a little bit or
a lot of it blend that in concealer just
makes this smoky eye look so much
cleaner why you want to do your smoky
eye first and then do everything else
because it can get super messy and if
you try to do it before your under eyes
may look really dark and then to
brighten all that up I'm going to go
over that with medium in Becca aqua
limit concealer and also use that to
really sharpen up that part of the look
I'm sorry if I seem a little out of it
like I swear every single time I work
out legs I just feel so unable to speak
so we're here might as well just kind of
sit at one time down the nose you know
what the hell should come on hit it over
here this is like a really extreme
makeup look so when you highlight and
everything it looks really nice and just
go ahead and blend that all out so when
you make this line up concealer make
sure you flip your be blowing around and
let that line out after the eye shadow
so you don't have like this white line
across
simple so now I'm gonna go ahead and set
my concealer using the RCM a powder and
this is the morphe 27 brush I'm just
going to set this under eye part and
then right around my nose area on the
apples of my cheeks I'm going to go
ahead and finish the eyes because they
look super top-heavy right now and I
want to give you guys to finish the look
of the eyes we're going to take this
dose of colors pencil brush and I'm
going to go into Sienna which is that
reddish shade and I'm going to start
smoking out the lower lash line starting
with most of the product on the outer
part connecting it to the black up here
and then smoking inwards bringing up
pretty low because once we put the black
liner on the lower lash line everything
kind of disappears a little bit so apply
it and then blend it all out with a semi
clean blending brush whatever you use
for your transition shade you could use
to blend out this lower lash part and
apply a little bit more on the outer
part of the eye here is where the black
will go down the lowest next we're going
to take the black liner that we used in
our waterline and we're going to apply
that in the waterline on our lower lash
line and also smoke it out pretty heavy
on the outer part it's really going to
connect to the top and the bottom so I'm
just building it up on this outer part
first and then as I go to the inner
corner of the eye I kind of make sure it
only goes in the waterline over here if
I make it too thick all the way in it
may close off my eyes a little too much
and then this gives it more of like a
caddy look then I take this tiny little
morphe e36 brush with a little bit of
black eyeshadow and I'm going to smoke
that out and just kind of set it so I
barely dipped my brush into the
eyeshadow I just tiny tiny bit just
enough so I could smoke everything out
so now we have the black under the eye
really balances out at the top of our
eyes so we don't love like super crazy
if you need to go back in with a little
bit of Sienna
to just clean up those edges you can and
go ahead and pick up my bronzer this is
the hoola by benefit this is the
japonesque brush no lightly bronze the
cheekbones and the forehead for me with
a smoky I like to do more of just
bronzer no blusher leaks I feel like the
eyes already so extreme I mean at least
for me and what I got going on that I
like to just apply bronzer also going to
take a little bit of that whoo LeBron
on a flat brush and contour the tip of
the nose here and down I'm going to go
in with this little foundation brush
trying to lightly tap over the contour
so it doesn't look harsh I'm going to
set my face with the smashbox photo
primary waters and i like to do that
before i apply a little bit of highlight
because it makes my highlight pop a
little bit more I'm so sore right now
that when I move backwards my my whole
stomach is just like and for the
highlight I'm going to be using gilded
honey by Laura Geller on the morphe
brush just kind of gives a look to the
side and apply that on the top of the
cheekbone to keep its bow a little bit
on the chin a little bit on the tip of
the nose and up here on the bridge you
can apply blush if you want to I don't
want to so I'm not doing two and I think
that's it besides lips let me figure out
what lip color I'm going to do so I
don't really want too much of a like lip
color I'm just going to take oak by Mac
and just lightly run that over the lips
kind of all over you guys notice I just
like have a beauty mark Alison just did
it real quick kind of like a wash in
this color over the lips alright so
that's it for this dramatic smoky eye so
I hope you guys picked up a few tips and
tricks on how to get the black to
gradient a little bit easier with the
rest of the colors up into the brow bone
I know putting the black in the crease
really helped me when I first picked up
that chip I hope you guys enjoyed thank
you guys so much for watching and I'll
see you next video
mm-hmm sometimes you have to appreciate
the blood</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
