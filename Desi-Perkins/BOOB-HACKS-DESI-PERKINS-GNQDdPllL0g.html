today's video is going to be all about
lips basically going to be all of my
boob hacks all the tips and tricks I
have to share with you guys I know it's
a bit personal but it's also something
that a lot of people want to know about
and have to deal with so it's just kind
of a natural thing without further ado
let's move on to the embarrassment so as
you guys can see I have a little
something I'm wearing a regular t-shirt
bra from Victoria's Secret right now my
boobs are fairly small but with some
tips and tricks you can get them looking
from this to this and hopefully there's
no guys watching this commenting wow
girls are deceiving because you don't
have to walk around with your shoving
for the public okay so just let us live
okay so there are a lot of things that
we can do to help support the ladies
first things first make sure you have a
good bra for example if you're wearing a
t-shirt course you want to wear a
t-shirt Rob you're just gonna look the
best it's gonna look smooth you're not
going to have you know when it looks
like just you have an empty gap here
between the bra and the boob you don't
want that look so make sure you pick up
a t-shirt bra when you're wearing
t-shirts but when you're not and you're
wearing a more low-cut shirt pick up a
bra that also has a more low-cut type of
top this is actually from Victoria's
Secret and it's from the pink collection
I really like the pink collection bras
because these are their underwire ones
they're really Lacy and sexy and they
give push-up but they're not their most
padded bras if you're looking for more
oomph and you want more padding they do
have like the level 5 bra but I have a
way to make these a little bit more
padding while still having this nice
lacy sexy bra and I'll show you guys
that later moving on to the next thing
that I like to use hold on please
chicken cutlet
gotcha you weren't expecting that were
you
I know we all have to get real
comfortable here these are what I like
to call chicken cutlets because they
legit look like little chicken cutlets
I'm always running around the house like
where's my chicken cutlet what I like to
do with these is say for example you
need a little push up in the beginning
clip when I did the before and after all
I did was add a better bra I started
with the t-shirt bra and then I added
the Victoria's Secret bra and in the
Victoria's Secret bra you want to place
this basically pushing the boob up it's
in there now it's gonna add all the
volume back to the top because you know
as we get older or as you have children
you start to lose volume here it's just
gonna be like a little best friend to
your boob if it works so great with any
push-up bra or any bra you want to add
these in boom and if you find that
you're out with a guy one thing leads to
another you just got to do the quick
like you feel me I mean it happens you
know I'm married now so my husband knows
about all these things he actually helps
me find my chicken cutlets that's what
it's come to these days I'm getting
really uncomfortable but my little
brother is behind the camera making sure
I'm in focus this is great this is
really great for me one of the moments
in my life that I'm most proud of so
these are non sticky you can get them
Victoria's Secret I believe has them
just order them online that's what I do
chicken cutlets you could even use them
for swimsuits you can get them wet I've
done that before if you really need to
feel like a photo shoot or something
like that obviously you don't want to
have these when you're doing like water
sports these are so good life savers
okay so now we're going to move on to a
different type of chicken cutlet I was
recently introduced to these chicken
cutlets on a photo shoot and they
changed my life these are sticky so
they're adhesive and you reuse them I've
worn them a bunch of different times
they come like this and they also have a
clasp in the middle if you want to clasp
them I never clasp them it works similar
to duct tape you could start it off here
at the bottom and lift your boob and
stick it like that obviously it's not
going to stick to my shirt but that's
what you want to do you want to just
pull it from under your boob and lift
your boob if you need the lift and stick
it to the side and this
is gonna be a really good solution for
anyone whose boobs are just like kind of
need a little umph for those dresses
that you can't wear a bra with they have
the low-cut here
certain tops will allow you to wear this
certain tops won't you know if the
material is too thin sometimes it looks
a little weird but if the material is
tight and thick or just tight in general
it's nice because it holds them in place
all night and it gives you a little bit
of lift and it also gives a nice round
shape these I can tell you have saved my
life before these I was just using duct
tape all the time and duct tape is great
I know Kim Kardashian uses duct tape as
well to like hold her boobs up in
dresses and it's still a really great
hack these are just so much more
convenient they don't hurt they're meant
for your boobs these are great of course
everything will be linked down below the
next hack is duct tape duct tape comes
with several warnings I can definitely
tell you guys it's not the safest thing
definitely uncomfortable to take off you
have to have strategy for this and I'm
putting it out there because I don't
want you guys to try it and then like
things happen to you but I'm just saying
it because I know I said it a lot on
snap I would use duct tape and I still
do sometimes when dresses don't allow me
to use those chicken cutlets but you
have to be so careful with the way you
remove the duct tape I know use a
cleansing oil or coconut oil or baby oil
at the end of the night and drench the
tape and then it'll slide off instead of
trying to pull it off because you can
pull your skin I have done it before up
here I put it like way too close to my
decollete and it was just awful
so that's my warning to you guys I've
done that before I learned my lesson I
will give you guys a reference photo
here that Kim Kardashian posted this is
the way that you want to duct tape them
in order to lift separate and give
yourself the most month if I was doing
this on myself what I like to do is
start from the bottom and then lift the
boob like that and tape it where you see
that it's lifted you want to add tape to
the side to add a little bit of volume
there as well that's pretty much all I
do it's super easy
everyone's boob shape is different
obviously and everyone has different
concerns with their boobs so you kind of
have to work with what you have and
figure it out yourself because what may
work really well for someone else my
or for your shapes you kind of have to
like figure out what's gonna work for
you so if you're not comfortable with
Jeff shape I have another alternative
for you and I've also used these a lot
this is free bra yes I really love the
patch this is basically the same concept
as duct tape you use them to lift your
boobs and hold them up when you're
wearing certain gowns or low-cut shirts
anything like that what I like to do
especially because I like to wear a lot
of those loca v-necks
is I actually cut these in half and I
only use the outer part to lift and hold
them up that way I don't have any tape
in this area and that works really well
for me these are kind of hard to find
unless you order them online I will link
them down below a tip with duct tape or
any type of like adhesives if you apply
a piece of duct tape and you realize
that when you messed up use another
piece of duct tape because it won't
stick anymore as well as it would the
first time and you don't want your duct
tape falling off halfway through the
night I've made that mistake as well
okay so these aren't necessarily things
that I use because personally I need
lift and these don't lift if you already
have perky boobs and you just need
nipple covers these ones are reusable
gel pads and these are from Windsor I've
actually seen somebody on their
Instagram wearing these under the
diamond bra which I thought was really
really sexy because these are skin tone
gel pads and she wore the diamond bar on
top and it literally just looked like
skin really good I'll insert a photo
over here but yeah so these are great
for that lastly I have to talk about
these and these you can buy at Target
these work so well to add a little bit
more support lift and also they help
with Razorback t-shirts so don't feel
like you need to go out and buy a
Razorback bra for all your Razorback
t-shirts because you can just buy this
at Target and I think these were super
cheap and they come with a bunch of them
nude black and white for example in the
beginning and after I put one of these
on and it helped strap my bra back and
pulled it a little bit tighter they're
not uncomfortable you don't feel them
actually gives you more lift more
support from your bra and it kind of
just pushes the volume up here a little
bit more so these are actually great I
feel like I don't have to buy all
different types of bra
for all different types of shirts
because these will hook you up alright
guys so that is it for my boob hacks I
hope you guys enjoyed this video my
embarrassment I hope you guys learned
something new if I could just help one
