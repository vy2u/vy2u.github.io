today's video is going to be a bridal
tutorial I cannot believe I've never
done a bridal tutorial on my channel yet
I did someone in the past but it was a
train wreck so I never uploaded it I
know there's so many different types of
bridal makeup and different styles that
you're going for for this video I
decided to go for a really beautiful
pretty radiant
timeless just soft just I should have
stopped at radiant I think that was like
end of sentence but I just kept it going
and then I ran out of adjectives so
that's where I'm at right now but I
think you guys get the point I just
wanted it to be timeless so let's just
go ahead and get started with the
tutorial first thing for a bridal look
or for any special occasion look is to
prime your skin now for your wedding day
or special occasion you want to make
sure you prime your skin to what your
skin type is so if you have really oily
skin you want to use a mattifying primer
if you have larger pores you want to use
something that will fill the larger
pores and if you have dry skin you want
to use a hydrating primers try to find a
primer that works for you for me I have
combination skin so I like to really
hydrate everything I'm using the Make Up
For Ever hydrating primer all over I'm
also going to mix another primer
afterwards which I will show you guys
taking a small amount and I'm going to
sort of work that into the skin
especially under the eyes because my
under eyes are really dry obviously I've
already moisturize my skin apply to eye
cream and all that stuff make sure you
give your moisturizer time to soak into
the skin before you apply primer or
makeup after that I'm going to use the
clean slate
timeless smoothing base primer this is
by Tarte cosmetics and this one is so
good for filling in large pores any fine
lines or anything like that you just
have to take a small amount and really
work it into your fingers and warm up
the product first because it is a little
bit of a sticker product and then
I like to push it into the apples of my
cheeks I also take whatever leftover and
kind of Pat back onto any fine lines and
my undereyes because it really is fills
them in and I'm not really rubbing with
this and pushing it into these suppose
we're going to move on to the eyes in my
opinion I like to do the safe makeup
laughs if you're sitting there getting
your makeup done and all of your face
makeup is done and someone's working on
your eye makeup it almost seems like
you're using that where time with your
foundation to finish getting ready
whereas if you do your foundation last I
feel like it lasts longer you don't get
any handprints if you're resting on your
face and everything just stays really
flawless and also if you have fallout
it's not going to fall onto your
foundation because you're not going to
have any yet you can really clean
everything off if you need to so my
recommendation is to do your foundation
last let's zoom in on the eyeball not
all the way just you know let's zoom in
a little
that's scary I look like housewives I
wore my hair in old Hollywood curls I
really like that classic look for my
wedding but I had longer hair with
shorter hair it gives me a little bit of
a news anchor vibe Donna back to you
we're going to go ahead and prime the
lid I'm going to go with the Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot I find that this one
really helps all the eyeshadow colors
stand out it does have a more opaque
undertone if you don't like that look
then I would go with something a little
bit more clear the air control has a
little bit of a tint this is by benefit
but it's not as thick as a soft ochre
but if I was getting married again which
you know if I'm not I mean that came out
wrong
I'm not going to be getting married
again really digging myself and all here
I would still use it as a primer for my
wedding day so I'm taking the soft ochre
on a flat concealer brush and I'm going
to clean up the brow area here lightly
it's going to give us a nice little
highlight and then we're going to drive
that down into the crease and lid
personally I like Mac soft ochre for
looks like this only because I have a
lot of redness
on my list phase and this really helps
cancel it all out so that whatever
colors I put on top of it stay true to
their actual color my eyes tend to pick
up a lot of warm tones because they are
so red underneath so even if I put a
cool tone brown it just to look red then
I'm taking a nice little buffing brush
and smoothing out all of the primer that
we applied you really want to work this
into the lid you don't want to have
fixed chunky primer and make sure it's
nice smooth and even I'll be using this
little Dior College has some nice blush
and neutral tones so I feel like that's
the most flattering and I'm going to
take this bone color right over here
we're going to pack that on to the brow
bone will give us a nice highlight and
alternate it to this brow bone color you
could use any eye shadow like long type
from mac cosmetics pretty similar and
next I'm going to take a light brown eye
shadow this one right here it's very
very soft I'm using a Smith 230 brush
we're going to start putting this into a
decrease very softly circular motions
windshield wiper really giving yourself
a shape this is going to help keep the
eyeshadow look really soft and diffused
and blended so any light brown eyeshadow
to lay down first it's gonna just make
your look look that much better I
actually did not do my own wedding
makeup which is funny cuz I was going to
up until like two weeks before my
wedding one of my friends knew somebody
who could do makeup and was good and I
liked it and I've actually felt good
about it because at the time there was
just so much going on and I like you
know and I didn't have to do anything
somebody was going to do my hair
somebody was going to do a makeup and I
just got to sit there and enjoy and
looks crazy as I wasn't super picky on
my wedding day I was so relaxed and just
cool about everything
I think everyone thought I was going to
be a bridezilla just practice all I
surprised everyone I showed up to my
venue my flowers were supposed to be all
white and I showed up and they were pink
and purple I kind of hate pink and
purple actually I put it freaked out but
instead I just chose it's lots of
champagne and moved on with my life
you just can't get upset at things on
your wedding day because things are
bound to go wrong
totally normal just go with the flow
next I'm going to take a dark brown
shade this one right here this is a
Smith q35 brush to focus this on the
outer part of the eye here actually I'm
going to switch to the 230 because it's
a little smaller and start working that
over here into the outer part of the eye
once you pack that on to the outer
corner you can somewhat slide it into
the crease a little bit I like to keep
with these circular motions make sure
it's nice and diffused taking my cleaner
brush and I'm going to blend out those
edges a little bit
if you're into more plumbing your purple
tones for your Bridal makeup you can
always just switch the colors out to
something that has a little more of
those tones for the lid I'm going to use
a blush tone this one right here
something nicer tuned has warm up the
eye look I'm just going to pack that on
the reason I like this palette and I'm
sure you can find these colors and a lot
of different palettes that you have or
different companies I like that they're
not super warm like brown script or
Sienna
you guys know I love warm tones but I do
feel like these neutral tones keep
everything like a classic look and it
also kind of depends on your dress and
your colors of your bridesmaids so many
different color combinations you could
do this one is just for me like it would
go and pretty much everything taking my
brush and buffing out the edges of
Taishan we just put down on the lid as
far as liner goes there's so many
different ways that Brides choose to
wear their liner some people love the
wing some people don't love the wing
depending on your eye shape you can
either smoke out your lash line do a
smoky smoldery wing of traditional wing
there's black wings I'm going to go
ahead and do a brown liquid wing this is
the Bobbi Brown gold and bronze sparkle
because I love this eyeliner and I feel
like it photographs so nice it makes
gives your eyes just a little sparkle
without looking like glitter so I'm
going to go ahead and pop this on yeah
right I wish I could just pop it on more
of a like let me stress out while I do
this starting from the outer corner i
want to give my eye a little bit of a
list I'm going to first wing it up and
then come back I go thinner as I go into
the inner corner of my eye to give the
eye a more
had I listed list now I'm going to curl
the lashes super important to open up
the eyes
this is Asha Sato lash curler and it's
very important to use waterproof mascara
we all know why we all cry everybody
cries it's like you think you're not
going to cry and all this of your liquid
looking of course something about
weddings and I could go to a wedding of
somebody I don't even know and start
crying no emotional attachment I'm still
crying
so waterproof mascara is key this is by
Too Faced really wiggle is deep enough
that lash base and then pull upwards as
a bride depending on your lashes or your
comfort level you could wear false
lashes or you could skip it you have
really long lashes I don't see why you
would need to wear a lot of false lashes
unless you do individuals on the outer
corner to list the eyes I also recommend
individual lashes if somebody else is
doing your makeup it's really nice to
have that because if you are crying the
glue if it pops your lashes off in one
area that's it like your whole strips
going to be uncomfortable but if you
have individual lashes it's a lot harder
for them to fall off and if you do lose
one it's fine because they're all
individually attached when I used to do
Bridal makeup a lot I would tend to go
towards our gel lashes for people who
aren't comfortable wearing them but they
wanted to just because I feel like they
have a really thin band so they're
comfortable they're really fluffy and
fluttery like these down here there's a
lot of different options from ardell
that you could choose from Tudor wispy
and natural so if you're not comfortable
of lashes i really recommend these i'm
going to go for iconic light these are a
lighter version of iconic you know these
are my favorite and i say whatever you
feel most comfortable and confident
enough that you should wear and if you
have a favorite lash whether it be
natural or dramatic then you should wear
those this is what the iconic life looks
like they're super fluffy they do have a
little thicker of a band than our gels
but they're not as thick as the original
iconic so I feel like these flatter my
eye shape the best I really wish I did
have to use on my wedding day to make
sure your eyelashes are going to fit
comfortably take them off the tray and
you want to first with no glue apply
them to your eye to see how much longer
they are than your natural eye shape so
take little scissors and cut it right
off we don't need you dead weight
and also notice that I didn't cut the
inner corner of the eye because that's
perfectly tapered already you don't to
mess about just cut the outer part now
I'm going to use my house of lashes glue
here make sure you put a generous amount
on the inner and outer corners of your
lashes actually put it all over in the
middle too because if you put too much
on the inner and outer and not in the
center sometimes have you ever noticed
when people blink there's like a little
gap sticking out in the middle because
there's not enough glue there so just
kind of give a generous amount and let
them air dry for 30 to 60 seconds the
tack here the blue is on the strip
before it touches your eye the stronger
it's going to hold I also like to bend
the lashes like this just going to give
it more of a natural eye shape coming
from above starting at the inner corner
really trying to get them as close to my
lash line as possible okay so the glue
is still drying on the lashes but I'm
going to go ahead and tight line the
upper waterline in here with a black
liner this is really important just
because it's going to make sure that no
skin peeks through over here you don't
have any gaps between the lashes and
your lash line if you aren't wearing
false lashes if you do this it's going
to thicken up your lash line and make it
look like you have more lashes than you
do this is the NARS black pencil I would
suggest using a waterproof black liner
don't use Inglot I do that a lot but I
notice that a lot sometimes creeps down
here so waterproof is better anything
you can get more frou-frou wanting to
get it that's where it's at we're going
to finish off the eyes after we finish
off the face makeup and we're just going
to give our upper lashes some time to
dry for foundation on your wedding day
you want to make sure if you have a
foundation that works for your skin type
then wear that even if someone else is
doing your makeup I would recommend
letting them use whatever they want on
the trial after you tell them your skin
type but then if you feel like no this
isn't then go to your foundation for me
and my bridal tea and I always have
makeup / HD I feel like Make Up For Ever
HD is such a good universal foundation
that looks great on a lot of different
skin types and it photographs really
really nice you don't want to use the
foundation with SPF because you're going
to get it flashback super important not
to you know make that mistake I believe
this is the why 245 it's a little life
a little light I'm just going to go
ahead and mix colors to get my color
with my beauty blender I'm going to
apply this we already had enough time
for our primer to really settle into the
skin I'd say this is actually my color
this is why 405 so I'm applying a really
nice light layer first and Myrlie making
sure to press it into the skin if you
apply a little too much foundation I
feel like it could have more of a
tendency to crease in your last lines
and a lot of times we put a lot of
foundation on thinking like oh my god
this is a special occasion
in reality we just want to even on our
skin tone and then anything else that
shows through we can cover it with
concealer that way we have nice all-over
light coverage and heavy coverage only
where you need it a large kabuki like
brush isn't art I have a little bit of
foundation on there and I'm going to
sweep it up the neck to make sure it's
all blended with our foundation on our
face be careful when you do this too you
might want to set it as a powder because
if you have any high neckline if your
wedding dress you don't wanna get
foundation wellness if you have dark
circles and you need to correct that I
would use a color corrector this one's
from Bobbi Brianna it's the peachy
shades that could really help with any
darkness or you could use this buy buy
under eyes this is really sick if you
use a little amount and buff it in it
helps with any hollowness in your eyes
if you have a hollow issue I'm going to
use a tiny bit of that grabbed a little
amount in the back of my hand this isn't
a shade can for me I'm going to take
this brush from cue face it's just a
little blender synthetic for some reason
this eye is a little darker here not too
dark but I like to grab a little 5 by
under eye in this area right here just
in that hollow since we'll make sure it
looks nice and blended if you like a
more lightweight concealer I really love
the Becca luminous it's very easy to
wear it's going to look really natural
if you want more of that natural look
you want full coverage this is a really
good concealer this is a heart-shaped
tape I'm in the shade medium but I don't
want to use too much so I don't want to
overwhelm my under eyes let's do a few
little dots I'm going to blend that in
with my Beauty blenders I do wish this
concealer was around when I got married
because this stuff is like really heavy
duty
that's really nicely I'm going to take a
little concealer on a flat brush like
this urban decay eqo 3 I'm going to
apply that on the outer part of my eye
and clean up the wing with this to make
everything look nice and sharp
adding concealer under your wing makes
such a huge difference because you're
adding that brightness under a dark wing
it makes the wing pop that much more it
looks so much cleaner so with the shape
tape I also like to do a highlighting
look down the nose around the forehead
slim it down give it a nice straight
line look I just let the concealer sit
there for a second and let it set also
on the Cupid's bow and on the chin to
apply a little bit on the high points of
your face it's kinda just going to give
you an all-over balance of all of the
lights and darks with we're going to do
with the bronzer you want to let it sit
for too long and I'm going to blend out
all of that concealer with my Beauty
Blender if you need to use a smaller
brush and smaller detail areas go ahead
and do that I squeeze it like this so
that I don't interrupt my brows here so
you want to make sure to set the
concealer under your eyes because nobody
likes to crease so if you are someone
that's prone to creasing make sure that
you let your makeup artist know a lot of
people like to bake the under eyes
because that helps for them not to
crease if it works for you then do that
method if it doesn't work for you
baking doesn't work for everybody some
people it's a little too drying I really
recommend this as a good universal
powder that could work for everybody as
far as I've seen this is the charlotte
tilbury airbrush flawless finished
powder it's a super super finely milled
powder it's not going to look too cakey
on your face I recommend this for your
wedding day because if you get oily
throughout the night you can touch up
with this powder it's not going to build
up on your skin like other powders tend
to do like you're reapplying reapplying
reapplying this looks like nothing it
just mattifies take that on a morphe
brush doesn't say what types just a
fluffy brush and I'm going to press this
into the under eye tap tapping motion
I'm also going to take this into the
creases of the nose because we all know
how the foundation likes to play you
over here and anywhere I get oily so for
me that's the sides of my nose here and
I like to apply this powder on the
apples of the cheek as well
so now you want to give yourself a glow
I'm going to be using the Estee Lauder
heat wave highlight and this is the a BH
a 23 brush and I'm going to apply the
highlight before I apply any bronze or
anything like that
you can use a cream highlight and then a
liquid but I'm not going to put any
cream on my face because I'm not going
through that dewy look I need everything
to be powder and set so I start in
circular motions on the highest point
just like this and then we're going to
bring it up like this and then around
town you feel like you accidentally
apply too much like I feel like I just
did go over it with your Beauty Blender
push it into the skin top to the
cheekbones and then a little bit up here
on the high points of the forehead if
you get too oily everywhere I would
limit the highlight just to the tops of
the cheekbones taking a smaller brush
I'm going to take that down the bridge
of the nose very lightly on the cube as
well
give yourself that highlight mustache it
always looks crazy at first but then you
put lipstick and stuff over it and you
don't really see it as much though or
like a little highlight on the chin some
people don't like this but I think it
kind of gives your face that overall
glow light emmaus I'm also going to now
take a little bit of this highlight and
apply it in the inner corner of the eye
I have an all-over matte eye but I still
want to tie in a little shimmer all
right so now we have that overall glowy
angelic look which is what I'm going for
very happy about it
we're going to brawn and I'm not going
to go crazy with the bronzer I'm using
hoola by benefit this is a really nice
one and I'm going to pick it up with
this huge japanesse brush I'm going to
start with the forehead sometimes I feel
like my forehead photographs all it's
just like everyone told me I'm crazy but
that's just you know we all have our
things about ourselves so I'm going to
put bronzer here to try to shorten it
out a little bit push it into the
hairline all those little baby hairs
need love too so now I'm taking this
smaller japonesque brush I'm going to
take that into the contours of the face
so I like my bronzer to really blend
into the highlight I like to apply the
highlight first because it just looks
better that way to me it also gives you
a nice guide as to where your cheekbones
are and
could hug the cheekbone with the
highlight if you need to contour the
nose then go ahead and do that now at
this time I'm going to use hoola bronzer
still for that I'm just going to do the
tip of the nose to make it look a little
bit more narrow after you do your makeup
if you do heavy contouring take a
picture before you go out I swear
there's so many times where I've done my
contour and I thought it was so good and
I went outside look whoa or I took a
picture and you could really see what's
going on so I just put the powder on the
very tip of the nose to refine it and
then whatever is left over on the brush
I'll take us we're almost done guys I
see the light at the end of the tunnel
it's coming to a close here for blush
this is always one of my favorite
blushes to use on brides I love this
blush it's one of my favorites it's Mac
peaches so I'm going to apply that to
the cheap and depending on people's face
shape you always want to apply your
blush in different areas to give
yourself a different effect some people
don't like the blush on the apples of
the cheeks I feel like that gives you a
youthful look although some people don't
like that I love it if you have a more
round face and you want to kind of make
yourself look more like that you would
put the blush a little bit higher up but
for me I kind of like that folly cheeky
look so I like to smile apply right
there and I'm lightly patting and
sweeping upwards into the bronzer so
finishing off the eyes I'm going to take
the same palette
get this party started here taking the
dark brown shade on a discolored pencil
brush and applying that on the outer
part of the eye here if you want to keep
with that look of the eye so whatever is
left over on the brush I'm going to
lightly run that into the inner corner
but keep it not as heavy as the outer
part of the eye sometimes I like to
deepen the smoke a little bit more just
on the outer corner so I'm going to take
Americano this is by makeup geek with an
angled brush and push that into the
lashes and I'm just doing that only on
this outer part of the eye so depending
on your preference some people like to
put a brown liner in the lash line some
people like to open up the eyes with a
more nude liner and some people really
love black liner so it's all preference
as to what you like I have really small
eyes so I like to open them up a little
bit
or and add brightness I'm going to be
using the Tarte
Seca way you know what works really good
for this as well which I really love is
the benefit high brow that does not move
at all in the waterline I'm just going
to lightly run that along the waterline
for my lower lashes I personally would
use a waterproof mascara but for the
sake of this video and my baby ass
lashes I'm going to use the Tarte one
because this is the only one that really
makes my lower lashes look thicker and
more use a waterproof mascara 100%
definitely grazing over my lashes this
cloth boards not going away so I like to
give myself a beauty mark you guys
noticed tight over it with a little
powder so it looks a little more natural
and I just used the melt rock eyeshadow
so the last thing we're gonna do is lip
color depending on what you like I feel
like you want to use a lip color that's
not super nude I think I went a little
too nude looking back at my photos it
was like a little too pinky nude and
light for my face if I were to go back I
would choose something a little bit more
lively something that has life looks
like your lips are blushing from within
so we're going to try out this bite
Beauty lip liner this is in the shade
0:20 using this first all over your lips
and really working the lip liner into
your list because that's going to be a
second barrier so once your first your
lipstick fades away you're going to have
this hard pencil liner at the base so
it's not going to go straight to like oh
 you need to reapply there's going
to be a nice space under there for you
so really work that in take your finger
and push it in to your lips for the lip
color you can go with something a little
bit more rosy this is it liquid lipstick
viagra lactic is called bashful or you
can go with a lip cream I'm even go with
a lipstick too it just kind of depends
on whether you want something is going
to not come off which I personally like
lip creams are a little bit easier to
reapply the last catch don't forget
setting spray setting spray is so
important for your wedding day whatever
skin type you have use a setting spray
and I find that this one's the best
Urban Decay all-nighters
classic classic never Donna honey
this is definitely to help the longevity
of your makeup wear all night okay so
this is the finished makeup look it's
just soft classic timeless for any
brides out there who are getting married
congratulations and don't be too nervous
it's very fun and exciting honestly you
don't even remember all the stuff you
stressed about you just remember how
much fun you had so good luck at your
wedding and thank you guys so much for
