I know and a few people told me that
brow tinting isn't allowed in certain
states and in other states it's totally
allowed her businesses in Australia and
she has too long there and it's like
legit over there it kind of one of those
things check to see if your state allows
brow tinting it's a whole like dye close
to your eye type of situation I believe
for safety reasons but I know people out
here in California be bleaching their
brows okay that's I mean I know that
just wanted to vlog the whole experience
and you know if you guys are somewhere
abroad tinting is allowed I totally
recommend it especially if you have a
little getaway and you just want to be
waking up with brow zones but anyways
that's just my disclaimer look it up and
yeah let's go ahead and do this hello
hey guys welcome back to my channel
today's video is going to be a little
more casual
because I'm doing something very
exciting and I was like you know what I
want to do this and vlog it to show you
guys and see what it's all about today
we are going to be trying brow tinting
and I don't mean just like brow hair to
take okay because when I think of brow
tensing I think they just tint your
actual brow hairs but I don't have a
problem with like the tint of my hairs
I'm a problem with lack of hair and I
have thought about micro bleeding and I
know a lot of you guys ask me how I feel
about micro bleeding but to me it's like
very permanent and doing YouTube videos
I feel like it's so nice for me to be
able to manipulate my brows in different
ways and I feel like if I do something
permanent like a micro bleeding tattoo
that I won't be able to do certain looks
also I'm very picky and I'm like what if
I hate it
what if I don't love the micro bleeding
with that said there is somebody on
Instagram that I always see they're
micro bleeding photos and I'm like if I
ever decided to do that I will go with
her and only her in the description box
her name is hailey she's amazing she's
also a makeup artist so I
I can trust that she understands like
the brow shapes they look so good and
don't get me wrong I love doing my
eyebrows is one of my favorite things to
do about my makeup everything brows is
like where it's at
so the other not go to a party and I ran
into JD waiting and she introduced me to
her friend and she's like how's my
friend she was brought in Jing and my
mind obviously went to like brow tinting
brow hairs and I was like oh that's
really really awesome and I was like
then nice to meet you and then JD was
like yes she did my rosy other day and I
was like oh that's nice you have makeup
on over there though right and she said
no that her brows were just the tint and
she had to put no makeup on she just
woke up and she had brows and I was like
I said let me see I was up in her brows
and I thought it was the coolest thing
ever and I've never heard of that before
she actually tints the whole shape of
the brow so that it looks like you have
a filled-in brow she's from Australia
but she's visiting right now I've never
seen this done before and the best part
about this is it's not permanent it only
lasts for six weeks so if you don't like
it so we were gonna be filming the
process today if you go amazing or it
could just go terribly bad for me I
don't know it's risky I'm gonna finish
doing my hair so I don't look so crazy
when she comes over and then I'm going
to show you guys the process and we'll
see how this goes okay we shall see take
a good look at my brows before okay
these are my before brows struggle brows
boom Melanie's here to do this so my
name is Melanie I hope Australia so this
is my method of brow hunting it gives
you a slight stain on the skin so
basically the pomade mm-hmm that's sort
of a look with like a natural front fade
through the front you can achieve this
using tint for you I would mix half and
half of these shades so this is light
brown and this is natural brown and then
we've got the peroxide here and we just
mix it to an even consistency
they're like my Isis but I think it set
up because warehouse change styles
change late you know
maybe imagine like thin browser like
what was it okay the guys when you get
that yeah - brows come over mom I feel
like pieces as full as they can get
because basically these car trainees as
well as forwards as you can't really
like especially for this cuz I was
telling them earlier I'm like I like
changing with like actually I do some
different like my dad I always prefer
home before I go anywhere
and before I can tell by the way that
you was like whoa
you know I love filling in my brows like
something I'd like to enjoy doing so
that's why I also you know for me or
what I do
and his eye changes
I feel like the straight part I always
like what I do it this straight part of
this one is longer but the end is
shorter yeah and your watch on this side
is actually a lot finer yeah it's a
little bit I can never get the torches
when I pencil them in like completely
that's really normal
so our wiping off tint
it would've been done yep that's crazy
it looks like just powder it has give us
out the door on time it might reveal I'm
gonna look in the mirror oh my goodness
this is crazy it seriously just looks
like powder do you know how fast I want
to get ready you know like this is
insane
I love I just oh this is insane boom
boom brow tinting y'all get into it I
so cool this is the after brow let me
get up in it okay this is no makeup in
the hair it's just the tint
it's not permanent it lasts four to six
weeks and then it's gone it's like a
Cinderella brow but I mean this is
insane the fact that I can just wake up
like this and go to the gym is so
amazing this is a really good
alternative to micro flighting if you
don't want anything permanent because
this is not permanent
waking up with brows what a life changer
what a game-changer I hope you guys
enjoyed my process I give this
experience a definite thumbs up I am
living for it dying for it oh my god
alright just checking in on you guys
this is an update it's been two days
some parts are fading like this part
right here was just I have no hair
whatsoever there so the tin didn't
really pick up as strongly as it did on
the other side but honestly it's like if
I just have to take a pencil to that
part of my brow I'm not complaining it's
not a big deal make sure you check out
Melanie's Instagram page she has a bunch
of transformations on there and you guys
could see a little bit more and if you
have any questions that I didn't cover
in this video I'm sure she has all her
information on her website and her
Instagram so go ahead and check it out
bye
am i right or what the hell hello oh
wait it's not focused on me get my
camera hates me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
