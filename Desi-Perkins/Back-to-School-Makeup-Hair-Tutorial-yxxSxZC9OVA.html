are you listening deal
a little pimple sure should I put a
little bit of dish
you always want to prime your skin
especially long day at escuela
you gotta prime that skin I'm using the
cover effects illuminating primer this
one is my favorite at the moment just
because it makes your skin look really
dewy and healthy roberto l'oreal
infallible Pro matte I'm using a Beauty
Blender and I'm just going to stipple
that on to the skin
I like this foundation because it covers
everything and it lasts all day oh my
god I'm doing my foundation before my
eyebrows I usually never do that but I
forgot I'm gonna go straight in with
concealer this is the Dior skin star
concealer and the shade 0:03
I'm just going to go ahead and blend it
out with my Beauty Blender I'm going to
use the city color HD powder this is
just a translucent powder hold please
I'm not going to bake it I'm just going
to lightly dust it over the concealer
and this is one of my favorite brushes
at the moment it's a japanesse 915
so next I'm going in with some bronzer
you guys know my favorite is Max give me
Sun and I'm going to warm my face up
with this using a boob this is a 1:26
zueva brush
so bronzer is good for school because it
has a big impact on the way your face
looks but it's also really easy and it's
also really quick so I'm just gonna
quickly bronze up musk in my forehead
same old stuff that I always do you want
to get the jawline as well so you look
nice and chiseled NARS Copacabana
Copacabana - cream highlight just going
to take a little bit of that on my
finger and apply it to the tops of my
cheekbones cream products are nice
because it means less brushes you
usually use your finger with the cream
product so that's always quicker and it
kind of just looks a little bit more
radiant a little bit more dewy gokabou
not gonna put a little bit of that on
the tip of my nose and the Cupid's bow
keeping with all the cream products I'm
gonna go in with a cream blush as well
just cuz it's a lot quicker is the dahle
Ted and beauty cream blush in the shade
flirt it's a hydrogel blush and I'm just
gonna go in with my fingers I like to
with cream blushes because they can be
super pigmented kind of go on the back
of my hand first and take off most of
the product and this is just gonna give
you a nice like a nice flush with the
cream blush
and because we used a matte foundation
all these cream products are just going
to make us look really radiant but
you're still going to look matte
everywhere else and you're only going to
look dewy in these areas finally I'm
doing my eyebrows this is the Marc
Jacobs eyebrow pencil I'm an ash Brown
I'm gonna try to keep more of a natural
brow look just kind of filling in any
sparse areas I don't really want to go
for that like really crazy defined brow
today to save time I actually put a
light layer foundation over my eyelids
when I was doing my base so I'm not
going to use an eyeshadow base instead
I'm just gonna go straight into a shadow
and when I was in high school I actually
don't remember wearing a lot of
eyeshadow um I always wore winged
eyeliner like that was always my thing
but I'm gonna add just a little judge
I'm using this palette which I think is
perfect for school this is the lorac pro
matte palette it's this little mini
palette with an eyelash stuck to it of
course because it wouldn't be mine if
there wasn't a fake eyelash stuck to it
but it just has all the perfect colors
for like everyday looks and you can do a
bunch of different looks with it so I'm
going to pick up a latte here because
it's really light and I'm just going to
lightly dab my brush into corduroy I'm
using a Mac 217 and I'm just going to
add a little bit of definition into my
crease with this and I almost want it to
look just like a natural shadow so you
don't want to go too heavy with it
I'm also gonna add that same mixture of
eyeshadows to the lower lash line if you
are blessed with long lower lashes you
may not even have to do this because
mascara on the lower lashes will add
enough definition to your eyes to make
them pop me because I don't have lower
lashes I like to always add just a
little shadow under the eye to really
define my eyes without using any harsh
eyeliners so I'm going in with the
detailed shader brush - 3 7 by zoeva I'm
going to do the same mixture of those
two eyeshadows and pop it on right under
the lash line just define mostly on the
outer portion of the eye with the same
palette I'm taking bare which is just a
bone color like right here with the same
brush after I cleaned the brush off on
my hand because that's how I do and I'm
going to apply it to my brow bone just
to give a little bit of a highlight just
a matte highlight you know I don't
really want to get too crazy with like a
shimmer highlight and I'm also going to
use that in the inner corner of my eye
so for the lid I'm going to be using a
really nice gold shimmer eyeshadow you
guys could keep it matte like this you
don't have to use a shimmer but I feel
like it adds a little Judge so this is
in the shade sorcery actually going to
dampen my brush with a little bit of
fix+
just to make the color appear more
metallic it almost applies like a cream
the cream eyeshadow but then it dries
like a powder so it's not going to
crease I always wore liquid eyeliner I
think I started wearing liquid eyeliner
when I was 12 my dad told me I looked
like Cleopatra the Kat Von D tattoo
liner in the shade Mad Max Brown
lately I've been really liking to make
my wing like kind of dramatic on the
outer corner but then as I get in I've
been really tapering it off and not
making it thick all the way in just kind
of starting to feather it off into the
lashline around here and I find that
this gives me more of a like you know
kind of shape if you have rounder eyes
and you want your eyes to look more
almond II this is the best way for you
to do eyeliner I'm using today the NARS
audacious mascara this is new from NARS
so I'm just going to apply a few coats
of this
bottom lashes as well so to open up the
eyes this is my favorite liner for the
rim so we call it the inner rim this is
a NARS I always forget the name even
though I use it all the time
rue Bonaparte I know that the majority
of people will not wear fake eyelashes I
mean actually I don't know do you guys
wear fake eyelashes to school I would
and today I'm using flutter lashes
there's no name on the box so I'm using
flutter lashes I will try to find the
name it's not on the box right so I'm
going to go in with these lashes they're
very natural-looking I'm going to pop
them on real quick there I've got some
good lashes going now for lipstick I'm
going to use just like a natural pinky
undertone lipstick this one is by Noah
it's called desert rose oh this is like
super pink ochre this lipstick is really
hydrating so it kind of acts like a
chopstick it feels like a chopstick
actually if this is like too pink for
you for you know casual day what I like
to do is take my finger and kind of work
it into the lips
you
actually got this mark-anthony this is
the argan oil of Morocco in the ipsy
glambag to put some of this oil in my
hair so my hair smells good also my hair
is dead right now it's legit I think I'm
going bald I know the first day you may
want to wear it down I'm gonna go ahead
and just can we go down I don't want
people to see my armpits thank you
Jeff you know I don't know armpit thank
you when it came to school I always had
it in a messy bun always so I just like
to wrap it around sometimes it works
