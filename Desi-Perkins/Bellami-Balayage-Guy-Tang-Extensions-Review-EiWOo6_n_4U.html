today I'm actually going to be doing a
review I think this is the first review
I've ever done it's going to be on the
new Bellamy balayage
guy tank extensions I'm super excited to
do this review because I love this
product I posted a photo of me wearing
them about a week ago and everybody
asked me a ton of questions about them
so I wanted to kind of answer all of
your questions in one video this is not
a sponsored video at all I just wanted
to share all of my information about
these with you guys because I love them
and I'm an extension obsessed person so
I know there's a ton of you guys out
there who are curious about this horror
so with that said let's get started so
the extensions come in a box like this
it's really nice because it comes in a
box that you could actually put your
extensions away in when you're not
wearing them and on the back it has a
picture of the gorgeous guy tongue and
it has a little info about the balayage
extensions and then you open the box up
like these and of course there's
extensions in there when you get them
but I took them out already also came
with this extension hair brush which
looks like a little mouse clicker and
this is actually specially made for
brushing extensions because if you use a
regular hair brush sometimes it can
really pull the hair out of the wefts
and you don't want that because then
your extensions are gonna start looking
really thin and nappy and gross the type
of extensions I got were the Bellamy
baleog eye Tang extensions of course and
these are the 22 grams and that's the
amount of hair that comes all together
and 22 grams is a lot of hair the
average extensions usually come with
about 60 to 120 grams which is really
little it's not a lot of hair so if you
have thick hair these extensions are
good the 20 the two the 220 grams are
good for you if you have thick hair and
I got the 22 inch extensions and the
color is 8 / 60 I've actually worn these
a couple times so don't judge me they
look better when you get them of course
this is the night before styled hair so
this is the color that I got and it's a
perfect match for my hair the top is
light brown and it fades into a super
blonde color as you guys can see here
this is a lot blonder than my ends of
course so what I like about this is that
when I put them in my hair it looks like
I have extremely blond end and I get
that effect without having to put all
the bleach on my actual hair we're going
to get 10 pieces of hair in this box
you're going to get 1/8 inch weft one 7
inch weft 2 6 inch webs 2 4 inch webs
and for 1.5 inch webs and those are the
really really tiny one those are these
right here these little tiny little guys
some people put these in I personally
don't use these little ones ever when I
have extensions because it's just a lot
of time for me like I don't got time to
put in these little ones so I don't use
these but it comes with four of them if
you do use them some people like to put
them in the front this is the 8 inch
weft here which is the largest West that
comes in the box then it comes with two
six-inch weft which are this size right
here and then you get of course the two
four inch wefts
which are these right her and then of
course I should you guys the tiny ones
so the extensions are 100% remy human
hair so you can do whatever you do to
your own hair to these extensions you
can curl them you can dye them you can I
don't know what you do with your hair at
home but you can do that to these
extensions so one thing I wanted to
point out is that the top of these
extensions don't exactly match the top
of my roots in my own hair if you guys
can see it's a little bit lighter than
my actual root color but it's totally
okay because they actually end up
blending flawlessly anyways dye Tang has
a video on his YouTube channel where he
does them on a model whose hair is a lot
darker at the base but they blend
perfectly I'm going to just go over the
way it's colored
so these are so beautifully dyed I mean
if you have looked at any other
extensions on the market as far as ombre
or balayage they are so ratchet like
there's a sharp line going across the
extensions and you do not want that you
ideally want the light color to
seamlessly blend into the darker shade
and you don't want to see a trace of
where the highlights start and that's
pretty much guy Tang specialties at
doing that and that's pretty much what
he did with these extensions like you
cannot see where the light meets into
the the darker part it pretty much just
like fades flawlessly ok so now to the
part that nobody likes to talk about
which is the price point on these
extensions they do vary depending on how
many grams you get in the length I'm
just going to go into what I have I have
the 220 gram extensions and they are 22
inches and of course they're the
balayage
extensions and these go on their website
for 279 and I know that price can be a
little steep but I justify it as they
are amazing quality and they're gorgeous
beautifully blended the amount of hair
you're getting is outrageous my overall
thoughts on these extensions if it
hasn't already been apparent is that I'm
obsessed with them I love them so much I
love the color I love the thickness the
quality they hold curls really well and
the clips stay in really good so a lot
of extensions the clips won't really
stay in your hair that well and they
kind of slide out I find that I don't
even need to tease my hair with these I
know it's recommended to tease when you
put them in I don't I'm going to go
ahead and put these on so I could show
you guys what they look like on my head
that would make sense for you to see
them I'm not going to use these little
wefts those so you're aware they're not
in there I went ahead and clipped in the
extensions and I feel like I've
completely transformed as a person like
I feel like Khaleesi from Game of
Thrones or like Beyonce or somebody like
I don't know princess want to show you
guys how well these extensions blend
with my hair if I take a brush to them
you really can't even see where my hair
is where the extensions
are they just cascade so beautifully
also I wanted to mention a lot of you
guys asked me about my hair color and
where I get my hair done my hairdresser
is actually Bo da de and I will put his
Instagram info in the description box he
is an amazing colorist and you guys can
go ahead and check his Instagram for
questions or appointments or anything
like that just because I always get
asked about my hair and I don't dye it
myself so I don't know what colors he
uses or anything like that but yeah I
hope that answers some of your questions
but that is it for my review on the
Bellamy balayage extensions I hope that
I did a good job and answered all of
your questions because this is my first
review thumbs up if you enjoyed this
type of video also if you have any other
questions that I maybe didn't answer go
ahead and leave them in the comments
below or you can check out the website
I'm sure they have a ton of info there
as well and yeah I hope you guys enjoyed
the video and I'll see you guys next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
