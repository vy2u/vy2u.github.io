for today's tutorial I'm gonna be
showing you how to get this hair you
guys have been requesting it a lot
lately and it's probably because I've
been wearing it like every single day
it's become my favorite hairstyle of all
of times it's just like who doesn't love
big intentionally wait I mean who
doesn't love intentional frizz right
let's go ahead and get started so the
first thing you need is a curling wand
the one that I am obsessed with is the
Bellamy wand this is the 25 millimeter
barrel one comes in a set with a few
different barrels that you can detach
and attach sea salt spray I specifically
love this one it's been making my hair
super lioness Sun bum sea spray beach
formula you're also going to need a hair
spray I've just been using this bumble
and bumble spray damad this is just a
pretty light hold hairspray and lastly a
teasing comb if you want to really just
like fluff it up my hair extensions are
Bellomy 860 is the color and these are
the ones they did in collaboration with
guy taining I did a whole video
reviewing them so I'll link that down
below for you guys I'm gonna first
section off the hair half of it so it's
not going to be the sexiest thing but
just sectioning off the technique for
this is actually very easy and very
quick so take your hairspray make sure
it's a light hold hairspray and just
lightly mist brush it out OOP ate some
of that first thing I'm gonna do is take
a section of hair and I'm just going to
take my wand point it downwards like
this and lightly wrap that hair around
the wand
and then release so the technique for
the next piece of hair is you want to
take it in the opposite direction as the
first piece so the first piece we curled
it away from our face this second piece
let's curl it towards our face and a few
seconds just a few seconds and release
boom so by curling the hair in different
directions it makes it look more natural
and it's also going to give you more
volume because if you curl all the hair
the same way sometimes they tend to
stick together and just kind of create
like Hollywood waves and you don't want
that you want more of a beachy natural
wave so yeah you're going to keep doing
that throughout your whole head you have
to make sure that you leave space in
between the hair and the barrel so you
see how none of the hair is touching
each other in the curl it's all like
separate
so the loser you could get the wave
around the barrel the better sometimes
as I'm holding the curl I twist the end
of the hair because I want it to stay
together and it's little curl so I kind
of just like rub the ends together not
sure if that does anything but I did get
my hair done once by stylist and she did
that and I was like what is happening
there I don't know what it was purpose
was but like I do it now and it works so
and then as I'm going through the hair I
like to just alternate the size of hair
strands that I pick up so bigger ones
smaller ones Channel
you
all right and then also a lot of people
ask me how I blend extensions with my
hair when I'm curling it don't cool your
own hair first and then your extensions
like I have my own hair in here and I'm
mixing it with the extension here and
I'm going to curl it all as one piece so
that way the curls flow together like
the natural hair and the extensions flow
together and yeah I think that's the
trick to really blending the extensions
don't do the extensions first and then
the hair see how it looks like one piece
of hair it's not it's not my hair unless
you're the better really piece them up
get that phrase going so now it's time
for the last section which is the top so
I'm gonna go ahead and show you guys how
I make my bangs to frame my face I take
the small section here and I'm gonna
grab my curler and just hold it down
flat and wrap my hair around away from
my face we're just gonna keep doing the
same thing we've been doing throughout
the whole hair except with the top
sections if you have layers like I do or
if you have a real hair and then fake
hair down here you want to keep these
even looser than these because if these
are super tight curls it's going to
bunch up and you're going to tell the
difference between your top hair and
your not your hair
so now that we have curled all the hair
we're going to add some salt spray and
just going to generously add this to the
hair and just kind of start fluffing it
up like crunching it like in the old
days you know you remember when you used
to put gel in your hair and crunch it up
everyone did it don't lie
you want that chiquita head huh
no no shaquita we have to say it with
accent chic at the beach spray really
gets your hair nice and textured but if
you even want to get even more crazy
with it you can get a teasing comb and
then just kind of pick up sections oh
and I just like to just backcomb them a
little bit underneath so I can have you
been bigger here alright so then just
give it one last spray with some
hairspray that's pretty much it that's
how you get these really effortless
beachy waves I really hope that you
enjoyed it don't forget to snapchat me
if you try to do this hairstyle or
Instagram hashtag does e makeup or
Twitter because I love that too so yeah
