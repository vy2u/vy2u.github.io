today I'm going to show you guys how to
get this big sexy lioness type hair I
absolutely love it and I'm actually
going to be using this kiss instawave
curling iron which is a new product for
me it's basically just like a curling
wand however instead of having to wrap
it yourself the curler wraps it for you
by pushing this button which i think is
absolutely genius because I can't even
tell you guys how many times I've burned
myself trying to wrap my hair around a
wand I find that it gives you such a
good voluminous
effect and I'm going to show you guys
how to go ahead and use it this curling
iron so if you're interested in this
hairstyle then keep on watching so the
first thing you want to do with any
hairstyle is of course make sure that
you brush your hair out make sure you
have no tangles no knots and that your
hair is ready to go next just want to go
ahead and take half of your hair and
clip it up into a clip so that you can
start off working with just the bottom
section just going to grab about one to
two inch sized pieces of hair you don't
want to grab all the same size because I
want to go for more of a wild more
unruly natural curl I guess you would
say with this curling iron you it's very
interesting you go ahead and place your
hair into the slot and then there's a
button so you can curl it inwards or
outwards so as you can see you can go
I'm going to go ahead and go inwards
and then it's gonna go all the way up
and then you just unleash Oh what's
going away boom what's cool about this
curling iron is no matter which hand
you're holding the curling iron with or
what direction it still creates the same
beautiful curls whereas with other
curling irons you kind of have to hold
them a certain direction in order to get
the same wave on each side I definitely
think that this curling iron is going to
work for any hair type so if you have
curly hair straight hair wavy hair I
think the way that these prongs are set
up it's going to go ahead and twirl any
type of texture as long as you brush
through those knots or tangles that you
have in your own hair
so that is the bottom section done and
now we're going to go ahead and curl the
top section so let your hair down and
I'm just going to start going at random
and grabbing random pieces and starting
to curl them
up in the eyelash
oh yeah
you
so for this hairstyle is totally okay if
you curl the curls in two different
directions you can curl them in and out
that's also going to help give it more
of that natural curly texture
well not natural but you know what I
mean more organic that's a good word
organic curl now that we have a curled
all the hair I'm going to give it a
spray with a little bit of hairspray so
the curls are looking kind of crazy now
just take your fingers and run it
through the hair all right now I'm going
to go ahead and grab a comb and I'm just
going to start teasing it slightly
because I want this to look really big
and lioness
if you want to you can also flip your
head upside down and spray it while your
head is upside down so that you get a
little bit more volume as well I'm going
to go ahead and do that
alright guys so this is the finished
look I hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial and that you found it helpful

hopefully you know I can save some of
you guys can burning your fingers
