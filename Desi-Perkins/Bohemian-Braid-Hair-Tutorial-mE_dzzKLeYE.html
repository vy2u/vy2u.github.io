for today's video we're gonna do a hair
tutorial I really wanted to throw some
other types of videos into my channel
that aren't always just like makeup
tutorial makeup tutorial makeup tutorial
of desert I posted another makeup
tutorial I have posted hair tutorials in
the past but it's been a while so I
actually saw a photo on Instagram and it
was like one of those Pinterest street
tint can't say that word
Pinterest II type of photos I thought it
was the cutest hairstyle though if you
guys are interested in how to get the
texture of the hair and also the
hairstyle then go ahead and keep on
watching so first I'm just going to pull
half my hair up and out of the way
because we're going to start waving at
the bottom half of our hair so I'm just
going to take a tiny little section of
my hair and I'm going to be waving my
hair with a straightener just because
it's going to give me a more organic
type of wave and I'm using the Eva NYC
this is the healthy heat ceramic styling
iron and I'm just going to take the
tiniest sections and pull them through
this is actually my first time curling
my hair with a straightener and I had a
little bit of difficulty but you get the
hang of it and it becomes a lot easier
as you can see Walla so I really just
like that with a straightener you can
straighten your hair and also curl it
now that I'm done with the bottom half
I'm going to do the same thing to the
top half and if you guys don't know how
to curl with a straightener let me show
you you're gonna take a small section
and you're just gonna curl it away once
away from your face and then pull it
through the theory is similar to when
you want to curl the string of the
balloon with scissors you're gonna take
a small piece and you're going to put it
between the clamp bend it away from your
face and then just pull through and I
like to twist the pieces afterwards just
so they set in that really nice PC
texture it's just going to give us a
more beachy look
all right so I'm going to tease the
crown of my head just slightly because I
want a little bit of volume in this area
I'm just taking a teasing brush you guys
can get this at any video supply store
and I'm going to lightly tease at the
top of my head here like you guys can
see next we're going to just section off
half of the side of our hair as you guys
can see right here nothing too perfect
just grab the section and then you're
going to split that section into two
sections because we're going to be
creating two braids so I'm just going to
start braiding my hair like normal you
guys could definitely French braid but
I'm a little bit slow when it comes to
French braiding so I'm just siding to do
a normal braid I'm just going to braid
that all the way down and then before
you tie that with an elastic band
just pull at the sides of the braids
because this is going to give it a
thicker appearance a more messy it's
gonna be a little bit more bohemian and
it's just going to make it look like you
have a little bit more hair in that
braid when really it's not that much
hair so I just like to kind of go
through the whole thing and pull at
those sides and I'm just going to take a
clear elastic band and tie the end of
that braid up and after you tie it give
it one last tug to make sure it's as
fluffy as possible and I'm just going to
take the second section and do the same
exact thing that we did on the first
section
so now that we have our braids done
we're just going to take our hair tie
and put our hair pretty much up in just
a normal ponytail and before I tie it I
like to kind of mess with it pull out
some hair so that it looks a little bit
more effortless these hairs are just
going to frame your face and I'm just
going to do the same thing on the other
side and then you can kind of lay your
braid down how you want them to be in
your ponytail so just kind of mess with
it until you're happy with how it looks
and then once you're happy with it just
go ahead and tie it with that hair tie
so anytime I do a ponytail I love to
hide at the hair tie so I'm going to
take a little section from the bottom of
the ponytail and I'm going to wrap it
around our hair tie and then after you
wrap it you're just going to go ahead
and take some bobby pins and pin
and then lastly I like to bobby pin any
pieces of hair that are you know going
cray cray up here like this one and that
is the last step to the look guys
alright guys so that is it for this
tutorial thank you guys so much for
watching if you guys like hair tutorials
