today I bring to you this makeup look
right here so this video is produced in
association with target for this video
I'm going to be using all natural beauty
products which I've never done before
and I knew I wanted to do a bolder
makeup look but I didn't want it to be
too overpowering I wanted to enhance my
natural features so I definitely picked
blue because blue will make brown eyes
pop a little bit more just like rustic
colors make green eyes pop I also want
to do something really quirky so I use
these lower lashes I just love how they
give like a kind of doll-like effect I
feel like for spring bold colors are
gonna be in especially when it comes to
liners usually it's more of like bold
lips but I feel like this spring it's
gonna be more liners in the waterline
the wings lots of lashes always lots of
lashes if you guys wanted to recreate
this look you could definitely adjust it
to more your style I think the only
thing that's really different are these
lower lashes and if you wanted to you
just skip the lower lash part it's funny
how when I was younger I had no problems
being bold I wasn't afraid of color I
was just so obsessed with blue glitter
blue everything blue was kind of my bold
when I first started playing with makeup
and I would just pack on gold glitter
blue liner I thought I was slaying the
game back then I still think I was
honestly I don't care I get a little bit
intimidated by color you guys know this
about me I'm always wearing neutrals you
get into these comfort zones you know so
I encourage you guys to step outside of
your comfort zone and create a look that
maybe you wouldn't really do so that's
kind of what I'm doing and I really hope
that you guys enjoy it so let's go ahead
and get started with the tutorial so I
already went ahead and I have one eye
done I've applied my base to my lid now
I'm just gonna set the base with a bone
colored eye shadow you guys can also use
translucent powder and just basically
what this step is is just setting any
cream that you applied to your lid so
that way all the powders just blend
really easily over top so I'm just
lightly dusting the bone colored shadow
all over and this is also going to work
as my lid color so just making sure to
get this whole lid covered up with the
eyeshadow as well so the next thing I'm
going to do is take a bright blue pencil
liner this one is by Pixie and it's
called cobalt blue and I'm actually
going to pick that up on a liner brush
because I want to create this wing and
it's a little bit harder to create it
straight from the tube so I just like to
take a little bit and start to apply
that to my brush and the eyeliner is
pretty creamy so it's not going to be
too difficult to do this but if you do
want to apply it straight from the tube
just sharpen the eyeliner really well so
I just loaded up some of that product on
the liner brush I'm just going to set my
pinky down to really anchor and balance
my hand slowly begin to build the shape
since this isn't an actual gel liner you
are going to have to build it up I'm
having a light layer right now because I
just want to draw my shape out really
quick so I don't want to go in too heavy
just in case I mess up kind of make sure
my wings are even
and so now that I have the initial shape
I'm gonna start layering that blue liner
so that it gets nice and opaque just
like this eyes there we go
all right so keeping with the blue theme
we're gonna go into this cobalt blue
eyeshadow in an angled brush this is a
palette by pixie and it's called the
aquamarine dream I'm going to dip into
that with the angled brush and this part
is actually fairly easy because we're
just going to connect a line from the
liner to like almost halfway into our
crease it's a lot easier doing it this
way than it is a normal traditional cut
crease you're just going to take your
brush once again anchor your finger look
forward so that you can see where your
creases and then just draw a line really
so once I get that straight line I'm
going to take a pencil brush and just
lightly buff out the edge you're just
using one eyeshadow you don't need to
blend too much cuz we do kind of want to
keep it a triangle on this outer V
really sharp so you don't have to use
any transition colors or anything you
can just blend this little blue line up
super easy you don't need to apply a lot
of eyeshadow just that little line
buffed out after I blend it I apply a
little bit more blue eyeshadow just to
the very edge closest to my lid that way
this part is the darkest and then it
fades into just a little smoke of blue
if you're still not expert at blending
and maybe you have some edges you want
to clean up take a concealer brush that
maybe you used for your concealer but
there's really not much left on it and
lightly graze over any areas that maybe
went out of control
maybe you'll went a little too far maybe
your eye shadows in your brow bone I
don't know you know what I mean but some
things happen sometimes there's easy
ways to fix those things I'm going to go
in one more time with that dark blue
eyes
the cool thing about this look is that
it's really easy it uses really little
product but it's a very bowl without
being too like crazy colorful
I mean it's colorful but it's an
understated colorful say blues not your
color you can definitely do this with
any color that you want or you could
make your liner blue and your crease
could just be brown but I really think
it's cool to have the blue with the blue
because it gives it like a really cool
geometric shape edgy don't be afraid to
be bold do not be afraid to be bold okay
all right so that's pretty much it for
the eyeshadow it's super simple
one shadow color that's all you need and
then I'm just gonna go straight in with
mascara this one is by well people and
it's called the expressionist mascara
I'm just gonna apply a lot of coats of
this to the top and bottom lashes as you
guys can see this look is pretty lashy
you don't have to apply false lashes if
you don't want to with this look you can
definitely just add a bunch of mascara
and be done houston we have a problem
over here I try to make some bottom
lashes I think this one is just going
against the grain all right
so we're just gonna go ahead and apply
some natural looking lashes and these
are by Ardell and they're whiskey's
these are some of my favorite lashes
especially for beginners if you are not
as good as putting on false lashes I
really like these because they have a
super thin band and they're lightweight
you can't feel them as much as other
lashes just going to go ahead and pull
these on and the reason you want to use
a more natural lash is because I really
want the blue liner to pop through and
sometimes on the lashes are too thick it
may cover up the blue liner and that's
the star of the show so you want to look
down and just start in the middle take a
deep breath and then connect the outer
and inner corners it's always easiest to
just start in the middle and then
connect the corners I like to kind of
give them a little bit of a lift just so
they kind of fan up I feel like this
look is really really good for spring
coming up just because in spring you
want to play with pops of color will do
it with their lips and I feel like lips
is always the go-to like a bold bright
lip but I think that this time around
it's going to be bold pops of liner and
what I did on this side
promised you guys like two seconds ago
they looked great and then I got this
eyelash stuck to my top eyelash and now
it's just being disobedient but what I
did was I took the Ardell whispies
another pair I cut two little sections
these two sections are here this the
shortest ones flip them upside down and
then use them as individual bottom
lashes to kind of give a little bit of a
doe-eyed
doll kind of looks I just feel like bold
liner and lots of lashes go really well
together if you have naturally long
lower lashes don't feel like you need to
do this step you can definitely just put
a lot of mascara on but as we can see I
got a little deviation so I'm going to
go ahead and apply those really quickly
so as you guys can see I cut a little
section I'm just going to apply it
around the same area that I applied the
other one here I'm taking the second
piece this is the second longest piece
from the lashes and just pop it on the
very outer corner I love saying that off
it pop it pop it like it's a very normal
thing to say so that's everything for
the eye look now we're just going to
move on to finishing the face I already
have applied powder and my foundation so
I'm just gonna go in with a highlighter
now to really give that glow and this is
by well people it's a cream highlight so
what I like to do with this is apply it
to my Cupid's bow tipping your nose and
blend it with your finger just to give a
little glow and then I'm gonna go in
with this bronzer this is the bio
bronzer powder natural tan bye welcome I
already have like a darker setting
powder in this area I always apply a
darker sitting powder but now I'm going
to go in with a bronzer to kind of warm
the whole look up a bit more yes we want
to look tan also going to take that
bronzer along the hairline as well give
it to me you could also take a little
bit of bronzer over the nose for like up
and I'm just getting in the Sun kind of
look my nose slightly sunburned but
mostly tan I've been applying a bronzer
for like a good 10 minutes right now I'm
just bronzing up my face I forgot to
apply a little bit of highlighter to the
tops of my cheekbones with that cream
highlight I'm just going to go back
and lightly apply that did I forget that
for the blush I'm going to keep it very
subtle just because you don't want to
have a blush competing with the blue
liner so I'm going to go into this
palette this is the book of beauty by
pixie I'm going to take this pinky blush
right here I'm just going to go ahead
and apply that to the cheeks check this
and I like to pop it on the apples I
feel like you can apply your blush on
the apples of the cheeks or you can also
sweep it more in this area but for a
fresh glowy like more doll like look I
don't know why I'm going for a doll like
look but I like to pop it on these
little apples final step to the look is
going to be the lips and I really want
to keep the focus on the eyes like I've
said but I will say that another way to
wear this look would be with a bright
bold red lip if you're feeling it's
troubled
I'm only feeling medium bold on the
scale of bold I'm gonna go with a
neutral lip because I just really want
the eyes to be the star so going in with
this soft nude lip pencil I'm going to
go ahead and line the lips soft nude it
would exactly like my lip color and so
I'm gonna have to change that just
kidding
alright so I'm gonna go in with bare
buff keeping the lips a little bit more
natural for this look is very fresh and
modern and it's not too overdone and
obviously you guys know I love nude lips
oh and now I'm gonna go in with the
Burt's Bees lipstick and this is in
niall nude
all right and that's the finished look
super easy super clean skin fresh more
natural lip color and then a really bold
statement with the eyes I really hope
