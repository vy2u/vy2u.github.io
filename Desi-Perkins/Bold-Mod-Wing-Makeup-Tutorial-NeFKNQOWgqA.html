been so long since I have filmed a
tutorial it feels so weird to be talking
to camera I was like a little bit off
more than usual but it's only because
I've been on vacation if you guys
haven't yet seen my video of Turks and
Caicos Stephen and I started a new
channel I'll link it down below if you
guys want to check that out we were in
Turks and Caicos so I've been gone for a
while and now I'm back and I feel like
I'm reenergized and ready to film a
bunch of new tutorials for you guys I'm
excited for all the holiday looks coming
up that I have brewing in my mind this
is not one of them this is actually a
look that you guys really wanted to see
it's nothing super new or creative it's
just a very very bold mod like eyeliner
oh my god I just saw my my chicken claws
in the monitor like yeah it's a very
very bold mod looking eyeliner and I
really really like the way it lifts the
eyes so you guys requested it and I
thought it would be a really good
tutorial before all the holiday looks if
you guys are interested then keep on
watching so for this video I'm going to
be using everything that came in it sea
glam bag this month first thing that's
in here is the josie maran argan oil and
this is a different formula it's light I
think this one's more for acne prone
skin and it's good for moisturizing it's
like a light a little white oil I like
to just Pat things on my face feel like
it works better the next thing I want to
do is modify my face using a primer this
one is by fig and brush this is the
mattifying emulsion and pore refiner I'm
gonna go ahead and pry my eyelids I'm
gonna move on to my eyes because we're
gonna be using some black eyeshadow and
I don't want the black to fall out all
over my foundation so I'm just gonna
quickly pry my lids with this this is
the Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and I'm
using a zoeva buffing brush
so today I'm gonna be using the new a
tartlet palette this is the in the bloom
the eyeshadow look that I will be doing
is gonna be super simple because this
looks gonna be all about the old liner
look so I'm just gonna go into this
color called smarty pants it's a nice
little topi peachy peachy nude I'm gonna
pack that all over my lid so after I do
that I'm taking a blending brush and I'm
just gonna buff out the edges so that
it's nice and blended looking this eye
is like so small today my eyelid it's so
small so the next thing I'm gonna do is
take gesture which is right here it's
very taupe taupe shape and I'm taking
that on a Smith 2 4 7 I love these
brushes they're really good I'm gonna
take this and define my crease just
lightly
so you just want to give a really soft
shadow in your crease so now that we
have the crease color I'm just gonna
highlight the brow bone a little bit
more using charmer this you can't really
see but it's basically like a bone bone
white color like a cream taking a detail
shooter brush from zoeva and just
popping that under the brow bone okay so
now it is time for the liner I did this
line I get to be on snapchat and you
guys all really liked it it's just gonna
be a connecting liner from the top to
the lower lash line maybe it'll give me
an eye lift preferably on this side I'm
gonna use a black eyeshadow I'm using
the one by from the Evelyn Lozada lazada
so bad that palette it's just a black
eyeshadow any black eyeshadow will do so
I'm gonna pick up that on an angled
brush start in the middle here but I
guess you could give yourself like a
little guideline because you really want
this bottom part and this wing to
connect so I'm just gonna lightly it's
totally fine because I don't bring my
concealer up this high anyways tilt your
head back so that your wing comes out
straight and lightly draw out that line
and of course bring it back so since
we're doing it with eye shadow you can
pretty much make mistakes and just blend
them out so it'll be fine
so we're gonna bring this all the way
into the inner corner it's gonna keep
building that up until you get the shape
okay so after we've mapped out
everything with eye shadow I'm taking my
Inglot gel liner here fine the wing
especially like spots in the inner
corners there I'm using a beauty basics
liner brush to do this after we're done
with that we're going to take a makeup
remover wipe and clean up the under eye
moving on a foundation I'll be using the
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation
so next I'm going with my concealer I'll
be using the NARS creamy concealer in
custard I really like this color I mean
this isn't custard this is ginger still
like to use custard more as a highlight
but ginger is good for just like a more
natural concealer look blonde it out I'm
also going to use the ginger concealer
to highlight because now my under eyes
are pretty bright so you want to balance
out the rest of your face with all the
other high points so here heal a little
on the tip of the nose
and to set it i'll be using the laura
mercier translucent powder this is
actually the pressed translucent powder
set that with the translucent powder
so before I set the rest of my face I'm
gonna apply a cream highlight to the
tops of my cheekbones this one is by
model ko this is the champagne peach
Bellini and bronze shimmer I want to use
my finger but my nails too long to like
really get in there actually I wanna get
in there what I like to do with cream of
eyeliners is point towards any light
source in your house like wherever
there's light right here you know go
like this and wherever you see your
cheekbones popping that's where you want
to apply the highlight the finger that
has the most product I dab it on first
on the highest point then I take a clean
finger and I blend it in because I don't
want to go crazy with the product
everywhere for my highlight I'll be
using the Laura Geller gilded honey
highlighter and to apply the highlighter
I'm gonna be using this brush it's by SL
miss glam and it is a blusher brush
synthetic so it's gonna pick up the
highlight okay well I'm just gonna go
right over the cream highlight this is
gonna intensify it
I cleaned off the brush and I'm also
gonna use it to set the rest of my face
this is the Mack shear select cover
powder anywhere like our on the chin
around the nose just where I would get
oily going into Mac give me Sun bronzer
of course taking this on a Mac 168 brush
and I'm gonna apply it to the contours
of my face to enhance the lower lash
line I'm going to be using the skinny
and long eye pencil by Jake apt and I'm
gonna be applying this on the outer
lower half of the waterline connecting
it to the top so I'm applying this
pretty much as a base first cuz we're
gonna go over it with black eyeshadow
it's good to have an eyeliner base when
you're doing black eyeshadow because
it's gonna have something to cling to
and you're gonna have less fallout dot
it on don't rub it
so as you get closer to the inner corner
just taper it off next I'm going in with
Smashbox full exposure mascara we're
gonna go in with some bomb-ass mascara
all right for false lashes I'll be using
House of lashes Fame fatale okay boys
that was my lash we using House of
lashes glue and they have it in black
which I like when I have a liner on in
my Ipsy glam bag I also got this beauty
basics gel liner and it comes with a
brush and this is in the shade navy blue
actually did not do anything with blue
so I couldn't use it with my makeup look
but I wanted to show you guys a swatch
of it anyway to highlight my Cupid's bow
I will be using the beady basics chubby
eyeshadow pencil and this isn't a shade
Sahara gold also like my Cupid's bow
area final touches we have to do lips
and blush I'm gonna do blush laughs
because I want to see how the lips
balance out I have two colors here so
I'm gonna try this nude shade by trusty
this is in nantucket nude I feel like it
goes with the eye color
if you want super nude lips I feel like
this look is really mod with the really
really nude lip I'm gonna go and try
this color pop shader this is a new
color pop liquid lipstick in the shade
plant this is more peachy which I like I
don't know how to use a big mirror
parent link I blocked the camera every
circuit ooh I love this color
ooh I think I'm gonna use this blush I
got this new blush from car glow I can't
open it here we go actually never tried
their blushes I don't think come on
perfect perfect
so this blush is in the shade of it Los
Cabos
okay so this is the final makeup look
the eyeliner is pretty much the star of
the show it has like a mod vibe really
hope that you guys liked it don't forget
to give this video a thumbs up if you
did see you guys in the next video bye I
forgot to contour my nose
Who am I without a nose Thunder does
know I'm not gonna do it anymore I've
already I've already gone too far
I'm upset I feel like Jeff's looking at
me like he's really confused we're gonna
have a talk go off listen we do we fry
the tortillas okay I'm pretty good at
Rocco's just saying just Katy texting me
okay to text me
