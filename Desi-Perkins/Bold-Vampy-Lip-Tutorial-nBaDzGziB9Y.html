break it's been a little over a week
since I've uploaded a video I think
since actually Halloween day so um yeah
I just took a break I made a huge mess
in my studio and I literally think I
needed a week to clean all the brushes
like it took forever and finally
everything's back to normal
and I have time to film videos and I'm
really excited about all the ideas that
I'm thinking about doing but yeah leave
any of your requests down below and if
you have any celebrity inspired looks
you would like me to recreate just tweet
me pictures at desi Perkins and our
hashtag does he makeup as well
I always check the hashtag and I love
seeing your guys's recreations and
anyways onto the look so I just did this
bold lip I know it's not for everyone
not everyone would think this is
wearable but I definitely would wear it
I love a bold lip and it's super in
trend right now all the celebrities are
wearing it and I think it's so much fun
and it's just different and you know
when people think of a bold lip it's
more of like a red or bright pink but
this is just so much fun and yeah I
really like it
it's a since it's such a statement piece
I kept the eyes some way neutral and
with a winged liner and just some
beautiful eyelashes so if you guys like
this look and you would like to see how
to recreate it keep on watching I'm
gonna start off by applying Mac strobe
cream to the high points of my face to
give that luminous effect taking my
armani luminous self foundation and my
glamour princess sponge
and I'm gonna go ahead and place all of
the foundation where I want it with my
fingers and then take my damp sponge
which I use the fix+ to dampen it and
I'm just gonna push the product into my
skin to give me that flawless airbrushed
finish and
yeah so I apologize if I look puffy I
just had a massage and it probably
wasn't the best time to film but oh well
so on to the eyebrows I'm brushing
through with a spooly and then as you
guys can see here in this area
I seriously grow no hair it's really sad
but um it's okay
I'm gonna use my brow bar by whitening
lightening and I'm gonna start off by
using the dark color and then a little
bit of the lighter color in the front of
the brow going in with my Mac 263 brush
I'm going to just feather the dark color
in first and try to make it look like
hair strokes so very light pressure here
I love how you guys always say you love
my brows but in reality I have to work
really hard at them and you know you
can't have everything that doesn't make
up scores so thank God now I'm going in
with a dip down and this is a gel liner
and I barely put any on my brush and I'm
just outlining at the bottom of my brow
and then where I have sparse hairs here
it really helps because the gel lets me
mimic hairs more and it's a little bit
darker now I'm taking my eco brow gel
and this has a slight tint to it and I
love it
it actually makes see how it's making it
look more natural beautiful look at the
comparison now I know it's crazy
thank God now I'm taking painterly
paint-pot by Mac and this is an
eyeshadow base and I'm using an F 75
Sigma brush to carve out my brow and
then bring that base down to the lid and
then blending it out with my finger then
I'm going to take a Mac 239 brush and
this cream color from the lorac Pro
palette and apply that to my brow bone
as a highlight then take the taupe color
and map 2 to 4 blending brush and just
give yourself a slight definition in the
crease
taking this mob shade and my Sigma
blending brush I'm just gonna pop that
into the crease to add more depth but
not too much we're gonna keep the eyes
super simple then I'm gonna go back in
with that cream color once again and
pack it on to the lids I like to do the
step in second because I get to have
more true color and I'm not blending
away at it now for the liner this is
makeup eeks black gel liner and immortal
and then I'm gonna use that same brush I
used for my eyebrows and start to wing
the liner making it super thin in the
inner corner and then thicker as I go
out
now it's time to apply our lashes and
just put those on with tweezers
now I'm making my tart creaseless
concealer with my mac prolongwear
concealer and i'm applying that
generously because I look so puffy from
my mister hush and then I'm using this
Sigma brush it's the p8 and it's amazing
I love it perfect for concealer then
take a powder to set your under eyes
with and I'm using a sigma of 64 brush
to do that and just to keep everything
from sliding around I'm using that same
brush with mix deep tan bronzer to
really outline my cheekbones just to
give that her size line and then I'm
going to use this brush which is a Mac
109 just to blend it out so it's not
harsh taking my NARS palette and the
color sin it's like a Mavi pink color
I'm using the same Mac brush to apply
that to my cheeks
now take your sadly broken soft and
gentle highlighter and apply that to the
top of your cheekbones down the bridge
of your nose and then I also like to put
it on my Cupid's bow using my ICO black
mascara and just putting that all over
my lashes so that they blend with my
fake lashes
I'm gonna then outline the bottom of my
eye with the color sable and then
highlight the inner tear ducts with a
white shadow and now I'm gonna take this
Milani lipstick in the colour sangria
and just kind of apply it all over my
lips as a base now I love this color on
its own but I want a darker color so
here I'm taking knight moth by Mac and
just really filling in my lips with it
now just clean it up with a concealer
and you're done
hope you guys enjoyed the look and I'll
see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
