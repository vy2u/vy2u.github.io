today's video is gonna be on this really
simple but bold makeup look I was
watching amra my friend or my Z as you
guys may know her on snapchat and she
was wearing just a fierce wing and a
bright red lip and it was so stunning
that's one of my favorite looks that she
does I've always loved it when she does
that so it inspired me to make a video
just doing the same thing basically I
was inspired by her now that I finished
it kind of reminds me of Selena a little
bit also which I love love so if you
guys are interested in this makeup look
then keep on watching first I'm going in
with foundation it's the maybelline
superstay better skin I'm using the
shade rich tan and I'm going to stipple
this on using a Beauty Blender this
foundation has a satin finish it's kind
of comparable to the finish of the Make
Up For Ever foundation the HD I'm not
going to be wearing eyeshadow today so I
know I know
so this look is pretty simple so I'm
gonna run the foundation over my lids as
well just to get rid of the redness I
look kind of bald huh we're gonna move
on to concealer I've been mixing these
two concealers here this is the Dior
skin star concealer in the shade
0:03 and this is the age rewind
concealer in light pale so I mixed them
because this one neutralizes under-eye
darkness for me and thanks Katie for
ruining my video this one brightens so
when I mix them together it's like match
made in heaven so I'm first going to
apply this one
I'll just put most of the product where
I have the darker circular circular the
darker areas of my eyes there's no I use
this for like that Kim K highlight
that's you know been overdone
and then I'm going to blend that out
with my blender
you know I'm facing straight to camera
for you guys I'm trying because I know
you guys always want me to do that it's
so hard for me mostly because I hold a
mirror over here so if I hold it here
like in your face so like to take the
rounder side of the Beautyblender where
the one we use the foundation with kind
of go over the edges that concealer to
blend it so there's not just like a
stark line of concealer there so I'm
going to be setting my under eyes using
the Laura Mercier translucent powder and
this is my favorite brush at the moment
for the under eye area it's the
japonesque 915 brush dust over the under
eye area with this brush just because
it's so soft it's perfect I'm also going
to dust this over my eyelids because we
put that foundation there strobing kit
look at that from colour-pop cosmetics
actually I had dinner with them the
other day and they gave me the two kits
there's one for light skin tones and
there's one for dark skin tones I'm
going to use the one from light to
medium today let me open it for you guys
this is what the light to medium one
looks like so you have like a really
gold highlighter more of a white
highlight and then a blush color and
there's also some lippie stix in here as
well so i'm going to be mixing the
lighter and the Golder one together this
one is parasol and this one is called
fanny pack
I like to take this brush afterwards and
kind of buff over my highlighter just so
it smooths out the edges a little bit it
just gave a really subtle glow of course
you can add more or less if you want
next I'm using my Mac's give me Sun
bronzer of course my fave and my Mac
brush this is the 135 I have been loving
this brush for the bronzer just because
it is really fluffy but it's also pretty
thin for a large powder brush so you can
really get into the cheekbones with it
and also just blend all over the face
with it as well gotta get my contour
face on
and then you guys know of course I've
check it around the hairline as well
next I'm picking up max gold deposit and
with the same brush I'm going to lightly
apply that over where we applied the
bronzer this is just giving off like a
really really light layer of gold
shimmer so it looks very glowy then of
course I'm going to apply my blush this
is by japonesque and it's in the shade
Velvet Touch I'm using the same brush
because brush just works for everything
okay so my audio cut out right about
here so I'm just going to voice-over
this part don't mind if my lips don't
match what I'm saying I'm taking the Mac
210 brush in my Inglot gel liner so I
really like this liner brush because
it's thin and it gets in between the
lashes you want to make sure you coat
all the surface space between the lid
and the lashes here because you don't
want to have any gaps and you could also
tight line for that as well then I'm
going to take the zoeva angled brush
this is a perfect eyeliner brush because
it already has the shape of the wing I
like to create the wing with this brush
see how it has that slant it's just
going to do the work for you and I'll
show you right here so taking that slant
we're just going to create a line from
the end of the lash line to the tail of
the brow it pretty much just does it for
you then you want to flip the brush
around and go back down to the lash line
creating a triangle boom did you see
that I swear an angled brush will help
you in this wing process if you have not
tried that yet then of course you just
want to fill in the gaps with the gel
liner now that I've applied my eyeliner
we're just going to go in with some
mascara this is by Tarte cosmetics it is
the lights camera lashes mascara
Palacios I'm going to be using today are
these ones right here there by Koko
lashes and they're called queen bee
compliments of Katy they're pretty long
but fluttery that is the lashes on their
super like doe-eyed type of lashes I'm
now going to finish off the look with my
lips this is cherry lip liner by Mac
it's one of my favorite red lip liners
oh sorry
right on top of that I'm going to be
applying honest hacia liquid lipstick
and Sarah fine okay I'm pretty sure I
pronounced that wrong I think it's
Seraphin Seraphin I hope so Seraphin I
don't think it's Sarah fine I think I
pronounced that way wrong that is the
last step of the makeup look pretty
simple it still has a lot of vision so
that's it for the makeup tutorial I
really hope that you guys enjoyed this I
love this look it's so simplistic yet so
bold so let me know what you guys
thought of it in the comments down below

tutorial bye
