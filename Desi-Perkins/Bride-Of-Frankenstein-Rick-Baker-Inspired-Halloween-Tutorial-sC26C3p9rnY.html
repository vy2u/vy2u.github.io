hey everyone welcome back to my channel
so for today's Halloween look I decided
to recreate this Bride of Frankenstein
and this is actually really inspired by
Kevin Baker who's an amazing artist that
I will link down below the book that
said let's go ahead and get started I'm
going to start off by applying a light
foundation this is in the shade
porcelain and it's bare minerals bare
skin foundation and I'm just buffing it
with the brush that is especially made
for this foundation and then I'm going
to actually add a little bit of white
into the mix just to make my skin even
paler and this is just from my makeup
forever flash palette I'm going to apply
that pretty much anywhere that my skin
is showing and I'm going to set that
with a powder I'm using my Monica dark
powder and c2 but you guys could use a
translucent powder if you don't have
that now I'm going to cover the ends of
my brows if you have thicker brow so you
may want to use a glue stick and there's
plenty of tutorials online for that and
I'm going into this LA Colors eyebrow a
trio and I'm taking the darkest shade
which is kind of a black charcoal e
color and I'm going to start to fill in
the brows and instead of going in the
actual shape of my brow bone I'm gonna
take that brow straight up and towards
the temple and give myself a spock-like
brow all of our shadows are going to be
very angular so we want to keep
everything going that direction now I'm
just applying a Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
and then I'm going to set that with a
white eyeshadow and that's going to
serve as our base so now I'm picking up
a light brown eyeshadow and I'm sort of
mapping out where I want my cut crease
to be and this is also going to serve as
our transition shade and as you can see
I'm taking it all the way back to the
temple now I'm taking this color by
Anastacio Beverly Hills in deep brown
and I'm further deepening that cut
crease and blending the color upwards
so for the last shade in the crease I'm
just picking up a black eye shadow this
is LBD by Anasazi of Beverly Hills and
as you guys can see I'm using a tiny
little brush to kind of outline the cut
crease first and then I'm just going to
kind of move the product around with the
blending brush and sweep it upwards so
that it has a really nice gradient into
the dark brown and then into the light
brown now I didn't want to go too crazy
and paint my whole face green but to
incorporate a little bit of green I'm
actually taking this shadow by morphe
and I'm applying it in my inner under
brow I don't know what I would call that
and my temple you guys can see what I'm
doing and then I'm packing on Mac the
long type which is kind of a white matte
eyeshadow and I'm just going to pack
that onto my lid now it's time to create
a pretty fierce wing I'm taking my Sigma
gel liner in wicked and a zoeva angled
brush to create this and I found by
using this brush it made it actually
really easy but um yeah I'm just
building a wing here and then to make it
darker I'm using NYC liquid liner just
to go over that next you want to apply
some false lashes and surprise-surprise
I'm using hosta blush as iconic you guys
know these are my jam I pretty much use
them all the time
I'm sorry
lastly for the eyes you want to take a
black liner and go ahead and line your
waterline and kind of bring it down
pretty far on the outer edge of the
bottom lash line and then go ahead and
blend it out with a pencil brush now
it's time to hollow out our cheekbones
and I'm using a contour shade from
honest Asti of Beverly Hills and looking
back this video green eyeshadow would
have looked really nice as the contour
so if you guys want to do that instead I
think it would look really nice and I'm
going to apply a quick quote quote quick
coat of Eiko mascara to my lashes for
the lips I'm just going to be using mac
cosmetics night moth lip liner and I'm
gonna give my lips the shape that I want
first and just use the same exact pencil
to fill them in I'm also going to be
using this pencil to create the stitches
on my face so that's a big reason why I
like this look you just need makeup you
don't need any crazy special effects
things to create this look you'll see in
a second how easy it is so first you
want to map out where you want your
stitches to be and as you can see I'm
using a really light hand just in case I
mess up and then once you get the shape
you're going to go back with the pencil
and really deepen those lines up
so now after we've done that I'm going
to lightly take the pencil and draw a
line on each side of the stitches so one
on one side one on the other side and
just leaving a little bit of space in
between those three lines all together
and I'm going to take a pencil brush and
just start blending out those lines and
I'm not blending out the actual stitch
that we drew first just the lines that
we just drew on the sides of the stitch
by doing this it's going to make your
stitches look three-dimensional and real
to add a few highlights to the stitches
I'm using my makeup forever white from
the flash palette and you guys can use a
white eyeliner for this but I'm just
highlighting around the stitch to make
the stitch look deeper because white is
going to bring the outside of the stitch
forward going back with the night mouth
lip pencil I'm just going to do the
opposing stitches here and you guys can
make these any direction you want I'm
making an X here and then on the end of
these stitches I'm doing little dots so
that they look more like stitches and
that is your scar pretty much done you
can go ahead and take your pencil brush
and blend any edges if you need to so a
lot of you guys asked about my top on
Instagram and it's really funny because
I'm actually just wearing a corset
halter top but I found this fabric at a
Halloween shop I think they use it to
decorate bushes or tablecloths and I
wrapped it in the straps so for the
bolts of my neck I found these lotions
that have the perfect little caps that
look kind of like bolts i spray-painted
them silver or you could use silver nail
polish and I attached them to my neck
with a glue called pros-aide and a
similar glue would be spirit gum which
they sell at Halloween stores but I
think pros-aide works better and
originally I was going to use toothpaste
caps for the bolt so try to find any
caps around your house that may work and
they should look something like this
then I popped on some yellow contacts
which I got from a local Halloween store
and for the wig crispy and I actually
made it from a regular black wig that I
had and we just stuffed it with some
foam clipped in some white extensions to
the sides and teased it
like crazy and that is it for this
tutorial I hope you guys enjoyed the
video give it a thumbs up if you did and
I'll see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
