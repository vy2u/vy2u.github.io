today I wanted to do a look for you guys
that was super bronzy and perfect for
summer night so let's get started I'm
gonna start by applying this taupe shade
in the color toasted by via bombshell
all over the lid and just packing it on
with a flat brush
then after we have our face down we're
gonna want to warm up the crease so I'm
gonna take this color called rock bottom
it's a really pretty cranberry coppery
shade and I'm just gonna apply this into
the crease and I'm just applying this
with a blending brush in soft windshield
wiper motions into the crease for a
really nice haze around the eye and
after we've added that warmth if you
want to add definition so pick up a
matte brown eyeshadow and pack that on
to the outer corner of your eye in the
shape of a V don't worry too much about
it being perfect because now we're gonna
use a blending brush and really smooth
out those edges after blending if you
feel like you've lost a little bit of
the intensity of the dark brown eye
shadow it's okay just go ahead and pack
on a little bit more and you could
always keep blending afterwards
I want to keep this look really soft and
sultry so instead of using a liquid
liner I'm gonna go in with a black kohl
liner and I'm just gonna apply it really
close to the lashes and this application
doesn't have to be perfect because I'm
gonna take a pencil brush and I'm gonna
smooth out those edges
if you guys aren't big false eyelash
wearers it's okay go ahead and apply
some mascara however I love the dramas
so I'm gonna apply a pair of falsies
before finishing off the eye look I'm
gonna apply concealer and the reason I
do this is because if I know I'm going
to be blending any eye shadow on the
lower lash line I don't want to create a
harsh edge if I apply my concealer
afterwards so by doing this first you're
gonna have a really smooth transition
from your eye shadow to your concealer
now I'm just gonna take a highlighter
and apply that in the tear duct just to
open up our eyes a bit
picking up the sheet in southern sauce
I'm gonna take a pencil brush and apply
that to the lower lash line
going back in with the coal liner I'm
gonna just line my waterline and then
take a blending brush and the dark brown
shadow and really just smoke out the
lower lash line and really blend the
colors together now I'm going to take a
bronzer that has really warm undertones
and I'm just going to contour my face
with this but I'm not gonna give too
much of a harsh contour I almost just
want to tan up my skin and make it look
sunkissed keeping with the warm tones
I'm taking this blush in tanorexic and
I'm gonna apply this to the apples of
the cheeks pulling it up to my temple
and sometimes I like to put a little bit
on my nose just to give it that straight
from the Sun look I'm just gonna pick up
a highlighter and apply that to my nose
and my Cupid's bow and I just do this
with my finger because it's quicker and
it gets into those little small areas
and then I'm going to apply a
highlighter on the high points of my
cheekbones as well
for the lips I'm gonna apply a nude
lipstick first is to neutralize the lip
color and then I'm going to apply this
really pretty coral shade lip gloss in
the color 7/11 to the top of that just
to give them that perfect summer lip
color and that completes the look if you

forever in my mind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
