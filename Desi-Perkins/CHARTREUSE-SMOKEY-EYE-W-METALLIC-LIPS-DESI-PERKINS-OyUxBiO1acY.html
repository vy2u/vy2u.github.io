today's video is gonna be a make up toot
on this look right here I wanted to play
around with metallic lips because I see
other people wearing them they look so
good I know it's a little bit different
so if you wanted to switch the slip out
you definitely could with something else
but I was like I'm doing a mashaallah
clip today for the eye look I knew I
wanted to use this makeup geek eyeshadow
because it's pop in its a lime light and
so I practically based this look around
this and focus a lot on the skin and
this makeup tutorial so if you're
interested then keep on watching
already I'm still marinating in my my
face mask this is the aqua ringer
treatment mask
it helps stress skin and it gives you
some hydration that's usually why I like
sheet masks because they're like
hydrating you can use as many as you
want so today I'm going to be trying out
this eye cream travel therapy
reconstructing a truffle eye contour
this came in this month's empty glam bag
this is going to hydrate and deep puff
the under eyes so we're also going to
hydrate our lips with some chapstick
this is the lasting smiles organic lip
balm it's in the scent peach blossom
next I'm gonna use the benefit
Porefessional primer I'm just gonna Pat
it in to where I have pores which is
right here for me and then I also like
to bring it under the eyes to smooth out
you know any fine lines and I like to
Pat in the primers to like really pack
it into my pores fill them up so I'm
gonna switch things up today I'm gonna
start off with my foundation usually I
like to do my eyebrows first but I'm
just gonna go switch it up so you guys
don't know what to expect because I
don't want to be you know predictable
I'm using a new foundation this is the
LA girl Pro coverage HD this is kind of
going to be my first impression on it
too because I've never used it before la
girl makes really good affordable makeup
products they do make these Pro
concealers which are amazing for
contouring I love these for contouring I
think this is new I just got it and I'm
not even sure if this is my color but
I'm gonna try it out it's warm beige
picking that up with my Beauty Blender
I'm just gonna start stippling it on
that covered really well off the bat
it's good it's good
under the color is actually pretty good
I just started filling in my brows this
is the goof proof by benefit I'm just
gonna lightly run this through and give
my brows some shape I want it to like do
my whole face makeup before my brows but
honestly I couldn't I looked like an
alien so we're moving on to give like a
more natural looking brow in the front
here I'm taking this brow pencil by
Scone cosmetics and I'm gonna flick
upwards to kind of make like hair like
strokes this is the brow wand eye pencil
in the shade chocolate chocolate I'm
gonna be moving on to my concealer I'll
be using the tarte cosmetics shaped
shaped concealer in tan I'm just gonna
use my Beauty Blender to blend that out
that actually looks like amazing
incredible I'm also going to use this
down the bridge of my nose and on my
forehead hello I love this applicator of
this concealer it's like the best
applicator now I'm going to go into my
Bobbi Brown foundation stick and this is
in the shade almond I'm going to use
this to contour and warm up my face this
video is very much focusing on the skin
so there's going to be a lot of time
spent on the skin today so I'm just
going to go ahead and blend that out
with my Beauty Blender because I want to
be bronzed
I love this foundation stick I've been
using it since forever to contour and
bronze I don't really like it as like an
all-over foundation but I love it as a
contour so next I'm going to go ahead
and did my Beauty Blender into my Laura
Mercier translucent powder and set the
under eyes we're going to start right
here on the side of the nose and just
bring it in
I'm gonna take a little bit of that on a
flat brush and also highlight a thin
line down the bridge of my nose this is
gonna make your nose look thinner and
also give it like a contour and
highlight I'm also going to bring it
right here between the brows run that
powder right underneath the contour as
well but very lightly to kind of chisel
out the contour that we created here on
our cheek when I apply that under the
cheeks I don't leave it like how I do
the rest I just wipe it right away
because I don't want it to be too harsh
all right now to set the rest of my face
I've been loving the lemare this is the
powder that's what it says it's just a
translucent powder but it's not as white
as like the Laura Mercier powder it has
like a slight shimmer to it when you
look at it at first but it's not
actually that shimmery on the face it
just kind of gives you a nice overall
luminous look and I'm just gonna go
ahead and set my face with this Patrick
tall recommend this to me a long time
ago and this is what he uses on all his
clients so I'm like I need it as well
this is just a little sponge that comes
with it
now we're gonna bronze the skin even
further I'm going in with the Becca
multitasking perfecting powder and this
is in warm honey it is actually my first
time using this product as well
so I'm just going to kind of set that
cream contour that we did every where we
applied the cream contour you're gonna
apply this and the reason I'm applying
the cream contour underneath and the
powder contour is because I want a
really overall bronzy look powder
contour can give you that just as easy
but sometimes it'll fade away and I want
it to like really stay when you put
something underneath and then set it
it's gonna stay a lot longer and you're
gonna look a lot bronzer so it's not
always necessary but when I know I want
to be like over-the-top
bronzed which is what I want
this makeup tutorial I'm gonna do that
now to highlight the forehead area
because we want light under our eyes but
you also want the center before had to
be light and the chin I'm taking the
Ofra cosmetics banana powder and this is
in a BH a 22 brush and I'm just going to
place this right here so it just seems
like almost like there's light hitting
this part of your forehead I know it's a
lot of makeup right now but sometimes
it's just so fun to just keep putting it
on man today when I was deciding what
makeup look to do I'm always like in my
head like oh man I have to do something
different and sometimes I just want to
sit in front of the camera and do my
makeup like as if I was not filming at
all and do whatever I want and I feel
like my makeup comes out better that way
so that's what I'm doing I'm just going
in right now I'm gonna let that stuff
under my eyes bake for a hot minute
we're gonna keep on putting makeup on
the face I'm not done yet
not even close now I'm going in with the
cover effects candlelight and this is
just like a shimmery bronze and I'm
gonna use this Sephora brush
feather-light weight it does 93 on it
but we're just gonna lightly put this
over all of the bronze areas of our face
right here and I'm kinda gonna dust away
any powder that I have here but leave
the rest of it baking under my eyes
actually I'm gonna I'm gonna also just
away the powder down my nose next I'll
be going into the Tarte Pro glow palette
I'm gonna take the highlight lit and
this is beauty junkie Pro highlighter
brush I'm just gonna go ahead and apply
that on the high points of the face oh
gosh yes now I'm going to take the
artist Couture gold digger highlight and
I'm going to use this for the tip of my
nose the owner of this company which is
angel and Kayne Mac daddy if you guys
follow him he did my makeup the other
night and he used this hot he used this
highlight and I was like beaming so
after I apply highlight on the tip of my
nose I like to take my finger and kind
of push it into the skin so it's not too
crazy I'm also gonna put it on the queue
though I'm going to take a little bit of
that highlight and put it just on the
very high points of my cheekbones after
we're done with all our makeup when you
spray everything like with a setting
spray it's gonna just not look as
powdery it's gonna look nice and moist
so now I'm gonna move on to my eyes I'm
using the soft ochre Paint Pot as a base
and I'm gonna apply that with the morphe
r32 I'm barely gonna put that on because
I don't want too much eye shadow base
I'm gonna start at the lid and then up
to the crease so I'm just barely
applying this just to get something down
I'm going to go ahead and set that base
with that same Oprah cosmetics banana
powder I'm going to go into the urban
decay full spectrum palette over here
I'm going to take this bright yellow
color and we're going to put that in the
upper crease but you guys didn't expect
that I'm just gonna want to blend that
all up in the upper crease down this
yellow is pigmented I'm a fan this
yellow eyeshadow right now going into
multiples medics unseen and this beauty
junkie blending brush apply that into
the crease but we're just going to put
this a little lower than the yellow
shade start on the outer V area
concentrate the color over here and then
work it into the crease start taking
that in all the way to the inner corner
here I like to keep a nice less dense
brush next to me so that I could blend
away any edges as I go and this doesn't
have any product in it it's just a nice
soft Real Techniques brush I'm just
using it to diffuse the edges then I'm
going to go into the Kat Von D metals
palette and I'm just gonna pick up this
dark brown shade called O whatever you
guys have at home dark brown just pick
that up so I'm gonna take this on a
Smith 247 brush start applying it on the
outer part of my eye
we're gonna create the sandwich effect
put it in the crease but then I'm also
going to pack it on to this part of the
eye and the inner
part of the eye if you have trouble
seeing the shape of your eyes sometimes
when you look down like this into a
little mirror you could see it perfectly
I'm gonna take that on the inner corner
here outer corner inner corner all right
now I'm going into limelight and this is
by makeup geek and I'm using a flat
brush this is an a2 a BH brush so I'm
going to focus it on the center like
right where your pupil is just going to
lightly start patting outwards and
upwards I'm just going to feather out
the edges here and then go in again on
top of it I'm going to add juicy apple
and this is a color pop shadow it's part
of the Hello Kitty collection so it
looks like this but when you put it on
it just gives off like really pretty
gold reflex right there in the center
okay I'm gonna start working on my lower
lash line I'm gonna go back into the
yellow eyeshadow basically everything we
put in the crease I'm gonna just run it
on my lower lash line now smoke it out
picking up the morphe m51 9 and that
yellow eyeshadow and I'm gonna start
running it on the lower lash line I'm
going in with a pencil brush make it a
little bit less blown out I also think
now's a good time to dust away that bake
I know I'm jumping around a little bit
but I forgot that I still had it sitting
there so for some reason my sound cut
out right about here so I'm going to do
a voiceover for the next minute I'm just
taking the same color we put in the
crease the dark brown and I'm gonna run
that on my lower lash line just like I
said just basically mimicking the crease
but on the lower lash line
deepening up that outer corner and then
just keep a clean blending brush nearby
to blend the edges now I'm going into a
flatter brush and the darker Brown and
I'm just gonna place that right under my
waterline on the outer corner and also
on the inner corner going back into that
bright green shade I'm gonna place that
on the lower lash line right under the
green and that we put on the lid boom
pappan I don't know what I was saying
here I'm very curious mmm I think I was
debating whether I like the green at the
bottom it's hard to say I'm gonna take
the artists Couture diamond glow powder
in sugar-daddy
I believe is it called sugar daddy I
think so correction it's called gold
digger but I was close then you want to
take any brown liner and just line the
waterline in the gaps where you have the
dark on the inner and outer corner to
add a little volume and darkness to our
lashes I'm using my Too Faced better
than sex mascara and just giving a light
layer of this before our falsies and
these are of course my house of lashes
ikonics okay for blush I've been loving
this blush lately it's the Oprah blush
and raisin it's super pigmented so you
have to be really careful I'm using this
duo fiber brush because duo fiber tends
to put product on a little bit lighter
for me so this is the luxe II 5 to 4
lightly sweep it across the cheeks the
reason I like this blush is because when
you're doing a look that's more bronzy
it has warm bronzy undertones so it
keeps with that like bronze look now
it's time for lips and I'm not sure what
super lips and I wanted to do something
bronzy but I don't know if I'm gonna
look like really crazy because this
makeup looks already pretty like crazy
this is the Kylie cosmetics Lorde
lipstick this is the lip if you guys
aren't into this lip because I know it's
like really out there it's really
different for some people you can go
ahead and opt for a nude lip or I feel
like this look will also look really
good with a deep deep burgundy lip even
with the green and everything I think it
would just look alright guys so that's
it for this makeup tutorial I really
hope that you enjoyed the video let me
know what you guys thought of the look
in the comments down below along with
any other makeup tutorials that you
would like to see it's always kind of
hard to like get back into the groove
after Halloween like I feel like people
feel like oh man
because Halloween is so much fun and
it's so inspiring and then when you go
back to regular makeup tutorials you're
like it's like this moment where you
just feel not as creative
kind of in this like makeup funk like oh
I can't be melting anymore or can I put
me against bug that you guys have
because I'm ready for it and I'll see
you guys my next video bye bye
I feel good I'm like a slug Oh got me
 what I want to do I don't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
