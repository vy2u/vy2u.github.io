today's video is gonna be a makeup
tutorial on the sparkly green eye look I
found this bobbi brown eyeshadow and I
loved it I was so inspired by it this is
one of the looks that I took a poll on
IG you guys voted the other look but I
still wanted to do this look cuz it was
almost 50/50 so class this is what we'll
be doing today let's go ahead and get
started I decided for the crease colors
I'm gonna be using this BH Studio Pro
palette just I wanted to use something a
little bit more affordable the lid
colors are a little bit pricey and I
feel like this is a good crease slep /
transition shade palette here loving the
tones all the right tones for me I've
already prepped my eyelid with some
sharp everytime tart tart tart tart
shape tape concealer and then I just
said it with some translucent powder
you know same thing I do in all my
videos basically I'm not gonna lie to
you guys the crease is pretty similar to
what I do in a lot of videos too but
here we are in the IG picture actually
used uninterrupted in the crease first
I'm gonna use a color in this palette
that's fairly similar uninterupted is a
little bit more mustardy but we're gonna
hit it with that this color I think is
coming back from Mac I know it was like
discontinued so we're taking that in the
crease and the outer V here and then
just buffing it inwards
okay so that's our start so now we're
gonna deepen that up let's see I want
more of a neutrally not as warm Brown so
I'm gonna go ahead and pick up this one
right over here this cool tone Brown so
I'm just gonna take a little flat brush
first I like to apply it here and really
get it on the outer part smoking it out
and then I'm gonna take my blending
brush this is a Smith to 3/5 and I'm
tilting my head back circular motions
here and then bringing it into the
crease I'm just taking a cleaner brush
and buffing all of this together what
can I say I love the rock so much I
would like to meet the rock I know he
has a YouTube channel I feel like we
should collab the rock I think we should
Jumanji that movie was so good oh I
loved it so much it's one of those
movies that I could probably watch like
five hundred times and never get sick of
it I loved it it was so good so I'm just
basically building this up here we're
gonna clean the lid it's very similar to
like the technique I've been doing where
you do the crease and then you clean up
the lid my next makeup tutorial will be
like a more everyday look cuz I know my
looks lately have been a little bit more
over the top so I'm gonna do like more
of my everyday makeup look I'm going
back into the brush with a little bit of
the first shade we laid down the lighter
brown and I'm just going over that
crease taking a little bit of my Tarte
shape tape in medium on a flat concealer
brush and I'm gonna clean up the lid
space here this is a dose of colors
brush I look back at videos I used to do
a cut crease and it was so much harder
than just carving it out this way it
took me forever back then to get like a
really precise clean crease line and now
I'm like wow this is just way easier I
can't wait till you guys see the lid
color I'm about to put on here this
bobbi brown eyeshadow is so beautiful
I'm so happy I picked it up and decided
to try it out
like really impressed by 2018 goal is to
do a video tutorial in Spanish I'm just
putting that here so you guys can hold
me accountable I'm just scared people
will make fun of me I like just grew up
going to Mexico every summer my mom is
from where's the way out of that that's
how I learned Spanish so obviously my
mom talked to me in Spanish and stuff
but mostly when we were back home I feel
like everyone really wanted us to talk
in English I would like to say I speak
fluent Spanish but it's getting a lot of
little rusty and also there's so many
words that I've never said before in my
life so the way I learned Spanish is
when I went there in the summer I just
picked it up and whatever words I heard
and picked up then that's like what I've
learned and I could hold a fluent
conversation in Spanish and everything
but there's certain words like make up
terminology that I'm like I don't know
how to say that I watch tutorials in
Spanish to like get better at it but
yeah it's just like I get nervous that
people want me clone of me my Spanish
bit aways little medio where's that old
me they always Daniel oh my god marki
here we don't talk about the distress
down video crease carved out now lit
carved out whatever you want to call it
now it's time for just the a shadow this
is the bobbi brown hi shadow that I was
showing you guys and it is so lit this
is called chlorophyll so what I like to
do is like with most of the sparkly
eyeshadows I like to spritz my brush
with a little fix plus you don't always
need to do this but I feel like it just
kind of amps it up are you guys seeing
this it is so freaking pretty and let me
tell you guys also which I've said
before in my videos but like the Kino
lights that I have I swear they don't
like show glitter as much as like a ring
light would or like daylight would so
this is actually like so glittery in
real life and in the Sun as you guys can
see if I hit it with a flash it's like
very very glittery especially in
sunlight
look so good I love it but I'm gonna add
a little bit more glitter I decided to
put this new magic super shock I shadow
on top it looks kind of crazy right now
because I use the same brush for the
green eyeshadow in this which I'm about
to do again but this is pretty much just
like a really pretty topper from
colour-pop cuz it it just has nice
reflex on it so I feel like you could
put it on top of any color and it would
look pretty lit so I'm gonna take that
on my flat brush and apply that to the
center that's what I want to be the most
reflective it's really patting it over
top blend it out towards the edges we're
gonna move on to foundation I'm using my
favorite right now it's the NARS natural
radiant long wear foundation mixing two
colors Barcelona and Syracuse this brush
is like my favorite foundation brush
recently Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood
complexion so I used this little side to
like blend out my foundation shades and
then I use the buffing side and just
buff it in like I mentioned I should
like to do a quick layer does anyone
else have like an embarrassing amount of
foundation leftover on your ears
randomly or is that just me because
honestly sometimes all like I get out of
the shower and I wipe my ear and I'm
like whoa girl
I forget to take it off my ear sometimes
do you guys have any 2018 rules I want
to upload more I want to have different
content create cool different videos I
love creating videos and I love doing
creative videos like editing creating
things that are just different you know
I just I want to do some more stuff I
kind of have this like passion that I
don't really talk about very often for
acting I don't even think or know if I'm
good I've done it a time or two but I
don't know I do little things on snap
sometimes were which are more like
comedic acting or like little skits I
won't do stuff like that I feel like
it's gonna be a good year
I feel super motivated I feel I think a
lot of people feel that way in the
beginning of the year it's toward the
end or the middle that you're like shit
I'm excited for this year I feel like a
lot of things are gonna be happening and
and just like growing she's making moves
you know I want to buy a house this year
it's like my lifelong goal I never
thought I would have even been able to
buy a house honestly Here I am
and we're house searching right now and
I'm so excited about it such a huge
accomplishment and I haven't even bought
it yet and I'm already like excited I'm
just excited that I could even look I
want to start a family
god willing I do wish people would stop
asking me though about it you know
asking people like when they're gonna
get pregnant
not when but just kind of like people
telling me like get pregnant are you
pregnant get pregnant tell us you're
pregnant like it's very it's like a lot
of pressure it's also something a
subject for a lot of people so I just
feel like I wish people would kind of
stop like asking me about it it's like
whenever it's meant to happen it will
happen I also think it's funny how
people ask on Instagram like are you
pregnant and it's like I'm not you think
someone's actually gonna respond and be
like yes and that's the way they're
gonna announce it you know I mean when
someone's pregnant and they're ready to
say it announce it they'll then they're
ready and they'll do it in their own
time I always think it's weird when
people ask that question like do you
honestly think that someone's just gonna
be like yeah you know especially like if
somebody's early on in pregnancy I kind
of feel like no one is gonna say that
and it's almost like a I don't know it's
so weird that people ask that question
people need to be like more sensitive
about pregnancy and just stop pressuring
people to have babies I do want to start
a family though I'm just I'm just saying
like it'll happen when it's meant to
happen you know if I would have had a
baby when I thought it was meant to
happen my life would have been a lot
more different I feel like but I would
be happy if I did get to do that here
perfect this foundation is so good oh I
just love it so much I really don't want
to take it down my neck because then I
have to take it off later and I'm just
filming but I feel like I also don't
have to and my brush but I usually use
is dirty so I'm gonna just use this made
you look brush even though I feel like
this is her powders but it's really soft
so I'm gonna use it on the neck just to
kind of buff it all out let's go ahead
and move on to concealer shall we is the
Becca
scrape midges aqua luminous in beige I
tried the urban decay concealer I meant
to tell you guys the new one and
honestly it just didn't work for me it
was a little too drying it just stuck to
like all my dry areas and I didn't I
just couldn't I couldn't get down with
it I wanted to like it I haven't really
actually kept up with like other reviews
or like what people thought of it just
didn't work for me
unfortunately my under eye lines were
like nah girl not today
using my LC sponge just gonna blend that
in foundation and concealer is one of
those things where like you find
something that works and it's just like
yes but I will say there are certain
foundations that work for me certain
times of the year that I love that other
times the year my skin doesn't look like
I'll try something later in the year
like when the months are colder or
warmer and then I love it
Giorgio Armani sometimes even though
it's like one of my favorite foundations
I feel like when it gets a lot hotter I
like to mix it with something a little
bit more matte or it doesn't work as
good as other times of the year I'm just
putting a little shape tape and tan sand
in that area where I see the hollows of
your eyes because I feel like it really
just makes it all look nice and seamless
I'm just gonna go ahead and set my under
eyes same bit that I always do I just
use a little Studio Fix in c-five right
under the eyes like lightly dab it just
a little bit so that the Laura Mercier
powder doesn't like get really stuck up
in my crease and that I'm just gonna do
the usual set the under eyes all right
we're gonna let that sit for a little
bit I actually forgot to put a little
bit of the concealer medium or ought to
put that on my nose to highlight so I'm
just gonna do that really quick love it
when like the line for the nose just
comes out perfect
chin here so we got going on for now
she's gonna blend that all out and then
I take this sponge and I squish it like
that so it's nice and little and then I
go down the nose and on the forehead
that me and my brothers play this game
we've always played it where we like say
quotes from movies and we have to guess
what movie it is cuz we love we're like
big movie buffs we watch movies all the
time and we like to watch them multiple
times like we've probably seen all of
our favorite movies like over five
hundred times and a lot of people like I
think it's weird they're like you're
gonna watch that again you've already
seen it like this week we're like so
I've blended enough let's just move on
to bronzer my hoola bronzer this is the
original hoola shade but I'm taking my
LCF eight brush then I'm gonna contour
my nose slightly using my Mac Studio Fix
powder this is darker than my skin tone
alright so I'm just contouring my nose
I'm gonna take this Bobby Brown
highlight in the shade Moonglow trying
to switch it up for you guys you know
looks like this like up here kind of do
that little half C thing okay now we're
in take a smaller brush and highlight
the nose I love highlighting like right
here just like that keep it though of
course what am I forgetting
get chin I love looking like I just ate
a bucket at KSC alright hey who loved
that highlight that is becoming one of
my favorites alright so for blush I'm
gonna be using this one by dose of
colors it is the mint for you amaze mint
looks like this oh yes look very fresh
very young youthful okay let's go ahead
and finish the eyes since we've finished
the face I feel like every time I say
something I'm looking for something I'm
always looking for something always
going back into the palette I'm taking
the first warm shade that we use
and I'm just gonna oh I need to dust
this off don't I this brush is really
nice for dusting away powder it's the
LCF 9 it's very soft I'm taking that
warm shade and I'm applying that I'm
using a pencil brush Joseph's colors so
now we're gonna go ahead and apply some
black liner to the waterline and
slightly on the lower lash line this is
mr. right by the balm cosmetics I hate
getting eyeliner on my contacts and it
happens every time so I'm just putting
it in the waterline and slightly below
on the lash line and then as I get more
eyeliner in the contact so I have to get
close to the mirror here but you guys
know what I'm doing I'm literally just
putting eyeliner I just can't get it on
my contact again that shit makes me feel
some type of way now I want to take the
pencil brush that I was using for the
eyeshadow and blend out those edges just
soften them up a little bit you can pick
up a little bit more of that warm toned
eyeshadow to soften the edges blend them
together take it up into the lashline
here inside you know what guys I'm gonna
deepen up this outer V just a little bit
taking this one from this Bobbi Brown
palette I'm just gonna add a little bit
like right in the lower lash line area
I'm actually take this navy blue like a
little tap of that and apply it to the
outer lash line up here so that I have
just some depth like it got a little too
faded see that just gonna give it a
little bit of smoke like a sultry smoke
now for an inner corner highlight I
might change it up from the picture cuz
I just had basically a highlight as my
highlight and the inner corner I think I
want to try to Pat McGrath highlight
looks white in the pan but it actually
has like a blue reflect I think it's
gonna be really pretty so I'm gonna hit
that up this shade is called astral
white pigment place that right here I
think we're good so for lashes I'm gonna
use my makeup Shayla Maybelline mascara
in baddest black I love this mascara and
I should not use this to coat my upper
lashes I mean this shit is black this
mascara I'll be using my Lillie lashes
I've used
a few times these are the makeup by
Samuel style my house of lashes glue
just gonna apply a thin layer of that on
to the band I've been like loving
filming makeup tutorials lately and I've
actually been like loving watching
makeup tutorials
whereas like sometimes I feel like when
you make youtube videos you I mean I
still watch videos all the time but like
I don't ever venture out and watch you
don't venture out as much and watch
newer channels you kind of just like
watch within your subscription feed
after a while every night before bed up
in like going through new channels and
watching their tutorials and like
watching other people who like new
people makes me like more motivated to
to film more makeup videos alright
someone look down and just place it in
the center the more you wear like the
same pair of lashes the easier it gets
to put them on so for my lip color I'm
gonna take strip down by Mac I'm gonna
line my lips with this of course you
guys already know imma do a nude look
that's what I did in the picture taking
a girl's got needs by Mac apply that on
the lips and then I'm gonna go back in
with the world lip pencil and just blend
it out should I do it gloss where's at
Bali donde esta atole at Saleh alright
so now to top off the lip I'm gonna use
the I love Sarah E colour-pop collab lip
gloss and this is called a thorn I'm
just gonna place that in the center I
can't just give it a little 6 plus and
boom alright and this is the finished
makeup looks green sparkly a bow hope
