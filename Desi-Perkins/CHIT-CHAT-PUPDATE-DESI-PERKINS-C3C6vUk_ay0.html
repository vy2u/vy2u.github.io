today's video is going to be just a
little update a little chitchat I'm also
gonna throw in a few favorites that I've
been loving that I'm like dying to talk
to you guys about if you follow me on
snapchat which you should I talk to you
guys a lot about things I'm loving right
now so I just have a few products mostly
this video is just to update you guys on
some exciting things going on some
changes no I'm not pregnant every time I
say I have something exciting everyone
thinks I'm pregnant no no no no no no no
no no no not yet one day not today not
tomorrow
one day just go ahead and get right into
this first thing I'm just gonna point
out the obvious
I did cut my hair and I love it I love
it so so so much been wanting to cut my
hair in a lob forever so I just decided
to just chop it off I said bow I need to
come see you ASAP I need to cut my hair
I have a mullet and I'm not okay with it
a lob is basically a long bob so long
enough to put up and you know do all the
things you want to do with it it's a
little bit shorter in the back and then
it comes a line down to the front
I wanted a length where I could still
clip in long extensions and it would
look natural I have the best of both
worlds and I just feel so chic
I feel shaky shaky and I love this
hairstyle when it looks messy it looks
better it's just super easy so if you
guys want a tutorial on how to style
short hair just like with you know an
effortless style like this video leave
me a comment down below whatever you
guys want to do that's it with my hair
just had to tell you guys I'm really
loving it so far I don't regret it in
two weeks I might regret it because you
know how we are we say we'll never cut
our hair again and then look at me I cut
my hair again
and then later we regret it but who
knows maybe I won't so far loving it so
the next thing I have to talk to you
guys about is a collaboration that I'm
doing with Key Australia err my favorite
sunglasses honestly every single time I
am wearing sunglasses on snapchat
they're always key they just have the
cutest frames and they're affordable
which I love I mean honestly I've always
wanted to be a designer I've always been
into fashion so designing these
sunglasses is something really exciting
for me and I was so just wanting to tell
you guys first for a while but obviously
I couldn't and then they announced it
the other day when
I was getting my haircut and I was like
oh my god I could finally tell you guys
like is this real it almost felt like it
was just happening to me like it was
almost like I was just finding out it's
hard not to be able to share everything
with you guys I just want to tell you
everything and sometimes we can't talk
about things forever so I'm just really
excited that I get to tell you guys
about it leave me any comments down
below I just want to hear you guys as
opinions what kind of styles you like do
you guys like oversized frames
I love oversized frames so you know give
us some ideas
they will be coming out fairly soon I
don't have the exact dates yet as to
when they're gonna be out but I know
it's like quick like they're gonna be
coming out soon I'll keep you guys
posted on all that you guys love the
sunglasses another exciting announcement
cannoli I've got a little puppy we
adopted a new fur baby and this is
cannoli she's waking up from a nap oh
she's so sweet
toneau Lee is a two month old chihuahua
terrier mix she is just the cutest
little thing
I love her so much so we adopted cannoli
from a rescue group called lovey Oh
rescue it's the same group that Katie
and John adopted zou I will link the
rescue group their Instagram down in the
description box they post really really
cool pictures of all their rescue pups
so I love seeing their dogs for some
reason when I saw cannoli she grasped
onto my heart and Steven saw cannoli and
he showed me he was like look look how
cute she is we both kind of just fell in
love with her it happened so fast you
guys we decided to email them and they
got back to us and they were like yeah
just come meet us tomorrow I wanted to
see how she would do with Harper because
I want her to have a connection with the
dog that we bring in or at least to get
along with the dog
Harper is completely acting normal
towards her not like loving her so much
but not being aggressive or anything I
should be worried about
everything's been working out so far and
we decided to adopt cannoli course I'm
not sleeping very much because can only
likes wake up at 4 a.m. and like cry and
play and thankfully Steven does most of
the work and stays up with her so if any
of you guys are looking to get a dog I
really really highly hi
we suggest getting a dog from a shelter
definitely don't have to just go to that
rescue group though you guys can go to
any shelter near you honestly they're
just some of the best dogs out there and
there's so many dogs that need a home
there's the cutest cutest dogs at
shelters when we went to get Harper
Stephen and I went to the pound every
single day remember that Stephen I just
wanted to say that because I really
strongly believe in adopting animals so
I wanted to let you guys know it's near
and dear to my heart we go to US alone
that's all I have to say about that so
those are the three like big exciting
things that have happened to me in the
last week now I just wanted to quickly
go into like a few of these products
figure we're already here talking might
as well talk about some beauty products
so let's go into some of the products
I've been loving this month some of you
guys already may know because you follow
me on snapchat but if you don't this is
definitely been my number one most loved
product recently and this is the coop re
coconut melt this stuff is everything
I've been trying so many under eye
creams and things for my eyes I just
feel like nothing's been doing a damn
thing for me then I got this stuff
because on the package it said under-eye
rescuer also its multi-purpose so you
can use this for your hair your skin
your lips your under eyes it just does
everything good for everything and it's
huge this huge huge jar I've just been
using it for my under eyes I did use it
on my hair the other day and my hair
felt phenomenal this has actually shown
me really really fast result it's been
doing amazing things for me so if you're
looking for something to hydrate your
under-eye if you're feeling like you
have a lot more under eye wrinkles than
usual a lot of the time it has to do
with drier skin this stuff extra
hydrating it hasn't clogged any of my
pores it's just been phenomenal I know
that like even if you get dry patches
around the mouth area you could just put
a little there put some on your lips I
also found that coconut oil well I've
read that it makes your eyelashes grow
cuz I've been putting it on my under
eyes it's been getting on my lashes and
I've noticed my lashes have been looking
a little bit I wouldn't say it's super
long or super full but there's just a
little judge you know just a little
little sprout I've been loving this I
highly recommend it and I'll probably
just be using it forever like a staple
there's a very few times when I find a
product that I'm
this is a ride-or-die forever that's one
of them there's another product from
that brand that I also really love you
guys always ask me how my skin glows
especially with flash photography it
looks like I highlight all over my body
it's the same brand coupe re the coconut
body glow this is also coconut oil also
so good for your skin and it has gold
sparkles in it it makes your skin look
so beautiful bronzy glowy goddess I
douse myself with this let me just get
some going here for you guys so even if
you're wearing a top like this and you
just want a little highlight you're
going out with your girlfriends just
want a little you want a little judge I
put it all over my collarbones just
everywhere I love this stuff and this is
actually like my second bottle because I
use so much so next we have the Sephora
radiant luminizing drops when I went to
Hawaii I started using this and oh my
god it's this like so mm-hmm
oh god I don't know how to explain it
it's just ah just looks so good you guys
like it looks so dewy glowy luminous
exactly what it says luminizing drops I
apply this first and then I apply a
powder highlight right over top and it
just gives you like that beam of light
that you want but if you just want it
like a nice glowy look I don't know who
doesn't want to over highlight but if
you're out there and you don't want to
over highlight this is a really really
good just pop it on out the door real
quick you look radiant
you look gorgeous these are amazing I
absolutely recommend them I have been
loving them alright the next thing I
have here is the new Tarte rainforest of
the sea foundation this foundation is
also something that I think is going to
be big for the hotter months coming up
I'm not a fan of these applicators I'm
not sure why a lot of brands are doing
them I can look past it if the product
inside is good what I like about this
foundation is it has like a really
lightweight texture so it doesn't feel
like you're wearing a crapload of
foundation it just feels light and then
on top of that it has a matte finish it
kind of messes with my brain because
I've never thought that Matt would be
hydrating but this is a water-based
foundation so it's really good for your
skin and I feel like for springtime
and the seasons coming up this is going
to be like big really great foundation
so the next thing I'm going to talk to
you guys about is this lip color that
I've been loving lately it's by girl
lactic it's in the shade stripped and it
is their matte lip paint so it's like a
matte liquid lipstick so not only do I
love the color of this lipstick it's
like that fresh peach nudie lip color
but I love the texture the way it feels
it's almost like I've been sleeping on
these like I know these are popular but
for some reason I don't know I don't
know where I've been because the texture
of these is phenomenal I love them I've
been like obsessed with them now and
I've been grabbing every single girl
lactic lip paint and wearing them more
because I find that I don't get that dry
feeling this has been such a great
formula and this color is just really a
go-to for me so I've been loving this
liquid lipstick so the last thing I have
to talk about are these eyelashes and
these are the queen bee Koko lashes
which are let me tell you guys amazing
Katy is the one who got me onto these
which I'm sure she got everyone onto
these they're basically like wispy long
magical unicorn lashes these lashes are
too Katy like House of lashes iconic
Tsar to me just like go to staple lash I
always thought I couldn't wear them
because my eyes are really small and
Katy has like those big Disney Princess
eyes so I feel like she can wear them
and they look great and I was afraid to
wear them and then one day I just tried
them I put them on and I was I just
instantly fell in love and somehow even
though they're so long they still can
look natural natural so if you guys ever
purchase eyelashes and they're too big
for your eyes you have to take the lash
put it on your eye and measure it out if
there's too much space on the outside of
the lash you have to trim it off let me
see here on my chest my naked chest
don't trim the lashes this way like the
length this way trim the length of the
band do you see what I mean so these
were a lot longer the band was a lot
longer it went out to here I cut all of
it off and I cut it off at the end of
the eye not the inside because the
inside has that perfectly tapered shape
that you need to make it look natural
once you do that they look so good you
have to make sure to do that with every
eyelash but these in particular because
they come like the strip is like this
long like
double the eye size that I have I still
love my ikonics but these have just been
my go-to lately but I recommend them
they're amazing life-changing Coco lash
queen bee don't sleep on it alright guys
so that is everything that's all I had
to talk to you guys about those were my
favorites and my announcements and I
wanted to say a quick thank you that's
really what I wanted to do because
without you guys I just don't know if I
would be in this position to do what I
love in social media now it's not just
about beauty which is like how I started
this channel but now it's just turned
into so much more than that too when if
I'm having a bad day you guys just come
and you make me feel better on social
media it is like a friendship and I just
feel really excited to share these
exciting things with you guys because I
feel like you've helped me get here I
literally look at Stephen and I'm just
like this is crazy like how is how do I
get so much love from these people like
it just means so much to me and you're
not just people sitting here watching

makeup you are friends to me and I
really appreciate everything that you've
done and all the support that you guys
have shown I'm really excited I'm really
happy I've never been so filled with

put into a little ball that's how I feel
so thank you guys I'm excited to see how
everything turns out and what happens
