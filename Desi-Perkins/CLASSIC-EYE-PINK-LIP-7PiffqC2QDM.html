many of you requested the eyeshadow look
that I had worn in my brow tutorial and
I just thought it was a perfect day time
look for a big event so I thought I'd do
a tutorial on it let's get started the
night before a big event I always apply
a night cream just to replenish my skin
this one is by me BD I know we're all
guilty of this but leaving makeup on
your eyes from the night before is
enough cute so make sure that you wipe
off any old crusty mascara and then use
a more la fresh makeup remover wipes
before I apply my makeup I always like
to put chapstick just to prep my lips so
they're nice and soft and this is the
olive natural beauty lip balm for a
daytime look I would usually opt for a
tinted moisturizer but I wanted to show
you guys this little trick that I do
which is taking a full coverage
foundation and mixing it with a little
bit of sunblock and this is the hang-ten
sunblock and this is going to protect
your skin while also diluting that
foundation so it's not as heavy and it's
kind of like making your own tinted
moisturizer but you have a little bit
more coverage for those of you who want
more coverage so I'm just buffing that
into the
and it kind of gives you a dewy effect
as well because of the sunblock the time
to can feel the under eyes let me use my
Mac Pro Longwear concealer I'm just
going to use my finger to apply this
because sometimes your fingers just give
a little bit more of a natural look and
then I'm going to set it with a
translucent powder
I'm picking up just a tiny bit of that
hello flawless powder from benefit and
I'm just going to apply it or I get a
little bit sharing so I'm going to
contour the hollows of my face a bit and
this is the Too Faced chocolate Soleil
matte bronzer you guys always want to
make sure to use a matte bronzer when
contouring because a shimmer isn't going
to make the hollows of your face look
natural the shimmer bronzer is more for
an all-over below but to contour you
always want to stay matte just going to
run that up the sides of my nose just
anything
to highlight Emily's Mac shell and this
is a cream product so I'm just going to
use my finger to apply this and I'm
going to just dab it because if you rub
this it's going to ruin all the makeup
you've placed underneath so when you
work with creams just make sure to dab
them for this look I want to stay in the
peach or pink family for the cheeks
because I kind of want that flushed look
like a very natural blush so this is
from my sleek palette and I'm just going
to apply that to the apples of the
cheeks and pull it up towards the temple
now to soothe my skin and also set my
foundation I'm use my Advent spray and
I'm just going to miss that all over my
skin moving on to the eyes I'm going to
apply a base all over the lid and up
towards the brow bone and this is Mac
soft ochre
I'm going to take max Blanc type and
this is just a bone shadow and I'm going
to apply that all over the brow bone and
I'm also going to apply that to the lid
basically there's going to ply it
everywhere
I'm going to take Siena and this is from
the Anastacio lavish palette and I'm
going to start mapping out the crease
area now with this shade you want to
bring it all the way in but you want to
keep it really light
to blend out a news 4 inch soda from the
same palette and I'm gonna use that
right above the eyeshadow we just place
I usually use a fluffier brush with the
transition shade and this is a Mac to g4
now I'm going to go in with my Inglot
gel liner and create that cat eye one of
you guys asked me where this brush is
from and Fran is going to come out with
a brush line that they never did so it
doesn't happen beam but I've seen a lot
of people use Luke brushes it's just a
foot brush style eyeliner pen Sigma
makes a nice one as well
after we've created the wings now we
really want to define the outer crease
and then use map cross-cultural any
matte Brown shadow looking for this look
and I'm just using the Sigma blending
brush and lightly applying this just to
the outer corner of the face
now this is one of my tricks what I like
to do after I'm done with everything is
grab my concealer and a concealer brush
and outline an outer part of my liner
and pull it up and this is going to make
your liner really sharp and the edges of
your eyeshadow look really clean so to
tie in the Pinker lip I'm going to take
this really pretty color it's called
opal and it's by Pacifica and I'm going
to use this as my inner corner highlight
it has really really pretty flexible
pink in it
and to define the lower lashline I'm
just using sienna and a little bit of
that cost personal color that we used in
the crease time to apply some lashes
these are hydronic by house of lashes
and they have been my ultimate favorite
lashes lately you guys haven't noticed
I've worn them a million times so the
eyes are done and now it's time to move
on to the lips I'm going to use a matte
pink Nouveau if that's how you say it
lipstick and this pink lip liner it's
kind of a generic brand I don't really
know where I got it from but any pink
liner will do
to control the frizz and flyaways I'm
going to use his balance group oil and
just apply that all over my hair down to
the ends for a finishing touch I'm going
to use my body balm and this day is by
the new blossom and I'm not really a big
perking fan and so I love this because
it smells like a Dreamsicle or kind of
like starburst and it's moisturizing the
skin while also making you smell nice
I also like to put it with the somebody
cuticles too if they're dry so once
you've added all your last finishing
touches you're looking complete and I
just think this look is perfect for any
daytime event whether you guys have a
graduation or a bridal shower anything
like that this blitz would work hope you
guys enjoyed the video and I'll see you
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
