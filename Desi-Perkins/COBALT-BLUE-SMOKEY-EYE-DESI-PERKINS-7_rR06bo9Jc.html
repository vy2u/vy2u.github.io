today's tutorial is going to be on this
be smokey eye
I decided to play around with blue just
because it's been a while and I also
wanted to make a smokey eye that was
still wearable but with color so I
really just incorporated the blue in the
center and then the waterline and of
course I'm wearing blue contacts today
these contacts are from isolytic a-- or
silica I think I'm saying that wrong
I'll put the text right here where
they're from I'll also link them down
below they're honestly in my opinion
probably the best contacts I've ever
worn I feel kind of crazy with the blue
ones to be honest I love the way that
the contacts look as real as they can
possibly look when you look really
closely like it's hard to tell their
contacts color that I prefer is ochre
which I've worn before on snapchat you
guys have asked me but this is probably
the best contact out there in my pin me
so this is the makeup look and if you're
interested keep on watching so before
you start your makeup the first thing
you want to do is prep your skin I
really want to make sure my under eyes
are hydrated for when I apply concealer
so I'm going to apply the Aphrodite
olive oil I cream and this is anti-aging
and hydrating so when applying eye cream
you always want to use your ring finger
because your ring finger is the most
delicate on the under eye and you want
to make sure to be really delicate so
that you're not pulling and tugging on
the skin because it is a thinner skin
than the rest of your face
we don't want wrinkles more wrinkles so
I'm just going to dab it on I'm actually
gonna put a little bit more on cuz heat
so I'm just going to let that soak in
and I also have been breaking out a
little bit in this region so I'm going
to apply an acne treatment gel this is
Zack's it does it loves it and I'm just
going to apply this pretty much along
this whole area because I don't know
what's going on over here but there's a
situation and this product has no
alcohol so it's not going to dry out
your skin any product that contains
alcohol is going to be a little bit
drying
I don't know what's going on over here
it's very interesting interesting I use
that to describe anything but it's not
necessarily a good thing it's like when
you don't want to say a bad thing you
just want to stay neutral but we all
know what interesting means and just
lastly for my skin prep I'm going to use
my two-faced primer and this is the
hangover replenishing face primer I
really like this one because it's super
hydrating mostly because it smells like
pina colada to be honest so I'm just
going to apply it with patting motions I
just got back from New York when you
travel airplane air just makes your skin
so dry so I always make sure to one wear
a hydrating mask on the plane if I can
if I don't have to wear makeup and then
to make sure to really hydrate when I
get back so I'm going to start off by
priming my lids and I'll be using the
Smashbox 24-hour primer I'm just going
to go ahead and apply that with a sigma
precision angled brush
I'm just going to go ahead and set that
with a translucent powder this is the
makeup forever powder picking up this
bone color from the tartlet in the bloom
palette just to highlight the brow bone
area I'm just going to apply that with
this flat matte brush and use it to
highlight the brow bone
next I'm picking up the wear by Urban
Decay and this is a cool tone light
brown using a smith 230 brush first look
down get the brush into the eye socket
and then I'm going to look forward and
really map out my shape when my eyes are
open we're going to smoke this into the
crease and make a v-shape on the outer
corner and also whatever is left over on
the brush you're going to flick it
outwards like this to kind of give it a
cat eye shape and really this color is
just our transition shade but it's also
really good to map out the shape of your
eyeshadow with a lighter shadow that way
when we go in with the dark colors we
don't make any mistakes and it doesn't
end up looking crazy sometimes I take a
clean blending brush and go along the
edges to diffuse it even more we want it
to look really soft next we want to pick
up a dark brown eye shadow to really
deepen the crease I'll be using this one
right here it's a dark brown shadow and
it's called multi tasker it's from the
tartlet one palette I'll be using a luxe
e23 one brush for this so I'm really
going to focus this on the outer corner
first
I'm softly flicking this outwards
I'm always outside of my room wanting to
come in but then I let her in and she's
really loud so she's been banished right
now
this look is all about building depth
that's with every smoky eye so you just
want to make sure to start from your
lightest color and then work your way up
to the darkest so then I'm going to just
do windshield wiper motions throughout
the crease going into the inner corner I
like to do this with my eye open
especially if you don't have a super
defined crease because then you can kind
of just see how the shadow is going to
look when your eyes open opposed to
going like this trying to fill in my
crease this way but then when I open my
eyes you see how I have the folds it
could change on you so you just want to
make sure to do with your eye open if
you have this problem if you have a deep
defined crease then god bless your soul
very lucky you could just do it normal
so I'm getting it on my lid as well
because I'm going to be covering most of
my lid besides the center I'm just going
to keep the center free of any eye
shadow because we're going to be
applying a more metallic shade there
clean brush buff out the edges I really
like this brush in particular to do this
it's a Mac two-to-one it's really really
fluffy and lightweight so it's really
good for blending edges because it's not
too dense to where it's going to like
move too much around it just lightly
grazes the skin I'm also going to take
this kind of just stick it right here in
the socket give it a little wiggle to
get this depth in the inner corner as
well I do that first and then open your
eyes see how there's like gaps there
then you want to fill in those gaps if
you do have a lid that kind of folds in
like mine does in little layers
I'm going to take max uninterrupted it's
just this mustardy brown with the mock
two-to-one and buff out the edges with
this color just to you know add a little
bit of color while we buff this color is
slightly warmer so it's just going to go
over the dark brown without making it
gray and muddy the other brown was a
little bit cooler so if you put the
cooler one on top it might make it a
little bit ashy we don't want that so
and then I'm going to keep going back in
and deepening up the dark around the eye
and I just go back and forth with those
two processes building up the darker
color and then blending out the edges
with the lighter color or a clean brush
until I get the shape that I want so
after we've done the dark brown we're
going to deepen the eye look a little
bit more using a black eye shadow this
one is by Natasha de Nonna and it's the
blackest black and I'm going to be using
a beau Kashi eyeshadow brush to really
pack on the color so I'm going to start
with applying it on the inner part of
the eye we don't want it to be too black
so I'm just applying a little bit on the
outer corners to deepen it up just along
the lid space and blend it up into the
crease but not past the crease so next
I'm picking up colourpop's etiquette
shadow and the Luxy short shader brush I
find that these eye shadows work best
with synthetic brushes and I'm going to
pop this into the center where we left
this gap I'm going to focus most of the
colour there and then lightly start to
blend the edges of that into the darker
shadows so that it's nice and blended
and not just like a little chunk of blue
if you're scared to wear color on your
eyes this is a really good way to do it
just a pop of color in the center of the
lid just want to lightly buff out those
edges so now I'm just going to take a
makeup wipe make sure to dust off any
eye shadow because I did have a little
bit of fallout you can also take this
time to like clean up the edge of the
makeup here as well which is
is sharpen it up so now I'm going to do
my foundation and I'm going back to the
L'Oreal infallible Pro matte in the
shade 108 just because I want some full
coverage today and I also want to tan
foundation is really nice to cover you
know help these breakouts instantly
covered gone ain't nobody got time for
that I'm going to bring that down your
neck as well so that you're all one
color a little bit on your ears now I'm
going to go on to concealer and I like
to mix ginger and custard from NARS
ginger is a little bit warmer and it has
that salmony undertone that's going to
color correct and then custard is super
bright so it's going to highlight I like
to put the ginger one a little bit
closer to this area where I get more
darkness just there and then I take
custard and really go into the highlight
points looking crazy Cupid's bow I'm
using this little baby beauty blender
I'm going to use this for the under eye
area I'm just going to blend it all out
this is the medium-size beauty blender
they have a really baby one which I
don't really like because I have long
nails so by the time I hold the little
one it like my nails cover the whole
surface of the other one this one is
just slightly bigger and I feel like
it's a lot more convenient for me and I
flipped it around to just blend out the
edges I'm also going to take custard and
highlight the center of the forehead
because we want to balance out the light
so it's not just like under the eyes so
the whole point of this is to bring
light to any areas of your face that
come forward those areas will naturally
catch more light so by adding the
lightness in all of the areas it's going
to balance out the whole face take it
down the nose his contacts are kind of
freaking me out a little bit and of
course the chin would also catch a
little bit more light so we'll put it
right there go ahead and blend that all
out
so I'm just going to take the little
beauty blender and dip it into my Laura
Mercier translucent powder and just
going to put that on the under eyes to
set the concealer and putting it on the
sides of the nose as well because that's
where we have shadows that make your
nose look wider I know I look crazy
right now so you want to let it set for
about a minute and then what you do is
take a fluffy brush and dust it all away
all the excess powder when I finish off
the eyes I'm going to take this blue
liner this is the drama liquid pencil
this shade should blue we're going to go
below it we're going to go with blue
Lancome blue liner sorry I turn for me
to show you how to do this because I
have to be really close especially with
contacts I'm just going to apply this in
the waterline so I'm going back into the
black shadow with a detailed shader
brush by zueva and I'm going to go right
under the blue with a black shadow
really chop off the excess because we
don't want any fallout and start
building the block slowly up to smoke
out the black we're going to go back
into Mac uninterrupted with a morphe e36
brush I think this is Katie's maybe got
mixed up in my brushes when we went to
newer but I do really like this brush so
it may just end up with her comfy
t-shirts never to be seen again so I'm
just going to go ahead and smoke out the
black so I don't look like I just have
like a harsh black line under my eye so
now that we have it all smoked out I'm
taking my mary-lou manizer by the balm
cosmetics and I'm going to use that as
an inner corner highlight this is my
favorite product to use in the inner
corner because it's like so bright
separate be applying this here is really
going to open up your eyes especially
with this super heavy smoky eye it's
going to bring a little light to your
eyes they're not so dark while we're
here I'm just going to use this to
highlight the Cupid's bow
since I already have it in my hand and
the tip of my nose so I'm quickly going
to just put a thin line on the lash line
just to hide the false lash band that
we're going to apply over top and for
that I'll be using the Illamasqua
precision ink liquid liner this liner
has a really nice fine tip it's going to
just get right into those lash areas
that are kind of hard to reach such a
thin line that you can barely even see
it's just for the sole purpose to hide
the lash band so to finish off the eyes
you want to add mascara and false lashes
I'm going to be using this new mascara
from Too Faced it's the better than sex
waterproof waterproof is key especially
for lower lashes not so much for me
because my lower lashes are like
itsy-bitsy but like for someone who has
long lower lashes if they touch the
bottom you always want to use waterproof
and the packaging for this the packaging
is everything for this mascara there's
like water drops on it and you can
actually feel all the water drops like
textured so I'm just going to go ahead
and apply this top and bottom and then
I'm going to apply house of lashes
ikonics
duh day
next step we're going to finish off the
face so I'm going to be using a liquid
bronzer to kind of just warm up the
whole face and give a nice glow and this
one is by temp - oops
dropped it no problem this is in the
shade warm glow I'm just going to take a
few drops on the back of my hand and I'm
just going to start applying it where I
would apply my contour also following
that up to the hairline and then going
over that with Mac's
give me Sun to set it all I'm going over
that with heatwave and this is a baked
bronzer by be a bombshell cosmetics so
this one is a little bit like a
highlighter so we want to take that
lightly dust it over everything it's
just going to give the most subtle glow
to the bronzer not highlighter it's just
a glow to the bronze so for my favorite
part of makeup its highlighting I'm
going to just spritz whoops spritz a
highlighting brush and then I'm going to
go into my Laura Geller gilded honey
which I love and apply it to the highest
points so for blush I'm going in with
Mac's ambering rose and I'll be using
this Marc Jacobs brush right here don't
want to go too heavy on the blush
because I'm already so heavy everywhere
else you know I'm saying like my whole
face there's a lot going on here so like
blush we don't want like Mimi gonna set
everything with my mac fix+
I really need a new bottle cuz this is
about to spit at me like a camel oh it's
good spritz okay now that I'm putting it
to the test on camera decides to acts
right the onto the lips I'll be using
Mac's stripped down lip liner
so I really want to use a nude lipstick
and I just went to New York recently and
we got to make our own lipsticks and I
decided to make a nude color I'm a
little hesitant to use it because I feel
like you guys it's not like for sale
anywhere we just made it for fun I think
I'm gonna use it anyway just because
like it's so exciting I just want to use
it once we went to the bite Beauty lab
they have this lab in New York City
where you get to go and custom make your
own lipstick and anyone can go do this
so I thought it was really really
awesome like if there's a color you can
think of they can make it for you which
is really really cool so I made a matte
nude even get to pick your scent Oh
smells so good I picked citrus mango but
they do have another new that I was
wearing the whole trip which is this one
it's honeycomb it's kind of similar
actually just mine's a little bit
lighter so I quickly decided that I
wanted to make my brows a little bit
darker without using a pencil so I'm
going to be using the make me brow by
essence cosmetics and this is just an
eyebrow gel it's tinted so it's going to
give me a little bit of coverage but not
too much towards like overpowering just
going to define them a little bit I'm
just going to apply a little bit of
hairspray to my flyaways before you know
I do my intro outro shots for you guys
this one is by Pantene pro-v it's an
alcohol-free hairspray it's a level 2 so
it's just a light hold it smells so good
to invite FC glambag this month I also
got the NYX liquid suede lipstick this
isn't the shade kitten heels I know the
eye is already super bold and of course
naturally I'm going to do a nude lip but
to give you guys another lip option I'm
going to do red and this is going to
make the look a little bit more
editorial and just like intense it's
going to line my lips first with Mac
Ruby woo
you
so this lip option is a little bit more
bold and like I said it's definitely not
for everybody but if you are a freelance
makeup artist doing an editorial look
the bright red lip with the blue smokey
eye for an editorial shoe money it would
be really really striking alright guys
so that is it for this tutorial I really
hope that you guys enjoyed the video
give it a thumbs up if you did don't
forget to comment down below what you'd
like to see next and I'll see you guys
in my next video bye Canole then taking
my mini Beauty bill under the minute I'm
if I was green I would die Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
