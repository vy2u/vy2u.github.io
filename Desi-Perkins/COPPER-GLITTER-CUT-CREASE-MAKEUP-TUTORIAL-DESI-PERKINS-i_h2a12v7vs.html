since today's video is gonna be a
tutorial on this makeup look that I'm
wearing right now in my last video that
I uploaded you guys all requested that I
do that makeup look especially on
Twitter and so I decided to do that look
except switch the lip color to something
a little bit less basic you know what I
mean I needed to amp it up you could
really do any lid color but I just
thought glitter was appropriate it's
been a while since I've done anything
with glitter I just went all out I did a
glitter cut crease winged liner mmm give
it to me I really hope that you guys
enjoy the tutorial let's go ahead and
get started
alright so I've already primed my lids
and I'm going straight in with Mac
chrome yellow I wanted to use yellow in
the transition shade of the eye shadow
because I want it to be a little bit
different a little surprised a little
peekaboo color and I'm using a luxe e23
one to gently buff that into my upper
crease next I'm going into motives heat
wave which is just a tangerine colored
eyeshadow and I'm layering that right
over top closer to my crease color this
time so that the yellow peeks through
and I'm using the same luck ZBrush I've
really been loving this brush especially
if you have a smaller eye socket it's a
smaller brush so it just really gets in
there to deepen up the crease I'm going
into the dose of colors hidden treasure
palette and i'm picking up key which is
just a medium to dark matte brown and
i'm gonna apply that in the outer crease
of my eye and just want to build that
until it's as dark as you want and then
I'm taking whatever's left on the brush
winging it outwards and then also
dragging that into the inner corner of
my socket but keeping most of the
darkness on the outer part of the eye
I'm gonna pick up crown from the same
palette and apply that to my lid but as
you guys can see here I kept it in the
video but I added this color I felt it
was a little too red so I tried to take
it off my makeup remover wipe was dry
didn't really quite work so I just
decided to go right over that with coin
which is just a lighter gold and in the
end I'm not really sure why I paid too
much attention to the lip color because
I just put a lot of glitter over it
anyways but you know you win some you
dim sum I'm using a concealer brush and
that eye shadow to kind of just cut the
crease as you guys could see there now
I'm going into copper Ella this is a
violet Voss glitter and lit glitter
adhesive and I'm just gonna start
packing that on using a synthetic
concealer brush cutting that crease and
just adding that glitter all over my
lighting was actually a little too
bright here it was overpowering the
glitter but anyways you win some you dim
sum I'm going in with the Tarte gel
liner and a Smith cosmetics liner brush
and I'm just gonna give myself a wing
I actually really struggled using gel
liner over the glitter it was not being
my friend because the glitter was too
chunky for the gel liner so I had to
switch it up to good old-fashioned NYC
liquid liner the NYC liquid liner is
just better first litter because it gets
into all those little cracks and it's
just a smoother application so I just
went in with that instead and then
applied some mascara this is the Tarte
lights camera lashes mascara and of
course I'm gonna pop on some lashes real
quick these are the House of lashes
iconic I'm just gonna take that NYC
liquid liner one more time over the lash
band just in case there's any eyelash
glue trying to play you you want to make
sure to cover that up any glitter
fallout and then I'm gonna let the eyes
chill for a second move on to the face
I'm using L'Oreal true match foundation
this is my first time actually using
this foundation I think I got a shade a
little too light
for me unfortunately but I'm applying
that with a Beautyblender and then
moving on to my concealer I'll be using
the NARS creamy concealer in custard and
ginger right now I'm using ginger and I
realized I ran out made a sad face and
moved on to custard custard is really
nice for highlighting but ginger is a
little bit more natural which I like and
I'm just gonna take this all over the
face on the high points draw tree on
your forehead as Steven likes to say and
blend it all in with the Beauty Blender
next I'm gonna pick up the Laura Mercier
translucent powder get my Beauty Blender
in there and set the under-eye concealer
I just like to take a little bit of
product and lightly is that the under
eyes so it doesn't get too cakey just
set the rest of my face I'll be using
the Maybelline fit me I really really
like this powder I just started using it
and I am a fan so I really really enjoy
the finish that it gives my skin picking
up my man give me Sun and my Marc Jacobs
brush I'm going to apply that to the
hollows of my face and around the
perimeter so the forehead the jawline
you know all the places you want to look
is 'old or bronzey now I'm taking the
laura geller and gilded honey highlight
and applying that to the tops of my
cheekbones I also lightly spritz some
mac fix+ onto the brush before dipping
it into the gilded honey just to give me
more of a bangin highlight it's 1 a.m.
in the morning and I realized it just
said bang and highlight I don't really
know what I'm saying right now but I
will continue with the voiceover I'm
taking this Tarte blush in the shade
tipsy which is a really bright coral
that's gonna bring together those
Coralie shades on the eye
and finishing off the bottom of the eyes
I'm going in with the same colors we
used in the crease I just skipped the
yellow and went straight on to the
orange shade that we used and the dark
brown because I feel like the yellow
might have looked a little weird under
my eyes so I just went with the orange
and the dark brown color and smoked the
lower lash line out real quick to open
up the eyes I'm using the benefit high
brow okay I found that this product
stays in my waterline more than anything
and I just applied to the waterline to
open up the eyes and then add mascara to
the lower lashes and then a little bit
to the top just to blend them with my
falsies I'm taking the mary lou manizer
by the balm and applying that in inner
corner as my highlight this is pretty
much what I always use for my inner
corner highlight magical for my lips
I'll be using girl app girl app dip her
lactic stripped matte lip paint which is
amazing this color is everything I love
it so much so I'm just gonna apply that
straight from the tube no lip liner
required this lipstick looks great on
its own it's my favorite at the moment
alright guys that's it for the tutorial
this is the finished makeup look really
hope that you guys enjoyed it give it a
thumbs up if you did
also you guys really heavily requested a
