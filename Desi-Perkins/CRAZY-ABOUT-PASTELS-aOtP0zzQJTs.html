they don't bring me down don't don't
bring me don't don't bring me welcome to
my crazy about pastels tutorial I'm
gonna start off by applying this Nicole
by OPI ruffles nail polish make sure you
apply two coats but no topcoat needed so
after that you're ready to go I always
like to moisturize my hands after
applying nail polish so I'm gonna use my
Pacifica coconut nectar body butter now
make sure you apply a primer to even out
your skin tone and I'm using the pixie
Beauty primer to reduce the bags under
my eyes I'm gonna pop on these chlorin
patches and they're gonna double as a
shadow shield for me today so start by
applying your primer and I'm using soft
ochre by Mac pick up a bone color I'm
using Blanc type by Mac and apply it to
your brow bone as a highlight I'm using
this NYX love and Rio eyes shadow
palette and I'm gonna pick up the
darkest Brown in the palette and apply
that in my crease and I'm slowly gonna
build this into the crease making it
darker as I go this shadow is pretty
pigmented so it's not going to take a
lot of shout out to build up the color
I'm going to take this matte peachy
shade it's called peach for the stars
and this is from the tarte magnificent
palette I'm just gonna pack this onto
the lid until I get the color that I
want this also helps to like clean up
the crease if you guys need to I'm gonna
go ahead and pop this off now amazing
stars and rockets by Mac and I'm gonna
use that as my inner corner highlight
this is such a pretty color it's like a
lilac II bright shimmery I don't know
how to describe kind of color now it's
time to apply your liner and this is NYC
liquid liner I've been having the
hardest time with liner this week I feel
like when my eyeliner comes out bad it's
a bad week but hopefully it looks okay
here I'm popping on a house of lashes
and these are called iconic now I'm
gonna mix these three shades from my
makeup forever flash palette and i'm
gonna use this shade along my waterline
and also along the liner that we created
earlier kind of creating a slight double
wing I don't know what you would call
this but I'm just gonna pop it right
along the bottom of the liner
and I'm going in without stars and
Rockets again and kind of smudging that
out I decided to take a little bit of a
purple mixture that I made from that
palette and also apply it to my
waterline off-camera I adjusted a little
bit of this Mac Studio Fix all over my
face and here I'm applying my honest
ostia Beverly Hills concealer pick a
light pink blush this is from the Tarte
off-the-cuff palette and apply that to
your cheeks
I created a lilac e color with that make
up forever flash palette and I'm just
gonna apply that as my lipstick thank

see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
