for today's video I'm gonna be doing a
favorite I have a few products here that
I've been loving throughout the recent
month but I wanted to share with you
guys let's go ahead and get started the
first product I have to talk to you guys
about is this orb a body cream this is
one of those luxury nice-to-have
products I wouldn't say it's a total
must-have but I would pick it up again
because it's rich and it smells so good
that's really what gets me about this is
the smell it has this really fresh clean
scent to it I'll wear this in the
morning for the gym or something like
that when obviously I'm not wearing
perfume but I still want to hydrate my
skin and it just smells so good I get a
ton of compliments asking me what
perfume mom wearing but it's this stuff
it's at first time I tried it I thought
the scent was going to be a little too
strong for me because I'm very sensitive
to smell that give me spikes if
something is too strong and then I used
it a couple of times and it was amazing
it's like the perfect amount of scent to
where you apply it all over your body
and it just laughs all day and it is so
nice to have so nice the next item I
have is a skincare product that I've
recently started using and this was
actually recommended to me by Katie the
true creme aqua balm and this stuff is
insanely hydrating it is a gel
moisturizer so you guys know I love the
Tarte h2o and I feel like this is a step
above that as far as hydration level so
maybe if you're a little more oily you
might want to lean towards the Tarte or
maybe if you have super dry skin you
would want to lean towards the belief
aqua balm cream this stuff is just
making everything look super glowy and
hydrated it says that it's supposed to
minimize your pores and help with
dullness and uneven texture does it I
don't know I haven't seen the fruits of
that labor yet because I've only been
using it since around Switzerland and
coming back from that I'll let you guys
know if that happens the next product I
have are lipsticks and these are new by
dose of colors they are the lifted up
lipsticks and they look like this I've
been wearing them so this one looks a
little old Kostis
maybe it's almost better do a little
crusty the texture of these lipsticks is
unbelievable and not
really really why I love them they have
this hydrating super pigmented and
creamy texture that doesn't get in the
cracks of your lips do you know what I'm
saying like when a regular lipsticks
tends to show the Chapas of your lips
this just like bulldozes right over it
and fills in all those little cracks I'm
going to swatch toast for you guys which
is of course one of my favorites because
it is a really nice nude and here we go
that's one swipe of this lipstick
there's no areas where the pigmentation
starts to fade sometimes when you swipe
ballistic it'll be really really
pigmented when you first hit the top and
then it'll fade towards the bottle and I
wouldn't say this is super nude this is
more of like a lobby nude the other
color that I really love is Brule I've
been mixing these two colors together so
you can see this one it has more of a
pink undertone and it's really really
nice mixing them together because as
dark as this one looks on my arm
sometimes it can look too light on my
lips so I like to mix these two together
and it's just super pretty it's the
combination I wore in my last makeup
tutorial with the jaclyn hill morphe
palette and i love the combination the
formula everything on these are
incredible and i hope they come out with
new colors because there are some colors
that I would definitely rock in this
formula with all of science the next
item is also a lip product is something
that I've just been wearing a lot lately
and it's the Too Faced melted matte
lipstick this is in the shade lady balls
that name is kind of funny label feel
like it's such a nice flattering neutral
red that makes your teeth look white I'm
wearing it right now actually mixed it
with Mac night mom I've always been a
huge fan of these melted matte lipstick
formulas I love that really bright
orange one that's one of my favorite
lipstick colors I think it's called Anna
strong firm roll I think that's what
it's called but I wear that one all the
time to you and the formula is so
comfortable it's not super drying it's
just beautiful it's not streaky it's not
patchy you're looking for like a really
good just read a red blue tone red would
you say yeah blue tone red this is the
one you want the next item is really
exciting because it's a drugstore
product and any time I find something
that's really really good and comparable
if not better than
high-end products I get really excited
obviously they're a better price that's
really why this is the l'oreal
voluminous voluminous lash tara dice
mascara for some reason I couldn't get
that name out this is a waterproof
mascara which I love because if you have
really straight eyelashes or your lashes
don't stay curled I find that waterproof
mascara always helps keep the curl a lot
longer and for me I need that 100% this
stuff has been so good it recently came
out and I've been wearing it a lot and
loving it some of you guys wrote me on
snap and we're like that mascara is
amazing you have to try it and that's
really what got me to try it now I love
it
so thank you you know my lashes are
still babies but this stuff really loves
them it has that formula where it sticks
to each individual lash and almost
adverse to every single lash without
making it overly clumpy it is more of a
wet formula but it's not too wet I'm
just using all the best words right now
I feel like but I really really like it
so let me know if you guys have tried it
what you think so my next favorite item
is she's so excited to be here oh your
hair is looking kind of crazy right now
no she should she tucked her ears back
oh the next two items are things that
you guys have seen in my videos a lot
lately I'm sure because I'm obsessed
with these items for the globe the first
one is the Marc Jacobs quu drops and the
second is the iconic London illuminator
in the shade original I mix these two
items together and the reason I do that
is because I find that these are super
strong and if you like a really really
strong highlight like really strong then
this is going to be good for you so when
I mix these two together I get that
natural wet look but with a pop because
this adds a lot of pop if that makes
sense I always love to mix makeup
products that I already have to get
something that's totally different
I love these items I always use them
even when I have a natural makeup look
when I add these it just like makes the
skin look so luminous this is what I
used in my how I cover my acne video and
I swear it makes such a difference
because it adds such a healthy skin like
glow to your face that no matter how dry
or broken out you are it just draws the
attention to that luminosity and it's
just the perfect balance I love these
two items and you know if I were to
choose between having to get one or the
other I would say if you like more of a
natural finish but still like a nice
glow the Marc Jacobs drops but if you
want like a really intense highlight in
your face which I always like to I would
get the iconic drop the last thing I
have is the way a hair oil I've also
used this in videos before and this
stuff is so nice I'm going to round
brush my hair I like to use an oil when
my hair is damp so I child dry it and I
add a few drops of this mostly on my
ends because that's where I have a lot
of the bleach and over-processed things
happening down there so I apply this all
over my ends and it just gives such a
smooth nice
blowout if you have a problem with frizz
or anything like that like I'm telling
you try this hair oil and if you haven't
tried a shampoo the conditioner also try
it because that stuff is so good alright
guys so that's it those are all my
favorites everything I've been loving
you guys have any favorites let me know
in the comments below so I can go check
them out and I will see you guys in my
next video bye
it makes your whole line a mighty I'm
tickling tickle very scream being with
my period</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
