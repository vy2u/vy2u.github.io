for today's tutorial I decided to show
you guys how to do this double winged
cool-toned
I look I always do warm tones that's
just what I prefer and what I think
complements me but maybe cool tones
complement some of you guys better so
this whole video is just the eyes
I didn't address in my face because I
was actually on the way out and then I
just decided to film the eye look so I
really hope you guys enjoy this video
and if you like what you see then keep
on watching so for this I look today I'm
going to be using this it cosmetics
naturally pretty palette this is the
Volume one palette I think they just
came out with volume 2 this palette has
a ton of warm tones which I've done
videos on but it also has all of these
cool tones and since all of you requests
that I use cool tones I'm gonna be doing
a cool-toned I look today so I'm gonna
start off with sheer joy and this color
is definitely sheer I'm mostly using it
just to set my eyeshadow base so it
makes it easier for us to blend all our
colors
then I'm going into violet and I'm just
taking a little bit at a time with this
so I don't want it to be super purple or
anything and I'm just lightly blending
that on the outer V of my eye with a
blending brush and I like to use a
little bit of product at once and then
build on it that way the blending looks
more seamless and then I also take my
blending brush and just make sure to
blend out that edge right there you
never want just something to come to a
really harsh stop you want to just blend
it out so I like to feather it upwards
and I picked up a little bit more
product and I'm just building on that
color even more until it's as deep as I
want it to look now to deepen it up I'm
going into Newar which is a really
pretty matte black shade and once again
I'm basically repeating the same exact
process that I've been doing just with
black and with black eyeshadows you
always want to definitely pick up a
little as product as possible so that
you can blend it out really nicely
because black eyeshadows probably the
hardest eyeshadow to blend so I'm just
blending that out and this is a little
bit tedious but don't worry if you want
a perfect blend it is always very
tedious
so for the lid I'm gonna pack on soft
light it's a really pretty bone color
but it has somewhat of like a stone
undertone so like a little bit of a
grayish hint and I'm packing that onto
the lid these eyeshadows actually have
anti-aging properties so they are
supposed to diffuse fine lines on your
lids so if you have that problem this
pallets really good for that and then
once I packed it on I'm gonna just go
back in with my blending brush and just
clean off any of that shadow that may
have gone into my crease so picking up
transforming pearl this shade is
actually a shade you can pop on over any
of the matte eyeshadows in the palette
and it will give them a nice little
shimmery effect I'm placing it on top of
that color that we just put on our lid
just in the inner corner though and it's
just gonna brighten up that area
time for our winged liner and as far as
winged liner goes what I like to do
first is create a line from my lower
lash line to the tail of my brow and
that's just gonna work as our guide and
then you want to take that and go back
on itself kind of creating like a
triangle shape and filling in any of
those little spots that you have there
especially closer to the lash line and
the last step is always going into the
inner corner why is there a crow outside
of my window we've got a mess up my
voice over anyways you guys can make the
wing as thin or thick as you want or you
know what if you don't want to win at
all it's not your thing just go ahead
and skip this wing step I always like to
take a little bit of concealer and just
sharpen up that edge a lot of you guys
ask me if I use teeth but I think doing
the concealer always makes it look that
way at the end because it just cleans up
any eyeshadow they got anywhere else so
now I'm gonna take the color that we
used in the crease obviously I can't
film without putting the mirror in front
of my face I'm sorry but I'm trying and
oh oh come on desert right you can do it
there you go so I'm just using that
violet shade on the lower lash line
right under the water line of our eyes
and I'm just gonna build on that just a
bit and then taking black I'm gonna
create a double winged effect with the
noir eyeshadow I'm just lightly flicking
out the lower lash line just kind of
mimicking the wing that we have up top
and this is easiest with an angled brush
and to really make our eyes pop I'm
gonna put a white liner in the waterline
I'm just gonna open our eyes up a little
bit and of course before I pop on my
fake eyelashes I'm just gonna apply a
light coat of mascara to both top and
bottom and then just apply your favorite
eyelashes I'm also gonna be applying the
lower lashes for this look and I'm gonna
show you guys how I apply them because a
lot of you have asked me so you want to
use tweezers it's just really easy pop
it on to the center first and then you
just take the outer and inner corners
and pop them in and you definitely want
to push the lashes upwards because you
don't want them to fall flat on your
lower lash line or else will be really
uncomfortable so I use my finger to kind
of prop them up and this is the finished
look
alright guys so that is it for this
tutorial I really hope you enjoyed this
quick video if you guys have any
requests leave them in the comments down
below I will be doing an updated
foundation routine so I didn't show it
in this video because I've just been
doing it the same and I didn't want to
keep doing the same process over and
over again so I will film that and start
linking it in all my other videos until
it changes but I will always keep doing
my blush my highlight and all that if
it's different so uh yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs
up if you did and give it a thumbs up if
you're just proud of me because I used
only cool tones that's an accomplishment
and I did it for you guys cuz I know a
lot of you guys request cool tone looks
but it I'll see you guys at my next
tutorial bye is if you guys are clean if
you guys are hey guys welcome back to my
channel so I someone told me to stop
making these faces somebody get wrinkles
