today's tutorial is gonna be on this
look right here
it's a bronzy cranberry ish a smokey eye
with a pretty dramatic wing clearly I
sound different I've been sick if you
guys follow me on Twitter you know that
I've been sick and I lost my voice so
this is the best that I've been and I
decided to film videos anyways even
though I sound like this because the
show must go on and I want to make sure
to get some holiday looks out for you
guys so with all of that said let's go
ahead and get started with the tutorial
okay so I've already applied my base I
just use Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and I
set it with a bone colored eye shadow
and now I'm going to go into a Nastasia
Beverly Hills shadow in orange soda this
is one of my favorite transition shades
to put into the crease and I'm applying
that with a Mac 2 to 4 and I'm just
lightly buffing this into the crease you
don't have to be super precise cuz it's
very light
I like to build this color up just a bit
too okay so next I'm taking on estancia
Beverly Hills I shout out in Sienna and
I'm gonna put that directly into the
crease with a Mac 217 this is my
favorite blending brush for precision
blending in the crease I'm just going to
take that Sienna and put it right in the
crease so I kind of like to put my brush
directly into the crease just the tip of
it kind of hold to push the brush this
way like this and blend it so that way
the product focuses into the crease but
the bristle is pushing down are blending
the crease as well and I'm taking this
all the way into the inner inner part of
my eye right here let's just lightly
taper it so that you can't see a harsh
edge here it's totally okay if you get
some of the eyeshadow on the lid because
we're going to be covering it with a
sparkly copper color so it's not going
to show okay so I want to deepen up the
crease just a bit to give it more
definition so I'm going to mix a little
bit of beauty mark bio Nastasia Beverly
eles into the crease as well without
Sienna
okay so to clean up the crease just a
little bit I'm gonna go back in with my
bone I shadow I'm just using so hard for
me to talk I'm just gonna use Blanc by
Anasazi Beverly Hills on this morphe g14
just gonna slightly use this to clean up
the brow bone area also brighten it up
because of all that blending media if
you ain't talking money
uh-uh alright so I'm just going to be
taking those two colors sienna and
beauty mark under the lash line as well
I'm going to go in with Sienna first on
this Sigma ferma shader brush looks a
little crazy because it's pretty red but
we're gonna we're going to ground that
shadow with the darker shadow so I'm
going to take beauty mark bio Nastasia
Beverly Hills on this morphe g12 brush
and I'm just going to pack that onto the
outer portion of the lower lash line
just like these
I actually want to deepen up the outer
corner of my eye just a little bit more
on the lash line so I'm going to be
taking new are by honest Aussie Beverly
Hills and you guys can take any black
eye shadow it's just a matte black and
I'm gonna put that on the same brush and
this time I'm just gonna focus it on the
outside I'm not going to bring it in
pass the brown that we put down so just
read over here oh for the lid I'm going
to be mixing two eyeshadows from
colour-pop this one is on the rocks it's
like a really bronzy color and this one
is drift and it's more of a cranberry
shade I'm first going to apply the
cranberry color one which is drift I'm
using a synthetic brush because the
texture of these eye shadows I find
works best with a synthetic brush or
with your finger place this all over the
lid my skin is so dry right now so my
under eyes up Creason so now that we've
applied a light layer of that cranberry
shade I'm gonna go in with this on the
rocks color so this combination of
eyeshadows is really pretty because it's
like kind of like a Christmas ornament
it has like gold frost now that we
finished up that lid color I'm gonna be
using a legend this is just like a
frosty highlight color similar to this
is nylon by Mac if you guys have that
I'm just going to use that with a makeup
forever brush this is the 216 on my
inner corner here I'm just going to
apply my liner and I think I'm going to
do a pretty intense winged liner today
this is the Tarte gel liner and it's
just in black and I'm using a Tarte
liner brush as well
so I just drew the line out it's pretty
rough I'm just gonna bring it back I
like to tilt my head back also cuz when
you tilt your head back you can kind of
see this part better so just tilt back
just slightly
after I've put down my gel liner you can
see it's not like quite perfect so I
like to go over it with the NYC liquid
liner I feel like it kind of just gives
it a more crisp sharp line especially
since the eyeshadow we placed has a
little bit of glitter in it liquids are
always easier to use with glitter
I'm going to take a little bit of
concealer like I usually do and this is
a morphe g20 and I'm just gonna sharpen
up that outer edge here concealer always
helps your weighing look sharp like a
whippin all right so now I'm just going
to pop on some falsies and these are
iconic spy house of lashes boom so now
I'm just gonna add a tiny bit of mascara
to my lashes just to stick the natural
lashes to the false lashes so I'm just
adding it just to the base and then I
like to take my finger and just kind of
push it so that it sticks to the lashes
alright and that is the eyes all done
before I filmed I did my foundation and
my bronzer I didn't do anything to
contour it because the eyes are already
so dramatic but I didn't want to kind of
go full on like everything so I kept it
light on the bronzer and then I'm just
going to apply a little bit of my
cracked mary lou manizer alright this is
betty betty lou manizer by the balm onto
my morphe mb2 i like to Pat it in and
then kind of dust most of it off and
just kind of put it on all the bronzy
areas of my face to give a little bit of
a glow i'm going to be taking my Tarte
pin-up girl palette this blush palette
like this and I'm going to take this
kind of peachy err color here again I'm
going to dab a lot of the product off on
my hand because I don't want it to be
too crazy
soon and then I'm just going to kind of
put that on the apples of my cheeks
and then after that I'm just going to
highlight like I usually do with my Mary
this is Mary right my mary-lou manizer
by the ball first
I like to take a little bit on the tip
of my nose just
Razia and then on the Cupid's bow
and then I'll just take this zoeva
highlight 105 brush and apply that to
the tops of my cheekbones lastly for the
lips I've been using this lip liner a
lot this month
I just have been using all over the lip
as a lipstick and this is the LA girl
endless lip liner in the color natural
I feel like this color makes your lips
look fuller
it's just that really nice Mavi
natural-looking lip color so I'm going
to first outline my lips with this and
then just fill it in
so this is the finished makeup look I
really hope that you guys enjoyed this
tutorial give it a thumbs up if you did
just write down there just give it a
nice little thumbs up and I will see you
guys in my next few bye oh my god all my
brushes are so derp derp just wipe it on
my pants</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
