so before I apply my makeup I cleanse my
face with the skin all of an enzyme
cleanser just to remove any dead skin
cells or leftover makeup next I'm
applying my derma dr. DD cream to my
face just to enhance my skin tone and I
like to apply this just in patting
motions with my fingers taking my
motives foundation quad in medium and
just patting that over any blemishes or
dark spots that I may have moving on to
the eyes I'm applying a white eyeshadow
on my brow bone for a highlight this is
the color white from the lorac Pro
palette now from the same palette I'm
gonna pick up this taupe color on my
Sigma e25 blending brush and I'm just
gonna basically use this color to map
out where all my eyeshadow is gonna go
it just gives you a little bit of depth
taking this orange shade from Make Up
For Ever this is the color number 18 I'm
gonna use the same brush and apply that
to the crease and I'm just slowly
building this color up I love this
eyeshadow because it is super pigmented
I'm gonna pick up espresso from the same
palette and I'm still using my Sigma e25
and I'm just going to apply this to the
outer V of my eye so I'm concentrating
most of the product in the outer crease
right now and then I'm just gonna kind
of sweep the color back towards my
lashline
next I'm picking up this tart eyeshadow
and the color is specific sunset it's a
really pretty gold shimmer shade and I'm
just gonna pack that on to the lid with
a Mac 239 brush before I move on to
concealer I'm gonna clean out any
fallout with these Ola Hendricks in
truth to go wipes and it's just gonna
give us a nice clean edge next apply
your favorite concealer I'm using this
NARS creamy concealer in the color
custard and I absolutely love this
concealer I can't believe I'm just now
trying it now I'm taking that same
espresso shade that we used in our
crease and a sigma small shader brush
and I'm just applying that on the lower
lash line and blending it out with the
blending brush that we've been using
throughout the tutorial to really
brighten this look up I'm taking Mac's
copper sparkle and I absolutely love
this pigment it's so beautiful I'm just
going to take that same brush and pack
that on the inner part of our lower lash
line
to give my eye an inner corner highlight
I'm taking tarts gold post eyeshadow and
just packing that on the tear duct area
now it's time for that wing so I'm using
my NYC liquid liner and I'm just going
to apply a what I thought was going to
be small wing but you know how that goes
I kept messing up so the wing got pretty
thick but it's okay I'm not mad at it so
I wanted to add an element of surprise
in this look so I'm gonna apply my nicka
K New York eyeliner just to add a touch
of shimmery glamour to the look I like
how this eyeliner is gonna kind of just
peekaboo through the black liner so it's
not too intense and of course just to
clean up that wing and make it look
really sharp I'm taking concealer on a
concealer brush and cleaning up the
edges now you just want to pop on some
lashes these are of course you guys hear
me say it every time
iconic lashes by house of lashes
now I'm taking Urban Decay's cannonbolt
mascara and I'm just applying that just
to kind of stick my lashes to the
falsies
and that is the eyes done so let's move
on to the face
I'm going to go ahead and set my
concealer with some loose powder and
then moving on to the contour I'm gonna
take my city color contour effects
palette and I'm going to use both of
these darker shades I first like to take
the lighter shade and really warm up my
skin and after I've done that I'm gonna
pick up a little bit of the darker shade
and really define all of my contours
so I'm making a pretty harsh line at
first but then you can just blend it
right out
now I'm going to just powder my t-zone
and this is max mineralized skinfinish
in medium I'm gonna use this city color
blush palette and these are all really
nice peachy shades I kind of mixed a few
of them together and I'm just gonna
apply those to the apples of the cheeks
and bring it up to the temples now it's
time to highlight those cheekbones so
I'm gonna use my whisper of guilt by Mac
and apply that just to the tops so I've
been wearing this lipstick quite a bit
lately
it's a very nice nude color with peach
undertones and this is by ardency in and
the color is Bowery I'm pretty excited
because this month's glam bag was
designed by Rebecca Minkoff pretty
awesome in my bag this month I got this
dove dry oil nourishing treatment and
I'm just gonna apply that to the ends of
my hair just to help with any dryness
then a quick way to spruce up your look
is by adding mark-anthony dreamwaves
beach spray and this is just gonna give
you those nice effortless beachy waves
but I didn't really use a curling iron
so that's pretty awesome
and that completes the look I hope you
