for today's tutorial we're gonna be
doing this makeup look right here I
really played off of bright oranges and
cranberry colors kind of slowly
transitioning into fall there's
definitely gonna be more dark vampy fall
looks coming to my channel pretty soon
so don't worry about that
this is my summer transitioning into
fall makeup look you guys are
interesting this makeup look then keep
on watching I'm gonna be using all the
stuff I'm gonna be using all this stuff
from the Ipsy glam bag this month the
first thing in the bag is the Vasanti
brighten up enzyme face rejuvenator
it's an exfoliating cleanser enriched
with papaya cuz it's supposed to help
with fine lines wrinkles and brighten up
your skin next I'm gonna use a
moisturizer to prep my skin this is the
now Bay oxygenating cream moisturizer
and it's organics it's also gonna be
like a base for our makeup next I'm
picking up the temptu liquid highlighter
and I'm gonna be mixing this with my
foundation just to give it a little bit
of do the foundation I'm gonna be using
is the Make Up For Ever HD foundation
there's gonna be applying that with a
Beauty Blender kind of breaking out
right now cuz you know
we're gonna quickly run some brow gel
through my eyebrows this one is by
Elizabeth Mott and it's the queen of the
filled tinted brow gel and medium dark
the little tiny spoolie brush kinda has
a lot of product on it and just brush
through my brows really quickly for my
brows I'm gonna be using the Anastasia
brow Wiz in caramel my eyeshadow base
I'm gonna be using the Smashbox 24-hour
photo finish shadow primer I'm gonna
apply it with this zoeva buffer brush
really quick and then I'm gonna take my
fluffier japonesque 915 brush and just
kind of buff it away into the skin my
eyebrows got a little dark today I don't
know what happened she kind of kept
messing up and then it's a pretty strong
brow I'm going into my Inglot palette
and picking up this bright orange
eyeshadow and I'm taking a 213 luxe
petit crease brush by zoeva I think I'm
gonna start on the lower lash line I
haven't applied concealer yet you guys
know I usually like to do that first but
breaking all the rules today so woing
out the orange of it what I like to do
is take like the edge of something like
this and line it up the lower lash line
on my brow and then just kind of like go
like this so I can get a good edge some
people do this with tape ain't nobody
got time for tape
I'm just gonna keep my eye open and just
start applying the shadow following the
shape of my crease looking at all the
way in the inner corner here we're just
gonna keep building up the intensity of
this orange shadow really gonna pick up
I did on accident but I kind of like it
I'm picking up some of the red from the
palette this red color right here and
mixing it with the orange just cuz I
found the orange isn't like really
getting as bright as I want it to so I'm
gonna mix those two together still
trying to keep it mostly orange though
I'm gonna pick up a cream colored
eyeshadow clean up the edges and
highlight the brow bone with it
so I put a little bit of purple on my
lid but I wasn't really feeling it so
we're gonna move on to something else
I'm gonna take a dark brown eyeshadow
this is the new lorac palette I'm gonna
be taking Cabernet and a little bit of
saddle on the same brush and I'm gonna
go through and kind of ground this neon
it looks like neon orange now on camera
I'm gonna ground it a little bit with
some dark brown just so it doesn't look
as Dombey ish so I'm just going right
underneath the orange
but with the Sigma this is the Sigma
blending 825 brush whatever is on the
brush from blending the crease I'm just
gonna blend out the lid so it has a
little bit of that orange on it I'm just
gonna kind of fuse the whole lid
together not putting any more eyeshadow
on it just kind of blending it out
because I want it to kind of look still
like skin peeking through I'm gonna use
the Kat Von D liner and trooper this
part is a little bit tricky just because
I need to draw the perfect wing but keep
the inside of the wing empty take deep
breaths here we go
I shouldn't have had that venti latte
cuz now my hand is shaking
whoa all right I still need to fill in
the eyeliner
but I'm waiting for Katie to bring me a
glitter so I'm gonna finish my face
really quick I'm using the Tarte
creaseless concealer and I'm mixing tan
a medium sand together medium sands just
a little bit lighter than tan so it's
gonna brighten it up plop it on my
under-eye trying to stay away from my
eye shadow no take my Beauty Blender and
just Pat it in this eyeliner did not
cooperate just so you know it ended up
looking slightly different I also feel
like I have less lid space on this eye
on is almost like normal just one solid
fold in the crease this one has like
multiple folds and if you notice like my
lid space is a lot smaller than on this
side so I kind of always have a hard
time making them look even when I'm
doing like a graphic liner it's going
back in with the orange eyeshadow now
that we applied our concealer and just
kind of blending it out so it doesn't
look weird and like not blended into the
concealer we're gonna set the under eyes
I'm using my Laura LARM woah just set
the under eyes I'm using the Laura
Mercier translucent powder japonesque
915 brush
I'm going to pick up a little bit of the
brown we used in the crease and just up
that on the outer part of the eye I'm
using a makeup geek defined crease brush
my bronzer today I'm going to be using
this one it is the Terra Cotta bronzing
powder in shadow 3 and to apply that I'm
using my Mac 168 brush pull my hair back
real quick my bangs so I could do my
hairline next I'm using the blush by
Sigma this one is in the shade hot spot
and this is also in collaboration with
Camilla youtuber it's perfect for the
eye lock for highlighter I'm using the
Anastasia Beverly Hills highlighter in
so Hollywood I'm gonna apply that with
my Mac 137 brush just to the tops of the
cheekbones tip of my nose along the very
very top of the bridge and on my Cupid's
bow look at her eye shadow kinda looks
the same which is so weird is that weird
considering we didn't plan it yeah and
cuz I don't wear these colors ever I
know do you think it looks good on me I
don't think I like it on me I think it
looks good actually do you think it
looks good on me I'm insisting you okay
alright so I'm gonna take some Mac
mixing medium on the back of my hand
that Katie's so graciously brought for
me and some Inglot 82 glitter it's like
a pigment it's more of a pigment it's
like goldish crushed metal I really care
about my life I love how I'm like in the
middle of a tutorial you just in the
background
oh yeah this is I'm living right now for
this all right and for the inner
waterline I'm going to use this liner by
jcat and it's in the it's a waterproof
slide on pencil in this shape bronze
ardell demi whispies I really want the
eyeliner to show so we're gonna go with
more of a natural lash so I already
popped it on this side I'm just gonna go
ahead and put it on this one lipstick
I'm gonna be using one of a kind by City
color just like a long-lasting nude
lipstick it has kind of like a peachy
pink undertone so it goes really nicely
with the rest of the colors on our face
Asli in the back we have the Octavio
Molina this is actually a friend of mine
who is amazing so this is an argan oil

ends alright guys so that is it for this
