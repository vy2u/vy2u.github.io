today's video is going to be a tutorial
on this makeup look right here I posted
a photo on Instagram and you guys loved
it you want a tutorial so here is the
wing is back the wing is back I am like
loving the wing so I'm really happy that
it's back everybody welcome it welcomed
it with open arms this is a very
dramatic makeup look it's a lot of
makeup so if you don't like a lot of
makeup then you're not going to like
this video but if you're into it if
you're into all this makeup then go
ahead and keep on watching so the first
thing we're going to do is prime our
lids I pretty much use the same primer
in every video it's the Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot look at this I have like
makeup all over my hand always then to
set the base of course I always use a
bone colored shadow this one is Blanc
but I'm estación and I'm just going to
Pat that all over the lid with a flat
fluffy brush the next thing we want to
do is really create the shape of the eye
because the shape is kind of elongated
so I'm going to use orange soda by
Anasazi at Beverly Hills and I'm just
going to swirl my Mac 217 and that this
color is light enough to where you can
really map out the shape without making
it any mistakes that you can't just
easily blend away and that's why I like
to use it so I'm going to take this and
create a V first imagine that there's a
winged liner coming out this way so you
kind of want to follow where your winged
liner would be and then also drag this
into the upper crease towards the inner
part of our eye but keep most of the
shadow on this back side so the next
shade I'm picking up is Sienna also by
almost basically every eyeshadow unless
I say otherwise is Anasazi at Beverly
Hills I just love these eyeshadows
they're better than Mac to me but a
similar one by Mac is Brown script if
you guys have that I'm going to pick
this color up with my favorite tiny
little dirty blending brush this is the
two three one picking up Siena and I'm
going to use my zoeva luxe petite crease
brush this is my favorite brush for like
outer corner work this is where you're
really going to define the shape so
we're going to keep that v
I basically use Siena and every single
makeup look I ever do fact Jeff is over
there shaking his head like yeah I just
love it it's like so pretty
now I'm actually bringing this into the
inner corner here Wow
we're gonna continue building on the
shadow like I said it's a lot of
building this is deep brown you guys can
take any really dark brown that you have
any eyeshadow will work and I'm just
going to continue using this little tiny
crease brush and basically repeat the
same steps and every time I repeat the
same step I kind of take the eyeshadow
closer into the V and closer into the
video so gradiate I'm trying to focus
this mostly right in here and also I'm
running it along my lash line right here
I always like to keep my blending brush
next to me because once I apply with
that little brush you always want to
really diffuse it out with a more fluffy
brush so in between applications I kind
of go in and diffuse it whatever's left
over on the brush you just want to kind
of feather that into the crease just so
it like fades in instead of just
stopping abruptly just always fade in
whatever's left over I'm gonna take a
little black eyeshadow a little bit of
black eyeshadow and I'm just gonna
deepen it up even more just slightly and
definitely just keep this right here
first going to apply this luck sea eye
shadow this is in the shade 181 I'm
going to apply this to the inner corner
of the eye area so I'm just first gray
da ting it from this lighter shade and
then on the lid I'm gonna take anasazi
of Beverly Hills eye shadow in China
Rose which is this really pretty cold
body eyeshadow
highlight the inner corners I'm using
mary-lou manizer by the balm cosmetics
it's a face highlighter but I use it to
highlight everything to pop that onto my
inner corners and the brush I'm using is
the Mac two to eight I love this brush
for like small detail work and you've
done the highlight yak-7 on my concealer
so I messed up but cool I have been
loving this concealer this is the
instant age rewind dude I've been on a
drugstore kick I'm going to do a
drugstore full drugstore makeup tutorial
soon
this is the age instant rewind by
Maybelline and I love it I just get the
color what color is this neutralizer
it's just the color neutralizer what I
like to do is still use this concealer
not because if it's consistency but just
because I like to use the applicator to
really sharpen up this edge but that's
all I use it for now this is the Norris
creamy concealer I'm first going to use
this to kind of like clean this up it's
really really bright for the under-eye
but I love that like really nice
highlight I do find that this dries
really nicely so it doesn't crease I
know it looks so white but it'll blend
and then on the forehead to blend that
out I'm going to use my Beauty Blender
who set that concealer I've actually
been using the this is the NYX contour
kit and I really like this banana
colored pout and I kind of put a lot of
it on but then after I'm done with my
eyeliner and stuff I dust it away so I'm
gonna put a lot of it on but I shall
dust it off afterwards guys told me you
were tired of natural makeup looks
actually you didn't tell me that but I
just figured it up and doing a lot of
natural makeup look so I'm going full on
today honey absolutely gonna give myself
a totally different face people call me
a drag queen I'm like yeah that means my
contour oh boy not offended don't think
it offends me it doesn't
so as I'm cooking as they like to call
it I'm going to apply my gel liner and
I'm using the English on liner in 77
which is just black and I usually use a
Mac 2 6-3 brush for this but I can't
find it so I'm using my pro precision
eyeliner brush since I really carved out
this edge with that concealer it's going
to kind of act as like a really nice
guide for my eyeliner so I already have
that perfect line to have to kind of
follow it
now we just gonna come back still got it
I stuck at it I thought I forgot how to
do a win for a while there I was kind of
scared I'm really thickening it up on
the outer corner but then as we go into
the inner part of the eye I'm going to
thin it out more I always like to do gel
eyeliner because I feel like for me it's
a lot more black but then to really go
over and sharpen it clean it up I use my
NYC liquid liner and this just makes it
even darker and sharper I'm gonna pop on
my lashes problem is the lashes I've
been wearing and all the photos that you
guys have requested me to like recreate
this look I've worn them like a lot of
different times so and I don't have
another pair so I'm gonna have to wear
the same old crusty pair wait these are
two different eyelashes I'm gonna have
to wear the same crusty pair these are
the House of lashes siren which are
amazing they're like really PC and wispy
the good thing about wearing eyelashes
multiple times that they're so easy to
put on because they're perfectly molded
to your eye as they're drying I'm just
going to go ahead and dust off any
excess powder that we had under the eye
here for the lower part of the eye I'm
going back in with pretty much the same
eye shadow as we used I'm just going to
start off with sienna and really warm up
that lower lash line I'm using the small
angled brush that I used earlier with a
black eyeshadow and I'm just gonna
really focus this Goody's piece here I'm
really just gonna focus this under the
lash line what's up good so once we get
into this inner part of the eye you're
gonna want to just kind of go right
under your tear duct like so let me just
show you taking this flat angle brush
and instead of going in I'm going
kind of go out and point the brush
towards the end of this part of my eye
so like that so it gives more of like a
feline feel and shape we're going to put
some bottom eyelashes on these are
precious by house of lashes and these
are also these have also been worn a few
times so they're also a little bit
crusty to really make this inner corner
pop I'm going to take a white eyeshadow
this is bites it's Katie's eyeshadow
she's sitting over there she wants
credit she wants credit for her products
yeah psycho so we're just popping this
um right here
next I'm going with this makeup forever
this is the pro bronze fusion in 35i and
I'm using my Mac 168 brush I'm just
going to really warm up the skin with
those I'm going into my auto Stassi a
contour kit I'm going to take the shade
Havana and that other warm shade I don't
know the name of and I'm going to just
really give myself a sharp so for blush
I'm going to use amber rose by Mac whole
petal
oddly I'm going to add my highlight this
is the makeup forever pro sculpting duo
and the number one this highlight is a
little bit more pinky number two is a
little bit more gold so I feel like with
all the coppery colors this one will go
better I'm using a Mac two to four I'm
gonna put that on the Cupid's bow
alright and then I'm just going to go
ahead and set my whole face with mac
fix+
so the last step to the look is the lips
I'm using my OCC lip pencil and this is
in the shade trick then on top of that
I've been using the NYX simply nude lip
cream this is in the shade honey so I've
noticed with these lip creams that they
are a little bit dry so I love the color
but I need to put a gloss on top of it
alright then on top of that I've been
using the dose of colors lip gloss and
this is in the shade undress alright so
that is the last step of the look and
this is the final look I think you guys
