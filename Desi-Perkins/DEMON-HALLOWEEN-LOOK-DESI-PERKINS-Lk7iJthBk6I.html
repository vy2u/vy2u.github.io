is gonna be my first Halloween video of
the year I wanted to do a spin on a
demon look I got a lot of inspiration
from different art pieces I found online
this is actually my main inspiration
obviously I wanted to do it different
but just like the vibe I also learned
technique on the shading from Meiji
looks and Valentine zombie video so I'll
link that down below too if you guys
want to check her out she's amazing if
you're interested then keep on watching
I need to do my brows first and because
my whole body is gonna be a different
color I'm gonna put a mixture of
eyeshadows so take a little bit of this
shadow here and a little bit of the
green this is the NYX brights palette
press it into the brow area and the
reason I'm using this powder instead of
my face paint is because I feel like my
brows are gonna go on better with a
powder base underneath opposed to a
cream or paint base which can make my
brows kind of slide around and I don't
want my brows to slide around okay and
nobody got time for this so sway just in
case after you do your brows with
patches of skin show through they're
gonna be the same color as the rest of
your body I'm going to quickly stencil
on the brows using my benefit precisely
my brow number 4
I'm gonna go quickly through this
because you guys have seen me do my
brows many times and I'm not doing
anything special for this place the
stencil kind of along the same area that
my brows hanging out at once you have
the basic shape you can just take the
stencil off and then fill in the rest
manually I'm just taking my MAC
eyeshadow base in soft ochre I'm just
gonna apply this all over the lid
putting the soft ochre on top of the
shadow we lay down actually it gives it
like a light green color which gives it
a highlight listening to music too
because I feel like with these kinds of
looks I need more of a creative
headspace but I don't like to do
voiceovers I'm compromising with half
music half not I'm gonna do that same
mixture of eyeshadows that I did around
my brow and apply those to the lid this
is a
Smith to 5/6 and then just feather it
out to the edges here take a blending
brush and sweep over that so it's not as
blue next I'm going to go into the zoeva
MACT spectrum palette and I'm going to
pick up this forest green shade and mix
it once again with this turquoise color
here from NYX powder we're gonna put
this on the crease using a Smith 230
placing that on the outer part of the
crease and i'm also gonna place it on
the outer V of the eye here now that I
have that on I'm using my Kat Von D
tattoo liner this is in trooper and I'm
gonna create a fierce wing now I'm gonna
fill that in with my England gel liner
77 just black I'm using a craft brush
from Michael's the reason I do this is
because the Inglot gel liner just looks
so dark to me it's the darkest and it
doesn't come off at all or budge that oh
now that we're done with the liner I'm
gonna use my house of lashes iconic
these are the iconic originals and I'm
gonna place those I already put this eye
on come in from above boom sticking them
on the center and then I'm gonna stick
the corners down then I'm just pinching
my natural lashes with the falsies so
they're all like one unit and I'm using
these this from Mac specifically for
eyelashes and then I like to prop them
up with my fingers after they're already
almost dry and like really really tacky
because it's gonna really open up the
eyes if there's ever a time where I want
my lashes to be extra dramatic and like
stick up really high it's during
Halloween looks if you ever bought a
pair of eyelashes that for some reason
they were too heavy for you this is the
perfect time to use them the bigger the
better
I'm thinking that I actually also want
to intensify the outer corner of the
crease just a little bit so for that I'm
going to use my melt stack black eye
shadow any black eyeshadow you guys have
I'm gonna take my small dose of colors
detail brush and I'm gonna dip it into
my black shadow
really connect the wing cheer this
crease and I only dipped into the black
shadow one time because I don't want to
be too much and also make sure that when
you lay black eyeshadow down but you
blend it all out first before you add
more to the look because that's when it
starts to get a little crazy you know
mmm-hmm
next we're gonna take a white liner
pencil and you're gonna want to take
this pencil and map out all the shapes
on your face before we paint the whole
face we're just gonna want to have like
gaping holes all up in our mouth area
we're just gonna go in there's no
specific shape I'll just try not to make
a look too
uniform make them all look different I
do one down here that just starts out
here and goes up to your drop some up
here like some tears of the skin I don't
like that get that off if you think
about drawing things with the white
pencils you could always erase easily so
if you don't like something okay bliss
now what I'm gonna do is mix some paint
so the color reference that I'm going
for is this drawing that I found here so
this is the color that I like for my
body we're gonna mix that using this
mehron palette right here this is a good
face painting palette because it kind of
just has every color this is the palette
on the inside I'm just gonna mix colors
until I get this color and this is a
water activated paint so you just need a
little bit of water and you're good to
go it was pretty close I'm just gonna
use a flat foundation brush to apply
this
what I put in the crease I'm just gonna
put that on my lower lash line really
quickly smoke that out using a blending
brush before we move on and get a little
bit Messier with the makeup because you
do want to look not I bag II but a
little bit more dead I take a black
liner and line my waterline with this
this is the Urban Decay 24 hour what a
mess I'm making here now that same green
and blue eye shadow from the NYX palette
and just smoke out that black I made a
mixture of paint for my makeup forever
flash palette right there and I'm gonna
use that to fill in all of the little
crevasses that we made using a sigma
detail concealer brush by the way I just
basically mixed like the colors that I
used on my face already with black to
get this color because I want it to be
like a darker version of it alright now
we're going to do the shading inside
these gaping holes I'm going into this
color and this color from these zueva
collet on a flat brush we're gonna start
to give these depths so anytime there's
like a curve that's where you want it to
be the darkest and then you fade around
it and then you get lighter as you go
down and I'm gonna keep all my darkness
on this side of the gaping holes so I
got inspo non-major looks channel she
has this Valentine's Day zombie and whew
I don't know how long ago she did that
but that's where I learned how to do
this part of the shading she's so good
you guys should definitely check her
channel if you have not she is like a
special-effects face painting master I'm
gonna take a black shadow and add even
more depth to these what are they gaping
holes rotting flesh I look like a zombie
right now we're going in with black here
now that we did the shading inside the
mouth we're gonna do the shading around
the gaping holes I'm gonna take a
blending brush same blue eye shadows
we've been using basically I'm just
gonna start going around every curve and
hugging the curves I'm gonna take the
same little dose of colors pencil brush
and the darker blue shade and get a
little more detailed err on these edges
I'm also gonna just hit the edges of my
face with the same blue mixtures just
like you would do your regular bronzer
I'm just gonna make sure you bring that
shading down here as well the next thing
I'm doing is taking the mayor on 3d gel
this is the same thing I used my melting
skull video last year and I crushed up
some of the shadow that I used for my
eyes it was painful but it had to be
done and what I'm gonna do is put that
and mix it with the 3d gel and hope that
it turns it the right color that I need
because we are going to drip this could
go horribly wrong it's one of those
things where I'm just totally testing
right now it was at this moment
desi that she I repeat do not mix
eyeshadow with the 3d gel I found that
it had a hard time drying once I did
that whereas in the past when I applied
it normal and painted over it had a lot
better outcome so do that instead
because this is where it went wrong for
me this is hot so you want to test it to
make sure it's not gonna burn your face
off for real look over the bus here
let's start right over here
try to manipulate it alright guys so
that is it
I am diamond I just popped on the white
contacts which I don't know people were
these I can't see anything right now at
all a black wig and some little demon
horns I hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial

rest of the Halloween videos and I'll
see you in my next video
eating it a crawl excuse me mm-hmm

trying to open it from the wrong side oh
