okay you know sure I'm sorry I I need
you to start again hey guys so we are so
excited to share this with you guys this
is something that we've been working on
for two years yes together
Jesse and I we created a makeup
collection we get rid of baby
we had a baby together with Joseph
colors this is officially our first time
seeing it on YouTube so we're almost
like we don't even know how to say it
however why we're being so weird right
now we're very nervous but we're so
excited it's a huge deal for us we've
been working on this like I said for two
years basically and literally our baby
we made a baby together we did we wait a
baby together so we actually made eight
babies together
it wasn't busy we vented so we have a
cool collection with Joseph colors and
we're so excited that we got to partner
with Joseph color we love Anna so much
and we're so excited when she came to us
to do a collection with hers and I
Porsha texted us
her and I were talking about if we could
do a makeup collab with any brand who
would be and at the same time to her and
I both said Joseph colors like we both
wanted to do the coop and then we got
the texture and as the very next day
aniseh owner of dose of colors and she
was like hey guys one of me with us and
we were like I said is there cameras in
here or was well in there like it was
too weird it was fake like how we put
out to the universe and I got the
message right away texted us and that
was history mm-hmm when we posted it on
YouTube we wanted to be able to share
all the product yet and like basically
just spill the beans on everything so
that's what doesn't hold it
yes let's really so that's what this
video is going to be we're going to be
sharing everything with you guys the
collection swatches I'm so excited
Packaging yeah and
we're going to be sharing another video
kind of talking about the journey we
went through with Anna to bring this
collection to light we're going to be
sharing that yeah the process video with
you guys later on in the week but we
wanted the first youtube video to be
like BAM here here's everything here's
some meat the meat the potatoes are
coming later yet but the meat is now
we're really really proud of everything
that we created and we're so we feel so
lucky that Anna gave us so much freedom
to just do whatever we wanted and we
think we've got some like serious hot
fire shits that we're about to drop like
staples this is like a little planning
our wedding for two years and we're
finally get our tennis balls from
literally IO or we're walking down the
aisle on your pinky and then we'll black
out for you soon yeah I think I've
already blacked out too many nervous
punch number it is dive right in do it
it was cool of eight eight items I was
like eight we have five lip products -
highlighters and an eyeshadow palette
it's so so cool baby it doesn't it yet
can we just say we've been wearing this
stuff for like the past year and a half
every time someone asks what highlighter
I'm wearing it's been this and oh my
gosh it made me feel so bad because I've
had to be like oh yeah like make just
like a bunch of stuff I felt like such
an asshole the whole time but I couldn't
like it but we're telling you now yeah
so let's start the highlight start with
our writers you have two highlighters
look at the packaging it's metallic
packaging and it's like nude rose gold
is like the whole theme for the whole
collection
yes Katie and I always wanted to create
the best highlight ever if you're
wearing the light one or a very low
light one and I'm wearing the key for
out in the white paper it's like just a
different undertone made it that way
when you put it on her skin you don't
see the cast because a lot of times if
you put highlighter on a more tan or
deeper skin tone you'll see like a white
cast on it and this doesn't have that
you can't see it you can really build it
up to make it like Oh any of Stingley
wet-looking with zooming yet
right now I thought like I even want to
put some more on you right now can I do
that go ahead I guess she said I was
enough highlighter and I wanted to put
some of the light highlighter on her too
to make it like really Moomin mm-hmm
glossy glossy so the first highlight
that we've created is called SOI go play
go that way go right now this is actual
highlighter packaging so in second as
like they're really cool
multi-dimensional if you haven't thought
of sunlight oh my gosh insane Edward
Cullen yeah and then I has the dose of
colors logo right here which a little
bit yeah everything that we did it was
just me does Ian Anna yeah like we
designed every every no like teams it
was just a neat other boys yeah literal
fixes and then you open it up and it has
a rose gold inside with a mirror and
this is what swig Oh highlighter looks
like my favorite thing about this
highlighter is I can build it up so much
and it just looks more and more glossy
it doesn't look like you're putting on
like a heavy product on your face very
smooth and it's very like Sheen glass
wet moisture Sami yes I was trying to
think of another word so I'd use about a
good one the next highlight obviously
same outside packaging and inside
packaging this is called mean ma Li
diamond look at that it's so beautiful
it's not a bronze one it's not a gold
one but it looks so good just does
whatever your skin does but makes it
brighter yeah promise you it's
neck I mean you can see it yeah I said
iron yes
Plato the next product with something
that was really important to Katie and I
because as you know we love nude it's
kind of our thing I mean who doesn't
love a good nude lipstick but for me
personally I've never really found a
nude lipstick that has the correct
undertone from my skin tone I felt like
it was always too pink a lot of these
lipsticks are very pink or too light I
always had to make some dark shades with
it or I'd have to try to blend a lip
liner so I knew I wanted to create the
perfect nude lipstick that would go with
my skin tone I did not know that it
would be the hardest thing
it is really really hard once I might
ride in that sample let's get some
mustard on me I was like oh we went
through so many this is a new formula of
lipstick to get away we arranged a
dealer's formula we want to do something
that was not too matte and like dry
looking but not too creamy this is like
the perfect in-between and we're just so
excited yet and this is more creamier
please and this goes back to our coffee
you guys know we always like to joke
about our NC 35 in our coffee being too
dark and this is the lipstick it's a
matte soft touch so it feels really
really nice and the inside also has our
signatures Katie and ions right above
each other this is the shade beautiful
it's such a good like deeper nude colors
Oh smells so good too by the way this
lipstick has more of a brownie peachy
undertone opposed to any pink or moppy
undertones it goes more towards that
yeah the other lipstick that we have
which is the lighter nude yes this one
you guys are not going to be surprised
by this at all the lumps of color just
called no shade no shade no shade we
named that like the very earth where
this was even born at home even out the
color we're like oh the lighting that's
gonna be no shame no shame for sure the
same packaging is the other one love the
tube it has like a nice weight to it
we're just we're really excited about
the way that it turned out Oh was
amazing ahead you can wear it by itself
as more like a matte finish or if you
want to throw a gloss on top of it it's
plenty next item we want to share with
you guys while we're talking about the
news finally you're already ready for it
no boom we'll another brand new for a
brand new product this is lip gloss that
we created specifically to go with our
nude lipsticks like if you want to have
a matte day you can have a matte day but
if you want to have a bloody day
spaghetti day yeah ready
you want something that looks so blocky
so like beautiful in the light has a
sparkle but isn't super chunky and isn't
sticky we want it to be like b-school
dicta on your lip
we really here it is and we named this
lip gloss over the top or as you put it
over the top of you know your lipstick
and also you are over the top of t where
the hundred percent over the top totally
over the top it looks gold and the tube
yeah that's because it has like the gold
reflex and the gold glitters in it I
don't want to say glitter because it's
not chunky at all actually wore it by
itself and my mom was in town and she
was asking me like what are you wearing
on your lips because you can just wear
it kind of like a clear block yeah but
when it's in the light it'll have that
reflection and it's so I mean we
literally wanted the impossible all the
time when you're like well if you do
that it's going to be this more like no
we need to we need it to be bit and you
know but we literally like no but we
were sitting there in the lab like add
more glitter to add more glitter and
then they would come back and it would
have more much glitter and they were
like pull back honestly it turned out
for really because you can wear it by it
by itself you wear it alone you can wear
it over lipsticks and it doesn't change
the color of the lipstick it's like a
clear gloss but it's so sparkly and
juicy since we're on the topic of
lipstick we're going to go into our two
liquid lipsticks that we created we had
to do liquid lipstick we had a dose of
colors is our favorite formula sub
liquid lipstick when deciding on the
colors of our liquid lipsticks II knew
we wanted something super bold like BAM
punched in the face colors sold with
lipstick yeah we want you to feel like
you got pushed in the face when you tell
me the first one that we have to share
with you guys is the lipstick that I'm
wearing and this is literally like we
wanted to get the darkest color we could
get without being too purple and without
we have to read it would either go one
direction or another when we were trying
to create it and we were just like it
ended up becoming like more blood more
ox blood that we everything ocelots
also an opposite like something in
between not like Burgundy so this is the
color that we have and it is called
sabab Sabah's Sauvage don't forget the
accent mark it is not a savage okay yeah
it's vosch and it's the same shape is
the dose of colors with with the same
size change the component packaging
color and then check it out and here is
how fancy it is
very vampy with the most liquid
lipsticks you have to wait till it dries
until you see like the real creamy color
of it but this one the more time that it
drives it literally starts to look like
black girls it like sexy and what's cool
about this one is you can wear it with
just a winged eyeliner you can wear it
with really minimal eye shadow and have
like more editorial oh so the next
liquid lipstick is of course hot fire I
mean come on you guys already knew that
there is a hot line and this is the most
fabulous bright red-orange
nose yondu prostitution in position boom
it is vibrant like I've also warns it in
like an Instagram picture which I tried
not to wear too many of the lip colors
on Instagram accept the news but
everyone asked it was like the number
one question and I just had to ignore
everybody when I did the Grammys evening
and when I did a meet-and-greet in Texas
I wore that that was that was kind of
stupid as MEAC because lefel were in
your face like what is that was like a
sec color top fire like it is there's no
other way to say it hot fires hot I got
fire those are all of our lip products 5
lip products we did that we did we did
that needed that alright so we have the
last thing to talk about the last thing
to talk about we talk about the girls
yeah the girl it's time to talk about
the girl I want to talk about the girls
oh this palette we call the girls cuz
the names which some of you also guessed
on Twitter of course we had to put our
babies in here there is a we're talking
about Stephen and oh yeah no there's
four eyeshadows in here and the names
are Suze is one of them yes turbos on is
another one and I have no Lee and
harpoon
so we basically wanted to name this
pallet after our little puff and we
wanted to put their nicknames so boson
is just long but a real con is like your
more formal name oh yeah her birth
certificate may be all right yeah behind
this pallet would say you're getting
ready that night and you're like I want
my eyes to pop so I want four standout
shades that are going to be great for
fire absolutes
yeah you want able to ask what's on your
eyelid I mean are you asking Ariel
that's one I shadow on the lid that's
not a reflect on their outer glitter
that was our thing we knew that we could
have made an eyeshadow palette that had
matte shades transition shades things
like that but we go to the same matte
eyeshadows we have our transition shades
that we stick to as many new pilots come
out we're still really all about our
like own transition colors that we like
and we really just wanted to make this
stand out I'm going to go make my eyes
pop so let's unveil it shall we
all lower all these are the four shades
and of course we wanted to pick two that
Katie and I like wear all the time and
one thing we wanted to share with you
guys was the formulas of shadow they're
not your standard formula eyeshadows we
recommend using your finger to apply all
of these shadows first of all it's going
to get the best outcome for sure and
then two of these shadows in here you
can use dry and then the other two
shadows are actually designed to be used
wet so when you use the other two
shadows which is suits and harpoon make
sure you have a little bit of water it's
super easy to do like honestly like one
drop of water on your finger and dip it
into the eyeshadow pan and then you
glide it on and it literally turns it
into like a liquid metal so these are
the four shades and of course we wanted
to pick two that Katie and I like wear
all the time
you guys already know I had to have a
bronze shade I don't care how many brown
shades are on the market I needed to
make the perfect bronze shade I feel
like on my skin tone they always end up
looking orange E and I don't like the
way that I know they're gonna come
anything I've ever worn yeah so I just
have to be away from it but this one is
like I love wearing my wig like it was
so pretty
this one is no ly all the colors
actually match the dog's colors Dadu in
a way she's the perfect bronze shade and
she has the most beautiful gold reflex
that you will ever see does he was
wearing it and I was just staring at her
eyes because the formula is so smooth
that's a snow lee jeongae only beautiful
perfect broader face normally the
lighter kind of more champagne peach
color is too
there's mpz i mean whatever you want to
call it but this is Susie for this color
we really wanted to do something that
was going to be really bright on the lid
pleased to wear this all over the lid if
a video that we did together talking
about like their journey with the
collection I have it on the lid if you
pop it right here I'm gonna be adventure
all right on the lid and today I'm
wearing it on the inner corners yeah and
it's like such a good inner corner like
a like where we love it so much and
going along with every eyeshadow look in
the inner corner so for this particular
formula this one and harpoon which we're
going to talk about in a second they
have their they're meant to be used wet
hmm literally I dip my finger in a dot
of water and then put it on the shadow
and just like glide it on your eye and
it looks so good and today what I did
for the inner corner is I got a pencil
brush wet and I dip it into the
eyeshadow and then put it on so Sue's is
the wet formula and then harpoon is a
wet formula and this is harpoon right
over here you guys isn't this the most
beautiful looking eyeshadow me unlike
any other color
I've personally ever seen money we'd
always say this one looks like dirty
money money if you try really hard to
look at if you do a heavy swatch it
looks like it's almost like a cool tone
green base and it has like a greenish
gold reflection to it if you've been
looking at it you can kind of see the
cooler grays and greens in there and
then it has like a green gold reflection
which I love green gold this is the one
that we were just like we want something
that we've never seen more totally
different never been ever been ever it
is the last ones turbos on like gross is
what I'm wearing right now this is
literally just bending it no no moisture
no wetting it Janelle really just
patting it on the lid even when I still
swatch it I cannot believe that it has
that strong base color and glitter and
glitter on top even want to look at it
now I'm just like damn and that took us
a long time to get there where was that
base color was really really strong
because we didn't want it to have to be
like you had to put an eyeshadow
underneath that you're a base underneath
it and you can literally just pack it on
your eye if you do like a cool crease
color like she
a warmer crease color and it looks so
good you guys have no idea how proud we
are of this like we worked so hard to
make sure that we could get what we
wanted and I swear how many people feel
this like you can't have a strong
underbase if you want all that glitter
it just doesn't work but we made it
happen and it worked and it looks
incredible like so there's our oh yeah
this is this is our girls palette and
specifically harpoon and Sue's you know
our old birds yeah they're the ones we
want to use with water they'll get you
definitely want to use it with water or
else your novels fall out yeah and
you'll see like if you swatch it it's
going to be a little bit more powdery if
you don't have water but if you use just
literally the tiniest amount it turns
into like liquid metal throw us on and
Olli are just like literally just slide
it on you're ready to go blowing it on
that is our full collection that we
created with those with colors the whole
