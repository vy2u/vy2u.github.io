today's video is going to be a very
exciting one mostly for me but hopefully
for you as well because I finally get to
do a makeup tutorial using the desi xkt
dose of colors collection I have been
waiting for so long to use this
collection you guys have no idea I've
been constantly filming and thinking
only I had the perfect nude lipsticks
that would go with this but I couldn't
use ours the highlights are just
everything in general I've been dying to
use it on camera and I'm so happy that
today is finally here where I will be
doing a tutorial using our products our
babies I'm so happy I can't stop smiling
I hope you guys enjoy this video this
was kind of requested this eye makeup
look this is what I wore in our
swatching video in our collection reveal
video and all of you guys wanted to see
a tutorial I have turbos on on the lid
Sivaji on the list and of course I'm
bathed in our highlight and I also read
the comments and saw you guys wanted to
see the nude lipsticks on my skintone
since the swatches in the video were on
Katie so I will swatch both nude
lipsticks at the end of the video and
you'll get to see this whole look with a
nude lipstick as well so let's go ahead
and get started first I'm going in to
the Urban Decay Naked heat palette and
I'm going to be taking the color soft
which is this one right over here I've
been using this a lot as a transition
shade lately and I'm using a Mac two to
four and I'm going to apply it right in
my upper crease it kind of lifts my eye
up because you know sometimes our lids
are down like this you see that you
can't really get the right shape but
when you go like that there she is
I only do it when I have the transition
shade because after that I feel like I
get the exact guide then you just want
to build up the color here I'm actually
also going to be blending this in the
outer part of the eye as well I feel
like it's been a hot minute since I've
been here filming an actual makeup
tutorial on myself basically I've been
pre filming with Katy for the launch
then I filmed a video with Kim which
will be up soon and all of which I have
not been doing my makeup on camera
it's always like either I did her makeup
or I did makeup before filming a
transition shoot for me is always pretty
standard and all my looks it just makes
everything so much easier to do just
diffuse it out in this outer corner here
next I'm going into the shade in Slagel
it's a really pretty plum color I'm just
going to use the same brush Mac 224 so
when you do smoky eyes you always want
to start with the lightest shade and
then slowly build on the lightest shade
to darker and darker and then the
darkest you want apply last because
that's what's going to give you that
really pretty gradient I think I need to
get a smaller brush to really pack the
pigment I'll be using a Smith 230 see
how that now targets the area a lot more
it's putting the same plum shade right
here on the outer V of the eye as well
probably extend this a little bit go
into ashes this is more of a whole tone
deep deep plum I start with this in the
outer corner of the eye because that's
where I know I want everything to be the
darkest and then I bring it on to the
outer corner and just circular motions
out here remembers left over on my brush
after I've applied all the pigment I
start to feather it out this way and it
doesn't have to be perfect because once
we clean it all up with concealer it's
going to look sharp I want actually
deepen it up slightly even more than
that shade was giving me the ash one I'm
going to go into the dose of colors
baked Browns and take this deep dark
brown I shall be using a 235 by Smith
cosmetics because it has a nice fine
point taking the outer corner and
smoking it out whatever is left on my
brush going in to my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot I'm taking this Urban Decay
flat concealer brush and we're going to
cut just the face so I just lay it down
and swipe down I would go slow with this
process because you don't want to mess
up everything you've done it's going to
give you that cut crease effect without
actually having to do the cut crease
work thank you the difference this lid
this lid when you get to these edges
over here when it gets more dark into
the show
to feather it in to what you've done and
then we could blend shadow on top of it
over here I'm just taking a brush and
feathering out those edges and if you
want to pick it up with a little bit of
the transition color that we used in the
crease to do that to feather it out so
happy to be filming again you guys I
think it's nice sometimes to kind of
pull back and refocus and I'm so like
inspired now and ready for Halloween I'm
ready for just I'm ready to sue okay
let's get for now we're about to put the
lid color on the star of the show here's
the palette so pretty this is turbo Sun
we wanted to make sure that the base was
super pigmented along with having a
crapload of reflux we wanted it to just
be so sparkly we had a really really
strong vision for a turbo something and
it just came out perfect I'm going to
apply this with my finger because it has
so much reflux it just applies better
that way and it glides on a lot nicer
swirling my finger into it and I kind of
like hit it with a pat and then a swipe
and then should get into that fine
detail work closer to the cut crease I'm
going to use a flat concealer brush oh
yeah so we have two standard formulas in
the palette that you don't need to use
water or anything they look great as is
and then we have to wet formula
eyeshadows in the palette and when you
buy the palette it gives you a little
guide when you use the wet formulas you
just need a little bit of water on your
finger and then you tap it into the
palette enter boson is one of the
formulas that does not need to be
applied wet it's just good as is I want
to really deepen up the outer V I'm
going back into that dark brown shade
and a small little mac to 2:8 start
packing it on the very outer V of the I
want to make that nice little smell okay
take it a makeup why but it's going to
dust off any eyeshadow also clean up
this edge I'm going to go ahead and
apply mascara this is the l'oreal
voluminous lash dice we're going to put
some of this on before the lashes I'm
going to use my good old trusty iconic
these are the original iconic and I'm
using the lower lashes lash applicator
which is so good it like has the right
angles to put on the lash now we have
our lashes on let's finish the rest of
the face makeup and I will finish the
eyes we're going to apply our foundation
I've been using the Dior forever skin
lately this is in the shade
0:41 apply this to my Beauty Blender
this covers everything
for concealer I'm going to be mixing can
from colour-pop with medium from
colour-pop I've been wearing them
recently this one's a little bit darker
and I put it on first because I feel it
kind of hides like any tiredness because
it has a lot of peach undertones and
then I mix it with a little bit of the
medium to brighten it up blend that in
with my Beauty Blender I always get so
excited to try either foundations or
concealers or highlighters I think for
sure face products or my favorite thing
to test out when I get any packages from
brands actually I think I'm going to put
a little bit of the tan over here to you
because I do have some pigmentation in
this area needs extra coverage excellent
excellent
I'm also going to use that light shade
just right down the center of the nose
and a little here you know on the chin
these are just highlight areas so I'm
just using the lighter shade I'm going
to go ahead and set my under eyes with
Laura Mercier translucent powder and
along the sides of the nose to send out
the nose there in a full face and makeup
today I'm just going to go ahead and
dust it all off with a clean brush so
set my face makeup I'll be using the
Charlotte Tilbury powder this is in two
medium kind of going to push it into any
where I get oily and the center of my
forehead but I'm not going to put any
where it's at highlight lightly where
I'm going to contour low again I love to
use this japonesque brush for bronzer
it's just a large fluffy dome shaped
brush and today I'm going to be using
this bronzer right here this is the
Guerlain in the shade oh five this is a
slightly warmer deeper bronzer than
hoola bronzer and that's why I'm using
it because I want a little bit more of a
warm toned glow shoot I usually put my
highlight on first you know and let me
do that kind of played myself here
so we're going to do the highlight first
and that's something I'm
really excited about look I have my two
samples here so these are two
highlighters that we have Flay go and
meet um a title is a lighter highlight
of the to me diamond is a little bit
more of a deeper highlight I use meta
made but I also can pull off swag Oh
even though it is lighter this one
doesn't have a higher glow than this one
they both blow crazy like super Beeman I
would say this one's good for fair to
medium and then this one which is me
Tama is good for medium to deep first
I'm going to apply meat on it I'm taking
that on a fan brush then i'm going to
start lightly applying it
I mean thinner and taking it up like a
c-shape over here look at that boom what
I really love about these highlights is
there's no big chunky glitter I like
something that looks more of a sheen
very very wet very dewy and natural glow
I mean obviously it's not natural
because there should have been a control
wait I like to take a brush and kind of
blend the edges to make sure
everything's nice and seamless am I
going too far just tell me that it's
really it's really crazy like it looks
natural but it's so powerful of the
things I look at that then I'm going to
go ahead and use swagga which is the
lighter of the two on the tip of the
nose dumb center on the Cupid's bow all
right and since we're here might as well
sort of a little bit of this in my inner
corner I actually ended up putting some
of my collar bones and my shoulders as
well and a lot of people ask me how I
get my body to glow I do different
things all the time but in the pictures
from the launch party
I put Mizzy all over my body and then
down the center of my legs shoulders all
the Centers were like hits I took our
highlight and I just like everywhere I
go back into the bronzer that we started
off with before we realized it was a
mistake to do bronzer before my
highlight I'm going to go ahead and
finish bronzing the skin can go ahead
and hug the highlight here get into that
hairline like to shorten the forehead
with a little bronzer here
for blush I'm going to be using
Maybelline fit me blush in coral coral
is it actually called coral coral or
does it just say coral twice that's all
I need to know check out on another
japonesque brush bring a little light
into our look here I'm going to use
hoola bronzer by benefit to contour the
nose I'm just using a Smith's 2 3 5
blending brush because it does have that
nice fine little tip and then when I do
my nose contour I also will lightly
blend it up into the inner brow because
I like there to be a nice smooth shadow
there as well because naturally you have
a shadow there but finishing touch to
this look is going to be the lower lash
line and that is pretty easy
I'll just going into the transition
shade I'm going to smoke out the lower
lash line with that first maybe take a
fluffier brush this is my favorite it's
the dose of color pencil brush and it's
going to look red and crazy you will
hardly be able to see the red after
telling my brother and everybody like I
can't believe this is all happening
everything is happening so quickly and
so fast it's like your wedding day when
everything just goes by really fast
you've been planning forever and then
the day comes and it's like who just
spending time with my family and then
being here for everything so nice we
have this picture of all of us asleep on
the bed like we all fell asleep on my
mom's guest bed together it was just the
cutest picture ever I love it so much
dipping into the n Fuego color that
purpley color I want to make it a little
bit more plummy under here when I do the
lower lash line I always have a big
fluffy blending brush nearby so I could
just use the edges as I go so it doesn't
get too out of control okay now we're
taking the darkest color which is a B
Brown from the baked Brown you want to
Pat it so you get no fallout blend out
the connection here between these two so
I'm just using Roche urban decay pencil
this is like a brown pencil but it
really brings out purple tones for my
lower mascara
I like the Mac extended play this has
been really nice because it has that
really tiny little wand so I'm going to
go ahead and apply
that's my lower lashes real quick
honestly I need to do this off camera
because I'm going to cover my face at
Sameer anyways alright so this is the
face makeup everything's done except the
list but I always line my lips with oak
liner by Mac especially what I do new
we're going to start with no shade
it's the lighter of the two nudes I
would wear this more with a darker lip
liner and blend it into the nude if I
wanted a super super nude lip now it's
time for more creamer please this nude
is everything to me this one has more of
a brownie peachy undertone opposed to a
pinky undertone
this is our baby I'm so happy that we
created this lipstick obviously I love a
nude lipstick but I think I really want
to also put on Sivaji for you guys and
use that as my finished look lip color
because I want to be bold so I just line
my lips with Mac night Moss lip liner
and now I'm going to put on
Subash not savage Savage it's super dark
rich creamy luxurious velvety I love
this color so so much give it to me
alright guys so that is it for this
tutorial
it's so exciting to finally be doing a
makeup video with these products thank
you guys of course for all the support
the tweets just with everything Katie

express that enough I cannot wait till
