so today I have a very special guest
this is Cindy say hi she is my brother
marques girlfriend marki is a brother
who does not let me snapchat him so you
guys have not seen him yet the video I
did with my other brother was Danny so
you know the roach yes
the parasite I decided to do makeup on
Cindy because she does have a different
complexion than me and I wanted to use
some of our collection on her so if you
have fair skin she just happened to be
at my disposal so I'm like I'm like
you're doing it basically it was like
hey so tomorrow what I need you to film
this video with me thank you
she's been really cool about it and I
really love how everything looks on her
you can see both the lips on us now if
you could imagine hot fire with like
more of a simple I just mascara oh my
gosh like just a little highlight on the
lid but I had to go and do a craziest
bronzy smokey eye because I needed to
you guys yes I did get care we're gonna
do is makeup tutorial so let's go ahead
and get started first I'm gonna prep her
skin I want her to be like extra glossy
extra hydrated luminous show so we're
gonna be using the Mac prep and prime
essential oil so cold it's good for the
skin she says she has dry patches in her
highlight area we're going to make sure
they're nice and hydrated
we're gonna take a brows stencil I'm
gonna give her a little bit of a fuller
brow this is just gonna help me get the
perfect shape I'm using a cobra pencil
by benefit and the shade number for that
gave us like a really quick easy shape
and now I'm just gonna go ahead and fill
in lightly the sparse areas now I'm
gonna take some Cabrales is also a
number 4 on an angled brush and just do
some little feathery strokes we're gonna
put a little soap through the brows
helps all the brow hairs stand up and I
want her to look really spiky gosh what
does it like to have brows I just I
would like to know I'm gonna take a
little bit of shape tape and the shade
light beige and I'm just gonna use that
on a small concealer brush to clean up
underneath the brows to give the bottom
brow a really nice clean crisp look but
the top is gonna stay nice
feather he I'm using a dose of colors
concealer brush so Cindy give me the
juice on my brother you good the cheese
man if you guys don't know my brother
Marquis which he doesn't another never
seen never seen on camera he will not
take pictures or be on social media
which I respect just know that he exists
and he's always in the area he takes all
my pictures for me Steven used to take
them all back in the day but no we've
evolved he says damn shade Stevens gonna
see that I might as well just take the
shape tape and use it as an eyeshadow
base as well covers like any
discoloration cuz it's so full coverage
any veins so you have a nice blank
canvas you have so much lip space your
real estate is just insane here a lot of
real estate going on with you I'm going
into the LC minimalist palette here I'll
see cosmetics I'm taking the bone shades
the lightest shade in the palette I'm
just gonna use this to set the base
mostly here at the top right under the
brow bone and then take it down you guys
have met my other brother he did the
YouTube video with me that was Danny
he's a ham for the Kim mm-hmm he loves
the camera tries to act like he doesn't
but I mean it's not very good artists
I'm gonna pick up fawn by a BH on a Mac
two to four we're gonna put this in her
crease don't see you look at me
mm-hmm-hmm goes look down look that way
look up look just kidding
Cindy is the one who I used for my
over-the-top lip gloss video those were
these lips right here juicy all natural
so we're just swirling this into the
outer V of her eye as well now I'm going
into the makeup Mario palette and I'm
taking Violetta
just a rich dark brown I'm gonna apply
this on the outer V first where I want
it to be the most
okey put it in the corner and start
doing circular motions I'm gonna go into
the inner corner too with a little
darkness because I would like this to be
a little bit super sultry somewhat
editorial if you will blend this into
your crease here so I like to pack on
the shadow and then take a blending
brush and really blend it out because I
want the intensity to stay pretty
pigmented every time I do someone else's
makeup by the time I'm done I will
literally have 20 brushes in my hand
like I don't put them down I just keep
stacking them into my hand I don't even
notice it now I'm gonna go ahead and
take our desi xkd eyeshadow palette oh
my god this is actually one of my
samples it doesn't even have the dose
thing on it yet this is like the one
I've been using for a hot minute I'm
gonna take Noli here which is the bronze
shade I'm gonna apply it with my finger
we're gonna hit that center of the lid
area here bronze it up this is like the
perfect bronze shade it has a lot of
really pretty reflex in it you're in
light it just looks so pretty love all
the real estate you got going on here I
just say this is more of like a good day
shade or a Night Shade
honestly it depends on the shadows you
use with it I would put this all over my
lid for a daytime look and then just
buff out the edges but it's like depends
on who you're talking to - you know cuz
this to me I'd this is like a daytime
look for me but for you you know you're
a little bit more like I'm a mascara
chick you know gloss like all relative
orange soda by a BH this color right
here on a clean Smith - 3/5 and I'm
gonna lightly buff out these edges of
the shadow - alright so now we are going
to do her face makeup I'm gonna be using
the Dior forever skin foundation her
shade is 15 but I'm gonna dilute it
heavily with the matte gold light
because her skin is so beautiful already
I don't really need like a super full
coverage look just a little coverage
here and there so I mix it on a little
dish and you just mix it all together
it's been such a hot minute since I last
wore foundation using a zoeva 1:10 face
brush to just kind of apply the product
first we're just trying to kind of even
out the skin tone but not have super
coverage I was about to grab your ear I
know I was with you like I don't know
why I have the tendency to do that like
I have to be anchoring myself on a part
of your face when I was doing Kim's
makeup I incurred my eye like literally
was holding her hair at one point I was
like why am i holding your hair cuz it
was in the way but then I forgot to like
remove my hand off guard I was just
there
I love the freckles so do I that's why I
stopped wearing foundation yeah that's
why it's good to die with if you don't
like to wear a lot but sometimes you
want like you know some a little
coverage or even more evening out I like
to apply it with a brush and then blend
it with the Beauty Blender only because
since the foundation is already so sheer
if I dip it into the Beauty Blender it
kind of soaks up a lot of the product so
I like to kind of get an even spread
going then pounce it into to chigan it
so I'm mixing light medium and fair
beige from the shave tape concealers and
I'm gonna apply a little bit of that
mixture just a tiny bit under the guise
and I'm using a morphe oh my god
everything it doesn't have a name
anymore so used it's a little morphe
synthetic blending brush I need to set
your under eyes do you see your injuries
no yeah I didn't think so
you don't even know what creasing is yet
going back into fawn I'm gonna do her
lower lashline look up for me starting
on the outer part of the eye we're gonna
lightly smoked her lower lashline I've
had friends ask me like oh does but it
does the effort do your makeup like when
you go out no you're like no Bish's
gonna do eye makeup I don't ever do like
anyone's makeup anymore but I like doing
it you know when I'm not in a rush like
this is fun for me
bunny cuz I was gonna do like more of a
light eye and like a really bold lip and
I kind of just like
all of a sudden I just went somewhere
else
I just got carried away because it was
like that space I have so much real
estate I was like whoa I'm taking the
Marc Jacobs I pencil in Coco look up are
you sensitive mm-hmm I guess yeah I
won't about to go deep into your eyeball
okay yeah yeah you're good we're almost
done with this one
good mm-hmm
you're good at this I see you do it
every day
Tarte lights camera lashes be going into
the new cap on D shade light palette
it's the cream contour we're gonna see
if one of these shades is suitable let's
see I think I'm gonna try this one I
want you to be very contoured it's going
in with a light hand and I'm using a
dose of colors brush and I always have
the you do blender on deck you know just
in case to clean up those edges
well like contour of the nose yeah how
was this like bump tiny little bump in
the middle and I was 12 years old
and how did you get that um you know
those like portable DVD players up the
screen on it
mm-hmm I was babysitting my cousin and I
wedged it in between like some bars of a
bunk bed and we were watching the Polar
Express and she started dancing and it
fell out and it felt right smack on my
nose ever since then I don't really
notice anything I'm gonna go in to Fuego
highlight dose of colors does he ex
Katie wait you know what first I'm going
to plus sometimes like to spray with
fix+ first and let it dry and just
before it's about to dry then you hit it
with some highlight I'm using an a b h8
n brush
starting off small i'ma hold like moving
your head like yeah yeah okay as you can
see if she's fair-skinned there you go
Wow I always like to melt it into the
skin a little more with the Beauty
Blender I'm gonna put a little bit on
the tip of the nose
um this part of the bridge not all the
way down I'm just gonna put it right
here pull it on the Cupid's bow I want
you to look do way this is my favorite
part
I swear brows on adding highlight is my
favorite part of amigo got to look like
a greased piggies basically what I'm
trying to get you to look like a
beautiful one always have to hit it with
a Beauty Blender after I mean I usually
do because you know you don't want to
look crazy outside now I'm gonna take a
damp pencil brush I wet it with just
water and I'm gonna dip into Sue's which
is this light peachy champagne shade and
this is a wet formula from our palette
so you do want to use it with water
gives it a metallic finish
it's that was a little too fluffy I like
a more precise application so I'm
blending it out
do the doo doo
be one with the dew bathe in it I'm just
gonna go ahead and you know mean to a
donut yeah we're gonna do a crazy red
lip okay cuz we don't got time with you
