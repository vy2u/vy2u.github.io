show us dizzy bet akin to this rather
one time where Steven used to sneak into
your bedroom Steven never snuck into my
bedroom yeah he did yeah I caught him in
the act
yeah yeah can mean a lot of different
things to people on the internet to be
more specific because that's frightening
to me the truth comes up I remember one
time when we lived together on our old
family house Steven would sleep over but
I would try to like sneak him out you
know so I didn't get caught and our
rooms were next to each other and c1
would climb out the window to the
backyard and one time he was like
halfway out of the bedroom window and
Danny woke up and he went outside of his
room and what did he do I was like wow I
got you yeah he was like this little kid
me like I caught you and he was like
screaming so that my mom would hear and
come down like what a little snitch I
was like you'll be on my team
yeah we're gonna get those under eyes

you need to I can blink oh yeah I think
I cannot laugh when I'm putting the suit

brothers hated him because Steven pissed
me off once and I was mad at him and I
remember saying like if he comes to the
house nobody better answer the door like
nobody comes to the door nobody let him
in and Danny would answer the door and
just shut the door in his face like I'm
like oh you gram and he was low
