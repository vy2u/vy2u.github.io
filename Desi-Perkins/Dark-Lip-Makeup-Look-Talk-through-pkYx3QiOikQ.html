back to my channel so today I decided to
do this look that was really dark and
definitely not summer at all I was
inspired by a friend of mine her name is
Kelsey Alexandria I'll link her
Instagram in the description box
she just has like these really beautiful
big lips and she was wearing a dark
vampy lip on her Instagram and I just
kind of got really inspired by it I know
Khloe Kardashian did it look like this
not too long ago and everybody went like
bananas like Kylie Jenner banana also if
you notice my henna my friend crispy
also known as crispy makeup here on
YouTube did this for me I think it's
really good I love it yeah we actually
filmed it on her channel so she's going
to be posting a video of that soon if
you're interested you better check out
her channel so that you don't miss out
on that but yeah anyways I hope you guys
enjoy the tutorial and let's get started
I'm going to start by applying this
bareMinerals cream shadow to the lid and
I'm going to use this as a base this is
really good to smooth out fine lines and
it's also going to prime our lids for
our shadow it's going to take my finger
and blend this out and this is in the
shade barely nude okay so now I'm going
to go in with the color cream and this
is from the Anastasia lavish palette and
I'm just going to apply this all over
the brow bone and down to the crease
just to highlight that area a bit and by
doing this it's also going to make it a
lot easier to blend our crease shadow
next I'm going to go in with the color
orange soda and this is from the
Anastasio lavish palette as well I love
this color so now on a damp brush I just
wet it with some fix+
I'm going to go ahead and pick up the
color summer honey and this is a Mac
pressed pigment and by wetting the brush
it's going to make the color appear more
vibrant as you can see it looks really
pretty and sparkly this only works with
pressed pigments or any shimmer type of
shadows this does not work with matte
eyeshadows so I want to deepen the
crease just a little bit more I'm going
to go in with Sienna this is also from
the lavash palette it's also a deep warm
red shade
so I'm going to keep with that really
warm tone and apply that into the crease
I'm just going to go ahead and drag this
color out as I blend it through the
crease just so you can't really see
where it starts or stops it just sort of
fades out so I want this look to be even
more vampy so I'm going to use this
Inglot shadow in the color 50 it's just
a red eye shadow I'm going to pop this
into the crease again I'm using a lot of
eye shadows because I'm not really sure
what I shadow look I'm doing I just kind
of going with the flow so now that I've
added all those colors I'm going to go
back into orange soda with a giant
fluffy brush this is the Mac two to four
and I'm just going to kind of wash that
over the edges just to make sure it's
nice and diffused so I decided that I
want to add even more eye shadow to the
look so I'm going to go in with truffle
from the lavish palette as well and I'm
going to target this directly into the
crease right here just deepen it up kind
of overdoing summer looks that's why I
decided to do like the most vampy fall
look I could think of so I'm bringing
that all the way from the outer to the
inner part of our eye really giving us a
round shape this is going to make your
eyes look a little bit more deep set if
you do this if you already have deep set
eyes and you don't want to accentuate
that then just keep the darkness on the
outer part of the eye so before I finish
off the rest of the eye look you guys
know I like to do my concealer before I
do the lower lash line so I'm going in
with this motives quad in the shade
light and I'm just going to pop that on
to the under eyes and I actually have
not done my foundation yet but it's okay
when I do my foundation I'll just blend
it around the concealer and I'm applying
this with a concealer buffer brush from
zoeva I posted a post about these on my
Instagram and they are really nice
brushes I really like them a lot of you
guys asked me for reviews I'm telling
you now there
really good quality so I'm going to take
my Mac 217 blending brush with the color
Sienna and I'm just going to really buff
that under the lash line and it's going
to be released
smoky I'm going to go into the Anastasia
Emory Z palette and I'm going to pick up
deep plum I've been on this kick where I
don't wear winged liner lately which is
crazy because there was a time in my
life where I literally had to wear
winged liner every day for years I
didn't feel comfortable without a wing
but lately I've been loving not having
one I don't know the wing was my
security blanket
and lately I've let it go still love it
though
so you guys the trick to any eyeshadow
is really just adding little by little
and then blending it out and you could
always go in with a blending brush and
blend edges like right here kind of made
a little bit of a harsh edge but I can
just blend it away so I'm going to go
ahead and take an eyelash curler and
curl my lashes before I apply my false
eyelashes as I'm going to apply some
mascara and this is the pure minerals
waterproof mascara mascara is a smudge
proof so I pretty much only tend to go
for mascaras that are smudge proof I
don't see why there'd be any other kind
okay so now I'm going to apply my false
lashes and these are from flutter lashes
they're called Roxy they're not quite
corner lashes and they're not quite full
lashes so you can kind of put them in
the center or on the outer corner
depending on your eye shape but these
are really perfect for my eye shape
because they're super small and so a lot
of lashes don't usually fit and these do
so I'm just going to pop them on and
since we don't have eyeliner I'm going
to make sure to get them really close to
the lash line I'm going to push them up
with my finger because I want them to
kind of go up more
all right so now I'm going to take these
at tiny little bottom lashes and these
are from these actually are from Japan I
don't know what they are because it's in
Japanese that my mom brought them to me
from Tokyo so I'm just going to kind of
use some tweezers and slide them under
my little baby lashes and then once you
have them on make sure you push the
lashes upwards so that they come out
instead of go down flat to your face I'm
going to use this color by Mac it's
called honey lust and it's kind of like
a melon colored pigment it's not really
too bright so I think it'll go good with
these shadows I'm just going to kind of
pop it on right here nothing too
dramatic because I think my usual
highlight is nylon by Mac but I think
that would be a little too much with all
the warm tones going on I wet the brush
a little bit with some fix+ I'm just
going to kind of brighten it a look oh
yes now it's better I'm going to
actually put that under my brow bone as
well because it's so pretty now we have
the eye look done
you guys can see like some of my lash
glue is still drying over it's okay
it'll all turn clear when it's fully dry
now that we finished our eyes it's time
to move on to the face the reason I do
my face after the eye shadow is because
I kind of want to have my foundation on
the least amount of time as possible I
already applied my concealer so I'm
going to use my hello flawless
foundation now and this is by benefit
this foundation is so good it covers
really well and it gives you a dewy
finish and I'm going to use my Sigma
round kabuki brush I'm just going to
buff that in it like throws me off to
see my hand with all this henna tattoo
on it I keep thinking there's like
eyeliner eyeliner on my hands because
when I do my makeup I have like a crap
ton of eyeliner on my hand at the end of
the at the end of the session I also
like the bare minerals bare skin
foundation and the Revlon Colorstay
those are my top three right now the
Giorgio Armani luminous silk is really
nice too but it's so expensive that it's
like ain't nobody got time
at it it's like $70 a bottle or
something
so now that my foundation is done I'm
going to set my foundation I'm just
going to use this mac studio finish or
what is that Studio Fix this is actually
a powder foundation but I can't really
find my powder so do my baby hairs are
like out of control today and I want to
set my under eye concealer so I'm going
to use the contour kit by honest hacia
and I'm just going to take the shade
here here which is banana banana I'm
going to put that under the eyes just
kind of Pat it lightly I'm going to take
this pop Sunkist bronzer and I'm going
to apply this to the hollows of the face
and anywhere the Sun would hit because
I'm going for a vampy look I don't
really want to wear blush I don't think
I like the look of just like bronzer
with a dark lip and like really warm
eyes and also they're having a party out
there
some glad you guys like my longer videos
it makes me feel good I thought you guys
were going to say that you like short
videos I think deep down it would have
hurt my feelings I'm going to go ahead
and use the city color trio all of these
trios are amazing so a lot of you guys
were asking me which one I was using I
think I was using one but I also really
like too so I'm going to pop that just a
little bit right here so I'm also going
to apply that highlighter here I'm going
to apply it to the tip of my nose and
blend it out so I'm going to apply mac's
lip pencil in the color night moth I'm
going dark with this lip you guys really
dark so Oh what the heck what the heck's
going on with this lip pencil it like oh
good well it's gonna work I guess let's
see
you guys so really quick story I can't
even talk talk to you guys can undo my
lip liner but like so crispy did my
henna on my hand and lost and she told
me to sleep with a sock over it so it
didn't get everywhere and I thought it
was dry and I was being a total rebel
and I slept with out a sock on it and I
got henna like right here that dark spot
on my lip and I cannot get it off so now
I'm screwed okay oh I just wanted to
show you guys a cool trick so wearing a
dark lip is kind of tricky so a trick
that I know people do on the red carpet
makeup artists do this all the time is
they apply and lip tint underneath the
dark lip that way if the lipstick tends
to fade away the lip tint will always be
a base underneath and it's always going
to be really dark so I'm applying this
Elizabeth Mott tint and sass and this is
in the color cherry you can apply this
to your lips or your cheeks but I'm not
a fan of the cheek things this is like
really dark it's like really dark I'm
just going to let that dry for a little
bit and then I'm going to apply my
lipstick okay so I'm taking this melt
lipstick in the color
six-six-six
since I had this henna my hands are like
kind of dry I don't know what it is it
like dried out my hands so I'm going to
use at this faith aroma theat how many
is those five are all muffin this faith
aromatherapy lotion just to kind of
moisturize my house I hope that doesn't
take it Oh hope that doesn't take it off
crispy-looking mad somebody asked in the
comments how I get my arms to be like
tan or glowy
well like 90% of that is the fact that
I'm Mexican and Spanish so I just
naturally have dark skin and I tan
really easily but sometimes a trick I
like to do when I'm going to events at
night I like to apply a little bit of
tanning oil to my arms just to give them
that really nice glow and it just makes
you look like I don't know like like
very glowy so I'm applying 10 tanning
oil and I just really like it smells
divine
okay so that completes the look today I
hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial and

stuff going on on YouTube because of
