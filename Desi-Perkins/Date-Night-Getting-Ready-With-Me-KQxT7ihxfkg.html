date so I decided that I would just fill
my hole getting ready process for you
guys and take you along so
so first thing first you want to prep
your skin I'm using my Murad essential C
cleanser and just washing my face as
normal then applying my serum to help
with any scarring or anything like that
next I'm taking my moisturizer and of
course you want to apply that all over
the face don't forget the neck as well
on a date we want to look polished that
includes your teeth and your smile this
one is by crest and it's the 3d white
and it is the brilliant system it's two
steps so the first one is just to deep
clean your teeth and before rinsing you
just apply the second one and this is
the whitener so it's gonna make your
teeth super white and I know you guys
are thinking ain't nobody got time for
two steps but this one is just two
minutes it's same amount of time you
would brush your teeth with a normal
toothpaste and I use this as my daily
go-to toothpaste not just for date night
now we can go ahead and get started with
the makeup first I'm gonna do is prep my
skin using the cover effects
illuminating primer
Foundation I'm using the the this fit to
me matte and poreless
you guys really really liked the makeup
look that I did for the NYX face awards
and since I was gonna do that look
tonight again I decided to film it for
you guys alright time for the brows I'm
gonna run a little bit of the anasazi of
Beverly Hills clear brow gel through
them real quick I'm using the Marc
Jacobs ash brown eyebrow pencil a car
about those brows and highlight the brow
bone using a little bit of concealer I'm
not really too familiar with get ready
with me videos to be honest I know
people like fast-forward through that
like I don't really know I don't know I
think I did it get ready with me once it
was so dramatic
I remember there was like a candle
burning it was just like I think there
was like wine good please do not judge
my fingernail I know you guys are
looking at it I know you're judging me
right now I see you guys we're making
moves make a move I'm the eyelids I'm
using the Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
you
so the palette I'm going to be using is
the lorac Pro palette this is the matte
one I've been using this a lot lately at
the shade linen which is just like a
white creamy shade pop it on the brow
bone and then pull the shadow down into
the crease for the lid I'm just gonna
pick up this pink mauve shade
take a clean blending brush and just
soften those edges out
go into the crease with Lotte
blend out those edges we're going to go
ahead and take this mica
Beauty cosmetics liner this is like a
felt tip liner and I'm going to create
my wing shape
really just like to fill it in with the
Inglot gel liner it does not smudge on
me front of your come twos so next what
you want to do is take a small brush
with black eyeshadow and I'm gonna smoke
out the wing a bit nice um so as I get
to this outer V area evers left over on
my brush and kind of run it back up into
the crease and I'm gonna conceal my
under eyes using the eight cosmetics by
by under eye let me be set the under
eyes with a little bit of setting powder
this is by Laura Mercier
now we're going to finish off the eyes
I'm going to use the same black eyeliner
on the outer part of my lash line I'm
going to smudge it before I move on to
the other eye because once this liner
sets can't really move it stays put so
I'm just taking this small little shader
brush and buffing that out I'm use
corduroy here but if you place your
harness on my head
