today I'm actually gonna be filming a
look using the new chocolate bar
actually it's not that new I'm a little
late to the game but you guys have been
requesting that I do a look on this Too
Faced chocolate bar palette this is the
second one it's the semi ups it's the
there we go it's the semi-sweet
chocolate bar palette I've done a
tutorial using the first one and if you
guys haven't tried these palettes they
are amazing mostly because they smell
like cocoa cocoa puffs and they're
actually made from real cocoa powder and
if you guys are looking for a good
everyday palette this one's actually
really nice because it has a ton of
neutral shades some matte some shimmer
and there's only one you know bold color
in here and that's this blue one right
here but besides that everything is
super soft I decided to create an eye
look that is pretty much a staple it's
just a really pretty bronzed I look with
a little wing and you guys can pair this
with any lip color literally every lip
color will go with this eye look so I
think it's a very good eye look to know
I'm doing full face today a foundation
everything so if you guys are interested
in this makeup look then keep on
watching so for the look we're gonna
start with the eyes just so that our
face stays clear of shadow I'm gonna use
Mac soft ochre as always to prime my
lids but I usually use concealer to
clean up my brow I'm just gonna use this
for everything taking a little bit on
this angled brush this is by Mac Daddy
hey do you guys follow him on Instagram
you should it's fabulous
he did a collaboration of brushes with
more feet which I also love and this is
one of them there's like a set so for
the rest of the lid I'm just gonna take
this fluffier brush it's synthetic so
it's okay to use with the base and I'm
just gonna kind of lightly blend it over
my lid I'm gonna use the chocolate bar
palette by Too Faced this is the
semi-sweet smells like cocoa puffs like
I always do I'm gonna use this cream
color all over the lid on a flat brush
and this is just to make things easier
to blend I do this step every time every
eye shadow look because it just makes my
life easier if I don't do this I find
that eye shadow sticks to the base like
the base could have certain patches and
if you do this first it'll eliminate any
patchiness and it'll just glide right
over the eye shadow next of course you
guys know we're gonna do the transition
shade this is also one of Mac Daddy's or
angel Medina I think I'm gonna go into
peanut butter just because it sounds
delicious but this shade right here just
peanut butter this nice warm shade
basically just building up the peanut
butter shade into the crease and making
it nice and smoky so now I'm going to go
into hot fudge which is this color right
here and I'm gonna use my Mac 217 brush
for this I'm just gonna deepen up the
crease
mostly focusing it on this outer Quanah
now that we have put a little bit of
depth into the crease I'm gonna go into
this color here
this is cocoa chili it's a really nice
deep brown and it has gold flecks in it
so I'm picking that up with my I just
drew a blank my two three four luxe
smokey shader brush by zoeva and I'm
really gonna pack that onto the brush
and just pack it on to the lid
so now that we have this really nice
smokey Miss around the eyes I want to
brighten it up a bit so I'm gonna go
into caramel which is this shimmery the
shimmery gold shade right here and I'm
using a detail shader brush by Zoe and
I'm just kind of fading it into the
matte brown shade here
so before I finish off my eyes I'm gonna
do my foundation and I'm using my usual
lately which is the Mac Studio Fix fluid
whoo instant even skin tone glorious
thing all right so I'm using my I do not
know what brush this is I don't know why
it doesn't say it just has a bu does
anyone know what that is B it's time for
concealer I am gonna use this new
concealer by Maybelline I don't know if
it's new actually it's new to me because
I just bought it but it's the Maybelline
master concealed by face studio I have
no idea if this concealer is good we're
gonna try it out right now it's pretty
light I could probably have gone with
medium but let's just pretend we're
going for that whole like you know
highlight Kim K look so the consistency
of this is pretty thick after we've
applied concealer you want to set your
concealer right away I'm using another
new product that I just got
it's the Kat Von D shade light palette
contour and highlight colors look really
nice they're very cool toned for the
most part and I like that for contouring
I'm gonna go ahead and take the lightest
shade it's a matte shade and I'm gonna
use that to highlight under the eye area
and also we're gonna set the concealer
that way as well I'm gonna use this elf
blush brush which was recommended to me
by lustre luxe here on YouTube it's
really soft I've been using it lately
and I love it for the under eye area
because it's just perfect shape and it's
only three dollars so you can't really
beat that so now I'm gonna go ahead and
contour the face I might as well just
finish the face while I'm here let's
start off with this light shade in the
middle here which is shadow play just
cuz I don't know how pigmented these are
and I don't want to go in too strong
with the the darker shades so I'm gonna
start with this one just to test it out
and I'm using the zoeva did I say that
already I'm using this away of a 114 if
I didn't already mention that so what I
like to do is kind of just create a
light line where I see my cheekbone and
then feather it upwards
I'm gonna contour my nose somebody is
the lightest shade and contour at the
sides of my nose with this and I like to
take the lighter shade the highlighting
shade in the center of the nose and just
kind of put not that much on because
that's a lot I'm just gonna kind of
highlight the center of my nose take
some of that off I went a little I'm
going to use this Milani baked bronzer
and this is in the shade Oh for glow
because I want to glow I'm going to use
this brush here which is another all
these gold brushes are the morphe
macdaddy collaboration brushes so let's
just put that out there sometime keep
saying the mack daddy morphe brush then
I have to say the number which is
letters and numbers which is confusing
me which is a c5 109 that's pretty I
went to the drugstore or Target and I
got a lot of stuff my dad got mad at me
he said
that's my how he speaks he's from Texas
so he's like Desiree or I don't know how
he says my name for blush I'm gonna use
Milania as well and this is in
bellissimo nikkietutorials uses these
and I decided that I want to use them
too because it looks really pretty
alright so for a highlight I'm gonna use
these cindy lou manizer usually I use
Mary all right change of plans I'm gonna
use the Mary one trick too I just love
this highlight you guys I'm sorry I love
it
so already I'm creasing so I don't
recommend the concealer that I just used
cuz it's making me look old so I'm gonna
go in with the Milani liner and this is
in brown and I'm just gonna start lining
my lower lash line with this
that's creamy I'm actually gonna kind of
bring this down pretty low cuz I'm gonna
smudge it out so I'm just taking a
pencil brush and smoking that Brown out
I'm gonna go back into the peanut butter
color here that we used in the crease
earlier this one right here and I'm just
going to use that shade to smoke out the
liner on our lash line
I'm gonna go into this really pretty
gold pigment when is my bell appear and
it's in the shade a celebration and this
is just a nice mineral powder I'm gonna
take it on the same pencil brush that we
were just using and pop it on to these
inner corners so I'm going to go ahead
and line my eyes and give myself a cat
eye or a wing and I'm going to use this
Coastal Scents liquid liner this is in
the shade jet has this nice little tip
here so that it's easier to create that
wing
I'm gonna apply some mascara and pop on
some false lashes these ones are a
little bit more fluttery they're called
glamorous and they're from socialized a
lot of you guys ask me what lash glue I
use and I use the House of lashes lash
glue it is the stickiest lash glue I
have ever tried if you cry if you have
watery eyes it adjustable not come on so
for this eye look it's pretty neutral
you can pair this with any lip color
that you guys want red nude green I
don't know whatever you guys want to do
I'm gonna use this liquid matte lipstick
and this is by this is actually an
extreme matte tint and it's by Kaelyn
and this is gonna have a nice matte
finish
