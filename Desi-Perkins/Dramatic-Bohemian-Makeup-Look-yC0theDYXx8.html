let's get started with this bohemian
makeup look I'm going to start off by
applying this five and one cream
eyeshadow and this is by bare minerals
and this is going to serve as a really
nice base for eyeshadows to stick to now
I'm going to go into this quad and pick
up the color fate and I'm just going to
pop this into my crease using a fluffy
blending brush to darken and define the
crease a little bit more I'm going to go
in with this dark brown pigment it's
called smoke quartz and I'm just going
to use the same brush and pop that into
the crease slowly building up the color
just to define the crease so it's nice
and smoky now I'm going back into that
quad and I'm going to apply this shade
here called magnetism I'm just going to
pop that on the lid packing it on with a
flat eyeshadow brush now go ahead and
pick up a black liner and I'm using a
pencil because I really want to smoke
this eyeliner out and I want it to be
really soft so I'm just going to first
apply it closest to the lash line just
to make sure there's no gaps between our
lashes and our lid and then I'm going to
take an angled brush and really start to
blend that out
I'm also switching to a pencil brush as
you guys see here just because I found
it was easier to smoke that line out and
I'm also applying a little bit of a
black eyeshadow to the brush just so it
gives it that nice gradient effect that
you guys see happening here so I totally
thought going into this look that I was
not going to have a wing but you guys I
can't help it it's just something inside
me says Mae going the little voice so
I'm just taking black eyeshadow and an
angled brush and making a little baby
wing
alright guys so I did apply a little bit
of a brown eyeliner to the lower lash
line but then I changed my mind so I
decided to move on to concealer first
that way you guys know it's easier to
blend the eyeshadows on top of that so
I'm applying the concealer and now I'm
just going to go back in over that brown
liner with black just because I wanted
this look to be a little bit more
intense now I'm picking up this reddish
brown color and I'm just going to use
that to smoke out the lower lash line
just so it's not just a black line you
want to really make it Smokey and hazy
picking up my bare minerals lash
domination mascara I'm going to apply
that to the lashes and the way the wand
of shape is going to make sure to coat
all of the lashes then pick up a pair of
your favorite falsies and pop those on
so once you've popped on your eyelashes
your eyes are done and then you can move
on to your face I'm going to apply some
of this bare skin foundation which I
really am loving right now just buffing
it into my face making sure it's all
even guys know the drill now I'm just
going to apply bare minerals well rested
under the eyes just to brighten them up
go ahead and take your favorite setting
powder and just set any areas of your
face that may tend to get a little bit
oily for me that's my t-zone so make
sure that's nice and powdered and now
it's time to warm up the skin so pick up
a bronzer make sure it's a warm one
because you want that Sun glow and I'm
just going to apply that in all the
areas that the Sun would naturally hit
your face so now it's time for the lips
and I was really debating between nude
or red but I decided to go red because I
wanted it to be a little bit more
editorial and dramatic so apply a red
lipstick this is called a shots and then
I put on this headpiece to kind of
finish the look which I made I used to
make jewelry back in the day when I was
I don't know just into making jewelry so
that's the finished look you guys I hope
you love it if you're interested in any
