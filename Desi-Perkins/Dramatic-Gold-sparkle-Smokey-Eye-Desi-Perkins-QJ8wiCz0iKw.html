today's tutorial is actually a requested
video by one of my subscribers she
tweeted me and asked me to do a makeup
look from a photograph that she tweeted
me let me show you guys what it looks
like right here so this so I tried to
recreate something similar to this look
and I thought it was so beautiful and I
always love when you guys tweet me
photos because honestly as youtubers we
run out of inspiration and ideas there's
only so many makeup look so you could do
to be honest so if you guys are
interested in how to get this makeup
look then keep doing what you're doing
okay so the first thing I'm going to do
of course is prime my face using the
cover effects illuminating primer I've
been loving this one lately I'm going to
be trying out a new foundation today
this is my cover effects makeup Shayla
talks about it all the time like crazy
and her makeup looks focus all the time
so we'll see I'm in the shade g60 I'm
gonna be applying this with a Beauty
Blender ooh actually this might be a
really tan for me the word is gonna be
real tan today that's okay
so if you like the really Dewey Dewey
foundation it has good coverage I'm like
really doing right now though I
definitely is a foundation that you have
to powder afterwards before moving on
I'm just gonna set certain areas of my
face with this coverfx powder because it
is really really dewy I'm going to
lightly dust this powder over areas that
is like you know doing the most with the
do I'm going to go in with my Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot and prime the eyelids a
light buff over the lids going into
Anasazi Beverly Hills of Blanc and a
fluffy brush and I'm going to go ahead
and highlight the brow bone with this
shade and also set the rest of my cream
base that we just put down just a light
fluff of this over the lid for the
crease color I'm going into anastacio
Beverly Hills desert sands it's a very
camel light color and I'm going to be
using this japonesque brush this is the
835 blending brush I'm going to put this
into my upper crease okay if it falls
onto the lid because we will be putting
a dark color there anyways
and I like to keep my eye open when I
flick this out kind of like so next I'm
taking this japonesque this is the 836
brush and this is very similar in shape
to the Mac 217 brush that I love only
this one's cleaner because it's new so I
just wanted to give you this is like a
drugstore dupe this is at Ulta so give
you a comparison of the two brushes I'm
going to take this brush and going into
the new Anasazi Beverly Hills palette
this is called the shadow Couture
palette and I'm going to pick up fudge
which is this rich brown basically going
to deepen the shape that we just created
but take it directly into the crease
this time so I'm going to pick up this
shadow and just start popping it into
the crease and I'm really putting the
brush into the socket a little outer V
action going here
we're just going to take this all the
way into the inner corner here
I really need to accentuate the outer-v
I'm picking up bandit this is from
colour-pop and a flat shader brush I'm
just gonna go ahead and pack this on to
the lid this color is showing up a
little bit more red than I would like so
I'm going to mix it in with fudge the
color that we used on the crease because
I want the lid to be super dark so you
guys can just actually use the same
color that you used in the the crease
because we want it to be dark like that
really smoky eye so yeah
scratch fudge I mean scratch bandit
we're just using the fudge color budge
village
so now we're going to do the fun part
which is the glitter and I haven't used
glitter in a long time I am going to use
a little bit of mixing medium by Mac
compliments of Katy I borrowed all her
glitter today so I'm just taking that on
the back of my hand and I'm going to use
a synthetic brush to apply this it just
looks straight and then just kind of go
up the center of the eye I'm going to
take a little fluffy synthetic brush and
pick up some glitter this is a lot
number 82 oh wow that looks a lot
different than I expected oh that's
coming off a little bit more red I
wanted us to look more gold but that
pigment just kind of looks pink so over
top of that I'm going to take a
different glitter couldn't get all of
that pink glitter off so we're gonna try
to overlap it with another glitter a
little technical difficulties we're
going in with Inglot 62 glitter which is
very gold
focusing most of the color in the center
then you really want to just kind of
take some of the product off and diffuse
the edges of that
so now I'm going to go in with a little
bit of concealer this is a Dior skin
star concealer and this one is really
good for under-eye dark circles because
it has a lot of peach in it but what I'm
also going to do with this is kind of
clean up the outer edge of the eye then
I'm just going to blend it out with my
Beauty Blender and to really brighten up
the under-eye just because this look is
pretty smoky and dramatic I want to have
a really nice highlight I'm using the
japonesque Velvet Touch concealer and I
tried this out last night oops
I tried this out last night it is a
really bright like it's a little bit too
light for my under eyes but I don't know
I really like the way it looked as like
a under-eye highlight and it's really
creamy so I'm just going to apply this
more as a highlight and this is a this
video isn't sponsored by japanesse I
keep using their products they did send
me the products to try out but these are
the things I have really really really
liked and this is a this is a concealer
brush it's a 915
did I tell you guys what shade this was
in this is an o2 so now once I have my
concealer on I'm going to do the cooking
method with the laura mercier
translucent powder and I pick it up with
my Beauty Blender and I'm just going to
apply this under the eyes especially
since I used like that really creamy
concealer I don't want it to go anywhere
so I want to make sure it sets I'm
putting it on my chin dipping my nose
and I'm going to take the concealer
brush and just lightly apply some right
here the center of my forehead
just because this foundation is pretty
dewy I don't want my forehead to get
doing so I'm just going to go in with
that same concealer brush that I've been
using and lightly dust that away you can
let this sit for a lot longer but I'm
not that patient and I just want to just
kind of get it done you know
so that's just going to make sure that
all the creams that we put under our
eyes you know don't start getting all
smudgy which is going to really brighten
up the area under the eye as well I'm
actually going to pick up my Natasha de
Nonna this is the glow palette in oh one
light with the same brush and I'm gonna
apply my highlighter before my bronzer
I've been doing it lately and I just
feel like it looks nicer so I'm going to
apply this on the tops of my cheekbones
this brushes everything and I'm taking
um this is guilted honey I highly
recommend this highlight so beautiful
this is by Laura Geller and I like to
apply this with my finger I know I'm
already really highlighted but I just
kind of want to pop this right at the
high points you guys can just do one
highlight but you know I like to do the
most
I'm also going to apply that gilded
honey on the tip of my nose and on my
Cupid's bow for the bronzer you guys
already know I'm going to use Mac give
me Sun and I'm gonna apply an all-over
bronze with this using the mac 135 brush
it's pretty large and in charge but it's
it's like skinny so it works really well
in these areas and of course as usual
you want to apply bronzer along the
hairline as well and then we're gonna go
in with blush this has been my favorite
blush lately especially for a bronzy
glow II look because it has a very warm
sunkissed undertone this is hot makeup
wonder lust blush looks like these Meeta
so pretty and I'm going to use that with
my Mac one to nine breath I like to make
a little get that Apple going I know I
just scoop under and up just to really
accentuate that cheekbone even more if
you have a rounder face you may not want
to do that you may want to keep your
blush more in this area to make it look
thinner to finish off the eyes we're
just gonna finish off the lower lash
line and add lashes so I'm going back in
to Desert Storm and I'm going in with a
defined crease brush by makeup geek
we're just gonna smoke out that lower
lash line this is gonna be the base
color of the lower lash line
kind of bring it up into that wing a
little bit going back into this palette
I'm taking fudge once more the dark
brown color you're going to smoke that
lower lash line oh you guys know I love
a smoky lower lash line if you don't
like a smoky lower lash line you don't
have to do this you can just add a more
subtle lower lash line shadow
it looks really intense right now but
once we put the glitter in the center
it'll kind of not look as crazy okay I'm
taking a little bit of black eyeshadow
and defining the inner and outer corner
of the lower lash line just a bit
I'm gonna first apply a little bit of
this metallic gold eyeshadow from the
same honest hacia palette and I'm just
going to apply that in the center of the
lower lash line see how that looks first
and then we may add glitter afterwards
but the glitter gets really messy and
I'm not sure I want to deal with that
again so I'm gonna spray a little bit of
fix+ on it so that it gets more metallic
II ooh see mmm does the same thing pop
in then for my inner corner highlight
I'm going to use the same laura geller
gilded honey highlight the pencil brush
and just pop that in this area here it's
a little bit more of a champagne color
so it's not going to you know be too
much with the gold that we have going on
we just need to apply some lashes so I'm
just going to go ahead and curl my
lashes and apply my Tarte lights camera
lashes mascara and I think we all
already know what eyelashes somebody is
I'm sorry I just feel like the iconic
looks so good I can't really wear any
other ones I mean I'll try to start
using more eyelashes but for now
Mini's ikonics so I'm gonna do that off
camera and I'll be back now that the
eyes and everything else is done lastly
we have the lips I'm gonna do a nude lip
because I want to look very neutral and
glowy and just in the nude family I'm
using stripped-down lip pencil by Mac
I've been using the sext lipstick this
is by Mount cosmetics I like to dab a
little bit of this in the center of my
lips because it is a little bit too nude
for me altogether but if I apply this in
the center it's going to give a more
plump lip effect so just take a little
bit off it's crazy right now I know
picking up Mac's
naturally transformed lipstick which is
a more brownie nude just going to kind
of go over it
and then lastly to add a little bit of
pink this is my concoction of lip
products because right now looks little
chalky so we want to add a little bit of
pink if you are more tan some nudes will
look a little bit more chalky on you if
you're more fair-skinned you can get
away with neuter nudes but for me I need
to add a little bit of pink so this is
the honest hacia Beverly Hills lip gloss
in undress
alright and that is it and we're done
with the makeup look alright so that is
