morning then this is the video for you
today's video is gonna be a hair
tutorial my friends this is my hair
naturally air dry I know you guys enjoy
when I do my morning hair posts on
Instagram stories and snapchat showing
you the many ways that my hair decides
to dry this is just one of the ways
every day is different like a surprise
once I showed my foreign after of how I
smooth out my hair just using a curling
iron you guys all wanted a tutorial so
here I am doing a tutorial first things
first my friends brush your hair once
you brush your hair it's gonna turn even
frizzier especially if you have curly
hair but this is just gonna get all the
knots out we're gonna look crazy for a
second now that we're all brushed out
I'm just gonna go ahead and part half of
my hair up into a clip out of my way
boom simple simple this is a really
important step this curling iron I swear
I don't know if it's this curling iron
that particularly smooths out my hair I
have tried to do this with like a Hot
Tools curling iron and it didn't really
work
I still use hot tools for other things
like beach waves and stuff like that but
for some reason this infinite Pro con
air it always smooths out my hair you're
gonna want to take about an inch section
it's really important not to take a
section that's too big and I run it
through a couple times and once I run it
through a couple times then I take it
all the way to the ends you know
sometimes when you do beach waves you
want to leave the end out but right now
we're frizzy we need to d4 is first I
just run it through sometimes I'll even
break it in half
you get to the base one more time just
to get really really close and run it
through boom as you guys can see this
curling iron in two seconds took out the
frizz and everything and I have no
product in my hair however I probably
should have heat protectant but half of
the time I'm too lazy and I don't
usually use it I don't hold the curl on
the barrel for very long because I don't
want it to get too curled throwing it in
and keep it moving this is the start of
a smooth process and look how easy that
was and I always brush it out unless you
really really want like a curl then
don't brush it up
for me I just like to use it to smooth
out my hair and give an effortless look
it's like a Pantene pro-v commercial I'm
telling you magic I don't know what's
going on this is sorcery compared to up
here like what I've going on this this
this
let me tell you if you're trying to
smooth out frizz you have to work in
sections you skip a section you'll have
a frizzy piece of hair just poking
through somewhere and you really have to
go through and smooth out every piece I
want to start with this piece because
it's less intimidating not as close but
you see how I go through at the base
then I'll curl all the way to the edge
grab the piece and you just run through
the base to get close to those hair line
hairs and then you take the rest of the
hair and you curl it particularly as you
get to the top of your hair for most
people that's where it's the frizzy
assess where you do the most damage to
your hair that's where most people get
more highlights you just do more heat
styling up there because you care about
the top more once you get to the top
sections you diligent to get those
frizzy areas the good thing about doing
your hair this way is that you get to
sleep peacefully not worried about
having to drown brush your hair and
second of all I find that when I round
brush blow dry my hair I end up curling
it anyways on top of that this just cuts
out one of the steps so I don't put as
much heat on my hair now because I'm
just smoothing it out and not having to
blow-dry it I don't know why I set this
on my ig stories but I just love
drugstore curling irons I've tried other
ones like you know ones that people tell
me to get fancy ones and I swear they're
not as good since I've been putting less
and less bleach in my hair
I've been doing that for a reason as you
guys can see like this is all my natural
hair color right here and I've been
doing that because I'm trying to get my
curl back the more bleach I put in it
the more I kill my curl so I know I see
some comments of people saying like oh
we miss your light hair and I'm like I
know me too but I also want my natural
hair texture back and the more I damaged
it the less it comes back I'm sure I'll
go light again in the summer sometime
but I'm just trying to be healthy let's
do this side honestly I find this method
to be like a lot faster to no I'm just
gonna be continuing the same method all
throughout if you have extra extra curly
hair and a lot of us tend to have like
really frizzy areas like right close to
the hair
usually this smoothes it out but there's
days where my hairline is trying me and
it gets even curlier and frizzier there
that's when I'll just take a round brush
and blow out just my bang area like the
hairline let's see if I can get it all
smoothed it out with the curling iron
first today I never ever take a
straightener to my baby hair it's like
ever curling iron is one thing but like
when people take a straightener to my
little baby hairs I get so concerned
when they do my hair all that does is
make them stick straight out every
single time no I'm just working up
towards the top and all these pieces I'm
curling away from my face even the front
when I go down I just go down but then I
curl away depending on how you like to
part your hair I'm gonna go ahead and do
a center part today but just part your
hair that way sometimes too it's kind of
like however my hair wants to part I
have no say in the matter this is how
broken my hair is okay like this is
trying to catch up to this length right
now this is pretty much it now it's all
smoothed out it's bouncy it has a nice
wave really this tutorial is about just
how to smooth it out at this point
typically I would add some extensions to
my hair just because I like more
fullness you don't have to you obviously
another tip like I was saying earlier is
if you don't want your hair to be waved
you just want more of like lived-in hair
I just take the last inch and stick a
straightener to it and kind of
straighten it inwards so you know how
this just kind of looks a little bit
more beachy and this side it's like a
little bit more waved at the bottom
that's only if you want the straight
ends right the smoothing out part all
you eat is the curling iron if you want
to straighten the ends then you could do
that too typically for a day-to-day
basis I don't really put product in my
hair
I don't really love that much product
the only thing
we'll put in it is a little hair oil
this one is by way just one drop and
I'll run it through the ends and like
through the frizzy parts at the top
right here where all my little baby
hairs are broken I'll just run a little
hair oil through there we're already
done with the tutorial okay I'm just
taking it a few extra steps if I'm
feeling extra frisky like okay I want
some volume
I want a little something-something I
use the Armco this is the dry shampoo
paste so one thing I will say about this
is I only use it when it's like I'm
going to an event I want my hair to look
a little bit more fluffy because I don't
like to dirty my hair if I don't have to
because I already have such a like
frizzy texture the more product I put in
it like weighs it down the dirtier it
gets I know some people like to put
product in their hair to dirty it up
because it's so silky but I don't have
that problem I mean if I can avoid it
I don't put hair product but this stuff
is a dry shampoo I like to take this and
just kind of this motion run it through
the hair especially towards the root to
give myself a little bit more lift so
really get it through the roots perk it
up alright guys so this is it this is
the finished look
it was super easy to do so much easier
than giving myself a blowout and then
curling it after it cuts out a whole
step because nobody wants to be up at
night after they shower giving themself
a blowout with the round brush and the
blow-dryer getting high you're gonna
sweaty and all you want to do is watch
Netflix you know I hope it works for you
guys let me know in the comments if you
try this at home and it works it would
just make me so happy to know that it
did I hope I can help my frizzy hair
girls out there

my next video bye hello welcome to my
channel what did I do to deserve this
call 1-800 that Friz for $19.99 if you
