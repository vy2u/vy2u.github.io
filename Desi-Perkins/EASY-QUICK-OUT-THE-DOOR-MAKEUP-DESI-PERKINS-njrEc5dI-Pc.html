a 2d video it going to be an easy quick
got to get out the door but I got to
look good makeup look put the title I
just looking to this end this is what I
do when I have to be at a meeting and I
don't have a lot of time to get ready or
you just got to get out the door and be
somewhere this is my go-to and it's been
a while since that's kind of done like
my go-to makeup look and of course this
is the fastest possible way for me to
get ready
I realize looking back at my last two
videos that they're all very and like
more on the dramatic side of makeup so I
just decided to throw in something a
little bit more practical and everyday
for you guys there's no lashes it's very
easy I will show you guys how to get
your brows perfectly even in two seconds
I'm exaggerating it's like a little more
than two seconds I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and let's go in there fun so
first I'm going to apply this new
product to me this is the Make Up For
Ever Ultra HD skin booster I just put
lotion all over my hands and I can't get
this over now so please please just well
Steven helps me open that if you guys
don't follow me on snapchat I just got
like extraction because I had a lot of
congestion thank you so much so I had a
lot of congestion in my skin like I
could feel when I wash my face like a
little ball so I knew that there was a
lot of koala fours and breakouts
especially along here which i think is
very warm onal I also get like little
bumps along my lip line it gets just
from like a lot of lip product clogging
those pores so she went in she kind of
just like pokes it a needle and then
it's really gross but also oddly
satisfying it's so great because these
are all just little scabs but they're
completely flat easy to cover up and
then once they go away it's like your
skin just starts over I'm going to take
some of this serum hopefully it does
boost my skin is actually my first time
trying it make sure I get that on my
under eyes like so before I do any face
makeup I'm just going to let that sit
and I'm eating my brows a good tip if
you're like me you have to build a brow
from scratch you don't just have these
like naturally full brows it kind of
takes a long time to get there and I
feel like it takes me a long time to get
my brows even and I'm spending way too
much time on my eyebrows I decided to go
out to Sephora and pick up these brows
stencils because I needed to know if it
was something that
normal consumer could pick up and
actually use and I was very surprised
that it works for me I'm using the full
arch it's great because when I'm in a
rush I don't have to focus a lot of time
on my eyebrows it's super quick and easy
what I do is I try to line up the line
inside your nose to the arch and then to
the end you try to place it right where
you know your hair is are and there's
different shapes like I said so if this
shape doesn't suit your brow you can
move on to another shape okay so there
it is boom take your brow pencil and
lightly just kind of outline it I don't
press too hard it's really really like
barely filling it in it kind of sticks
to your face too so you don't have to
hold it too hard really filling it in
and you have holes please it looks kind
of crazy right now but it gave me the
shape and then I just kind of go in even
it out and I'm going to soften these
lines by just kind of brushing through
them a little bit really easily if you
feel like any part is too harsh from
stenciling you could just kind of you
know rub it away with your finger and
sometimes just doing my brows with a
pencil when I'm in a rush is a lot
faster and you know we always wish we
could like do a wing and then copy and
paste is kind of what this does for your
eyebrows just put it on the next one
there's a little gap here so you just
have to connect the dots really and then
I just let me kind of go I focus way too
much time and energy on my brows I mean
I love it when I have time but when I
need to be out the door I just don't
have that kind of time but I still don't
want to be looking like one brow here
one brow there you know do you see this
two seconds you can fill it in more like
I you could see I left a little bit of
sparseness but since this is a more
natural look for me everyday look I
don't really feel on that too crazy
they're just kind of run my brow gel
especially through the front hair if you
want to look more bushy more natural
next I'm going to quickly apply my naked
skin by Urban Decay this is a one and
done couldn't be more perfect I'm in
medium dark sometimes when I need to get
out the door quickly this type of brush
just helps me spread the product faster
than a Beauty Blender this is
more feet g36 and you can just kind of
get the product everywhere real quick
I thought you going to be plus Maitland
so gone oh my god kind of crazy because
I felt like I was going to start crying
all the time it was like emotionally
nostalgic it was beautiful it was
magical it was like the scenes they
really just made them look so incredible
and guests on who he was so good like
the perfect Gaston I couldn't have
imagined anyone better it was incredible
so this is just going to go ahead and
even out our skin tone it's not going to
completely cover every blemish I
wouldn't say this is like going to cover
everything but it does a pretty good job
and when I do a more natural makeup I
don't really want something that's too
heavy because it kind of the whole point
of this look for me is to just look
naturally flawless without looking like
you have too many products on your skin
that's like what I aim to do when I do
this look can it go over your lids to my
lids are very red it's just like a
natural skin tone that I have on my
eyelids like a permanent eyeshadow
permanent Sienna basically so I go over
it just a little bit but I don't really
mind it too much I kind of find that
discoloration on your eyes to be kind of
ratty sometimes you know so you should
just embrace it if you have back so
usually for my natural looks I like to
use the becca luminous concealer but I
ran out has nothing rest with scraping
at the edges so another great concealer
I also love the NARS creamy concealer
this one has a little bit more coverage
than the Becca concealer for more
natural days I like less coverage I
guess I wouldn't say less coverage but
something that evens out without looking
like you're wearing makeup is basically
what that one does this one you just got
to apply a little bit less so I'm using
creamy concealer in ginger
I will hit this Cupid's bow real quick
and like right at the tip of my nose and
right here I'm a slight bump but other
than that that's it I'm going to go
ahead and take my Beauty Blender and
just kind of one that I actually use my
fingers from time to time because let's
be honest she all been there when you
need to do your makeup you sit down
you're kind of like rushing to get out
the door and then you're like holy crap
I have to go wet the beauty blenders
bathrooms a little far I don't
time I know it sounds ridiculous but
it's like once you're settled in your
makeup area and you're just trying to
get it going you can take a second and I
need every second there's two things I
spend too much time doing when I get
ready I've kind of narrowed it down it's
bouncing and my brows it's really hard
to get them even you come out your face
from different angles when you do your
makeup
that's why lashes can sometimes be
crooked because you come this way when
you do one lash and then we move your
arms this way to put a lash you're
coming in from the side a little bit
more this is the time if you have
breakouts or something you need extra
coverage go ahead and take your
concealer spot correct of areas boom
done and done I'm picking up this morphe
brush it has no name and I'm taking a
little bit of my translucent powder I'm
kind of just running it directly under
the eyes lightly dabbing that under the
eyes I'm gonna be using a liquid
highlight today this is from iconic
London this highlight is very powerful
so a little goes a long way don't use
too much you are Laurent it's beautiful
so I apply a little bit and then I'm
going to blend it out so it looks very
extreme off the bat but we are going to
really work it into our skin and I'm
taking the B blender also around the
brow bone to highlight this area because
that's another area where light
naturally hit so when you put it on it's
bright instantly but once you work it in
it looks really luminous just captures
the light so nicely look at it boom the
reason I like this especially when I
need to get out the door because you
don't have to really build it it's just
one swipe and you're done of course you
can also take that highlight your
Cupid's bow and your nose so barely
using any of this product is a really
pigmented just a little tiny drop and it
just kind of gives your skin like that
naturally glowy beautiful vibrant look I
love it alright so for bronzer I don't
want to necessarily look like I'm
noticeable wearing bronzer I just want
to tan my skin really quick give myself
a little bit of color quickly so for
that I'm using this NARS brush which is
incredible because it's large it's very
soft it's not too dense to wear it's
going to give you any harsh lines and
I'm using benefit hoola bronzer I'm just
lightly kind of putting it up here in
part of my cheekbone I make sure to make
popular motion just so it's not one
harsh line and I'm also going to bring
it up where the Sun would naturally give
me more color over here sometimes my
forehead looks big so I'll even hit it
right here so it looks a little smaller
or set into my late edges here my baby
quickly over here as well this color
just really gives the perfect not too
orange not too ashy type of sunny look
to my face I really like it for that
brush you have any big fluffy brush
that's ideal that's it for the bronzer
moving on to eyes I don't do anything
with my eyes curling your lashes is keys
especially if you have baby lashes like
me so I just hit them with a curl it
really all depends on what you feel
comfortable with I know some people
don't feel comfortable without a winged
liner I used to be that person so I
understand some people don't feel
comfortable without a little bit of eye
shadow this is just like when I'm doing
this look I never wear eyeshadow or
eyeliner I just curl the crap out of my
lashes and put a little bit mascara
that's who I am these days I know this
may not sound like a big deal in most
people but the other day I got ready to
go out to dinner with my friend I had to
get ready in like 15 minutes which this
is basically me getting ready in 15
minutes and I know it sounds really dumb
but we all have done insecurities from
time to time I don't remember the last
time I've gone out at night without I
makeup I don't consider my Skara I
makeup because for me I don't have
enormous ly large losses where mascara
will make a big impact it's kind of
blended you know I've been using Latisse
though and you can actually see my
eyelashes that is exciting for me
they're not super long yet or super
thick but the fact that I can even see
their existence is just really exciting
so I went out with just mascara and it
was a big deal for me but I saw a
confident about it so I had no I makeup
this was the makeup I wore when I went
out I felt worried about it I'm just
letting you guys know there is something
to look forward to especially if you're
younger you you have like insecurities
when you're younger and then as you
start to get older you start to get like
so much more confident and comfortable
and I think that's the best thing that
comes with age every year you just are
more accepting
and like confident with who you are and
it's a really good feeling so I was
really happy just wanting to play guys
up after you curl your lashes you're
going to apply a waterproof mascara
waterproof is better because it just
holds the curl of your lashes a lot
better and for me I can't afford to lose
the curl I need the curl so waterproof
mascara will really ensure that your
curls going to stay this is the better
than sex waterproof formula I feel like
I can actually judge mascaras now that I
have some eyelash growth here for it was
really hard for me people would want me
to just tell them like about great
mascaras but the only way I could ever
really judge a mascara with how it made
my lower lashes look because I would
wear false lashes on the top all the
time look at you can actually see some
lashes so funny that's so exciting for
me this makeup look may seem like it's
taking longer because I'm chit-chatting
with you guys and filming it like this
but just know that when you guys aren't
here there's a fire under my foam feet
okay and I move a lot quicker I mean I
like to believe so but maybe it's not
sure maybe I don't look quicker and then
for my bottom lashes I've actually been
using the Lancome doll lashes I just
picked this up the other day at Sephora
news to me I heard a lot of good things
about it but it has a very very tiny
little point and I need that for what I
have going on so just lightly run that
on my lower lashes tomorrow
Stephen sisters getting married my
sister-in-law I'm really excited she
just seems like like I always saw her as
like a little baby you know could she
see this little sister and now she's
getting married which leads me to
knowing that I have to do a bridal
tutorial for you guys cuz I know I don't
have one which is kind of crazy I also
wanted to mention if you have oily or
skin and you need to powder I like the
size of your nose or wherever you get
oily make sure that you powder those
areas but leave the rest of your face
like the high points on powder so it
gives you a more natural finish when I
do this I literally just apply my
chapstick this is the Murad suiting skin
and lip cream and I'm out the door so
like this gives me like a glossy enough
look but if you want to amp it up you
could always add a lip color underneath
it's the Velvet Matte by NARS and
is in the shade bull meadow so this is
like something extra now you got to go
to work you got to go to school you know
you want a little light in your face so
you just add like a subtle miss color
doesn't have to be this pink you could
pick any color with this load which is
gravy then I'm going to dab it with my
finger I want to be a little bit more
worked into my lips opposed to a curly
okay clip colors sitting on my skin and
then I'm still going to take my
chapstick because I love the way this
looks it's like a glossy Murad lip
treatment makes you look fresh makes
your lips look nice and juicy this is
usually what I would do out the door
okay but for the purpose of this video
and people who love blush I'm going to
apply a blush if I were to apply blush
it would most definitely be peaches by
Mac this is one of my favorite go-to
blushes with this type of look I like to
put it on the apples of my cheeks I feel
like the apples of your cheeks looks a
little bit more fresh and natural that's
where you get flushed naturally so give
a little smile on boom just a little
color I mean the photo finish primer
water you could use this to prime your
skin you could also use it to set your
makeup so boom and that's it you're done
you're looking good
very simple very fresh so the vibrating
cuz that's one foot off here it may have
taken a little bit longer for me to do
it on camera because I'm talking to you
guys and hanging out but when you're
doing this by yourself you could get it
done I have no concept of time so ten
minutes that in Mexican time means 15
possibly 20 oh I really just don't have
concepts of time I'm being honest with
you guys
but it's the fastest way that I could
possibly get ready so that's what it is
I hope you guys enjoy these like a
simple more easy looks sprinkled in to
the other dramatic makeup looks let me
know you guys think thank you guys so
much for watching and I'll see you later
bye Oh could've losing edges what the
heck are you guys in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
