today's video is gonna be on this summer
makeup look because it is officially the
first day of summer I asked you guys on
snapchat what you wanted to see I
originally had like a totally different
makeup look planned but you guys all
wanted a summer makeup look which I love
giving to you because you know that's my
thing
bronzy glowy and I wanted to make it
really easy minimal product minimal
brushes so this tutorial is very very
easy to recreate the hardest part about
this tutorial is probably applying
lashes if you choose to apply lashes
everything else easy peasy
so if you're interested in this makeup
look then keep on watching so my nails
are so bad bad I couldn't get an
appointment until tomorrow I'll just do
my makeup like this uh-uh just gonna
have to deal with these nails I was
anxious nervous so I just like broke all
my nails off anyway so let's continue so
I'm gonna walk you guys through exactly
what I would do if I wanted to do a
really fast easy summer glam that looked
just excellent honestly for any makeup
look you have to take care of your skin
depending on what kind of look you're
going for you use different products
right now I want to look super luminous
and dewy this is the pixie glow shinde
do lotion and I like to use this because
it's like a moisturizer that has a sheen
to it so if you guys can see right there
it kind of reminds me of Mac strobe
cream going in with Makeup Forever
primer this is the radiant primer like I
said I want to look radiant makeup
forever has a bunch of different primers
so we're just going to apply this primer
so a tip for summer makeup and in my
opinion any type of makeup I like to
apply my brows before my foundation I've
said this in other videos and the reason
I do that is because if you apply the
product over foundation over time your
foundation tends to oil up and wear off
so if you put your brows on top of that
your brows may also tend to fade in your
more sparse areas that's my tip I always
apply my brows first the pencil just
makes the hairs look more hair like when
you do it this way because there's no
like mushy foundation under it so I'm
first going in really
lightly with it cosmetics universal
taupe pencil and I'm gonna do a pretty
natural brow just really quickly you
don't want anything too overpowering for
your summer beatdown
I kind of hate that word beatdown summer
summer thank you some are sliced even
thank you
every time I apply strokes with the
pencil I go through with the spoolie and
this just takes away any extra product
product builds up in one place more than
others it'll kind of just soften it all
up it's key to doing eyebrows I'm
telling you it makes such a difference
don't worry about them being perfect
quite yet because I'm gonna go over them
with another pencil right after so I'm
gonna do a little something to my brows
to just make them a little bit bashir
but I'm gonna wait till after my
foundation I have a few options here
that I like to use depending on what
you're doing like if you don't want to
have too much foundation on I really
have been loving the it cosmetics CC
cream I only like CC creams if they have
good coverage if they don't have good
coverage I'm like no thank-yous this one
I found is really good I'm just gonna
give you guys a few options this is the
Naked Skin one and done
this is a complexion Perfector and it
has SPF this is really good too it's
lightweight it's really nice has pretty
good coverage I think because I never
use CC creams on my channel I'm going to
go ahead and use the it cosmetics CC
cream just to change it up a little bit
this is tan and I actually really really
like this if you have breakouts and you
still want your skin not to look super
cakey use something lightweight all over
your face and then spot correct your
breakouts that way your whole skin isn't
looking cakey you just kind of conceal
the problem areas so that the rest of
your skin can still look nice and
natural that's what I'm gonna do today I
know sometimes you guys think oh don't
break out but snapchat filters really
come through for me sometimes and I will
tell you that I do break out I may have
an insert a photo here of how bad I was
breaking out so you guys know that
you're not alone I like to apply CC
creams kind of like how you apply your
moisturizer because I feel like it's
really easy to apply that way and it
goes on nicer for some reason moreso
than a normal foundation I usually don't
apply normal foundations with my hands I
could even put it over your lids if you
have discoloration real quick so now we
kind of have like
and even base and then you want to go in
and conceal any breakouts or
pigmentation that you have I really like
using the derma blend concealer is a
good one if you have bad breakouts and
you really want to cover them I also
like the HD concealer by makeup forever
for blemishes and I just use my finger
my crusty nail top it over the area and
then I get a brush to kind of really
blend it together alright so now we've
concealed our blemishes I like the look
we can still see skin it's not like
super over the top so if you have under
eyes to conceal just take a little bit
of concealer and apply it there just
taking my Beauty Blender and blending
that out so we're gonna find like chin
the Cupid's bow on the tip of the nose
so I'm just gonna set the under eyes
really quick using the Kat Von D contour
kit I like to use this peachy color and
just a dab of this light color and sweep
it under the eyes I don't want to apply
too much powder but I do crease so I
have to set the under eyes this is a
dose of colors setting powder brush so
next I'm going to use NARS Laguna liquid
bronzer I wouldn't recommend it for
people with deeper skin tones because as
you can see here it's very very subtle
so I'm just going to apply that to the
places that the Sun would naturally hit
your face not being super precise you
don't have to worry about making sure
your extra contour it or anything just
want to give a nice sunkissed look and
this is a really subtle shade I would
recommend this for anyone with I
wouldn't say super fair but light to
medium skin tones
even putting some over the nose area to
look like the Sun kind of just kissed me
sometimes I'll even just apply that
liquid bronzer with a highlight on my
skin and concealer and no foundation and
all its really nice as well so if you
want to skip a foundation or BB cream
that's something you could do also next
I'm going in with the Marc Jacobs
highlight this is a cream highlight and
it's in the shade spotlight and I'm just
going to apply that my mom's gonna watch
this video and be like I see what's
going on with your now how do you know I
already know Mom blend it out with the
Beauty Blender so it melts in with the
rest of the face I'm gonna go right over
that cream highlight with a powder
highlight because I like it intense I'm
using the laura geller gilded honey and
the anastacio highlighting brush damp
the brush with whatever settings for you
have and then I like to swirl it in the
highlight and apply it right on the high
points of the face then a little C
formation here I'm going into my lorac
ten Tango palette here and I'm taking
tan Diego
a little bit of Cabo San Lucas on my
dose of colors powder brush feel like I
just want to tan up my skin so I'm just
gonna lightly apply this on the outer
parts of my cheekbones just dust it over
the forehead temples nose so I'm just
gonna move straight on to the eyes now
and the eyes are gonna be so easy I'm
only going to use one eyeshadow the and
then the number six ix
this is from Suva beauty and I actually
just tested these last night and I
really really loved the way they looked
so I decided to use it in this tutorial
I'm gonna apply it with my finger it's
gonna be so easy and I'm just gonna pack
it all over the lid I don't even feel
like I really need an eyeshadow base
with these eyeshadows because they're
super pigmented I will say it is nice
that I don't have a nail on this finger
because I can pack eyeshadow on really
easily and then you're going to want to
take a blending brush what's cool about
this eyeshadow i quickly tested it on my
eye before this tutorial and even though
it's gold it blends out orangie
it looks like I've used two eyeshadows
one in the crease and one on the lid but
I've only used one so it's really fast
and it looks really really pretty I'm
also gonna take that eye shadow this
time on a brush this is the luck see 2
to 3 brush and I'm gonna run that along
the lower lash line I think that I want
to add a little bit more of a matte
shade on the lower lash line this is
caramel by Anasazi Beverly Hills it's
gonna make it pop a little bit more down
here this is just my under eye setting
powder brush and I just kind of like
blend the edges a little bit here bronzy
if that's the look you're going for
lastly for the glow on the face I'm
going to use Mac's gold deposit it's key
to use this product for me at least with
a Mac 137 or any brush that's really
fluffy and soft and not super dense
because you don't want to apply too much
of this but we're trying to glow today
so I like to apply a light layer of this
over everywhere I applied bronzer and
because this brush isn't super dense it
applies less product so you're not gonna
look really Gracie I think I'm going to
try to use the Pat McGrath nude shiny
stick and there's a bomb on one side set
it over the highlights of my face you
want to look glossy dewy maybe even put
some of this on my lids actually a
little maybe like in the inner corners
of the eyes a little bit we finish off
the brows now that we add the whole face
makeup
I'm gonna take my Anasazi of Beverly
Hills brow Wiz make Swift strokes
upwards to kind of give a little bit
more of a messy brow kind of look so now
we have a little bit of like a messy
bushy brow which is what I kind of
wanted with this makeup look and then
for the lashes I'm going to curl them
with this lash curler this is the best
lash curler I've ever used in my life
the only eyelash curler that's ever made
it look like I had eyelashes at all and
then I'm going to use waterproof mascara
this is the Too Faced better than sex
mascara the waterproof version find that
waterproof mascaras make your eyelash
curler than normal mascaras do it's a
bitch to get off but it stays curled
and if you have little lashes like me
you need them to stay curled if you have
a lot of lashes naturally I wouldn't
even wear false lashes with this look I
would just stick with like a lot of
mascara and natural lashes I'm also
going to apply mascara to the bottom
lashes using my 8 cosmetics mascara I'm
going to do that off camera because it's
really hard for me to do it on camera my
lashes I'm going to be using pixie looks
by house of lashes so that's the lashes
on now we're going to do the lip this is
by Too Faced it's one of their new
melted matte liquid lipsticks and it's
super bright orange
this is the lip color and Miss wrapper
are oper roper I'm not going to use the
lip liner because I don't feel like you
need to with this I tested it before the
video and it actually applied really
nicely with that one I slightly over
lined this side more than this side with
the lipstick but let's just ignore that
you know I have this breakout here and
it's really bumpy so I'm going to make
it into a beauty mark real quick I'm
gonna use the Cypress number you guys
could use any dark brown eyeshadow this
is from the Anasazi Beverly Hills
Renaissance palette on an eyeliner brush
and I'm just going to go right over like
very lightly over the breakout and we're
going to turn this bitch into a beauty
mark real quick you want to go over the
beauty mark that you make with your
powder so that it looks like there's
makeup sitting on top of it so it's like
a little less fake looking and now to
completely finish off the look I'm gonna
use the coup de lis beauty elixir spray
this is kind of like a fix+
type of spray drench myself in alright
and that is it for this makeup look
super easy to recreate minimal product I
really hope you guys enjoyed it I love
this look I think it's gonna be so
stunning for a summer event if you guys
have any coming up let me know what you
guys thought of it in the comments down
below and I'll see you guys in my next
video
oh my god I can't get over my nails
oh whatever let's move on II can't speak
nope nope nope don't pause don't pause
