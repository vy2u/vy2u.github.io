today's video is gonna be a makeup to
Tom this look right heal a holiday look
that was easy I only used one eyeshadow
I applied it with my fingers and a
little bit of glitter the only thing
that's like has some level of difficulty
is obviously a winged liner but I do
give you a tip on how to make it a
little bit easier on yourself and of
course if you don't want to add the wing
you don't have to so I really hope you
guys like it I kind of just wanted to do
one of those oh I have no nails update
no fake nails look at me I also used all
the items in my Ipsy glam bag this month
and you guys this is actually my last FC
glam bag video I've been an Ipsy stylist
for three years now I'm kind of like
graduating so this is my last video with
MC it's crazy it's so crazy but it's
cool to see like all the new Ipsy
stylists coming in just life you know
okay so let's get started with the
makeup tutorial boom boom one of the
items that I got in my Ipsy glam bag
this month was the clear Easter
retexturizing gel and this is just
something that's supposed to smooth and
hydrate your skin it's also supposed to
help with fine lines and dry patches so
you're just gonna want to rub it into
your skin and then cleanse it with warm
water next I'm going to be using this
Hanalei lip treatment and this is just
going to help my struggle lips right now
hydrate them a little bit they've been
cracking really bad so much skin friend
okay so I'm gonna go ahead and apply my
moisturizer drink of h2o by Tarte
it just works so nice it feels like your
skin is literally drinking a glass of
water oh and since I have no nails I
love putting on moisturizer it's like a
thing I don't know why but with nails I
felt like I couldn't really just like
massage my face as well this is a brand
new jar I just we just went through
well somebody goes a little hand with it
I'm not gonna name any names but someone
needs to get their own
it was a coincidence
it was the coincidence that I felt
thirsty at that moment next I'm gonna go
ahead and pry my skin I'm using this one
by me and it's the moonlight primer now
this is really interesting because it's
like a black consistency
just strange I've never seen that in a
primer supposed to blur imperfections is
my first time trying it this is another
item I got in my bag I like to pad
primers and to my skin that way like
packs into my pores pack them in we're
gonna go ahead and move on to the eye
makeup and the eye makeup is gonna be
really simple so I'm just gonna go ahead
and prime my lids first I'm almost
embarrassed to show you guys my primer
because it looks really crusty it's me
Benefit Air Patrol primer I like to just
use my finger know that I can use my
finger I feel like it's so great for me
it's a whole new world I could use my
finger before when I had nails as well
but it just wasn't as easy to do I'm
just gonna go ahead and pop this all
over the lid and up to the brow bone
when I use this primer is when I want my
skin to show through with the Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot I feel like it's really
really opaque and so you don't see skin
through it it's nice because it does
cancel out all the tones that I have on
my lids which you could see the
difference here and here you know I
don't actually mind those tones it's
funny because any time I've ever posted
like a no makeup or a no eye shadow
people are like we can tell you're
wearing eye shadow but really it's just
like I have a discoloration on my lids
so we're just gonna go onto the eye
shadow and this eye look is going to be
really simple easy to recreate I'm gonna
use the Urban Decay Dimond dog shadow
it's like a silver taupe shade but it
has a lot of silver reflex and I'm just
gonna apply that with my finger I'm
packing it on all over the lid it is
weird right a whole new me right now you
guys don't even know somebody left a
comment saying that they love my makeup
looks but they wanted something a little
bit easier to recreate skill level a
little less I totally agreed so I was
like let me make one that's like really
easy but still looks amazing and most of
the time let's get real like when I do
my makeup I never use a lot
shadows actually do a lot less there's
always just like this pressure on
YouTube to be doing like another like
extravagant look and like something
really crazy and like you have to use
all these eyeshadows I feel like you get
carried away a little she definitely
helped me out by giving me that
suggestion so this is me just doing that
like that already looks so pretty I have
to blend it obviously but let's do the
other side now I'm gonna go ahead and
pick up my Smith 230 brush and I'm gonna
use that to buff along the edges but
what I noticed with this eyeshadow is
that it has that silver taupe look but
when you start to blend into it it
blends just the taupe color so it's
gonna look like we have a color in the
crease
there's no eyeshadow on this brush just
blending this out if you want to apply a
crease color first cuz that's like what
you're comfortable with and go ahead but
honestly I don't feel like you really
need you when I want to do an easy
makeup look that I want to look BAM
especially if you're gonna be at an
event with low light I love to use the
Midnight Cowboy from Urban Decay it if
you ever want anything that's gonna make
you Sparkle this is like the best
product my favorite of all times it just
goes with everything so what I like to
do is just put this on top to add more
sparkle but I don't want it to be too
all over the place so I start in the
middle and just lightly grace all over
the lid and then top it with my finger
to kind of like disperse the glitter if
you guys don't follow me on snap I got
to go to the Victoria's Secret Show and
it was like amazing I'm still trying to
get over it if you're not subscribed to
my vlog channel Stephen and I we have a
vlog channel and I'll link it in the
description box we put a vlog of the
trip to Paris and the show and I was
just like incredible amazing like I said
I just watched the show on TV and I was
like wow I can't believe we were there
we're gonna use more of this after we do
our face makeup but right now since I
haven't done my concealer and stuff I
don't want to get it too close to this
area I'm gonna be covering that with
concealer but for now this is what it
looks like oh just wait til you get
under like a low leg it's gonna look so
good I want it to look almost like like
a wet Galaxy lid like a explosion of
glitter if you will almost a little bit
editorial oh yes do you see it do you
see how it looks wet Stephen are you
watching are you looking
okay good I think I'm gonna do a wing
you could definitely not doing and just
add lashes but I feel like I need a wing
for what I have going on if you are not
as comfortable doing the wings liner I
suggest doing an outline with shadow
first cuz I feel like it's more
forgiving it's a little bit easier to
work with so I'm just gonna take any
black eyeshadow here I have a jet-black
lorac palette I'm gonna start at the
corner and head towards the tail of my
brow lightly trace back down towards the
lid that's the hardest part and when you
do it with eyeshadow it's so much easier
and if you mess up I'm just gonna make
up wipe and clean up the edges here now
I'm going to go into the gel liner and
apply that right over the thyromine
so as I go in I'm just gonna sin out the
liner cuz I just want it to be extreme
on the outer part of my eye and not so
much this inner corners I don't want to
cover all that glitter we just put on
just start to fade it into the lash line
so I'm gonna finish off the eyes after
my foundation I'm going to be using the
NARS all day luminous silk in
medium-dark Syracuse and the L'Oreal
infallible Pro matte I'm gonna mix these
two together cuz it's been a winning
combo for me so I just talked to my
little dish here just put a dollop of
that on there the L'Oreal infallible is
in the shade of 108 it's a little light
for me so that's the reason I started
mixing this in there also the pro matte
is really really matte and I love to
have a more luminous look but I just
also love how this wears throughout the
day so I decided to mix the NARS one in
there I'm gonna take a flat carroty
brush this is a f23 I like to mix the
foundation with this flat brush and then
apply it straight onto the face mix is
it really well get a nice smooth even
layer everywhere and then I take the
beauty blender and blend it out
all right so we're gonna move on to
concealer I'm gonna put a little bit of
ginger right here from NARS and I like
to put this really close not really
close but closer to my lash line and
then I'm taking the Tarte shape tape
concealer apply that right on top but I
don't like to take the shape tape too
close up to my crease I don't I like to
take any concealer too close to my
crease honestly but I feel like this
covers the darkness like the hollows of
anyone's eyes really well and I'm also
gonna place that along the sides of the
nose when I first tried this concealer I
wasn't really like shook by it and
everyone kept saying how much they liked
it and I was like I don't know I'm not
sure about it yet I realized cuz like my
under eyes were really dry at the moment
this under-eye concealer is very like
it's set so you don't have to really set
it it's really full coverage for that
reason because my under eyes were so dry
I don't think it was agreeing with me
but now that my skin is like normal
again especially my under eyes are a
little bit more balanced now it works so
good it like covers everything so I get
it now I'm also gonna use it to sharpen
the wing I'm also going to take that
shape tape highlight the center of my
nose keep its bow and chin
using the concealer down the bridge of
my nose makes it look more straight you
can give you any shape that you want
really all right I'm gonna go ahead and
set my under eyes using my Laura Mercier
translucent powder start on the sides of
my nose and then bring it under the eyes
down the center of the nose it's kind of
hard for me to make a straight line
every time I'm like don't up don't
forget since we're letting that sit for
a second I'm gonna go ahead and contour
my nose I'll be using the Kat Von D
shade light palette and use the center
color here this is the one Smith 2:47
fall I'm blending brush a really tapered
fine point so you can contour your nose
really nicely lightly applying shadow on
the sides of the light powder that's
down the center of the nose now I'm
gonna go ahead and just lightly dust
that powder away under the eyes using a
sigma tapered highlighter brush I'm
gonna leave the nose fake for a hot
minute just because I'm not ready to let
that go yet and I'm gonna set my face
using the lemare setting powder kind of
just gonna set my forehead along the
contour areas chin and the nose actually
I'm just gonna wipe that off once I set
the nose so I'm just gonna go ahead and
finish off the face makeup and then do
the rest of the eyes I'm going to use
the Guerlain
bronzer in the shade oh three apply that
with a Smith 112 brush doing circular
motions I also want to apply that around
the hairline as a highlight I'm first
gonna go in with the Ofra shadow in
bliss this could be used as an eye
shadow or a highlight it's actually
really pop in look at that glow it gives
off a frosty glow which is nice because
that's what I want to go with my eye
shadow look taking my bronzer brush and
just running right along the edges so
it's not super harsh obviously I'm going
for like a pretty dramatic highlighted
look if you want to wear it toned down
you can tone it down but if you're
trying to be extra like me then you know
this is what I'm doing wanna glow I want
to look like a glazed Krispy Kreme donut
I want to look like Britney Spears and
I'm a slave for you and what it looks
weighty that highlight honestly has me a
little sugar I know it's
I shadow but I use it as a highlight and
it just oh it may be much too much for
some but nothing I'm gonna be using the
City cosmetics bead matte blush and I'm
gonna go into the more toned down one
over heal this one guava you gotta make
this face so I feel like this skin is
done for now
alright just even will you hit me with
the zoom boom thank you so much honestly
this is like one of the easiest eye
makeup looks I've ever done like the eye
shadow and it's one of my favorites I
will wear this on New Year's Eve and
it'll take me no time I'm gonna go back
into this lorac palette that I was using
earlier this is a good palette when you
need just basic brown and black and just
like the basics so I'm gonna go into
chocolate and I'm just gonna use that on
the outer part of the lower lash line
I'm gonna use my dose of colors pencil
brush to blend that out I'm gonna even
go back into the same color that we used
on our lids the Urban Decay color and
see what that looks like on the under
eye I'm thinking I may add a little bit
of that midnight cough way to the inner
corner here yes I feel like I'm just
going way through my thought process
with you guys this is one of those looks
where it was like you just have an idea
I've never done it before practiced it
but I just wanted to film it so we're
going with the motions right now I'm
gonna go back into that Oprah highlight
or that eye shadow and use it as my
inner corner highlight before I go in
with any more glitter dude this is
honestly like one of my new favorites
and it's the first time I'm using it it
is so bomb or mascara I'm gonna be using
the Maybelline the Colossus bigshot
mascara I just need a nice base for my
false lashes by the way I started using
castor oil on my eyebrows my eyelashes
and I'm about to start using it on my
hair girl honestly it's supposed to make
your lashes your hair grow so hopefully
it works I noticed the other day at the
gym I'm like man I don't have fake
lashes anymore fake hair in my hair
anymore or fake nails probably not going
to put
nails on for like a minute I need to
give my nails a break I need to give my
hair a break I'm gonna give my lashes a
break next week has lashes fake hair and
fake nails again so I'm gonna go ahead
and apply some lashes I'll be using my
ikonics kind of try to apply them like
on the outer outer corner because I want
my eyes to look more like that I'm gonna
use this Hikari felt tip liquid liner in
the shade iris because I'm not using any
bottom lashes I'm just going to do this
trick that I learned from shayla's
channel which is doing little dots if
you do little tiny dots on your lower
lashline it'll like accentuate the
lashes when you add mascara and you
won't be able to see them once you add a
little bit of mascara so I'm gonna try
to build what I got going on my mascara
it's a little well you know we can't say
it in try now we're gonna move on to the
fun stuff I'm gonna do a red lip cuz I
want to be extra festive today but of
course you could pair this with a nude
lip a red lip vampy lip all my dogs are
running around the room right now so
sorry if you can hear them but I'm going
for red and I'm gonna first line them
with my Natasha denote a lip liner in
the shade l16
I'm gonna be using those you a lip cream
in Suri's I believe that's how you say
it if you trying out this Smashbox
instant matte topper you can put this on
top of any like lip cream like this this
one's already kind of matte but to make
it super matte and velvety you lookin
you can apply this right over top
alright so that's it for this makeup -
what did you guys think sometimes when
you make videos you forget that it's
like okay that's a difficult thing
blending is really difficult to getting
the gradient is really difficult so I
want to try to kind of sprinkle in
videos that I know everyone can achieve
and they still look amazing
on a scale of one to ten what would you
guys say in the comments below the
difficulty level of this makeup look is
one being the easiest ten being the most
difficult let me know what you thought
I'll see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
