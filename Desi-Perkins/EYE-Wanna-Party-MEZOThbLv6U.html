hope you enjoyed that little intro of my
friend crispy and I going out the other
night we had so much fun and I wanted to
bring you guys along to get ready with
me so let's get started to start off
this party look I'm going to apply a
bone colored eyeshadow to my brow bone
to highlight and I'm just gonna pull
that down to lid we're gonna pick up a
brown eyeshadow that has really warm red
undertones and apply that to the crease
and i'm just gonna buff that in to
create a nice halo of color around my
eyes
the application of this eyeshadow
doesn't have to be perfect it just has
to give a nice warm smoky haze around
your socket line now I'm gonna go in
with my ardency in smoky shadow stick
and I'm gonna apply this and what I like
to call the sandwich method which is
basically applying the shadow on the
outer and inner corner of the eyes only
and leaving the center of the lid
completely free of this dark shadow just
keep reapplying in the outer corner and
then taking a blending brush and
blending those edges away I'm gonna do
the same thing on the inner portion of
my eye now
I'm just gonna keep applying the product
and then blending the edges so that I
can get a really nice smoky easy effect
now that we've finished with all these
dark eyeshadows we definitely want to
brighten up that lid again so I'm going
back in with a bone color and packing it
on to the center
alright guys so now it's time for the
fun part I'm going to use at this
argentinian mobster liner and I'm gonna
apply it to the waterline as well as the
lower lash line this is seriously one of
the most pigmented eyeliners I have ever
tried in my life
it is super turquoise you guys will see
how bright it is it's like BAM in your
face
to prevent any harsh edges on our lash
line I'm gonna get a blending brush and
just blend away at those edges just a
bit so it becomes a little bit more
smokey and effortless you could
definitely apply a few coats of mascara
with this look and be out the door
however I'm gonna go ahead and pop on
some false lashes and then I'm gonna
take the look even further with a little
bit of blue mascara and if you guys want
to opt for a black mascara you can
definitely do that instead since I used
so many bright colors on the eyes I want
to keep the look balanced so because of
that I'm going to go for a nude lipstick
and apply that
I'm already wearing foundation and
bronzer and I don't think I want any
blush with this look I want to keep it
just bronzy so after you've applied your
lips apply some powder to any spots that
you get oily and that completes the look

ardency in products used in this video
