I've been holding off doing this
tutorial for quite some time just
because oh my brow game is not strong
you guys not at least not naturally but
I get a request to do a brow tutorial
all the time so I decided I'm just going
to do it because I feel like we're
friends now a little bit more
comfortable you know just in general
with you guys I'm just warning you right
now the transformation so let's get
started so I'm going to start off by
using this Mac brow finisher and it's
kind of just like a wax that's going to
hold the hairs in place so if you have
crazy brow hairs like me and they just
like to go grow up and down and sideways
then this is a good thing to use just to
kind of get them all going in the right
direction and then I'm going to take the
spoolie and just kind of shape those
hairs after I've applied that wax to
hold the hairs in place I'm going to use
this a Tarte brow pencil and it's called
Tarte emphasize eyes for brows I'm going
to do with this is I'm just going to
lightly start making hair like strokes
throughout my brow where I have you know
little bald areas
like as I go I kind of brushed through
just to make sure it stays blended and
there's no build-up of color anywhere
this shape is slowly starting to come
together
so as you can see the shape is starting
to build but because I have very little
hair here the pencil just isn't going to
cut it it's going to look a lot lighter
in this area so I'm going to go ahead
and switch tools for the tail of my brow
I'm going to use a dip brow and this is
from Anastacio Beverly Hills I'm using
the color dark brown and I'm gonna apply
this with Moo oh dear
I'm gonna apply the dip brow with a Mac
263 brush and the reason I like this
brush is because it's synthetic hairs so
it works really good with gels if you're
using powder for your brows I recommend
the e 266 which is meant for powders and
now I know a lot of people can't seem to
figure out dip brow I found that the
less product you use the better you
don't want to use too much of this so I
just lightly put some on my brow I mean
on my brush and then I'm going to start
feathering it through and what I do
first is I kind of just outline my brow
I don't want a harsh line but I want
there to be a clean edge so I'm still
feathering it
we barely barely have any of that to fry
my brush
no I like to be optimistic so the plus
side of being bold in my eyebrow area is
that I can play with my shape and I can
kind of create whatever shape I feel in
the mood for that day so
so now that I have my shape and it's a
nice and drawn on there I'm going to
just take that dip brow and start making
feathering strokes to kind of make it
look more full and hair like in these
areas
I've been concentrating most of the
products that I've been placing on this
area of my brows and then heavily here
that's where I don't have a lot of hair
so you want to concentrate the most
product where you don't have hair
because if you put the same amount of
product all over it's just gonna look
the same with your how do I explain this
your Baldr spots are still going to look
lighter because you're applying the same
amount of product on those spots as you
are the spots with hair and then also I
have not put that much product in this
front area of my brow because I don't
really want it to look like a box he'd
want to make sure that all the brow
hairs stay in place and for that I'm
going to use this brow gel and it's from
benefit it's called a gimme brow and
this is so nice because it has this tiny
little brush so that you could really
get into those brow hairs just going to
take this and start pulling these brow
hairs up
this is going to help blend all the
product and it's also going to keep
everything in place as you can see now I
have a regular brow and then here have
no brow
because to see the difference it's crazy
no bro I know I thought I was done but I
forgot my last step that I always do and
that is apply concealer to the bottom of
the brow just to sharpen it up and make
it look nice and clean and I'm going to
use this motives concealer in the color
amber you guys can use any concealer I
usually pick up whatever is just closest
but just a tiny bit lighter that way it
works as a highlight as well some people
like to carve out the top of their brows
but I don't really do that some reason
it just doesn't work for me it just
doesn't look right
I've tried it before alright so I'm
gonna take a little bit of that
concealer on a flat brush and this is a
makeup
concealer brush it's perfect for this
application
all right so just going to take this and
slowly we're going to under the brow
you
as you can see it's really cleaning up
that brown it's also giving us a really
nice brow bone highlight
Oh
so now I just went off camera and did
the other brows and I'll both eyebrows
are done
alright guys so that was the brow
tutorial and I know it was pretty
shocking I know I know I'm like a brown
ninja
I just realized after I filmed this
video that you know I'm kind of a ninja
I'm kind of kind of a ninja yeah so
anyways everyone has imperfections
embrace what you got and you know just
work it out if you don't have a lot of
eyebrows this just goes to show that you
could definitely work it out if you
plucked your eyebrows a lot in junior
high like most people did it's okay I
understand that's what this video is
here for if you guys like this video
give it a thumbs up and please subscribe
if you haven't already and I'll see you
guys in my next video
don't have to use that many products if
you are you know with brow be nice be
nice
I'm just scrambling just talking did I
have a my suppressor okay though no
one's gonna take me seriously without
eyebrows Lee no one no can then browse
