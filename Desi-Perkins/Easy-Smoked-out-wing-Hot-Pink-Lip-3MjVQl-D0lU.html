for today's tutorial we're going to be
doing this look right here I wanted to
really focus on the winged eyeliner and
a bold bright lip I did this whole wing
just using black eye shadow and it made
it a little bit smoky err a little more
sultry and on top of that it's a lot
easier if you guys have trouble with
winged eyeliner this is really going to
be helpful if you guys are interested in
this look then keep on watching so the
first thing I'm going to do is start off
with my pixie flawless beauty primer and
I'm just going to take like a dime sized
amount of this and apply it all over my
face this is going to help my foundation
and it also has a really nice luminous
effect so it's gonna make our skin look
nice and glowy I'm going for that glow
today for foundation I'm going to try
this new foundation it's actually from
my friends line she has an Instagram her
name is makeup by Lilith and she started
her own foundation called Elsie's isn't
the shade natural I'm just taking one
pump of that and I'm gonna use my zueva
powder polish brush I prepped my lips
for the bold lip that we're going to
apply I'm going to use my Pixies shea
butter lip balm and this one's
lightweight so it's not going to be too
heavy to wear later we can't apply the
lip color over it I don't know why my
lips are so chopped next I'm going to go
into my naked skin concealer I love this
concealer and I'm just gonna apply that
under the ass usually I do my eye makeup
first and then my face but today I'm
just feeling like changing it up and I
like to blend out my concealer using the
sculpting brush by Real Techniques
because it has the perfect shape that
fits right under the eye set the
under-eye concealer I'm just going to go
ahead and use my Kat Von D shade light
palette and I like to use the color in
the center here this is pretty light but
I kind of want an intense highlight
today alright so now to warm up my skin
I'm going to use the Too Faced chocolate
Soleil this is in dark chocolate and the
roughly not so much contour but just
kind of warm everything up are you guys
so proud of me that I'm not using give
me Sun by Mac I'm going to go ahead and
highlight my skin I just got this
hourglass ambient lighting palette I'm
going to go for the more Goldy one right
here but maybe mix it with this one here
my Sigma soft blend concealer brush I
feel like it's like the perfect size
okay so I'm going to further the glow
with this Milani baked bronzer this is
in the shade glow how convenient
swirl that all over where we place the
bronzer
I'm just going to take some of the
highlighter and apply it to the tip of
my nose
and I'm using my mary-lou manizer for
this one because it's not really gold or
anything so it's more neutral just kind
of looks better on the nose for blush
I'm going to use one of color pops new
blushes this is in the shade bonus
I'm moving on to the eyes I'm taking my
Mac soft ochre Paint Pot on a synthetic
morphe brush and I'm just going to apply
that all over my lids I'm going to go
ahead and set that eyeshadow base using
a shadow close to the color you guys
could use a translucent setting powder
for this step as well I just kind of I'm
used to doing it this way but any powder
will do just so it's easier for us to
blend out everything so the eyeshadow is
actually going to be really simple for
this look the main focus is going to be
the liner and the lips so I'm just going
to take a caramel color this is actually
the shade caramel from Anasazi of
Beverly Hills on my morphe M
four-for-one blending brush and I'm
going to lightly apply that to the
crease just to give slight definition
nothing too crazy
for the lids I'm going to use this
makeup geek shadow it's called in the
spotlight
I'm also going to highlight the brow
bone
with my mary-lou manizer next I'm going
to use my pixie fairy dust and this is
in the shade brightening bear this is
really good to highlight you can use it
on the inner corners of your eyes or
your cheeks I'm going to go ahead and
highlight the inner corner with this so
moving on to the liner kind of create a
cat eye using a black eye shadow in an
angled brush that way it makes it easier
to do the cat eye if you guys have
problems using liquid or gel
I kind of want it to be a little bit
smoky so I'm going to take a pencil
brush and just kind of feather out the
edges of that black shadow so as I blend
it then I go back in and add more dark
eyeshadow to the lower part of the wing
that way it greedy I'm also going to go
ahead and drag that black eyeshadow on
the outer part of my lower lash line
I actually just applied the ardell demi
whispies and just going to go ahead and
pop one onto the other eye I only put it
on this eye these are a more natural
lash
okay so now for the lips I'm going to go
ahead and line them using my OCC lip
pencil this is called anime
you
and over that amuse my dose of colors of
liquid lipstick and this is in the shade
pinky promise alright guys so that is it
for this tutorial I really hope that you
enjoyed it and that you learned
