for today's video we're just gonna be
doing this really simple copper berry
tones look so if you guys are interested
then keep on watching so I'm gonna start
off by prepping my skin I'm just gonna
pop on this glam glow bright mud eye
treatment you just leave it on for three
minutes and then remove it afterwards
and it's just gonna take away some of
the puffiness under the eyes next I'm
taking my makeup forever HD primer and
patting that all over my skin I'm gonna
take my Beauty Blender and my Mac Studio
Fix fluid and I'm just gonna stipple
that all over for a more dewy natural
flawless type of application next I'm
gonna put on a little bit of my NARS
creamy concealer and I'm kind of gonna
go really crazy with it and just put it
pretty much everywhere on my Cupid's bow
to highlight the bridge of my nose and
apparently I decided that I wanted to
also put it all over my chin and I'm
just gonna use the Beauty Blender to
once again blend that all out looking at
this footage I realize my eyebrows look
super angry today I don't know what was
going on with them but what is I am now
gonna set my under eye concealer with a
little bit of my honest hacia banana
powder to warm up the skin I'm using
Rimmel's natural bronzer and I know it's
shocking that I'm not using Mac's give
me Sun but I really wanted to try some
drugstore products so I really really
liked the color of this bronzer it's
very similar to give me son
however the pigment wasn't as strong so
I had to really build it up but in the
end it looked really nice so I'm just
applying that all over the face and then
to really give me that glow I'm using my
city color sunset bronzer with a fluffy
brush and just lightly putting that over
the bronzer that we have placed before
to highlight I'm going to use my you a
highlighter and tierre and then over top
of that I'm using the Becca highlighter
in opal
to contour I'm gonna take my morphe mv3
brush it's very similar to the NARS it's
just a little bit more dense and I'm
taking my own a saucier contour kit and
I'm just gonna go into the hollows of my
cheekbones with this and make sure to
really blend it out and I'm also gonna
contour the sides of my nose so for
blush I'm gonna pick up color pops new
blush this is in the shade quarters and
I'm just gonna use this Luxy angled face
brush which is nice and done so it's
gonna give you a really nice even
application and apply that to my cheeks
so now moving on to the eyes you guys
have seen me prime my lids a million
times this is Mac soft ochre which is my
favorite eyeshadow base and then I'm
gonna go into my artistry eye shadows by
Makeup Forever and I'm taking this nice
peachy shade and I'm just going to apply
that into the crease with a fluffy
blending brush and I'm being very quick
about this stuff because it's such a
light color that you just don't need to
be super precise you almost want more of
a smoky effect and I'm gonna mix these
two artistry eyeshadows I'll list the
names down below because there's some
crazy numbers and it's just very
difficult to even remember the names to
brighten up the inner corner of my eye
I'm going to use the NYX slim eye pencil
this is in glitter silver and it's just
a really nice long-lasting formula so
that inner corners gonna stay nice and
bright to really intensify that
highlight I'm gonna go in to this teeny
beauty shadow in the shade pearl phase
this eye shadow is actually in
collaboration with Rob Shetty who's a
famous celebrity artist and I'm applying
that to the brow bone and the inner
corner to add definition to the lower
lash line I'm using my Milani pencil in
the shade brown and I'm just gonna make
sure to really diffuse that with a
pencil brush and to soften it just a bit
I'm gonna go back into that Rimmel
bronzer and apply that right underneath
and just to really tie in the warm tones
of our crease and lid I'm gonna take
this really nice red and maroon shade
mix them together and apply it to the
lower lash line as well just so it all
kind of looks very warm you want to make
sure to get an eyelash curler that gets
all of your lash
this is a very lousy look this one is by
a mite and then I'm going to apply a
little bit of mascara this is my Tarte
lights camera lashes mascara I believe
I'm just gonna wiggle out through my
lashes next I'm taking these lashes by
social eyes these are in the shade in
the shade in this style vixen and I'm
just gonna pop these on these are really
fun they're very spiky and just kind of
long and I decided to just play around
with these and I'm then gonna pop on my
house of lashes precious bottom lashes
at first I chose a pink lip with this
look this is City colors flirtini and
this is a hybrid between like a lipstick
and a gloss but then I decided I wanted
to go with something a little bit more
edgy and this is aa Nastasia Beverly
Hills bad girl my hair was looking a bit
crazy so I decided to just spray a
little heat protectant and I'm gonna go
ahead and just straighten it off camera
for you guys voila
so that is the finished look I really
hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial
