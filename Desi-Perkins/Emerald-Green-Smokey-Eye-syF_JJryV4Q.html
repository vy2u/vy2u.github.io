today I wanted to use some of the new
makeup geek eyeshadows and I loved this
really pretty green color and I feel
like I haven't really done a green
eyeshadow look in have I ever done a
green eyeshadow look I'm not sure if
I've ever even done a green eyeshadow
look but it was time for one so I hope
you guys enjoy this I really wanted to
go for like a rocky like a rocker type
vibe really like you know like extreme
and smokey so if you guys are interested
then keep on watching alright guys so
the first thing you want to do is skin
prep this is the Dermalogica breakout
clearing toner and this is going to just
help control oil and prevent breakouts
so if this look is for daytime you may
want to use like a lightweight SPF this
one I have here is very public but the
one I'm going to be using is by ami and
this one is just a really nice matte
finish moisturizer that's going to help
with any oil or shine so now it's time
to get my brows in check because they
look kind of crazy right now
this is the cella brow pencil and
tantalizing taupe and it's a pretty
universal color so it matches a lot of
different skin tones so this is a safe
bet and I'm just going to lightly
feather in the brow alright let's get to
the good stuff now it's time for my
foundation this is a new foundation that
Too Faced is coming out with I actually
color matched myself before I went to
Mexico and I'm a little too tan for it
now but I'm just going to apply it
anyways it has a really nice full
coverage and a really good consistency
so I'm liking that and then after that
I'm going to prime my lids with my usual
Mac soft ochre which you guys see in
every video I'm just patting that on and
of course I also always set it with a
bone colored shadow this is blonde Blanc
Blanc how do I say it you guys Blanc
Blanc for the crease color I'm just
gonna use this bronzer by colour-pop
it's called happy hour it's just a
perfect warm tone you guys know I love
my warm tones I'm just blending that in
with a blending brush and then I'm going
into all Nastasia Beverly Hills red
earth and with this shade I'm kind of
going to start mapping out that very
winged look on the outer corner of the
eye focus it on the outer v and then
lustre luxe keeps texting me and ruining
my voice over
she's selfish of course anyways I'm just
blending this out with a smaller
blending brush I'm going to take on a
Stassi Beverly Hills deep brown this is
a petite crease brush by zoeva and I'm
really focusing this on just the very
outer V and then I decided after
building this color up that I wanted to
deepen it a little bit more so I'm using
black this is actually a little black
dress by honest Aussie Beverly Hills but
you guys can use any black eyeshadow and
I really just focus this just on the
outer V didn't really blend it out too
far so now for the exciting part which
is the lid color this is the makeup geek
foiled eyeshadow and Houdini and I'm
just packing this on to the free space
we left on our lid for this shadow to
clean up and really sharpen the outer
part of the eye shadow I'm going to use
a little bit of my naked skin concealer
and just really clean that up as well as
any under-eye circles that you may have
I'm also going to apply that there and
blend it in with my Real Techniques
brush
so next I'm going to set the concealer
with the alarm or see a translucent
powder which I absolutely love it's
honestly my new favorite powder to set
the under eyes and I'm going back into
the same exact shadows that we used in
the crease this is red earth and a
little bit of that deep brown on the
outer portion of our under eye and then
taking houdini on the inner part of the
lower lash line and the reason I do this
is just kind of to tie the whole look
together if we had that really heavy lid
and nothing on the bottom it would look
a little bit funny so I'm just kind of
making it all blend cohesively and then
take the black eye shadow with an angled
brush and really deepen up the lower
lash line on the outer portion of the
eyes it's time for some winged liner I'm
using my NYC liquid liner here and since
we already have a nice easy guide laid
out for us that we did with the eye
shadow I'm just following that time for
some highlight in the inner corner this
is my mary-lou manizer by the balm I
honestly use this all the time to
highlight my inner corner in my brow
bones you could also use nylon by Mac
it's very similar and we're going to go
ahead and start contouring I'm going to
warm up my face a bit using my cover FX
contour kit this is the cream contour
kit and I'm just going to start really
kind of tanning at my face just a little
bit more since I am a lot Tanner now
than expected which is a great problem
to have and just make sure you use a
synthetic brush when doing a cream
contour because I feel like it just
works better I'm also going to pick up a
little bit of that cream highlight in
the kit with my finger and just dab it
on the highest points of my cheekbones
I'm not going to do any powder contour
today just keeping it with the cream I'm
going to apply a little bit of this
blush this is Mac peaches to the apples
of my cheeks to give my skin like a
really nice luminous look I'm using this
pixie bronzer this is the beauty bronzer
called summertime it's very nice and
shimmery and light I'm just going to
lightly apply that over any areas that I
contoured just to kind of give it a glow
and then going into I make it forever
pro sculpting duo this is number one
it's more of a pinky undertone I'm just
applying that right over the cream
highlight to kind of make it pop you
know I like that highlight to be strong
if you don't want a strong highlight
then you could skip that step onto my
lashes that going for my trusty ikonics
I'm sorry guys I just can't stop won't
stop can't stop hold up and then I'm
going to use my Tarte mascara this is a
light camera lashes to kind of blend my
Naturals to the falsies for the lips I'm
going with a nude lip of course because
this is pretty dramatic I'm using my la
girl natural lip liner first and then
I'm going into the dose of colors lip
gloss this is in the shade undressed
it's pretty lightweight it's not so much
like a liquid lipstick but it's still
pretty pigmented since my hair is on day
three it's a little dirty I'm just gonna
put a little bit of this not your
mother's hair care in it this is the
deja boo' style extender and you just
rub this in your scalp it's also going
to help with frizz ease tame all those
flyaways real quick or you could also
use a lightweight leave-in conditioner
this one is vibe Rio Gio this helps
protect hair especially in the Sun it
actually protects from UV rays with my
bleach chair I like to put this in my
ends oops and lastly I forgot to
highlight the tip of my nose which is
very important for me so I'm going to
use my lucky Beauty rose gold brush and
I'm just going to kind of dip that in
the highlighter and blend it onto the
tip of my nose and my Cupid's bow
because that is something I love to do
with every makeup look it just kind of
ties all the highlight all over the face
together some people don't dig it but I
like it so this is the finished makeup
look guys yes alright guys so that is it
