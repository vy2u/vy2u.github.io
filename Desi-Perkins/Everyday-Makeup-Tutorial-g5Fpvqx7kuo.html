today's tutorial is going to be on this
really nice effortless natural makeup
look this is that kind of makeup look
that you know your husband or your
boyfriend or your crush will just love
because guys love that more natural
makeup look and I say natural because
sometimes I will wear makeup to make it
look like I'm not wearing makeup and my
husband's like wow you just look so
beautiful with no makeup on I'm like
thanks I'm wearing a lot of makeup this
is a little bit more glamorous than a no
makeup makeup look so I think it's
really perfect for school work job
interview anything where you just want
to look like yourself but enhance your
natural beauty this is the perfect look
so if you guys are interested in
learning how to do this then keep on
watching the first thing we're gonna do
is I've been using this makeup forever
primer lately and I want more of a
natural dewy skin type of look I've been
using this makeup forever primer this is
the HD definition primer it's a little
bit more liquidy so I'm gonna apply this
all over my skin pull my hair back
alright so as you can see it made my
skin look super hydrated which we want
for this look next what I'm going to do
is apply some foundation I'm going to be
using the Tarte foundation this is the
maracuja miracle found sealer so I think
this is their new foundation that has
concealer and foundation in one so I'm
gonna try this out shake it first like a
bumble Joe oh it has a little applicator
okay like this so I took a little bit of
that foundation and I'm gonna mix a
little bit more of my primer and just to
dilute it because you don't want
anything too full coverage you just want
this lip to be really natural
yeah maybe it's a little light for me
actually well so with it
guess my neck is a little light I'm just
gonna buff this foundation all over my
skin I'm using a zoeva powder brush for
this oh and by the way I got lash
extensions very exciting so all in all
this is my like first impression on this
foundation and it looks really nice it's
a little it's like a pinch lighter than
my skin tone and a little bit more on
the pinky side but it's still I think
will blend really nicely after I have
all the other makeup on so it's all good
when you want like a more natural dewy
look you really don't want to powder all
of your skin you just kind of want to
hit wherever you get really oily so if
you tend to have oily your skin you
definitely want to powder any of those
spots I get oily around my nose and my
forehead so I'm just gonna put a little
bit of my hello flawless powder on that
I totally forgot concealer because that
foundation threw me off because it has
concealer built in which it actually did
a really good job I didn't bring it up
all the way looks really nice but I'm
just gonna apply a tiny bit of my
concealer right here in these deeper
areas that I have under my eyes I'm not
gonna go all highlighting and crazy with
this look and then if you have dark
areas on the sides of your mouth just a
little bit there - some people have
pigmentation on the sides of their nose
so if you want to just put a little bit
right here I have a concealer mustache
just going to go ahead and use the same
brush I've been using and Pat that in
you don't want to rub concealer you just
want to Pat it in this foundation really
looks nice I'm liking it you guys but
like I said you only want a powder where
you need it and anywhere you apply
concealer you always need powder so I'm
going to use what I usually use the
Anastacio banana powder I'm just gonna
apply a little bit of that under the
eyes with my ELF blush brush
and if you want you can apply this
powder on the parts that you want
brightened up a bit like your forehead
the bridge of your nose and your chin
I think Gracie so the next step is just
applying a little bit of bronzer to give
your face that warmth when you use Mac's
give me Sun bronzer not like that's a
surprise to any of you I'm not gonna
contour today because with this look you
want to keep it on the more natch said
that's my term for natural I just say
natch
we're just gonna kind of warm up the
face not worried about getting too much
of a strong contour just a nice glowy
look I'm using a morphe brush this is
vg8 I'm gonna run that along your
forehead now I'm picking up the city
color timeless beauty palette and I can
never open this palette to be honest
with you cuz I have these Wolverine
anales so this palette has a ton of nice
highlights and bronzers they're
beautiful there's a bronzer a
highlighter and then another type of
highlighter that's kind of pinkier I'm
gonna use the same morphe brush and I'm
gonna go into this bronze oopsie I'm
gonna take this nice gold bronzer and
I'm just going to run this along where I
put the bronzer and you guys can see
like adding a nice shimmery bronzer can
give your face an instant like healthy
JLo glow this is the kind of makeup guys
dig you know what I'm saying like guys
think that they like you when you look
really natural like follow like me you
don't wear makeup and it's like no we're
in a lot of makeup we just don't know
right Jeff going to highlight my face
I've been loving this jus a highlighter
like mmm I posted on Instagram how much
I liked it it's just such a beautiful
cream highlight oh it's in the shade
it's here and I just use my finger it's
easy to apply you just kind of Pat it
onto the high points of your face
any day alright so as you guys can see
now I have that like really nice glowy
look that jus a highlighter is
everything I'm going to go back into
that city color palette and I'm going to
take this highlighting color right here
I'm just going to kind of Pat it on to
the very very high points because I
really love that intense glow that you
can see from space then I'm also going
to take that highlighter on the tip of
my nose and the Cupid's bow for blush I
want to use something really soft and my
go-to is definitely a peach undertone
type blush because it warms up the skin
and I'm going to use the one by
Illamasqua
this is in the shade lovely gonna take
the same morphe brush even if it has a
little bit of the bronzer on it because
it's alright and I'm going to Pat that
onto my cheeks so even though this is a
natural look I always contour my nose
you guys because it's just like my
security blanket I love to do it and it
makes my nose look prettier so I'm going
to do it I'm using the Mac Studio Fix
this is a powder foundation and it's in
the color and c43 this is a lot darker
than my skin tone but it's the perfect
shade for a natural-looking contour
usually I would use my honest hacia
contour kit but since it's more of a
natural look I'm going to use this
because it's not as harsh
so I'm just going to take a nice little
fluffy synthetic brush this is the
morphe g17 and i'm going to blend that
out all over the lid so I'm going to be
using the tartlet palette by Tarte
cosmetics I'm going to use the same
brush just because ain't nobody got time
to switch brushes I'm gonna take this
color here which is called sugar mama oh
wait it's called super mama no it's
called supermom I'm making up names okay
so it's called supermom just gonna take
a little bit of that and set the base
with it just a light layer of it next
I'm gonna go in to this color here it's
called dreamer it's just a nice cool
toned brown I'm going to take it on my
Mac 217 brush and just run it into the
crease so that's it that's all we're
gonna do for the crease the crease we're
going to go back into the city color
palette for our lid and just pick up
this nice neutral shade
while trying to look through the eyelash
extensions like you want to take the
same brown that you put into the crease
which is a dreamer and I'm taking that
on a smaller flat shader brush I'm just
going to run that on the lower lash line
once again you can see it just kind of
gave our under eye a nice natural shadow
for the inner corners I love to use the
mary lou manizer and i take a pencil
brush and a little bit of that I'm just
going to pop it onto the inner corners
of my eyes and if you're feeling frisky
and you want to add a little bit more
you could add some to the tops of your
brow bone as well just kind of gives you
a cohesive glow throughout this part of
your base
oh this step is definitely optional
because I love the look just like this
with no eyeliner if you want to make
your eyelashes look more defined at the
base you know a little bit thicker I
suggest taking a liner and applying it
just at the base of your lashes no wing
nothing like that keeping it really thin
this one is called line me liner by City
color has a nice little felt tip so it's
a little bit easier to get into those
lashes I'm basically just dotting it
along the base of my lash line to make
them look more bold as you guys can see
it just kind of define the outer parts
of our eyes I'm going to then apply some
mascara when I don't have individual
lashes I will use the Ardell whispies
which are the perfect natural lash and
you can just cut those up into little
sections and just kind of pop them along
your lash line
you guys hate when you try to put your
mascara back into the tube and you miss
okay so now it's just time for the
finishing touch which is the lip color
well I'm going to use the Urban Decay
lip liner and this isn't a shade deep
Asli I'm just going to apply this
lipgloss this is really pigmented so to
me it's more like a liquid lipstick it's
called luscious lip gloss my hot makeup
it's in the shade ceremony
so that is it for this tutorial I really
hope that you guys enjoyed this video
thank you guys so much for requesting it
because I sometimes looks are so simple
that I almost don't do them because
YouTube is like you just want to do
everything so dramatic like a fear swing
and like a crazy contour it's just more
visually appealing I guess to some
people so I forget that sometimes just a
really simple fresh makeup look is
something that you guys probably want to
learn about even more because you guys
go to school you guys go to work I mean
this is a perfect makeup look for all
those occasions like I said earlier so
I'm really happy that you guys requested
it and I really hope that you guys
enjoyed the tutorials so yeah if you
guys liked the video don't forget to

I'll see you later but hey guys do I
have a booger

book or good awesome okay I'm totally
