today's video is super exciting for me
because it's in collaboration with
target you guys know I'm obsessed with
target I'm always at target on snapchat
so when they asked me to do this video I
was like yeah yeah I'm gonna do this
video if you guys I was just really
excited so I got to go to Target and get
a lot of makeup that I have tried and
then some that I haven't tried so the
look I decided to do for you guys is one
that was highly recommended by you
anyways my vacation makeup look and
really this has been the makeup look
that I've been wearing every day if you
guys follow me on snapchat I've been
wearing this makeup look and just
interchanging the shadows and the lip
colors but the technique is exactly the
same and once you guys see this video
you're going to know how easy it is to
achieve it's so simple and it's just my
go-to makeup look as well as my vacation
makeup look it's kind of just morphed
into my everyday makeup look really not
only am I going to go into the makeup
but I also am going to go into the
skincare portion of it not only when
you're on vacation but in everyday life
you guys should be wearing sunblock and
protecting your skin very important
don't skip it I'm going to be doing that
as well for you in this video mixing it
into my routine and just bundling it up
into one ball of wonderfulness so with
all of that said let's go ahead get
started so the first step to this look
is going to be skin prep skin is so
important because no matter how much
makeup you apply what's the most
important is how well you take care of
your skin the first step and tip that
I'm going to give you guys that I'm sure
your parents have given you because I
know my mom told me this all the time
you need to wear sunblock I used to
never listen to her because I believed
that I don't know I just felt like oh
latina I don't burn that's not true even
if you don't burn the damage to your
skin is still happening and then as you
get older you're like oh man I should
have listened to my mom that's
definitely me it's also really good to
apply sunblock if you're prone to
breakouts because anytime you get a
breakout on your skin and you don't
protect it it starts to get darker and
it can leave a scar so if you do have
breakouts I always apply sunblock over
them that way they don't deepen and then
leave a mark for a while so the first
thing I'm going to do is apply SPF 30
and this is by bear Republic it's a
natural mineral sunscreen and you want
to apply this everywhere not just to
your face I actually like to Pat
sunscreen into because I feel like it
works better I'm not sure somewhere
along the way I heard you shouldn't
fully rub the sunscreen in that you
should Pat it that it's more effective
could be wrong but that's what I heard
so I've been doing it ever since you
want to apply sunscreen all over your
face your ears because your ears get
wrinkly too when you get older and it's
you know it sucks I'm also going to
apply on to my neck because next also
look kind of crazy as you age so all of
these things are inevitable like we're
all gonna age but you know what if you
could prolong and age more gracefully
than why not I find that you don't
really listen to your parents until
everything they say starts to happen and
then you're like why didn't I listen to
my parents I can't tell you how many
times my mom told me to apply sunscreen
I didn't listen to her this sunscreen is
really nice because it has like a
powdery finish certain sunscreens can
make you look a little bit oily
afterwards this one almost mattifies so
it's really nice plan to your neck your
decollete gotta get it on that decollete
where I work and just in case you guys
are wondering I apply moisturizer and
then afterwards I apply SPF even if my
moisturizer has SPF like I always apply
extra because I'm extra as far as my
skincare all right
so usually want to let your sunscreen
really sink in right now we just don't
have that kind of time the next thing
I'm going to do is pick up the pixie
skin treats this is the lotion lotion
lotion it's the day due this is going to
give you like that really luminous glow
it's basically a brightening lotion so
I'm just going to go ahead and apply
some of that we want our skin to be the
main focus to this look you want to make
sure that you prep it really nicely it's
gonna make the biggest difference trust
so sometimes when I go to the beach or
pool and I just want to look really like
luminous but not wear makeup you know
not wear makeup which is like I want to
wear a little bit of makeup but I don't
want to look too overdone instead of
wearing foundation I wear a lot of
skincare moisturizers sunblock liquid
illuminators and then I just spot treat
with concealer something about having
all the moisturizers anything like this
that's going to give you a glow makes
your skin look radiant and then just
spot conceal what you need to that's
what I do so the last thing for skin
prep is making sure you apply chapstick
I don't really want to have crusty lips
so I always do this before I do my
makeup that way it settles into my lips
before I put any lip products on over it
and then what I do my lip products go on
nicely especially if you're going to be
using a matte liquid lipstick because
matte liquid lipsticks can be drying so
this is super important this one is from
Sun balm and it's the coconut it also
has SPF 30 and vitamin E any chapstick
you guys have just make sure you apply
it my lips right now are actually pretty
cracked it's okay though so another tip
just in case you guys didn't know this
the lower lip is actually more
susceptible to sun damage I'm not really
sure why but it is so make sure you guys
apply sunscreen there too now that we're
done with all the skin here we're going
to move on to our foundation so I still
want to see skin in this type of makeup
look I don't want to cake products on I
want to look luminous of course I always
want to look luminous who doesn't I'm
going to be using the l'oreal true match
foundation and this also has SPF in it
I'm in the shade Sun beige w.6 so you
want to use a damp Beauty sponge to
apply a really nice airbrush finish the
sponge actually picks up any extra
product that's sitting on top of your
skin which makes it look a little bit
more natural and you just want to pounce
the sponge over your skin do not rub
just give a little pout
I mean you guys see me do this all the
time just giving you some tips I'm going
to lightly apply some over my lids
because I'm not going to be using an
eyeshadow base today I feel the most
confident with less makeup I used to
feel more confident with more makeup and
I'm really like happy that I'm at a
place where I feel better with just
what's going to enhance
my natural features i remember if you
would have told me that a year ago in a
bunch now I'll never feel more confident
with less makeup not that I was insecure
without it but I just loved like a full
face of makeup so next we're going to
apply concealer this is the NYX HD
concealer high definition this is in the
shade C wo 4 I like to kind of just give
myself a little design on the under eye
i make sure not to apply it too close to
the lash line because i want the least
amount of creasing as possible also give
myself a nose highlight oops went a
little crooked there and a lip highlight
applying the concealer here is gonna
make your pout kind of come out a little
bit more and then you take your sponge
and blend it all out what I like to do
with blending out my concealer is first
blend out down here and then whatever is
left over bring it up into this area
that way you have the least amount of
product on your under eyes which is
going to cause less creasing it's not
going to look as cakey under there
because especially when you get older
you start to get fine lines and you
don't want to accentuate them by
applying so much product I also don't
like to really set my face too much when
I do this kind of look so the least
amount of product we have under the eyes
but better
I'm a really big fan of liquid
illuminators today I'm going to use the
L'Oreal True Match and this is the Lummi
liquid glow this is golden
I like to apply a little bit of that on
the back of my hand I take my Beauty
Blender and dab it in I'm just going to
kind of go along the high points of my
face and this is going to serve as a
base for any other highlighter that we
apply over top it's also just going to
make your skin look really nice and
healthy and I use the sponge because
like I said it gives you more of a
natural look and it blends everything
together so next I'm going to do a quick
contour my nose just don't really light
one because I feel like I need a nose
contour no matter what makeup look I'm
doing I'm using the NYX sculpt and
highlight this is in the shade almond
light so I'm just going to take this up
the bottom to refine it and bring it in
more and I'm taking my sponge and
blending that out it's nice to blend out
any contours with the sponge that use
for foundation whatever is left over of
the foundation on the sponge is going to
blend the contour a little bit better
and it has like a highlight side so I'm
just going to take the highlight side
and just put it right here and refine
this area as well this is actually
really a good product
I'm just trying it out and I'm really
impressed this color for a nose contour
is really good a lot of times cream
contours can be way too orange for the
nose but this one's really nice very
natch now that we're done with the
creams you can use a powder to set your
face if you're oily then you want to set
the areas that you get a little bit more
oily so for me that's my nose my
forehead and my chin I like to leave
everything else really luminous and
powder free if you have a blemish
want to make sure to set that too I have
one over here you don't want the creams
to move around and your blemish too like
say hello I'm here so I picked up this
at Target this elf contour kit which I
thought was awesome that such an
affordable brand is making a contour kit
because I feel like besides and NYX I'm
not sure of any other affordable
drugstore brands that are
really getting into the powder contour
kit this one is by elf the bronzer
palette so I'm gonna take a fluffier
brush and go into the shade right here
I'm going to take that and start to
build the warmth on my cheekbones when
doing this kind of look bronzer is very
important so you want to take a little
amount of product and slowly build the
color because you don't want to have
like a huge orange streak I've done it I
actually still do it sometimes nobody is
safe you have to be really careful if
you're in a rush to I feel like it tends
to happen to me I'll look at a picture
and I'm like woah what is that as you
can see this is starting to define the
cheekbones a little more I'm just going
to start dabbling in all of these shades
really like I said you want to keep this
look natural and I feel like this shade
in particular is really looking like a
shadow which is what we want see the
difference like look at this cheekbone
cut flat cut flat I'm trying to give you
guys more tips and tricks in this video
opposed to what I usually do which is
just like kind of go through the motions
really quickly like this is a little
more educational you want to focus the
bronzer anywhere the Sun naturally hits
you for example your forehead even
sometimes a little bit on the nose they
are very very light amount just so it
all has a seamless bronze I noticed that
when I do my bronzer I always do this I
have this hand just like here it's
usually lower but it's doing this I want
you guys to know that off off camera
over here to the side chicken cloth is
down here I feel like it gives me
balance I don't know if you want to
sharpen your jawline give yourself that
chiseled look what you want to do is
take some of your colors I dust a lot of
the product off on my hand and I just
I'm going to take it under the jawline
and the reason I take a lot of the
product off you don't want a streak of
orange under your chin and you
definitely don't want it to look like
you have a beard which has happened to
me also I just want to say that this is
really really good this elf bronzer
palette really nice moving on I'm going
into the NYX this is the go-to palette
I'm going to take the highlighter in
this palette it's color right heal and
amazes to highlight I always go heavy on
highlighter and today is no different
I'm going to also go heavy I'm going to
apply to the tops of the cheekbones oh
if you go too heavy you can take your
Beauty Blender and just go over it so
the thing about highlighter is that it
does make texture come out so if you do
have any like bumps on your skin in this
area you want to keep the highlighter
just right here on this part of the skin
with my Beauty Blender since I do have
this dry patch here I'm going over it
just to get some of the moisture of the
Beauty Blender back onto that area so it
doesn't look as dry it's going to blend
the highlighter into the bronzer so it
looks a little bit more seamless I'm
going to take that and apply it to the
tip of the nose of course
the bridge of the nose and the Cupid's
bow lastly for the skin we're going to
apply a blush I'm going to use the blush
in the same NYX palette right here I'm
going to apply that to the apples of my
cheeks I like to apply blush like kind
of an ass-whooping on the cheekbone
motion down the Apple and then up into
the highlight and bronzer just make this
face I like to take a little bit of the
blush and also go like on to the nose
looks a little sunkissed just lightly by
doing that it almost just looks like the
Sun just gave you a flush on your cheeks
and your nose but don't put too much you
don't wanna look sunburned so now the
skin is done we have a really nice fresh
girl-on-the-go makeup look the eye look
is so easy for this every time I'm on
vacation you guys request a tutorial
it's always the same technique it's just
different products but it's the same
technique so I like to take a nice
bronzy warm shade I'm going to use this
one from this palette right here what I
like to do with that is run it through
the crease almost like a wash of color I
don't apply a base and I don't apply a
lip color I just take a bronzy shade so
you're just going to run that really
lightly throughout the crease and when
you get to the outer part of the eye
just kind of come in like a C shape and
blend it outwards this is going to like
really accentuate the eyes without
looking super overdone like you have a
full eye shadow look I bring it on to
the lids sometimes but just whatever is
leftover just so it's one wash of color
over the entire crease it's funny
because I always do this it's one of the
easiest
books that I do I just change up the lip
colors but I wear this one on my
vacation you guys always ask me for a
tutorial and this is as simple as it is
you start to build the color in the
upper crease and into the crease and i'm
placing most of the pigment in the
crease so even though it's just one
eyeshadow it almost looks like i applied
more than one so then you want to take
that eyeshadow on a smaller brush and
you want to really smoke out the lower
lash line so that way you just have like
this really nice bronzy smoke all around
your eyes and i build most of the smoke
on the outer part of the eye slowly
bring the product in the inner corner if
you have rounder eyes and you want to
make them a little bit more almond shape
you want to keep most of the product on
the outer corner and don't even bring it
in all the way just keep it half way
back into my blending brush and just
lightly blend the edges of that so it's
not harsh and it's just a nice soft
smoke around the eyes this is just going
to create such a beautiful bronzy smoke
around your eyes it's going to make it
look like you tried hard but it's so
easy so fast one eyeshadow and you're
good to go if you want to keep it a
little bit more simple and natural you
can not build it as much and just do the
lightest wash in the crease it's such an
easy makeup look it's quick so if you
are on vacation or you need to leave
this is really fast the only other thing
I'm going to do for the eye shadow eyes
is highlight so I'm going to take the
highlight in the palette but I'm going
to mix it with this gold shade right
here just to tone down the whiteness I
want it to be a little bit more bold I'm
going to pop that in the inner corner of
the eye it just really brings your whole
look together and it makes your
eyeshadow look even more like you went
all out it gives you that JLo glow and I
think everybody wants that one though on
vacation they just want to look so glowy
so that is it for the eye shadow for the
eyes it's so easy and quick so it's very
important for a more natural look that
you really curl your eyelashes that way
it makes your eyes stand out since we
aren't using any eyeliner so go ahead
and curl your eyelashes and apply a ton
of mascara lots of mascara especially if
you're not planning on wearing false
lashes just build up your mascara until
your lashes stand out
if you have an abundance of lashes I'm
jealous when I wear mascara doesn't
really do much for me so I always either
just don't wear my scare at all and go
bald eyes or I have to wear false lashes
so I'm going to put some on really quick
and be right back last step of the look
is of course the lips so what I like
about this makeup look is that during
the day I'll wear it with a nude lip and
it's very sunkissed and toned down and
at night I can wear the same exact
makeup look but just wear a bold lip and
for me I love reds and reds that are on
the orangie side so I'm going to first
line my lips using this red lip liner
this is by Revlon I feel like with a
bold lip you have to line your lips just
to get that nice clean feel okay and for
lipstick this is one of my favorite
lipsticks
it's called indie flick and it's by NYX
so it's a orangie red shade and it's
matte let's go ahead and apply that so I
just love this lipstick color you guys
look how much it makes the whole face
just pop even if you want to wear this
with just mascara no eye shadow I think
it looks so pretty especially for spring
just to make sure your makeup lasts no
matter what climate you're in you want
to use a setting spray I'm going to use
the L'Oreal infallible Pro a spray and
set is actually the first time trying
this one give it to me and that's the
last step super easy all done you have
that pop of color you're looking really
springy or vacationy or however you want
to wear this makeup look it's a go-to
and it's so simple you can customize it
if it's too little makeup for you you
can add more or if it's too much you can
definitely tone it down and add less but
the concept of all the things that I did
you could take and just customize them
into your own look and don't be afraid
to wear a bold lip I'm telling you it
will make you stand out especially for
spring alright guys so that's it for the
tutorial I really hope that you enjoyed
it don't forget to give the video a
thumbs up if you did let me know what
your favorite makeup product from Target
is in the comments down below I have a
few but I'm going to say that this one
really impressed me today so it's the
