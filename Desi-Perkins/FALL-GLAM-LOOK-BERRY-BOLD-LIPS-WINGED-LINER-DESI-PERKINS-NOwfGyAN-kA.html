today's video is going to be on this
bold makeup look oh cannolis here with
me she's just acting a fool I decided to
do everything just like really smoky and
dark and vampy because I want to be
really original it is fall and I just
feel like this is something that hasn't
been done before so here yeah hey
no I'm just totally joking with you guys
I I was in the mood I think we all get
in that mood when fall hits like we're
so excited for it and I also wanted to
do a bold brow I recently collaborated
with Benefit Cosmetics if you guys
haven't already seen it I did a campaign
with them along with crispy Katie and
Kristen and we all did a different brow
look and mine was the bold brow recently
the campaign launched in Sephora and it
was so exciting for me because all of us
were on the gondola I actually just went
in there the other day with my mom to go
see the gondola for the first time with
her and she was so excited she was like
oh my god that's you it's so awesome to
see my face in Sephora I just didn't
think that would ever happen so I
thought I'd recreate the bold brow for
you guys that I did in the campaign in
this tutorial as well you guys are
interested in this makeup look we talked
about those lashes right now honestly
Stephens making fun of me let's just get
it out of the way now okay yes I only
have three eyelash extensions left on
this side and one left no two on this
side it is what it is I'm putting it out
there now just let's just accept me as I
am okay so to start off the brow we're
going to do bold brow okay I'm going to
be using the goof proof brow pencil by
benefit I always switch between the goof
proof and the precisely my brow pencil I
like both of them
today I'm going to use the goof proof to
kind of give my eyebrow a nice shape
lightly create a line underneath the
brow to give us a guide then I'm going
to go ahead and lightly fill in
the outer part of the brow this is where
I have the most sparse hairs I use the
shade four in all the eyebrow products
such as closest to my hair color it's
not too warm it's not too ashy it's a
nice medium to darkish Brown depending
on how much pressure you use see if I
was doing a nice natural brow I would
probably be done like right now but
that's not what we're doing today I'm
actually going to end up taking the
precisely my brow and I'm going to
feather hair like strokes in the
beginning part of my brow to kind of
give it a more natural wispy effect I
never like to make my brows too boxy in
the front even if it is for a more bold
brow I still like to keep the front nice
and feathery alright next I'm going to
pick up Cobra so when you take this top
off it has a brush already built into
the product and then you just snap it
back into the cap I like to use eye brow
pomade like this when I want to
intensify the brow and also give some
more hair like strokes in all my sparse
areas when I do the front of the brows I
always make sure to do upward
feather-like motions even if it's a bold
brow you still want to look like a
natural bold brow like you naturally
have bold brows all right then you can
get some brow gel and just lightly go
over to set all the hairs in place so
here you have a nice bold brow and then
you know you can obviously tell the
difference I mean I know I have
naturally beautiful brows but you know
the little unhandsome in there so I'm
gonna go ahead and do the other side and
I'll be right back so now that what I
want the brows I'm going to take a
little bit of concealer and just clean
up underneath the brow kind of
highlights it as well gives you a little
lift then once I do that I just kind of
take um more feet r32 brush it's just a
nice little buffer brush and I like to
blend that concealer down so it's nice
and seamless alright moving on to my
eyeshadow base I'm using Mac soft ochre
I'm gonna use the same morphe brush
and I just like to take a little of that
product starting off on the lid and then
work your way up to the brow bone until
you blend it perfectly with the
concealer that used to highlight you
don't want to use too much of these
Paint Pots by Mac they're not
necessarily eyeshadow bases I mean they
are but they're not like creaseless or
anything like that they're more of like
a cream eyeshadow type of product so if
you use too much it'll get slippery so
you want to make sure to just use a
light layer we are going all the way
today this step gets super repetitive
because I always do it I set my
eyeshadow base with Mac's Blanc type I
just like to set my eyeshadow base and
you guys already know why just in case
is your first time here on my channel
it's to set everything so it's easier to
blend the eyeshadows powder is easier to
blend on top of powder so when you go in
with your darker colors it's going to be
nice and smooth and then I also like to
use this to highlight the brow bone by
highlighting your brow bone with a
brighter color it's gonna make the
shadows in your crease pop even more and
just look overall a lot cleaner all
right so I'm going to go into a medium
brown eye shadow like this one right
here this is from the supa Beauty
palette and it's the shade Madrid but
any medium brown eyeshadow that you have
any old collection will do picking it up
on a Mac 2 to 4 so I'm going to tilt my
head back and follow along the crease
just above it I'm actually going to go
back with the Mac 217 and don't be
afraid to get this color on your lid
because we're going to completely cover
the lid as well
the next we're going to take a deep dark
brown shade I'm going into the dose of
colors ice cream palate eyes cream
palette and I'm going to pick up hot
fudge here I'm using the Smith to 3/5
brush best blending brushes what we're
going to do with this is put it
basically all over the lid and the
crease when I put colors on the lid on
the crease if it's the same shade I
always like to blend the crease part out
first
and then pack it onto the lid just feel
like it gives a better blend when you do
it that way crispy actually taught me
that I used to pack the color on first
and then blend the edges out now nanana
this way is way better
I'm actually gonna pick up this NARS
liner and I'm just gonna pop that onto
the lid just to darken it up because
with matte eyeshadows
they don't always get patchy but I would
prefer to be safe and put a darker base
underneath that way if it fades there's
like a nice dark base going on so after
I apply that I'm just
then going to pack the eyeshadow right
over top so I'm going to go into my
angle
gel liner okay I'm gonna do a pretty
intense wing with this we got our guide
it's about to touch my eyebrow so that
means it's good so now I'm going to go
ahead and put on some lashes these are
in the style Kate by lash boss these
little tools that I'm using are MAC
Cosmetics a lot of different companies
make them I have one from Tarte as well
they're kind of like tweezers but
they're specifically for eyelashes and
it makes it a little bit easier to put
them on so before I finish off my eyes
I'm going to do my foundation my face
makeup I've been wearing the ex1
foundation lately and I've been loving
it and this one's a little bit dark it's
f 400 so I'm mixing it a little bit with
the toasted beige from benefit this is
the hello flawless just to give the
perfect color this color matches really
well with my body I only put like one
drop of the benefit foundation in there
to kind of just lighten it up and I'm
gonna apply it all over my face with a
brush first and then blend it out with
the Beauty Blender I like these e^x one
foundations because they have a really
good range for anyone who has an olive
skin tone so I'm taking my Beauty
Blender and just why does it sound like
I have a cat it only sounds like a cat
right now so next I'm gonna go in with
my concealer this is the NARS creamy
concealer in ginger I like to take the
concealer down the sides of my nose cuz
it Slim's the nose out any shadows that
you have on the side boom that's a lot
of concealer oh alright I'm just gonna
go ahead and blend that all out I'm also
gonna go ahead and take that same
concealer and highlight down the bridge
of my nose
and through the top of the forehead here
anywhere were you have a highlighted
area you want to highlight with the
concealer as well so that you don't just
have white under eyes and then the rest
of your face is tan going into my Laura
Mercier translucent powder I'm going to
set the under eyes
baked if you will I like to put most of
the powder on the side of my nose first
that way most of it goes there and then
I drag it under and out that way less
powders under my eyes I look crazy right
now it's gonna look hopefully better
afterwards
I'm also gonna take that powder down the
bridge of my nose boom boom boom I get
oily right here so I'm just like really
packing on the powder while we're baking
let's go ahead and do our bronzer kill
some time shot away sometimes I want to
use a different bronzer than give me Sun
and then I like wonder why would you
stray from what works I'm gonna be using
the it cosmetics brush this is one of
their new brushes I believe it's shaky
Dookie blush brush
it's called chic blush but I renamed it
cheeky Dickie I'm gonna take that and
start bronzing up the skin give yourself
a nice bronzer helmet once I'm done the
neck - they want to go ahead and take a
nice soft under-eye brush this is one of
my favorites it's the Sigma tapered
highlighter brush the f-35 and you want
to dust away all this excess powder
alright so we're gonna go back into that
light brown shade that we used in the
transition of our crease and we're gonna
smoke that on the lower lash line and
I'm using a dose of colors pencil brush
so once you lay that down take a larger
blending brush and buff that out cuz
this is also just gonna be kind of the
transition shade on the lower lash line
we're gonna smoke it out a lot more than
this then I'm going to go back in with
that NARS pencil this is the dark brown
color and apply that in my waterline and
lower lash line I'm just gonna keep
applying this and then blending it out
with the dose of colors brush and then
I'm gonna pick up the LA girl black
liner and I'm just gonna apply that on
the lower lash line as well to deepen it
up on the outer corners and of course
you always want to blend that out if you
apply it on your lower
lash line so you don't have just like a
harsh black line before I finish off the
face like the blush and highlight and
stuff I want to do my lips just so I
could make sure everything's nice and
balanced because sometimes if I do my
blush first then I don't like the way it
looks at the lip so I'm doing a super
bold lip today I'm using night moth by
Mac to line my lips first or I like to
actually fill my lips in with the pencil
and I do this because like the eye
shadow if anything fades away you have a
nice dark base underneath and the lip
color I'll be using is Oprah Harlem to
highlight I'm going to be using the
extra dimension skin finished by Mac and
this is in the shade beaming blush it's
like a pinky goal to highlight this is
new okay and I'm also going to use that
as my inner corner highlight on the eyes
blush I'm going to be using NARS Isadora
blush it has a nice mob tone that'll
look good with the dark lip all right
and this is the finished makeup look hmm
hmm hmm I really hope you enjoyed this
bold look let me know what you guys
thought in the comments down below and
I'll see you guys in my next video bye
Oh bitch better have my money all right
hey done here we go yeah all right we're
done
it's finished look
nailed it and then have a glass down I'm
down the time that I want to come here
don't let my foundation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
