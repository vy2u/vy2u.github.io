today's video I'm going to be doing a
makeup tutorial a slash review using the
new Efendi
you T by Rihanna products I went through
and mainly focused on all the fun T
beauty products and I kind of used one
from each category and give you my
thoughts and opinions show you guys how
it looks I also went to the launch party
for fun tea beauty and let me tell you
this party was so sick it was just a
really cool setup and Rihanna was there
and I was kind of like dying because she
looked so gorgeous and she's the reason
I fell in love with the color trophy
wife which is this gold highlight here
that I have in the inner corner and this
whole collection is really focused on
skin which I love i think skin products
are my absolute favorite i enjoy new
foundations concealers highlights and
she has a lot of that going on here what
I love about the reviews with this
collection is that I am seeing such a
large spectrum of people review it and
that makes me happy she did launched 40
foundation shades which is unbelievable
and they all have different undertones
you guys will hear my thoughts and
opinions and see just how everything
looks in this video so if you're
interested then keep on watching I've
already primed my lids with the Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot and I set it with a
light shadow now we're gonna take fawn
buy a BH this is a good neutral brown
and I'm picking that up on a Smith 2 3 2
I'm gonna apply this all the way in the
inner corner and start working it out
actually gonna go into a smaller brush
this is a Smith 247 start working here
and then as I get to the end I start to
feather it out that way I don't have
like a really harsh edge next I'm
picking up Sienna you guys remember
Sienna haven't used it in a hot minute
this is the ABA shadow I used to use
like non-stop I'm gonna pick that up
with the 2 4 7 so we're gonna go a
little lower then we put the fawn we're
also gonna take it into the inner corner
I'm also gonna hit it on the outer part
of the eye over here
pretty excited about this Fenty
collection I will say that yesterday I
tried to film and I used the color that
they color matched me to I put it on and
it just made my face turn like pretty
orange and I thought I could just keep
going and I kept filming and then I just
no no no no this is too orange I got to
try a different shade next we're picking
up fudge by abh just a dark rich brown
I'm gonna use the Smith 230 brush we're
gonna start applying that on the outer
part of the eye here I'm also gonna take
a little bit of that fudge into the
crease I'm actually kind of just hitting
it with some buffing motions here so
that it all diffuses then you want to
drag the eyeshadow slightly outwards now
I'm gonna go in with the soft ochre
Paint Pot and a flat dose of colors
concealer brush carve options new crease
I'm gonna pick up no leave from dose of
colors from our desi xkt collection this
is like the perfect bronze okay the
perfect bronze I'm gonna put it on with
my finger at first but then to get to
that crease I'm gonna use a flat
concealer brush this collection is
currently out of stock but it will be
back in stock on Sunday this Sunday
once I get majority of it on I'm gonna
take a little flat concealer brush I'm
going to get really close to that crease
line before I finish off my eyes I'm
gonna move on to the skin and this is
the first Fenty product I'll be using in
the video it is the Fenty's soft matte
pro filter primer so this is a
mattifying primer it does have a light
pink undertone but it's supposed to fuse
into everybody's skin tones it says that
it smoothes the canvas before applying
foundation so it gets everything nice
and baby soft and it has from what I've
seen on other YouTube reviews a very
moisturizing feel which would make sense
because the foundation is superb at this
primer sells for $32 that's a little
pricey for a primer considering the
foundation is $34 so I took a pump on
the back of my hand and I'll just go
ahead and pop this into the skin
especially around the nose area cuz
that's where I tend to get really shiny
and I would like that to be met so it
does have a very light moisturizing feel
not to silicone II it smells soft that's
even a scent smells clean soft like a
new baby moving on to the pro filter
foundations there is 40 shades
this foundation which is crazy I was so
excited that there was so many
undertones because not a lot of brands
have a lot of different undertones and
for me it's like I'm an olive undertone
and everything is either warm or pink
and sometimes neutral and this is a
matte foundation it's supposed to be
long where it's supposed to give you a
filter finish look which I tried this
foundation yesterday when I tried to
film this video the first time a color
didn't look right but the finish was
beautiful you guys will see right now it
just looks crazy good for film and
pictures I love the way my skin looked
so there's that I can tell you right now
it's really nice finish this is a medium
coverage foundation it does say that it
is buildable and it has a soft matte
airbrushed finish instantly smooth pour
diffused shine free finish climate
adaptive technology resistant to sweat
and humidity from trying this foundation
I can tell you that it does feel very
light even though it is so mad sometimes
things tend to feel tight when they're
matte but it doesn't feel that way it
feels really good but here's my dilemma
even with 40 shades I still feel like I
don't have the perfect shade for my skin
tone in this range since it is a matte
foundation from what I've seen and
swatched everything dries down to a
darker finish so keep that in mind when
you're trying it out I suggest if you
buy it in store you know color match
yourself but then give it a second
because it does change let me swatch it
for you guys really quick this is the
swatch of 360 which looks really good on
my skin when I first swatch it but we're
gonna give it a second to dry when it
dries down even though it's an olive
undertone I feel like it starts to get a
little pink can see now this is how it
looks when you swatch it and then this
is what it dries down to this is the
same color 360 it's definitely more
olive yellowy which I like that color
initially these are the actually the
colors that they color match me to one
for one a more tan and then one for when
I'm a little bit less tan 370 is the
first one I got color matched to and
this one has warm undertones so you
could see that it's definitely more of a
warm undertone and then there is 3:40
right here so these are both pretty warm
and actually this is the one that I
tried the first time filming it just
made me look
really really orange so you can see
where I'm in the predicament those are
the colors that would be around my shade
so if you want my shade this is a
problem for us I'm gonna go ahead and
try 3:40 that has the olive undertone
and just see what happens
it might not color match to my skin but
we'll just accept it because I really
want you guys to see the finish it's
incredible and I'll show you guys that
right now I'll be using the Effendi
makeup sponge to apply the foundation on
half my face this is the precision
makeup sponge it is a three sided it
does have that like eggy shape and then
it's flatter on one side as you can see
there and then it has a little edge for
I'm gonna say the under-eye area works
with any formula liquid cream or powder
if you use this wet it's gonna give more
of a light coverage if you use it dry
you're gonna get more of a full coverage
I want full coverage but I'm also so
used to using a beauty sponge wet I did
try it wet last time and it was okay so
I think I'm gonna try it dry just cuz I
want full coverage and then we have the
full-bodied foundation brush this is
also a new a fenty item here this is a
medium density liquid foundation brush
it's designed to give seamless and
airbrushed full coverage I'm gonna use
the brush first I'm like scared because
I know my face is about to turn a weird
color but we're gonna go for it we're
going in with 360 looks good at first
application oh I wish it would like stay
this color because I feel like it would
be really good for the rest of my body
right now so I'm gonna just gonna go
ahead and Pat and lightly blend as I Pat
but I'm not gonna buff and from the way
this looks like it's designed it doesn't
look like it's designed to be buffed
especially with a matte foundation I'm
gonna bring this down my neck
because you know I gotta I gotta have
some connection here or I'm gonna go
ahead and do the other side and I'm
using the sponge this time I think the
sponge dry with this foundation is
better it's pretty soft so it's not
dense or stiff to where if you use it
dry it hurts your face I'm really hoping
that she comes out with dewy foundation
I have a feeling she will she's a pretty
do girl I feel like as it dries it
starts to get warmer and warmer let me
know what you guys think it's hard to
tell because I'm looking at
monitor but maybe it looks different I
go in with my concealer I'm gonna mix my
Becca beige with a little bit of tan
sand shape tape concealers
and I'm going to use this in the center
I'm gonna be using the sponge again to
blend this out using the brush blending
out that forehead with this brush and
down the bridge
you think the concealer really helped
not make my face look as overall more
now it has a little more dimension next
we have the matchsticks which all
magnetized together look at this they're
20 matchsticks and these are for
correcting concealing contouring can use
them anywhere eyes lips blushes or under
eye you can even use it in your crease
if you wanted to but there are some
lighter shades for highlighting some
darker shades for Kwan touring all
different undertones cool neutral warm
and then there's also some shimmer
sticks and ones that you could use for
blush one of these has the name chili
mango which is my favorite name I'm
upset I didn't poop of that chili mango
which is beautiful you could use this as
a blush you use this on your lips
so I think I'm gonna first go into a
highlight one so this is honey this one
would be nice possibly to correct my
under eyes because it does have a
salmony undertone we also have almond
here those are very close to my skin
tone this one is a little cooler then we
have wheat that one looks like my jam
I'm liking wheat see how it has more of
a yellow undertone everything starts to
look pink next to something that's super
yellow which is what I like not too
yellow more of a neutral yellow but that
looks pretty good I'm gonna try that for
my highlighting going into wheat
highlighting the bridge of my nose I'm
curious to see how these are gonna work
over such a matte foundation I think
that out the sponge I really like that I
think it blends out really good then we
have some that are for shimmer so this
one's named blondie look at that that's
so pretty
love this shade this is a cream shimmer
whoo and I'm gonna take that down the
center of my nose okay I'm going in hard
Rihanna at the event looked so pretty
her skin was glowing from a mile away
I think that's what made me fall in love
with it was how
it looked on her and she wore it very
editorial trophy wife so trophy wife is
a kilowatt high light which I love the
name kilowatt you know what names are so
good you're like why didn't I think of
it look at that it really does look like
just a brick of gold I'm gonna go ahead
and take a pencil brush with this so I
just want like a burst of trophy wife in
my inner corner you could do whatever
you want with makeup and this highlight
for example is something that not every
day am I going to wear this but it gives
you an option for a certain look that
you're going for maybe not every day for
me would I wear this highlight but for
example the Pat McGrath highlights the
ones that have the pink undertone that
you're a decent undertone that's also
another highlight that I'm happy I have
the option to use for certain looks it
just looks incredible and I love it woo
I'm also gonna put this on the bridge
here
I'm skipping around here I'm just gonna
finish the under eye really quickly
basically taking all the crease colors
and I'm gonna buff them on my lower lash
line you guys I am extremely excited for
Halloween videos and like I've said
before I don't even have like solid
ideas I have some ideas I can't wait for
the season in general if you guys have
anything you want to see in particular
let me know in the comments below
going in with little sienna no just on
the outer part I want to do a little
contouring now this is kind of what I'm
scared of because this is a creamy stick
and I have a matte foundation but I'm
gonna I'm gonna try it okay I'm scared
to buff over a matte foundation this is
in the shade truffle which is pretty
deep here but why not I want to go in
says that it is a long way or light
matte formula conceal correct contour
which I told you guys earlier can layer
it it's buildable and it has a cream to
powder finish it's supposed to have no
creasing no caking mmm no I'm not liking
truffle with what I have going on we're
gonna we're gonna make moves we're gonna
switch it up boo mocha is a really cool
tone this is mocha
it's very ashy which is good to contour
but because my face is so warm right now
I think see what cocoa is all about that
one let's try it really quick
oh that looks good once it's blended out
still a little warm but I like the
consistency for me as far as like high
light cream sticks and contour cream
sticks I like to use these when I have
like more of a light coverage - no
foundation more of that skin look that's
what I like I like to use these because
I feel like you can really buff them out
blend them and use your fingers and just
be on the go I don't think that's
noticed but even though the foundation
is really matte I still feel like I have
a natural glow coming through that feels
like it give me like a Mac give me Sun
feel like that really nice warm glow I'm
gonna go into the kilowatt highlight
this is a dual highlight I don't really
care for this one that much but I love
this shade over here which is hustle
baby
this one is mean money and it's to me it
looks a little bit more satin and this
one has more of a sheen shimmer which I
like I'm gonna picture if your wife over
this I just really want you guys to see
what this looks like I'm gonna be
glowing for sure I'm gonna be glowing
I'm gonna spray my skin with a little
fix + really quickly and I'm going back
into a trophy wife I am a little scared
to hit up trophy wife but I'm gonna do
it
that is what I'm about to do first I'm
gonna take a little bit of it on the
brow bone no I'm gonna take a little bit
of that put it on the very high point of
my face here whoo and then like blend it
upwards we have the universal Fenty
blotting powder it's just this
translucent powder that's universal it
says it's supposed to absorb shine
diffuse the look of pores I like that
won't cake up into pores I saw an
interview with Joran and she said you
could just keep applying this as you
need to and it's not gonna look cakey
and gross so I'm gonna hit it on the
apples of my cheek here with pores and
just the center of my forehead cuz I
didn't really set any of my makeup with
anything it has this little sponge using
something the same time on my face all
the time not really ideal for me but I
like blotting powders translucent too
because I don't like to put anything
that's too heavy consistently on my face
and I get really shiny around my nose
with that foundation I feel like I'm not
really that shiny I'm just pretty mad so
let's go ahead and finish the eyes I'm
gonna put on some eyelashes and then
we're gonna hit up the lip gloss now I'm
gonna use the Big Shot Maybelline
mascara and this is the Shayla edition
which is the baddest black I love this
mascara I'm just gonna apply a light
coat before I apply my lashes these are
Lily lashes they're the ones in
collaboration by makeup by Samuel and
he's so good you guys should check them
out on Instagram but look how fluffy
these are spiky and pretty I love them
lastly we're doing the lips so fenty
came out with one lip gloss and this is
the universal gloss balm it has that
really oversized doe foot applicator
here peach vanilla scent oh my god so
good and it's supposed to be a universal
Rose nude lip color so we're just gonna
apply that I'm not gonna apply any other
lip oh that's pretty so that is it for
